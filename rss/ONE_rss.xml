No matter how old you are, you can be a little greedy and childish, because happiness is priceless~&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Each of my dolls has its own name , they have different positions to stick to. Some sit on my monitor, some hang from my travel backpack, some sit on my bookshelf, and some are bed pets. Every time before I go out, I put my bed pet in bed and let him and other dolls take care of each other and the house. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(128, 128, 128);&quot;>;Dog thief, 29 years old&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>; I want to stay in Disneyland forever and never leave, because it is the only utopia in the world. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(128, 128, 128);&quot;>;Little princess, 18 years old&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>; When facing someone you like, you always try your best to prove yourself, which is often self-defeating. Sometimes it’s funny to think about it. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(128, 128, 128);&quot;>;Chu Mo Xisheng, 20 years old&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;&lt; p>;I am also happy when the people I like scold me. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(128, 128, 128);&quot;>;Glass, 20 years old&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>; Why on the day of the Dragon Boat Festival, a few days before major exams, the whole dormitory did not review carefully, stayed up until twelve o&#39;clock without going to bed, and still burst out laughing under the bed, and kept hearing the sound of &quot;ju&quot; , is this a moral decline or a distortion of human nature? emmmmm, in fact, we are just gathering people to play Ludo in the QQ game. Although it is just a simple game of throwing dice, it arouses endless fun in us. After all, this is our favorite game in childhood. So much so that when others learned about this, they couldn&#39;t help but say: Are you naive? However, adults are really childish sometimes! For example, if a naughty child from a relative asks for a toy that I had when I was eight years old, I won’t give it to him! &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(128, 128, 128);&quot;>;Wainan Street, 23 years old&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;I still know the second place and suddenly a sentence in Japanese comes up. Here you can imagine the classic lines from the drama. After saying that, I felt so ashamed and so happy at the same time. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(128, 128, 128);&quot;>;Crow, 23 years old&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Every day I would hum songs in and out of the office door when I went to and from work. On the way to and from work, I would meet the primary school students after school. I would follow them to the canteen in front of the school and buy two packs of the 50-cent spicy sticks that I loved when I was a child. Then I would be happy again. Going home, I think back to the freedom of snacks I wished for when I was a child, and I feel extremely happy. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(128, 128, 128);&quot;>;Thirteen, 24 years old&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>; When I eat delicious food, I can&#39;t help but dance and nod. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(128, 128, 128);&quot;>;Jenny, 25 years old&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Every day You should hold a blanket while sleeping. If you can’t fall asleep without a hug, you have to find a blanket when you wake up in the middle of the night. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(128, 128, 128);&quot;>;Haha Luo, 29 years old&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>; I am already thirty, and I video chat with my partner every day and kiss him goodnight. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(128, 128, 128);&quot;>;Pink Bubble, 29.8 years old&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;What is considered childish? If you see a child&#39;s rocking horse in the community, does it count if you ride on it? When you see colorful bubbles flying in the wind, do you just smile happily? When you see a kitten meowing at you, should you stop and ask it if it&#39;s hungry? In this era, the boundaries between adulthood and adolescence have become blurred, and we can no longer tell whether we are growing up or not. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(128, 128, 128);&quot;>;Bai Bai, 30 years old&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Like I like to eat sweets, watch Crayon Shin-chan, look at the starry sky, get rained on, and put my hands in rice buckets. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(128, 128, 128);&quot;>;Milk half-step epilepsy, 33 years old&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;&lt; p>;Passing by a small ditch after the rain, I can&#39;t help but want to build a small bridge over it with mud and branches. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(128, 128, 128);&quot;>;The rice is too hard, 36 years old&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Catch the fart for the brothers to taste, and let them guess what it tastes while yelling. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(128, 128, 128);&quot;>;robin, 37 years old&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Me I really like playing with my son’s toys, maybe because I didn’t get to play with them when I was a kid. I like building blocks with mortise and tenon structure the most, and recently I am obsessed with children’s microscopes. I took the ingredients, the dregs on the ground, the hair of a family of three, and the fibers of sweaters and looked at them carefully. Speaking of disgusting, I also took a photo of the ashes rubbed off my body. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(128, 128, 128);&quot;>;Yabei, 40 years old&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>; Greedy, especially sweet tooth. Luckily I don&#39;t have diabetes. I also like milk tea, which my children love to drink. Coke chicken wings and sweet and sour pork ribs are my favorites. I also have to make fresh taro and manji desserts once a week. When you go out for a walk, you must have a piece of rock candy in your mouth. I have loved sweets since I was a child. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(128, 128, 128);&quot;>;Lao Zhang, 52 years old&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>; Every time you enter your home or bedroom, you have to say hello to all the furniture and shout loudly: I&#39;m back! &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(128, 128, 128);&quot;>;Angelina, 22 years old&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;&lt;/p>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;Editor in charge ：Naneonewenti@wufazhuce.com&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This Q&amp;A is from the ONE Editorial Department WeChat Moments collection.

Data, algorithms, and traffic all make the waking moment more cruel and hollow. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;One&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;After getting up in the morning, Xu Yinghe still received a &quot;Good morning&quot; from Luo Jinan. Like all men and women in love, Xu Yinghe and Luo Jinan experienced the stickiness in the first three months of their relationship. In the fifth month of their relationship, they gradually returned to the plain but sweet good morning and good night greetings. Luo Jinan became obsessed with funds and stocks two months ago. During the chat the night before, Luo Jinan analyzed the trends of several recent funds and decided to invest more. Finally, Luo Jinan invited Xu Yinghe to invest a little in this fund as usual. If she didn&#39;t understand, he could help her manage it. If it failed, it would be his, if there was any profit, it would be hers, and the previous ones would also be settled. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;This will put your mind at ease. ”Luo Jinan said impatiently. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Xu Yinghe vaguely remembered this when she got up in the morning, but she was so sleepy last night that her phone fell by the pillow, and there were traces of the phone frame on her face. Xu Yinghe looked through the chat history and found that Luo Jinan also complained about work problems such as working overtime and not getting enough sleep. Last night, Xu Yinghe was doing PPT while chatting with Luo Jinan. She selectively ignored all this information. In fact, Xu Yinghe has learned the instinct to turn a blind eye to things that are not going well in work and life. Or to put it simply, she has already taken it for granted for many difficulties in work and life. Recently, Xu Yinghe feels more and more that Luo Jinan should figure this out earlier. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;After all, Xu Yinghe gave Luo Jinan a sum of money a month ago, and he also gave some money one after another. According to Luo Jinan&#39;s statement, &quot;If you lose, it&#39;s mine, if you make money, it&#39;s yours.&quot; Xu Yinghe did not receive &quot;compensation&quot; from Luo Jinan. The word &quot;compensation&quot; always seems a bit harsh, and it is not as fair as &quot;unsuccessful&quot;. Luo Jinan complained that his work was not going well, and he was always suspected of evading this &quot;compensation&quot;. All in all, Xu Yinghe&#39;s draft box has never been without doubts. In movies, TV dramas and popular gossip, financial giants and film and television superstars seek advice from experts when doing business, and they always worship the gods of various places. Buying a house also pays attention to Feng Shui treasures, which is essentially a way to escape &quot;unsuccessful times&quot; ” psychology. Xu Yinghe didn&#39;t blame Luo Jinan. He might have just been unlucky recently, had a bad luck, or something else. He didn&#39;t ask her girlfriend to do anything for his bad luck. Xu Yinghe has seen stories on social networks more than once, such as girls cutting off their fingers or arms, and then dripping blood into openable frosted glass pendants and giving them to boys to ward off disasters and make money. The boys were heartbroken and moved, and would not marry a girl like this. This is a story that is both bloody and confusing, with a hint of demented madness. In many folklore, menstruating women mean bad luck. As if menstrual blood and blood on fingers and arms are not the same type of blood, Xu Yinghe&#39;s heart is full of these small but extremely critical opinions on these incidents with pictures and truth on social networks. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Luo Jinan is not within the scope of her criticism. The Internet has only one side, but daily life has countless aspects. Although Xu Yinghe and Luo Jinan met on social networks, they showed up like ordinary couples and had meals and movies together. More importantly, the social networking site where they met was related to Luo Jinan. Xu Yinghe always looks at Luo Jinan through a filter. This filter is related to ordinary people&#39;s imagination of the wealth myth of Internet practitioners. Although she is quite hesitant about this statement, she believes that the definition of the relationship between the two of them should be broader. But clearly, she doesn’t want to be Erica, who attends Boston University. Although the distance between Luo Jinan and Zuckerberg is obviously further than the distance between the Forbidden City in Beijing and the Forbidden City in Shenyang. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Xu Yinghe and Luo Jinan met on the social app founded by the latter. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;二&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;As early as two years ago, social media still played its apparent meaning. Xu Yinghe would often post in the circle of friends Here I share my life and work. Most of them are about how tired I am from work/study/exercise today. I am very grateful to Sister Wang/Sister Li/Sister Zhang for taking care of me, or an 800-word essay analyzing a popular movie. There is pretentiousness attached to the liveliness, and no matter how you look at it, there is a sense of fulfillment and attention that is eager to show off. And Xu Yinghe, who has passed the twenty-five-year-old threshold, will never have this feeling again. After going through a process of trying to show off her youth and so-called talent to those who wanted to see it, mediocrity indisputably befell her. Things like talent that do not exist in the first place may appear to be there due to youth, but when the veil of age is removed, aura is lost along with collagen. After turning twenty-six, Xu Yinghe looked a little anxious. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;My mother called and said that she might not be able to repay the money on her credit card. Xu Yinghe put down the phone and wondered what the problem was. My mother runs a coffee shop in her small town. For the sake of women&#39;s independence, Xu Yinghe firmly supports her. Of course, this support is only verbal. Xu Yinghe lives in a big city and works in the functional department of a small foreign trade company. The salary is not very high and she also has a cat. Everyone knows that the first way for contemporary youth to become poor is to raise cats, and the second is to raise babies. Raising cats can receive more likes from friends than raising babies. Women suffer from postpartum depression, urinary leakage, stretch marks and other permanent injuries associated with raising babies, while raising cats can treat depression. These days, even if I am not depressed, I am embarrassed to say that I live in a big city. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;In addition to the anxiety caused by age, Xu Yinghe is still unmarried and single. Although it is advocated these days that women should not marry or have children to stay safe, but if there is someone around, at least if the cat is sick, there will be someone to discuss how much the injection will cost. Last time, Xu Yinghe&#39;s cat got feline plague. He went to the pet hospital for three days of fluid transfusions, which cost 700 to 800 yuan a day. The doctor said that it would not be cured unless he received imported immune globulin. Xu Yinghe leaned sadly at the pet hospital. The door slowly sat down. Normally, Xu Yinghe would not lose her composure like this in public, but even the only cat around her was leaving her, and Xu Yinghe couldn&#39;t help but burst into tears. At the same time, I also experienced the despair of selling blood and kidneys to treat children in TV dramas, although things did not reach this stage. On the day when she took Maomao back, Xu Yinghe took two days off and shared her grief several times in the circle of friends as if she were in love. Maybe God couldn&#39;t bear to see it, but on the third day, the cat was able to eat something by himself and ran away again. In this way, Xu Yinghe&#39;s cat took a stroll on the line between life and death and then came back. As a result, her circle of friends gained a few more insights about life and death. Right now, my mother can&#39;t pay off her credit card. It would be nice if there was someone around to help her pay off the credit card. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;With a feeling of sadness and confusion, Xu Yinghe pressed the &quot;Borrow&quot; button on Alipay and blocked her mother&#39;s hole. But she would never dare to lend that card to her mother again. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Xu Yinghe also knows that her mother is in trouble. But no matter how difficult it is to be a mother, there are always men around. On the eve of Xu Yinghe&#39;s return home during the winter vacation of her freshman year, her mother announced that she was getting married. Her mother and the man went to the airport to pick her up and take her home. Her mother asked her to call her Uncle Deng. The house was also changed, and the mother moved into the man&#39;s house. Her adolescence, the only time she and her mother spent together, was thus altered. That night Xu Yinghe slept on the big bed with her mother. It was her unique intimate time with her mother. Mother told Xu Yinghe that Uncle Deng was very good to her. Uncle Deng was old and knew how to care for others. Uncle Deng also had a son. &quot;You are going to have a brother,&quot; said the mother, her tone warm, feeling satisfied for her, almost envious: &quot;When the children bullied you when you were a child, didn&#39;t you always want a brother?&quot; &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Xu Yinghe smiled silently in the darkness. Mother can naturally ignore the changes of more than ten years. She will always be her daughter, but she cannot take it for granted. What the mother doesn&#39;t know is that most of the things that the child liked when he was a child, he doesn&#39;t like when he grows up, such as the extra brother. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Although they met later, Xu Yinghe was surprised to find that his &quot;brother&quot; was a high school senior who was three years older than him. He once dominated the science class and failed in the college entrance examination. He was still a legend among the teachers. Although he failed the college entrance examination, he entered a key university in the provincial capital. After graduation, his father ordered him to return to his hometown and work in the only state-owned enterprise in his hometown. On the day they met, Xu Yinghe played e-sports games, watched movies, and drank milk tea with her &quot;brother.&quot; After lying next to her mother at night, Xu Yinghe was still trembling slightly. It was the first time she had been with the boy of her dreams for so long, and it could almost replace all of Xu Yinghe&#39;s high school crushes. He perfectly fulfilled all her fantasies about the opposite sex during adolescence—tall, handsome, and caring. But he turned out to be her &quot;brother&quot;. During the four years of college, Xu Yinghe was full of this unfulfilled affection for his hometown and avoided seeing him. Xu Yinghe got married in his senior year, and he married the daughter of a leader in his work unit. When he got married, his mother bought him a BMW Mini. His aunt said the car was worth 300,000 yuan, and his aunt said it was worth 200,000 yuan. In short, his mother loved him very much. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;After the age of twenty-five, Xu Yinghe also began to measure love with money. This is a way for people to understand things more clearly. It is easier to live in snobbery than in love. Xu Yinghe had never doubted her mother&#39;s love for herself before. But after her first year of work, she proposed to study abroad, and her mother said she lent money to her uncle to set up a factory. In her second year of work, she wanted to buy a house in the city where she worked, but her mother said she would wait for the dividend from her uncle&#39;s factory. Nowadays, house prices have risen several times, but my uncle’s factory only paid out dividends once. The 200,000 yuan from the dividend was used by my mother to invest in her own coffee shop. The coffee shop was not running well, and Uncle Deng spent half of the year in his hometown of Anhui. The only thing Xu Yinghe could do was lend her mother a credit card worth 20,000 yuan. She and her mother are separated by thousands of mountains and rivers, and they cannot accurately perceive the subtle changes and pain in their respective lives. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The only thing that contacts their mother and daughter now is probably to lose weight. Losing weight can crystallize the pain and sorrow in life. After her mother&#39;s operation in the coffee shop showed signs of decline, she became an agent for the sales of a certain meal replacement powder, forcing Xu Yinghe to buy two thousand yuan in one go, and launched a promotional strategy in the coffee shop that the meal replacement powder would be given away with coffee. On the day Xu Yinghe transferred money to her, her mother enthusiastically invited her to join her meal replacement powder business and promised her a 20% sales commission. I have to admit that my mother is far more capable and optimistic than I am. Sometimes Xu Yinghe feels that if she were not obsessed with getting married, her mother&#39;s career would be far more successful than it is now. And if her mother hadn&#39;t been married, she wouldn&#39;t have been obsessed with Lao Deng&#39;s son for four years. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Everything happened secretly. Xu Yinghe fell in love with someone he shouldn’t like. He didn’t study as well as he should, so he could only pretend to live a lively life in the circle of friends. Fragrant and steaming. Who doesn&#39;t know how to pretend? Xu Yinghe is also very good at pretending to love cats to the core. Life is not easy for contemporary people, and performance is always instinctive. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;三&lt;/p>;&lt;p>; Luo Jinan founded a dating app called &quot;Quyou&quot;, which is a dating app for older singles. social platform. On &quot;Quyou&quot;, Luo Jinan graduated from a well-known university and lives in a prefecture-level city surrounding this city famous for its Internet industry. He has a level 10 piano degree and has an overseas study background. He once worked on the Internet where Xu Yinghe contributed traffic every day. He works as a programmer in the company, comes from a well-off family (Xu Yinghe&#39;s speculation), and has a gentle voice (Xu Yinghe can listen to it by paying a little extra money). By spending a monthly membership fee of 66 yuan on the App, you can know the above basic information. If the other party is willing to post the photo, the user can also see the other party&#39;s photo and filter and match according to their own hobbies. In response to possible PUA (pick-up art), the App has issued user anti-fraud guidelines and requires submission of academic certificates, graduation certificates (both from Xuexin.com), IELTS scores, and academic certificates from the Ministry of Education’s Study Abroad Service Center when registering. Waiting for documents. The information is so detailed that company HR can recruit directly on it. Facts have also proved that quantitative indexes can reach the end point in many cases, saving a lot of unnecessary trouble. For example, when choosing a spouse, Xu Yinghe only has vague requirements such as &quot;high education&quot; and &quot;high income&quot;. On the App, every vague requirement has a correct answer. The reason why I decided to go on a date with Luo Jinan was because Xu Yinghe happened to be free that day. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;On a weekend in March, Xu Yinghe went to see Luo Jinan. The meal replacement powder sent by my mother seems to be of some use. The day before meeting Luo Jinan, Xu Yinghe discovered that she had lost two pounds. In the swaying light of early spring, fairy skirts seemed a bit frivolous and childish, while one-step skirts were too formal. After much selection, Xu Yinghe chose a khaki A-line skirt paired with a goose-yellow cardigan, which was cute and steady. It covers the flesh and shows the complexion, and goes well with the orioles and swallows in spring. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Luo Jinan chose a well-known internet celebrity drink shop as the meeting place. This is a strategy used by contemporary young people to meet up. Eating is usually a matter of the second meeting, of course, if there is a second time. Internet celebrity drinks look sweet and lively. They can cover up some of the embarrassment caused by being dissatisfied after meeting a real person, and they are not expensive. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;At 2:30 in the afternoon, Xu Yinghe found a boy who folded receipts into paper airplanes at the Internet celebrity beverage shop on Jianjian Road. This plot was thought up by Luo Jinan, and it is very similar to a rule on &quot;how to create a romantic atmosphere&quot; in the dating advice put forward by KOLs on Douban or social networks such as Weibo and Xiaohongshu. Like most young people, Xu Yinghe follows the advice given by KOLs on social networks when it comes to dating. This kind of suggestion is more precise than Xu Yinghe&#39;s vague feeling, and has more room for interpretation. Each suggestion is followed by long notes, like an unreadable academic treatise. Although these suggestions have been fixed after discussions among netizens, they are not very convincing. On the contrary, they are lingering doubts. Those regulations about &quot;romance&quot;, &quot;love&quot;, &quot;loyalty&quot;, etc., after reading them, people just want to add &quot;anti&quot; in front of these words. However, these suggestions and guidelines are easy to quantify and become models that can be copied and imitated, making it easier for people to click the &quot;confirm&quot; button. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Xu Yinghe forgot to wear his contact lenses when he went out, so he could only find them slowly from table to table. When he found the third table, Xu Yinghe saw a boy wearing big BOSE headphones, shaking his head and typing on the computer. There was a small paper airplane in the upper left corner of the table. The boy is thin and wears glasses. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Looking average, Xu Yinghe judged in his mind while sitting calmly opposite the boy. The boy seemed to wake up suddenly. He looked up at Xu Yinghe and smiled brightly. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Xu Yinghe felt warm in her heart. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Hello, Xu Yinghe, Yingri lotus is uniquely red, Yinghe, she said. Hello, Luo Jinan, Luo Jinan who has no origin of poetry, he said. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Xu Yinghe smiled, and his generous humor made up for the loss in appearance. After the age of twenty-six, Xu Yinghe became very tolerant, a kind of tolerance that grasped the main contradictions and ignored the secondary contradictions. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;That day, Xu Yinghe and Luo Jinan walked on Healthy Road after coming out of the beverage shop. The petals of the magnolia flower fell on their shoulders. We had dinner together again. Xu Yinghe was a little happy, but it was clear that sometimes there was silence between her and Luo Jinan. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Xu Yinghe looked at the phone silently and said, we were silent for two minutes. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Ha, it turns out you are timing the time. Luo Jinan looked a little happy and said that when they were silent, there were actually angels flying overhead. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;How many angels flew by in those two minutes? she says. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Whatever you think is the most important thing. You are happy. He said. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;She was a little sad and a little moved. Ever since he was a boy, Xu Yinghe has never heard the phrase &quot;your happiness is the most important&quot; except in movies and TV dramas. At that moment, Xu Yinghe&#39;s heart was as complicated as the cup of Internet celebrity milk tea she just drank. Although it was sweet enough, there was always a slight suspicion after a rational evaluation of the price and quality. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;But all in all, Luo Jinan gave Xu Yinghe a good feeling when they first met. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;They left their mobile phone numbers. After nearly a month of contact, Luo Jinan told Xu Yinghe that he was one of the founders of the App. Therefore, that App is a testimony of the new relationship between two young people and their emotional hometown. That was also Xu Yinghe&#39;s happiest time. Luo Jinan would say good morning to her in the morning and good night at night. He would complain about working too much overtime and being tired, the late-night snacks provided by the company were unpalatable, and meeting investors too late for meetings. He was filled with the subtle sense of superiority of an Internet founder. Xu Yinghe described the cat&#39;s naivety and clinginess to him. No matter what time you send the message, it will be read and responded to. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Xu Yinghe enjoyed this response. The two of them then watched a movie and had dinner together. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Four&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;What do you think of family? Luo Jinan suddenly sent a message, after Xu Yinghe called him the first money, in the fourth month of their relationship. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;My mother mentioned family problems and suggested that I ask the girls. Luo Jinan&#39;s chats always have a unique lightness and satisfaction. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Xu Yinghe was stunned. I wanted to say that a family is when everyone works hard towards a goal, but when I think about it, I have never used this kind of hard work and have never experienced this kind of hard work. After my mother and father divorced, my father drove a long-distance truck all year round, and the money he earned was used for his grandmother&#39;s medical treatment and for his own drinking. Except for the period when her mother and she were dependent on each other after the divorce, her mother seemed to not care about her family. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I don’t know what family is. Xu Yinghe said honestly. My parents divorced when I was in sixth grade. After that, every Chinese New Year, I spent the first half at my father’s house and the second half with my mother. Live together. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Pfft, Luo Jinan on the other end of the phone seemed to be laughing so much that he bent over. You played in the first half and the second half. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;So I am not a child who grew up in a complete family. If you talk about marriage, I hope you will consider it carefully. At the same time, my mother will not prepare a generous dowry for me. She spent all her money on herself. . Xu Yinghe suddenly wanted to explain this issue clearly to Luo Jinan. Money is a very important thing. After the age of twenty-five, Xu Yinghe also began to measure love with money. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;This is not your problem, you should not feel burdened, Luo Jinan said, you are yourself, and the most important thing is yourself. If you feel so distressed that you want someone to hug you, use this emoticon to give me a hug for you. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Looking at this message, Xu Yinghe was stunned. The most important thing is yourself - no one said this to her. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Don’t be moved by me. Luo Jinan sent another emoticon. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Xu Yinghe was indeed moved. She remembered that when she was in a bad mood, she liked to watch live broadcasts selling goods. Because she can see herself best in the live broadcast selling goods, she has become the target of all the sales anchors on the other side of the screen to please, she is the most important. The sales anchors enthusiastically introduced the products. Toners, lotions, foundations, lipsticks and blushes were all displayed in front of the camera. The male anchors tried on lipstick shades while introducing the products to Xu Yinghe. Is the rotten tomato color suitable for the skin? It can brighten the skin color of girls who are so fair; the bean paste color is suitable for girls whose skin is a little yellow and can make their face look more energetic. These products are all very good, and they are naturally prepared for you who are watching. What you buy is not the thing itself, but the you reflected in the thing. The anchor&#39;s assistant is previewing the products that will be introduced next. All products are low-priced and high-quality. They are indispensable and irreplaceable for you. We know clearly that this is a kind of consumer talk - the product has nothing to do with you and me, and it all depends on you and me spending money. Xu Yinghe still couldn&#39;t resist. She could sit motionless with her pillow in her rented house for two or three hours. When I was with my ex-boyfriend, Xu Yinghe once watched a live broadcast of selling goods. The male anchor hugged his dog and introduced the advantages of a highlighter. The puppy&#39;s paws rested on the host&#39;s arm, looking at the product eagerly. Comments such as &quot;The dog is so cute&quot; were lined up on the screen. Xu Yinghe also joined in the sigh, and her ex-boyfriend who was sitting next to her and playing games was During the break between the two games, he educated her on the nature of consumerism, and finally taught her that &quot;only people without brains are so easily brainwashed by consumerism&quot; and &quot;women&#39;s money is easy to cheat.&quot; &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Although Xu Yinghe didn’t buy anything during the live broadcast. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;After meeting Luo Jinan, this kind of touching became an addiction that Xu Yinghe couldn&#39;t give up in his life. These emotions also removed the doubts lingering in Xu Yinghe&#39;s draft box. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Perhaps out of a compensatory mentality, Xu Yinghe did not mention the money she had given him. The word &quot;compensation&quot; always seems a bit harsh, so &quot;wait&quot; sounds better. Xu Yinghe is willing to wait for the moment when Luo Jinan truly succeeds. She never asked him about the KPIs such as DAU, MAU, PCU, CPC, etc. of that App. In order to keep up with him, she went to learn some common terms in the Internet circle. None of these terms were relevant to her work and life, but she was willing to do so. She often sees and hears many models about marrying a good man from KOLs on Weibo or Xiaohongshu. Xu Yinghe thought that Luo Jinan&#39;s life should be filled with these abbreviations, so she would be considerate and not ask him. This is also part of the model about marrying a good man - as long as the model is good, it is equivalent to having With a moat in place, the transaction is destined to succeed. She criticized the practice of cutting off fingers and arms for her boyfriend to bleed to ward off evil spirits and avoid disasters. The sacrifice of shedding a little blood is nothing at all. Only by directly giving money that is harder to obtain can reflect trust, be more precious, more powerful, can help the other party more, and gain more attention from the other party. A good lover must be a partner, strategist and investor at the same time. Therefore, she understood Eduardo&#39;s behavior of freezing the account. He just wanted to get more attention from his friend Zuckerberg. She understands, but she doesn&#39;t approve. This childish behavior became an important reason for Eduardo and Zuckerberg to part ways in the future. She is more calm than Eduardo. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;That was when Xu Yinghe was a freshman. In 2010, the movie &quot;The Social Network&quot; became a hit. Every young person around is keen to explore the reasons for Facebook&#39;s success. They are all amazed by the young founder&#39;s sense of smell, mind and ambition, and criticize the filth and betrayal behind this &quot;giant monster&quot; of the Internet that has changed the traditional social ecology. Xu Yinghe and others chatted freely with their peers about the Internet, wealth and the future on Facebook&#39;s localized product Renren. At that time, there was a popular saying on Renren: If you can’t be the founder of Facebook, then become the man or woman behind the founder of Facebook. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Only Xu Yinghe insisted on following through. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;五&lt;/p>;&lt;p>; Luo Jinan is always busy when he is with Xu Yinghe. He has more than one mobile phone, and he often never forgets to swipe on this phone and take a look at that phone when eating with Xu Yinghe. He explained to Xu Yinghe that he was conducting grayscale testing of the development program. This is the part Xu Yinghe doesn&#39;t understand. But she likes this ignorance. She would not use her own knowledge and experience to measure Luo Jinan&#39;s knowledge and experience. A person who studies economics can only see whether the App has received advertisements and started to monetize and make money. However, as long as the App is cool enough, simple enough, and the model is good enough, it will definitely be a great product and should not be limited to what is in front of you. A mere advertising fee. This is the main reason why Eduardo, who studied economics and was able to earn 300,000 US dollars by buying crude oil in one summer, was eventually eliminated. Eduardo clearly doesn&#39;t have enough imagination for social networks. Even though he studied economics. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Therefore, Xu Yinghe’s best course of action is not to ask. The &quot;Quyou&quot; App must be a good product. Other domestic social apps are too anxious to make money. The advertisements on the homepage make customers click into the shopping app involuntarily. But &quot;Quyou&quot; is a product that really focuses on young people&#39;s social interaction. Xu Yinghe swipes it every day. She believes that there must be a sufficient number of her or him who like this app, although it seems a bit lonely at the moment and it is not even ranked on the download ranking list. But among all people, especially young people, who doesn’t want the attention of others, especially the one they like? &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Who can resist the temptation of having everyone’s attention? ——Not even Zuckerberg. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Besides, Xu Yinghe did find the person on this App who really paid attention to her and told her &quot;the most important thing is yourself.&quot; &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Luo Jinan must be Xu Yinghe&#39;s correct answer, she has never been so sure. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;It&#39;s not like she didn&#39;t have a chance to check the correct answer.交往两个月后，一次短暂的郊外出游给她提供了绝佳的检查时机。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;五月初的一个周末，罗晋安提议去郊外放松。驶往郊外的路两旁是参差错落的树，掩映着南方特有的白墙黑瓦的民居。春花柳絮已经落了，大片大片的绿蓬蓬勃勃，空气里肆意横行着暮春时节软烂无情的味道。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;徐映荷坐在副驾驶位置上，蜷在薄薄的针织衫下，心里有一点点光阴易逝的&amp;ldquo;花开堪折直须折&amp;rdquo;之类的感慨。她摆弄了一下车里的挂饰，一串黄色的玉石发出泠泠的声音。罗晋安说这辆车是借朋友的。但是按照罗晋安目前的状况，一辆宝马三系应该是必须的吧，出门见投资人总要装装门面的。他为什么还要借朋友的车呢？还是辆本田思域。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;公司怎么样，还顺利吗？徐映荷问。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;还行吧，只能是但行好事莫问前程咯，罗晋安以一贯的满不在乎的口吻说，反正我爸妈已经给我买好房了，我不太着急拿这个App变现的。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;徐映荷想问他的房子在哪，又觉得直接开口问不好意思，显得有些太算计。毕竟他们俩认识也就两个月。心里算了算罗晋安来见她所花费的时间，再按照她对本城交通状况的理解，大概是在青山区。青山区是新区，房价不见得高，好在潜力还是有的。这样想着，嘴上却说，那还蛮好的，你现在挣的钱都能落自己口袋里了。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;老阿姐想啥呢，罗晋安腾出手敲了敲她的脑袋，说，我爸妈把房子买在了锦江区，怕我小小年纪不好好工作只付了房款的一半，余下的还得我自己赚，我也苦得来，新出的iPhone12都没舍得买呢。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;锦江区么，徐映荷想，那儿的房价逼近二十万了吧。正想着，罗晋安拉住了徐映荷的手。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;罗晋安的手温温的，暖暖的，徐映荷的心里像被扔了一颗石子，涟漪一圈一圈扩散开来。让她想起来&amp;ldquo;春江水暖鸭先知&amp;rdquo;这样的诗句。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;那天晚上罗晋安和徐映荷住在乡下农家乐。开房间时罗晋安主动要了两间，徐映荷有些意外。老阿姐不会是想跟我睡在一起吧，罗晋安靠在她房间的门边笑着说，你还可以再考察一下，现在的人都很会演哦，一不小心误终生可就不好了。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;滚回去睡觉吧，徐映荷推了罗晋安一把，拉上门，转身进了自己的房间。躺在床上时，徐映荷的心砰砰砰直跳。其实她已经做好了今晚两个人睡在一起的准备，甚至今晚算是她对罗晋安进行的一个考验，他要是不做安全措施，他就被PASS，他要是不碰她，他就能得六十分，至于为什么不是一百分而是六十分，徐映荷想到这个问题时脸烫烫的。这大概是恋爱的感觉。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;睡前，徐映荷还接到了罗晋安通过&amp;ldquo;趣友&amp;rdquo;App发来的信息。不要想我哦，罗晋安说，我可是很古典的美男子一枚，我们以后的日子还长呢。还有，我很珍视你。晚安。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;徐映荷抱着这条信息进入梦乡。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;六&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;微博上的某个情感大V说过，恋爱进行到三分熟就上床的人喜欢新鲜，有热度，但其实内里还是生的，七分熟就上床的人渴望看到不一样的风景但向往稳定，而十分熟才上床的人，安然于世，是真正的爱人。徐映荷觉得她和罗晋安就走在十分熟的路上，虽然他们交往不到半年。但这正是徐映荷欢喜的样子。她从未跟任何一个人十分熟过，不管是母亲还是朋友。时间久了，徐映荷也不记得被全心全意的爱包裹着是什么感觉了。大概就像有一株植物在心底里生了根，枝桠慢慢向上，根牢牢地向下，在风里雨里春风里变高变壮，心里面自然也欣欣然了起来。说起来，快半年了，因为罗晋安太忙，徐映荷还从未有时间跟他好好吵个架。每次意见分歧的时候，罗晋安都会双手投降，说，你对你对，老婆最大。这种相处方式对从小目睹了父母吵架场景的徐映荷来讲简直称心如意。她和罗晋安的恋爱过程堪称一帆风顺，根本不用做加法或减法，那些痴缠的喜欢却不得、有关年龄的顾虑、错综复杂的家庭关系、收入等等曾经困扰她的东西，遇到罗晋安之后统统都不存在了，恋爱就只是恋爱，往后的路也不再是征程，而是两人携手要走的康庄大道。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;徐映荷前天又给罗晋安打了一笔钱，罗晋安最近又看上了一支基金，还给她看了收益率。这笔钱不止动用了她工作五年后的所有积蓄。罗晋安昨天约她见面，送了她一条施华洛世奇的黑天鹅项链。她很喜欢，这是罗晋安在两人交往的第六个月后送给她的第一个正式礼物。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;公司的产品有投资人感兴趣，正在接触，罗晋安在抱着她时说。清冷的月光照在她和他身上，似乎给他们注入了奇异的力量。徐映荷甚至有些激狂，她的指甲掐进了罗晋安的背，颤抖地说：&amp;ldquo;你是中国的扎克伯格，我是普拉西亚&amp;middot;陈！我就要见证一个中国的Facebook产生了对不对！ &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;对！我就要有钱了！ &amp;rdquo;在高潮到来之时，罗晋安声音喑哑，充满诱人的厚实感。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;徐映荷非常满足。 &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;对生活满足的徐映荷变得宽容，完全不觉得正在进行的公司例会难熬。纵然一通显示座机号码的电话正锲而不舍地打进来，手机震了又震，部门经理凛冽的眼神不断飘向徐映荷。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;例会结束后，电话倒又不响了。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;随着这通电话一起不响的，还有罗晋安。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;从那天起，罗晋安就像一滴水掉进了大海里，徐映荷上穷碧落下黄泉，两处茫茫皆不见。第二天、第三天、第四天，徐映荷这才发现她并不清楚罗晋安的朋友家人等社会关系，甚至不清楚他在公司里的具体职位。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;第五天早晨，徐映荷又接到一通陌生的座机电话。想到可能是罗晋安，怕他有什么事，又怕他真出了什么事。熬到经理讲话结束，电话轰炸也停下来了。徐映荷上&amp;ldquo;趣友&amp;rdquo;App上看了看，页面依然显示无法加载，心里的疑云聚集了起来。她静了静，给罗晋安打电话，依然显示关机。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;像要奔赴战场似的，徐映荷义无反顾地按了那个反复打过来的电话。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;七&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;这样的事每天都有发生，你接下来还要好好生活，这个人&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;App也只有一个空壳子，是个程序员就能做好的&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;跟你一样遭遇的女孩子很多，这次就有五个是被同一个人&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;我们尽量帮你追回&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;一个听上去客观且确切的声音从电话中传来。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;徐映荷早已习得了一类视而不见的本能。或者再简单一点，对于生活中诸多不顺利的打卡来过，她早已视之为当然。徐映荷在银行App里点了信用卡分期那一栏。给罗晋安的那笔钱里，有一部分是她委托母亲用咖啡店里的POS机刷出来的，现在她得分期还款。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;在&amp;ldquo;积分分期惠&amp;rdquo;这一栏里，徐映荷看到了那条施华洛世奇的黑天鹅项链，只要信用卡二十万积分就可以兑换，还挺实惠的。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>;&lt;/p>;
