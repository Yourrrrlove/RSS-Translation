She has a youthful face, but her whole face is swollen from crying. Click on the video to see that it contains several interviews and personal monologues, but each protagonist seems to be &quot;unlovable&quot;. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Generally speaking, pressure is divided into two categories, one is external pressure and the other is internal pressure. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Let’s talk about external pressure first. &lt;strong>;The so-called external pressure is just like when we dive. When we dive to the bottom of the sea, we need to bring oxygen bottles. The water pressure will make our ears uncomfortable. This is the most significant environmental pressure. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;External pressure is divided into several types, one is survival pressure, the other is social relationship pressure, and the third is family pressure. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;1. Survival Pressure&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Contemporary society focuses on a &quot;sense of anxiety&quot;, you are not anxious , you are too embarrassed to go out. Where does this anxiety come from? The truth is that everyone doesn’t know how they should settle down and live their lives. &lt;strong>;The increasingly severe economic situation forces every young person to face his own life. Without the &quot;wings&quot; of his parents, what should he do to support himself? It has become the first consideration for every young person. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Jobs are hard to find, and once you find a job you are so busy that you are physically and mentally exhausted.&quot; This contradiction makes young people feel confused every day that &quot;going to work is like visiting a grave.&quot; Furthermore, it is actually difficult for young people who have grown up in a new cultural context to accept that they are completely &quot;tooled&quot; at work, which is something that the older generation of &quot;screws&quot; cannot understand. . &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The strong work pressure makes young people forget the meaning and value of their existence, but they have no money if they don’t work. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;2. Social relationship pressure&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Personality tests are very popular recently, and people often mention &quot;I&quot; people and &quot;E&quot; people. The so-called I person is an introverted person, and the so-called E person is a sociable person, a social madman. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I don’t know if it’s a sample difference, but I feel like I and my friends around me are mostly I people, with very few people who like to socialize wildly. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;In the workplace, it is inevitable to exchange glasses with customers. In order to expand your social circle and gain some resources, you are forced to meet all kinds of unfamiliar people. This is for most people who have grown up in the Internet age. From a social perspective, it is extremely unfriendly. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;3. Family Pressure&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Forced marriage&amp;rdquo; is still a big problem nowadays,&lt;strong>; No matter how advanced the times are, the ideas of parents will always be separated from the ideas of young people. &lt;/strong>;Even if you feel that your thinking is extremely advanced and you have evolved to be completely independent, your parents still feel that you must get on the &quot;right track&quot; of getting married and having children as soon as possible. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;And this kind of pressure is all-round and exists 24 hours a day. As long as you don&#39;t get married or have children for a day, the spittle of your parents, relatives and friends will come. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;In this state, one can imagine how much pressure contemporary young people are under. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;After talking about external pressure, let’s talk about internal pressure. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Today’s social media is too developed, and we can often see the living conditions of people who are completely different from ourselves, which makes people extremely anxious just opening Xiaohongshu or Weibo. Every time I use these apps, I think, why are others so good? Either you make millions a year, or you travel around the world, what about yourself? &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Even if my current life is happy and peaceful, once I fall into social networks and see other people’s dynamics and lifestyles, I feel twice as stressed. I am also keen on fantasy. Through a few pictures and videos, I imagine that others live a free and comfortable life. Looking back on myself, it seems that I am not as good as others in any way. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;In the East Asian context, most people seem to have a &quot;sense of exploitation&quot; of themselves, that is, they dare not be happy. When they are happy or relaxed, they feel guilty. This is also a source of internally generated stress. &lt;/strong>;Because you can never relax, you always have to find something to do. If you don’t do it well, the stress will come back like a tsunami. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;External pressure is not easy to solve. It requires us to spend a long time facing it and coexisting with it. But precisely because external pressure is so great, young people should reduce internal friction. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Inexplicably, I remembered that sentence again - &quot;Besides life and death, everything is a scratch.&quot; &amp;rdquo;&lt;strong>;When you are stressed, you might as well let yourself go and take a break. Only after you have rested can you face the cruel reality and life again. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;/p>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;Editor in charge: Zhou Ziheng onewenti@wufazhuce.com&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Please see @ONE Studio’s pinned Weibo for information on the call for papers.

Scientist Lin Yuanyin plans to solve this problem himself. As his research deepened, he discovered that once people live in their own world, time begins to fly. Aging becomes a matter of time. Only waiting can slow down time. &lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;1.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The people imprisoned here together with Lin Yuanyin all have special skills. Experts in prose, calligraphy, philosophy, and painting, there are a lot of them. And he is the only scientist in this building. People here all have their own areas of specialization and never dare to neglect their time. It seems that once they lose their ability and enthusiasm, their lives will fall to the bottom and they will be thrown into jail. Lin Yuanyin firmly believed that some mysterious forces had concentrated the smart brains of their generation in this suburban building. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The conditions for food, clothing and housing are acceptable, but travel is restricted. &amp;ldquo;There must be some conspiracy! &quot;It&#39;s not that he hasn&#39;t thought about escaping, but the place is heavily guarded. Even if he avoids the surveillance inside the building, it&#39;s impossible to bypass the security guard at the door.&quot; What&#39;s more, his aging knees can no longer support him walking very far. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Yesterday was the Double Ninth Festival, and it also coincided with the seventieth birthday of the philosopher Li Quanming. He lives in speculation all day long, and looks much older than his actual age. The birthday banquet coincided with the festival, so it was naturally held in a lively manner. Local leaders even came to express their condolences. The accompanying reporters brought more cameras than the surveillance cameras in the building. That was a good opportunity to escape, but unfortunately Lin Yuanyin was too sleepy and fell asleep after lunch, missing the grand dinner. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I just woke up this morning and heard someone say that the food last night was so rich that it would be unimaginable unless you saw it with your own eyes. The tables and stools in the restaurant were combined into a 20-meter-long banquet. , covered with a white tablecloth, except tobacco and wine, chicken, duck and fish, everything is available. As night fell, fireworks were set off outside, making it as lively as the Chinese New Year. Lin Yuanyin sat in a wheelchair and listened to the discussions in the corridor without taking it seriously. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;At this time, Li Quanming came over with a nonchalant expression and pushed him from the room to the open space outside the building. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Lin Yuanyin turned around and said: &quot;They are happy for you!&quot; &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;The smaller and more closed a place is, the more people inside like to celebrate festivals! Li Quanming pushed up the reading glasses on the bridge of his nose and continued: &quot;They are not celebrating for me, but for themselves. The essence of celebration is an escape, an escape from daily life.&quot; &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;In the eyes of 75-year-old Lin Yuanyin, this birthday boy who has just turned 70 is still too young. He always likes to make remarks and not speak human words! &quot;Then you...&quot; What Lin Yuanyin wants to say is--you should have taken advantage of the chaos last night to tell the leaders or reporters who came to express condolences the truth about our house arrest here, but not far away Li Baoling, the staff member, was staring at him eagerly. &quot;Don&#39;t you want to go out?&quot; &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Why do you want to go out? &amp;rdquo;Li Quanming took off his glasses and rubbed them on his clothes. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Freedom! Lin Yuanyin said. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;If your heart is not free, you will not be free anywhere! ” Essayist Zhou Qingsong shook his folding fan and slowly approached. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;He is only sixty-eight years old, energetic, and does not look like someone of the same age as them. The old philosopher seemed to dislike guys younger than him. He took a few steps and said, &quot;Actually, most people don&#39;t want freedom, but a cage with better conditions. It doesn&#39;t have to be too good, as long as it&#39;s better than the previous one.&quot; The cage just needs to be a little better! ” Li Quanming put on his glasses again and his eyes became sharp. &quot;The process from one cage to another is people&#39;s entire pursuit of freedom!&quot; &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Zhou Qingsong’s eyes gleamed as he listened, but his hands pretended to be disdainful as he fiddled with the folding fan. But Lin Yuanyin knew that it wouldn&#39;t be long before this guy would write this passage into his article, and then on a sunny afternoon, he would tell it as his life insights to the elderly female scholar in the building. He vaguely remembered that Zhou Qingsong also copied a few sentences from him. To be more precise, it should be a poem. As for the content of the poem, he could not remember clearly. But every time Zhou Qingsong shook his head and chanted, his heart would feel stabbing. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Lin Yuanyin closed his eyes, feeling the pleasant breeze blowing on his cheeks while savoring the conversation that just happened. &quot;If your heart is not free, you will not be free anywhere!&quot; Lin Yuanyin pondered for a moment and made a decision. Putting aside the conspiracy that they were imprisoned here, as a scientist, the first thing he has to solve is his own subject-the truth about the acceleration of time. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;He waved in the air, and Li Baoling walked up to him like a guard and pushed him back into the room. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;2.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Here, everyone has their own exclusive room. The size of the rooms and facilities are different. Lin Yuanyin&#39;s room is large, with a bed, bathroom, balcony, and even a desk! Zhou Qingsong&#39;s room was very small, with only a bed. If he really wanted to write something, he could only use the small table at the end of the bed. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;At first he thought that the rooms were allocated according to age, with older people living in the older rooms and younger people living in the younger rooms. But not long ago, Li Quanming, who was younger than him, moved to a room that was larger than him. Therefore, he had a vague suspicion that rooms were allocated according to ability, and whoever contributed more would live in a big room. Thinking of this, he was somewhat proud. After all, his room was considered to be above average. &quot;The greater the ability, the bigger the room. Is it possible that we are locked here to steal our research results?&quot; &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Lin Yuanyin was startled by his guess. Then remind yourself that you must never leave a few words or half a formula on any piece of paper. All deductions must be made in the mind. Fortunately, their brains are still free. Freedom of the brain is true freedom. Lin Yuanyin is very satisfied with his transformation of Zhou Qingsong&#39;s original sentence. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;As soon as the afternoon sun slanted into the room, Xiao Ruan walked in. She is thin, small, and in her early twenties. She is the youngest staff member in the building and the only person Lin Yuanyin trusts here. &quot;Don&#39;t you think that the time in a day has become shorter, and it is getting shorter day by day!&quot; Lin Yuanyin said while looking at the balcony. Xiao Ruan didn&#39;t answer. He opened the sliding door of the balcony in a routine manner, and then gently pushed him in the wheelchair into the balcony. The October setting sun shone on my face, and I couldn&#39;t feel any warmth at all. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Suddenly, Lin Yuanyin&#39;s shoulders tightened, as if someone had taken something away from there. He turned back suddenly and took off Xiao Ruan&#39;s hand - it was a white hair. &amp;ldquo;Time is really getting faster and faster! ” He pinched his white hair and twisted it a few times in the sunset. His hands trembled uncontrollably. A breeze blew and the silver threads suddenly flew away. He slowly narrowed his eyes, as if he had realized another truth about time. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;The acceleration of time is explained by scientists as an illusion. For example, in the eyes of an eight-year-old child, eight years is the whole meaning of life, while in the eyes of an eighty-year-old man, eight years is only one-tenth of his life. &quot;Lin Yuanyin&#39;s words sounded powerful, but they were spoken very slowly, as if the content was being expressed in the process of expression. &quot;Therefore, the longer a person lives, the faster time passes. Do you think this is true?&quot; &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Xiao Ruan raised his hand and looked at the beating second hand on the dial, but did not answer. Lin Yuanyin continued: &quot;Some people say that when a person feels that time is flying by, it means that he is old.&quot; Time always passes slowly for children. It’s because when a child first comes to the world, everything he sees is something he has never seen before, and what an adult sees is something he has seen before. The brain will automatically delete duplicate parts, so the time for adults appears to be faster. Do you agree with this? An argument? &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Xiao Ruan smiled softly and said, &quot;I don&#39;t understand scientific matters. I only know that the sun is going down again. It&#39;s time for you to go back to your room and rest!&quot; &amp;rdquo;After saying that, he slowly turned the wheelchair around, pushed it back to the room, and then slammed the sliding door of the balcony shut tightly. At this moment, Lin Yuanyin suddenly felt that this place had become the prison in Li Quanming&#39;s mouth. And the short balcony break is just a break in the air once a day. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Lin Yuanyin still didn&#39;t stop thinking when he returned to the cage. &quot;But I don&#39;t agree with this argument. As a scientist, I have an obligation to follow my conscience and express my feelings honestly!&quot; When I was very young, I always had this feeling-when I encountered something new and interesting, time would go very quickly, but when I encountered something repetitive and boring, , time will become very slow, even to an unbearable level! The older a person gets, the more repetitions he encounters, so he should feel that time is getting slower and slower. It cannot be the other way around, unless - time is indeed accelerating. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Xiao Ruan poured a cup of hot water and handed it over: &quot;Congratulations, Mr. Lin, you finally found evidence that time accelerates!&quot; Lin Yuanyin refused to compliment and pushed away the glass filled with hot water, and continued: &quot;But I still can&#39;t understand why today&#39;s most cutting-edge scientists haven&#39;t discovered this fact yet!&quot; &amp;rdquo;He pursed his dry lips proudly. &quot;According to my calculations, there are less than twenty hours in a day now!&quot; &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Xiao Ruan put the glass on the bedside table and persuaded in a low voice: &quot;You have already retired. These questions should be left to your students!&quot; &amp;rdquo;Student! Lin Yuanyin slapped his thigh: &quot;What a great idea!&quot; Please help me call Dafu and have him come over tonight. I must complete this project with him! &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Today is too late! &quot;Xiao Ruan paused and continued: &quot;Perhaps, you can tell me the content and I will convey it to you! &quot;Lin Yuanyin was immediately alert. Could it be that Xiao Ruan also wanted to steal my research results?&quot; &quot;Don&#39;t blame me for being harsh. You overestimate yourself. No one understands my theory except him!&quot; &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Xiao Ruan nodded, with no trace of disappointment on his face. &quot;Okay, I&#39;ll contact you. Sister Baoling will come over to feed you medicine in a while. You can&#39;t secretly spit out the medicine like before!&quot; Lin Yuanyin nodded vaguely and watched Xiao Ruan leave. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Li Baoling is the fattest staff member here and the person Lin Yuanyin dislikes the most. The disgust was not because she was fat, but because of her lazy face. Lin Yuanyin had never judged people by their appearance in her life, she just hated fools. He believes that there are no fools in the world, only those who steal too much will become fools! &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Just as she was thinking about it, Li Baoling walked in with her belly swaying: &quot;Old scientist, it&#39;s time to take medicine!&quot; As soon as he got closer, Lin Yuanyin smelled the smell of sweat, then wrinkled his nose and said, &quot;Give me the medicine, and I&#39;ll take it myself!&quot; ” Li Baoling handed over the pills with an indifferent expression. As soon as Lin Yuanyin took it, his hands began to shake. After a few clicks, the pills rolled off the bed! &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;What’s wrong with you! Li Baoling, with bulging eyes, bent down to pick up the pills. &amp;ldquo;Do you know how difficult it is to get this medicine? ” After saying that, he forced the lost pills into Lin Yuanyin’s mouth, and the flesh on his face shook up and down. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Lin Yuanyin refused to obey, and whined loudly from his mouth. The pills are pushed back and forth between the tongue and fingers, like a time bomb that no one wants to take over! After a few seconds of stalemate, Li Baoling retracted her hand, wiped the saliva from her fingertips on her body, and changed her face. &quot;Mr. Lin, please be obedient. This is not an ordinary medicine. It is a newly developed wisdom tablet. Taking it will help you think.&quot; &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Lin Yuanyin exhaled from his nostrils, but raised the corners of his mouth slightly. &quot;I&#39;ve known it for a long time. You gave me this medicine just to speed up my research progress and steal my research results!&quot; But even if I eat it, I won’t reveal a word to you! ” He reached for the water glass on the bedside table. As soon as he could hold it firmly, his hand began to tremble again. A few seconds later, the glass shattered to the ground with a bang. &amp;ldquo;You old thing! ” Li Baoling’s eyes were so wide that they seemed to fall out. Lin Yuanyin lowered his head and muttered: &quot;I used to only use white porcelain cups with handles for easy handling.&quot; &amp;rdquo;It seems that this time, he really didn&#39;t mean it. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;What’s wrong! &amp;rdquo;Xiao Ruan heard the sound and came over. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;I refuse to take medicine again! ” Li Baoling had a complaining expression. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Let me do it! &quot;Xiao Ruan took the wet pill in Li Baoling&#39;s hand and said, &quot;Change one! &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Li Baoling rolled her eyes at Lin Yuanyin. &quot;Whether you like it or not, that&#39;s the amount per person per day.&quot; &amp;rdquo;After saying that, he walked out of the room shaking his butt. Xiao Ruan frowned, rubbed the pills in his hands, broke them in half, and fed them to Lin Yuanyin&#39;s lips, then he remembered the broken water glass on the ground. &quot;Wait a minute, I&#39;ll get another cup.&quot; ” But Lin Yuanyin stuck out his tongue, rolled the pill into his mouth like a treasure hunt, and swallowed it with difficulty. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Seeing this, Xiao Ruan had to help him get on the bed first, and then sweep up the broken glass on the floor. When she was about to leave, Lin Yuanyin&#39;s rough snoring came from the bed. She gently exited the door, turned around and bumped into Li Baoling in the corridor. &amp;ldquo;Have you finished eating? ” Xiao Ruan nodded, took Li Baoling’s fleshy arm and walked out. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;3.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Recently, Mr. Lin doesn’t seem to get up at night very much! &amp;rdquo;Xiao Ruan said. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;It’s best if you don’t wake up all night, otherwise you’ll have to wait for him if you get bumped! &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Xiao Ruan hit Li Baoling&#39;s waist with his elbow: &quot;Keep your voice down!&quot; &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;I’m not afraid of him, I’m just afraid that he’ll catch me talking about scientific theories! I would rather listen to Mr. Zhou reciting poems than listen to him talking about these nonsense! &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;I think what he said is quite interesting! &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;If you like to listen, just don’t give him medicine tomorrow! &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;How can I not take it? I have to take antihypertensive medicine every day! &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Li Baoling pursed her lips and became mute. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Xiao Ruan felt something was wrong and his eyelids tightened: &quot;What did you give him to eat!&quot; &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Hey, hey, you’re the one feeding me today! ” Li Baoling shook off Xiao Ruan’s arm. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Sleeping pills? &quot;After Xiao Ruan finished speaking, he glanced diagonally upward. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Li Baoling glanced at the corridor and pulled Xiao Ruan to the corner. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Now, for your mother’s sake, I introduced you to work here. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;As soon as he heard this, Xiao Ruan instantly became half shorter. Based on seniority, she still has to call her aunt. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Li Baoling put her arm around Xiao Ruan again: &quot;Don&#39;t worry, the surveillance here is all for show.&quot; &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Xiao Ruan shook his body, as if to put aside this scandal. Li Baoling immediately raised her eyebrows and said coldly: &quot;Don&#39;t be a crow in the coal pile and don&#39;t see yourself as a bad person. You are so caring, why don&#39;t you become a volunteer!&quot; &quot;Xiao Ruan looked at Li Baoling as if he were a stranger, and said, &quot;Aren&#39;t you afraid that the family will sue you if they find out? &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Hey, as long as no one is killed, who do you think really cares? Besides, at this age, who doesn’t have something wrong with them. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Seeing that Xiao Ruan remained silent, Li Baoling continued: &quot;Birth, old age, sickness and death, birth, old age, sickness and death. Aging is a precursor to illness. Illness is the process of aging. Aging is illness. Haven&#39;t you heard anyone say that a person gets sick alone?&quot; After a while, he is no longer a patient. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;What is that? &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;It’s trouble. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Xiao Ruan took a breath of cold air. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;This is even more true when you get older. &amp;rdquo;After saying that, Li Baoling strode away as if leaving the trouble behind. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;That night, Xiao Ruan called Dafu’s phone number. Ask him to make time to come tomorrow. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The other end of the phone asked: &quot;It&#39;s not time to pay yet.&quot; &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Xiao Ruan said: &amp;ldquo;No, there is still half a year. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;That’s good. After hanging up the phone, Xiao Ruan rubbed the hand that gave Mr. Lin the medicine, &quot;It seems he is right, his time does fly faster than before!&quot; ” But at this moment, Xiao Ruan prayed that Lin Yuanyin’s “time acceleration theory” was true so that Dafu could arrive as soon as possible. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;4.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;When Dafu arrived, it was noon the next day, and Lin Yuanyin had not yet woken up. Xiao Ruan placed the new water cup on Lin Yuanyin&#39;s bedside and pulled Dafu aside. Just as he was about to say something, Li Baoling was outside the corridor, striding back and forth. The steps were heavy and loud. The first step is like beating a drum, and the next step is like swinging a heavy hammer. After a few blows, even Lin Yuanyin was shaken up. He wrinkled his face and rubbed his eyes. When Xiao Ruan saw this, he immediately raised the pillow behind him into a backrest. &quot;Quick, get your notebook ready, I&#39;ve made a big discovery!&quot; &quot;Lin Yuanyin&#39;s voice was hoarse, and he had not yet completely escaped from sleepiness. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Xiao Ruan walked to the table in three steps and two steps. Lin Yuanyin raised his chin and said sternly: &quot;Let him take it, you are not my student, don&#39;t touch my things!&quot; After saying that, he turned to Dafu and said, &quot;The notebook is in the drawer!&quot; ” Dafu smiled apologetically at Xiao Ruan and walked to the desk. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Whenever Dafu comes, Xiao Ruan immediately loses Lin Yuanyin&#39;s trust. Especially when he&#39;s about to explain the mystery of time. It seems that except for Dafu, everyone around him is an undercover agent, trying to steal his research results. Xiao Ruan rubbed his hands and backed out of the door. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Li Baoling glanced at her in the corridor: &quot;What, have you fallen out of favor?&quot; ” After saying that, Xiao Ruan turned around and left without waiting for the answer, as if he was standing guard at the door just to sound the alarm for her. Little Ruan said nothing, quietly looking in through the square window on the door, waiting for the moment when Lin Yuanyin needed him. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Dafu opened the drawer, and a yellowed physics textbook lay on the top floor. His nose twitched, he dug out the black leather notebook at the bottom, pulled out a chair, and sat down next to Lin Yuanyin&#39;s bed. Although the cover of the notebook is thick, the paper inside is very thin. Once opened, the middle seam is full of traces of artificial tearing. He crossed his legs, put the notebook on his knees, and stared at the pen in his hand intently, like a good student who listened carefully. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Listen to me, I have unlocked the truth about time! Dafu raised his head sleepily, but Lin Yuanyin looked serious. &amp;ldquo;Stop being so stupid, be smarter. Remember what I told you before? Time is accelerating! If my calculation is correct, then a day now is equivalent to half a day in the past, that is to say, there are less than twelve hours in a day! &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Last time you said it was less than twenty hours! &quot;After Dafu finished speaking, Lin Yuanyin was stunned for a second. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Don’t interrupt, time is always accelerating! After saying that, he stared at the white paper in Dafu&#39;s hand and coughed dryly. Dafu immediately understood and started recording. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;quot;The earth&#39;s rotation is getting faster and faster. The sun rises and sets like an accelerating pendulum. The four seasons of the year are no longer clear. I believe you can feel this. Spring has not started yet. It’s summer because of the sun, and autumn is so short that people don’t have time to appreciate the maple leaves! ” At this point, Lin Yuanyin felt that she was more suitable to be an essayist than Zhou Qingsong, and she giggled with satisfaction. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;But a rapid ringtone interrupted Lin Yuanyin&#39;s pride. Dafu stopped writing, took out his cell phone, and pressed mute. When he raised his head again, Lin Yuanyin&#39;s eyes were full of sternness, as if staring at a poor student who had deserted in class. Dafu hurriedly continued the topic: &quot;Actually, it is not difficult to prove this. Just hold your watch and match the time of sunrise and sunset. It will be clear.&quot; &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Naive! Lin Yuanyin came back to his senses, &quot;This is the key part of what I want to tell you. All time-related tools in the world have long been adjusted to their speed. This is why everyone feels that there is not enough time.&quot; Use it, but can’t find any evidence! Lin Yuanyin coughed again and signaled Dafu to remember it quickly. &quot;The real problem is not the acceleration of time, but the fact that even I have discovered the acceleration of time. Why haven&#39;t the most cutting-edge scientists discovered it? There is only one reason!&quot; That means someone is deliberately trying to cover up the truth! &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Why? ” Dafu raised his head, but his eyelids were lowered, showing no trace of curiosity. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Because human life span is shortening! Don&#39;t object in a hurry. I know you want to say that life span has been steadily increasing since humans entered civilized society, but don&#39;t forget that time is accelerating. In other words, it’s not that people are living longer, but that one year has become shorter. If time returns to the size it was a thousand years ago, you will find that modern people can only live up to forty years old, and may even Live shorter than ancient people! This is the truth! Human life is getting shorter and shorter, and the number of births has been declining year after year. What they want to cover up is actually the fact that human beings are about to die! &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Dafu scratched his head, closed the notebook, and followed the words. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Shouldn’t we announce the truth and study together a plan to combat time acceleration? &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Do you know how much panic that would create? This is not the death of an individual, but the death of an entire species. The level of despair is far beyond our imagination, not to mention that even I can’t think of any better plan! &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Even if there is no plan, announcing the truth can at least make people live in the present! &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;It’s easy to say, can you live in the present? &quot;At this moment, Dafu&#39;s cell phone rang again. Lin Yuanyin stared at the phone fiercely. Until the ringing was cut off by Dafu, he continued to preach: &quot;No one can live in the present, we can only live in the opposite. In the hope of the future, we are born in hope, parasitic in hope, and even reborn in hope. If hope is gone, life will come to an end. This is the difference between humans and other low-IQ species! &amp;rdquo;Even between humans and animals, Lin Yuanyin habitually uses IQ to differentiate. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Hurry up and hide this content and publish it for me! Lin Yuanyin said. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;That’s okay, I’ll leave first! &amp;rdquo;Dafu stood up. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Wait, let me check again! ” Lin Yuanyin looked at the research results in Dafu’s hands. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;That’s not necessary! ” Dafu quickly closed the notebook. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Lin Yuanyin became suspicious: &quot;Of course!&quot; After saying that, he straightened up and said, &quot;Give it to me quickly, or I will call other students to help me complete my research!&quot; &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Except for me, no other students will come to see you! teacher LIN! Dafu said the word &quot;teacher&quot; with gritted teeth. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Lin Yuanyin&#39;s eyes were bloodshot. When Dafu was not paying attention, he stretched out his hand and pulled the notebook back into his hand. Then he roared like thunder: &quot;What&#39;s going on!&quot; &amp;rdquo;The volume seemed to be angry at the students in the entire classroom! He flipped through the notebook in his hand repeatedly, but there was not a single word in it except meaningless lines. Every upward line is like a bad smile, mocking Lin Yuanyin&#39;s great research. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;How could you fool me like this? Time is accelerating, time is disappearing, time is almost gone! Lin Yuanyin said as he roughly tore off the paper full of lines. It seems that it is not a note but a calendar, destined to become thinner and thinner from the first day of use. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;I really don’t have time today, let’s do it next time, I will listen to you carefully next time! Dafu took two steps back and added, &quot;Okay?&quot; dad. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;As soon as he heard this, Lin Yuanyin was dumbfounded and stared blankly at the messy lines in his hands. The lines blurred into threads in his tears, as if the rapid flow of time tightened his grip instantly. life. He felt that his brain was not enough and he was in urgent need of a wisdom tablet. He reached out and groped on the bedside, and there was a thump, and the glass fell to the floor. Xiao Ruan immediately pushed the door open and entered. &quot;You can&#39;t treat him like this. If even family members treat him like this, then who in the nursing home will take good care of your dad!&quot; &quot;After Xiao Ruan finished speaking, Lin Yuanyin&#39;s face lost all its strength. Instantly, he looked old and lost his appearance. Only one mouth remained, still trying to maintain his self-esteem. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Get out, get out of here! &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;5.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;At this time, the ringtone rang again like an ultimatum. Dafu took a breath and answered the phone. The roar in the receiver was no less angry than Lin Yuanyin&#39;s. Dafu held the receiver and apologized humbly, promising to work overtime tonight to complete the work. As he spoke, he moved out the door. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Xiao Ruan lowered his head and pretended not to hear. After sweeping up the debris on the floor, he chased out the door with a dustpan. He was stopped by Li Baoling before he took two steps. &quot;I have seen many such family members. When they send the old man here, they have one face, and then they come back with another face.&quot; As time goes by, the frequency of visits becomes less and less, and the intervals between visits become longer and longer. ” Her voice was so loud that she didn’t care about being heard by Dafu. Xiao Ruan pushed the dustpan into Li Baoling&#39;s hand and caught up with Dafu. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Do you know why he wants to prove that time is accelerating? &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Dafu rubbed his neck and shook his head. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;A few years ago, you took your son to see him. He asked you when you could take him home. You didn&#39;t answer, but your son said that when grandpa is one hundred years old, he will be an adult and can marry a wife. Then he will take grandpa home to attend his wedding. &quot;After Xiao Ruan finished speaking, he looked forward to catching a trace of emotion on Dafu&#39;s face. &amp;ldquo;I think he might be doing it for this. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;But Dafu turned around and took out a pack of cigarettes. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;I really don’t have time today! Next time, I&#39;ll come earlier. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Next time, always next time! &amp;rdquo;Xiao Ruan pointed deep into the corridor. &quot;Is he your father?&quot; &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Dafu took a deep breath. &quot;Yes, but he is not the only one in my life.&quot; After saying that, he took out a cigarette and just as he was about to light it, Xiao Ruan reached out and made a cross. Dafu shrugged and looked at Xiao Ruan, who looked just. &amp;ldquo;Then let me ask you, why are you here? To make money, right.我不来这儿，也是为了挣钱，我不挣钱，这里的费用谁出？ &amp;rdquo;小阮愣在一旁，仿佛年轻的正义在古老的现实面前，不堪一击。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;大福拿起手机，拨了个电话。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;今天你去学校，接儿子放学吧&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;刚说完，电话那头就传来抱怨的女声，仿佛是天降麻烦。大福抢话道：&amp;ldquo;今晚我得加班。 &amp;rdquo;女声变得尖锐，他把电话拿远，直到对方主动挂断，才长舒了一口气，冲小阮晃了晃手机，解释道：&amp;ldquo;我妻子，最近业绩考核，压力大。 &amp;rdquo;小阮象征性地点点头。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;你还没成家吧！ &amp;rdquo;大福问。见小阮低头不语，又苦笑了一声：&amp;ldquo;所以你不懂。 &amp;rdquo;他仰起头，松了松肩颈，往楼外的空地走去。空地上的老人们，写字的，画画的，各凭本事，消磨时间，忙得不亦乐乎。小阮紧随其后，开了口：&amp;ldquo;别的，我不懂，我只知道，你来得越勤，林老先生就越开心。他的日子也就好过一点。 &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;你说的，都对！ &amp;rdquo;刚说完手机又响了，&amp;ldquo;但活着真累！ &amp;rdquo;这一回，他不接，也不掐，任由铃声在胸前口袋里催命，大福望着消闲的老人们，像是望向了一片可遇而不可求的美好。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;此时，周青松摇着折扇，走到一位老太太跟前，大声朗诵着诗歌。大福只听了一耳朵，就眉心紧蹙，鼻翼在那首诗的分行里急促地翕动。直到铃声平息，他才掏出手机，看了看时间，说道：&amp;ldquo;我给你讲个故事吧......&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;那个故事在往后的日子里，一遍遍在小阮的心里翻涌。几个月后她才知道，周青松嘴里的诗句，正是出自那个故事。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;但在当时，小阮一心只想将安眠药的事情告诉大福。可一旦说了，她和李宝玲的关系就会彻底完蛋，搞不好自己也会丢掉工作。就在她犹豫之时，大福又接起了电话：&amp;ldquo;不用分期了，这个月，能按时还款！ &amp;rdquo;他边说，边快步走出了养老院。那几步在小阮眼里像逃，好似要从一个麻烦，逃进另一个麻烦里。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;6.&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;几个月后的一天下午，李泉鸣的屋里来了客人&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;是他的儿子，儿媳，还有小孙女。院里的工作人员，对他热情得出奇，甚至将他调到了林远音的对门，那是楼里面积最大，格局最好的房间。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;林远音终于明白，房间的大小，不是看能力，而是看他有没有客人。来的客人越多，房间越大，客人来的越勤，待遇越好。今天李泉鸣的嘴里没有一句拿腔拿调的哲学思辨，全是俗不可耐的人话。 &amp;ldquo;吃了吗？在忙啥？是啊，爷爷又变矮了，你又长高了！ &amp;rdquo;声音大得生怕养老院里的其他人听不见。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;但坐在办公桌前的林远音毫不嫉妒，他还有更重要的事情要做。他摸着那本皱皱巴巴的物理教材，扭头宣布：&amp;ldquo;我知道了时间的真相！ &amp;rdquo;这回帮他记录研究成果的学生，不是大福，而是小阮。林远音继续反复描述着时间加速的真相。小阮闷下头，一边写，一边想起了大福跟他讲的那个故事。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;很久以前，有个立志要当诗人的语文老师。投稿半辈子，统统石沉大海。他白天教书，夜里写诗，写完了就念给妻子听。可妻子患有中耳炎，生下儿子后，耳朵更不灵光了。后来他把自己的诗，念给学生们听，鼓励他们多读多写。课后还会把一些学生叫来办公室，摁进自己的椅子里教他们改稿。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;说来也怪，在那张椅子上坐过的学生，不少都在少年刊物上发表了文章，有的甚至拿了奖。这叫他更憋闷了。如果文学是一场比赛，那他这辈子注定是个当教练的命，于是他痛下决心要培养儿子，完成他未遂的梦想。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;如果你是他的儿子，你会怎么想？当你偏爱物理天文，又对文学毫无兴趣。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;你时常听到，其他老师们的风凉话。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;也让你儿子来办公室坐坐嘛，坐过你那椅子的学生都得了奖！ &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;诶，你们懂什么，人家是举贤避亲，高风亮节！ &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;要我说，他儿子肯定也得了奖，什么奖？当然是不要意思奖（讲）嘛。 &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;你就在这样的玩笑中，等待着自己展露天赋，可惜你太笨，十三四岁，还错别字一堆。他不厌其烦地跟你讲，要多读多写，人不能偷懒，越懒越笨。但你怀疑是你的笨，让你看上去比别人懒。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;一年夏天，他收到风，说是省里要办一次少年诗歌赛。从那天起，每晚一放学，他就将你摁进办公室的椅子里，耐心地跟你讲，写作的要领&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;名词要准，动词要狠，思想要像气球，一路往上升，情感要像皮球，一路往前滚。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;可椅子里的你，表面在听，实则在等。等这个身为父亲的男人，在你的面前过足文学大师的瘾后，带你回家。因为你知道，你妈到了饭点还见不到你们，准会跑到家附近的桥边等。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;耳朵不灵光的她，成天木着脸，在家洗衣做饭。每天只有吃晚饭时，脸才活泛起来。饭桌上，无论你们说了什么，她都像是听到世上最美的诗句一般，献上自己最真挚的笑容。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;你爸又发现你心不在焉了，急躁地说，闭上眼，好好想。可你一闭上眼，就看见你妈站在桥边的路灯下等待的身影。他在等，你在等，你妈也在等。越等，时间就过越慢。从那时起，你就怀疑，等待是让时间变慢的最佳方法。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;截稿日将近，他下了死命令&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;今天写不出，就不回家。说完就跑去走廊上抽烟。当他走回办公室时，竟发现你对着物理课本写写画画，刚要骂，又在课本右上角的空白处，瞥见几行歪歪扭扭的小字。他默念几遍，露出了笑脸，叫你收拾书包回家。一路上，他死死捏着那本物理书，仿佛那才是他的亲儿子。因为在他眼里，那几行小字，勉强算诗。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;刚到家附近，你就看见桥边人头躜动，地上满是红色的液体，鲜红，暗红，淡红，混成一团。人们见你俩来了，顿时安静。直到一个邻居凑上前，含糊其辞地跟你爸说了几句，你才反应过来，是桥上一辆卖西瓜的大卡车溜了坡，将你妈活生生碾了进去。所以地上了红色，是西瓜的，也是你妈的。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;你妈的死，叫他的时间像是凝固了一般难熬，他不再写诗，而是写起了关于时间的小说，仿佛只有写小说的时候，时间才能过得快一点。可在你眼里，路灯下再也没人等你了。没了等待，时间就流得飞快。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;半年后，他因迟到早退被学校开除。丢了工作，时间更多了，小说一遍遍地写，他也渐渐活进了自己的小说里，有时他是小说里的哲人，有时他借小说人物之口吟诵散文，更多时候，他是一名研究时间之谜的科学家。久而久之，甚至自称洞悉了时间的密码。人一旦活进了自己的世界，时间便开始飞逝。衰老成了一瞬间的事。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;好了，现在他老了，而你长大了，你发誓绝对不会变成像他一样的大人，要多陪家人，不让家人等，孤单是家里最不该出现的情绪，可账单永远孤单先到，你又该怎么办？ &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;此时外头传来叽叽喳喳的对话，林远音也停止了论述&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;是李泉鸣的小孙女正吵着要离开。林远音一脸不屑，却仍侧耳探听。小阮合上本子，一抹额头细密的汗珠，眼前的笔记，对她而言好似一场虔诚的告解。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;妈妈，我要回家！ &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;再过一会儿。 &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;一会儿是多久？ &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;两分钟！ &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;两分钟真慢！ &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;是你觉得慢！ &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;听到这里，林远音激动得要从轮椅上蹦起来似的：&amp;ldquo;不对，之前想的都不对，时间从来就没有加速！ &amp;rdquo;他搓了搓脑袋，捋下一根白发，在眼前稍稍拧动了两下，小阮就将合上的本子再次打开，笔头有模有样地空转。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;时间没有加速，因为时间其实是一种能量。能量不会凭空消失，它只是从大人的身上，转移到了孩子的身上。所以，孩子才觉得时间慢，而老人觉得时间快。 &amp;rdquo;林远音中气十足，但说得很慢，仿佛真理正在他表达的过程里，缓缓展开。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;时间是宇宙里最重要的东西，最重要的东西得留给最重要的人。 &amp;rdquo;说完，他凑到桌上的老式白瓷茶杯前，颤颤巍巍地揭开杯盖，闷头嘬了一口。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;你还记得这杯子吗？ &amp;rdquo;小阮试探性地问。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;是前两天大福带来的。 &amp;rdquo;林远音得意地说。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;那，大福是谁？ &amp;rdquo;小阮有点担心他的精神状态。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;和你一样，也是我的学生嘛！ &amp;rdquo;说完眼神狡猾地瞟向小阮手中的本子，像是在开一个悠闲的玩笑。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;这一刻，小阮仿佛看到林先生从时间的牢笼里走了出来，脑中的一切不过都是茶杯里的风暴，而他缓缓盖上了杯盖。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;要不要去阳台晒晒太阳？ &amp;rdquo;小阮起身。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;林远音轻笑一声，轮椅开始向阳台滑动：&amp;ldquo;光走了1.5亿公里，来到地球，轻抚人类的瞬间，被我们称作晒太阳。 1.5亿公里远啊，但光不怕，它跑得快！书上说，速度越快，时间就越慢，速度越慢，时间就越快！ &amp;rdquo;讲到这里，林远音坐浴般地浸入了夕阳，摸了摸自己渐暖的膝盖：&amp;ldquo;我跑得慢，所以，我的时间，越来越快了，这很科学。 &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;科学的事情，我不懂，我只知道，一会儿该吃药了。 &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;林远音皱起脸，仿佛撞见了一副身不由己的画面。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;今天宝玲姐休息。 &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;林远音眼珠一转：&amp;ldquo;那你把笔记，给我检查，检查过关了，我才吃药。 &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;小阮将本子往胸前一捂。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;林远音笑起来：&amp;ldquo;别藏了，我都知道！ &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;知道什么？ &amp;rdquo;小阮心虚地将本子拿开，扫了一眼。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;你的字，和大福一样丑。 &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;小阮松了口气，转身回房，将本子摊开，从第一行的三个大字&amp;ldquo;举报信&amp;rdquo;开始，将投喂安眠药的丑事，通读了一遍。确认了没有错别字后，又小心翼翼地裁下。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;这时阳台传来林远音的声音：&amp;ldquo;我坐在椅子上等你，坐成了另一把椅子，你站在路灯下等我，站成了另一盏灯。 &amp;rdquo;小阮抬起头，朝阳台望过去，林远音的手，正在摊开的物理教材的右上角，反复摩挲着，那几行稚嫩的小字。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;那天以后，林远音坚信自己解开了时间之谜，从此再无困惑，万事万物都在他的心里整齐地排序。尽管他每天下午，仍会坐在阳台里等待，不是等待谁的到来，只是因为他相信，等待是让时间变慢的方法，这是他最后的天真。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;该吃药了吧！ &amp;rdquo;林远音说。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;来了。 &amp;rdquo;小阮低下头，合上本子的瞬间，突然发现，刚刚裁去的，竟是笔记本里的最后一页。 &lt;/p>;&lt;/p>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;责任编辑：梅不谈&lt;/p>;
