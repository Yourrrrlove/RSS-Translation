The &quot;break&quot; here first refers to the relationship with oneself, which is to cut off one&#39;s own worries; &quot;Throwing things away&quot; refers to the relationship between people and things; &quot;living&quot; means that you want to leave those people who are not your friends, and it refers to the relationship between you and others. &lt;/strong>;Severance is actually a very profound proposition. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I myself am also an in-depth experiencer of &quot;disengagement&quot;. In the past few years of practicing &quot;disengagement&quot;, the greatest pleasure I have experienced is probably &quot;freedom&quot;. The deeper I practice it, the more I experience it. , I feel more and more free. I really like my current &quot;clean&quot; state. In the process of constantly asking whether I really need this thing, this thing, this relationship, I constantly understand myself, know what I need most, and devote my limited energy to what I really need. , in this process, I became clearer and freer. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;1. Focus on the present, and treat things that are not currently needed but take up &quot;bandwidth&quot; every time you see them. Break&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;What is bandwidth? It refers to the capacity of a person&#39;s mind, and can also be understood as the memory of a computer. &lt;/strong>;When I bought a beauty device a few days ago, the merchant gave me a small car refrigerator as a gift. At first, I planned to keep it, because in the past two years, I have planned to buy a car. After moving, commuting to and from get off work will be difficult. More convenient. But there are still at least two years until I buy a car, and do I really need such a car refrigerator? Can&#39;t it be replaced? the answer is negative. But every time I see it, I always take up part of the &quot;bandwidth&quot; to think about how to deal with it, and then repeatedly remind myself that I need to buy a car to arrange its fate, which increases the uneasiness of &quot;waiting&quot;. Good feeling. So I decisively chose to sell it on a second-hand platform. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Getting rid of unnecessary things is like cleaning out the garbage in your mind, releasing your &quot;bandwidth&quot;, reducing your burden, and making your state lighter and freer. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;2. Be clear about your own needs. For things that are not so necessary but seem to be &quot;cheap and convenient&quot;, treat them as &quot; ;She&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;In today&#39;s era of endless marketing methods, various marketing short videos and live broadcasts will bring many products that seem &quot;cheap and convenient&quot;, and we seem to products needed. After making impulse purchases, I discovered that most of them will not be used for a long time or even at all. For example, there are all kinds of super versatile single-piece clothing, fitness equipment, multi-functional kitchenware, etc. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Since practicing renunciation, every time I want to buy something, I will add it to the shopping cart first. After a while, if I still need and like it, then I will take it seriously. Consider whether to buy it. I can still remember the scenes of handling things I didn’t need on impulse before. Now I will naturally think twice about purchasing them. And every time the impulsive emotion passes and I find that I don’t need it and don’t like it that much, I will regret it at that time. Not happy with the purchase. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;As time goes by, my world is almost filled with things I like and need. This feeling is really comfortable;&lt;strong>;And spend money, time and energy on necessary and important things. , my thinking becomes clearer and my life becomes freer. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;3. Ineffective social interaction, when &quot;leave&quot; &lt;p>;As the degree of interruption and abandonment in life deepened, I began to examine my relationships with others. To me, which relationships are like objects, just occupying my own &quot;bandwidth&quot;, and are actually just a kind of consumption. . &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Marquez&#39;s &quot;One Hundred Years of Solitude&quot; said: &quot;The secret to spending your old age safely is to sign a decent agreement with loneliness.&quot; &lt;strong>;I have always felt that everyone is actually lonely. It does not only appear in later years, but when we are young, we have countless curiosity, endless enthusiasm and many unclear illusions. These things bury our &quot;lonely&quot; nature. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;When these clouds are slowly lifted, we gradually see the true face of loneliness. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;After graduation, I changed three jobs. Although they were all in Zhejiang, they were in different cities. Ten years later, the people who stayed with me couldn’t even use five fingers. over. I began to realize that&lt;strong>;some social interactions are completely ineffective and leave little real value other than consuming yourself. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;So I started to stay away from those ineffective social interactions. At the beginning, I had almost no ability to refuse, because I cared about other people’s opinions, wanted to get along well with my colleagues, and wanted to expand myself. circle, fear of being alone, etc. Later, I slowly discovered that &lt;strong>;status in society depends on one&#39;s own value, not useless flattery. If you don&#39;t love yourself, others will not love you. &lt;/strong>;So I no longer consume myself in these ineffective social interactions, but actively spend all my love on worthy people. Later I discovered that by only getting along with worthy people, I became more relaxed, happy and free. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Take the initiative to control your own life, starting from giving up. &lt;/p>;&lt;/p>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;Editor in charge: Zhou Ziheng onewenti@wufazhuce.com&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For information on the call for papers, please see the @ONE Studio pinned on Weibo.

In order to arrange a job for her child, the proud mother humbly sought out a relationship with her cousin, but the verbal attack and defense turned into a battle...&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>;&lt; p>;&amp;ldquo;Looking for a job is a big deal for Xiaoyu. As a mother, you can help her. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;How to help? Help her submit a resume or help her attend a job fair? &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Grandma smiled: &amp;ldquo;Stop arguing! I want you to go find Sun Jingjing. She works for the government and has more connections than us. She can help with this kind of thing. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;My mother frowned: &amp;ldquo;I haven’t had much contact with her for many years. Whenever she comes to the door, she asks for help. I can’t open my mouth. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;For Xiaoyu, there’s nothing I can’t open my mouth about. After she has arranged Xiaoyu&#39;s work, you should spend money and treat guests, so as not to waste her time. I mean, your mother has such a strong relationship. If you don’t use it at this time, when will you use it? &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;We all said things are not that simple. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;It’s not that simple! Can you tell me how difficult it is? There are a few things in this world that are really difficult, and it’s all about being scared of yourself. I think you just don&#39;t want to do it. If you really can&#39;t keep your face and lower your head, your mother will take Xiaoyu on endless trips. When her aunt came to visit, she, Sun Jingjing, had the nerve to refuse to help? &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;My mother doesn’t speak. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Seeing that my granddaughter is about to graduate and has no job, why can’t she be unwilling to contribute even a little bit of effort? &amp;rdquo;Grandma took out my milk to stimulate my mother. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I couldn&#39;t help but rush to talk: &quot;There will be a job fair in the semester after get off work. I can find a job by myself.&quot; &amp;rdquo;I don’t understand why my grandma is so persistent in finding me a job through a trust relationship. I myself am quite resistant to this kind of thing. Not to mention how tough it is to be self-reliant, I was admitted to college four years ago, and the pride my family felt when they mentioned me everywhere is still vivid in my mind. How come four years later, I have become someone who needs help? This gap is still unacceptable to people in a short period of time. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Grandma said: &quot;I didn&#39;t say you couldn&#39;t find a job, but can you get into a government agency on your own?&quot; Walk around, your cousin has to be able to get you in. Isn’t working in the government more respectable than working in a company? Apart from anything else, if someone has something to do in the future, we dare to stand tall and say that there is someone in our family. How tough is it? The government agencies have few things to do, are stable, and won&#39;t tire you out. And once you enter, you will be served an iron rice bowl, and you will have no worries for the rest of your life. What is better than that? &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Where is the iron rice bowl these days? &quot;I argued: &quot;In your era, you could have an iron rice bowl for a lifetime. Things have changed a long time ago. Being able to eat anywhere is called an iron rice bowl. One must have real abilities, otherwise he will not be able to hold any bowl firmly. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Well, that’s pretty good. But which bowl to hold, and whether to hold it firmly or not, is another matter. The current situation is that you have to have a bowl in your hand first. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Grandma’s words were artistic, but to put it bluntly, she still didn’t believe that I could find a decent job based on my ability. But for a while, I couldn&#39;t produce any evidence to prove that I could do it. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;In the first half of my senior year, I participated in campus recruitment and social recruitment. But firstly, my grades and qualifications are mediocre, and secondly, I am a girl. Although many employers do not specify that they only recruit boys, it is well known that boys have an advantage in the job market. I submitted more than a dozen resumes, but one or two companies returned the application in front of me, flipping through two pages, saying it was inappropriate without any extra explanation. Three more companies have sent out interview invitations. One of them is in Xinjiang, which is too far away and I don’t want to go. He was eliminated at the first meeting. The last one finally squeezed into the leaderless group discussion. The interviewer who walked around didn&#39;t like it - I should say he hated me. I was a girl who was aggressive and sharp. Before the discussion after the meeting, she used personal heroism and lack of understanding. I was eliminated on the spot on the grounds of teamwork. I was confused. If you don’t perform well, you will definitely be eliminated, so I tried my best to express my opinions whenever I had the chance to discuss in the group. I didn’t expect that I would be eliminated if I overperformed. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;At that time, there were eight girls in our dormitory, four of whom were taking the postgraduate entrance exams and one who was taking the vocational college entrance exams. Only three of them, including me, were serious about looking for jobs. Among the remaining three, one whose boyfriend signed a contract with a state-owned enterprise can also sign &quot;family members&quot;, and the other received an offer from a company in another place before the winter vacation. As a result, I was left rootless and drifting in the wind. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Even looking at the entire series, although there are many people who have not signed a contract, there are really not many people like me who have not signed a contract and have no backup plan. Many people are trying to do both, one is taking postgraduate entrance exams and the other is looking for a job, and they don’t want to be left behind. With the end of the postgraduate entrance examination, a group of exam party members will join the job recruitment in the second half of the semester. Most of these people have a dazzling transcript. Once they get involved, my chances of winning will be even less. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Don’t worry about which bowl, put one in your hand first. Grandma’s words were irrefutable, so I had no choice but to shut up. After a brief consideration, my mother finally made up her mind and said, &quot;Then I&#39;ll give it a try.&quot; &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Grandma felt relieved and said, &quot;That&#39;s right, it can be done, but if it can&#39;t be done, just say it can&#39;t be done.&quot; You have to try everything first. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;This day is the second day of the Lunar New Year. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;2&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;When I got home that day, my mother called my grandma and told me that she wanted to ask my cousin to help me find a job. Grandma was very supportive. . My mother was on speakerphone, and my grandmother on the other end of the phone directed my cousin to go to the first drawer of her bedside table to get a small blue book. She had bad eyesight, so my cousin helped me find my cousin’s cell phone number and read it to my mother. My mother wrote down the number, and grandma asked her to contact them first to see what they said: &quot;If she doesn&#39;t accept the offer smoothly, just tell me and I&#39;ll go find her.&quot; &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Unexpectedly, the people over there were so cheerful and asked my mother to take me to my workplace on the eighth day of the lunar month. Before calling, my mother hesitated and hesitated for a long time. It was already around eleven o&#39;clock when she hung up the phone. She guessed that I had already gone to bed, so she didn&#39;t reply. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;On the third day of the Lunar New Year, while I was still asleep in the morning, my grandparents, aunt and uncle all came to visit me to pay New Year greetings. There was no notice before coming, so my mother was in a hurry. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;It must be what the grandparents meant. In addition to gift boxes, the two families also brought meat and vegetables to the door. My aunt and second aunt helped my mother in the kitchen, and the whole family had lunch at twelve o&#39;clock. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;My grandparents came with some luggage and said they would stay at my house for a few days. My mother was busy, so I was not idle either. I helped them take the luggage they brought back to the bedroom where they lived before and return the things to their original places. While I was packing, my grandma came in and asked me: &quot;Is it your grandma&#39;s idea to go find Sun Jingjing?&quot; &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I didn&#39;t expect her to ask this, and I didn&#39;t know how to answer it appropriately, so I had to smile and said perfunctorily: &quot;I haven&#39;t found a job, and grandma is very worried.&quot; &amp;rdquo;After saying that, he continued to pack his things. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Grandma sat down on the bed: &quot;Of course I have thought of what your grandma can think of, but there are some things that your grandma doesn&#39;t know about. Let&#39;s not mention other things. Your father passed away and Sun Jingjing didn&#39;t show up. It makes our family feel very uncomfortable. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;I know. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;But your work is a big deal right now. Since your mother is willing to lower her head, you should go with your mother first and see what&#39;s going on. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;This cousin I have never met is about the same age as my dad. It is said that because my aunt&#39;s and grandma&#39;s homes are close to each other, she was almost raised in our house when she was a child. She has a good temper. My dad is also someone who never admits defeat. The two followers, my aunt and my second uncle, fought over and over again for who they would side with. When we were older, she was in the same class as my mother in junior high school, and we were congenial, close friends, and competitors. My parents fell in love and got married, and it is said that she had a share of the credit. Later, things like this happened, and the relationship gradually became estranged. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I have never met her, but I have often heard my family talk about her. My aunt and uncle mentioned her with a certain amount of admiration and respect in their voices. Grandpa doesn&#39;t take everything seriously, but grandma complains too much. When my parents talked about her, their words sounded sour: &quot;We are uneducated and do small business. We have nothing to say to someone who is a high official. We all go our own way.&quot;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;My dad once told me that the reason for the deterioration of their relationship with my cousin could be traced back to me. When I was two or three years old, my cousin was transferred to work in some unit of the provincial government. After working there for about half a year, she got a foothold and suggested to my dad that I transfer my household registration to her name. Once you get rid of your agricultural status, you will be a &quot;commercial grain eater&quot; from now on. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;In the eyes of rural people at that time, &quot;eating commercial grain&quot; symbolized the working class, and the status of urban residents was much higher than that of farmers who faced the loess and turned their backs to the sky. Until I entered junior high school, a transfer student wrote in his weekly diary, &quot;I must study hard, arm myself with knowledge, go out of the countryside, and take off this layer of peasant skin...&quot; and was regarded by the teacher as a negative example in the class. Think about it and criticize the boy for being narrow-minded. What the teacher didn&#39;t know was that because of her public &quot;execution,&quot; the boy&#39;s name had since been replaced by the word &quot;peasant.&quot; Among my classmates at the school where I was a student, farmer was a contemptuous and insulting term. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The household registration policy at that time was very strict, and it was very difficult to transfer from rural to non-agriculture unless you were admitted to school, transferred to work, or changed your registration as a family member. The proposal to change my household registration for me, who was only two or three years old, was within my ability and would certainly not be rejected. It must have been the result of my cousin&#39;s careful consideration. It means repaying kindness, but more importantly it means showing ability in front of everyone. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Anyone will be stunned by this good news. My parents are no exception. They agreed immediately. However, he soon regretted it. To be precise, my dad regretted it. He said he felt uneasy: &quot;The more I think about it, the more wrong it becomes. Isn&#39;t this equivalent to transferring your ownership to Sun Jingjing in vain?&quot; What is her intention? Then I still don’t believe it. Based on myself, and based on your intelligence when you were little, in the future we won’t be able to get a city residence, so we have to be her daughter? Besides, being an official is a great thing. My daughter might become a higher official than her in the future and be in charge of her. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;When I was talking about this, I had just entered college, which was when my dad was most proud. In his eyes, college is much higher quality than technical secondary school. What he didn&#39;t notice was that times had changed. In my cousin&#39;s time, not many people could go to technical secondary schools. In my time, there were college students everywhere. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;My cousin’s confident proposal was politely rejected by my father, which made the relationship between the two families become delicate. From what the adults said, there were some other nasty things going on between my parents and my cousin. As time went by, the relationship between the two became weaker and weaker. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Actually, ever since my mother agreed to ask Sun Jingjing for help, I have been very conflicted. And my grandma, who is such an open and straightforward person, hesitates when talking about my cousin, which makes me even more conflicted. On the one hand, I don’t want to force my mother to bow down to others because of my own incompetence. On the other hand, I was really worried about my future. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The conflict continued until the morning of the eighth day of the lunar month. After my mother had breakfast, she began to dress up seriously. I couldn&#39;t eat it, so I simply packed it up and lay on the sofa waiting for her. Before going out, grandma picked out four high-end New Year gift boxes brought by her aunt and uncle and put them at the door, and told my mother and I to pick them up. Only then did I realize that the real reason why she and my grandfather came to visit us in a hurry early in the morning on the third day of the Lunar New Year was to prepare gifts for us so that we could save some money. They moved into my house for a short stay, and they also wanted to support us mentally. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Before my father passed away, my grandparents lived in my house. After my father passed away, despite my mother&#39;s efforts to stay and say she was too lonely to live alone, the old couple moved to my second uncle&#39;s house. The underlying meaning behind the words is that my mother is still young, and they are delaying her future. There is no need to specify this future, everyone knows its specific direction. For this reason, my mother went back to her parents&#39; house and cried in front of my grandma, saying that my grandparents moved away not long after my dad passed away. What would people who didn&#39;t know think? This is setting her up for injustice. She also swore that although my father had been ill for more than two years, she had never had any unwanted intentions. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Grandma advised my mother: &quot;You are also a mother, so you can&#39;t just think about yourself.&quot; You have to be considerate of the old man&#39;s thoughts. As far as I&#39;m concerned, there&#39;s nothing wrong with what your parents are doing. If you let me go, I&#39;ll do the same thing. The eldest son is gone, but there is still a younger son and a daughter. Instead of living with your own son and daughter, you are tied to your widowed daughter-in-law. How will outsiders evaluate your two younger brothers and sisters? &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;He added: &amp;ldquo;What’s more, you are now in the prime of life. If you have no idea about remarrying in the past, can you guarantee that you won’t have any idea in the future? How strong your will is is your business. As elders, your parents must take this change into consideration and move out early, so as not to wait until there is a real situation to start disputes and get into trouble. But... your father is used to being an old man and has nothing on his mind. He can&#39;t think so carefully. It must be your mother&#39;s intention. Speaking of your mother, she has only studied for a few days, and her brain is hundreds of times stronger than many people who have studied. She is a very wise person. You have to understand her good intentions and stop fooling around. &amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;My mother is not fooling around anymore. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;My mother also realized the hidden intention of my grandparents’ dual material and spiritual support when my grandma told us to get the gift box. She was stunned for a moment, picked up the two gift boxes, and strode towards the elevator. She was afraid that if she stood for a little longer, she would look panicked in front of her grandparents, which she couldn&#39;t bear the most. I quickly picked up the other two gift boxes and followed them closely. After leaving the community, the two of them walked to the bus stop in unison. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Since my father became ill, my mother, who used to spend a lot of money, always take a taxi when going out, and wear famous brands all over her body, seems to have changed into a very frugal person. And I have always been frugal. During the years when my parents were busy with business, my grandma and aunt took care of me most of the time. The two of us have lived through hard times, and my aunt said: &quot;Save a dime here and a dollar there. If you add up, you can save dozens of dollars in a month.&quot; &quot;Grandma&#39;s words don&#39;t make much sense, but her actions always show that she makes the best use of everything.&quot; I was nurtured in such an environment, and frugality is almost my nature. Since I was a child, I have been able to walk without taking the bus, and I can take the bus without taking a taxi. When I grew up, I didn’t compare prices when buying clothes until I found the cheapest one, and I never placed an order. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;When my dad was still alive, my mom always laughed at us, the Jing family, for being so picky. After my father fell ill, his business failed, and the money spent on medical treatment was like a torrential river, and it was gone forever. Money can only go out but not come in. Faced with this dilemma, my mother had to start her life of careful planning. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;After fighting tenaciously against the disease for more than two years, my father finally used up all the family’s savings and all his energy and passed away. After he passed away, my mother discussed with me several times that I wanted to start a small business of my own. She is only in her forties and is still young. Of course I support her starting a business. But every time when it came time to invest money to take action, she would always retreat, fearing that she would lose her face and borrow some money and end up wasting money. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Conflicted with the endless stream of ideas and the worry of investment failure, half a year later, it was my recruitment season, and my mother said that she would wait until I found a job before making any plans. Another six months passed and I still had no job, so she became even more worried, making money even tighter. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;My mother told me during a phone call that she has never been short of money for most of her life. Money is always a living thing anyway. After spending it today, you will get money tomorrow. I am getting old, and my life is suddenly limited by money. This is called the world of uncertainty. I advised her not to think too much, to act on whatever comes to her mind, and to decide whether she succeeds or not, she must work hard first. She sighed: &quot;The principles are all right, but we don&#39;t dare to make any mistakes in the current situation of our family.&quot; When I fell down, your dad and I would help me and I would help you to get up. Who will help me if I fall now? You can never get up again, you know? &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;So when my mother dressed up carefully, holding a gift box in her hand and carrying a bag, but walked to the bus stop as a matter of course without any struggle, I felt sour. I began to regret that I was not strong-willed and could not become such an outstanding daughter as my father imagined. If I could not be disturbed by his illness and death at that time, and spend my energy on studying and taking exams instead of random thoughts, maybe I wouldn’t be so passive in the job market, and maybe I could get job offers, graduate students or civil servants at the same time. admission ticket. Maybe if I have protection, my mother will not have to live a frugal life against her will, let alone bow to the person she least wants to bow to. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I was dreaming about &quot;what if...&quot; in the spring and Autumn period, but my mother was worried, and the two of us were silent all the way. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;3&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;After getting off the bus, there are a series of small restaurants on the roadside. I didn&#39;t have breakfast, and I was a little hungry when I saw what I was eating. Then I thought, my cousin made an appointment to meet at this time, probably to have lunch together. Looking at the watch, it&#39;s half past ten. If we eat at twelve o&#39;clock, we still have another hour, so I can bear it. Unexpectedly, I walked to the door of a Hanzhong Hot Rice Pizza and my mother asked me: &quot;You didn&#39;t eat in the morning. Do you want to eat something to make up for it?&quot; Before I could reply, she continued: &quot;If you have enough time, walk forward another fifty meters. Diagonally across the intersection is the gate of her unit. It&#39;s after eleven o&#39;clock, but it&#39;s not even eleven o&#39;clock yet.&quot; &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;My mother looked at me with anxious eyes, as if she was searching my face for confirmation. I knew immediately that I had to say yes. She needed to slow down before meeting her cousin. A popular saying nowadays is to do psychological construction first. I nodded and entered the Remipi shop. When I entered the store and smelled the aroma of ingredients and seasonings, I felt extremely hungry and felt that I could eat a pig and a cow. He opened his mouth and asked for a bowl of rice noodles and a steamed bun. After I finished ordering, I immediately thought about not being too full, and told the landlady that I didn’t want the buns, just a bowl of rice noodles. The landlady asked politely: &quot;A bowl of rice noodles for two people?&quot; &quot;My mother replied to her good-naturedly: &quot;She can eat it by herself. I have eaten at home.&quot; &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;It’s not a meal, there are no other customers in the store. I put the gift box away and asked my mother casually: &quot;I see you are familiar with the road. Have you been here before?&quot; &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;My mother said: &amp;ldquo;Not only have I been here before, but when she and her husband were getting divorced, your aunt came to me to try to make peace, and she came here countless times. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I wondered: &amp;ldquo;Why does she go to work to make appointments for everything? I&#39;ve only heard of people taking their work home, but I haven&#39;t heard of anyone taking their family&#39;s shortcomings to work. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;My mother rarely laughed out loud and said teasingly: &quot;I&#39;ve been to her house twice, and both of them are slovenly. It&#39;s such a nice house, but it smells like a mess once you get in.&quot; Maybe she was too shy herself. Besides, it would be great to make an appointment with the work unit. There will be someone dedicated to cleaning the office, and she will yell at her when someone comes to see her. This will show how capable she is. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;While we were chatting, rice noodles were served. The lady boss put down the bowl and turned to get the chopsticks from the sterilizer box. I said no, took out the cutlery box I brought with me from my bag, and took out the chopsticks. When the lady boss saw this, she didn&#39;t know whether she was really praising me or criticizing me: &quot;My little fellow is very particular.&quot; &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;There are many people in Hanzhong who open this kind of snack bar in Xi&#39;an. Out of an inexplicable trust, when we eat small restaurants outside, we usually choose ones opened by Hanzhong people. My mother and I usually speak in dialect, and it’s not surprising to be recognized as a fellow villager in restaurants. However, the landlady was talkative and asked us where we were in Hanzhong. My mother said it. She asked again: &quot;I just heard you talking about Sun Jingjing. Is she the Sun Jingjing who works at the Labor Bureau opposite?&quot; &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;My mother was surprised: &amp;ldquo;Do you know him? &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;We have been doing business here for at least seven or eight years, and we are all from the same hometown. Sometimes she gets tired of eating in the cafeteria and comes over to eat hot rice noodles. We are an old acquaintance. She helped my son find a school when he went to junior high school. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;My mother was a little distracted after listening. I was pounding in my heart, wondering how much of what we just said had been heard by this talkative landlady, and whether she was a gossip. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Seeing that my mother didn’t answer her words, the boss’s wife turned her face away and praised me sincerely: “Some young people nowadays are very environmentally friendly, and I think it’s very good. To be honest, disposable chopsticks, Not necessarily very hygienic. I bring my own tableware when I go out. Diseases enter through the mouth, right? &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;While eating, I nodded with a perfunctory smile. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Speaking of diseases, she talked to herself about the physical examinations she and her husband had some time ago. One was found to have atherosclerosis, and the other was found to have osteoporosis and lymph node disease. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;If I didn’t have a physical examination before, nothing would happen. During this physical examination, every part of my body was defective. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;My mother came to her senses and asked: &quot;Okay, what kind of physical examination are you going to do?&quot; &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;My shopkeeper and I will definitely not do this for no reason. This is not like last year when Director Tiansun came to have dinner and chatted, saying that she had an old cousin who died before he was even fifty. Lung cancer. It was found to be in an advanced stage and the cancer cells had metastasized to the brain. Director Sun told us that if she, an old cousin, had a little bit of health awareness and went for regular physical examinations, she would not have died at such a young age. This is a typical example of making money if you have life, and spending money if you don’t have life. The speaker has no intention of listening, so I discussed it with my shopkeeper. Although the physical examination is expensive, costing several hundred a time, life is still at stake. So I went to the hospital to check... Oh, by the way, what is your relationship with Director Sun? &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Old watch! &amp;rdquo;My mother said with a straight face. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;4&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;After finishing the rice noodles, my mother took a deep breath, crossed the road with the gift box and walked towards the bus stop for the return trip. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I understand why she is so angry. But what my cousin said was true. My dad was indeed delayed. He complained about dizziness for a while and no one cared. It wasn&#39;t until Youzhen fainted that everyone took him seriously and sent him to the hospital, but it was too late. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I also secretly thought that maybe being angry with my cousin was just a reason, and my mother just happened to be able to avoid having to ask for help this time. However, when the bus came, she stood still and refused to get on the bus. I didn&#39;t say anything or push her, I just waited behind her. She is slightly chubby, has a lively temperament, and has always had a solid figure. However, during that short period of time, she was fettered by the two gift boxes in her hands, dragging her towards the east where she was asking for help; at the same time, her pride and stubbornness refused to compromise, and she wanted to go to the south on the return journey. Torn apart internally and externally, the back actually showed a sense of helplessness, thinness and loneliness. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The cars on the roadside are very noisy. But I heard her sighing slightly clearly. She turned around, the anger gone from her face. &amp;ldquo;Let&#39;s go. ’ she said. It took me back on the journey of asking for help, but the pace was no longer so hasty. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;I just...&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;She suddenly turned around and said to me. I walked a few steps quickly to be beside her so that I could hear clearly what she was going to say. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;I just feel disgusted that Sun Jingjing talks about your dad everywhere. Your dad is a person, not a lesson, not a lesson learned from others, do you understand? &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I didn’t say anything. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;But I also think that your father is gone and you need a job. Besides, if we hadn&#39;t eaten at that Remipi shop, we wouldn&#39;t have known her gloating face. Just pretend you don’t know. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;What a coincidence. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Yes, God arranged it this way. Your dad and I have been fighting with her for half our lives. Now that your dad is gone, it’s boring to think about those things. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;After a while she added: &amp;ldquo;Your grandparents are so old and have worked so hard. I can’t let them down just because of my impatience. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;After a while she said again: &amp;ldquo;Let’s talk about it...it’s already here. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;These words were obviously not meant for me, they were used by her to persuade herself. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;When I reached the intersection, I suddenly remembered something and stopped my mother to ask if someone from my cousin’s workplace would misunderstand her for taking bribes if she was seen carrying these things. My mother shook her head: &quot;Knowing that it&#39;s still the Chinese New Year, no one goes out empty-handed.&quot; The time and place were all decided by her, which shows that people don&#39;t have such concerns. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;My mother took me into the office building, went up to the second floor and turned left. When I reached the door of the second office, my mother stopped, turned around and looked me up and down, giving me a very quick look. After reading it, his mouth tightened, his nose sighed, his shoulders sank, and he stretched out his hand to knock on the door. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The voice coming from the room was full of anger: &quot;Please come in.&quot; &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;When I opened the door, there was only a middle-aged woman with a fat body and short hair sitting in the twenty-square-meter office. The office was simpler than I imagined, with two desks, a computer, two filing cabinets, and a few chairs. There isn&#39;t even a sofa. It&#39;s not like the configuration that someone with high authority should have. And her personal image was beyond my expectation. She was not official at all. Compared with my mother, who was carefully dressed, she looked like a rural housewife who had been working on trivial matters for many years. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;As soon as I entered the door, my mother greeted me enthusiastically: &quot;Happy New Year!&quot; &amp;rdquo;It will be closed soon. My cousin waved her hand to indicate no need, and called to my mother: &quot;Is this Xiaoyu?&quot; Very rich. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Her eyes didn’t even stay on me for more than two seconds. Rich...don&#39;t you mean I&#39;m fat? But I wasn&#39;t offended. When she opened her mouth, a condescending aura immediately emerged from her expression, posture and tone of voice. That is a kind of review and has nothing to do with criticism. One word came to my mind like a reflex: official accent. Like all young people who hate authority, I immediately felt an irrepressible disgust. What puzzles me is that at the same time as disgust, there is also admiration. Yes, I can&#39;t deny that I succumbed to the tone of voice that I hate, which reveals one&#39;s identity with just one mouth. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;My mother didn’t answer and put the gift box down against the wall. I also put down the gift box in my hand. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;表姑一边拉椅子给我们坐，一边笑道：&amp;ldquo;来就来，提这些显眼的礼当，不知道的人还以为你要托我办啥大事呢。 &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;看她神情，对我们提的礼盒并不抗拒。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;我妈说：&amp;ldquo;本想着多年没走动了，趁机会去给你拜个年，结果你假期还没空。东西又是年前早早备好的，都挺贵，不送出来浪费了。 &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;让你破费了。平时也不见走动，一来提这么些礼当，要不是有事找我帮忙，我都感觉有点受不起。 &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;表姑两次提到找她帮忙，话递得尖锐。我妈神情如故：&amp;ldquo;我们平头小百姓，哪敢有事没事跑这么尊贵的地方来打扰你这大忙人。就是多少年没走动了，她爸一走，突然闲下来，怪寂寞的。想到以前门庭若市，朋友来来往往，现在各自为了生计奔波，都疏远了。想着重新联络一下感情，以后日子还长，遇着事儿好有个说话的人。 &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;这么一说，确实是，时间过得好快，转眼孩子都这么大了。不过，联络感情归联络感情，我得先声明，我一辈子拿死工资，没多少积蓄，你要是来借钱，我可没有啊。 &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;我妈突然恼了，语调高昂地说：&amp;ldquo;不借钱，我周海萍这辈子都用不着借钱。虽然我们生意停了这些年，她爸看病也花了不少，但不怕给你交个实底，那点花销伤不了我们什么，二三百万存款还余得下。小宇眼瞅要毕业参加工作了开始赚钱了，那钱只要不乱花，保她风风光光嫁出去，保我后半辈子吃香喝辣是没问题。更何况还有她姑她二叔，还有我娘家，再怎么混得背，也不至于沦落到要跟人借钱的地步。 &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;面对我妈的激烈情绪，表姑神情没多大变化。倒是我吃了一惊。大年初二在外婆家，我说起我妈被环境逼得由奢入俭，外婆不以为然：&amp;ldquo;你们那家底我能不知道？你妈有钱，她是装穷装给我们看呢。 &amp;rdquo;当时我用沉默表达了对外婆这番话的抗议。那么眼下看来，外婆的话并非空穴来风，我家确实没到山穷水尽的地步？ &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;但我立刻又想到另一件事。大三时，系里统计经济上需要帮扶的学生，班长和团委考虑到我爸生病花销巨大，帮我报了名。回头我跟我妈打电话顺便提了一嘴，没想到她无论如何接受不了我变成帮扶对象这件事，逼着我去跟班长说我们家不需要任何帮助，把机会留给需要帮助的同学。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;想来本质上我妈接受不了的是，在别人眼里我们没钱。她怕被人小瞧，任何人。这一点上，奶奶比外婆更懂她。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;表姑对我妈应该是非常了解，知道什么话能刺到我妈痛处。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;我是开个玩笑，你看你这么认真。 &amp;rdquo;表姑若无其事地说。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;我妈这时意识到她情绪过激，端起手边表姑倒好的水喝了一口，态度缓和了些：&amp;ldquo;我脾气你知道&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;想了想，又说：&amp;ldquo;其实我这趟来，还真有事，不过是点小事。 &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;我就说你无事不登三宝殿你还不承认，看吧&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;呵，你们大门大户的，哪有小事。我几斤几两你知道的，不一定帮得上&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;不过你可以先说说。 &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;真是小事。就小宇不是快毕业了吗，我们就想着你能不能在哪个部门给她安排个合适的工作。 &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;表姑嘴角微翘着露出为难的神色。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;我妈说：&amp;ldquo;我知道你的本事，这点事难不倒你。你哥那俩儿子，一个初中毕业一个高中毕业，你都给找下工作了，我们这好歹是上过大学的。小宇呢，人勤快，也聪明，落谁手里都使得上，绝不会丢你的脸。她又上进，也知道感恩，以后真混出个样子来，肯定不会忘了她表姑的提携。 &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;这段话里有典故。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;表姑给两个侄子安排工作，高中毕业那个，第一份工是保安，机关单位，待遇比别处好，活也轻松。他一个月干完，工资到手，招呼都不打人不见了。钱花完又回来。只得重新安排。如此四次三番，给他姑气的，回回咬牙切齿说这最后一次帮他。那侄儿这时候往往男子汉一样，胸脯拍得&amp;ldquo;砰砰&amp;rdquo;响：&amp;ldquo;姑放心，我一定珍惜&amp;rdquo;，珍惜的结果是最长一份工干了四个月。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;初中毕业那个倒是老老实实在食堂干了半年，不知什么原因跟人打架，把人肋骨踹断了，赔了不少钱才把事情摆平。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;两兄弟恶名在外，再后来工作就不好安排了。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;这些事，老家那边传遍了。说孙静静吹得千能万能，咋把两个侄儿安置不下。又顺延说到女人还是不敢太能耐，太能耐的留不住老公，婚姻不幸福。一个女的，婚姻不幸福，事业再成功有啥用。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;表姑听我妈提起这事儿，心里当然不高兴，冷笑着说：&amp;ldquo;我安排的那些都是不入流的工作，你女儿高材生，恐怕委屈了，这忙我帮起来太吃力。 &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;吃力，就是能帮嘛，你放心，我不会让你白忙。 &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;知道你们家有钱，但这不是钱的事儿。 &amp;rdquo;说着，门外走廊有三三两两的人路过，每个人手里都拿着饭盒。有人朝门里招呼：&amp;ldquo;吃饭了，孙处。 &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;你们先去，我这来了两个亲戚。 &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;又是老家来找你帮忙办事的？ &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;表姑嘴上否认：&amp;ldquo;不是不是。 &amp;rdquo;那神情语气，显然是默认了。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;我妈表情还是没什么变化，起身招呼表姑：&amp;ldquo;一起出去吃吧。 &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;不。不。就在这吃。 &amp;rdquo;表姑态度坚决：&amp;ldquo;你在这儿吃过小宇还没吃过，也让她尝尝咱省政府机关的饭菜什么味儿。 &amp;rdquo;没等我妈回应，表姑便起身从一个闲置的办公桌柜子里取出两个碗，出了门。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;5&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;表姑去打饭，我和我妈坐她办公室，沉默地等着。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;我一颗心忐忑不安。两人的对话像是给对方留着余地，又像是在把对方往死角逼。来前我没想到会这样，我以为要么成要么不成，几句痛快话的事。压根没料到会陷入这种奇怪的局势中。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;那天的午饭是油泼面，我和我妈共吃一份，还有一份用塑料袋装回来的凉拌猪头肉和素菜。省机关单位的饭，我是没尝出味道。我妈有没有尝出什么，我不得而知。饭打回来摆上桌，三个人嘴都占着，再没多余的话说。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;吃到尾声，表姑跟我妈说：&amp;ldquo;我认真想了，这忙我帮不上！按说表哥不在了，你孤儿寡母的，我该尽心尽力帮一把，我也想落你们家的人情，但实在是能力够不着啊。 &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;我妈不紧不慢：&amp;ldquo;呀你这太谦虚了。你就放心办，遇到使钱的地方，尽管开口。以后你再能用上我们的地方，我也绝不推辞。 &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;表姑笑笑：&amp;ldquo;我家虽然没你家有钱，但日子也过得去，我又没啥不良爱好，不会有问你们借钱的那一天。其他事情说白了，真有要帮忙的，也不是你能帮上的。你女儿有能耐，我看得出来。她以后混个出人头地，我不羡慕，绝不去沾你们的光。当然，她要混差了，我也不落井下石。咱们的社会总体上来说是公平的，只要是不偷不抢凭本事吃饭，吃成什么样子都不丢人。 &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;上一分钟，我和我妈才吃完那碗机关油泼面，嘴边还残留着没擦干净的辣子油晕染出的红黄难辨的油渍。这一分钟，通往我饭碗的其中一条路已经被堵死。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;我妈愣一下，机械般地从包里掏出小镜子和纸巾，仔细地对着镜子擦掉嘴边的油渍，又拿出粉和口红补了妆。我妈打扮自己的过程行云流水，在那不到一分钟的时间里她冷静了下来，她冷静的速度和她被震惊到的速度一样迅疾。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;收好小物件，我妈不慌不忙站起身，对表姑说：&amp;ldquo;谢谢你请我们吃午饭，娘俩一碗油泼面，大恩大德我记着。她爸一家当初待你不薄，人走了，你不去送他一程也就罢了。一年多了，你连体恤你亲姨，去看看她的心思都没有。还在外人面前编排她儿子。你别以为我不知道，我什么都知道。这都无所谓。我跟你认识几十年，没求过你什么，第一回来，你就要摆架子扫我威风，也无所谓。可小宇有什么错，你阴阳怪气砸挂她？我算是明白了，难怪那时候王建生抵死抵活，儿子都宁愿不要，也不跟你过。 &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;最后一句话像是一直在嘴边放着，只等这个出口的机会。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;在一切搞砸再也无可挽回的那一瞬间，我产生了一个朦胧的猜测，这才是我妈想要的结果。我赢不赢无所谓，但你别想在我身上找自尊。她因为我爸而灰扑扑了几年的人生需要这点刺激。她主导了这次失败。也许连她自己都没有意识到。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;大四下半学期毕业前，我总算签下了本地一个小公司。在那之前，很多个为工作焦虑的时刻，我忍不住自责，如果不去吃那家汉中热米皮店吃早饭，我妈是不是就不会那么生气，事情是不是会有另外一副样子，比如我不用到这时候还在为工作奔波。自责到最后往往忍不住怪到我妈头上，不明白她进门之前还信誓旦旦既然已经抛下面子就一定要把事办成，怎么事到临头，竟只顾自己痛快，什么都不管不顾了。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;好多年以后的某个秋天午后，大概下午一点左右，我的男朋友跟我提出了分手，很突然。说的时候他已经坐在飞往另一个城市的候机厅里。我非常震惊，出于自尊没有多问，爽快地答应。等反应过来分手总得有个原因，再打电话过去时，那边始终保持关机状态。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;在震惊、愤怒、伤心之后我迎来了脆弱的心碎期。上着班，人坐在工位上，身体却止不住地向座位下面滑。心里被好多疑问和起起伏伏的情绪堵得八风不透，像随时可能窒息。无论如何都止不住眼泪时，我知道我必须得找个人聊聊了。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;在脑海里把朋友们翻过一遍，又在通讯录里翻了一遍，只有D最合适。 ABC们，或是理性过剩同理心约等于零，或是喜欢充当心理医生分析来分析去永远分析不到重点上，或是鸡汤话爱好者，只会一股脑让你加油给你打气。只有D，她为人刻薄，有时会拿我当假想敌，可是她对感情上的事非常敏感，在一些莫名其妙的地方很能和我产生共鸣，而且看待问题往往能直中靶心。她会明白我正在经历什么，会说些出人意料的，或好笑，或真正能让我宽慰的话。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;我们相互了解。这是最重要的。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;于是打电话过去。在电话接通之前我是那么脆弱，一碰即碎。电话接通后，很奇怪，从听到她那套假客气的问候开始，我体内那些坚固的碎片像得到号召似的，自动汇聚、愈合，抵抗般地跟她较量起身材，工作，收入和爱情来。当然了，分手的事绝不可能在这种场合下说出口。就好像我过得众星捧月，快乐无边，就好像当初我们家只剩两三万的存款我妈也敢夸口说有两三百万一样。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;挂掉电话，我的坚固还支撑了一阵子，随即又散掉，回归到脆弱的状态。这次我却失去了倾诉的欲望。因为这次只是脆弱，但不再是一击即碎的程度了。可我还是在原地蹲了下来，失声痛哭。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;就是那时候我毫无缘由地想起我妈。想起那天带我走出表姑单位的大门，走过十字路口，走到公交车站的她也是那样，重新陷入无助和单薄。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;在对过去的回望中，我不自觉地从另一个角度看待那天发生的事。我妈说她寂寞，想重新找回关系，想有个说话的人，那大概是把真心放在客套话里说了。她隐约想在表姑那里寻求的不只是我的工作，还有她对理解的一份渴望。我爸的去世和家庭境况急转直下让她变得脆弱，而长辈比如我奶奶和外婆，晚辈比如我，出于年龄段和经历上的鸿沟，无法给予她精准的安抚和宽慰。于是离过婚，有很多年都过得不甚如意的表姑成为一个思量后相对合适的人选。只是，当她示弱并微妙地表达意图时，却被对方忽略戏谑，那示弱便不由自主地被坚硬的攻击性替代，从而陷入和对方较量的旋涡。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;在从D那里寻求安慰失败的那一刻，我猛然理解了多年前我妈面对表姑时的心情。也是在那时候我明白到，理解只在卷进过同样旋涡中的人之间，才有达成的可能性。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;那些年里，我和我妈逐渐适应了我爸去世的缺憾，相互依靠搀扶着，全部注意力用来和生活较量。像表姑说的那样，我们凭自己本事吃饭，也一步步走出了困境。没多出人头地，也没多落魄，普通地过着每一天。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;听说表姑去二叔家看过奶奶一次。放下礼品，沙发上稍坐了坐就走了。好多年前的事了。那之后她逐渐从我们生活和话题中淡出，再未被提起。 &lt;/p>;&lt;/p>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;责任编辑：梅不谈&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;征稿信息见@ONE一个工作室置顶微博。更多编辑部的有趣日常请关注小红书：ONE一个编辑部。 &lt;/p>;
