Only my mother Lizhen still remembers the movie. In her narration, we once again enter the original dream. &lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Before three o&#39;clock in the afternoon, there were already many customers at Cheung Chai Ice Room in Causeway Bay. I was busy in the store as usual, finishing my order. Send it to the kitchen, and then check out the goods just delivered. Just as I was complaining that the supplier had raised prices again, Uncle Zhiyong opened the door and sat down at an empty seat in the corner. He glanced at the guests at other tables in a somewhat uncharacteristic manner, looking uneasy. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I went over to greet him: &quot;Uncle Zhiyong, are you still the same?&quot; &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;He looked away and raised his head: &quot;Yes, Xiangzi, how is your mother doing lately?&quot; &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;She is the same as before. &quot;I turned to the chef and said, &quot;Table No. 3, the toast is dripping with oil and is added with frozen milk tea!&quot; &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Uncle Zhiyong and my mother are both old employees of Shin Kong Cinema, but since my mother suffered a cerebral infarction and suffered dementia last year, she has not gone to work. Uncle Zhiyong has always missed her very much. He would come to the ice room I opened every now and then to take care of the business. He would talk about the current situation of the theater, what new movies were released, and how many viewers there were. He asked me to go home and tell her about it. Occasionally, he would also bring some supplements. I hope She gets better soon. I refused to charge him every time, and he refused to agree. Later, I had to secretly add more weight to his afternoon tea. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;But today, he told me something else, something that was commonplace yet seemed like a fantasy. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;He kept rubbing his hands, mumbling words, his eyes blank, as if he was about to enter the courtroom, nervous. I put the dinner plate on the table and sat down opposite him: &quot;Uncle, are you feeling unwell?&quot; &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;He shook his head and took my hand, his eyes full of urgency: &quot;Xiangzai, let me ask you, have you heard about what happened in the cinema recently?&quot; &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;I am already in my 20s, call me Axiang! &quot;I pushed the tea in front of him, &quot;What about the movie theater? People are dead? &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;He patted my head: &amp;ldquo;Die you big-headed devil! &quot;He then took a deep breath and said mysteriously: &quot;I tell you, you may not believe it, but all the movies in the cinema have disappeared. For some unknown reason, they are gone...&quot; ;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;The movie disappeared, what does it mean? &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;It’s just because it’s weird that I’m here to tell you! Two days ago, I discovered that the movie in the copy could not be played, and I thought it was because of a malfunction in the projector. Later, someone from a Broadway theater came to borrow the copy, and after talking to each other, I was able to confirm that it was true. Our union has contacted the reporter and news should be released soon. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Is it that exaggerated to publish news? &amp;rdquo;While listening to him, I calculated the morning&#39;s income on the order menu. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Uncle Zhiyong saw that I was absent-minded, so he cut open the toast and ate it. After drinking half a cup of frozen milk tea, his thoughts became smoother, and he held me down and explained it in detail from the beginning. After another half cup of milk tea, I roughly understood the whole story of the &quot;disappearance of the movie&quot;. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Three days ago in the morning, Uncle Zhiyong put the newly received copy into the machine. It was all white, and so were all the other copies. Almost overnight, all the copies in Hong Kong cinemas were cleared. The movie files stored in them were gone, gone, and formatted. Even the images on the old films in the library became blank. The scary thing is that all theaters in Hong Kong have suffered from the same &quot;movie robbery&quot; without exception, and not a single movie has survived. No trace of outsiders committing the crime was found in the surveillance. It was not a technical failure of the projector, and it also ruled out the possibility of conspiracy theories such as hacker intrusion. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;With no films to show, movie theaters had to close down, and people in the film union were panicked. I don’t know which agency should handle this kind of thing. No one knows how it is done or how to save it. It&#39;s like a creator appeared out of thin air, gently erasing the traces of movies left in this world with an eraser. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;This is the end of cinema. &quot;Uncle Zhiyong held the glass tightly and sighed, as if he had just finished telling a thrilling suspense story. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Then I will go home and see if the value of the complete collection of &quot;Star Wars&quot; Blu-rays can increase in value if put up for auction online. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Hey, you have some imagination, Xiangzi! &quot;Uncle Zhiyong rolled his eyes at me and said, &quot;You young people have all seen science fiction. Is it possible that it is some high-tech attack that covers all Hong Kong, locks files in the same format, and then clears them with one click? technology? It was written in a novel, right? &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;They say it’s not Xiangzi! &amp;rdquo;I put away the plates, &amp;ldquo;Uncle, have you ever counted which movies have disappeared? &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Let me think about it...&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; He scratched his head, with childlike confusion on his face, milk tea foam still stuck to his stubble, &quot;By the way, what are some of them?&quot; Woolen cloth? &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Until dusk came, he couldn&#39;t remember any movies that had ever existed. There was not a single scene or a line. It was like you knew that there was such a person, but you could never remember him. Who is it, what does it look like, where have I seen it. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Movies have disappeared, and not only that, but people’s memories of them have also disappeared. If there is really the kind of blow he mentioned, then the hippocampus area of ​​the human brain is also targeted. If memories can be selectively erased on a large scale, does that mean that our understanding of the world is also different from the movies we watch? Is it just as unreal? I soaked my hands in the cleaning pool, and the foam floating on the water spread to the edge. I came back to my senses, shook my head, and didn&#39;t dare to think about it further. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;However, the movie is a trivial matter. I can&#39;t take care of this at all now. I still have my mother waiting for me to take care of her at home. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;After get off work, I went to the nearby vegetable market to buy some side dishes and took them home. My mother and I lived in Kam Ping House near King&#39;s Road. The house was not big, and you could see the bottom at a glance when you opened the door. There were several utility bills posted on the door. I tore them off and went in sideways. There was an unpleasant smell in the room. My mother is still lying in bed. Half of her body cannot move on her own and she needs someone to take care of her three meals a day. After dinner every day, I will take her out for a walk in a wheelchair. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Drink chicken soup tonight, pretty girl! &amp;rdquo;I opened the window and helped her up. The dust danced in the afterglow that came through. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;After my mother was diagnosed with dementia, she became emotionally unstable and often lost her temper. She felt unfamiliar with everything around her. She didn’t even recognize the TV, mobile phone, or refrigerator. She was like a child who had just arrived in this new world. In her mind, all the memories of her previous life faded, except for me and the movie. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Axiang, are there any new movies showing today? &amp;rdquo;She supported my shoulders and struggled to move her legs to sit at the table. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;There are no movies on today. &amp;rdquo;I helped her tidy up her hair and put the food and dishes on the table. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;She tried her best to control her trembling right hand, picked up the chopsticks and poked me in front of me: &quot;You lied to me, how is it possible, you damn Xiangzi!&quot; &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;After dinner, I pushed her into the wheelchair and went for a walk. The East District Corridor near Tangshui Road Garden is the scene she sees most often, with intersecting streets and remaining lights, vehicles moving closely together, and pedestrians of various colors passing back and forth. On narrow streets, neon signs compete for space overhead. The most prosperous neighborhoods and the most popular cities are often only separated by an alley. I will tell her the name of each street, the location of landmark buildings, the best food on Wan Chai Road, and the best night view of Victoria Harbor. Then as soon as she turns the corner, she will ask again, where is this and why have I never been here before? I had to explain again until she became sleepy and stopped answering. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The Shin Kong Cinema is not far from our home, and she insisted on going there tonight to see it. The light sign in front of the theater door has been turned off, and the wall next to it is covered with posters. Eight o&#39;clock in the evening was supposed to be the time when the most people were watching movies, but the door was closed and no one was operating the ticket office outside. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Why doesn’t anyone buy a ticket? &quot;She was a little excited and tried to stand up, &quot;Oh, I have to go take a look.&quot; &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;No, no, no,&amp;rdquo;I protected her, &amp;ldquo;There is a fire drill today, and all the nearby movie theaters are closed. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Her eyes lingered on the extinguished light sign, and she sighed softly: &quot;Oh, then come back tomorrow, come back tomorrow.&quot; The last time our cinema closed was a few years ago... &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Her voice rose a lot: &amp;ldquo;Why don’t you remember! The business has been closed for so long and everyone has to be quarantined. How bad! I haven’t watched a movie for a long time, and I’m scared to go out every day. I don’t know how everyone survives it. Hey... By the way, Mom, do you still remember the movie you watched? What happened? &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Of course, I used to watch it every day. Let me think about it...Well, I&#39;ll tell you when I get back, I&#39;m a little sleepy... &quot;Okay, let&#39;s go home.&quot; &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;On the way home, I used to look up and see the stars scattered in the night sky. Next to the North Star was a faint band of light. At first glance, I thought it was a UFO. His eyes returned and fell on the Tin Hau Temple Road in the distance. The bright light shone from the tall buildings, like a secret that could not be hidden. Does mom still remember the movie? And I have really forgotten. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;A few minutes away from home, my mother became quiet. I recall that when I was a kid, I didn’t need to buy a ticket to watch a movie at Sunbeam Cinema. Every weekend, the theater was packed with people. I was placed in the last row, with the small window of the projection room right above my head. The projector was like a lighthouse, casting flickering light and shadow on the opposite screen, which was amazing. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I have been listening to my mother talk about the development history of Hong Kong&#39;s film industry since I was a child. In early 1896, Louis Lumiere&#39;s assistant came to Hong Kong and screened many films, and this was how films were introduced to Hong Kong. After his departure, Hong Kong films did not resume activities until 1898. In 1907, many cinemas were opened in Hong Kong, and the number and number of public screenings increased than before. This was the first peak of Hong Kong&#39;s film industry. Over the next half century, there were ups and downs. It was not until the peaceful era, in the early 1980s, that three theater chains, Shaw Brothers, Golden Harvest, and Golden Princess, were established, and Hong Kong movies began to enter their peak era. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;My mother and Uncle Zhiyong are the earliest generation of theater employees. They started as projectionists and ticket inspectors, and gradually became responsible for running the theater. They stayed in this profession until they were old. Movies have always occupied most of their daily lives. They are not just stories about chatting after dinner, but a real existence in another world. Fantasy, martial arts, suspense, police and gangsters, fairy tales, countless different worlds have appeared in this universe, and they are like light chasers traveling back and forth between the two universes. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;My mother’s youth and the youth of Hong Kong movies complement each other. She personally experienced that golden era, but I can only describe the prosperity in my imagination, looking at it from a distance, but unable to touch it. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;After arriving home, my mother fell asleep quickly. I unconsciously opened the &quot;Star Wars&quot; Blu-ray disc in the cabinet and opened it on the DVD player that had been idle for a long time. There was only a snowflake on the screen. Uncle Zhiyong is right, movies have really disappeared. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;After that, the news about the disappearance of the movie spread like ripples. Within a few days, the headlines of major media were crazily occupied, with sensational headlines-&quot;The movie completely disappeared, suspected of being attacked by an alien civilization.&quot; &amp;rdquo;&amp;ldquo;Cinema closures, nationwide alert&amp;rdquo;&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;Rumors are spreading everywhere on the Internet. Some people say that a clearing signal is sent from the universe. The signal stays in Hong Kong and clears the movie. The comments agree. There are many. Even the neighbors who came to the ice room to drink ice would talk about it. They asked each other what movies they had watched, but no one could remember it. I put the food on the table and said to them, &quot;Me too.&quot; &amp;rdquo;Then he shrugged his shoulders and reassured them that it was no big deal. Without the movie, Hong Kong would still be the same Hong Kong. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;In the evening, I accidentally mentioned it when I was cooking. My mother was as anxious as if she had lost something: &quot;This can&#39;t happen!&quot; Xiangzi, let me tell you, I remember all the movies I watched! &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Okay, mom, tell me about it. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;What surprised me happened at the ordinary dinner table, with the sunset shining in as usual. While my mother slowly put the food into her mouth with a spoon, she talked about movies: &quot;Let&#39;s talk about &quot;Exile&quot; and &quot;Gunfire&quot; first. Johnnie To&#39;s movies are my favorite! &quot;Exile&quot; tells the story of a few days before Macau&#39;s return to the motherland, the killer Ah He returned to his hometown with his wife and daughter. Soon, the underworld boss sent two hitmen to kill him. As soon as the news got out, two more hitmen came to stop him. These five old killer friends who have known each other for a long time reunited, with their own purposes, and the story that followed was exciting... I followed her narration into the movie, This is a story I have never heard of, full of chilling Jianghu atmosphere. I feel like I am on the mountain that besieged them in the movie, staring at their accompanying figures, and the unpredictable fate ahead. &quot;Really? You didn&#39;t make it up, right?&quot; &quot;As soon as I finished speaking, I stopped talking. How could she make up a story now? &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Don’t interrupt, I’ll continue talking to you. &quot;Gunfire&quot; is even cooler. Five people who don&#39;t know each other are tasked with protecting a gang boss... She is full of energy and has talked about several Hong Kong police and gangster movies. Out of curiosity, I asked: &quot;The streets in Hong Kong are so narrow and there are so many people. How were these fights and chases, car rollovers and gun battles filmed?&quot; &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Some chase scenes are reported in advance and the streets must be blocked. Some of them were secretly filmed in broad daylight. The staff hid in the corner with equipment. As soon as the director called Action, the actors rushed into the crowd and started acting. Did you know that the movie &quot;Zhao Zhi&quot; also attracted real police because the scenes of gang gatherings filmed in a busy city were too real? &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;From that day on, I would listen to my mother talk about a few movies every night, like the wonderful experience of One Thousand and One Nights. My long-standing memory of Hong Kong has become clearer because of the resurgence of movies. I was born after the millennium, and the wave of the old times has long faded. Old Hong Kong people must adapt to the changes brought about by the integration of the old and the new, and our generation is facing Right is a whole new wave. I rarely watched Hong Kong movies in the past. Those vivid characters, the Supreme Treasure who put aside his persistence and faced his fate, the knight who hid in the rivers and lakes, the police officer who endured the humiliation and lurked in the gang, the beautiful woman who was waiting for the ticket and her lover to fly away, they, at least Still alive in the movie and in my mother’s memory. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Uncle Zhiyong came to the ice room again. I told him that my mother still remembered the movie. He didn’t believe it at first until I told about &quot;Journey to the West&quot;, &quot;Ashes of Time&quot; and &quot;Infernal Affairs&quot;. &quot;Golden years&quot;. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;He leaned closer and listened carefully, the corners of his mouth slightly raised, causing wrinkles on his face, and his cloudy eyes glowed brightly, staring at me as if he had been reborn. The movie story became an ordinary sentence in my mouth, the background of the time, the protagonist&#39;s encounter, the turning point of the plot, the ending that left a lingering aftertaste... He was swimming in the invisible movie, his eyes were slightly closed, as if he had entered Zen meditation. Such a state. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;For a while, Uncle Zhiyong brought many film colleagues to the ice room to listen to me talk about movies, one film a day. My mother and I also have more words in common than before. When I get home at night, she will eagerly ask everyone&#39;s reaction to the movie, and I say they really liked it. Then she would recall the next part with interest and a sweet look on her face. I recorded all my mother’s narration. Before I started speaking in the ice room, I had to listen to it again, imagine the scenes of the movie in my mind, add some expressions and movements that I designed, practice the tone of speaking, and try my best when speaking. Restore the character&#39;s state of mind and give the listener a sense of involvement. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;There are more and more customers in the ice room, and most of them come for movies. Uncle Zhiyong simply writes an advertisement outside the ice room &quot;Today&#39;s story about xx movies&quot; to promote it every day. I also added a sign in front of the door - &quot;Lizhen Film Oral Room&quot;. Lizhen is my mother&#39;s name. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Every afternoon when the movie started, the guests surrounded me, holding drinks in their hands and looking forward to it. I didn&#39;t expect them to take time out of their busy day to listen to a story that had nothing to do with their own lives. Fantasy, martial arts, suspense, police and gangsters, fairy tales, and then there was a heated discussion about who has better martial arts, Dongxie or Xidu, whether Yu Jiaolong died after jumping into the valley, and whether Fahai had touched the green snake. Ordinary heart... As long as I tell the truth enough, those characters will all be present, attached to me, speaking their own lines, performing their own stories, and in this world, leading us to temporarily escape from the real world. , arrive at another place, and then return to the same place. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;This is our movie One Thousand and One Nights. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;After the end, I will tell the guests to tell the story about the movie to your family, friends, and colleagues, and let them listen too, so that Lizhen’s movie story can continue to spread, &quot;This way If so, you can get a 10% discount on ice cream next time. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The fruit plum next door joked: &quot;More discounts, Xiangzi!&quot; &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I kicked him: &amp;ldquo;I didn’t even take away the tickets for the movie, that’s funny! &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;When they disperse, I know that the movie will be spread by word of mouth among Hong Kong people, and more and more movies will be known to everyone. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;A few weeks later, there was new news. Astronomy enthusiasts from out of town investigated the UFO incident in Hong Kong. The Hang Seng Index of Hong Kong stocks rose sharply at the opening. The Hong Kong Film Association established a film restoration technical team. Robots can help fight against it. Cancer... For Lizhen, the most important thing is that the Shin Kong Cinema reopened, and the boss invited me to talk about movies in the cinema. I took this job and gave it once a week, even though the screen was empty and the theater was full. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I will never forget the nervousness I felt when I stood on stage for the first time. Everyone’s eyes were focused on one place, as if I was the movie character walking off the screen. That day, I talked about &quot;Himalayan Star&quot;, a fantasy comedy full of exotic locales. My mother said that this movie is more than just a comedy. Among so many Hong Kong movies, it is the first to talk about conjectures about the origin of the universe and the birth of human beings. Although the plot is nonsensical, it contains profound philosophy. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I continued to preach: &quot;Our world is actually a dream of Brahma. Everyone&#39;s life is the scene in his dream. As soon as he wakes up, this world will disappear immediately, and then A new reincarnation of the universe begins again! &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;After finishing speaking, I breathed a sigh of relief, but they were still immersed in the artistic conception of the movie. Finally, I bowed to the audience and said, &quot;Welcome to Xiangzi Ice Room. Today&#39;s guests will receive a 20% discount.&quot; &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Laughter and applause surrounded me, and Shin Kong Cinema became lively again. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;My mother was very happy when she found out and shouted that she would go back to work immediately. But she didn&#39;t understand that her condition was gradually deteriorating, and she would only stay sane when talking about movies. The doctor said she didn&#39;t have long to live and asked me to stay with her more. I instantly felt like I had no one to rely on in the world, so I could only try not to think about the future. Sadness would not help. I would rather cherish every day I lived with her and listen to her talk about every movie she had ever seen. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;A month later, after the movie ended, I returned home and found two strangers sitting in the house. After falling ill, my mother rarely interacted with outsiders, and unfamiliar environments made her restless. But my mother was smiling today and seemed to have a good chat with them. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Hello, Mr. Chen Faxiang, I am Dr. Huang Rui from the Greater Bay Area Biomedical Technology Research Institute. &quot;Seeing that I was wary, a tall middle-aged man took the initiative to show his ID, and then introduced a younger man: &quot;This is my colleague, Dr. Li Tianyang. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Hello, may I have any questions? &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Actually, we are here to find your mother. We have learned about the disappearance of the movie. Officials have launched investigations and studies with major astronomical and scientific research institutions. There is no conclusion yet, but we There have been many conjectures. Dr. Huang held his chin and thought, &quot;If it is an unknown force, what is its purpose? Could it be possible that movies can become some kind of weapon?&quot; If it&#39;s a coincidence, why do only certain things get eliminated? &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Dr. Li said: &amp;ldquo;The science fiction writer Liu Cixin&#39;s novel &quot;Ball Lightning&quot; mentions a technology in which macroelectrons excited by lightning can find specific objects in a wide range and carry out precise strikes. It is due to its resonance frequency, which is caused by the energy released from the excited state back to the ground state in an instant. He believes that the moment macroelectrons release energy to an object through ball lightning, the object becomes a quantum state, existing in the form of a quantum cloud and wandering in any space. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I was silent for a moment, these theories were nothing more than fantasy to me. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;What he means is that the movie may also become a quantum state. When you observe it deliberately, the movie will disappear, but when you don’t observe it, the movie will exist again,” Dr. Huang added , &quot;But your mother Lizhen is the only one who completely remembers the movie.&quot; &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;That’s true, but are you sure she is the only one? There are so many people...&quot; I looked at my mother. She was sitting aside, like a child who had done something wrong, listening to the judgment of an adult. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;It seems so at present, but I didn’t expect that your mother is... &amp;rdquo;I took the call. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Perhaps because of this, her brain was atrophied and escaped this blow. In addition, she is a staff member who loves movies very much, so her memory of movies has been deepened. &amp;rdquo;Dr. Huang tried his best to explain in words that I could understand. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;So, she is the key person to solve this incident? But her current physical condition makes it difficult for her to cooperate with you... No matter what, I don&#39;t want her to face these complicated situations. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;I understand your concerns. The old man can’t stand the trouble. But if your mother can enter &quot;hibernation&quot;, she can live longer, and she may even be completely cured in the future. Will you give her this chance? &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Are you sure that the hibernation technology in the novel can be used in reality? &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Dr. Li raised his lips slightly: &amp;ldquo;Many technologies are more mature than we imagined, but they have not yet become popular. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Just to keep the movie? &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Dr. Huang nodded: &amp;ldquo;Leave more possibilities for our civilization. &quot;He breathed a sigh of relief again, &quot;It&#39;s like a paradox. We don&#39;t remember the movie and don&#39;t know its meaning. But if we don&#39;t make efforts to redeem it, how can we understand its meaning? &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I don’t think about the height of civilization. I just follow their theories and start to fantasize--if my mother can live, in the future, she will meet an old me, or my son or daughter. , or my grandson or great-grandson. Yes, she can survive. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;After thinking for a moment, I already had the answer in my mind, and my stiff body relaxed. I told them my opinion jokingly: &quot;Have you ever thought about the possibility that movies are the legacy of high-dimensional life?&quot; It is a dream in the human world. When you wake up from the dream, the movie will no longer exist. It’s hard to say, this universe is just a dream of higher-dimensional life. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;When my mother heard this, she smiled and clapped her hands: &quot;This movie is good, this movie is good!&quot; &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The night before I decided to &quot;hibernate&quot;, I pushed her to the Shin Kong Cinema for the last time, and the door was replaced with a promotional poster for a spoken word movie. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Where is this? &amp;rdquo; she asked. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;The place where you have worked all your life. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;She waved her hands feebly, her thin backs covered with age spots, and muttered: &quot;Hey, I don&#39;t remember, I don&#39;t remember...&quot; Uncle He Zhiyong held a farewell ceremony for her in the ice room. She was a little older than before, her eyes were droopy, her face was dull, and the neighbors gathered around her, talking as cordial as usual. She occasionally answered a few words, but no longer recognized anyone. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;It took a few days to complete the procedures, and they took my mother and me to the institute. The hibernation cabin is like a white capsule. After complicated tests, my mother lay down in it. I stood aside and caressed her forehead. Her face was calm, which calmed my anxious gaze. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;She said: &quot;Zai, I also want to tell you about a movie, a mother and son, Hong Kong, memories... It&#39;s very simple and bland, but I can&#39;t remember the ending...&quot; ;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Mom, what is the name of this movie? &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Oh, I can’t remember clearly, &quot;Made in Hong Kong&quot;? It seems so, yes...&quot; Before she finished speaking, she must have been sleepy and slowly closed her eyes. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Soon, the hibernation capsule will be activated, and she will embark on a journey to the future. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;See you in the future, Mom. &amp; rdquo; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; On the way home, I looked at the way to be confused, and I couldn&#39;t help but fly to those movies, and shuttled back and forth in the unreasonable scene to alleviate the pain of separation in the real world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Is the God of Movies dreaming in another world now? Will the movie come back? Mom&#39;s dream is awake, would she remember me? Is there such a movie that my mother has watched, which is what we have experienced in Hong Kong. This one? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;Made in Hong Kong&quot;, right, mother? &lt;/p>; &lt;/p>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>; Responsible editor: Li Jialong &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; See @ONE&#39;s studio on Weibo.
