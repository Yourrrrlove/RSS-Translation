She has experienced a lot in more than ten years, and her individual voice in facing the times can be expressed. &lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;em>;&lt;strong>;In this world, while a person is seeking to escape, his relationship with others becomes closer and closer. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/em>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;一&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;This year’s spring in Shanghai is particularly long. Time also slowed down. On March 31, Xiao Ye thought there was only one tree in the community. Looking out from different windows, they are all the same green. In late May, she discovered there was more than one tree. It just so happened that those windows faced the same giant pine trees. They covered the community with ease, and made her feel that time had really stopped and rolled forward frame by frame. The clothes hanging out looked like a writhing woman due to her big belly, and the sounds were evenly distributed in the corners within her sight. She felt (or thought) she was surrounded. Everything around him seemed to be just a continuation of slow motion. Whenever evening approaches, Xiao Ye often feels like he did when he was young and accompanied the elderly to listen to Peking Opera - the things in front of him fall steadily, but his inner feelings for the repetitive things change day by day. She didn&#39;t know when this feeling would disappear. Maybe if you go out for a walk, it will turn into nothing. But she didn&#39;t have such a chance for the time being, so she calmly felt it growing in her heart. By mid-to-late June, she finally came out of her career as a homebody. When she saw the busy traffic on the street and the seemingly newly opened shops, she suddenly felt that there seemed to be some new memory that was taking away those slow-motion memories. Gap filling. The undoubted pain she had suffered in the past had grown into a towering tree. She even had the opportunity to enjoy the shade under the tree. She felt very peaceful and was not overly happy or thankful for the excitement in front of her. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;At the end of spring last year, it rained for three days in a row. Every time before going out, Xiao Ye felt that the rain was about to fall. Walking past the &quot;works&quot; that failed to finalize in the sculpture classroom, it seemed as if everything in front of me was melting. There are very few people posting photos wearing masks on social networks. Nucleic acid tests are so common that Xiao Ye sometimes forgets their existence. It’s like it’s a morning clock-in ritual. In the past few years, Shanghai’s four seasons have never been so distinct. Spring and autumn are very short, and summer starts at the end of March. In September, the city is still very hot, the National Day holiday is a key point, and then after a short autumn. Winter seems to be very cold, but the cold often comes from the body. Outdoors, a heavy coat is enough. Just because autumn is short and the transition period is not enough, winter seems to be even colder. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Fortunately, this spring is too long and lasts until May. Xiao Ye suspected that summer had already blended into the spring team and appeared in stages when the daily temperature was the highest. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;In fact, it is because the temperature difference suddenly narrows. It&#39;s not the temperature difference within a day, it&#39;s the temperature difference between the previous few days and the next few days. Rui Rui made a popping sound on the other end of the phone, as if she was eating an orange, spitting out white tendons, &quot;Maybe in a few days, we will just go through autumn.&quot; At that time, you will definitely miss the present. Your room will definitely get cold in autumn. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Xiao Ye lives on the first floor. The bedroom faces west, and the sun only comes in in the afternoon. The room was damp and cold in autumn and winter, so she put on cotton slippers earlier than others. Once, a cockroach passed under the sofa. She saw it and stamped it to death, completely ignoring Rui Rui&#39;s screams. But she is afraid of mice. There was always a clicking sound on the top wall of the kitchen at night, and she thought it was a mouse swimming by. Someone came to catch the rats, but they just sprayed pesticides in places where rats might be infested to block possible openings. She felt uneasy and picked up a cat at the pet store. It&#39;s a three-month-old civet cat. It&#39;s not very affectionate, and its smell is a bit strong. But since it came, there have been no strange noises at night. But Rui Rui doesn&#39;t like cats very much. Since she got this cat, her visits to Xiao Ye&#39;s house have become less frequent. Although every time she comes, she still rolls around on Xiao Ye&#39;s bed, just like she did when they were younger. At that time, Xiao Ye was wearing bulky black thick-rimmed glasses and staring at the flat body teacher, but what came to his mind was a picture of the bone structure. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Before going to Shanghai to study medical school, Rui Rui once comforted her: &quot;The art department also needs to understand the structure of the human body, but they use their eyes to &quot;dissect&quot;, while you use your hands. &amp;rdquo;Rui Rui was a few years older than her. At that age when she was growing up rapidly, she could always say unexpected things. She trusted Rui Rui more than anyone she could be close to, especially family members. Rui Rui had also visited the house in her hometown once. Yao Mutao was still alive at that time. During the day, she leaned in front of the door under the sun, looking at the people coming and going, like a sedan chair swinging back and forth. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The people on Jingxiang Street have always lived in a fixed place. Take the Xiao family as an example. Factory workers of Yao Mutao&#39;s generation all live in that area. From the original bungalows to two-story buildings, in the late 1990s, small courtyards for each family were built on the homestead. The houses on the street have changed, and the road seems to be much wider. By her generation, the entire street was already occupied by private residences. Although there are some shops, it is still one of the few roads in the county that can be described as quiet. But because of its quietness, Yao Mutao&#39;s cough downstairs could wake her up in the early morning. Everyone who had walked through this street had often met Yao Mutao&#39;s eyes. Xiao Ye was familiar with that look. In her dream when she was twelve years old, Yao Mutao&#39;s lower body was a ball of orange flames, and her eyes seemed not to be opened, but they were always looking at her sideways. When she woke up, she felt that she had grafted Yao Mutao&#39;s demeanor into a certain fairy tale. The weak fear dissipated, and she only felt that every time she pushed the bicycle past Yao Mutao, she felt that she had been watching her. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;When she was studying anatomy, every time it was her turn to practice class, what came to her mind was the hand-drawn curves of the human body. Lines that follow shapes rather than bones have long shaped her way of seeing. As a student specializing in art for several years, she always liked to stand up and draw, her heavy ponytail swinging regularly. Even though the models in front of her were ever-changing, in her eyes they were just objects of different shapes. After dividing arts and sciences, her grades were better than before. During the college entrance examination, I followed my parents’ wishes and applied for medical school. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;When she was painting plaster statues in the past, she had thought about how the faces of these figures from the ancient Greek period were molded and copied over and over again, and then passed down to the present era. The truth about their physical form may have been lost years ago. &quot;So it&#39;s good to study medicine, because you are dealing with a more accurate body.&quot; Rui Rui had already graduated from the Sculpture Department of the Academy of Fine Arts at that time, and rented an old factory building as a studio with his college classmates in the Wujiaochang area. I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s comforting, or if she really thinks so. Whenever Xiao Ye showed a hint of anxiety on the voice call, she would talk about her own point of view - &quot;The understanding of the rational world, not the perceptual world, should be the basis for artistic work.&quot; &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Xiao Ye and Rui Rui met on a website called Graffiti Kingdom. At that time, Rui Rui was already an illustrator with many followers, and he could support himself through commercial manuscripts during college. Xiao Ye was still a middle school student at the time, but Rui Rui didn&#39;t think she was a younger sister until her identity was revealed. They communicated from private messages on the website to Skype like real peers. It wasn&#39;t until they met for the first time that Rui Rui said with envy: &quot;Now I really know what I looked like when I was eighteen.&quot; &quot;But when they met, Xiao Ye was already twenty-four years old, and she knew Rui Rui&#39;s words were just an analogy. Rui Rui also said several times later - &quot;A person doesn&#39;t know how good she is when she is at her best.&quot; &amp;rdquo;They had a great time meeting each other for the first time. From then on, they would meet every week as long as they were not too busy. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;After graduating with a master&#39;s degree in clinical medicine, Xiao Ye entered the hospital affiliated to his university for regular training. I was originally going to go to the sports medicine department with another trained doctor, but I was suddenly assigned to the inpatient department of bone oncology surgery. The doctor&#39;s working time is the same time she goes to work. At eight o&#39;clock every day, the doctors take over the shift on time, and she officially starts her day&#39;s work. There were wailings from time to time in the ward, and the male doctor skillfully broke the patient&#39;s body. For a moment, Xiao Ye would feel that the people on the hospital bed were all Rubik&#39;s cubes with flesh and blood. However, within a month, she had reduced her sensitivity. There are many children in the bone tumor ward, and Xiao Ye often needs to cooperate with doctors to comfort them, but trained doctors are generally not qualified to intervene in specific work. What they do most is convey precautions to chemotherapy and surgery patients. Running down from ward to ward, Xiao Ye practiced speaking fluently. But I still couldn&#39;t help but lower my head every time I spoke. When I met a tall and strong male escort, I couldn&#39;t help but feel a little nervous and timid. But compared to these, she thinks writing medical records is more difficult. Her expressions were always scolded by doctors for using cumbersome words, and later they said she was too frugal in her writing and did not fully record some necessary processes. She revised it over and over again, as if she were completing her tribute to her former general teachers on paper. The bones seemed to have an image in front of her. Sometimes when she was busy until the evening, when she stood up, she felt that her back was shaking. A little loose. She pressed her right hand along the painful part of her spine, thinking about which bone she was touching. Occasionally, when she saw the face of a colleague who was changing clothes and preparing to go home, what she suddenly felt was no longer lines, but a picture composed of bones. It gave her a chill. When she was in medical school, her art training was still with her, and she even often read Leonardo da Vinci&#39;s picture albums over and over again, thinking that she was only undergoing technical art training. But now, in the hospital, she suddenly found that this feeling was far away from her. Everyone was very concrete in front of her, which summoned many physical feelings that she had forgotten. In the figuration full of details, she felt the echo deep in her heart, gradually adapted to the crowd no longer surrounded by lines and pictures, and finally discovered that she had long been an out-and-out medical worker. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;At that time, Rui Rui rarely accepted commercial manuscripts, even for series. He only personally handled a few product design projects in cooperation with enterprises every year. The studio is ready to be turned into a yoga studio. Among the two young men under his command, one girl is still following Rui Rui to help her with trivial matters at work, but her main job is as a PR for a liquor company. In an office used as a reception in the studio, several of Rui Rui’s past sculptures are still displayed. A section of wavy mountains lying on the sea level, half-rotten oranges, a hollow cardboard device hanging from the cabinet, and a white and smooth plaster hand. These early works were no longer suitable for Rui Rui&#39;s house, but she didn&#39;t want to deal with them hastily. The night before the yoga studio moved there, Xiao Ye visited and told Rui Rui, &quot;Contemporary art is actually not suitable for display.&quot; Rui Rui was dissatisfied, but immediately felt that it made sense. Together they moved them into the warehouse. Rui Rui, who is 1.79 meters tall, accidentally hit Xiao Ye&#39;s waist, but Xiao Ye immediately realized that the specific location was the hip bone. Her hands accurately crawled across the front and back of the bone and made several circles in that direction. Xiao Ye pulled Rui Rui to sit down and massaged her cervical spine as he did in the past. Since entering medical school, Xiao Ye feels that his hand strength is getting stronger every year. She could pinpoint the exact location of the bones, circling them over and over again as if searching for the body&#39;s structure. This allowed her to complete the massage well even though she didn&#39;t know the acupuncture points clearly. Although, after entering orthopedics, she realized that her strength was relatively small. She felt invisible pressure from those male doctors who could manipulate patients&#39; bodies without expression. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;You can only overcome strength with gentleness. Rui Rui once again put on her familiar teacher appearance, &quot;Assuming they are not as good at making circles as you are, assuming their familiarity with bones is about the same as yours.&quot; They surpass your hand speed and strength - if it is a kind of sharpness, then making circles on the bones should also be a kind of sharpness. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;After getting to know Rui Rui in real life, Xiao Ye watched the documentary online with her on the same channel. It tells that Leonardo da Vinci personally dissected a mammal in order to draw the female pelvis. Different structures are nested in the same body, giving a cross-sectional view of the body a unique artistic luster. Xiao Ye suddenly remembered that when he was studying, some skulls used for medical research would be marked and coded and sent to the classrooms of some art schools. If you are a mature painter, you can often find subtle differences between different skulls. But medical students like her eventually need to use their fingers to memorize the feeling of the same human bone on different patients&#39; bodies, so that they can identify it more accurately next time. She remembers by similarities, while the painter remembers by differences. She doesn&#39;t understand which one is more trustworthy, regardless of professional background. Those who walked face to face with her seemed to have slightly different shapes of bones. However, her understanding of bones still relied on the similar touches that had stayed on her fingers, so she had no chance to feel those weak bones. Differences only make each bone feel the same. For a moment, she seemed to feel that she had fallen from a world full of characteristics into an undifferentiated life, and she felt a little lost. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Two&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;A few years ago, after many During the rotation of departments, Xiao Ye finally chose neurology instead of orthopedics. Before that, she had wanted to be an anesthesiologist. Inject at the right time and watch the patient wake up from the operating table. To outsiders, it seems to be just a necessary tool in surgery. But for Xiao Ye, he is like a farmer in the fields. He is responsible for sowing and harvesting. She enjoys the seemingly repetitive work of anesthesiologists. Nor did she think it was any different than using a scalpel. But when she accidentally expressed this, she was ridiculed by her colleagues. &amp;ldquo;Have you ever taken a scalpel? &amp;rdquo;Indeed, she has never really taken risks, and even seems to only want to take on the fun of repetition, words, actions, and the accompanying psychological construction of practicing it many times. The smell of the old people in the elevator, the maturity beyond their years in the eyes of the young patients, the occasional impatience shown by some of the attendants, and the broken family members pacing back and forth in the ward who were trying to maintain peace, reminded her of Yao Mutao. In those last days - still standing in front of the big red painted iron gate where the ray of sunshine was, as if talking to myself, and as if shouting &quot;Mom, mom,&quot; to every passerby. Jingxiang Street is a remote road, facing the former county winery in one direction and the temple in the other direction. In earlier memories, that street was filled with the aroma of wine and the sound of chanting from the Buddhist temple. Two different voices always merge memories into a layer of fiction. Xiao Ye still doesn&#39;t know whether the winery is closer to home or whether the Buddhist temple is closer to home. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Yao Mutao used to be an accountant in a winery, but gradually suffered from menopausal schizophrenia after retirement. His daily expression always looks like he is angry, and he always likes to look in the direction of the intersection. Jingxiang Street was gradually widened during the urban reconstruction process and became the widest and longest road in the neighborhood. Whether you are going to a winery or a Buddhist temple, you have to pass through Jingxiang Street. Gradually, it became more lively. People from other counties and cities come to burn incense and drink wine, all speaking similar but different dialects. At a certain moment, Xiao Ye felt that Jingxiang Street was also a miniature version of the center of the universe, a small communication point and a post station. Yao Mutao&#39;s looking and hostility at the door seemed to be the joy and fear of the strangeness. But when these two colors are mixed in a patient&#39;s eyes, it becomes difficult to distinguish, and one doesn&#39;t know whether it is concern or hostility. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;At that time, Xiao Ye had not really realized that he was a member of this big family, and he did not have much emotional fluctuations in Yao Mutao&#39;s various actions. On some nights when Yao Mutao suddenly left, she even felt like she was just a spectator. But when she walked in the building of the inpatient department and saw that in some originally broken families, one person could finally stand up to take care of the patients, she suddenly felt that her memories finally had weight. The emotions that had not spilled over in the past now came to her. She seemed to be living together again with the memories of Yao Mutao&#39;s life. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;When he is not too busy, Xiao Ye will silently count the number of times he adjusts his glasses as a break. From surgery to internal medicine, from emergency department to pediatrics, each rotation was a new preparation at first. Later, although the departments were different, the work became more and more familiar to her. Although the patients he faces are different, Xiao Ye can quickly transform different experiences. When she finally decided on the department, she even felt that her previous lives were infinitely similar - at that time, she was just practicing local movements. Throughout her internship, she seemed to be recreating the study life she had followed and adhered to. The daily life on campus, which was once very difficult, turned out to be a good time like wandering in retrospect. Looking at the flesh and blood bodies in front of her, she could no longer connect them with the general appearance of the teachers lying flat. She even seemed to have stepped back onto a fork in the road of life, handing over part of the present to the past to fill or complete the younger eight years that were too compact and lacked the ability to reflect. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;When Xiao Ye’s training career ended, Rui Rui’s yoga studio that had been converted from a sculpture classroom began to open for business. Rui Rui gave her a card and asked her to sit down when she was free. But Xiao Ye has always resisted. After all, she is usually busy with work, and it is really difficult for her to exercise again. It wasn&#39;t until the card was about to expire that Xiao Ye thought of going there. It was the turn of spring and summer, and two rows of sycamore trees surrounded the yoga studio. Seven or eight women lie on their backs on yoga slings with soft legs. Inside the transparent glass walls, their bodies seemed to be covered with a layer of wax. Although when he turned his face, he felt aged, but the lightness of his body still amazed Xiao Ye. A constant insistence on youth swept away the aura of decline that Xiao Ye brought out of the hospital. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Press the doorbell, and a woman in her forties wearing tight sportswear opens the door. Her accent is somewhat Hong Kong. Xiao Ye immediately introduced himself as Rui Rui&#39;s friend. The woman enthusiastically introduced her to the store, introducing experience classes and other projects, as well as long-term students. This yoga studio mainly deals with regular customers. Previously, teachers came to teach for a long time. With the recent traffic recovery, we have the opportunity to gather some students in the classroom. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The current few students have a good foundation. Only some difficult movements still require the teacher to support the body and guide the position of exerting force before they can try it. But you can&#39;t continue doing it. You can only hang in mid-air, then turn your body down, rest for a few seconds, and then continue to adjust your body with other movements. Until the whole body is completely stretched, it will be possible to move slightly wider than before. In this cycle, the degree of what can be achieved changes. Xiao Ye stood aside and watched, suddenly feeling that the yoga practitioners in front of him were no different from the patients in the hospital. There were no lesions in their bodies, but the desire for perfection in their hearts pointed out the shortcomings of their bodies, so their bodies continued to move amidst difficulty and vague pain. When they reached the end of the studio, a male aerial yoga dancer caught Xiao Ye&#39;s attention. He was about 27 or 28 years old, his eyes were staring at the white wall in front of him, his hair was slightly long, thin, and he was wearing a headband. The skin is not very smooth, and you can see the remnants of many acne marks, giving it a rather weathered look. Xiao Ye noticed his pair of large, distinctive ears with Mephistopheles&#39; aura. The man&#39;s movements were wider than those of the other skilled women, and he seemed to have some boyish skills. When they arrived at the lounge, Xiao Ye said softly to the woman: &quot;I didn&#39;t expect men to do this.&quot; &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;That’s a lot. It&#39;s just that there aren&#39;t many people of his quality. &quot;The middle-aged woman said, &quot;He used to be a ballet student. Later he studied civil engineering and has been working in the construction engineering team since graduation. He was our resident student a few years ago and is now one of the teachers in the studio. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Xiao Ye looked at the man&#39;s twitching ears along the open door, and suddenly felt that he was thinner than before, and his figure was softer. His Adam&#39;s apple seemed to control the movement of all the bones in his body. Xiao Ye There was an urge to touch it. In order to resolve the turbulence in her heart, she pretended to withdraw money and apply for a card, and hurried out of the yoga studio. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The excitement on the road seemed new, once again breaking through the stagnation and rapids she felt just now. In an instant, she felt that life in the hospital truly suited her multiple moods and was truly real. It&#39;s not the silence that a yoga studio can create, but each family and individual actively or passively opens it up for her to see. The doctor&#39;s vision is conveyed to the patients and becomes their vision. Between looking, the boundaries of lines and bones that I once felt suddenly become blurred in my mind. She seemed to have returned to her imaginative youth moment again, standing in front of the window, watching countless figures walking past her in groups on the road - these bodies also seemed to run over her inner feelings over and over again. With this, she stood back among the crowd she was originally in. Xiao Ye remembered that when she first learned to paint, she did not use the human body frame to examine the people walking in front of her. Everyone was a collection of feelings to her, just because every feeling was different. It only occupied a moment, and she quickly forgot about it. Then, the more concrete human structure dominated the way she remembered faces and bodies. She used to think that she remembered through inscriptions, forgetting that her memories originally came only from feelings. And now that she chooses neurology, she may just go back to the way she originally remembered, using the perception of the whole as the only credible way of memory, rather than describing the details as the whole. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;When Xiao Ye told Rui Rui about his chosen path of thought, he was questioned by her. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;The patient’s pain does not start from the whole. If you think so, do you still regard them as general teachers? &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Xiao Ye was silent, but she knew that maybe she didn&#39;t express it clearly, but she didn&#39;t want to tell Rui Rui anymore. She knew that she could not convince Rui Rui yet, or even herself. Her inner sense of responsibility has indeed been awakened, but when she actually works, her inner medical ethics is not the first consideration that dominates her work. What she considers is even entirely technology. It&#39;s just that the doctors and patients she currently faces are not so technically demanding, and sometimes she even feels that she is working by inertia. After officially becoming a neurologist, she packed her luggage in the dormitory and rented an old house from the 1980s three kilometers away from the hospital. The kitchen is shared, and the bathroom and bedroom are separate. On weekends, she often needs the smell of neighbor’s rice to remind her that it’s time to eat. The mobile phone is filled with various groups, patients of different age groups, patients with similar treatment plans, and patients in urgent need of hospitalization. Every working day morning, when Xiao Ye followed the attending physician through the ward area, the eyes of the patients and some of their family members gave her a great sense of satisfaction. But even so, surgery is still far away from her, although she is not looking forward to it. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Unlike many colleagues, she seems to prefer organizing, taking notes, constantly explaining precautions to patients, and other tasks that do not seem difficult enough. Her notes were often praised by teachers in public, and she was often praised for being calm, but all this was just because she lacked initiative to go further. She would rather be arranged, or stay in a familiar position for a while. According to the general development situation, in a few years, she will also participate in formulating important treatment plans, and in a few years, she may even have her say. After studying medicine, she learned that a doctor&#39;s time seems to pass very quickly, but in fact it is very slow. Eight years of bachelor&#39;s degree and master&#39;s degree passed quickly, and the three years of formal training were also over. The hardships during it were all washed out with a soft background, and all the late nights to prepare for the competition were forgotten by her. When participating in formulating treatment plans, she often had several different cases spinning rapidly in her mind. There are more places to take responsibility for, and the requirement for concentration becomes a requirement for focus and acuity. She has gradually become like her more experienced colleagues, first sifting out the best options from the big data of experience. She understands more and more that what is truly difficult is not difficult and complicated diseases, but a large number of repetitions. Even the language used to communicate with patients is repeated over and over again, and then established and shaped. Her handwriting gradually became more and more sloppy, even simple, but the ocean of information in her mind began to surge. Sometimes, the best matching option can be automatically made without much reaction. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Once, the emergency department received a sixty-year-old woman who was confused. After the head CT was done, electroencephalography, magnetic resonance imaging, and lumbar puncture were completed. During this period, the female patient could be woken up all the time, but she could not respond normally. When she could speak, her speech was confusing, and she couldn&#39;t distinguish between subject and predicate. She kept yelling and had unreasonable quarrels with two patients in the clinic. His behavior is quite similar to that of Yao Mutao back then. Throughout the night, Xiao Ye was called over many times and spent the whole night running around upstairs and downstairs. On the afternoon of the second day, the nurse suddenly reported that the patient had cerebral hemorrhage. Feeling severe fatigue, she then attended neurology consultation again, and it was determined that the woman suffered from arteriovenous fistula malformation. After a small &quot;game&quot; between repair surgery and minimally invasive arteriography, the latter was decided on as the treatment plan. Xiao Ye&#39;s memories related to Yao Mutao were brought out by busyness.跟患者讲入院须知的时候，她语速比过去缓慢，却掷地有声，仿佛大脑中有一块黑板，她逐字逐句把要说的写上去。而这些字，也把大脑中原有的那些字挤走了，变化成更体贴的表达。肖叶这才发现，原来一定程度的缓慢，就是周全。回到办公室的时候，肖叶重新想起患者先前的举止，又觉得那和姚木桃全然不同。可为什么刚看见患者的时候会觉得那是一样的呢？或许是因为当时看到的是一个片面的形象，经过这几日，病人的完整反应才终于被她记录。想到这些，肖叶突然觉得自己对姚木桃的那些记忆，其实也是片面的。她从未获得对姚木桃整体反应的认识。而这次治疗之所以让她与记忆中的病例拉开距离，也只是她主导的全方位检查，让她拉长了对患者的认识过程，因此击破了一些先前建立的刻板认知。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;那之后，肖叶不仅对周围的人，更对自己的身体格外关心起来。做美术特长生那几年，她极少画自画像。她发现对着镜子画，很容易丢掉本质的自己，任由细节蔓延，把画面带到一个似是而非的境地，不仅常常越画越不像，还容易把自己画得有一丝像别人。跟着心里的印象画呢，又容易忽略一些细节。神态似乎像了，却也容易因此走极端，或美化，或因不知不觉强调一种特征的鲜明，而显得过于用力。在努力诠释自己的过程中，她似乎距真实的自己越来越远。可画别人的时候，就似乎没有这个问题了。她总是可以很客观，且没有负担地一点点来。就仿佛，画自己的时候，她是把内心的样子也带进去，而这个样子她来说仍有些模糊的。那几年，迎面走来的人，在肖叶眼中都是模特，都是线条包裹成的人形雕塑。肖叶总是快速就画完一个人，但能画到怎样的准确程度，却总是受制于被线条覆盖的第一印象。作为特长生参加中学生美术大赛时，肖叶画下姚木桃斜眼望着她的一幅肖像，只是她在图画背景中加入诸多细节&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;郁郁葱葱的南方雨林，草绿和翠绿交织。女性半截身体遮蔽倾斜下来的，被砍倒的树木。图画递交上去之前，美术老师批评她作品稍显投机&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;把女性和环保主题相结合。但老师也很客气地表扬她对梦境的把握，整个画面生动、艳丽，稀释了主人公阴沉的神色，因为浸润在梦中，所有鲜明的表达，就成为一种风格。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;后来，很长一段时间，想起姚木桃出现在梦境中的模样，肖叶再也不觉得后怕。尽管那层艳丽像是她给自己的记忆附着的一层保护色，但不得不说，很有用。她再也不觉得那个梦是恐怖片。直到成为医学院学生，面前的人从线条渐渐成为更实际、整体的存在，包括姚木桃在内的那些记忆，也才终于以更加客观的形式出现在她的面前。只是这两种印象，在交叠中愈发放肆，共同构成她在某一段时间内的激烈感受。随着时间的推移，第二重印象督促着第一重印象的退场。如果说，过去，她面对人体的时候，灵活的线条刺激着她内心一切可能的波动，她需得小心把它们投射在纸面上。那后来，所有的感受以更整全的样态进入她的内心生活，因完整而显出柔和。她感觉曾经的波动在冷却，变成一个个凝滞的&amp;ldquo;此刻&amp;rdquo;，她在不断切换中感受着内心的移动，也因此读取了生长芯片中真正的冷静。她内心的底色掌控着一切灵敏的感受，很多细节被隐藏，而她的感觉却更准确、清晰。她发现，走出学校后，所有的生活，所有的工作感受，都变成对前者的补全。内心的感受和学习经验的延续渐渐在生活场景中融合，两股力量的争夺战才终于平息。可是，瑜伽教室里的感触，让她觉得一种新的对身体的认识加入了进来。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;三&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;自从开始固定练习，肖叶和芮瑞就常常改在瑜伽馆见面。过去，她们仅仅就遇到的问题和具体事情交流，自那时开始，竟也聊起女性常见话题，少了一些郑重其事。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;男瑜伽舞者不是每周都来，但如果来了，就会做兼职教练。他话少，芮瑞喜欢打趣他，像曾经调侃肖叶那样。他端坐在休息室，时常释放出一阵安静气息，神色冷淡，却不似精神涣散的冷漠，而是目光集中在一处，有时候是看着面前的桌子，有时紧盯对面的人。耳朵倒不似远观时那么醒目，偶尔低头的时候竟像一对要起飞的小翅膀。肖叶得知他叫&amp;ldquo;于牧&amp;rdquo;，是一家建筑公司某部门负责人。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;最近，于牧所在公司负责的一个外地公园项目进入收尾阶段，他必须前往处理一些事，此次也是在瑜伽馆交接一下后续的工作。和许多&amp;ldquo;成功人士&amp;rdquo;一样，他也在朋友圈分享自己戴着橙色帽子的工作照。阳光打下来，他的脸被分成两边，一半是更暗的阴影，一半是透着微光的阴影。帽子模糊了两块灰色的界限，微微混合的灰色把于牧塑造出沾染风霜的模样。同时，工作服遮掩了他过于瘦削的躯体。和建筑工人站在一起，他丝毫不显得瘦弱。肖叶把那张照片放大看，那在瑜伽馆休息室仿佛无性别的面目突然显出硬朗的棱角，竟和他吊布上的身体终于融合成了一个鲜活的人了。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;肖叶加了不少瑜伽馆学员的微信。他们不像医院同事，而是在朋友圈外放地呈现着自己的身体状态。不少人都开了自己的视频号，肖叶甚至觉得，如果他们的账号是一个个播放器的话，那他们展示出来的身体，就是乐曲。她则是一个聆听外放音乐的旁观者。当她走进广场舞队伍，那这些身体也可能跟着《潇洒走一回》的步调做瑜伽；当她走进超市或电影院，那这些身体又以静止的模样反复演练着新的动作。这些动作和旧动作结合，竟像是一出在一个人身体上出现的交响乐。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;身体的变化能让人打开一个世界&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;瑜伽馆的标语一直悬挂在几个长期学员的视频号介绍栏。起初，肖叶对这种介绍十分抗拒，久而久之，竟也习惯下来。返回医院后，那些柔软的身体也常常从大脑中钻出来。肖叶突然又恢复了美术特长生时期的感知能力&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;面前走来的人是被线条包裹的血肉之躯。作为医生，她需要调动的，是身体结构中的能量。如此想着，肖叶似乎不再觉得对眼前人的印象，是分为第一印象和第二印象的。似乎，它们都成了一种印象。她的感受前赴后继地降落，似乎先于她定义了眼前的事物。那触碰患者身体的瞬间，终于和看片子、讨论方案时视觉上的对患者身体的印象，凝聚成一种感受。方案的准确似乎也像新的触摸，渐渐复归到她的指间。这种灵活感一度让肖叶感受羞耻，仿佛冒犯了医生的职业伦理，竟似用人体美学给枯燥的工作加了一层绵密的背景。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;后来，许多同事被派往各个社区做核酸检测。肖叶很快也去了一线。那段时日，眼前人的流动感比在医院的时候更茂盛了。有时，她甚至怀疑曾经在医院时，对身体的印象仅仅来源于一种禁锢感。毕竟，医院作为背景，存在感太强，早就覆盖了病患本身的特殊性。她在医院获得的对身体的感受，对身体的记忆，其实主要是医院这个背景本身赋予的。重新回到医院后，肖叶十分警惕自己对医院气氛本身的依赖感。她甚至不再觉得眼前的病患来自医院，而默认他们都是从四面八方而来。这些身体聚集在她眼前时，她似乎觉得，原来她的工作是打理一具构造严密的身体。而这些身体携带着的记忆，才是她和生活真正的交流。肖叶再次想起瑜伽馆的标语，突然觉得那也不再是一句宣传语，而是提供了另一种认识身体的角度。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;很快，随着于牧的回归，肖叶渐渐成为空中瑜伽的重度热衷者。流汗后内心的轻松感与照片中身体的轻盈感让她获得极大的满足。于牧与中年女子，给肖叶制订了严格的训练计划，但肖叶仍坚持自己的懒散训练法。休息日，她会突然不再早起，上午十点到教室，简单热身，中午在教室内用餐，然后开启一下午的魔鬼训练。大脑高度集中在几个难度动作中时，肖叶突然觉得所有对身体的记忆与印象都在消退。她甚至感觉不到面前走来的人的面目，也感觉不到他们每个人不同的身体形状，她似乎沉浸在一种既打散，又因为高度一致，显得充满共情色彩的集体之中。她常常回忆不起来那些在训练间隙走来走去的人的脸，因为他们体态相似，穿的衣服甚至也相似，年龄更是近似。而她因为也是其中一员，很难完全以旁观者的心态注视着他们。或者说，肖叶会觉得那注视着的，也是另外的她自己。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;只是，瑜伽馆也和住院部一样，中间都会有一些人离开。有的人突然怀孕生二胎，有的人突然搬迁到城市边缘的小区。新生活一降临，很难跨越大半个城市，甚至大半年的时光再次归来。肖叶一边在医院感受着一波波病人的来去，一边在瑜伽馆看着刚刚融入的集体突然因为进来新的人，仿佛缩水。她内心的感受不断移动、蔓延，进而变成某种具有超自然力量的监测器，似乎紧跟在她身后注视着她所感受到的每一个人。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;不久，芮瑞决定结束自由工作者生涯，回归职场，成为一家美术用品企业的市场总监。经常需要去办公室后，芮瑞的时间反而空出许多。她跟肖叶自嘲道：&amp;ldquo;以往在家工作，每天都是工作日，现在倒是解放了。 &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;肖叶鼓励芮瑞继续做作品。几个月间，芮瑞利用下班时间给家里做改造，把接近二分之一的空间变做作了工作室。起初只是利用零碎时间做一些架上绘画，后来渐渐又开始做手工。最后，芮瑞决定还是做雕塑。感觉渐渐上来后，芮瑞再次辞掉工作。那段时日，每次去芮瑞家，肖叶都能看到那些缩小版的人与物在灰蒙蒙的台面上生动又安静。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;这些东西还挺适合摆起来的。 &amp;rdquo;肖叶道。但芮瑞并无此意。对她来说，似乎创作只是刚刚起步，她依然在找手感。肖叶帮她把废弃的作品一筐筐往远处丢弃。正值垃圾分类推广得热火朝天，每次她们二人仍要搜索，究竟哪些废料是干垃圾。芮瑞比过去决绝，只要觉得没有达到要求的作品，全部丢弃。近一年后，留在家中的作品依然一个手掌能数得过来。而这几件留下的作品，居然还是肖叶和芮瑞一起完成的。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;春天来临前，肖叶在医院没日没夜熬过了最难的一个治疗。接着，正式辞职。和芮瑞不同，肖叶这番选择让人惊讶。但她不以为意。她已经三十一岁，却刚刚和自己的身体达成和解，适应着身体在不同场景和氛围下的样子，对其他人的身体也多了更多的包容度。她想要把这份感受凝聚一处，她需要专注做一件事。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;于牧再次出现的时候，肖叶看着他在瑜伽吊布上试图做芭蕾动作。每次都仿佛要摔下来，却又被吊布接住，形似倒立。与她和芮瑞不同，于牧一直没有辞职，依旧常常在瑜伽馆消失。芮瑞把雕塑教室开起来的时候，肖叶曾叫上于牧一道去。只是穿上便衣时，他耸动的喉结和轮廓鲜明的大耳朵似乎没有穿瑜伽服的时候那般醒目，肖叶也没有了想要触碰一下的冲动。于牧也没有了那种看起来更宁静的神色，他走在肖叶身侧，仿佛一个寻常的朋友，只是因为瘦削，体态又轻盈，显得仍与旁人不同。肖叶没有问他以后的打算，因为这不太重要。芮瑞的雕塑教室主打体验课程，但芮瑞更多是想把雕塑教室做成一个素材中心。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;我希望来来往往的人多些，他们都能在这个空间感受到自己的变化。 &amp;rdquo;芮瑞说，&amp;ldquo;但这可能是一个不太可能实现的设想。 &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;雕塑教室设在闹市区，附近有迪厅和韩式料理。来来去去的大学生，很多是外国人。有时候一个东亚人走进来，肖叶上前说汉语，对方却突然讲起英语。有一次，于牧和她一道走过泥巴掉落台面的学员作品，他突然说起自己在吊布上做芭蕾动作的那个下午。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;其实一开始我没觉得自己是想起来芭蕾舞了，我就是莫名其妙想要站起来。 &amp;rdquo;于牧道，&amp;ldquo;可是很奇怪，我站起来了，却马上好像跟瑜伽的关系更近了。我一瞬间就知道，我现在做的是瑜伽，而且我做瑜伽很开心。我好像很快就忘记跳芭蕾的时候，我是怎么感受自己的身体的。甚至那时候有人说我&amp;lsquo;娘&amp;rsquo;，我再想起来，都一点不生气了。 &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;春天来临的时候，芮瑞在做好的作品支架前反复调整，教室迎来不少陌生的体验课学生。芮瑞把他们和各自的资料一一对应，接着一边讲自己的作品，一边示意肖叶可以在支架上挂满泥巴。这个过程，肖叶自己觉得很像挂圣诞树。虽然，她从未挂过一棵圣诞树。毕竟，井巷街也好，医学院也好，医院也好，都不适合一个人做一棵圣诞树。有一年，她因为核酸问题滞留在上海，芮瑞因为一个项目没有完成，于牧则因为所在公司经营不善，等待可能的裁员信息。他和过去一样十分淡定，平静到肖叶觉得他像是一尊雕塑。只是那时候，她自己没想过会有一天和芮瑞一起做雕塑作品。她只是静静地看着于牧的侧脸。她发现，离近看的时候，于牧的外部轮廓特征似乎更明显了，却也突然让她感到亲切。肖叶很喜欢靠近于牧坐着的感受，却也并没有非分之想。当她试图伸手调整小彩灯的位置时，于牧伸手扶了一下她的腰。那一瞬间，肖叶忘记了那块骨头的名称。
