You look at each other more and more dissatisfied day by day, and finally submit a failing report to each other. Transcript. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;So, can love really be your safe haven? &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;1. What kind of love can be called a &quot;safe haven&quot;? &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;When you expect a relationship to be a safe haven, what exactly do you expect? &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Is it comfort when you are frustrated, companionship when you are lonely, encouragement when you are depressed, and empathy when you are sad? Or maybe there&#39;s more? &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The concept of&lt;strong>;&amp;ldquo;&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Supportive Partner&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong>; proposed by Cramer, a researcher at Loughborough University in the UK, seems to be in line with what most people imagine as &amp;ldquo; &quot;Safe Haven&quot;. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;Cramer mainly investigated people&#39;s evaluation of the following dimensions of their partners:&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Emotional support: Being able to comfort you when you are depressed. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Experience in getting along: It’s a pleasure to get along with. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Life support: can help you with housework. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Financial support: I can lend you money when you are in trouble. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Guidance and advice: can give you good guidance and teach you how to do something. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;In addition, the frequency and intensity of conflicts in love, the degree of satisfaction with the relationship, and the degree of depression in life of these people were also measured. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;It turns out that there are indeed some partners who can obtain very high scores in these five dimensions, that is, they become a &quot;safe haven&quot; for partners. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;This kind of &quot;supportive partner&quot; can allow you to have less conflict, higher relationship satisfaction, and lower depression in your relationship. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Specifically: &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;a. When you feel stressed, he or she will provide support to reduce your fear and loneliness, and encourage you to face it. Address problems instead of shrinking back. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;b. They work hard to prevent conflicts from escalating and proactively resolve them. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;c. They will strive to provide you with a positive experience and increase the emotional intimacy of the relationship. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;In addition, they will be more tolerant, more empathic, easier to compromise with you, and more respectful to you. Much respect...&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;It is really ideal and beautiful! &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;2. Expecting the other person to be your safe haven will lead to disappointment&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;Since safe haven lovers are real, why do we never seem to meet them? &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;One reason is: even if you encounter it, you may not recognize it. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Supportive partners are not perfect, and they will have their own emotions and troubles. It&#39;s not that he won&#39;t have conflicts, he&#39;s just better at resolving conflicts. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;And the person around you may have been denied the status of a &quot;supportive partner&quot; and lost the qualification to be a safe haven because of an occasional emotional outage. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;In addition, there is another paradox:&lt;strong>;The more you expect your lover to be your safe haven, the more likely you will be disappointed. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;In fact, whether it is &quot;striving for stability&quot; or treating marriage as a safe haven, these are unreasonable expectations in intimate relationships. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Psychologist John Gottman once said: &quot;Every marriage requires effort to stay on track.&quot; &amp;rdquo;To just want to get without making any effort is to have unreasonable expectations, which in most cases will lead to the derailment of the relationship. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;In other words, &lt;strong>;You like spending time with her, but can you accept spending money with her? &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;3. Who wants to take shelter? Sheltering and staying safe are mutually exclusive&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;It is difficult to meet a supportive partner. Even if you do, you will find that he or she has various qualities. Shortcomings. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Psychologist Dweck mentioned two modes of thinking in love in his book &quot;Lifelong Growth&quot;:&lt;strong>;Fixed thinking and growth thinking. &lt;/strong>;Understanding these two modes of thinking may help you get a better &quot;safe haven&quot;. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;People with a fixed mindset will feel that their own characteristics, the characteristics of their partners, and their romantic relationships are all fixed. There are only two categories of any relationship: &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot;. If a relationship requires effort to change, then it means that the relationship is not good and the lover is not suitable. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;People with a fixed mindset are often the ones who are unwilling to work hard in intimate relationships. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;If you find that you fit this fixed mindset perfectly. And that&#39;s okay, because simply being aware of your thought patterns can make a huge difference in your relationship. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;When you learn to view yourself, your lover, and your relationship from a dynamic perspective, and believe that both of you will change in a positive direction, then you have a growth mindset. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;When people with a growth mindset encounter problems, they will focus more on the problem itself and explore feasible solutions instead of blaming the other person or blaming themselves. &lt;/strong>;In this growth mindset, both you and your partner will grow into better people, and your relationship will become deeper and more stable. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;But one point should also be emphasized here: &quot;Believing that your partner will change&quot; and &quot;thinking that your partner will definitely change&quot; are two completely different concepts. The former is a belief that your partner has the potential to grow, while the latter is a very passive and unreasonable expectation. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;If you start a relationship with the expectation of being cured, and think you can be cured without doing anything, then you will definitely leave disappointed. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;If you always want the other person to change and make the other person a safe haven, but never give the other person the corresponding love and tolerance, then the change you are looking forward to I&#39;m afraid it will never happen, and it will be difficult for him to become your ideal safe haven. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Changes are mutual. When a strong wind comes, we must avoid it together. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;/p>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;Editor in charge: Zhou Ziheng onewenti@wufazhuce.com&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Please see @ONE Studio’s pinned Weibo for information on the call for papers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Respondent&lt;/p>; &lt;hr/>; &lt;table>; &lt;tr>; &lt;td style=&quot;width: 50px;&quot;>; &lt;img src=&quot;http://image.wufazhuce.com/FrAgJlwkHJ83vofVTBgwOc1o1VK -&quot; alt=&quot;Simple Psychology&quot;>; &lt;/td>; &lt;td>; &lt;div>;Simple Psychology&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10px&quot;>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div style=&quot;&quot;>; Committed to providing high-quality psychological services and content. &lt;/div>; &lt;/td>; &lt;td width=&quot;60px&quot;>; &lt;!-- &lt;span onclick=&quot;OneAPP.openDetail(4, )&quot;>;Follow&lt;/span>; -->; &lt;/td>; &lt;/tr>; &lt;/table>; &lt;p>;Related recommendations&lt;/p>; &lt;hr/>; &lt;table>; &lt;tr>; &lt;td style=&quot;width: 40px;&quot;>; &lt;span>;Question and Answer&lt;/span>; &lt;/td>; &lt;td>; &lt; a href=&quot;/question/3851&quot; data-ajax=&quot;false&quot;>; &lt;div>;What is &quot;suicidal singleness&quot;? &lt;/div>; &lt;div style=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/div>; &lt;/a>; &lt;/td>; &lt;/tr>; &lt;tr>; &lt;td style=&quot;width: 40px;&quot;>; &lt;span>;Q&amp;A&lt;/span>; &lt; /td>; &lt;td>; &lt;a href=&quot;/question/3987&quot; data-ajax=&quot;false&quot;>; &lt;div>;Where are you and how are you doing lately? &lt;/div>; &lt;div style=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/div>; &lt;/a>; &lt;/td>; &lt;/tr>; &lt;tr>; &lt;td style=&quot;width: 40px;&quot;>; &lt;span>;Q&amp;A&lt;/span>; &lt; /td>; &lt;td>; &lt;a href=&quot;/question/3985&quot; data-ajax=&quot;false&quot;>; &lt;div>;Friends who are over 30, have the problems that troubled you during adolescence been solved? &lt;/div>; &lt;div style=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/div>; &lt;/a>; &lt;/td>; &lt;/tr>; &lt;/table>; &lt;table>; &lt;tr>; &lt;td>;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align:center ;padding:5px;&quot; onclick=&quot;OneAPP.openDetail(4,3986)&quot;>;Click to download ONE app&lt;/div>;&lt;/td>; &lt;/tr>; &lt;/table>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 24 Nov 2023 06:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[杏色卫衣]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://m.wufazhuce.com/article/6174]]><description>&lt;div>;24 Nov. 2023&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;main&quot;>; &lt;div>; &lt;p>;Article A or B&lt;/p>; &lt;div>; &lt;p>;&lt;div contenteditable=&quot;false&quot;>;&lt; img data-author=&quot;&quot; data-original-src=&quot;http://image.wufazhuce.com/FvFKSnyLnycGgz41qp8MwBC9hAfB&quot; data-source=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://image.wufazhuce.com/FvFKSnyLnycGgz41qp8MwBC9hAfB&quot;>;&lt;/ div>;&lt;div>;&lt;div style=&quot;font-size:26px;line-height: 1;&quot;>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;The train stopped at Dezhou Station. Ma Guoqiang, who was breathing on the platform, mistakenly boarded the opposite train. The girl wearing the same sweatshirt recognized her girlfriend He Xiaonan. But he later analyzed that it was not a girl who looked very much like He Xiaonan, but the only He Xiaonan he was familiar with in the world. &lt;br>;Why does love seem to quietly deteriorate when marriage is approaching? Is it the growth of age or the prolongation of searching? Perhaps everyone can only find the answer by themselves. &lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;While waiting for the bus, He Xiaonan showed Ma Guoqiang a short video she had just seen. To be precise, it was a photo album with music. There are nine wedding photography photos in the album, and the theme written in artistic calligraphy is added to the lower left corner of each photo: past and present lives. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The photos include group photos of the groom and the bride as well as individual photos. He Xiaonan said that she likes the first two the most. One shows the newlyweds wearing Ming Dynasty-style wedding clothes and striding towards the city under the vermilion city wall. The other party is trying to overcome the eternal distance between people. The gorgeous red robe is embroidered with dragons and phoenixes, broken branches, bunches of flowers, and pedicles, showing the heroic atmosphere of the great power of the Celestial Dynasty and the freedom and richness of personal life. The groom wore a hairpin and black gauze on his head, and the bride&#39;s gold hijab was blown up by the wind, revealing the side of her face. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;In another picture, the newlyweds are wearing modern suits and wedding dresses, sitting face to face on a boat, the groom is rowing the oar of life, and the bride is smiling and dressing up. Their reflections were reflected on the water, they were in the same posture, but they looked like they were wearing Ming wedding clothes. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Does it look good? &amp;rdquo;He Xiaonan asked. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&quot;It&#39;s flashy,&quot; Ma Guoqiang said that he prefers the sci-fi style, &quot;Can they shoot a space-themed movie?&quot; Change the ancient costumes into space suits, and change the background of the ancient city wall to IC1805. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;What 1805?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;A heart-shaped nebula, 7,500 light-years away from us. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;According to your wishes, the boat in the photo should also be replaced by a spaceship. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Yes. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;What’s right?&amp;rdquo; He Xiaonan put away her fake smile and said with disdain, &amp;ldquo;Return to the space suit&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;Does anyone wear that thing to take wedding photos? We are not comedians. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Ma Guoqiang put his fingers together and touched the stubble on his chin, but did not continue to argue with her. They have no plans to get married in the near future. I don&#39;t know why, whenever people who are in love talk about marriage, it&#39;s like people who are dying talk about death. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The K1984 train from Nantong to Jilin started checking tickets and departed on time at 9:52 am. He Xiaonan said she was thirsty as soon as she got in the car, picked up her &quot;smart temperature display&quot; thermos cup, and stretched her neck to look for the water dispenser. The so-called intelligent temperature display means that a thermometer is added to the cup lid to test the water temperature in real time. Ma Guoqiang took the thermos cup and said, let me go. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Two minutes later, hot water came, but He Xiaonan tilted her head and fell asleep against the curtain. She didn&#39;t respond, and her eyelids were stuck together like her face. Ma Guoqiang put the thermos cup on the corner of the table, sat down and looked at the steam rising in the sun, feeling that he could no longer hold it any longer. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;In the past month, except for Sundays, they all went to bed at this time, slept until seven o&#39;clock in the evening, got up to wash up, and went to the garment factory to work the night shift. In their view, apart from being able to settle wages on a piece-rate basis, a garment factory is not much different from a prison. They step on the sewing machine, line up for meals, and continue to return to the work station to work on the sewing machine. Taking a single day off is like relaxing, and a short long vacation is for medical parole. They will be fired in the off-season. , probably like being released from prison. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;At noon, He Xiaonan woke up once. The uncle sitting opposite was slurping instant noodles with pickled pepper and bamboo shoot strips. There was too much movement. She smelled the greasy smell and didn&#39;t feel hungry at all. She only drank the water in the thermos cup. Ma Guoqiang woke up when the train stopped at Yangzhou Station. People queuing in the aisle intentionally or unintentionally bumped into the suitcase he was lying on. He made a &quot;tsk&quot; sound and stuffed the suitcase into his seat with all his strength. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;At 3:48 in the afternoon, when the train slowly left Bengbu Station, both of them woke up hungry. They had eaten instant noodles, one watched Korean dramas, and the other played games. At dusk, we entered Xuzhou territory and fell asleep again. He Xiaonan didn&#39;t take off his earphones. After finishing one episode of the Korean drama on his phone, it automatically played the next episode. When the advertisement for the Venetian Macao came out, he didn&#39;t know how to fast forward. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;At eleven o&#39;clock in the evening, the flight attendant loudly reminded everyone that the station ahead was Dezhou Station. Ma Guoqiang couldn&#39;t remember how many times he woke up. Looking around, he saw another batch of unfamiliar faces. He Xiaonan had put away her mobile phone, but her earphones fell to the ground. Ma Guoqiang helped her pick them up and then found a screenshot of the train timetable. The stop at this stop lasted a full twenty-one minutes. He stood up in advance to stretch his arms and legs, preparing to go out for some air. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;There was another train parked on the opposite track. Ma Guoqiang stood between the long and narrow platforms 2 and 3, stroking his sore cervical vertebrae and slowly raising his head. Although the Mid-Autumn Festival will be in half an hour, the night sky is covered with clouds, not to mention the thousands of miles apart, not a single star can be seen. Not just tonight, it seemed like he hadn&#39;t seen the sky full of stars for a long time. He walked back and forth and searched for the reason on his mobile phone. One answer goes like this:&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;When the artificial light sources in an area are turned off momentarily (such as a large-scale power outage), when we look up, we will find that the stars have never left. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;In the bright car, He Xiaonan was also awake and was plugging the data cable into the power bank. Didn&#39;t she say she forgot to bring her power bank? Ma Guoqiang thought to himself that he might have found it by accident. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Whenever she lowers her head slightly, He Xiaonan&#39;s side face will be blocked by her thick long hair, but the loose apricot sweatshirt makes her like a bulky polar bear with nowhere to hide. The sweatshirt was extremely thick. When walking on the street in winter, Ma Guoqiang often put his hand under the hood to keep warm. But now this month, he is still wearing half-sleeves, and He Xiaonan has already put on a sweater. Most girls are afraid of the cold. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;A tall policeman passed by He Xiaonan, stood behind the sliding door, and slammed it shut. Ma Guoqiang had no time to react. The next second, the train started slowly. In the windows, rows of passengers wearing clothes with different colors, styles and seasons were inspected by him. He symbolically followed the train for a few steps, a few meaningless steps, and then could only watch its last stanza, like the last sentence of a poem or novel, reminding you that it&#39;s time to go back and understand everything that has happened. . &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;When he heard the message tone on his mobile phone, Ma Guoqiang&#39;s first reaction was that it was from He Xiaonan. However, after unlocking it with his fingerprint, he only found a satisfaction survey text message from China Mobile. He wanted to take the initiative to contact He Xiaonan, but the thought was fleeting - let&#39;s see when she contacts him. The most important thing at the moment is to find a staff member to explain the situation. I heard that you can take the next train for free. He continued to stay on the platform for a while, checking the next train to Cangzhou, K702. It arrived an hour and a half later, and there were enough tickets left. Even if he couldn&#39;t make up the ticket, he could get home with another eighteen and a half yuan. He put away his mobile phone and walked slowly towards the exit of the station. When he reached the fifth step, he found that in the train opposite that had not yet left, a girl wearing the same sweatshirt as He Xiaonan was sleeping on a small table. In the corner is her &quot;intelligent temperature display&quot; thermos cup. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Ma Guoqiang walked into the car and unscrewed the lid of the thermos cup. There was only a little water left in it. He found the water heater at the junction of the carriages and filled it up for He Xiaonan. He came back and sat next to her. He wanted to say that there was a woman on the opposite train who had matched clothes with you. Then he felt that there was no need to pay for something that could be said or left unsaid. The episode woke her up, so she took out her phone and started playing quietly. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;When the battery logo in the upper right corner of the screen quietly turned red, he once again remembered that neither he nor He Xiaonan had brought a power bank. He turned around and saw the corner of his mobile phone exposed from the pocket of his apricot sweater. He used his thumb and He pinched it with his index finger, slowly pulled it out, and lit up the locked screen. The battery was running low, with seven percent left. The screen saver is still a group photo of them, taken in the Shell Lake Scenic Area in their hometown in September last year. In October, the two of them got on the K1983, which was traveling in the opposite direction to the K1984, and went to a clothing factory in Nantong for an interview. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;On the six o&#39;clock train that morning, Ma Guoqiang set the alarm for 4:20, went to the opposite side of the community and ate seven fried buns, and took the 920 bus to Cangzhou Station. He Xiaonan had arrived a while earlier and waved to him in the waiting area. He pulled his suitcase up to greet him. Later, the train left Cangzhou in the morning light. The clanking sound of the wheels passing through the gap in the rails was like the gentle patting of a baby, and He Xiaonan&#39;s whispers were like a lullaby, coaxing Ma Guoqiang to sleep for nearly two hours. Coincidentally, when he woke up at 7:55, the train also stopped at Dezhou Station, but unlike K1984 that took them back home, K1983 that took them away only stayed at this station for three minutes. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;He Xiaonan, who was originally sitting on the inside, has gone somewhere. On the corner of the table is the new &quot;smart temperature display&quot; thermos cup she bought before departure, proving that she has indeed accompanied her on this journey. journey. Ma Guoqiang clicked on the first number in his address book and called twice without getting through. He stood up and looked at the end of the car. The red indicator light showed that the toilet was occupied. I knocked on the door and heard another woman&#39;s voice. He continued to knock on two toilet doors, but it was still not He Xiaonan. He couldn&#39;t help but cursed. I won&#39;t tell you what he was scolding, but it was pretty vicious anyway. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;When Ma Guoqiang returned to his carriage, he happened to see He Xiaonan coming from the other end carrying a bucket of instant noodles. Most of his anger was gone, but he was still unhappy. After He Xiaonan sat down, he asked him if he was hungry. He waved his hand and turned to look at the fleeting mountains and rivers at night without saying anything. He Xiaonan saw something was wrong and asked him openly, &quot;Why are you so depressed?&quot; He didn&#39;t know how to answer. He Xiaonan did nothing wrong except not saying hello when leaving. It&#39;s all parting when you&#39;re in love, no matter how long or short it is, the result is uneasy waiting. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;One year later, the situation has changed. Just now, Ma Guoqiang watched the girl who looked like He Xiaonan leave him on the opposite train. His boundless peace seemed to be able to endure a longer separation. He couldn&#39;t fool himself by saying that I had just gotten off the train and was confused and saw the wrong thing, because he clearly remembered that in his understanding at the time, it was not a passerby wearing the same apricot-colored sweatshirt as He Xiaonan. , but the only He Xiaonan he is familiar with in the world. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;He rubbed the furry surface of his sweatshirt and forced himself to think back to last year when he was wandering helplessly in three carriages, whose eyes he suddenly saw, and who rescued him. The person he was looking for at that time was He Xiaonan, but now he is looking for himself, the fragile self whose heart is full of love. He knocked on the door of time one after another, hoping to hear a firm voice, but in the end he still got those four words: The situation has changed. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;It used to be forever, but now I don’t know. Ma Guoqiang doesn’t know how much time they have left together. In short, he can’t waste every minute and second anymore. Using a similar gentle technique, he stuffed He Xiaonan&#39;s phone back and patted it on the sweater seven or eight times. He Xiaonan woke up from a hibernating sleep, with blank eyes as if looking at a stranger. Ma Guoqiang looked at her forehead, which had a red mark, and said with a smile: &quot;Stop sleeping, you&#39;ve slept for too long.&quot; &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;He Xiaonan straightened his arms, stretched them into the gap between his thighs, and relaxed his back muscles as much as possible. Then he straightened his back and turned on his mobile phone to calculate the remaining time. Ma Guoqiang said, let me look at that set of wedding photos, the one taken in plain wedding clothes. He Xiaonan said, &quot;What are you looking at that for now?&quot; ” But he clicked on Kuaishou with his thumb and called up the photo in the collection list. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Ma Guoqiang took the phone and looked through every photo again. He felt more and more that Ming Dynasty wedding clothes were more appropriate than astronaut suits, and ancient style was more romantic than science fiction. In the future, humans can freely travel back and forth to the heart-shaped nebula 7,500 light-years away, and they can live a long time, even forever. Although eternal life is a great initiative, it is not without its drawbacks. For those who live forever, missing means forever searching, and as long as you are sad, there will be endless tears. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;We don’t want to go that far and limit it to the next ten years. Optimistically assuming that we wear red robes and ascend to the great hall amid the joy of the dynasty, we will not win everything. Wage and tax burdens, tedious housework, our respective futures and physical and mental health, support for the elderly, children&#39;s education, the close combat within a small family and the ideological dispute between the two original families behind it, and even changes in public opinion on marriage in society, all try to separate us. People often say that it is difficult to look back on the past, but in fact it is difficult to look forward to the future. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Looking back at the wedding photos with the theme of &quot;past and present life&quot;, the crimson and green of the Ming Dynasty&#39;s wedding clothes conveyed another kind of open-minded mood - even though the Ming Dynasty has been destroyed. Three hundred and seventy-nine years have passed, and what the photographer wants to talk about is the love that began at that time. In these three hundred and seventy-nine years, no matter how many past lives the hero and heroine have had, this life is the next life. No matter how many humiliations, how many meaningless struggles, sacrifices for love and looking back at each other, they are together at this moment, and they are all those who have no life at this moment. The ending in the minds of those who see the ending. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The train restarts and the next stop is Cangzhou Station. The nearly fifteen-hour drive was obviously very difficult. Seeing the end in sight, I felt that it was nothing more than that. I even said that it would be completely acceptable to arrive at the station an hour or two slower. Ma Guoqiang quit Kuaishou and returned the phone to He Xiaonan. When He Xiaonan saw that the battery dropped to 5%, he didn&#39;t dare to play anymore. After turning off the screen, he nestled on Ma Guoqiang&#39;s shoulder in boredom. At the same time, as the clouds continued to drift, a little halo appeared in the originally dark sky. Looking down from there, the carriages under the night sky are like meteors, crossing the North China Plain one by one.
