Noise, I can tolerate myself who is regarded as the bottom trash by doing nothing. For every migrant worker in a foreign land, the only thing that can be with him at all times and respond to everything is a mobile phone and the voice assistant in the mobile phone. &lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;1.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;At five o’clock in the morning, the sound of &quot;咿咿Ah&quot; came from upstairs as scheduled &quot;Yeah&quot; is as punctual as the news broadcast every night. It is far less meaningful than the news broadcast. You can&#39;t tell from this voice whether the Russian army or Ukraine won the war today. From a humanistic perspective, it is far more meaningful than the news broadcast. News broadcast is meaningful. Zhang Huaiming said that he could gain insight into the origin of life. The human machine has always been accompanied by such sounds since its birth. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;So when Zhang Huaiming was woken up again, he was not as angry as usual, but just used a vague voice to wake up Siri on the pillow. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Siri, turn on timer. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Okay, the timer has been turned on for you. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Siri is no different from human beings. Most of the time, Zhang Huaiming feels that he is not as good as Siri. At least Siri has the right to say: &quot;Sorry, the app was not found.&quot; &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;But Zhang Huaiming cannot do that. When his parents ask him how his job is, he cannot say: &quot;Sorry, I didn&#39;t find the job.&quot; &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Of course, there are many things that Zhang Huaiming can do that Siri cannot replace. As far as delivering food, Siri can only open maps, but Zhang Huaiming can open up the traffic police’s narrow understanding of the speed of electric vehicles. She was forced by her mother to be objective. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Strictly speaking, it was the 200,000 gift from her mother. Before Zhang Huaiming came to Hangzhou, he patted his chest in front of her mother and said that he would definitely marry her back this year. At that moment, he felt like a man. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The movement upstairs gradually subsided, and the high-pitched moans turned into the sound of running water. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Zhang Huaiming picked up his phone, clicked on the familiar avatar, and said to the lit screen in a slightly hoarse voice just after waking up: &quot;That guy only lasted 5 minutes and 36 seconds today.&quot; &quot;Siri&#39;s weak light imprinted on Zhang Huaiming&#39;s naughty but gentle face, illuminating his stubborn beard. In a city of one person, Siri is more important than people.&quot; &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The message was at 6:15. There was no voice, it was a series of cold words. Those words that Zhang Huaiming thought would sting him did not cause too much trouble in his heart. Instead, it was that sentence. : &quot;Zhang Huaiming, you are absolutely boring.&quot; &amp;rdquo;This made him want to cry. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Boring? When Zhang Huaiming, who woke up at 7 o&#39;clock, wanted to explain the word &quot;boring&quot;, several red exclamation marks appeared on the screen, and then only a &quot;bang&quot; and the sentence &quot;bang&quot; were heard in the room. Damn it”, subjective. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Zhang Huaiming picked up the mobile phone with the screen almost separated from the body and called the webmaster. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;I won’t run today, I want to take a rest. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;A man&#39;s mean voice came from the phone: &quot;How many times have I told you to ask for leave in advance? If you don&#39;t come, you won&#39;t get the salary for these two days. You can weigh it yourself.&quot; &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Get the hell out of here! &amp;rdquo;Zhang Huaiming almost couldn&#39;t resist causing secondary damage to Siri, but after seeing its broken state, he still didn&#39;t do it. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Zhang Huaiming did not rest. He lay on the bed and stared at the ceiling, thinking about why he was in this small, cramped room. He could not figure it out. The toilet in the cubicle not far away started to pour water again. Zhang Huaiming didn&#39;t want to care. He wrapped his head in a quilt, like a general who was about to be captured by the enemy. After launching a failed charge, he was lost in the water. In a dungeon in a foreign land. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;2.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;At four o&#39;clock in the afternoon, Zhang Huaiming finally went downstairs. What drove him downstairs was not hunger. It was the last cigarette in the damn cigarette case. He had been smoking the five-yuan Hongmei for three years. Zhang Huaiming said that the taste of Hongmei and Huazi were very similar. They were just different tobaccos. Some of the leaves were lucky enough to grow close to the sun and were made into flowers worth sixty yuan a pack, while some were not so lucky and accidentally grew on the roots, thus becoming five yuan in the hands of Zhang Huaiming. of red plums. &quot;But it doesn&#39;t matter,&quot; he said, &quot;I need red plums.&quot; &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;You don’t need to envy the rich, you should envy the happy people. The red plums on his fingertips are very happy, he said. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Zhang Huaiming rarely communicates with people in this city. The person who communicates most face-to-face is the cashier of the convenience store downstairs. Later, I visited more often, and the cashier stopped talking. Every time Zhang Huaiming came by, he would habitually take out a pack of red plums from the cigarette rack with a &quot;I understand you&quot; smile on his face. But Zhang Huaiming didn&#39;t like this understanding. He wanted the cashier to ask him seriously: &quot;What do you need?&quot; &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;When the cashier took out the red plums again, Zhang Huaiming waved his hands like some kind of compromise and surrender. He said, &quot;Bring me a bag of Huazi.&quot; &quot;Maybe he doesn&#39;t need Hongmei as much as he thought, because of her mother.&quot; &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;He took out his mobile phone and prepared to scan the code, but the shattered mobile phone did not light up again this time. He called Siri, and Siri said: &quot;I&#39;m here.&quot; &amp;rdquo;This made him feel surprisingly at ease. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Huazi can no longer be bought. If you want to buy Huazi, you must first repair your mobile phone, Zhang Huaiming thought. Then he took out five dollars and put it on the table: &quot;Forget it, it&#39;s still the same.&quot; &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;He hurriedly took out a cigarette, lit it, took a deep breath, and walked quickly towards the alley. He would pass by this mobile phone repair shop every day when delivering food, but He has never gone in once. He protected Siri very well. This time it was force majeure. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The little brother took the phone and glanced at it and said: &quot;We have to change the screen.&quot; &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Can’t we use the original one? &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;The inner screen is broken and needs to be replaced. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Is this the only way? &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;If you like it, change it or leave it, there is so much nonsense. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;He is not romantic at all, Zhang Huaiming thought. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;After 0.01 seconds of struggle, Zhang Huaiming finally gave in to reality, and his own broken heart was replaced along with the screen. He hated the loving couple upstairs a little, and he was wondering if if he didn&#39;t say this, he wouldn&#39;t need to change the screen. He shook his head and felt that his thoughts were a bit boring. Now that his mother didn&#39;t have to force him, he could smoke Huazi, go to restaurants, and go shopping... Forget it was illegal, Zhang Huaiming thought. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;3.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;At five o&#39;clock in the afternoon, Zhang Huaiming walked into a Shaxian snack shop. He suddenly remembered that he had not eaten all day. When it comes to eating, he feels that there is no need to do this. Eating well is far more important than thinking about why. Why can&#39;t you fill your stomach? It will only disturb your mood. Zhang Huaiming ordered his favorite duck leg rice set. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;After the dinner plate was served, Zhang Huaiming saw a fly standing on his favorite duck leg as if no one else was around, wiggling its buttocks, as if declaring sovereignty, it used its tail to insert its own fly into the duck leg. The flag, with its wings vibrating, flew proudly to its next destination. That scene reminded Zhang Huaiming of Armstrong who landed on the moon. This is one small step for a fly, but one giant leap for a new life. It turns out that not only human beings, but the birth of all life is accompanied by the sound of &quot;beep, bab, bab&quot;, Zhang Huaiming thought. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Zhang Huaiming asked the waiter to change it for him. He said: &quot;There are flies crawling on the duck legs.&quot; &amp;rdquo;The waiter said he was poor and particular. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Zhang Huaiming lost his appetite, stood up and left. No one cared whether Zhang Huaiming left, and no one cared whether the things sold were eaten. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Zhang Huaiming said: &amp;ldquo;Siri, go to a high-end restaurant nearby. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Siri gave him 20 options, which made Zhang Huaiming very happy. At least Siri would care about his choices. At 5:11 in the afternoon, Zhang Huaiming came to a beautifully decorated Western restaurant. The enthusiastic waiter at the door helped him open the door of the restaurant. The front desk looked at Zhang Huaiming with a smile and asked him how many people there were. Zhang Huaiming looked back at the empty restaurant in surprise. Behind him, &quot;Guess&quot;, Zhang Huaiming said. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;After Zhang Huaiming sat down, the waiter bent down with the menu, stood beside Zhang Huaiming and said softly: &quot;Look, what do you want to order?&quot; &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;For this sentence, Zhang Huaiming spent a month&#39;s living expenses on ordering the most expensive set meal in the store. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;This is the first time since he came to this city that someone has asked him what he needs. It&#39;s nice to have money, he thought. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Looking at the dazzling array of food on the table, he suddenly felt sorry for her unborn child. Zhang Huaiming subconsciously picked up the rosemary used to garnish the steak and saw it falling outside the dinner plate. , he suddenly realized that maybe the child did not want to come to this world. Not even qualified to be eaten. It’s so boring and ordinary, he thought. Zhang Huaiming patted his face and stopped thinking. He cut the steak in front of him and stuffed it into his mouth. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;It’s really expensive. &amp;rdquo;He said. He put the rosemary he had just picked out into his mouth with a fork. It was a bit bitter, just like today. He remembered a book he had read before, which said: &quot;Medieval Christianity believed that heaven should be sprinkled with spices. Spices are the bridge connecting the world and heaven, so spices were as expensive as gold at that time.&quot; &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;It turns out that he was born at the wrong time and in the wrong place, he thought. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;4.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;At 8:30 in the afternoon, Zhang Huaiming was walking aimlessly on the street alone. He was very familiar with the streets of the city. His shoes were clearly on the ground, but he felt like he had nowhere to stay. The passers-by were all busy in their own way, and no one noticed that it was raining above Zhang Huaiming. He could not avoid it, and the dark clouds were just above his head. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;There seemed to be an unknown thing holding in his chest. Zhang Huaiming couldn&#39;t tell what it was. He wanted to shout. He expected someone to notice the dark clouds above his head and pat him. He was not being generous. shoulders. Zhang Huaiming put his left hand on his right shoulder, trying to find that feeling. The rain fell even harder. He walked around the entire shopping mall and the entire pedestrian street, and at a glance he saw passers-by with their heads lowered and holding mobile phones. They looked as tired as Zhang Huaiming. If someone talks to me, I will definitely treat him to the most expensive set menu in a Western restaurant, he thought. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;This kind of wandering is not completely meaningless. Zhang Huaiming finally met someone who took the initiative to chat. She was a beautiful girl, stylishly dressed, and her fiery red hair was very eye-catching. The last time he saw such red hair It’s still the blush on the face of the village gong and drum team aunt. Sure enough, women all like gorgeous ones, no matter what age they are, he thought. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The red-haired girl stopped him and handed him a black card and said: &quot;Zebra Club, let&#39;s find out.&quot; &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Zhang Huaiming, who had never passed Level 4, didn’t understand what the flash of kabuda meant. He thought of a small deformed toy he played when he was a child that could transform his head from his buttocks. If only I could have a head like it, even one coming out of my butt, he thought. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;What the hell? &amp;rdquo;he asked. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;The newly opened bar is holding activities now. Are you interested, handsome guy? &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Zhang Huaiming has never been to a bar. He doesn’t drink often, but the dark clouds above his head seem to be in need of alcohol. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Lead the way. &amp;rdquo;He said. These two words gave him the feeling that he could influence the direction of some major event. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Zhang Huaiming often passed by this place when he was delivering food, but he didn’t know what it was doing, just like he didn’t know why the bar had the same name as Tiejia Xiaobao, and he wasn’t curious either. The 200,000 gift from her mother was all he needed to worry about. Zhang Huaiming asked the red-haired girl: &quot;How much is the most expensive package here?&quot; &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;A golden light flashed in the red-haired girl&#39;s eyes. She grabbed Zhang Huaiming&#39;s arm and pressed her against him. Her movements were so skillful that Zhang Huaiming thought they had known each other since they were children. The last one pressed against him like this. The girl said this morning that he was boring, childish, unable to see results and inappropriate. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Dragon set, eighty-eight thousand. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Zhang Huaiming suspected that there was something wrong with his ears. &amp;ldquo;How much? &amp;rdquo;he asked. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Eighty-eight thousand. &amp;rdquo;The girl said firmly. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Would drinking gold cause metal poisoning? &amp;rdquo;He said. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;It&#39;s champagne,&amp;rdquo; she said, &amp;ldquo;they all use it to wash their hands. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Zhang Huaiming didn’t speak. There was something wrong that he couldn’t explain. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;You can order a bottle of Ace of Spades for eight thousand eight, and I can give you a fruit plate and other drinks. ’ she said. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Okay. ” Zhang Huaiming said. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The red-haired girl led Zhang Huaiming to the center of the big screen. It was only nine o&#39;clock and there were not too many people. The red-haired girl went out to call the waiter who paid the bill and left him there alone. After Zhang Huaiming sat down, he looked around. Young men and women sat around in the booths and exchanged cups. Occasionally, he could see a man Zhang Huaiming could call uncle with a big belly surrounded by a group of young and beautiful girls. Those girls were all very good-looking. Later, the red-haired girl held Zhang Huaiming&#39;s ears with her hands and said loudly: &quot;They all have technical faces.&quot; &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;I have seen corgis with pointed faces and small faces. Your description is very appropriate. &quot;Zhang Huaiming leaned into the girl&#39;s ear and said. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;What? ’ she said. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;I say, your description is very appropriate. &quot;Zhang Huaiming turned up the volume in an attempt to cover up the noisy music. The red-haired girl nodded and gave Zhang Huaiming a thumbs up. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;When swiping the card, Zhang Huaiming was surprised to find that he didn&#39;t feel any distress at all. This feeling was very dreamy. Yesterday afternoon, he was still debating whether to eat the 15 yuan duck leg set or the 10 yuan braised lion head set. He chose the latter. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Maybe this is progress, he thought. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;When the waiter held up the spade sign and lined up in a long line to deliver wine to Zhang Huaiming&#39;s table, he actually had a feeling that he could control the situation. He remembered Jack on the bow of the Titanic. The sentence shouted by the deck mast: &quot;I&#39;m&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;king&amp;nbsp;of&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;world.&quot; Zhang Huaiming knew the meaning. He also wanted to shout but his words were not smooth. At this moment, the dark clouds above his head could not be stopped. His pride was gone, and he wanted to dance and have a carnival. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The red-haired girl invited several friends to the booth to drink together. Zhang Huaiming felt like a monarch with millions of beauties. It&#39;s nice to have money, he thought. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;With the strength of the wine, he hugged the red-haired girl and said: &quot;I will give you a gift of two hundred thousand yuan, will you marry me?&quot; &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;It’s hard to get married,&amp;rdquo;she said, &amp;ldquo;I want to marry the person I love. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Someone seemed to have said before that she wanted to marry the person she loved. Because of this sentence, Zhang Huaiming came to Hangzhou alone, and he drank eight thousand eighty-eight ounces of champagne, which was like horse urine. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Damn it. &amp;rdquo; he shouted. The rain above his head finally fell from Zhang Huaiming&#39;s eyes. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;5.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;At three o&#39;clock in the morning, Zhang Huaiming staggered home alone. He drank Drunk, I thought sleep would be merciful, but my brain didn&#39;t allow it, and I repeatedly asked Zhang Huaiming: &quot;Who are you?&quot; &amp;rdquo;&amp;ldquo;Where do you come from? &amp;rdquo;&amp;ldquo;Where to go? &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;He thought of the day he got the college admission notice, feeling very high-spirited. As the only college student in the village, he felt that his future had unlimited possibilities. He even fantasized about leading his small mountain village out of poverty and becoming rich. A kind of narcissistic heroic spirit stirred in the chest of the 18-year-old Zhang Huaiming. But at the age of 26, he was drunk and obsessed with the love between his children. Even the end of the world didn&#39;t matter at this moment. He just wanted to dial her number. The first call was hung up after three rings, and the second and third calls were hung up. One didn&#39;t even have time to ring the bell. It&#39;s all over now, Zhang Huaiming thought. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Zhang Huaiming stared at the slightly mottled ceiling above his head. If it weren&#39;t for the two hundred thousand yuan gift hanging above his head, maybe he would be sitting in the office with peace of mind and receiving a stable salary of three thousand five hundred yuan. You have been promoted and received a salary increase by now, right? Zhang Huaiming thought. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;He counted his life in detail. When he graduated from college with great ambition, Zhang Huaiming thought that he would also have a bright future as mentioned in the Xinhua Dictionary. He felt that this would be the starting point of his life, but he did not Realize that you are actually standing on the top of a mountain. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;All kinds of thoughts kept popping up in Zhang Huaiming&#39;s head. He didn&#39;t want to know who he was, and he didn&#39;t care where he was. He just wanted to know where he should go? Let’s submit our resume tomorrow, he thought. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Just when Zhang Huaiming almost caught Sleepy&#39;s tail, another sound of &quot;babble, babble, babble&quot; came from upstairs. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The sound of rushing water sounded again, and Zhang Huaiming knew that the male owner of the house had completed the final sprint. He habitually opened WeChat, exited, and changed the wallpaper from her photo to the red &quot;alive&quot; in fine brushwork. Did this guy take drugs tonight? Zhang Huaiming thought. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;In a daze, Zhang Huaiming made up his mind to do something tomorrow. He decided to be a warrior and fight for his right to sleep in this strange city. He would integrate here and no longer be alone. of travelers. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;At ten o&#39;clock in the morning, Zhang Huaiming mustered up the courage to go to the door of the couple&#39;s house upstairs. He took a deep breath, made a smile, and knocked on the door, all in one go, as if he had rehearsed it in advance. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The door opened, but before the word trouble was uttered, Zhang Huaiming’s smile froze. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The person who opened the door was a woman he was very familiar with. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;It’s your mother’s fault. &amp;rdquo;He said. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;With a heart-rending roar, everyone’s eyes moved to the sixth floor. It turns out that the end of life is also accompanied by the sound of &quot;babbling&quot;, Zhang Huaiming thought as he took that crucial step from the window sill. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;6.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Is this the reason why you jumped from the building? &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Yes. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;If it weren’t for the fire drill at short notice, Mr. Yan would be the one sitting in front of you asking this question. The policeman opposite tapped the table with his hand: &quot;What are your plans next?&quot; &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Be a good person. ” Zhang Huaiming said. &lt;/p>;&lt;/p>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;Editor in charge: Nana&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For information about the call for submissions, please see the @ONE Studio pinned on Weibo. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Author&lt;/p>; &lt;hr style=&quot;margin-top: 15px;&quot;/>; &lt;table>; &lt;tr>; &lt;td style=&quot;width: 50px;&quot;>; &lt;img src=&quot;http: //image.wufazhuce.com/FvPqZorGdm-DV-9fmk9EbYcKbwV&quot; alt=&quot;Li Zao&quot;>; &lt;/td>; &lt;td>; &lt;div>;Li Zao&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10px&quot;>;&amp;nbsp;@小张Escape Plan&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div style=&quot;&quot;>;From Hubei, born in 1997. &lt;/div>; &lt;/td>; &lt;td width=&quot;60px&quot;>; &lt;!-- &lt;span onclick=&quot;OneAPP.openDetail(2, )&quot;>;Follow&lt;/span>; -->; &lt;/td>; &lt;/tr>; &lt;/table>; &lt;p>;Related recommendations&lt;/p>; &lt;hr/>; &lt;table>; &lt;tr>; &lt;td style=&quot;width: 40px;&quot;>; &lt;span>;Reading&lt;/span>; &lt;/td>; &lt;td>; &lt; a href=&quot;/article/6165&quot; data-ajax=&quot;false&quot;>; &lt;div>;A long look back&lt;/div>; &lt;div>;Text/Wool Fox&lt;/div>; &lt;/a>; &lt;/td>; &lt;/tr>; &lt;tr>; &lt;td style=&quot;width: 40px;&quot;>; &lt;span>;Read&lt;/span>; &lt;/td>; &lt;td>; &lt;a href=&quot;/article/6162&quot; data-ajax=&quot;false&quot;>; &lt;div>; Lucid Dream&lt;/div>; &lt;div>;Text/Li Tang&lt;/div>; &lt;/a>; &lt;/td>; &lt;/tr>; &lt;/table>; &lt;table>; &lt;tr>; &lt;td>; &lt;div style=&quot;text-align :center;padding:5px;&quot; onclick=&quot;OneAPP.openDetail(2,6170)&quot;>;Click to download ONE app&lt;/div>;&lt;/td>; &lt;/tr>; &lt;/table>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div >; &lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 19 Nov 2023 06:25:04 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[VOL.4061]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://m.wufazhuce.com/one/4197]]><description>&lt;div>;19 Nov. 2023&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;main&quot;>; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;http://image.wufazhuce.com/FhCkZn6F5dvB9IDtJ7MH8bLGdjRc&quot; alt=&quot;Homepage Picture&quot; />; &lt;p >;&lt;span>;VOL.4061&lt;/span>;Photography | Javardh&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;19&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Nov. 2023&lt;/p>; &lt;div>;&lt;/div>; &lt;p>;We all need this For a few hours, I don’t remember my harsh mother’s nagging, I don’t remember the reality of poverty, I don’t remember the existence of imperfection. &lt;/p>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot; color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>; https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 19 Nov 2023 06:25:03 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
