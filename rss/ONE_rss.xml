It is often heard in daily life and cannot be ignored. The question The difficulty is no less than asking a fisherman to explain &quot;what are the good fish to catch?&quot; The kind of logical and rigorous answer that lists the reasons one by one is often unconvincing. Fishing, braving the cold and scorching heat, staying by the water all day and catching nothing, what is there to indulge in! Bird watching is similar. You get up early and go to a wetland or mountain forest that you are already familiar with. Your scalp is dizzy from the sun, you are thirsty and tired, but you only see 20 common bird species, and not a new one was added for three consecutive days. What’s the point! &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;What’s good about catching fish and what’s so good about birds? Anglers and birders, please ask yourself. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;My answer is, &quot;Heartbeat&quot;. After the age of twenty-eight, all my little deer bumps were due to bird watching. My heart stopped, my face turned red, and my soul flew into the sky. In order to experience this feeling again , I’m willing to endure long walks, insect bites, and the dreaded early morning wake-up call in the dark. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I am one of the city birders. As the name suggests, the scope of activities is small. Basically, I only observe brush birds in cities and edges. Unlike the old recommendations, I am not like those who travel across the country to follow phenology and share the same frequency with migratory birds. At the same time, they rarely travel thousands of miles to the border for special birds. I’m not very keen on adding new ones, of course if there are any, I’ll add them. I’m also not a big fan of equipment. So far, I only have a Kowa telescope. Unless I go to a new place, I rarely bring a camera with me. I have only scratched the surface of my knowledge about birds. After two and a half years of bird watching, I have only seen about 280 species of birds. This number will make many novices laugh out loud. As far as I know, a child in Beijing has only been bird watching for three months. , the number surpassed mine. Within two years, he became a boss, and I was still a weakling. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Birders are very involved. If you meet someone who has been in the industry for three years, the number of birds he has watched is 800 or more. This number does not sound like a lot, but you must know that there are only 1,000 bird species in the country. There are more than 400 species, distributed all over the world. To see so many bird species requires huge time and economic costs. I casually joined a WeChat bird watching group, and the photos taken by everyone seemed to be National Geographic photographers. Don’t ask, I’m just a fan. Once everyone starts discussing what high-gloss bird species or fighting pictures have been observed, in the atmosphere of fun and hidden cleverness, I will temporarily collapse the group out of jealousy and release it the next day. If you don’t make progress in other things, you will naturally not be diligent in your hobbies. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;In Shanghai, I go to Houtan Park and Century Park most often, and occasionally to Nanhui. In Houtan Wetland, the long and narrow route can be completed without thinking, while in Century Park, which has more complex terrain, you need to explore slowly, and then exchange bird news with people holding telescopes, and gradually form your own &quot;bird path&quot; ;, you generally know which bird species are distributed in which areas. During the bird migration season, if you are lucky, you can see 60 or 70 species, but only 60 or 70 species. Before birdwatching, there was no way to know the richness of the world around us. These sixty or seventy species of birds had their own names, but in the past they were abstracted as &quot;birds&quot;. I couldn&#39;t name them, and I didn&#39;t even feel that there was any connection between them. What a difference. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;In the past few days, I saw someone posting a broadcast on Douban, saying that they had picked up an injured woodpecker and asking netizens how to save it. Someone immediately responded that this was a night heron, not a woodpecker. I read the original post and couldn&#39;t help but laugh. Why didn&#39;t even the night heron know about it? This is the most common bird. Then I thought about it, before I started bird watching, I didn’t know night herons. I walked through Caohejing every day and saw the big birds standing on the willow branches by the river. They looked dull and familiar. When people approached, they started to quack. He flew away quite resentfully. As for the woodpecker, all I remember is its annoying cartoon image. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;There are two worlds before and after bird watching. At least there will no longer be confusion between woodpeckers and night herons. The trouble of &quot;namelessness&quot; is lessened, and the chaos that permeates my eyes becomes thinner again. Once everything has a name, it becomes more important than me. Pearl-necked turtle doves should not be confused with pigeons. The difference between starlings and blackbirds is greater than men and women. What flies away is not only time but also dark green embroidered eyes. What you catch a glimpse of is not necessarily a beauty, but it may also be a black-naped oriole. Although I can already name five hundred species of birds, the world of birds is still unknown to me, but I am familiar with one-third of an acre of Caohejing. In the evening, birds return to their nests, making noisy noises in the sunset. You remember the names of each of them and know a little bit about their habits. That kind of inexplicable kindness is very suitable for touching yourself. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I have another way to divide human beings. There is naturally no distinction between birdwatchers and non-birdwatchers. They are just two distinct groups of people, with no middle ground. People who don&#39;t watch birds move to people who watch birds, but people who watch birds can never go back to the state of not watching birds. When asked, why does a birder become a birder? The reason is usually as big as the eye of a needle - someone took me to watch it once or twice, or my ex-boyfriend liked to watch it, or my ex-girlfriend liked to watch it, or my favorite author liked to watch it. , in short, once you have observed it once, you cannot stop observing it. That invisible door, you can&#39;t turn back after passing through it, it&#39;s magic. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I often take my friends to bird watching, and most of them just want to participate in a group activity to kill the weekend, or are simply curious about &quot;what&#39;s so interesting about birds.&quot; I always have a responsibility to lead them to explore the richness of the surrounding world - to realize that birds live very lively around them, courting and mating, fighting for territory, insulting each other, flying, or singing for no one, then This kind of self-centered anthropocentrism will immediately be extinguished in the bottom of my heart. &quot;What&#39;s so good about birds?&quot; The answer is self-evident. After watching birds for the first time, they usually only remember about ten species of birds, which is enough to deal with the common birds in urban Shanghai. In the future, I will continue to receive their observation records of Pearl-necked Dove, White-headed Bulbul and Brown-backed Shrike. In the future, one tenth of them will become birders. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>; Regarding how to become a birder, I usually recommend to them a short documentary &quot;The Central Park Effect&quot; (it used to be &quot;Birding Years&quot;, but the excessive sense of competition in it made me feel uncomfortable) : The man-made Central Park has become a resting place for migratory birds in the middle of a concrete desert, attracting birdwatchers to visit tirelessly all year round. Birdwatchers express their love and obsession with birds. During migration, birds can only gather in city parks because their habitats are occupied by cities. Unfortunately, the birds have no choice but to make it easier for bird watchers, allowing us to see them just by walking into the park. So many kinds of birds. This is true of Central Park in New York and Century Park in Shanghai. &quot;Time has different meanings for birders.&quot; I remember one of the birdwatchers suffering from cancer said this. Every migratory bird that visits will be linked to &quot;we first met you, just like an old friend returning home.&quot; It’s a wonderful feeling and I look forward to seeing you again next year. Waiting and chasing are all birder&#39;s homework. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I have written about the common kingfisher before. I have a wonderful feeling for the kingfisher. The long-awaited reunion with the kingfisher in Shenzhen reminded me of the beautiful pastoral scenery I had seen when I was a child. I listed it as for your favorite bird. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;In the southwest border, I once met an old man in his eighties. We were waiting under a huge kapok tree for the Great Gray Woodpecker, which is the largest in China. The woodpecker didn&#39;t come when it got dark, and I felt lost. He patted his thigh and talked about the birds that once made his heart flutter. &quot;The first time I saw the Blue-throated Woodpecker, I went crazy. How could there be such a beautiful bird in the world!&quot; ”, and then he said, “In the Northeast, I almost went crazy when I saw a whooper swan for the first time. &quot;The old man started bird watching after he retired. He has been bird watching for fifteen years and has seen 800 species. Only when he is watching birds does he not feel aging and illness.&quot; When we parted, he said he envied me for being so young, but he couldn&#39;t wait for the time. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Like the old man, the moments when my heart stopped with excitement reoccurred repeatedly. Afterwards, I once shouted &quot;I&#39;m crazy&quot;--the Brown-bellied Blue Fairy Flycatcher that broke in, itself The black-necked crane taking off in the reeds, the three-jeweled bird flying overhead, and the forest eagles circling in the misty air flow - there are too many of them, some of them are not rare, but they are all too beautiful. Why do many birdwatching enthusiasts end up becoming partners? In addition to having similar interests, every time they see a beautiful bird, it triggers a dramatic suspension bridge effect. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I realized that what really makes people addicted is not exactly the false connection between man and nature, which can also be produced by aimlessly walking in the mountains, but the adrenaline induced by bird watching. The soaring quality only comes from the beauty and mystery of the birds themselves - they can fly, have such rich postures and feather colors, and have evolved so delicately and concisely that people have no choice but to bow their heads to nature. Simply bowing your head can bring about purification. miraculous effect. This is also the reason why birders are most likely to become environmentalists. We would never want such a miracle to disappear. I would like to experience the first encounter and reunion with birds thousands of times until the end of my life. &lt;/p>;&lt;/p>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;Editor in charge: Mei Butan onewenzhang@wufazhuce.com&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Welcome to follow the author&#39;s public account &quot;东东来来&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Respondent&lt;/p>; &lt;hr/>; &lt;table>; &lt;tr>; &lt;td style=&quot;width: 50px;&quot;>; &lt;img src=&quot;http://image.wufazhuce.com/FsxJJ6o7YvR5CdQVM2FJrwE3Rq6F &quot; alt=&quot;东来&quot;>; &lt;/td>; &lt;td>; &lt;div>;东来&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10px&quot;>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div style=&quot;&quot;>;No. The first prize winner in the literary category of the 6th Douban Reading Essay Competition. &lt;/div>; &lt;/td>; &lt;td width=&quot;60px&quot;>; &lt;!-- &lt;span onclick=&quot;OneAPP.openDetail(4, )&quot;>;Follow&lt;/span>; -->; &lt;/td>; &lt;/tr>; &lt;/table>; &lt;p>;Related recommendations&lt;/p>; &lt;hr/>; &lt;table>; &lt;tr>; &lt;td style=&quot;width: 40px;&quot;>; &lt;span>;Question and Answer&lt;/span>; &lt;/td>; &lt;td>; &lt; a href=&quot;/question/3835&quot; data-ajax=&quot;false&quot;>; &lt;div>;What is the fun of fishing? &lt;/div>; &lt;div style=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/div>; &lt;/a>; &lt;/td>; &lt;/tr>; &lt;/table>; &lt;table>; &lt;tr>; &lt;td>;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align:center ;padding:5px;&quot; onclick=&quot;OneAPP.openDetail(4,3963)&quot;>;Click to download ONE app&lt;/div>;&lt;/td>; &lt;/tr>; &lt;/table>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 01 Nov 2023 06:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[等待未来]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://m.wufazhuce.com/article/6148]]><description>&lt;div>;1 Nov. 2023&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;main&quot;>; &lt;div>; &lt;p>;Text/Su Gengsheng&lt;/p>; &lt;div>; &lt;p>;&lt;div contenteditable=&quot;false&quot;>;&lt;img data-author=&quot;&quot; data-original-src=&quot;http://image.wufazhuce.com/Fo8T4Hn9JlCkWOUie3KrDVgaafGk&quot; data-source=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://image.wufazhuce.com/Fo8T4Hn9JlCkWOUie3KrDVgaafGk&quot;>;&lt;/div >;&lt;div>;&lt;div style=&quot;font-size:26px;line-height: 1;&quot;>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Time is not out of order yet, the city is still running smoothly, life is normal and calm, but in my heart But it seems like there is a black hole. Do you feel the same way? &lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Lately I seem to have been waiting, waiting for something to happen. The sky in front of us was foggy, and the city seemed to be shrouded in dust and smoke. Although the weather was not as expected, I still went to many places. Autumn is lurking in every corner of the city, but what I was waiting for has still not happened. Sometimes when I wake up in the morning, I feel empty. After a long time, I forget what I was waiting for. Time passed and I was still at a loss. It got dark prematurely, so I turned on the lights in advance, put on thicker clothes, and tried my best to keep myself warm and comfortable. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Let’s talk about time. Sometimes I think that all stories in the world have only one protagonist, and that is time. It dominates everything, and people act under the control of time. It is time for us to forget our expectations, heal our wounds, and let go of our hatred. Nowadays, I have long forgotten what kind of person I used to be. Days pass day by day, one day at a time. Looking forward at this time, I can’t see clearly, and looking back, I feel even more confused. I seem to be stuck in a gap in time. I can&#39;t say I&#39;m disappointed or happy, I&#39;m just living like this. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;One day I thought, isn’t this the peace I have been looking forward to for half my life? Get up quietly every day, read, eat, take a shower, go to bed, and sleep at night. In the past, I longed for this kind of peace. As long as nothing happened every day, I would earn it. But in days like this, I am not used to it. No, I am not stupid enough to be upset because of the calmness. On the contrary, I am very grateful. But I still wonder, what is after the calmness? I used to be discouraged while running around and just wanted to live a simple and peaceful life. Now I finally have it, what next? It was also at a certain time that I suddenly figured out what I was afraid of, which was &quot;no more&quot;. The days to come will be like this moment. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;One evening, there was heavy smog in the city and the roads were congested. I drove back to the city from the mountains, and the visibility was no more than ten meters along the way. After entering the city, the neon lights were dimmed in the thick fog, and everything was blurry and unclear. I drove onto the overpass, and suddenly a subway passed by above my head, and the originally bright windows became misty. I felt like I was in the future, everything was gray, the huge overpass was busy with traffic, and the subway passed by slowly, silently. , this city is as silent as me. At that moment I thought, that&#39;s what I feared: &quot;there will be no after&quot;. I worry that I will always be like driving a car on the road but unable to find the destination. The city moves forever but has no direction. We all just run peacefully day after day. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Occasionally I ask myself, isn’t this a good thing? Don’t you desperately long for this kind of calm when you’re living in the eye of a storm? For those who remain in the storm, this calm is rare. Yes, peace is nice, but it’s not enough. As humans (although this is a bit funny to say), it is our nature to ask, &quot;What next?&quot; Standing at the crossroads of time, we have the responsibility and obligation to ask &quot;What next?&quot; Although time is the protagonist of everything, we are human beings. We have brains, wisdom, and courage (if we have it), and we should create the future. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;After saying so much, I looked around. If someone could tell me what direction the future would take, I would definitely walk there without stopping, but There was no sound at this moment. I think confusion and unknown are both part of the future, and the confusion at this moment is also part of the future. The future makes people look forward to it so much and yet makes them so confused, otherwise it would not be the future. So I felt a little more happy. The temporary confusion should not bother me, but made me look forward to it even more. Although I still don’t know what I’m looking forward to, I have to look forward to it happily. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Autumn is too short and I haven’t had time to take a good look. I decided to spend a few more days getting to know autumn, watching the yellow leaves falling on the branches, watching the bus sighing as it pulled into the station at midnight, watching people happily going for autumn outings, and watching all the world that only exists in autumn. The four seasons do not swear to the mountains and forests, and the prosperity and decline are as they happen. We wait, we sigh, we still have expectations in the changing seasons, and we are still waiting for the future. So I braced myself, opened my eyes, and waited for the future to come. &lt;/p>;&lt;/p>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;Editor in charge: Nana&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Su Gengsheng’s column &quot;At This Moment&quot; is updated exclusively on the &quot;ONE&quot; APP every two weeks on Wednesdays. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Author&lt;/p>; &lt;hr style=&quot;margin-top: 15px;&quot;/>; &lt;table>; &lt;tr>; &lt;td style=&quot;width: 50px;&quot;>; &lt;img src=&quot;http: //image.wufazhuce.com/Fg_e6teZsb3lZ1QStYtdnAkh6bO8&quot; alt=&quot;Su Gengsheng&quot;>; &lt;/td>; &lt;td>; &lt;div>;Su Gengsheng&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10px&quot;>;&amp;nbsp;@ False Su Gengsheng&lt;/span >; &lt;/div>; &lt;div style=&quot;&quot;>;&quot;ONE·One&quot; resident writer. &lt;/div>; &lt;/td>; &lt;td width=&quot;60px&quot;>; &lt;!-- &lt;span onclick=&quot;OneAPP.openDetail(2, )&quot;>;Follow&lt;/span>; -->; &lt;/td>; &lt;/tr>; &lt;/table>; &lt;p>;Related recommendations&lt;/p>; &lt;hr/>; &lt;table>; &lt;tr>; &lt;td style=&quot;width: 40px;&quot;>; &lt;span>;Reading&lt;/span>; &lt;/td>; &lt;td>; &lt; a href=&quot;/article/6132&quot; data-ajax=&quot;false&quot;>; &lt;div>;The comfort of autumn&lt;/div>; &lt;div>;Text/Su Gengsheng&lt;/div>; &lt;/a>; &lt;/td>; &lt;/tr>; &lt;tr>; &lt;td style=&quot;width: 40px;&quot;>; &lt;span>;Read&lt;/span>; &lt;/td>; &lt;td>; &lt;a href=&quot;/article/6112&quot; data-ajax=&quot;false&quot;>; &lt;div>; Tomorrow will be better&lt;/div>; &lt;div>;Text/Su Gengsheng&lt;/div>; &lt;/a>; &lt;/td>; &lt;/tr>; &lt;tr>; &lt;td style=&quot;width: 40px;&quot;>; &lt;span>;Read&lt; /span>; &lt;/td>; &lt;td>; &lt;a href=&quot;/article/6088&quot; data-ajax=&quot;false&quot;>; &lt;div>;Autumn&#39;s pause button&lt;/div>; &lt;div>;Text/Su Gengsheng&lt;/div >; &lt;/a>; &lt;/td>; &lt;/tr>; &lt;/table>; &lt;table>; &lt;tr>; &lt;td>; &lt;div style=&quot;text-align:center;padding:5px;&quot; onclick=&quot;OneAPP.openDetail(2 ,6148)&quot;>;Click to download ONE app&lt;/div>;&lt;/td>; &lt;/tr>; &lt;/table>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;br>;&lt;hr>; &lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br >;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 01 Nov 2023 06:25:02 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[VOL.4043]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://m.wufazhuce.com/one/4183]]><description>&lt;div>;1 Nov. 2023&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;main&quot;>; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;http://image.wufazhuce.com/FhK_nMaMpUoIbiPqEBhV5ADucnXc&quot; alt=&quot;Homepage Picture&quot; />; &lt;p >;&lt;span>;VOL.4043&lt;/span>;Photography | Kevin Laminto&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;1&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Nov. 2023&lt;/p>; &lt;div>;&lt;/div>; &lt;p>;The sun is good Sometimes, you will feel that you can live for a long time, and you can even live with joy. &lt;/p>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 01 Nov 2023 06:25:02 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
