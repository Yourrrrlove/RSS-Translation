is a warm greeting, but , people who hear this greeting don’t want to go home, and people who long for this greeting have difficulty having a home. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Welcome home! &amp;rdquo;My father said to Lu Yao. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The midsummer in this small town is very long. The bright sunshine and abundant rain together give birth to the famous lychee. As a result, this industrial city is both an oil city and a Licheng city. This small place, which was originally impoverished from the inside out, has been given this title to add a touch of arty humanism. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Lychee is still the most delicious with cinnamon flavor! &quot;Lu Yao&#39;s father picked a bunch of thin fruits from the lychee tree in front of the big house. They were at a height within reach, and they were dazzlingly red. They were born to tempt themselves to pick them.&quot; &quot;The fruit of this variety is not big, but the core is as fine as a pearl, and there is even the aroma of osmanthus in the mouth!&quot; &amp;rdquo;My father is nearly seventy years old, but his voice is loud and full of energy. His hair should have been covered with snow, but time and time again, he took the trouble to dye his hair jet black with his own hands. His hands were not very skillful, and they shook violently, staining some black strands and some white strands, reflecting the dissatisfaction in his father&#39;s soul. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;It takes four hours to fly home from Beidiao’s daughter, and we don’t see her only a few times a year. Lu Yao&#39;s return to his hometown coincided with the lychee season, and several lychee trees in the countryside were bearing fruit again. He happily let his daughter taste the fruits he had nourished with his own hands, telling the characteristics of various lychees like every local old man. She was distracted in the heat wave, and suddenly thought that if she used the language system of &quot;big city&quot; to package this local product, there would definitely be a sentence - the top note of laurel. Such a conflict brought a smile to her eyes. Her father gained recognition from this smile and spoke even more happily. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;In addition to Lu Yao, there was also a strange woman in the audience. Everyone called her Alan. Aunt Lan looks to be about forty years old. She is wearing a pink and purple dress. She has a plump figure, no more jewelry, no more jewelry, no more expressions, no more words, and only occasionally echoes her father. Externally, my father calls Aunt Lan his live-in nanny and driver, just like many widowers who give some &quot;job opportunities&quot; to their newly found young partners. She is not with her father all year round, and the person who accompanies her father day and night is Aunt Lan. At this moment, Aunt Lan smiled perfunctorily, and although her eyes were focused on her father&#39;s face, her eyes were distracted. She suddenly understood that compared to Aunt Lan, she was the one who was no more, no less, and dispensable. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;My mother passed away suddenly five years ago. Her parents were a perfect match in an unworldly sense - they tortured each other during their thirty-seven years of marriage, and countless earth-shattering arguments spread throughout this small place. Lu Yao witnessed the dishes in the dining room being broken. The porcelain pieces that her mother broke with her own hands cut her own calf with a sharp blade. Dark red blood slowly oozed out from the wound and slid down, but she still argued loudly with her father with a blushing face. Like feeling no pain. At that time, Lu Yao was still young enough to be frightened to the point of crying by such a scene. She wanted to hide in her brother&#39;s arms, but he was obviously numb to such a scene and closed the door quietly. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Compared to husband and wife or parents, their more suitable relationship and role should be &quot;business partners&quot;. The two started their business from scratch, but they still couldn&#39;t understand each other, let alone talk about a long-lasting love. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Excellent business partners always calculate their accounts well, including their emotional accounts, and they always make sure that they make a profit without losing money. Lu Yao had heard his father cry again and again. But the one she remembers most vividly was when her mother was the living protagonist. Not long after grandma passed away at that time, my father would always cry loudly, as if he was crying a lot. The crying burned out my mother&#39;s patience, and she yelled angrily, &quot;Stop crying!&quot; But Lu Yao couldn&#39;t remember whether his father&#39;s crying stopped because of this. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;A few years before her mother passed away, the conflict between the couple, who was nearly 60 years old, intensified to the point where one party signed a divorce agreement. My father openly said to my mother who was sweating profusely in the kitchen: &quot;You are not suitable for me, and I am not suitable for you.&quot; &quot;When Lu Yao heard it, he just thought it was ridiculous. It took more than thirty years to realize that it was not suitable. The cost of such trial and error was too high. Later, the parents&#39; quarrel was settled, but they unanimously pointed the finger at Lu Yao. She heard her parents talking loudly outside the room. Why was Lu Yao still at home? Really annoying. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;So she stopped going home until her mother died suddenly in early summer a few years later. She stayed with her father, who lived alone, for three months. His crying suddenly broke out and then stopped suddenly, day and night, like one unforeseen thunderstorm after another in the south. The power of the changing seasons is enough to take away sadness. In the first winter after his mother passed away, his father was able to take Lu Yao to meet a divorced violin professor with a smile on his face. They had dinner in a private room of the restaurant. The eloquent father smiled for Professor Bo and said that he had a mole on the sole of his foot, which represented intelligence. To prove this, he took off his shoes and socks, raised his feet and showed the soles of his feet. The violin professor smiled wildly, but whether this was true love or social etiquette, no one knew. Her father also laughed, and so did Lu Yao, as if her inherited genes forced her to laugh. At this time, she should laugh. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Before meeting Aunt Lan, Lu Yao didn’t know how many women his father had made funny with such jokes, and he didn’t want to know. Relatives were talking a lot. My father spent a lot of money on Aunt Lan. Should the brother and sister take care of it? The Lu family brothers and sisters smiled cowardly and awkwardly, and the only thing they could do was to escape. No one wants to go back to that city. The asphalt of every road is mixed with right and wrong, and you can hear rumors with every step you take. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Lu Yao received a message from Party A at dusk and confirmed with her the time and place of the meeting the day after tomorrow. She suddenly realized that this was the last time she saw the sunset in her hometown during this holiday. The dazzling and proud golden color melted into an apricot red and stained the sky. It seemed gentle, but in fact it could still burn the eyes. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The three of them had a simple dinner at a nearby farm restaurant, returned to the big house, and played a few rounds of mahjong with their cousin who lived nearby. The sound of the mahjong machine was like a leisurely pastoral life. The brilliance, if it has magic power, will speed up time. When the card game ended, the moon was already high, and the low stars hung in the sky, shining weakly, unable to illuminate the country roads. My father suddenly remembered that the lychee tree in the backyard also bore fruit, and it was the white sugar poppy that Aunt Lan liked. He held a flashlight and shouted to his cousin: &quot;Help me bring the ladder over here!&quot; I want to pick lychees! &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;My cousin opened his eyes in disbelief: &quot;It&#39;s so black now, how can you see it and pick it?&quot; And the bunch was knotted so high that there was no suitable ladder. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Didn’t I ask you to prepare a ladder a long time ago! &amp;rdquo;There was sullenness in his father&#39;s tone. &quot;I don&#39;t care!&quot; Go next door and borrow a ladder! &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;My cousin hesitated in place with an embarrassed expression. Aunt Lan tried to smooth things over and said, &quot;It&#39;s okay to pick it again tomorrow.&quot; It&#39;s too dark now, so it&#39;s really hard to pick. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;No! &amp;rdquo;The father&#39;s tone was harder than that of Litchi Mu. &amp;ldquo;We will pick it tonight! If you don’t borrow a ladder, I’ll climb up and pick it even if I bring a stool! &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The three of them began to chatter endlessly. Time in the countryside is worthless, and there is no need to delve into the meaning of repeated tug-of-war. The sharp dialect was turned into a trickle by the thin moonlight, and flowed through Lu Yao&#39;s ears on the summer night wind. She felt lucky that she was dispensable, which meant that she could continue to escape. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Until the cousin&#39;s patience was worn out, he said forcefully: &quot;The old man next door climbed a tree to pick lychees during the day yesterday. The lychee tree broke and he fell from the tree. Fortunately, he fell on the tree. On the chicken coop! Let me ask you, if you fall, how many years can Alan take care of you? &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Lu Yao was aroused by the slightly funny word &quot;chicken coop&quot;, so she was able to hear this question like a cold front cutting open everyone&#39;s heart. Everything was peaceful. Even in the prosperous age, I have no shame to face this question mark. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;My father finally gave up the idea of ​​picking lychees. In the dark night, Lu Yao still saw the look in his father&#39;s eyes that was eager to try and yet calm, which was exactly the same as his unevenly colored hair. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Aunt Lan comforted him with confidence: &quot;I know you can definitely pick it!&quot; We&#39;ll go buy a ladder tomorrow during the day! &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Lu Yao remained silent, like a mute from a foreign country. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The next day Lu Yao boarded the plane with a box of lychees. The closer she got to her destination, the blurrier her original name became, as if she had forgotten to combine the two A simple word to take on the plane. When she entered the industry, her name was Bonnie. When meeting clients for the first time, she always likes to show innocent and harmless eyes, using her affinity to lower the other party&#39;s wariness, and gain more trust and negotiation space for herself. But there are all kinds of people in the world. She once met a young man who slammed the table at her and asked loudly in the conference software on the other side of the computer: &quot;I am Party A!&quot; Why can&#39;t you meet my requirements when I paid for it? &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Bonnie has been in a company with &quot;strong Party B&quot; since she entered the industry. If Party A wants to reach cooperation, in most cases it cannot force negotiations into this atmosphere. Bonnie was so angry that she clenched her fists when she encountered this situation for the first time. She faced the screen, raised her volume, and counterattacked with a slightly trembling voice: &quot;First of all, at the beginning of the cooperation, I already informed this request via email that we would not be able to cooperate.&quot; . Moreover, the case has been discussed for two months, and we have tried our best to meet all your needs during the process. In addition, we are equals. It is recommended that we wait until you calm down before communicating. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The two sides cut off the meeting almost simultaneously. She was at a loss when her relationship with Party A was frozen for the first time. She doesn&#39;t yet understand that thick skin is the most important thing in traveling in the world, and the student spirit has not completely faded away, hypnotizing her to do things neatly. Remedy, must remedy. She thought of Chris, another contact person from Party A, who was experienced and steady. But he was only responsible for setting up the connection in this case, and the other party also told her in a subtle way that the follow-up of the matter had nothing to do with him. It was already 9 o&#39;clock in the evening, and she was the only one left in the huge office. Feeling helpless and fearful, she almost drowned. Her survival instinct still pushed her to send a message to Chris, asking if it was convenient to call him. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Although she has just entered the workplace, it can be speculated that the most self-interested thing for Chris&#39; character to do when encountering this kind of thing is to avoid it. What&#39;s more, it&#39;s already off work time... Bonnie speculated in confusion for half a minute, and Chris dialed in. She answered the phone like a piece of driftwood. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;That was two years ago. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Recently, Chris and Bonnie had a phone call about a new case. After the business talk, they chatted and inevitably brought up the ridiculous incident. Chris no longer remembers what he said during that awkward phone call. Bonnie smiled and replied, &quot;You don&#39;t have to remember it, I&#39;ll just remember it.&quot; &amp;rdquo;For her, as long as the other party is still willing to talk, it means that her arguments are correct - even if right or wrong in the world is not important, it all depends on the outcome, but at that time she was still stubbornly guarding Follow your own inner sense of right and wrong. &amp;ldquo;At the same time. &amp;rdquo;Bonnie continued, &amp;ldquo;I know it&#39;s reasonable, you don&#39;t need to make that phone call with me, so I&#39;m very grateful to you. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;She heard Chris sighing with a smile. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;What’s wrong? &amp;rdquo; she asked. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Who makes you so cute? ” Chris’ tone was calm, just like when talking about official matters. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Bonnie smiled, out of embarrassment, vanity, and a genetic force that forced her to laugh. At this time, she should laugh. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Chris was on a business trip for this new case. He visited Bonnie&#39;s company at the agreed time the day before and walked into the conference room. The transparent glass door isolated the sound from inside and outside. Colleagues outside the conference room watched Bonnie keep laughing, pressing her knuckles against her nose, leaning forward and back, even her hair was straining. Chris was motionless, with both coldness and heat in his eyes. The light covered his glasses with a thin mist, making it even more elusive to understand his thoughts. The conference room was like a big fish tank, and Bonnie&#39;s exaggerated body movements were like a little goldfish struggling desperately to adapt to the new water. Chris didn&#39;t seem to be in the water, but more like a passerby passing by the fish tank and stopping to watch. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Two hours is already the limit for just talking about business matters, but the meeting lasted five hours. Chris is a eloquent man who talks about both business and personal interests. His humor is restrained and he confides in temptation. Seemingly unfinished, Chris asked her if she would like to have dinner together. She knew she had no right to refuse. What&#39;s more, it&#39;s really fun to talk to. Bonnie and Chris are from the same hometown, and both grew up under the influence of Hong Kong and Taiwan’s pop culture. Chris always likes to throw out a few lines of Hong Kong Philharmonic lyrics, and Bonnie can always catch them and expand the topic, like playing table tennis back and forth, tirelessly and unable to get tired. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;They clinked glasses with cocktails in the restaurant. As the meal came to an end, Bonnie put her chin on the back of her hand and asked, &quot;Can your family agree to your five-day business trip this time?&quot; After all, your child has just been born, and your wife and children are waiting for you to take care of him. &amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Chris said jokingly: &quot;Being in jail also requires a break.&quot; Besides, I can&#39;t help much at home. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Aren’t you eager to travel? &amp;rdquo;Bonnie asked with a smile. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;I pray every day...&amp;rdquo;He deliberately sang out of tune. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Bonnie did not connect the last line of lyrics. &quot;Getting rid of the loneliness of love&quot; is something she can&#39;t do, so she doesn&#39;t need to mention it. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;They walked out of the business district, and the dazzling lights on the shopping street dimmed one after another. The street lamps were higher than the trees, and the silver light passed through the leaves and fell to the ground, like pieces. The bleak fallen leaves withered prematurely. They walked around the shop along the silver leaves, and Bonnie continued to laugh dutifully at Chris&#39; humor, which was half true and false. She felt tired after laughing for too long, and her voice was gritty. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;They sat side by side on the steps at the door of a shop that had passed its business hours. They each lit a cigarette and exhaled into clouds. The white mist in the evening breeze lingered between them, like a cigarette. Chris&#39;s endless jokes avoid deeper topics. Bonnie realized that the other party was trying to escape. Maybe it was the desire to get off work that gave her courage, or maybe the nicotine was mixed with truth serum. She said, &quot;I always feel that you are afraid of going back to the hotel to rest.&quot; &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Chris pondered for a moment and smiled: &quot;Yes.&quot; Then there will be no excuse not to reply to the mountain of messages. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;It’s not rude not to reply to work messages at this time. There must be an excuse to avoid it, the only one is the family message with dependence and warmth. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;She heard him talk in an understatement about getting married and having children, which was not his intention. In desperation, she did not forget to mix in a few classic lines from old Hong Kong movies. After his mother retired, she left her hometown and went to his city to take care of the baby with his wife. This major event in life is the long-cherished wish of both elders. Even if he has long known that this is not the life he wants, even if the old turkey soup is boiling and the beautiful fairy tale &quot;the steering wheel of life is in his hands the moment he becomes an adult&quot;, But the passenger seat is always noisy, with countless voices clamoring that the driver should turn left, even if the desired destination requires continuing straight; even though so many people compare a person&#39;s smooth sailing to &quot;life is on track,&quot; but that road The railway track is like an unfalsifiable formula. Once you get on the track, you can no longer control yourself. Bonnie recalled that during her graduation season, there was a music marketing campaign that swept the country, and the song was called &quot;Into the Sea.&quot; At that time, the pneumonia had not spread around the world, and the energetic young people were still dreaming of becoming a galloping wave. Bonnie was also moved to tears by such a dream, and traveled around the world with her passion for the industry in her hands. After a long time, I suddenly understood that if you want to become a wave after a drop of water flows into the stream, it will be difficult to have the direction you want to go. &quot;Go with the flow&quot; has been extended from an objective existence to a derogatory term, but you have to admit that it is safe. And right. Observing the earth from a far enough distance, individual human beings are no different in size from water droplets. If we are not determined and strong enough and do not throw ourselves into the rivers, the risk of evaporation is too high. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Since your current life has nothing to do with what you want, you must know what you want, right? &amp;rdquo;Bonnie turned her head and looked directly into Chris&#39; eyes. She has asked this question to many people, but most of them couldn&#39;t give an answer. So even if you are dissatisfied with your current life, the only thing you can do is blame others. Even if the answer is clear enough, people who have already entered the mainstream will find it difficult to have the courage to risk everything and stage a real-life version of &quot;The Moon and Sixpence.&quot; &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Bonnie guessed that Chris would still use some cold jokes to get around the problem, but he didn&#39;t. He met her eyes and said generously: &quot;I want to live alone.&quot; I have always thought this way from before to now. ” Immediately he sang off-key with a smile on his face: “Actually, I’m happier alone.” &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The simpler the wish, the harder it is to reach the sky. He will not fail to understand that even if his mother complains when she takes care of his baby, it is still the happiness she wants. With children and grandchildren around her, the elderly woman feels needed in her efforts. She can still say &quot;Welcome home&quot; to her son after he gets off work. The happiness of that generation can only be hatched under such circumstances. He didn&#39;t say much, but Bonnie could also guess that when she was single, she received an overwhelming amount of urging and persuasion from her elders. This is the norm in the world. If his mother is unhappy, he himself cannot be happy. But it turns out that even if his mother is happy, he is still so far away from happiness. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;But it is better for one person to be unhappy than for the whole family to be unhappy. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The cigarette packs are all empty, and the cigarette butts are probably filled with half a discarded can. Chris stood up slowly and said in a daze: &quot;Why did I tell you so much.&quot; &amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Bonnie looked at the can and thought, how could she be the only one listening to what he said. But he couldn&#39;t help but be greedy. Will he be one of the few people who listen to his true words? &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The answer is not important. Bonnie said softly, the bell ringing the signal to go home. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Farewell. No one had any extra words to say. The follow-up of the business is still inevitable, but it is still going smoothly. The two developed a wonderful tacit understanding, and they only talked about business matters on the phone and messaging software knowingly, as if the familiarity they felt when they met was just a fallacy. It seems that both parties understand that revealing too much of one&#39;s concerns to a work partner is unprofessional. Those who listen, understand and resonate may be rare and expensive, but if the temperature rises too quickly, it will easily burn people. It is like lighting a firework stick illegally in the city on a summer night, and then skimming it off after it has bloomed in the hand. Spark is more worth remembering. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;It would be okay if it was that simple. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Office workers are extremely sensitive to Fridays, and Bonnie counts down the weekend in seconds. But the weather was extremely bad. Heavy rain washed away every corner of the city, but it became dirtier and dirtier with each wash, and the sky became grayer and grayer. The traffic congestion indicators on the map glowed with circles of deep red, like ripples with Tiananmen as the center. She suddenly realized that Chris would also finish his business trip today. In such weather, he might sing a line from Eason Chan&#39;s &quot;The Years Are Like a Canticle&quot; and lament, &quot;The weather is not as expected, but I have to fly if I have to go.&quot; She figured it out like this. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;But she saw Chris sharing another song on social platforms, &quot;Neither Come nor Go&quot;. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;Just pretend that I have never been here or been there. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Bonnie’s finger paused for a moment and then crossed over. She curled up her legs uncomfortably and bumped into the box of lychees specially brought back from the south under her desk. This was supposed to be for Chris. Why did you forget it? She squatted down and opened the box, and a rotten bitterness instantly washed over her face - this was the aftertaste of expired lychee. Unable to bear to look any further, she quickly closed the box and threw it into the trash can on the fire escape. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;She washed her hands and returned to her work station. Several messages popped up in the dinner group chat of her college classmates tonight, suggesting that the dinner should be postponed to eight o&#39;clock. With such weather and road conditions, it was impossible to make it on time. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Can Teacher Lu do it? &amp;rdquo;She seemed to be the only one who didn’t reply. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;A person can have countless roles, and each role has a title. And when did an inexplicable trend start, everyone can be &quot;honored&quot; as &quot;teacher&quot;. She didn&#39;t like it, she just felt weird. So she replied: Okay, and don&#39;t call me that. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The dinner was held at an old Western restaurant. The heavy rain diluted the business, and the door was empty. The wooden sliding door that was soaked by the rain looked even older, and the sound it made was like an old man in his twilight years saying welcome. She was the second to arrive and saw Lan Ming sitting in the corner, flipping through a paper book to the slightly louder jazz music. She walked straight towards him and sat opposite him. Lan Ming then raised his head and happily said &quot;Long time no see&quot;. He handed Lu Yao a tissue in a gentlemanly manner so that she could dry the water droplets on her hair. Lu Yao ordered a cocktail and asked him what book he was reading so fascinatedly. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Books by Yukio Mishima. &amp;rdquo;He showed the book cover. Lu Yao said that he had not seen it and asked him to introduce it to fill the time waiting for others to join the game. He spoke very quickly, and his eyes flickered in a panic. Lu Yao pretended to listen attentively, playing with the hanging red and white checkered tablecloth in his hand. Looking at his stiff behavior, he speculated that the other party&#39;s anxiety disorder was serious and needed some medical intervention. I have the impression that he has a drinking problem and is unlikely to get better - Lan Ming comes from a family of intellectuals. After graduating from college, he went to the United States to study for a PhD. He was under great pressure and there was no possibility of quitting drinking. He graduated successfully this year and passed by Beijing on business before going to work in the south. It was a rare opportunity to catch up with friends, so we decided to have a dinner tonight. Wherever he showed up, there was supposed to be a party, and alcohol was naturally consumed. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;In order to avoid spoilers, Lan Ming did not explain the plot of the book in too much detail, so that the topic was completely dropped, and the others still did not arrive. She took advantage of the situation and asked, &quot;Why don&#39;t you and Susan come together?&quot; When will she arrive? &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The smile on his face continued: &amp;ldquo;We have broken up. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;She was stunned for a second in embarrassment, and then said with an expression of disbelief: &quot;Oh my god, Susan and you went to the United States to study together, and everyone was extremely envious of you... Why? &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;It’s still inappropriate. The trigger was actually that she was moving and I agreed to help. But when the day came for moving, I was busy writing my thesis, and she was left to figure it out on her own. We didn&#39;t quarrel again because of this matter and broke up peacefully. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Lu Yao looked at him speechlessly, like a sculpture. Lan Ming said: &quot;What&#39;s wrong? Do you think I went too far?&quot; &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;No. &amp;rdquo;Lu Yao organized his words slowly. &quot;I just think that you didn&#39;t like her that much at that time.&quot; &amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Lan Ming&#39;s eyes lit up and he said: &quot;Accurate!&quot; He clinked glasses with Lu Yao and continued: &quot;She can accept it calmly, which actually means that she feels the same way.&quot; Everyone felt that they could find someone better or more suitable, so they broke up. Now she also has a boyfriend, and it seems that she has reached the stage of talking about marriage... In fact, the relationship between me and her is quite complicated. She is a native of Beijing, her home is here, and she makes it clear that she will not go to other cities after returning to China. And I didn’t like it here, so I knew very early on that we had no future. It&#39;s good to have an amicable breakup, and you see, I can still invite her to a party tonight. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Lu Yao agreed with him, &quot;suitable&quot;, an intriguing standard, and a pass to the marriage palace. If it is not suitable, the heartbeats of both parties seem to be of little value, let alone feelings such as &quot;unrequited love&quot;, &quot;secret love&quot;, and &quot;unable to love&quot;. It seems that she has not listened to anyone in recent years. I mentioned that I was trapped in such a small love affair. Just because everyone is pushed by time and has reached the semi-mature stage of thirty years old, the sand dunes piled up by the big and small things in life have become so high that they scare themselves. When competing in the industry, you should not only focus on the immediate salary, but also focus on the future, clearly see the development possibilities, do your best for promotion opportunities, and adjust your actions and attitudes towards the standards set by others. When it comes to your health, you can&#39;t just focus on the numbers on the scale, but also on the various indicators in a thick pile of physical examination reports. Even if one item exceeds the standard range by a few tenths, you have to pester the doctor to ask questions. Most people of this generation are only children. When dealing with these things, they are not only responsible for themselves, but also cannot let down their parents, even grandparents, who have devoted all their love and expectations to them. At the same time, their physical health and quality of life are also affected. of equal importance. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;So many pairs of eyes are staring directly at me, so many to-do items in life are like putting stones one after another into the basket behind me. It is so wonderful to be able to allocate time and energy to love. not enough. What’s more, anyone who has experienced it knows that it’s not all that worthwhile. It is always the purest when it is budding, and the ambiguity and temptation are thrilling and endlessly fun at every step. The moment the relationship is confirmed, it turns into running-in and management. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;As a prodigal, Lan Ming spoke wildly. Without the constraints of contract and property, a person who can run for ten years and eight years without getting married is definitely not a kind person. This means that in the relationship, at least One party plays the matter of &quot;management&quot; clearly. Susan is already Lan Ming&#39;s longest lover, which only lasted for 18 months. He admitted that without passion, he really had no intention of running the business. &amp;ldquo;So&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;it should be difficult for me to get married. &amp;rdquo;He smiled bitterly. &quot;On the one hand I hope the passion lasts forever, but that&#39;s a fantasy.&quot; But I still want to get married. I hope to hear a &quot;welcome home&quot; in the evening, and because I like children very much, I look forward to witnessing and accompanying a little life as it grows up. &amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Lu Yao clutched the tablecloth tightly, and many story fragments instantly appeared in his mind, and it was impossible to distinguish the true from the false. She recalled a woman who lost control because her child was playing too much and not doing her homework. She cursed loudly for an hour and then turned her anger on her husband. The husband, who had been silent all the time, immediately responded: &quot;This is none of my business!&quot; &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;If Lan Ming’s face is put into this story, it seems to be feasible.但这个女人歇斯底里的模样，应该会让蓝明&amp;ldquo;失去激情&amp;rdquo;吧。这样矛盾又合理的画面惹起了陆谣的攻击性。她开口道：&amp;ldquo;你有没有想过&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;先养条狗试试？ &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;店里的爵士乐好像更大声了，震耳欲聋。蓝明来不及回答，苏珊已经到了。陆谣看着他们彼此问候，像老朋友般自然。她喝下一口酒，如薄刃割喉，惩罚自己的失言。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;散场时雨已经停了。她回到出租屋，为了达成步行上班的梦想，她不惧租金昂贵，也要住在繁华闹市中央。老破小，两室一厅，东西向，早上热完下午热。倚着学校，对着酒吧，白天吵完晚上吵。尤其是周五晚，整座城市积累的压力倾塌在酒吧里惹起阵阵轰鸣，像是她把餐馆里的音乐声也带回了屋子。她将厚重的妆容卸去，淋浴。换上睡衣走出浴室时，一个熟悉至极的男人坐在客厅敲着电脑，侧过头对她笑了一下，道：&amp;ldquo;我回来了。 &amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;陆谣站在原地凝睇他。是啊。蓝明口中那个&amp;ldquo;绝非善类&amp;rdquo;的人不就是自己吗。基因遗传下来的计研心算，与面前这个男人谈了十年恋爱，相伴的意义早已比什么都大，都有用。他从朋友变恋人，再变成分摊房租的室友，出差了近两个月，彼此还记得对方的存在。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;好像就足够了。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;她对他说，欢迎回家。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;她走进西边的卧室，完成都市白领的护肤必修课，躺上床，窗外还能看见月亮。她想起想摘荔枝的父亲，但并不想知道最后他有没有摘到。她想Chris应该已经落地了，他的家人应该会对他说一声欢迎回家。散场的时候蓝明和苏珊还要单独再聊一会儿，他们的话题应该和三岛由纪夫无关。但这一切都和她没有什么关系，或许七乐彩开奖还可能和自己有关。她曾跟Chris提起自己偶尔买彩票，周五晚九点半左右开奖，她就赌一次永生不必再上班的机会。她半梦半醒间想，他应该不会把这样一句轻飘飘的话记住吧。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;思绪停在这里。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;再睁眼时也不过凌晨三点钟，恋人在东边的卧室鼾声如雷。她起身，遵循现代人习惯看了一眼手机，有一条两小时前的留言格外显眼。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;彩票有中吗？ &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;她笑了，将消息标为未读，决定醒来再接这个球，让它足够漂亮。 &lt;/p>;&lt;/p>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;Editor-in-charge: Li Jialong&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Please see @ONE Studio’s pinned Weibo for information on the call for papers.
