My universe was smiling at me.&quot;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(128, 128, 128);&quot;>;Oreo Funduoduo, male, 23 years old&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The last time my heart fell in love was in high school, when we had a crush on each other But the boy who didn&#39;t express it to each other was helping the teacher distribute the papers. As soon as I looked up, our eyes met. He stared straight at me, his eyes bright. It was as if time had stopped at that time. The various noisy sounds became the background, and then we quickly looked away from each other in embarrassment. My heart was beating fast. Later, I was not brave enough, and the people I met again did not feel this way. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&quot;It felt like a complete electric shock, my scalp was numb, and time stopped at that moment.&quot;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(128, 128, 128 );&quot;>;Human Observer, female, 25 years old&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;She said we are soulmates. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&quot;Heartbeat and surprise, like meeting another me in the world.&quot;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(128, 128, 128);&quot;>;Ka Pibala, male, 27 years old&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Received a call from the person I like. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&quot;I was very happy to receive his call, because I didn&#39;t want to miss anything about him. I had been looking forward to it since that morning, until the phone screen turned on, and I pressed answer in a panic in the library. Key, the library is very quiet, his voice is very clear, the girl opposite seems to have heard it, she smiled at me, I blushed inexplicably, I lowered my head and smiled while putting on my headphones, listening carefully to every word you said &quot;Being with you is never forced.&quot; The last sentence made me unable to recover for a long time. The phone had been hung up, but his voice seemed to be still in my ears.&quot;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(128, 128, 128);&quot;>;Qi Yousili, female, 22 years old&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;To be honest, go ahead The first time I was excited was when I saw the handsome guy with abs in Xiaohongshu (I have a boyfriend and I have never seen handsome guys online before). &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&quot;I wish he were my boyfriend.&quot;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(128, 128, 128);&quot;>;Long moment, female, 23 Years old&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;At that moment, a stranger held an umbrella for me for two hours. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&quot;I was moved with a hint of heartbeat.&quot;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(128, 128, 128);&quot;>;Nan Lu 14, female, 20 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Our desks are facing each other, and he always likes to take the pen from my pen holder through the computer. One day he yelled that he didn&#39;t have any more pens. I smiled and took one out of the pen holder to give it to him. As a result, he just reached out to take it from my pen holder, and then at that moment of dislocation, his hand pinched He took my finger and pulled it gently, and my heart seemed to be pulled to his side. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&quot;Heartbeat, there are many more things like this. He would just call me and say how sleepy he was in a lazy voice that he had just woken up. He would also come close to my computer when he was looking at files. He hugged me at work and asked me to go to dinner and buy flowers with me. But the heartbeat lasted for a moment. There is no future between two people. We are eight years apart. I don’t want to give it to others in the ambiguity. Providing emotional value, losing self-esteem and self-love. Ambiguity is too cheap, and I am too precious. No matter how troubled my heart is, I am not even interested in playing with him in reality.&quot;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb (128, 128, 128);&quot;>;Yangyang, female, 22 years old&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I sat opposite her and looked at her for a long time, thinking in my mind Nothing happened. At that time, I just thought that she was very beautiful when she was reading. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&quot;I feel that life is wonderful. I just want to watch her study like this every time after her shift in the library. She is really the kind of person who is not particularly outstanding in appearance but is very interesting to watch. I don’t know if everyone will believe in love at first sight, but I have always firmly believed that love at first sight exists.&quot;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(128, 128, 128);&quot;>;Every lamp meets you, Male, 19 years old&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Let’s do experiments together, and his playlist is played to &quot;Tomorrow and Saturday, we can change our hanging out together to let&#39;s go on a date.&quot; ?”. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&quot;I felt crushed instantly, and now I am my boyfriend.&quot;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(128, 128, 128);&quot;>;Hahaha, female , 24 years old&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Watching the flag-raising ceremony in Tiananmen Square with her. Because the crowd was crowded, I offered to use my hands to help her and she jumped up. You can see the honor guard brigade. Only after this action was actually carried out did I realize that it was holding hands! &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;「&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;」&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(128, 128, 128);&quot;>;Dieafk, male, 22 years old&lt;/span>;&lt;/ p>;&lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;He said he liked my ring, so he took it off my thumb and put it directly on his left ring finger. I asked him what it meant and he said he knew. , why not just get married? He talked a lot about the future. He said he asked me to give it to him, and he would wear it until he got married and buy a more expensive and bigger one before replacing it. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&quot;It&#39;s so heartwarming hahaha.&quot;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(128, 128, 128);&quot;>;Little stubborn ya, female, 22 years old&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(128, 128, 128);&quot;>; span>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;A netizen who I have known for a few months gave me a special product from his place, as well as books and notebooks, as well as a Little Prince stereo. The total number of gifts I have received in my entire life is far greater. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&quot;It really brings tears to my eyes. I feel like I am valued and cared about. I feel that I am not so lonely. Someone will silently care about you and care about your thoughts and feelings.&quot; &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(128, 128, 128);&quot;>;Dandelion, male, 28 years old&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;When I met an ambiguous boy for the first time, I chose to take a walk. There were only a few street lights on the road, and we walked side by side, chatting about our recent work and life, aimlessly and with a strong sense of companionship. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&quot;They say a date starts with a walk. After it was over, I asked him: &quot;You didn&#39;t even praise me. It&#39;s the first time I&#39;m so brave.&quot; He thought for a while and said: &quot;Then I&#39;m very lucky.&amp;rdquo;&quot;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(128, 128, 128);&quot;>;Laila, female, 24 years old&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Wake up and see your boyfriend sleeping beside you. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&quot;After being together for six years, I am still moved by his good looks. Maybe one day I will lose my memory and fall in love with him again. It is not easy to meet someone who is attracted to you. You must cherish it. Heartbeat will be a powerful weapon to overcome the trivial matters in life (my boyfriend is not only good at my aesthetics, but also has a very good personality. The saying starts with appearance and is loyal to character).&quot;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;span style =&quot;color: rgb(128, 128, 128);&quot;>;Pan, female, 29 years old&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Watching the fireworks show at a Halloween amusement park, I couldn&#39;t see the fireworks, so my boyfriend let me sit on his shoulders and watch. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&quot;I suddenly stood in the dark crowd to the highest place with the best view. Watching the fireworks with the person I love the most is very romantic~ My boyfriend is also working hard, thank you.&quot;&lt;/p>; p>;&lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(128, 128, 128);&quot;>;Bai Yujing Fengchen, female, 27 years old&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;A knitted rose. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&quot;On the eve of Valentine&#39;s Day, I was walking in the park with my mother. There were many stalls selling flowers. What caught my attention were the knitted flowers. They were beautiful and delicate. Then I blamed my mother for the other flowers. Girls all have flowers for Valentine&#39;s Day, but I didn&#39;t... A few months later, my mother sent me a video of her knitting a rose for me. At that moment, it was like your casual words were remembered. Even though I was shocked, I took action. The moved tears will remain...&quot;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(128, 128, 128);&quot;>;Gu Yu, female, 25 years old &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I talked to my friends about how I was trampled by cows many times when I was a child. Now adults will still tease me and say that I have a hard life. Most people are already dead, my friend. But with tears in his eyes, he gave me a big hug. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&quot;I am very touched. It turns out that someone really feels sorry for what you have experienced.&quot;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(128, 128, 128);&quot; >;Wan&#39;er, female, 23 years old&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Pear blossoms were floating on our shoulders. My friend said to come closer and look at the camera! &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&quot;I felt like I was eating a ripe plum. I had been held back because of the sourness of the skin. Fortunately, I ate a plum that made my heart beat that spring.&quot;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(128, 128, 128);&quot;>;Yu Yuyu, female, 17 years old&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Go in the morning I bought breakfast in the school cafeteria. When I swiped my meal card, my uncle called my name and said it sounded very nice. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&quot;I&#39;m so happy. I woke up in a daze this morning.&quot;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(128, 128, 128);&quot;>;婠婠, Female, 22 years old&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;He came close to me and smelled my hair. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&quot;At that time, I felt my heart beating faster and I was very happy.&quot;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(128, 128, 128);&quot;>;Nine, female, 28 years old &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The studio is on holiday on Monday, but there are always a few people staying to take pictures. At that time, when he knew that I was staying alone in the studio at night, he was the studio The first place winner, he immediately rushed over without saying a word and gave me one-on-one guidance on painting. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&quot;I was so excited and surprised that my heart was moved.&quot;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(128, 128, 128);&quot;>;zoey, female, 18 years old&lt; /span>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;My boyfriend from a different place sent me pictures to check in after a workout, and suddenly said, &quot;It&#39;s nice to have someone I like in my heart.&quot; &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&quot;The corners of my mouth could not help but rise. In fact, it was just a very ordinary love word, a very ordinary afternoon, but overflowing with joy across the phone and distance, I suddenly felt that after being together for so long, I would still be... With just one sentence, I felt like I was still a little girl with fresh emotions, who had not been flattened by life. At that moment, I felt that I had no problem with this long-distance relationship even if it took a long time.&quot;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt; span style=&quot;color: rgb(128, 128, 128);&quot;>;Yu&#39;er, female, 23 years old&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;&lt;/p>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;Editor in charge: Mei Butan onewenti @wufazhuce.com&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For information about the call for submissions, please see the @ONE Studio pinned on Weibo.

This article starts from the perspective of a express box, walks through all living beings, and tastes the joys, sorrows, joys, anger, and ignorance of an ordinary family. &lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;1&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I spent the first half of my life in chaos, with machines rumbling loudly and violence kneading them into cubes. A heavy thing was thrown into my body, and then it was sealed with a thick ring of tape. Not to mention, a big hand with thick dirt hidden between the nails had a note attached to it. I threw it away and it got stuck on both sides. In the middle of a big box. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;You are new, you must be a big company. There was a tattered small box under his feet. He frowned and muttered like a mantra, &quot;I may be recycled after this trip.&quot; &quot;It was covered with express delivery notes, one covering the other. The top layer said &quot;Disposable Toilet Mat&quot; and the address was Liwan Hotel. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I didn’t adapt to the world. I glanced at the boxes around me and spoke very little. The big truck made rhythmic white noise, which was suitable for sleeping with my eyes squinted. The toilet seat box was chatty, and looked at me again, thinking, the weight loss pill must be a woman, the woman is good, we will not be violent when trying to break it. Pinge community is a low-end, government-owned low-rent housing for rural residents. I have been to the most upscale Huasong City. You don’t know, the security guards don’t let the couriers in. They put a courier cabinet at the door. It’s clean and smells good. Wipe every day. I was also brand new at that time, it was an YSL wallet, you know, the girl is pretty, when she saw the dress on me, her eyebrows were smiling, her nails were thin and pointed, she carefully tore off the tape - you will know those men later, shua If you tear it violently, it will only hurt. It will break quickly and you will not be able to receive good orders. Forget it, forget it, go to sleep, there is a long way to go... Toilet Seat Box talks like an old lady, dancing slowly to the lyrics, pausing after speaking for a while, immersed in her own story. I don’t know if the long road it talks about means that the truck will travel thousands of kilometers or that as a brand-new box, I will experience a long life from an international brand to an unknown toilet seat. My thoughts are flying far away, and I listen to the breathing of the boxes. Actually fell asleep. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;It was thrown onto the trolley by a big hand again, turned over several times, hit a corner, and was dented in two corners. The toilet seat box has long since disappeared. I pray that it can still take two more orders, although the box body Already limp and shapeless. The small car changed to three wheels. The experienced old box said that it would be liberating when I heard the phone call. Sure enough, in the afternoon I heard &quot;the last number is 9702&quot;, the voice of a young girl. Before I could feel lucky, I was with five people. The box came into her hand together, as soft as jade, she held the knife in her fingers, gently opened the tape, glanced at the weight loss pills, and then complained, Mom, weight loss pills are all lies, shut up and move your legs. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;A rough hand took it and put me and the weight loss pills into the canvas bag that I brought with me. Your aunt took it usefully, and her tone was obviously meant to please the daughter of the new era. My daughter is still nagging, and this time there is some love in the complaint. From their words, I learned that my owner, whose tail number is 9702, has stomach problems. My daughter is getting married soon, so she bought weight loss pills. She is eyeing the red cheongsam. I don’t plan to throw it away in the express box, which can be stored. . &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;2&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I am luckier than most express boxes. They often receive several orders from production to recycling, but are thrown in by different owners. Trash can, slide all the way down, follow the box-set life. Because of the frugality of the low-rent housing residents, I became a storage box for her family, realizing a class leap. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;9702&#39;s hands were full of calluses, but his fingers were thick and short but extremely dexterous. He used the scissors up and down to accurately cut off my box lid. He took out the small &quot;Happy&quot; from the cabinet full of wedding supplies and stuck it on until it was gone. On the express delivery side, a few inferior bionic roses were inserted, placing me at the top of the cabinet with a good view. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;9702 is a typical rural woman. She cannot type and can only send voice messages. She chats with some aunt or sister for two or three hours almost every night. Obviously, the recent topic is her daughter who is about to get married. 9702&#39;s mother is over eighty and wants to bring over her dowry box. It is made of walnut wood. 9702 expresses the same disgust as her daughter. Who still uses broken boxes now? They can only be stored in warehouses. Don&#39;t worry about it anymore. The silver bracelets are also No, you have worn it for decades, and dad is gone, so the bracelet will stay with you. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;This interesting story was told to sister 9702, and the two laughed. They recalled that when they were children, they did something wrong. The sister hid in a walnut dowry box. The whole family had a hard time finding it. After she found it, they all came together with sticks and brooms to beat her. My butt was swollen for three days. Perhaps God was punishing his cruel parents. A month later, 9702&#39;s only brother died due to a fever, leaving only two daughters in the family. 9702 Dad gave birth to a son at an advanced age, and half of his life was suddenly taken away. He said that he had no children and died without a son. He would be bullied. After saying this, both 9702 and his sister were silent for a long time. Finally, the sister said that she wanted to burn some paper for her dad. She had dreamed about him some time ago and was living well. She just wanted to drink some millet soup. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I was sleeping that night and was awakened by the rustling sound in the kitchen. 9702 was making porridge. He grabbed a handful of rice with his short hands and washed it three times. He put half a pot of water in the pot and sat on the small table. While waiting on the stool for the porridge to be ready, she didn&#39;t look at her phone or do anything else. She just stayed on the stool and watched the flames of the gas stove flicker. The last bowl of porridge was taken out in the early morning, and the other bowl became my daughter’s breakfast. Mom, how did you make the millet soup? It’s so mushy and delicious. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;3&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;9702 My husband showed up on the third day after I arrived home. He was wearing a coal miner&#39;s jacket, with black cinders under his fingernails. Man, after taking a shower, he changed clothes, lit a cigarette, and took two puffs, only to find that there was no ashtray on the coffee table. His eyes scanned around the house, and settled on me. He stood up, took me down, and threw the bionic flower aside. , the ash is not hot, but if the cigarette butt is thrown in for a while, I&#39;m afraid I will end up in the trash can tonight. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;9702 My daughter came back first and said hello, Dad, you are finished. My mother made a specially made vase. She doesn&#39;t like me either. Young girls can&#39;t stand the frugality of the older generation who make the most of everything. Her father was a typical man of few words. He did not respond to the teasing and took two puffs to knock off the ashes. His daughter seemed to be used to this kind of silence and shrugged imperceptibly. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The door opened when there was only a moment left. Full of soot, I gave up the hope of becoming a vase and only hoped to be able to store some miscellaneous items. 9702’s stubby eyebrows stood up and he snatched it away. I ran to the trash can and emptied it out, and blew for a long time. The ash drifted into her eyes, and she kept complaining and being lazy. The ash was under the coffee table. She only looked at the face without looking inside. The new box contained flowers. Specially posted the word &quot;Happy&quot;. The husband didn&#39;t say anything, and still smoked in silence. The daughter poked her head out of the bedroom door to watch the fun, and took out a few dried roses, cut them short with scissors, and put 9702 in the box. She sat next to her husband and rolled her eyes. He took out three more happy words. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;9702 got the three-joy vase and five red roses, and my eyebrows stretched straight up. Not only did I escape the disaster, but it also became one of the most festive items in the house. In my daughter’s words, I have a sense of accomplishment. The retro beauty of the 1990s, I couldn&#39;t understand the sincerity and hypocrisy in human words. I could only vaguely feel the disdain of the new era towards the old era. 9702 was completely unaware of it, and smiled happily and glanced at her husband again. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The wedding process is trivial. Who should be invited, what wine should be served, and what cigarettes should be used. If 9702’s question is answered silently, it means yes. If the husband speaks out, it means no. When you ask why no , there was another silence. 9702 was obviously adapted to this way of communication. He guessed a few reasons for the no and waited for his husband&#39;s silent confirmation. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I looked down at the rather weird couple from a high place, and it felt more uncomfortable than being pricked by a dry rose thorn. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Before going to bed, 9702 took out the red cheongsam, with the tag still on. The satin surface had a warm luster under the yellow living room lamp, and the button was a plump pearl. 9702 stood in front of the mirror. The man who is nearly 50 years old has not much hair but a large waist. He is looking at the folk singer in his hand. He looks up and says that the old lady is still dressed up. 9702 glared at him, muttered that it was none of your business, took out the 3cm red high heels from the shoe cabinet, put them on, took two steps back, pinched the fat on his belly, took out the weight loss pills from the cabinet, and took them Swallow the water. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Next to me is a black and white photo of 9702 when he was young. He was about 24 or 25 years old, with two thick braids hanging on his plump chest, and a slim cheongsam pinched out of his waist. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;4&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The festive things in the low-rent house were moved out at noon on the fourth day. Several young girls came in, chirping and calling uncles and aunts. The 9702 daughter was like a coordinator. This rose pink happy word was stuffed in the trunk, and the Chinese round fan must be packed. A heavy box of artificial flowers was held by the silent father. Go downstairs. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The reserved 9702 was boiling water in the kitchen and making tea for the young birds. The aroma of tea lingered in the small living room, but the delivery man brought seven cups of milk tea. The little bird with a high ponytail said to 9702, Auntie envies your good son-in-law. The laughter filled the low-rent house. 9702 also laughed. He wanted to say something but was worried about his clumsy tongue. He only said one sentence, drink less of that stuff. Not good for your stomach. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;After the house faded away little by little, and the eye-catching red color disappeared, I noticed that there were long cracks in the wall of the living room. There were residues under the sofa near the window that had been burned by the sun for many years. It looked like the sockets had been cleaned. But the old dirt in the gaps could not be cleaned away, and the small house became even smaller, crumbling like an old man in his dying years. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;My daughter was the last one to leave. When I turned around and closed the door, she looked at me and took me downstairs, handing over the outdated aesthetics to 9702, here is your beloved box. We went to a hotel, and there were already happy people around. It turned out that we were going to get married in the hotel. The room was big, new, and it would be a decent wedding. Relatives gathered around her, and the loud-voiced aunt in the video made an exaggerated sound, saying that the daughter of a high-ranking person will marry well. 9702’s younger sister was also there. She looked a bit older than in the video, maybe because of her red eyebrows, which made her look red and happy. She scolded what she was holding in her hand, took it over and put it on me. On the hotel window sill. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;At midnight, the young girls carefully decorated the hotel with happy birthday, pearls and flowers, beautiful and exquisite desserts, and balloons into the originally gray and black hotel. Someone came over to pick me up and put me down again. , took out the small artificial flowers from the box at the door again, and placed them on the bedside table. 9702 Chatting with female relatives, it is nothing more than that when I was young, the dowry was a big box with a shiny green surface and clusters of peonies painted on it. When the box was opened, there was a red washbasin, a red ceramic cup, and red socks. The rich ones She also accompanied her with a gold bracelet, which made a bunch of sisters jealous. The bracelet had to be worn, and in bad times there were many thieves. Who knows which of the relatives and friends might have their own evil intentions. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The voice became quieter in the second half of the night, and she fell asleep unsteadily. 9702 didn’t sleep at all. I heard her chatting with her sister, and her voice was vague and unclear. A few words floated over, &quot;consummation&quot;, just like that person, the millet porridge was cooked. The curtains were not drawn, and the all-night light from the opposite side shone on 9702&#39;s bare feet, which were thick with calluses. She quietly went in and out of her daughter&#39;s suite, over and over again, and came back and sat on the window sill, constantly looking at the time. The screen of her mobile phone highlighted the She had a thick, rural woman&#39;s face, just like that night when she was cooking millet porridge, she just sat there. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;9702 got up at 3:30 in the morning and quietly opened the door. Ten minutes later, the makeup artist came in pushing a big box. The photographer and photographer rushed in carrying equipment. I don’t know whose leather shoes stepped on it. I, the dry rose made a crisp cracking sound, my senses were almost useless, I could only vaguely remember that before I closed my eyes, 9702 still had no shoes on. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Noisy, firecrackers, girls chirping, high heels stepping on me again and again. When everything calmed down, it was probably the broom that threw me and the rose into the trash can. I didn’t see many people, didn’t take a few orders, but I feel that box life has been long enough, and I am glad that I only need to take one order in my life. &lt;/p>;&lt;/p>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;Editor-in-charge: Mei Butan&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Please see @ONE Studio’s pinned Weibo for information on the call for papers.
