At that age, you can get married, take a driving license, and join the army. . Like a clear border separating the two sides. But this is not the case in the heart. Some people reach adulthood early, and some people may not understand what adults should bear when they are old. Adulthood may be an epiphany at a certain moment in life. &lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The moment when I feel I truly became an adult was when my dad was out of town and his finger was cut off while operating a machine. I had to handle all the hospital matters by myself. procedures, the moment you sign the surgery consent form. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(128, 128, 128);&quot;>;Endless, 25 years old, freelance writer&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;br>;&lt;/ p>;&lt;p>;The moment when I realized that I couldn’t be a painter. I am an art student. When I was a child, I always had unrealistic fantasies about art. I always wanted to compete with Picasso, Van Gogh, Matisse and so on. But I really learned this profession. I soon woke up. I rely on painting. If you can&#39;t support yourself, let alone become a famous person, you are destined not to leave your name in the long history. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(128, 128, 128);&quot;>;Xiao Ming, 23 years old, confused&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the Spring Festival this year, my father drank with me and shed tears. He gave me all the bankbooks and passwords at home, and said that you can go on your own the rest of the way (he still has his current family). He said that he always Yes, I said, you have to grow up quickly. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;In late spring, my mother fell ill, my stepfather broke his back, and the family had no income. My younger brother was admitted to a good middle school, but because of money, they were still hesitant to go back to their hometown to attend an ordinary school. Because my mother never gave me money when I was studying a few years ago, she has always been very sensitive to this word in front of me, probably because of guilt. When I visited them, although they were disappointed, they never mentioned these things. It was my younger brother who told me. I didn&#39;t want to let my mother go because I didn&#39;t know when I would see her again when she returned to Northeast China. I wanted to help, but she refused. In the end, my younger brother stayed in that good middle school. My mother told me that I hope you will do something serious soon. You are not young anymore. She talks about serious things, which are valuable things. My father, my mother, my stepfather and my stepmother have never bought social security. They started to panic. I realized that they were really getting old, so my mother’s eyes were hard for me to escape. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;So this year I made some money, the balance on my card increased, I bought a car, and the cigarettes I smoked became more expensive, and I seemed to have really become a decent adult. But I have been internally consumed. Everything before has collapsed. Now I have to learn how to get along with myself and life again as an adult. This is a difficult problem that makes me impetuous and unable to write a complete article for a long time. article is still dealing with this issue. I never thought that this would be the biggest challenge in this year. Being an adult is not cool at all. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(128, 128, 128);&quot;>;Tang Chong, 24 years old, a young man from a small town&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;br>;&lt;/ p>;&lt;p>;The first time I said &quot;no&quot; to my parents. I have endured all kinds of arrangements since I was a child. They even decided my major in college, and I have tolerated it. But if I still want to decide who I will marry, I have to say no. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(128, 128, 128);&quot;>;Ms. Du, 25 years old, teacher&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The first time I broke up, I felt that the first time I fell in love was not the moment of adulthood, but the first time I broke up, the breakup made me understand far more than falling in love. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(128, 128, 128);&quot;>;White-faced Pipa, 29 years old, programmer&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p >;&lt;p>;Only after working and leaving society did I realize that the belief and value system I had been taught for more than ten years collapsed in just a few months. I understood what it means to say one thing and do another. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(128, 128, 128);&quot;>;Hema Buxin, 31 years old, working as a worker&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;br>;&lt; /p>;&lt;p>;Physically, he has already reached adulthood. Psychologically, maybe because I didn’t have a family, I was still a little short of true adulthood. Maybe it has nothing to do with starting a family, but the difference is the room deliberately left for curiosity and naivety. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(128, 128, 128);&quot;>;Yi Chaonan, 41 years old, author&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p >;&lt;p>;I think &quot;making decisions&quot; is a criterion for dividing growth stages. When I was a child, my parents made all the decisions for me. When I was in middle school, I started to have &quot;self&quot; and wanted to make my own decisions, but I didn&#39;t have the ability. After I started working, the connection with my parents gradually weakened, and we each took responsibility for our own lives. Until now, my parents have retired and my physical functions have gradually declined. I have begun to take on the responsibility of caring, judging, and making decisions for the entire family... When I found that my parents and I had completely reversed roles, I realized that I really Coming of age. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(128, 128, 128);&quot;>;Xiao Taofeng, 34 years old, media practitioner&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;br>;&lt;/ p>;&lt;p>;I am thinking that growth and adulthood seem to be separated. Growth is silent, unconscious, and gradual, but the word adult always reminds you of a special node. On my 18th birthday, I found out that my parents had been divorced for two years behind my back. At the age of 19, I drove more than ten hours back to my hometown room alone. It was devastated, with three floors inside and three outside the spider web. The county hotel was full that night, so I slept on the sofa in the Internet cafe all night. At the age of 22, I returned to Sichuan without getting a single offer. I lived in an eight-square-meter single room near the airport with food stalls downstairs. At the age of 23, he became a graduate student in the Chinese Department and moved from the southernmost part of Chengdu to the northernmost part. At the age of 24, a good friend passed away and I drove alone all night on Binhe Road in my hometown. At the age of 26, I had my first formal job, a fixed place of residence, many new friends, and a brand new journey. Adulthood is really a very subjective thing. It is so subjective that you can’t even give it a specific definition. If you ask me, even though I am almost 30, I am still on the way to that end. Every ten years. I feel the dream of Yangzhou, but my boat has not yet crossed the Ten Thousand Mountains! &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(128, 128, 128);&quot;>;Chen Gong, 26 years old, office worker&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p >;&lt;p>;When I got my first salary. I need to allocate its functions reasonably, including rent, food expenses, pocket money, and some of it must be saved. For the first time, I have the feeling of supporting myself and being able to pay for all my own expenses. This is when I have truly grown up. At that moment, I became an independent person, a point from which I could radiate relationships outwards from myself. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(128, 128, 128);&quot;>;Kitou, 28 years old, human resources&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I feel like I&#39;m an adult at the age of 15. The teacher didn&#39;t like me, and I didn&#39;t get along well with my classmates because I was introverted. I had to handle all my affairs by myself when I lived on campus. My parents thought they wouldn&#39;t have to worry about it if they sent me to live on campus. I had to take care of myself, and I had to look at the teacher’s face when asking for leave. When I saw other students rushing to the canteen after class, I lost the desire to eat. Those were harder days than working now. I am emotionally more stable and calm than my peers because I experienced the process of adulthood ahead of time. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(128, 128, 128);&quot;>;Aiming at the bullseye, 31 years old, ordinary employee&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p >;&lt;p>;When you have your own kitten. My parents didn’t want to keep a cat, but they couldn’t resist me, so they let me trade my labor for everything about the cat. Washing dishes, preparing dishes, doing laundry, mopping the floor, wiping the table...I got everything for the kitten, while also taking on the responsibility of fully caring for the kitten. Only when you can fulfill your responsibilities and obligations well can you really grow up. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(128, 128, 128);&quot;>;An Miaoer, 26 years old, bank clerk&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;br>;&lt;/ p>;&lt;p>;After breaking up with a once-close friend. I am a pleaser personality, and I am also a person with no independent opinions. I will do whatever my friends ask me to do. I enjoy this feeling of being needed. I forget what happened, we just stopped playing together, and then I started to grow up alone. When I was at home, I relied on my parents, when I was at school, I relied on my friends, but later I had to rely on myself and had to give my own ideas. This is a very good thing. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(128, 128, 128);&quot;>;Kerr, 23 years old, wild painter&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;br>;&lt;/ p>;&lt;p>;The first time I was exploited for labor + wages by the boss of my internship company. There is a saying, &quot;We are all still naive when it comes to people.&quot; &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(128, 128, 128);&quot;>;Xiao Zhou, 25 years old, reporter&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;br>;&lt;/ p>;&lt;p>;After work, I go home during the Spring Festival. I find that there are fewer and fewer things that I can talk to my parents about. They can no longer help me with my problems as they once did. I have to face the future by myself. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(128, 128, 128);&quot;>;Rosemary, 25 years old, programmer&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The idol I was once very obsessed with was coming to my city to hold a concert. I looked at the amount of savings in my hand and felt that there was no fluctuation in my heart. Only then did I realize that these idols had gradually faded out of my life. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(128, 128, 128);&quot;>;degradable straw, 26 years old, photographer&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;&lt;/p>; &lt;/div>; &lt; p>;Editor in charge: Zhou Ziheng onewenti@wufazhuce.com&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For information on the call for papers, please see the @ONE Studio pinned on Weibo. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Respondent&lt;/p>; &lt;hr/>; &lt;table>; &lt;tr>; &lt;td style=&quot;width: 50px;&quot;>; &lt;img src=&quot;http://image.wufazhuce.com/FmgDdOBenMvH6G69S5THIANm6xm8 &quot; alt=&quot;ONE friend&quot;>; &lt;/td>; &lt;td>; &lt;div>;ONE friend&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10px&quot;>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div style=&quot;&quot;>;Complex The cutest people in the world&lt;/div>; &lt;/td>; &lt;td width=&quot;60px&quot;>; &lt;!-- &lt;span onclick=&quot;OneAPP.openDetail(4, )&quot;>;Follow&lt;/span>; -->; &lt; /td>; &lt;/tr>; &lt;/table>; &lt;p>;Related recommendations&lt;/p>; &lt;hr/>; &lt;table>; &lt;tr>; &lt;td style=&quot;width: 40px;&quot;>; &lt;span>;Q&amp;A&lt;/span>; &lt; /td>; &lt;td>; &lt;a href=&quot;/question/3980&quot; data-ajax=&quot;false&quot;>; &lt;div>;Have you ever been &quot;emotionally blackmailed&quot;? &lt;/div>; &lt;div style=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/div>; &lt;/a>; &lt;/td>; &lt;/tr>; &lt;tr>; &lt;td style=&quot;width: 40px;&quot;>; &lt;span>;Q&amp;A&lt;/span>; &lt; /td>; &lt;td>; &lt;a href=&quot;/question/3981&quot; data-ajax=&quot;false&quot;>; &lt;div>;What worries does &quot;E-man&quot; have? &lt;/div>; &lt;div style=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/div>; &lt;/a>; &lt;/td>; &lt;/tr>; &lt;/table>; &lt;table>; &lt;tr>; &lt;td>;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align:center ;padding:5px;&quot; onclick=&quot;OneAPP.openDetail(4,3982)&quot;>;Click to download ONE app&lt;/div>;&lt;/td>; &lt;/tr>; &lt;/table>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 20 Nov 2023 06:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[李开心和十五只猫]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://m.wufazhuce.com/article/6167]]><description> &lt;div>;20 Nov. 2023&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;main&quot;>; &lt;div>; &lt;p>;Text/Wasteland Orange&lt;/p>; &lt;div>; &lt;p>;&lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;&lt; div contenteditable=&quot;false&quot;>;&lt;img data-author=&quot;&quot; data-original-src=&quot;http://image.wufazhuce.com/Fvwii-28iuyfQBwloABgeSiax-cI&quot; data-source=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http:/ /image.wufazhuce.com/Fvwii-28iuyfQBwloABgeSiax-cI&quot;>;&lt;/div>;&lt;div>;&lt;div style=&quot;font-size:26px;line-height: 1;&quot;>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Earth Not only does it belong to humans, it is also home to animals. Faced with kittens that were abandoned due to whims and selfish interests, Li Kaixin and her friends took the initiative to shoulder a responsibility that should be shared by the whole society. &lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;(1) &quot;Artificial Lake&quot; Four Brothers&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Adopted by Li Kaixin Eighteen cats. These cats live in groups of two and three, forming cliques. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The most eye-catching one and the most troublesome for Li Kaixin is the orange cat gang - because they are the largest in number, the orange cats like to go around in groups to provoke other gangs, and they will pull their paws apart when they rush over. Great war. For a time, the whole room was filled with fur of various colors. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The civet cat gang, on the other hand, keeps a low profile and never makes enemies. Among the four civet cats, one has one eye and one has one arm. The four are similar in age and have timid personalities. They spend most of their time huddled under the bed. Be flamboyant and not noisy. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;There are also some breeds of cats that have been abandoned, such as Garfield with a nasal branch, Ragdoll with a belly, and a cat that the cleaning aunt in the community brought in despite the heavy rain last month. The beautiful shorthair that was just born. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;It was raining steadily that day. My aunt wore a disposable raincoat and covered the box with a layer of rain-proof film. She walked through half the neighborhood and knocked on her door hurriedly: Xiao Li, You should also accept this nest. It&#39;s too small for me to feed. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Before the arrival of this litter of kittens, Li Kaixin had only fourteen cats in his home. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;She looked through the translucent film and saw four little things with eyes that had not yet opened, stacked softly together like Jenga. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;She was a little embarrassed. Fourteen cats have consumed most of her energy in daily life, and fifteen cats is the bottom line she has set for herself. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;This is no longer a problem of just one, but a whole litter. What&#39;s more, it&#39;s a litter that requires feeding every two hours and artificial stimulation of urination every four hours. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;She can only accept one more milk cat at most. She was thinking in her mind whether this month&#39;s salary would be enough. Adopting one of them could only be said to be barely enough... But obviously, Li Kaixin could barely do it. , Auntie absolutely cannot accept it. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The aunt was so anxious that she looked at her and the kittens for a while, shaking her head almost like a rattle. Because we came here in the rain, the raindrops on the tips of our hair also fell on the middle of the film drop by drop. As the small pits in the film slid down and gathered together, they became a small artificial lake. Looking across this artificial lake, the kittens huddled up in a ball and slept peacefully. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;This aunt is responsible for the garbage classification, cleaning and management of the garbage station in Li Kaixin Community. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;There are also some stray cats in the community, and the garbage station is one of their bases. There is an orange cat that raises its tail and follows Auntie all day long. Although it is not afraid of people, it is not very affectionate and always keeps close contact with Auntie. A safe distance of three to five meters. When the aunt was sorting the garbage, it stayed far away. When the aunt went to collect plastic bottles in the community, it followed her step by step. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Auntie will buy some ham sausages to feed, and she will also buy some cheap cat food from a nearby supermarket and pour it into bowls for the nearby cats to help themselves. Occasionally, she will also ask the owner’s sister who is more familiar with her to help the cats in the community. Asking for help in the friend group: Does anyone have extra cat food? Can anyone send some if there is not enough? &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Li Kaixin often packs up some cat food and canned food and sends them over. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;In the rainy season, the garbage station leaked, and the rainwater seeped into the cartons and water bottles that Auntie had stored. When rescuing the warehouse, Auntie accidentally discovered this litter of abandoned kittens. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;After sending away his aunt, Li Kaixin was worried about the litter of kittens. The dozen or so big cats in the house were extremely excited and very curious about the four new little things. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Go, go, winter melon, go away. Li Kaixin pushed a cat away with his left hand, and opened the milk powder and bottles he bought with his right hand. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Li Kaixin borrowed a large cage from the rescue group in the same city and could arrive in the afternoon. This litter looks healthy, but they are too young and have not been weaned. Li Kaixin plans to raise them at home before taking them to the hospital for a physical examination. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The city group is not large, with only twenty or thirty rescuers. There are not many full-time rescuers. Most of them are people like Li Kaixin who do rescue work in their spare time while working. Most of them are old ladies who pick up rags on the streets in their later years. They accidentally pick up cats and pick up more and more cats. them. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Li Kaixin has been working as a rescuer for only three years, and ranks last among the group. She cannot compare with the old ladies who have been living with stray cats since ten years ago. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Although she is not very good at using WeChat, old ladies often share videos of cats in the group. In real life, old ladies are also the kind who open the door and see a dozen cats of different colors. Cats came from all over to meet the big rescuers. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;People in this group help each other, share rescue supplies with each other, and pass on rescue and adoption information in the same city to each other. After going back and forth, everyone knows who is under the vest. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The cage was lent to her by Snowball. Xueqiu saw the video of &quot;Four Brothers in an Artificial Lake&quot; posted by Li Kaixin in the group, and immediately called him: &quot;Xueqiu, don&#39;t you want to keep it under fifteen?&quot; This is just a litter of kittens. Do you want to become a Buddha immediately? ! Xueqiu sighed while looking at the previous chat page. In the conversation, Li Kaixin asked her last month: &quot;Is there a cat car?&quot; Are there any promotions recently? These fat cats eat a bag of my cat food a week! I can’t afford it! &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;(2) Snowball and her rescue station&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Snowball was doing The cattery is not a very formal one. The cats are all bought from other catteries, so in the beginning I didn’t really have much affection for small animals like cats. People in the industry call their informal cattery business the &quot;living animal business.&quot; &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;How can a living person have much conscience? &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;But after ten years of ups and downs, watching catteries transform from a sunrise industry to a sunset industry, Snowball has experienced too much. Too many customers just throw them away, and too many colleagues are crazy and desperate to breed. When one day I saw a video of my colleagues posting in the group &quot;My breeder was blinded for nothing, and he bred a disabled litter&quot;, I An overwhelming feeling of nausea suddenly filled her stomach. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;After that day, she suddenly closed the cattery. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Except for the two retired breeding mothers that could not be sold, Xueqiu gave away the last batch of kittens she bred in the cattery, leaving only the quilts that were secretly sent to the cattery. Abandoned sick cat. From then on, he embarked on the road of rescue and transformed the &quot;cattery&quot; into an &quot;adoption rescue center&quot;. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;When it first opened, it was very lively. Seven aunts and eight aunts from the nearby community gathered around with their children because of the &quot;free adoption&quot;. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The rescue station also made local social news, attracting a large number of media to interview, and also attracted self-media Internet celebrities to check in. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;During that era, Snowball’s rescue center helped a small group of citizens understand the then-fashionable concept of “adoption instead of purchase.” &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;However, most people still go straight to the breed cats after entering. Five or six years later, in line with the general trend of the market, the breeds of cats in Xueqiu’s rescue center are still the most popular among Chinese people. Of course, Xueqiu’s requirements for adopters are much higher than when they first sold cats. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Neuter, close the window and never abandon the kitten. If the three basic points cannot be achieved, Snowball will not let this person take away any kitten in the rescue center. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;People come and go, and some people come in enthusiastically because it is &quot;free&quot;. Of course, there are also people who leave in a strange way after hearing &quot;sterilization&quot; and &quot;window sealing&quot;. People who post insults online. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;After the craze subsided, the rescue station returned to the same tepid routine as before in the cattery. What was left was Snowball and a room full of old, weak, sick and disabled cats. It was a quiet day after that. It was a quiet five or six years. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Occasionally, a little girl will timidly come in with her mother, shyly pointing at the little guy in the cage and saying: &quot;Mom, can I adopt him?&quot; &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Snowball didn&#39;t care about these ebbs and flows. She was doing the rescue with some remorse. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Somewhere she felt that God was guiding her to atone for her sins. Her past indifference and selfishness, her sin of making money from a cat&#39;s womb, will all be repaid with her snowballing rescue actions in the rest of her life. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;If it doesn’t work, give it to me. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Xueqiu said to the other end of the phone through gritted teeth while changing a diaper for Jin Jianlai, who was paralyzed after falling down from a high-rise building&#39;s window that was not sealed. A month ago, four milk cats would have been nothing to her. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I earned some money when I was a cattery, and now I do some self-media sales, which is enough to maintain the daily life of the rescue station. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;But since I rescued this Golden Grain Layer, the material and mental pressure suddenly increased. This is the second paralyzed cat in the rescue station. There is not much difference between one and two cats. Why has the pressure suddenly increased so much? She often pressed her temples and sighed when she was woken up by Jin Jianlayer&#39;s howling at night. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;However, she can still maintain the current balance of income and expenditure. Li Kaixin, a young nurse, has been unable to make ends meet for more than half a year. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;No need, Sister Xueqiu, you have it hard enough. Wow, you also sent me canned milk cats, and the little ones ate some of them! &amp;rdquo;The person on the other end said happily. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;(3) Li Kaixin’s rescue story&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Li Kaixin is an ordinary little nurse. The rescue started when I picked up a Jianzhou cat soaked in the vomit of an unknown drunkard in the trash can after the night shift one day, and it got out of hand. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I don’t know whether it was because of the nurse’s belief in saving lives and healing the wounded, or because of human compassion and sense of responsibility for weak lives. She began to bring back stray cats one after another into her small rental house. . &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Some were rescued from a trap stall in the night market for 50 yuan, some were collected in the adoption area of ​​the hospital when taking the cat for a physical examination, and some netizens picked up the cat on the roadside. She asked for help. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;In the past three years, she moved twice with her seven or eight cats, from the south to the north of the city, from the third ring road to the suburbs, and finally lived in a one-bedroom apartment with an open-air balcony. She spent the morning sealing the windows of her open-air balcony with wire mesh and plastic film. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The children can finally bask in the sun happily. Li Kaixin was quite satisfied with his site selection level and hands-on ability, although he had several holes in his hands. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Ten cats is a dividing line. Somehow, when Li Kaixin brought the eleventh cat home, she realized that she was doing &quot;rescue&quot; rather than simply raising a pet. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;A home with ten cats is an ordinary cat family. But the home with eleven cats is a rescue cat family. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Like the rescue station opened by Snowball. Starting from this eleventh cat, Li Kaixin suddenly realized that he wanted to find children for adoption. On the one hand, it was because she was just an ordinary nurse and her meager salary could not support her in adopting more cats. On the other hand, the neighbor downstairs complained about being &quot;too loud&quot; and made her a little nervous. She had just moved. , the kids are just getting used to it. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;So she joined the rescue group in the same city, and with the help of Snowball, she began to send away some cats one after another. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The beautiful long-haired orange cat Nian Gao became the fastest adopted child in Li Kaixin’s family; the smartest black cat, Sheriff, was also in demand. She compared and screened three or four rounds of selections. A young lady who owns a big villa becomes a new mother to the police chief. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;These lucky little guys will no longer have to eat from a big pot at her house, nor will they have to move around with her, so they can enjoy happiness in the future. Although she was reluctant to part with it, she was even more pleased. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Of course, there are also those that cannot be adopted. Sick cats, cats with quieter personalities, and disabled cats are relatively less likely to be adopted, such as the one-eyed Xiaoqi, the three-legged cat Lili, and the honest and honest cat. Eye-catching winter melon. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;It doesn’t matter, you still have me. ” Li Kaixin cried and hugged Winter Melon late at night, his nose and tears all rubbing on Winter Melon. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The one who is crying is not herself, the one who is crying is that the fur babies can only follow her to endure hardships. Winter Melon is the second cat she picked up. It has been with her for three years and moved twice. Even her boyfriend, Donggua, stayed with her for two terms. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Why doesn’t anyone want our beautiful big winter melon? What&#39;s wrong with the eyes? They are smart. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Before the artificial lake brothers arrived, the number of cats in the house was stable at less than fifteen. Nothing else, just because Li Kaixin feels that the number &quot;fifteen&quot; is the current limit of his body and psychology. If there is one more, he will collapse instantly and cry with the aunts in the group while hugging Snowball. That kind of thing. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;After accepting this peaceful little guy at the door, she knew that limits and bottom lines were all meant to be exceeded. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Sister, please apply for a shift shift. Can you arrange a day shift for me in the next week? Please. &quot;The limit has been exceeded, and there is no shame. After calculating that the kittens will sleep during the day and that the aunt can come to help during the day, Li Kaixin sent a message to the head nurse. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;(4) Street Cats&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Li Kaixin’s litter of &quot;artificial lake kittens&quot;, Only three have grown up healthily under artificial care. One of the little guys was unable to be rescued due to dehydration during a collective diarrhea accident. Li Kaixin knew this was inevitable. I had little experience in the first year. I brought a sick cat home during the Spring Festival, and cat plague infected half of the house. Maomao, sweet potato, Xiaorou and her favorite marshmallow did not escape. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;That Spring Festival, when the whole of China was having reunions, Li Kaixin cried for a whole week in the pet hospital because of the kitten’s departure. Among the infected cats, only Winter Melon survived. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The old aunts and colleagues in the rescue group also comforted her not to be sad, saying that the entire litter would not survive without you. But Li Kaixin secretly cried several times. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The last time Li Kaixin cried beyond recognition was because of a cat abuse incident. A man kidnapped a kitten in front of a street cat camera. The cat house was still live-streaming the kidnapping, and two hundred people watched helplessly as he put the kitten playing in a bag. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;When the guardian arrived at the scene, the kitten had already drowned. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Li Kaixin likes this kitten very much and often feeds this cat house. He contacted the guardian privately and sent some better cat food, canned food and deworming medicine, and introduced familiar hospitals. , some sterilization quotas have been reserved for her. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The kitten jumping around and catching butterflies can no longer be seen in the camera of this cat house. But those who kill cats do not get the punishment they deserve. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Li Kaixin and the guardian hugged each other and cried loudly. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;That night, Li Kaixin took a taxi from the suburbs to the scene in the city. The guardian&#39;s thin and small body stood in front of the tall police officers and the suspects to argue, and Li Kaixin joined in. More people came around and argued with them. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;No results were achieved. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;After the crowd dispersed, Li Kaixin and the guardian held the kitten’s body and walked around the community for a long, long time. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Sister, it’s all my fault. I’m not a qualified guardian. I&#39;m so useless. &quot;The guardian shed tears while digging the soil under the tree. The huge teardrops hit the soft soil heavily and seeped into it. I&#39;m not a qualified rescuer, I&#39;m really useless. Li&#39;s happy tears were bigger than those of the guardian. She thought to herself, fuck the fifteen principles, it would have been better if she had come here earlier to take the child away. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The two of them just cried and wet a piece of soil, and then buried the little cold cat in the soil moistened by tears. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Li Kaixin uninstalled Street Cat when he returned home. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;(5) A whim and eternal love&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;After the rise of street cats, there was a The popular cat-loving and cat-saving culture. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Some cat house live broadcasts and rescue sharings have begun to appear on social software. There are many more people looking for Li Kaixin to adopt than in previous years. The &quot;Three Brothers of the Artificial Lake&quot; have already adopted two. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;But at the same time, under the traffic, some cat abuse behaviors began to be exposed and surfaced. Just like the last incident. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;After uninstalling the software, Li Kaixin became more actively involved in various anti-cat abuse publicity conferences. Only in this way would he feel better. Once, several netizens made an appointment to go to the streets together to distribute appeal leaflets, but not long after, Li Kaixin walked to the nearby Xueqiu rescue station in disgrace and in the rain. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;He was kicked out by the urban management, right? &amp;rdquo;Snowball has seen so many strong winds and waves that he is accustomed to them. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Of course, it is not surprising that Li Kaixin and the others were evicted by the urban management, but also people’s sudden sympathy and sudden craze for loving cats. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Just wait and see, the heat will slowly subside, and we will be busy enough in the meantime. &quot;Xueqiu frowned and changed Sanhua&#39;s changing pad. Sanhua went to another room. Fortunately, there was no one in the store at this time. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Xueqiu said that after all, street cats are still a commercial thing. Although it has aroused people&#39;s attention and love for cats to a certain extent, they only feed them without sterilizing them, which still stirs up the rescue circle. The indignation of the old people. Everyone said that this is making TNR (trap, neuter, release) more difficult for them. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The sterilization scalpel here is about to spit out sparks, and there are hundreds of people feeding cats with one click, and there are more and more cats. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Li Kaixin nodded in agreement and said that her community was like this. Although there were already three or four cat houses, the warm-hearted elder sister applied for a cat house for the cleaning lady who was often short of food. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;So the aunt discovered with confusion that although the cat food was much more stable, there were more and more kittens. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Each cat house is equipped with a camera and live broadcast function. At most, Li Kaixin saw two thousand people in a cat house watching a litter of kittens sleeping in the food outlet. Li Kaixin stayed in this cat house for half an hour. The number of people sometimes increased and sometimes decreased. When Li Kaixin left, the number of people had dropped from two thousand to fifteen hundred. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Li Kaixin had a vague premonition. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I wonder if this wave of whims will continue, whether there will be more stray cats and abandoned cats waiting for their rescue. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Li Kaixin returned home in the light rain. Winter Melon came to greet her as usual, and she squatted down and rubbed Winter Melon&#39;s head with the back of her hand as usual. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;She put some promotional papers she had brought back on the porch and walked into the bathroom to wash her hands. The paper was wrinkled after being soaked by the rain, and it read: It is an animal, not a plaything. There are laws to follow when refusing abuse. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;After washing away the dust and bacteria, as well as the traces of urban management pulling on his body, Li Kaixin returned to the living room, picked up the winter melon and held it in his arms. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The artificial lake and Lili also came out to greet her today. Li Kaixin rubbed Lili&#39;s belly again and again, and the water droplets on the tips of his hair dripped one by one on Lili&#39;s mutilated vagina as he lowered his head. The base of the thigh. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The raindrops slowly but quickly penetrated into the hair that was rougher than other parts. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The popularity of cat houses will dissipate, and people who fall in love with cats on a whim will no longer love cats. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;But Li Kaixin’s home will always open the door to kittens, and Li Kaixin will always love kittens. Li Kaixin took Lili and the artificial lake into his arms. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The rain stopped and the sun came out. The orange cat gang was lying around on the balcony in high spirits, enjoying the sunshine. The sun shines in, and colorful cat hair dances in the air with dust. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;It’s okay, I’m here. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Li Kaixin cheered up and cleaned the cat hair on the floor, then picked up the cat shovel and trash can and shoveled poop for fifteen cats. &lt;/p>;&lt;/p>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;Editor-in-charge: Li Jialong&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Please see @ONE Studio’s pinned Weibo for information on the call for papers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Author&lt;/p>; &lt;hr style=&quot;margin-top: 15px;&quot;/>; &lt;table>; &lt;tr>; &lt;td style=&quot;width: 50px;&quot;>; &lt;img src=&quot;http: //image.wufazhuce.com/FkbaxsCHkWtxMgF6YVPncShdb7ED&quot; alt=&quot;Wasteland Orange&quot;>; &lt;/td>; &lt;td>; &lt;div>;Wasteland Orange&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10px&quot;>;&amp;nbsp;Weibo Xiaohongshu@Wasteland Orange&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div style=&quot;&quot;>;I am very indifferent to my confidant, and spend my life in confusion. &lt;/div>; &lt;/td>; &lt;td width=&quot;60px&quot;>; &lt;!-- &lt;span onclick=&quot;OneAPP.openDetail(2, )&quot;>;Follow&lt;/span>; -->; &lt;/td>; &lt;/tr>; &lt;/table>; &lt;p>;Related recommendations&lt;/p>; &lt;hr/>; &lt;table>; &lt;tr>; &lt;td style=&quot;width: 40px;&quot;>; &lt;span>;Reading&lt;/span>; &lt;/td>; &lt;td>; &lt; a href=&quot;/article/6165&quot; data-ajax=&quot;false&quot;>; &lt;div>;A long look back&lt;/div>; &lt;div>;Text/Wool Fox&lt;/div>; &lt;/a>; &lt;/td>; &lt;/tr>; &lt;tr>; &lt;td style=&quot;width: 40px;&quot;>; &lt;span>;Read&lt;/span>; &lt;/td>; &lt;td>; &lt;a href=&quot;/article/6164&quot; data-ajax=&quot;false&quot;>; &lt;div>; The life of express box&lt;/div>; &lt;div>;Text/Endless&lt;/div>; &lt;/a>; &lt;/td>; &lt;/tr>; &lt;/table>; &lt;table>; &lt;tr>; &lt;td>; &lt;div style=&quot;text- align:center;padding:5px;&quot; onclick=&quot;OneAPP.openDetail(2,6167)&quot;>;Click to download ONE app&lt;/div>;&lt;/td>; &lt;/tr>; &lt;/table>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; div>; &lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 20 Nov 2023 06:25:03 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[VOL.4062]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://m.wufazhuce.com/one/4205]]><description>&lt;div>;20 Nov. 2023&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;main&quot;>; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;http://image.wufazhuce.com/FmhWmDZli9fv6_edVB4H1ste35Yl&quot; alt=&quot;Homepage Picture&quot; />; &lt;p >;&lt;span>;VOL.4062&lt;/span>;Photography | Michal Parzuchowski&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;20&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Nov. 2023&lt;/p>; &lt;div>;&lt;/div>; &lt;p>;I decided to start with Admit mistakes, for those mistakes you will eventually make. &lt;/p>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 20 Nov 2023 06:25:03 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
