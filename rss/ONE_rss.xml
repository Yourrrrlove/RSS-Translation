At that time, I was young and had an angry temper. To me, &quot;fighting&quot; meant being myself, and &quot;suffering&quot; meant suppressing myself. . In that situation, the price of &quot;being oneself&quot; is being criticized by teachers, being called parents, and having troubled relationships with classmates and even surrounding classmates. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;When I was in middle school and high school, I was in love. When I met a boy I liked (I am a girl), I took the initiative to pursue him fiercely until the lover finally got married. At that time, the price of &quot;being yourself&quot; was being scolded by your parents when they found out, your grades, which were originally good, became high and low, and being considered by other classmates as not being &quot;reserved&quot; enough and &quot;taking the initiative to chase boys.&quot; &quot;Too low price&quot;. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;When I was in college, I majored in teaching, but after half a year I found that I was really not interested in being a teacher. I still wanted to do something interesting, such as literature and art. So I frequently skipped classes and used the time I saved to write novels in the library, work part-time in the theater, shoot videos in the dormitory, and take photos of my senior classmates. At that time, the price of &quot;being yourself&quot; was being warned by the counselor in private messages many times and being considered as not doing your job properly by your parents. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;After graduation, I did not follow the Shandong tradition of taking the public examination. Instead, I went to Beipiao alone to work in the cultural media industry that I was interested in. The price of &quot;being yourself&quot; at this time is &quot;the huge pressure brought by fast-paced work, a relatively turbulent life state, the occasional loneliness in a foreign land, and the judgment of relatives and friends when returning home for vacation.&quot; &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;But in all the above moments when I chose to &quot;be myself&quot;, I didn&#39;t feel that the price was high or high. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Because people have a weight in their hearts. When you think that the benefits of &quot;being yourself&quot; are greater than the costs, you will choose to &quot;be yourself&quot; and vice versa. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;For me at that time, the psychological damage caused by teachers’ criticism, parents’ blame, and classmates’ prejudice was far less than the pleasure and pleasure brought by venting my anger and releasing my youthful passion. High satisfaction. Similarly, I can endure the loneliness, work pressure and turbulent life in Beidiao,&lt;strong>;because the great joy and freedom of doing what I love can completely outweigh them. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Have I ever had a moment when I wasn’t “being myself”? Of course there are many. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;For example, in the early days of work, when I was dumped, I did not resist, but chose to swallow it; for example, I participated in some unwilling social gatherings in order to maintain interpersonal relationships; and for example, in the early days of self-media, in order to win Traffic always chooses some &quot;hot topics&quot;, even if these topics actually don&#39;t interest me at all. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Why did I choose &quot;not to be myself&quot; in these things? It&#39;s simple because the cost of &quot;being myself&quot; in these things exceeds the benefits. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;But if I think about it more deeply, &lt;strong>;In fact, many times when I choose to &quot;not be myself&quot;, in the final analysis, it is to &quot;be myself&quot;&lt;/strong>;&amp;mdash; The purpose of socializing is to quickly integrate into the current work circle, so as to make it easier to make achievements in the industry later. The same goes for doing self-media hot spots. If you don’t use hot spots, it will be difficult to get started. If you don’t even get started, how can you talk about subsequent development? &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;As I grow older, I increasingly believe that the so-called &quot;cost&quot; of &quot;being yourself&quot; comes mostly from the evaluation of society and others.&lt;strong>;And when you learn to look down upon these external evaluations, it is so big. In most cases, the cost of &quot;being yourself&quot; will be reduced to very low, and you will be more able to calmly follow your heart&#39;s wishes. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Of course, as I become more and more &quot;thick-skinned&quot;, I will also reflect on: Is it necessarily good to just be myself? &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Because &quot;being yourself&quot; sometimes not only incurs costs for yourself, but also costs for others - hurting other people&#39;s feelings and damaging other people&#39;s interests. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;While &quot;being yourself&quot;, act according to circumstances, and learn to leave a way out, a step up, and some compassion for yourself and others. This is what I have learned recently. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Of course, the premise of everything is that you must first find your true self, know who you are and what you want. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;/p>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;Editor in charge: Zhou Ziheng onewenti@wufazhuce.com&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Please see @ONE Studio’s pinned Weibo for information on the call for papers.

But no matter where you and I are, if we look up at the stars in the sky, we can always recognize the one star we have in common. &lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;One October a few years ago, I drove from Beijing to attend the wedding of a friend I didn’t know well. After drinking a few more glasses of wine, the unripeness will be ripened. A group of people were noisy and quarrelsome, as if they were going to spoil all the fun in this life today. As they drank and drank, the sense of emptiness in life was even more heightened. Until the next day, the bustling sound in my ears did not dissipate. I walked out of the hotel and looked at the firecrackers that had not been cleaned in front of the door, flying in the autumn wind. A sense of desolation suddenly came over me, and the last trace of drunkenness disappeared. Then they dispersed, and my friends returned to an unfamiliar place in my heart. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I sent him a message saying that I would withdraw first. After driving back for almost half an hour, the speedometer slowed down and a large number of cars appeared in front of us, congesting the road like a beet field waiting to be harvested. The National Day holiday is coming to an end, and people are swarming back to their lives, fearing that they will be locked out if they wait a little longer. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I lit a cigarette and waited impatiently. It took three to five minutes for the car to move forward a short distance. My stomach was the first to lose patience, churning with pain. I took out two stomach medicines and swallowed them, which gave me some relief, but the next moment, hunger surged back. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I had nothing to do. The car was empty and I had no habit of stocking food. I could only look forward helplessly. The back of the car and the back of the car were filled with the frustration of not being able to face the situation head-on. Looking at the navigation again, there were only three hours left before, but now it has become five hours. The long red line ahead is a patient encounter. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The car moved forward a little further, and I saw the sign on the roadside. Go straight towards Beijing, turn right and get off the highway, and you will see a small county town. I took another look and felt that the name of the small county was a bit familiar. After thinking about it for a while, it seemed that a friend lived here. Without much hesitation, I pulled into the right lane, then waited in line for a short while, splitting the traffic, and drove all the way out of the highway. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;When we got on the national highway, a rice field fell on both sides of us. My car was like a zipper, dividing this golden piece into two pieces, opening and closing all the way forward. Because of the emptiness, my anxiety and hunger were relieved a little, and then I started thinking about my friend again. He was so far away, so far away that I almost forgot his appearance. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The days ten years ago were like a weak candlelight. I had just started working as an engineering intern in a construction company. The company assigned me to Gansu In a project on the border with Ningxia, it was originally a barren mountain. Coal resources had just been discovered. Energy companies moved in, construction companies poured in, and rows of engineering transport trucks filled the yellow gravel road with smoke and dust. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The company built a row of temporary houses on the side of the mountain. As an office worker, I was assigned a single room, which was so small that it could only accommodate a bed and a table. A forklift or a road roller drives by and the whole house trembles. Many late nights, I was woken up by the trembling. Even after I made sure it was not an earthquake, it was difficult to fall asleep again. So I lay down at the window and looked at the well house under construction late at night, the clear and crisp starry sky in the wilderness, and the machine being mixed. Roaring and disturbing the Loess Plateau, Luoyang shovels are digging into the hinterland; a poor family&#39;s dog is gnawing on the grass. It is tied to the well water pump, guarding our drinking water source. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;It was difficult for me to adapt to this almost wild living environment, and my new colleagues couldn&#39;t find a way to blend in, so my life was somewhat depressed. So he spent most of his time alone, often wandering on the path with the hillside on one side and the cliff on the other after dinner while the twilight was still lingering. In this way, in the eyes of others, I became an eccentric person who liked to be alone and was not approachable, and I was too lazy to cater to and explain. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;One part of my job is to collect the certificates of construction materials. When I was making the form that day, I couldn’t find the model and certificate of the wire, so I asked the project manager, who asked me to Go to an electrician and ask for it. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I went to the workers’ dormitory. When I got to the door, I saw a young man smoking. He said that everyone inside was sleeping. I then remembered that it was my lunch break and turned around to leave, but he asked me again, &quot;What are you doing here?&quot; I told my request and he said, oh, I am an electrician, but I didn’t keep the certificate before, so I threw it all away. I said you can keep it for me in the future, and he said no problem. Then he threw down the cigarette butt, turned around and went back to the dormitory to sleep. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;A few days later, I was sitting in the house reading a book. Someone knocked on the door. When I opened the door, I saw the electrician. He said that it took him a long time to find your house. Why is your house so small? Like a doghouse? I said it&#39;s at least a single room, which is better than your Datong store. He took out a stack of certificates from his pocket, and because there were various tools hanging on his waist, his body was shaking, and he asked, &quot;Are these enough for you?&quot; I took it and said enough is enough, thank you. What&#39;s he saying to be polite? If it&#39;s not enough, then talk to me again. Then he turned around and walked away, still making a lot of noise along the way. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;From here on, we got to know each other, and we would say hello when we met on the construction site. I troubled him a few times because of certificates and wire inspections, etc. I have always been careful about causing trouble, but he carelessly treated it as a trivial matter, which made me seem a bit pretentious. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Later one night when we were laying concrete, I had to wait to make the test block, and he was waiting to put in the embedded pipe, but there was something wrong with the concrete tank, which was being repaired, so we could only wait with our arms folded. . It was already autumn, the grass seeds were forming, and the cool wind under the moon made people shiver. The two of us hid in the water tanker, found two of the driver&#39;s military coats and put them on, and we kept talking. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;He likes to talk about his hometown, a village in the mountains of Hebei. Every spring, the team of migrant workers marches out. The men have agreed on the itinerary the previous winter. Sometimes they know where to go. Sometimes no matter where you go. After leaving like this, the village is almost empty of men. They have to wait through the four seasons before they come back in winter with money or disappointment and fill the village again. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;His Mandarin is not very standard, with a bit of Hebei accent. Sometimes he says a few more words, and I have to ask him again before I can understand him clearly. The more I heard, the more clearly I saw this person. When I was a teenager, I followed my cousin to work. I didn’t want to just be a laborer, who would put in the most effort but earn the least, so I learned to be an electrician from a master. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Over the past few years, I have been to several major cities including Beijing, Qingdao and Zhengzhou, but it still feels like I have never been there before. Once I entered the construction site, I saw a village in the city, different from the glamorous buildings and cities outside. Amorous feelings have nothing to do with it. Once you&#39;ve built a wilderness into a decent state, it&#39;s time to leave. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;After walking through several cities, several prosperous cities rose up behind him, and all his abilities were internalized. The world pushed him to leave his master and start his own journey. A building was excavated from the foundation, with nine twists and turns, all the bright and dark passages laid out in his mind. When the switch was pushed, all the lights came on, and his work was done. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;When the project was accepted, he stood in front of the building, watching the bright lights, and felt an indescribable sense of accomplishment. The lights of thousands of houses often mentioned in the story turned out to be pierced by people like him. If there was any slight difference, the light of any house would be dimmed. He seems to hold the lifeline of other people&#39;s happiness. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The mixer was repaired in the early morning that night. We both yawned and got out of the car and went about our business. I put the concrete into the mold for the test block and kept poking it with a steel bar. It can become denser by shaking and shaking. This mechanical movement was boring, so I looked up at the sky. The moon was too bright and I couldn&#39;t see the stars, but I thought in my heart that I had made such a friend. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;From then on, we would often get together to chat. He talked a lot and I listened a lot. Compared with his various experiences, the human world I experienced was a little bit dull. Boring. Most of the life on the construction site is boring. The ancient farming routine is always followed, and the long nights need to be passed away while watching the sun work. In the workers&#39; dormitory, dozens of men were divided into five or six groups. Those who played cards shouted, and those who drank were even louder. The group of people formed a small circle, full of smoke and gurgling. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;He doesn’t like playing cards or drinking. He doesn’t belong in that noisy little society, so he often comes to my room to sit around. I said you don’t think my dog ​​house is too small this time. Already? He smiled and said that no matter how small a dog house is, it is still a nest, and it is much better than our Datong shop. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;There are some books in my room that I bought when I occasionally went to the county town. He would pick one and read it. But I always lose patience after reading a few pages. I think my book is not easy to read, and the story is not as exciting as it is. I was too lazy to argue with him, so I turned on my computer and started writing. I started trying to write some words, but they were all unformed and unruly. They were all fragmentary feelings that I wrote wherever I thought. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;He grabbed my computer and wanted to read it, but I didn’t give it to him. Why can&#39;t he wipe his face? I said I couldn&#39;t take it. He chuckled, folded his hands behind his head, and lay on my bed, saying that people like you are called showy people in our area. Kung Fu is not on the surface, it is all hidden in the mind and heart. I said what about you? Does it count? He said that I didn’t count. If I didn’t go up or down, I would be stuck in the middle, so I wouldn’t feel comfortable no matter how I stayed. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The two of us often chatted until late at night. From my window, I could see that the lights in the workers’ dormitory were all out, and he would go back, whistling all the way, and turning the little boy who looked at the well into the water. The dog barked in amusement. At night in the wilderness, the barking of dogs made it seem even more lonely. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;My car drove through the rice fields and entered the hinterland of the hills. The mountains in autumn revealed some vigorous and majestic shapes, and the road began to wind. Going around in circles. I took out my mobile phone to send a message to a friend. I added WeChat a few years ago, and I didn’t even say more than three or five sentences. I asked him where are you? After asking, I realized that he might not be at home. At this time, it was not the time for migrant workers to return to their hometowns. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;After a while, he replied to me and said he was at home. I thought I was lucky, so I said I was almost arriving in your county. He called directly, and his voice was quite excited. Is it true? Why did I lie to you? He said where are you? I will look for you! I said okay, I&#39;ll send you the location. After hanging up the phone, I parked the car, found a restaurant and sent it over, asking us to have a meal together. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The small county town is not big, and when I turned east and west I saw the end. I went to the hotel first, found a small box, sat in it and ordered the food, and then used a rusty kettle to scald the cup. , drinking water and waiting for him. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The phone rang a few times and he said he had arrived. I went to pick him up at the door and saw him pushing a motorcycle from a distance, wearing sunglasses. I waved to him, and he rushed over to shake my hand. His palms were thick and rough, and with just a touch, you could touch the background of life. He looked me up and down and said you haven&#39;t changed much. I said you don&#39;t seem to have changed, he smiled and said you are old. Then he took off his sunglasses, and the big eyes in his memory were now squinted, as if he couldn&#39;t open them. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I took him into the box, and the two of us sat across from each other, separated by a wooden table and almost ten years of time. I asked if your home is far from here? He said it would take half an hour to ride. But as if he was afraid that I would go to his house to visit, he added that the environment at my house is not good, so I would ask you to have a meal at home. I can only say that this trip is quite urgent. I will stop by your house next time. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The dishes came one after another. I was hungry and used my chopsticks. I asked him to eat quickly, but he looked at the dishes very cautiously and said, why are we ordering so much? I didn’t know if he was being overly preoccupied. I thought he was afraid that he would have to pay more when he wanted to pay the bill, so I quickly said that we haven’t seen each other for so many years. If I want to treat you to a meal, I will order two more dishes. He smiled. I said, how about we have a drink? He said it’s okay for me to ride a motorcycle. They are all on country roads. Can you drive? I said it&#39;s okay, I&#39;m not leaving tonight. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;He was so drunk that his face turned red after drinking a little. He pointed at his eyes and said that they were caused by dry welding. The light was so dazzling that he could not open his eyes over time. I said, aren&#39;t you an electrician? Why did you switch to electric welding? He said he would do both in order to make more money. He raised his feet and showed me his cloth shoes. The uppers were almost worn out. He said my wife made it for me and I have been wearing it for three years. I said you should earn a lot from doing two types of work, right? He said it was okay, but he had to raise children. The eldest son was in elementary school and the second son was about to go to kindergarten. He had to save money for the children. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I nodded, said I understood, and asked him why he didn’t go out to work this year? He said that he was unlucky last year when he was building a house in Inner Mongolia. A man at the construction site drank too much and stole a cable and was electrocuted to death. It was all because of him, an electrician, and the boss was unreasonable. In the end, half a year&#39;s salary was deducted, plus the round trip expenses, food and drink. Yes, a year of hard work in vain. This year there happened to be something going on near my home, so I didn’t go out. I talked about his difficulties and poured him wine. He asked me about my life. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;When I was in the northwest, I wrote random things, and I won the prize when I submitted them. I published a few articles immediately, and then I got lucky one after another. I signed a contract with a book company and published books, which sold well. , he quit his job and moved to Beijing to specialize in writing. Later, the publishing industry became more and more sluggish, so he entered the film and television industry and became a screenwriter. He released several works and was considered a minor success. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;These experiences sound logical and smooth, but only you can taste the hardships and hardships involved. But facing my old friend, with his eyes damaged by the welding light, rough palms and cloth shoes that have been worn for three years, all these hardships of mine are not worth mentioning or should be understood. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;So I just said that I was lucky and God didn’t make things difficult for me. His eyes narrowed again, and he smiled, saying that I have already told you that you have a good talent, and you are really good at it. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;We both drank a little too much that day. When I went to check out and came back, I saw him packing vegetables. In fact, there weren’t any vegetables left. There was only a pair of uneaten chicken wings, which he put into a plastic bag. , looked at me a little shyly, and said to take it back to the children, because children love to eat this stuff. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I originally wanted to ask for another portion, but I didn’t say it out loud. I was afraid of hurting him or embarrassing him, so I catered to him and said, yes, it’s a waste if I lose it. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;We left the hotel and the night fell. He was shaky and wanted to ride a motorcycle. When I saw that this was not possible and something would happen on the road, I stopped him and dragged him to a nearby hotel. , opened a standard room, and drank tea with him. When I went to the bathroom, when I came back, he had fallen asleep on the bed. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I was still drunk, so I went downstairs for a walk. The lights in the small county town were brightly lit, but there were few pedestrians on the road. I walked aimlessly, thinking that if I turned right, turned right, and then turned right again, I would definitely be there. Can be transferred back. But the roads in this world are never regular or smooth. After driving around for a few times, I lost my way. I used my mobile phone to navigate before walking back. I was already sober from the wine. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I stood in front of the hotel and smoked a cigarette. The autumn wind took away most of it. I saw something fluttering in the basket of his motorcycle. When I got closer, I saw clearly that it was the plastic bag with chicken wings. , a hole was blown open by the wind, and the chicken wings were lying inside, shriveled and colorless, and it smelled of desolation at a glance. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I took out the chicken wings and threw them away, and then went to a nearby supermarket to buy some snacks that children loved, stuffed them into the basket of the car, then returned to the room and fell on the other bed, still feeling drunk. Come, I took a look at the curtains that were not tightened. There were still no stars in the night, no different from the nights on the northwest plateau many years ago. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The cold wind strikes in an instant, and a thin layer of snow particles fell at night. In addition to being barren, the winter on the Loess Plateau finally added Some bleak smell. As soon as winter comes, the entire construction site faces a shutdown. The foreman and the workers are doing winter concrete maintenance, piling piles of foam particles on the concrete foundation. The foam is light and flies with the wind. Soon, Just melt together with the snow particles. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I still have a lot of data to process, so I have a holiday later than the workers. As an electrician, he can leave earlier than the laborers. So the separation came quickly and slowly. In fact, we have only known each other for a few months, so it is impossible to say how much friendship there is. It is just that the emotions in youth are easily amplified and the thoughts are relatively pure, which makes this friendship a bit thicker. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;He received a year&#39;s salary, and the night before he left, he invited me to dinner. There was a small town more than ten kilometers away from the construction site, where there were several small restaurants. He borrowed a motorcycle and took me there. I went to the town with a bumpy ride. After choosing and choosing, he finally entered a barbecue restaurant. He said it was warm. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;When the low stove was brought up, the charcoal fire turned red, and the snow particles outside started to float again. The wind leaked from the windows of the small hotel, and it poured into the house. We had nowhere to hide. . &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The meat was sizzling and cooked, and we ate it slowly with two bottles of beer. He also talked about the situation in his hometown. Half of his parents’ old house had collapsed, and he wanted to build it when he went back. Just build a bigger house so that you can get your wife back. He couldn&#39;t put off this matter any longer, otherwise it would be too late. Building a house would cost a lot of money, and he didn&#39;t have enough money, so he thought about putting up the frame first and then slowly working on the inside. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Having been an electrician for several years, his life should be better than before, but it still has a background of hardship. He has brightened up so many houses, but he doesn’t know when this one in his own house will be able to be restored. lights up. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;But he is not too worried, and still holds many wonderful fantasies about life. I was the same at that time. I was very dissatisfied with my current job, but I didn’t know how to break through, and I didn’t know how to break through. I am too anxious, and I always have an inexplicable belief in my heart that the future will be good. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Maybe young people are like this, always having deep expectations and superficial anxieties about the future. Then as time went by, the two swapped places. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;At the end of the meal that day, he said that he might not come to work here next year. As soon as he said this, the food he chewed had the taste of farewell. Although communication is convenient, the world is vast and people They are all busy with their own lives and deaths, and there is nothing specific to do, so they will not deliberately go to meet each other. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;But the fire was going on that night, and it was not suitable for saying such unkind words, so I said with a guilty conscience that I would visit each other when I had time in the future, and then also said something like having a good time and relying on you in the future. They all appear to be overly considerate but are actually extremely polite. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;We both drank a little too much that day. When I paid the bill secretly, he complained to me a few words and kept mumbling, look what happened, look what happened. , then you must go to me in the future and I will treat you to dinner. I promised, but I felt that a small thing like a meal was nothing to worry about. The more I talked about it, the more stingy it seemed. Maybe it’s not stingy, it’s just that the weight in everyone’s heart is different. Having experienced the difficulties in life, he knows the value of money. But when I first entered this society, all I saw was that there was a vast future ahead, and I had not yet made any plans. On the other hand, the handling of money is more casual. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The next day, I woke up from ten years of drunkenness. The other bed in the room was empty, and my friends had already left. I turned on my phone and saw the message he left me, saying that he had gone to work at the construction site and would come back to me after get off work. I looked through other messages and saw that there was an urgent matter at work that I needed to go back to deal with, so I replied to him and said that I had to go back because of something and I would see him again when I had time. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I drove away and passed through the golden rice fields again and got on the highway. This time there was no traffic jam. Above my head was a deep blue of autumn, which is rare on our destiny. It was sunny, I pressed down the car window, the wind blew on my face, and I felt a slight pain. I thought at that time, in fact, we are not far apart, so I should come and see him more when I have time. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Then the days passed lightly, and in a blink of an eye, several years passed. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;In the past few years, our contact has become much more frequent than before. Although we don’t chat often, we still exchange a few words every few months. When I was sorting out my belongings or moving things around, I would take photos of the things I planned to throw away but felt regretful about, asking him if he wanted them, and then mail them to him. He said the backpack could be used as a schoolbag for his son. He said he could wear the shoes, but if they were one size larger, they would be just right. He said that the mats were bundled in a bundle and brought to the construction site for a nap, and he said that some of the clothes could be worn while working. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Later, I became a habit of mailing things. Maybe he felt embarrassed, so he asked me not to mail them, saying that some of the things I mailed were new. I couldn&#39;t say that those things were impulse purchases, and I didn&#39;t want to use these words after I bought them, for fear that he would be uncomfortable hearing them. I was also afraid that he would think I was lying and hurt his self-esteem with my kindness. So I obeyed him honestly and stopped sending him anything in the mail. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;One day later, he suddenly called me and asked me if I could lend him 50,000 yuan. He said that he wanted to buy a house in the county and wanted to transfer his children to study in the county. , the down payment is still a little short of. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I have spent money lavishly over the years. Although I have some savings, I have been running out of money. During that time, my girlfriend and I were planning to buy a house and get married. We were short of money in the face of major life events. But I still agreed to lend him the money, but after I agreed, I explained my situation and told you to pay me back when you have the money. He said yes for sure. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;After hanging up the phone, I went about my own business. It took me a few days to remember that he never sent me his bank account number. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I sent him a message to ask, and he said that the owner of the house suddenly stopped selling it, so he was not in a hurry to use the money and would talk to me later when he needed it. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I stared at the words, and it was difficult to distinguish for a moment. I didn’t know whether the landlord really suddenly stopped selling, or whether it was because of his state of mind. My last instructions made him feel uncomfortable. I really wanted to call and find out what happened, but in the end I didn&#39;t know what was delaying it. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;As time went by, I moved out of Beijing and settled down in a southern city. I continued to write and write scripts, and when I published a book, I would still mail him a copy. We rarely chat anymore, and only greet each other during holidays. He doesn’t post much on Moments, and I don’t know much about his situation. If there’s no bad news, it’s all good news. Maybe most people’s lives are like this. There are no big ups and downs, just going round and round in the circle that I have agreed with the world. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Last fall, I went to the provincial capital city of his hometown for some matters. When I got there, I sent him a message saying that I am here and you are at home. , I will go find you tomorrow. He didn&#39;t reply to me at that time, so I went about my own business. After dinner that night, on the recommendation of others, we went to see the live performance of the Kangxi Ceremony. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The performance is very shocking. The real scenery surrounded by mountains and rivers is blended with the later scenery. When real horses run by, you can even smell the smell of horse manure in the dust raised. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Kangxi’s life was magnificent, and the occasional tenderness was integrated into the overwhelming pride. In the prime of his life, he asked the teacher who taught him how to read the sky. You said that after death, people will turn into stars in the sky. Which one is Qin Shihuang? Which one is Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty? Which one is the ancestor of the Tang Dynasty and Song Dynasty? And which one is my favorite girl? &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The astrologer could not answer, and the stars in the sky also fell silent. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;At the end of the performance, Kangxi turned around and left in the gradually closing mountain scenery, walked away, and turned into a dragon hovering on the boulder. He did not become a star. No one can get eternity, no matter how great he is. In a new song and dance, the audience stood up and left. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I sat at the end before leaving. Before I left, the phone rang. It was a call from a friend. He said he left his phone in the dormitory. I asked him where he was? He said that he was not at home, but in Gansu, but it was not the construction site back then, but a new coal mine hundreds of miles away. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I asked if there were any changes there? He said there seemed to be no changes, the construction sites were all the same. He suddenly sighed and said that we met in Gansu more than ten years ago, and I am still in Gansu more than ten years later. Sometimes I can&#39;t sleep at night, and I close my eyes and play the slide show in my mind. It seems like a lot has happened scene by scene in the past ten years. But if you think about it carefully, it seems like nothing happened. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I heard mixed feelings and didn’t know what to say for a while. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;He changed the subject and asked me what I was doing here this time. I briefly explained it, but he said, &quot;Oh, I don&#39;t understand it either.&quot; I mentioned that I had just watched the Kangxi Dadian performance and asked him if he had seen it before? He said that he had worked here when the performance venue was being built, but had never seen it once. I said you can come and take a look when you come back later, it’s quite nice. He was silent for a while and said that I might not be able to see anymore. I have been doing welding for many years and my eye is damaged. There is something growing inside. I need an operation. If it is not done well, I will not be able to see anything in the future. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I felt bad and told you not to say this. Nowadays, medical technology is so good that almost all diseases can be cured. Cancer has become a chronic disease in China. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;He was silent for a moment and said that you should go out for more walks in the future and see more of what you should see, just as if you were watching for me. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I suddenly didn’t know what to say. I remembered that night in Gansu many years ago, when we left the barbecue restaurant. On the return trip of more than ten kilometers, he still drove me on his motorcycle. The mountain road was gentle, and I He didn&#39;t feel scared because he drank too much. Maybe he drank too much, so he could only feel the mighty mountain wind, and the sky hung with stars from hundreds of millions of years ago, looking at thousands of human beings. all over. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Then the car passed many intersections, and our lives were divided into two sides. From then on, each had its own landscapes and embarrassments. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I came to my senses and said, are you outside now? If you look up, can you see Cassiopeia? Just a few stars that look like W. After a while, he said he saw it, and seemed to see it. I said I saw it too, look, what we can see is actually the same. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;He said calmly? So that’s how it is, that’s great. &lt;/p>;&lt;/p>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;Editor-in-charge: Li Jialong&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Please see @ONE Studio’s pinned Weibo for information on the call for papers.
