In this day and age, this may sound unbelievable, but for people in the late 1980s or early 1990s, this was actually nothing unusual. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I remember that the first time I saw a computer, it was in my father’s workplace. The computer was square and heavy, and the system it ran was called Windows97. This computer cannot be connected to the Internet and can only play small games. The games it comes with are Spider Poker and Minesweeper. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Nowadays, with material prosperity, it is difficult for young people to imagine the world of material scarcity in the past. My mother told me that when I was born, food stamps were issued. Corresponding to material scarcity is the monotony of entertainment and information. In the era before the Internet, there were only a few TV channels. Every Tuesday, the TV stations were off the air, making it impossible to watch. It can be imagined that the things we had access to at that time were limited. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Actually, if I think about it carefully, I had very few requirements for the Internet at the beginning. It is already very good to be able to surf the Internet, contact friends far away, and browse some world news on the web. &lt;strong>;This is just like people living. In fact, they only need sunlight, water, clean air, and clothes. Our original needs are not many, but the development of commercial society and the Internet have amplified our desires. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Initially, what I needed for the Internet world was &quot;relaxation&quot;, but now, what I see is &quot;peer pressure&quot; and &quot;others are living better than others.&quot; &quot;I&#39;m good&quot; is &quot;anxiety everywhere&quot;. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The commercial society and big data have conspired to kidnap our original happiness. Think about it, at the beginning, surfing the Internet was called &quot;surfing the Internet&quot;. What was it like to surf the Internet? It’s just free and refreshing. But how do you feel about being online now? Do you often feel like the screen is full of anger? &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Technological products are tools, how to use them is still a human problem. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;What I need does not match what I see, so the Internet often feels large and confusing, mainly for two reasons: &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p >;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;1. Information overload&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Imagine that our brain is also a processor. If too much data is run, of course it will be burned. With the addition of various apps and social media, there is an unprecedented proliferation of information. We take out our mobile phones to surf the Internet, often just to get a moment of rest, but we find that the Internet is full of all kinds of celebrity gossip, product displays, other people&#39;s life displays, chicken soup articles, etc.&lt;strong>;We are unknowingly addicted, like a ship A boat that strays into a swamp will get stuck in the mud at some point. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;There will always be all kinds of things that make you unhappy and make you feel anxious and painful. This is completely contrary to the &quot;relaxation and stress reduction&quot; we need in the first place. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;2. There are simply not that many things we need online&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;People in the past faced There is a single real world, but modern people face the superposition of reality and virtuality, the two worlds. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Sometimes when entering a shopping website, all we want is a pair of shoes, but after looking at it, you will want a new dress. After looking at it for a long time, you may also want new clothes. Pants or other jewelry. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The operating mechanism of commercial society is to create needs that you don’t need at all, and to infinitely amplify your desires. What businesses have to do is drain your wallet of money. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;If you want to improve the negative impact of the Internet and prevent yourself from becoming a person with unsatisfied desires, there are actually some ways. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;1. Reduce the time spent online and return to offline life and paper reading&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;A few days ago I went to a I was climbing a mountain in the park. When I climbed to the top, I sat on a stool to rest. At that moment, I didn’t look at my phone or care about anything happening on the Internet. I just quietly looked at the blue sky and the yellow autumn sun. The yellow ginkgo leaves give me a long-lost sense of relaxation and joy. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;In the process of contacting nature, I felt a sense of healing. I no longer cared about whether others made more money and lived better, but focused on the present and quietly felt the beauty of nature. For a moment, free air, free beauty. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Faced with information overload on the Internet, the best way is to prevent that information from entering your brain, so appropriately disconnecting from the Internet is actually beneficial to physical and mental health. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;2. Use the Internet with a certain purpose, rather than just browsing blindly&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>; In order to avoid being disturbed by the Internet, Internet writers often set up small black rooms for themselves. The so-called &quot;black room&quot; is a code word system. You cannot exit until you finish writing the few thousand words you set. During this period, all functions of your computer disappear and you can only write. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I have been preparing for exams and reviewing for a while, so I followed a lot of learning UP masters at Station B. Because what I need is very clear, so every time I stay at Station B, I listen to lectures, study, and take notes. . At this time, I feel that the benefit of the developed Internet is that it makes it easier to spread knowledge. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Using the Internet with a certain purpose and quitting when you are done will actually make it easier for you. You may feel like you are so tired. Why did surfing the Internet turn into &quot;going to class&quot;? In fact, if you try and turn the Internet into a simpler matter of reading, studying or working, it will not feel so messy. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;You will no longer care about what others do, but just focus on what you are doing at the moment. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Overall, I think technological progress is a good thing. &lt;strong>;The Internet has brought us a bigger world, but the problem also comes from this. People are prone to Feeling overwhelmed in a chaotic world. &lt;/strong>;So, it is good to take a break occasionally. We need to calm down and think carefully, what is our more essential desire? &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I have closed the circle of friends for a while. When I opened it again, I found that I had not missed anything. At the same time, I also deleted many shopping or social apps. There is a sense of relief after minimalizing information, and my relationship with the Internet seems to be more peaceful. &lt;strong>;It turns out that people really need very few things to live. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;/p>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;Editor in charge: Zhou Ziheng onewenti@wufazhuce.com&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Please see @ONE Studio’s pinned Weibo for information on the call for papers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Respondent&lt;/p>; &lt;hr/>; &lt;table>; &lt;tr>; &lt;td style=&quot;width: 50px;&quot;>; &lt;img src=&quot;http://image.wufazhuce.com/FmIxumvucSMThvBqzjla4dEmFbwL &quot; alt=&quot;Rabbit Grass&quot;>; &lt;/td>; &lt;td>; &lt;div>;Rabbit Grass&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10px&quot;>;&amp;nbsp;@Rabbit Grass Tucao&lt;/span>; &lt;/div>; &lt;div style =&quot;&quot;>;Retired copywriter, juggling writer. &lt;/div>; &lt;/td>; &lt;td width=&quot;60px&quot;>; &lt;!-- &lt;span onclick=&quot;OneAPP.openDetail(4, )&quot;>;Follow&lt;/span>; -->; &lt;/td>; &lt;/tr>; &lt;/table>; &lt;p>;Related recommendations&lt;/p>; &lt;hr/>; &lt;table>; &lt;tr>; &lt;td style=&quot;width: 40px;&quot;>; &lt;span>;Question and Answer&lt;/span>; &lt;/td>; &lt;td>; &lt; a href=&quot;/question/3975&quot; data-ajax=&quot;false&quot;>; &lt;div>;The Year of Walking: How did &quot;relaxation&quot; become a luxury product? &lt;/div>; &lt;div style=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/div>; &lt;/a>; &lt;/td>; &lt;/tr>; &lt;tr>; &lt;td style=&quot;width: 40px;&quot;>; &lt;span>;Q&amp;A&lt;/span>; &lt; /td>; &lt;td>; &lt;a href=&quot;/question/3990&quot; data-ajax=&quot;false&quot;>; &lt;div>;What do you do when you are alone? &lt;/div>; &lt;div style=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/div>; &lt;/a>; &lt;/td>; &lt;/tr>; &lt;/table>; &lt;table>; &lt;tr>; &lt;td>;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align:center ;padding:5px;&quot; onclick=&quot;OneAPP.openDetail(4,3988)&quot;>;Click to download ONE app&lt;/div>;&lt;/td>; &lt;/tr>; &lt;/table>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p>; &lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https:/ /feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.run&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.run&lt;/a>;&lt;br >;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 27 Nov 2023 06:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[后来]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://m.wufazhuce.com/article/6175]]><description> &lt;div>;27 Nov. 2023&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;main&quot;>; &lt;div>; &lt;p>;Text/Chen Gong&lt;/p>; &lt;div>; &lt;p>;&lt;div contenteditable=&quot;false&quot;>;&lt;img data-author=&quot;&quot; data-original-src=&quot;http://image.wufazhuce.com/Fm3ONMA9NZYvf7hiua94hEDUuytb&quot; data-source=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://image.wufazhuce.com/Fm3ONMA9NZYvf7hiua94hEDUuytb&quot;>;&lt;/div >;&lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;div>;&lt;div style=&quot;font-size:26px;line-height: 1;&quot;>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Many people have such a companion: extremely close But it is difficult for them to intersect in their fates, as if they are living in parallel chains of fate, and occasionally they can intersect briefly through the ripples of time. Perhaps this can be considered a benefit that can never be obtained or lost. &lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>;&lt;h1 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Up&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h1>;&lt;p>;In 2005, transferred Xiao Guangyuan met She Yingxin for the first time. At that time, my dad&#39;s leg had just been crushed by a steel bar. He was doing waste recycling work in the urban area that everyone looked down upon. He still paid a high price to enter the school, which was euphemistically called the school choice fee. On the first day of school, during the class meeting, the head teacher called me outside the classroom and asked me for an invoice. He deliberately said in a loud voice to the whole class that your foundation is not good and you came in through the back door. Don&#39;t be too arrogant at ordinary times. Ask local classmates for advice. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I actually had quite low self-esteem when I transferred to another school. In junior high school, everyone was already very sensitive, and my family background was not very good, so I couldn’t keep up with my studies. My accent, hobbies, living habits, and even IQ were all the same. The local children are all different. One thing I remember particularly deeply is that I was anxious to inform my dad about something, and asked a classmate to borrow his waveguide phone. After opening the cover, I couldn&#39;t even find the power button, so I could only hold the phone to my ears and face it. I talked in the air, stumbling and stumbling for a long time while acting. When I returned the phone, he suppressed a smile and told me that he didn’t even have a phone card installed. The whole class burst into laughter. I don’t know if you have ever felt like being laughed at by everyone. How should I describe that feeling? It’s not so much shame as it is numbness, so much so that I can’t help but laugh along with others, just like Accepting from the bottom of his heart that he is an alien, this is cruel to an adolescent child, but it is as cruel as a fairy tale. Because the child&#39;s innocence weakly downplayed some of the damage. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;She Yingxin’s existence is like a torch, a beam of light lit behind me in a strange environment. She Yingxin was my third roommate after I transferred to another school. By the way, the first two were also girls. The reason why they were roommates for a short time was because they thought I had a bad taste in me. But I have been sitting with She Yingxin for a long time, from the second semester of the second grade of junior high school to graduation. The reason is also very dramatic: because she has had rhinitis since she was born. She said that she can&#39;t smell anything during the day, but at night she can&#39;t smell anything. Fortunately, I can still smell it a little bit when I poop. Also because of such a perverted biological law, I have always been afraid of the late self-study teacher dragging me down. To put this matter in a childish way, it is like Inuyasha is afraid of seeing the full moon, after all, his weakness will be exposed in an instant. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;People and people often start from some random opportunities. In the summer vacation of the second grade of junior high school, the city was engaged in the construction of health projects, and our school did a renovation work. After the school started, the renovation of the teaching building was not completed. We moved more than 700 people from the whole grade to an abandoned factory building in the suburbs. The twelve rooms were separated by wooden boards with almost zero soundproofing effect. During every class, the teacher taught mathematics on the stage. The left ear is listening to English, the right ear is listening to Chinese, and the environment is as lively as a vegetable market. Not only was it noisy in class, it was even noisier during lunch break because a group of male students would use the classroom door to play &quot;Aruba.&quot; I was completely familiar with them and joined them a few times. She Yingxin criticized me severely for this several times, you stinky boys, could you please stop being so vulgar! &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Later she felt that we were too noisy, so She Yingxin started bringing MP3 players to class. During lunch break, she would lie on the table with headphones plugged in and read comics. She only listened to a few songs, and her favorite was this article. The title is &quot;Later&quot; by Rene Liu. One time, while she was taking a nap, I secretly put an earphone into my ear. Unexpectedly, she didn&#39;t fall asleep at all. Instead, she leaned on her arm and opened her eyes, staring straight at me. She said this song was good. It&#39;s so romantic, just like a story in a Taiwanese idol drama. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;You know that adolescent boys are also mean. The better someone treats you, the more you try to treat them badly. During those two years when I was my deskmate, I always bullied her. After playing basketball, I would stuff dirty clothes into her desk pocket, put beetles in her pencil case, and secretly repackage her homework books. She also pointed at Pua, the school beauty with double ponytails in the next class, and said, &quot;Look at other people, blah blah, blah blah, they have done a lot of bad things.&quot; At that time, I was sure that I didn&#39;t like her, I just simply liked to bully her. Maybe it was difficult for a boy of that age to really distinguish between these two feelings. At that time, I still liked to play basketball, but my skills couldn&#39;t keep up with my hobby. As soon as the game came, my true colors showed, and I could be beaten for fifty points in thirty minutes. But I still adhere to the principle that girls don’t understand basketball at all and they just like to watch handsome guys. I persevere in brainwashing She Yingxin before every game and let She Yingxin watch it. Finally, it happened once. After the game, She Yingxin gave me the highest praise and said she had a long head. It starts off quite like Rukawa Kaede. I said, Liu Chuanfeng, which class are you in? The next day she was holding a copy of &quot;Slam Dunk&quot; and I said, why is she a little devil? &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Speaking of basketball, I was 179 that year. Looking down at everyone, I seemed to be able to hear the wind when I spoke. I would brag to She Yingxin every three days and say, when I grow up to 183, I will imitate my idol Ivor. Sen plays in the NBA. However, I was embarrassed to say this in high school, because the physical examination accidentally discovered that after two or three years of brutal growth, my height had successfully reduced to 175. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;In the two years of junior high school, She Yingxin often advised me to study hard in a mature tone, saying that studying is like playing basketball. If you can do horse racing in two days, your grades will definitely improve. decline. I always look at her with an incredulous expression: Teacher She, do you think there is room for improvement in my grades? &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;In 2007, he lived up to expectations and conformed to every viewer&#39;s imagination of the uneducated male protagonist in the play. He passed the exam and passed the lowest high school in the city. Next door was the only junior college in Guangyuan. He graduated from high school. That is, college entrance and internal digestion paths have been planned. As expected, She Yingxin went to a key middle school in Mianyang with top grades. After graduating from junior high school, I finally got my first mobile phone. It was an elderly phone produced by a domestic brand called Nokia, which was passed down by my mother. Every night, I would call She Yingxin under the quilt in my dormitory. Every time I entered a number, there would be a loud key tone, 1, 3, 9, 0, and when I pressed the two numbers 88, the whole dormitory collectively went crazy, eh, Son, I cursed in the air, go to hell with you. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Life in a big city has a fantasy tone. She Yingxin told me on the phone that there is a thirty-story high-rise building in the center of Mianyang. There is an observatory on the top of the building. You can see the brightest sky with a telescope. That star, the elevator was still completely transparent, and it reached the top with a swoosh. I asked She Yingxin what the brightest star looked like. She said that it is difficult to describe it in words. Anyway, it is square where it should be square and round where it should be round. In fact, it is just like that. I feel ashamed to say it. Let alone the telescope, I had never even ridden in an elevator at that time. This matter is just like the Bird mobile phone a few years ago. It is a frustration in my life. It is a visual manifestation of the Möbius band going around and rolling into my life. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I started to fall into depravity in the second semester of my freshman year in high school. The cause was my mother’s illness, a cerebral hemorrhage. I was taken to a tertiary hospital in an ambulance. The person in charge said that this situation was very dangerous with the current domestic technology. , but fortunately I know a multinational medical representative, and a new batch of special medicines will treat this, so I can only buy it privately. Grandma couldn&#39;t do it on the third day after eating. I was still in class at the time, and my dad was hysterically going to the hospital to trouble the man with a kitchen knife on his back. He was lame himself, and was restrained by a group of security guards before he even entered the gate. After I arrived at the hospital, I happened to see my dad being pinned down on the asphalt pavement, with his knees on his head. The doctor stood next to him and said arrogantly: &quot;Did I promise it would be successful? Did I promise? Be reasonable. You have to be reasonable.&quot; &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;There will always be some moments of broken dreams in the journey of growing up as a teenager, which can bring you a thousand sailings at the least, or make you catastrophic at worst. But for me, this time comes too early. After burning my grandma, I was depressed for more than half a month. She Yingxin called me on time every night, but I didn&#39;t answer any of them, so she started sending me harassing text messages again, but she didn&#39;t reply much because she went to join the society. My idea at the time was very simple. I felt that if justice could not rely on procedures, then I would resort to violence. I followed a leading brother named Black Panther, whose real name was not so domineering, Liu Chunfang. On the day I paid my respects to the pier, Brother Bao asked me to shave my long hair, saying that it looked too student-like. I refused, and two thugs who had returned from the Shaolin Temple set up a billiard table for me, one on the left and the other on the right, and dripped 502 on my scalp. , in the end I had no choice but to shave it all off, and even now you can vaguely see some of the wounds from that time in the hair seams. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I fought every day for half a month, but it was She Yingxin who really brought me back from the wrong path. In July, for her 16th birthday, she took a four-hour bus trip back to Guangyuan and brought me a scarf that had been sewn for three months. It rained lightly that day, green and ink, and we walked around the school wall. I was separated by The cracks in the wall introduced She Yingxin to aspects of her life. This place was where I played ball, that place was the cafeteria, and the library. She Yingxin kept standing on tiptoes to peek in. When passing by a cosmetics store, I said I wanted to go in to use the restroom. After I entered, I stuffed a lipstick into the sleeve of my school uniform while the clerk wasn&#39;t paying attention. After going out, I took She Yingxin&#39;s hand and ran away, running like crazy along the Jialing River. She Yingxin asked me, but what on earth were we running? But to be honest, I couldn&#39;t answer this question at all, because there was no one chasing us behind us. In the end, we collapsed under a sycamore tree on Binhe Road. She Yingxin suddenly turned her head and said to me a famous saying of Allen Iverson, I know you are sad, but whatever doesn&#39;t kill you will make you stronger. It was in such a moment that she made me realize my own despicability. It’s hard to imagine that a good girl like She Yingxin, who only has Japanese anime in her mind, would be willing to learn about a group of black people shooting football for me. During that time, her QQ space was forwarding this all day long, &quot;Iverson’s Classic Quotations&quot; and &quot; Articles like &quot;Twenty-six wounds do not affect greatness&quot;. I don’t know why, but I actually made a big statement to She Yingxin at that time. I said that I would definitely not be able to get into college with my grades in cultural classes, but I was a fast runner. I had already decided to pursue the path of arts and sports. . &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I didn’t give away the lipstick because I found that when you really care about someone, you can’t give away what you stole. After bidding farewell to She Yingxin at Nanhe Bus Station, I went back and stuffed the lipstick back into the shelf. It can be said that my life trajectory has returned to normal since then, and she has never known about it. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;On May 12, 2008, there was a big earthquake. At that time, I was training with the coach on the 400-meter track. Halfway through, I suddenly felt that the world was turned upside down. I thought that I had gone through a big earthquake. After half a year of hard training, is this from the Qi refining stage to the foundation building stage? Later I found out it was an earthquake. I bypassed the cordon and ran to the middle of Nanshan Mountain to call She Yingxin. I called She Yingxin a hundred times before I got a signal. The moment the call was connected, she burst into tears with a &quot;wow&quot; sound, saying that it was completely dark over there, and when she heard her cell phone ringing, it was as if someone had pulled her back from a nightmare. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Then the road was cut off for two months. She Yingxin was unable to return to Guangyuan. She had to live in a collective life in a tent with other people. During this period, she encountered dozens of aftershocks, large and small. Fortunately, the communication was restored later, and I could call her every night. Sometimes I would hang up the phone first when she fell asleep. Sometimes I would fall asleep first and wait for the call status to be active all night. The phone bill was so high that I repeatedly let her down. My dad questioned me using my mobile phone to vote for a talent show like &quot;Super Girl&quot;. There was really no way to argue. Later, we all got through the most dangerous period of the disaster without any danger. She Yingxin rarely returned to Guangyuan and stayed for a while. She also set up tents. Her house was set up in the Guangzhong playground, and my house was on Binhe Road. My dad still insists on working, riding a tricycle to pull the collected waste to the recycling station on the outskirts of the city, so I often take advantage of the &quot;car&quot; to go to Guangzhong to find her. She Yingxin, who has entered high school, is even quieter than before. She is either reading comics or writing questions under the sun with a small table. There is a large electronic screen in the center of the playground, and in the evening, popular Internet songs from those years are played, from &quot;Seeking Buddha&quot; to &quot;Mouse Loves Rice&quot;. But she never listened to those songs. She still silently put on her headphones and listened to Rene Liu&#39;s &quot;Later&quot; as she did three years ago. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I found that she seems to be a very dedicated person, and this dedication is not dependent on the will of the spectator. She Yingxin likes to walk on the diagonal lines of the grid. She wears a light yellow hairpin like a butterfly on her forehead. Her floral dress never exceeds three colors. She is a devoted person who listens to the same song as others. You feel very dedicated. I specifically consulted her on this matter. Is it true that I don’t get tired of listening to a song for so many years? She Yingxin responded in a very strange way. She held up a math exercise book and her eyes looked like upside-down crescents when she smiled. Don&#39;t you get tired of looking at these calculation formulas for so many years? The opening ceremony of the Olympic Games was the first time I saw her cry with my own eyes. When Li Ning crossed the sea of ​​people on the big screen and reached the top of the torch, she told me that it would be great if those who died in the earthquake could see such a scene. . &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;When I was young, I seemed to have more synaesthesia about life. What impressed me most about those years was the light orange dawn, like an orange, reflecting on She Yingxin You don&#39;t have to think about it in your eyes to know how beautiful it can be. In July 2009, I entered a comprehensive college in Chengdu by running, but as usual, she ran faster than me and ran to Guangzhou. The summer after graduation, my dad got sick with tuberculosis. He lived in the infectious disease ward for two months. Not only did he make no money, but he also spent all his tuition fees on the hospital. So I worked for nearly eighty days, washing dishes in a restaurant during the day, and going to the hospital to bring food to my dad at night. A certain junior high school class reunion happened to be at the restaurant where I worked part-time. I was carrying a plate of food and bumped into a table of acquaintances. All the students present were well-dressed and glamorous. I was the only one wearing a yellow and black apron and dripping oil on the ground. I felt really like that at that time. Find a crack in the ground and crawl into it. It was She Yingxin&#39;s idea that relieved my embarrassment. She deliberately raised her voice and made a very surprised expression: Is it true that the social practice of sports students is placed before enrollment? &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;After working for two months, I felt class for the first time. After paying my tuition, I earned just enough money for a lipstick, so I went back to the cosmetics store where I almost made a mistake on my 16th birthday and bought some. The same lipstick was given to She Yingxin. Her expression was both angry and happy: Can you ask me my opinion in the future? Purple, have you ever seen anyone wearing purple lipstick? I said, if you don’t want it, just give it back to me. She said it was a beautiful thought, and turned to apply it on the reflective surface of the car. She complained while applying it, and there were actually people who would choose purple! &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;It’s a pity that I have never seen such a beautiful sunset again, and it’s even more pity that we were unaware of it at that time. She started school half a month earlier than me. Her route was to take a bus to Zhaojue Temple and then fly to Baiyun Airport. I volunteered to take her to the station on my motorcycle. When I passed a closed junior high school along the way, I happened to encounter a student who jumped into the Jialing River. Seven or eight speedboats were fishing for people in the water, and the red and blue lights on the ground formed waves. After parking the car, we stood there and counted silently for a while. About three minutes later, She Yingxin patted me on the shoulder and said two words, let&#39;s go. So we continued to set off. I motioned to She Yingxin to hold the armrest at the back of the car, but she held my shoulder. She Yingxin told me that there was a boy who chased her very closely. He was also admitted to CUHK and wrote to her. I wrote a poem, &quot;If I love you, I will never learn to climb the sky flower, blah blah blah.&quot; I turned around and said, &quot;Tsk, if he loved you, he wouldn&#39;t write you this kind of limerick.&quot; She Yingxin said, &quot;But I think it&#39;s quite touching. Is there really such a kind of love that doesn&#39;t ask for anything in return?&quot; I said, you always tell me about love. Could it be that you like me? She Yingxin hit me on the back of the head with her knuckles: If only your face were as thin as your wallet. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;When you first arrive in a new environment, the novelty always spurs you to want to do something. When I first entered the university, I was like a pseudo-campus elite. I ran for positions in the student union, signed up for team trials, and added the mobile phone numbers of my sisters in the club all day long. When socializing, pretend to be busy and act very serious. I still remember that a four-member boy band was formed at the New Year’s Eve party. The name was inspired by She Yingxin. It’s not Lun Hei—I have to be Lun You, Suo Hei. She Yingxin said that she can understand this so far when Cantonese people speak. It took the four of them a month to rehearse, but as a result, the guy from the shot troupe team next door sang the wrong tune as soon as he came on stage, and sang &quot;Love More and More&quot; instead of &quot;Have to Love&quot;. Afterwards, I uploaded the live video to Tudou for She Yingxin to watch. At that time, QQ could not upload files, so She Yingxin and I had a shared Tudou account. We did not need to publish the video content into the draft box, as long as we logged in from another place. You can see it. After achieving Internet freedom, I simply had a vengeful desire to share with her, or in other words, with life. I wanted to publicize big things seventy or eighty times: riding a bicycle in place and saying that I was a security guard doing hip exercises, The black international student who is 1.75 meters tall and can dunk the ball, and the painter wearing sunglasses at the school gate: For several months in a row, I sat on the roadside with my head held high. At first, I thought I was blind, but after throwing coins for a few days, I finally He took off his sunglasses and said with a complicated expression, &quot;Young man, I was actually observing the angle of the sunset.&quot; All in all, these vulgar and trivial things are not nutritious, but when put together piece by piece, it can be regarded as letting her intervene in my new life. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;On the other hand, I found that girls are indeed less able to adapt to the new environment. In addition, they are further away from home. She Yingxin called me every three days to cry. She cried about the new environment. My classmates are generally excellent, but I am under too much pressure. The second cry is that my parents have a bad relationship and have a weak sense of family. The third cry is that I have no goals and ideals, and my life is confused. I consoled myself boldly on the phone, life is a wilderness, and the scenery in the process is more important than the destination. The more I talk about it, the more ashamed I feel, because She Yingxin thinks about things from too in-depth a perspective, unlike me, who just muddles along. She only eats and sleeps. During the CET-4 exam, she could even write the wrong admission ticket number. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;&lt;h1 align=&quot;center&quot; data-default-linespacing=&quot;100&quot; data-foldable=&quot;true&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Down&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h1>;&lt; p>;In the winter of 2010, her parents divorced, her father lost his job, and my father passed away. These three things almost happened one after another. In my sophomore year, I tore my meniscus, which ruined my hopes of doing sports, so I started writing some sporadic writing. It was the last glory of the blog era. I mainly wrote some essays, imitating Han Han&#39;s style. I would write outlines with pen and paper in class during the day, and go to the Internet cafe at night to type them out and post them online. I don’t have much talent in this area, and every time I post something online, I get criticized for being stupid. She Yingxin created a small account on the Internet using the vest of &quot;Sad Potato&quot;, and she scolded more than a dozen people by herself. What&#39;s wrong with the unnecessary moaning? Are you eating your rice with the unnecessary moaning? You know people who have just started writing, no matter how bad they actually are, they have a kind of narcissism in their hearts. Every time they finish a &quot;masterpiece&quot;, they force She Yingxin to write a review, and they also limit the number of words. , limiting the angle from which she could praise me. She is also very good at troubleshooting. Every time she can accurately find the only bright spot in a piece of shit, she can freely write two thousand words. Now I think the novel is not as good as her review. Before She Yingxin went to teach, we had some in-depth chats on QQ, and she was considering whether to spend a year doing this. She Yingxin asked me once, what is the meaning of living? I was writing something at the time, so I told her perfunctorily that it was just a task anyway, so I’d give it a try now. She Yingxin sent one, um, and then received three small dots. The next day she called me very seriously and said that she had enlightened. I said, how to say it, master. She said that people should seek happiness in life instead of asking for meaning! &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;But I always feel that she is not truly happy, her smile is just a protective color she wears. A few days later, she asked me if I had any dreams. I said, of course, everyone has them. Do you remember when we were children, we filled out the time capsule. I wrote that I wanted to be an astronaut, and you wrote that I wanted to be an astronomer. Because this way you can watch me go to heaven, haha. She said that things that happened when she was a child don&#39;t count. I said that at this stage, of course I still want to be a serious writer and be able to support myself through manuscript fees. She said, I really envy you for living a persistent and simple life. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Then she signed up for the volunteer teaching project organized by the school. She spent the whole year of her junior year on the Western Sichuan Plateau. After she came back, she could guarantee graduate school with extra points. The guy who wrote the poem for her was also very persistent. When he heard that She Yingxin was going back to Sichuan, he resolutely signed the registration form. In the autumn of 2011, I officially completed my first novel and took a 24-hour express train to Huacheng Publishing House to submit it. When I left Guangzhou South Railway Station carrying a schoolbag of manuscripts, there were vague signs of a typhoon. She Yingxin stood across the road waiting for me, wearing a light yellow floral skirt and a ponytail on her shoulders. The moment I saw her from a distance, I was suddenly in a trance. How to say those four words, it felt like a world away. We are in contact every day, but in fact I haven&#39;t seen her in person for a long time, so she gives me a feeling that she suddenly jumped out of my memories and grew up overnight. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;At the same time, this feeling was amplified by being in a completely unfamiliar city. This amplification made me feel very scared. I stayed in Guangzhou for three days and two nights. On the first day, She Yingxin accompanied me to find the publishing house. There were no mobile maps at that time, so we could only take a handwritten address and take a car to get a rough idea first, and then ask for directions. The temperature dropped suddenly before the typhoon came. She Yingxin was concentrating on writing my name on the steam on the car window, muttering in her mouth, look at this character &quot;Gong&quot;, if you write it faster, it looks like a second force. I said, Chen Erli, this is what his pen name will be when he becomes famous in the future. After thinking about it, I changed my mind and said, forget it, I guess it will be quite difficult. She said, not confident, not like you at all. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;This is not a problem of lack of self-confidence, this is a problem of people and security not letting me in. She Yingxin argued with people with her hands on her hips, the publishing house is owned by your family. Then the two people were kicked out. I originally planned to take me to Huachenghui the next day, but unfortunately a typhoon came. We stayed in the hotel on the 28th floor next to the South Station for a whole day, watching Stephen Chow while waiting for the wind to stop. As a result, a strong wind blew from early morning. Night. If I remember correctly, it was a very cramped single room. She slept on the bed and I slept on the floor at night. After turning off the lights, She Yingxin told me that according to the returning teacher, there was no signal deep in the mountains. She would probably have to contact me then. By writing letters, I only get more than ten days of family leave a year. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;A lot of things happened in the year when she went to teach. Some of them I saw from letters, and some of them I only learned about from others much later. Others were after her buddy, a 185-year-old with a big back, who came to Chengdu during the graduation season to get back together with She Yingxin, but I took a group of sports students and beat her from Shuangliu Airport to Wangjiang River in Sichuan Province. It is very inconvenient to send and receive letters in the mountains. You can only use China Post, which involves many checkpoints. There will be a delay of about a month every time you go back and forth. In the letter, She Yingxin gave a sketch of her life as a volunteer teacher, saying that every time the Red Cross brought supplies, she was happiest because she could talk to people and hear what was happening outside. Naturally, the viciousness of human nature cannot be hidden in the depths of the mountains. She Yingxin finally decided to agree to the buddy, partly because she was moved by him, but also because she sought protection: in the first month she went there, she was asked by a local widower to accompany him for a drink. , and once I didn’t pay attention, I touched a little boy’s Tian Bodhisattva. The next day, Hope Elementary School was surrounded by more than a dozen men - it was the buddy who stepped forward to settle these things. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Therefore, to a certain extent, I firmly understand the relationship they developed during their journey of relying on each other to keep each other warm. No matter what behind this relationship is love, touching, or comfort when they are lonely, To put it crudely, no matter what the nature of things is, there seems to be no man more suitable for She Yingxin than him for the physical needs of life in a foreign land. During that time, I have been looking forward to the ten -day visit of her relatives. She promised to come to Chengdu to find me when she was at first, but later wrote a letter saying no, and an appointment with her boyfriend to go to Lanzhou. I brushed the photos of the two people&#39;s faces in front of the Yellow River Iron Bridge in her QQ space, and my heart intersect. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In 12 years, in the junior, the two returned to Guangzhou in the second week. The incident of breaking up is quite big in their school. Regarding the reason for the reason, the two sides have their own words. The man said that Ying Yingxin has been using him, and Ying Yingxin said that the other party is a performance personality. I know that these are on Baidu Post Bar. For a certain time, the post page of the post -bar of Zhongshan University is discussing this. You and friends of both parties sing and sing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In the same year, I had to take the postgraduate entrance examination because of the deduction of the degree certificate because of the participation in the Diaoyu Islands incident. I do n’t know if it was because of the crackdown of the breakup incident. She gave up the number of insurance research places that I got a year before teaching, while preparing for the IELTS test while internship at school. During that time, our connection became less. Every time I called work, study, life planning, etc., Xun Yingxin said that the lesson of her internship belt was photography of teaching students. From the teaching building, the school road, internal camera, the second half of the school took the teaching building from the school, and the outside. After speaking, I felt wrong. I was silent for three seconds on the microphone, and then the two laughed. I asked her what to do after going out. She asked, what about you, or are you determined to engage in literature? The total of these conversations is about these dialogues. I don&#39;t know if we are busy pretending to be an adult on the fork of life, or because the intervention of the third party has made us get rid of each other. Anyway, the way we communicate during that time has changed completely. More reports, less imagination, more like a routine customer. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; I was lucky to hit the major work of that year, and I was admitted to the Chinese department of a university in Sichuan. Xun Yingxin had been dragged to Britain for 14 years because of a case of a camera under his hand. In 2014, it was a year when WeChat was getting fire in my impression. Many young people on the road were shaking their mobile phones. The platform we shared our lives also officially transferred from space to the circle of friends. The day before the dual -flowing to London, I Yingxin asked me to drink in a folk ballad, knowing that she was happy and lost after applying for the qualifications of Shuo Bo Lian. The difference, only this time I can&#39;t see it. The time we went to the second floor was relatively late. The singer downstairs hugged the guitar and wanted to listen to Jay Chou, or &quot;Later&quot;? After the audience shouted, I was already a little drunk. Looking at the stage, my eyes were hazy. For a moment, I couldn&#39;t even distinguish whether it was ten years or ten years ago. She Yingxin used a mobile phone to record my confused look. The sound of music was very noisy. She could only call her throat closer. Do you believe it &amp; hellip; &amp; hellip; I ask, ah? She said, do you believe that some people in life have never been really together, but &amp; hellip; &amp; hellip; guitar sounds high again, I continue, ah? She stomped her feet and combined her two hands by my ears, but in her heart, she had already finished this life for a long time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The first time I saw Ying Yingxin was drunk, saying unpleasant, in my cognition, she gave it to me. I took a taxi and took Lao Yingxin to the double stream, put her on the hotel&#39;s huge double bed, went downstairs to buy cigarettes, and bought a box of sets by the way. I went upstairs and found that she had taken a bath. She was sitting on the sofa with a bath towel. She just saw the square box exposed, pointed at my pocket and said, holding it away. I took my hand away, and sat down and tilted Erlang&#39;s legs to stop it. She also said that holding her legs away. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Ying Yingxin said, all of them, I number 3, 2, 1. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The condoms are sliding down, a brand with the same name as the paint, Dolex. Xun Yingxin&#39;s face was all red for a moment, and a word of words for a long time, why are you so embarrassed. At that time, I didn&#39;t know which muscle was wrong. From jumping, I held Xun Yingxin in her arms and kissed my tongue. At the beginning, Xun Yingxin started to close his teeth very tightly. Both bite. I shocked like an electric shock, and Ying Yingxin hugged me tightly, she cried, sobbing gently, and I felt that every pore of her was shaking. She Yingxin said in my ear that she was no longer that. I said, I know, I don&#39;t dislike it. She said, I don&#39;t mean that, I don&#39;t want to drag you, you should leave the most precious thing to the person who can accompany you. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &amp; nbsp; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; I haven&#39;t been in contact for a long time. The graduate stage is almost over. After WeChat completely squeezed the use rate of QQ, I decided to close the space I had operated in the past ten years. I opened it to find that there was a private message that I didn&#39;t see. The fate is too deep and the red dust is too shallow. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; After work, I seem to have never seen such a girl again. A Aries, forever, always passionate, afraid of cockroaches, knife mouth tofu heart, like to eat various desserts, always red ears and red ears when they quarrel, sad She cried like an engine, likes to be quiet, likes cartoon characters and colorful stickers, wearing Doraemon&#39;s pajamas, and inconspicuous objects that will be bought as long as the Disney characters are printed. In 15 years, I met my current wife through the introduction of the mentor. She had the same name as a song. The woman who leaned out of the protective bar to see the stars, but she was a good person. On the day of receiving the certificate, I took Xiao Lan back to the place where I grew up when I was a kid. Elderly activity center. When I passed the house downstairs of Ying Yingxin, I stopped unconsciously for a long time. Xiao Lan naturally held her hand on my small arm and tossed a question. What happened? I said, let&#39;s go. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; I see the circle of friends of Ying Yingxin. It can be seen in half a year. The content of the last time was six selfies. She dyed a large golden yellow wave like many other international students and focused on the camera on her newly played. On the lip nail, jump parachute from a high altitude of several kilometers. The copywriting is a string of English, only the strong survive. For so many years, she has always remembered the tattoo on Iverson&#39;s hand. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; My first job is to be a copywriting in a self -media, and I usually write novels and continue to contribute to the publishers and competitions. After a few times, I was dug by a company to make a column and loan. After the first house, the first car, his wife was pregnant with the first child. In the end, Xun Yingxin did not receive her doctorate degree. At the end of 17 years, her mother came into contact with online gaming. In half a year, she lost the assets left by her dad. The small loan platform borrowed money, and the annual interest rate basically exceeded 36 percent of the legal. The east wall was removed and the west wall was removed. The left hand turned and right, and the tuition fees of Xun Yingxin quickly lost. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; 一 &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;after school after school. The first copy is introduced by the mentor. A rule of the rules; the second is the cashier of a convenience store opened by an overseas Chinese, coupled with the scholarship given by the state, basically enough to pay tuition and rent a house. The urging company is also very capable. A Cross -Ocean phone called directly on Ying Yingxin&#39;s mobile phone, showing her a picture of her door full of red paint. When she said that she would not come back, the mother and daughter may not be able to see it. She Yingxin asked me for a long time on WeChat and talked to me about this. I advised her to be a little restless and said that the current online loan companies are all such a routine. Maybe the photos are composed of computers. Guangyuan, then you make a decision. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; After I found that her mother was sick and mental illness. Listening to the neighbors who said that there were people who fucking foreign accents came to her house every day. Specked things, stood on the balcony in the middle of the night, singing in English, my heart in the Titanic is eternal. I asked my neighbors how much I owe. They said how to know this, and it is estimated that there are hundreds of thousands. Ask again why don&#39;t you help call the police? Answer, the parties did not say who dared to travel to this muddy water. It was ugly, and the repayment of debts was originally a matter of nature. So the alarm, after the alarm, must first criticize and educate the act of violent debt collection. After negotiating, it is also specified that the debtor&#39;s direct relatives came. This also led to the end of the end of his studies in the UK. After returning to China, the principal was repaid, and only the principal was repaid, and the interest returned to zero. I almost asked for a week of leave to accompany Xing Yingxin to deal with these things, watching her mortgaged all the real estate, and finally the debt pickers who were stained with a little underworld moved. In the second phase, there are 4,000 per month. I said, don&#39;t be so troublesome, I just happened to be a little idle. She Yingxin stopped my hand and said that the relationship is different now. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Driving Ying Yingxin and her mother went to Chengdu. When I ran the high speed, Li Xianglan called me and asked me when I went back. I said, on the road, she said that she always felt that the fetal movement was not too peaceful. I know if he feels that his father is gone. I said, what is this, his dad is flying back to see him. Hanging the phone, Ying Yingxin opened the window to the maximum highway railing of the speeding highway. It was normal when her mother was not on the disease, but she was stuffed with her head to sleep in the back row. I also shook the window and lit a cigarette. The one hundred yards of wind remittance came in like a wave. She Yingxin asked me when I learned. I said that junior high school will be. I am afraid that you can go to the toilet with them. She said that it was the child&#39;s dad immediately, what was the thought of me and your wife. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; 做 Yingxin did an unexpected behavior. She reached out and took out the cigarette box and lighter out of my pants pocket, turned her head to order one. It should be her first smoking. , Cough straight. She asked me again what the child planned to name. I said, Chuanfeng. She said, real Japanese. She asked again, do you still write novels? I nodded first, and then shook my head. I didn&#39;t answer. The radio was released &quot;Radio Love Song&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; After returning to Chengdu, Ying Yingxin voted for his aunt who retired. At that time, the real estate business was in the ascendant. First, he went to a real estate company for sales. Her image is good, her academic qualifications, and their ability is good. I have done such a job without technical barriers. Only one thing is to drink every day and accompany the business representatives to a cup of land and 1573. In the days when Xiaolan&#39;s expenses, she happened to meet Li Yingxin with her mother in a psychiatric review. Our big gang came in in the elevator and just met her to push the wheelchair. For the sake of big, I always feel that her state is not very good. I glanced at Xiao Lan, and then went out to help push her mother to the hospital department. The two chatted a few words. She said that Chuan Feng must notify her on the day of birth, and even five digits of difficulties, it would be better if she could recognize her as an godmother. I said yes, then his English will be responsible for you. You know, my family has not respect the soil outside the Yangmei since childhood. She said, I hit you, this is called Shi Yi&#39;s long skills. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The weather in the early winter is very cold, and the obstetrics and gynecology department is afraid that pregnant women will be cold. A pot of charcoal fire is added under the central air conditioner. I started to write a novel again. I thought I was going to stay with a little thing to dedicate to Chuanfeng, who was about to come, but my thoughts were chaotic. I just think about the title of the novel. It is called &quot;Later&quot;. In this world, even the two charcoal sticky together has their own later. Therefore, there is no need to worry about the problem of fit. It is universal. On January 1, 18th, the first ray of the rising sun under the fireworks, Chuanfeng was born, 6 pounds, a particularly detrimable fat boy. I violated my promise and did not tell Ying Yingxin this matter, but she followed her promise and adopted a way I couldn&#39;t refuse to refuse: she transferred 26,178 yuan to my bank card, that should be her All money. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In the summer of 18, Xun Yingxin was engaged with a local local in Chengdu. The inside and the system is a good match. On August 5, she was found in the medical examination that the double lungs were shadowed, and they were further confirmed as a malignant tumor. In December, Ying Yingxin left the world. &lt;/p>; &lt;/p>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>; Responsible editor: Mei Boxi &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; See @ONE Studio on Weibo.
