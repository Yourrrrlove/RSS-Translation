Contact us when you need it, and it can still be kept fresh when you don’t contact us, and the longer it lasts The stronger the relationship. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;The maintenance of friendship &lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;needs to pay, give and receive equally, it will not overflow &lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;in&lt;/strong>; &lt;strong>;In friendship, we will not have too many&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;extravagant expectations, and we will not fall into disappointment. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Love is different. The essence of love is self-love&lt;/strong>;. When you love someone, you are always so generous, even if you give everything to fill your own empty possessiveness, &lt; strong>;Love&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;’s&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;giving is conditional, there is a&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;price&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>; and it needs to be reciprocated&lt;/strong>; >;&lt;strong>;. &lt;/strong>;So once love occurs, the balance of balance between people will naturally begin to tilt. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;From the moment I fell in love with you, the relationship between us can no longer be described as pure, because what follows is possessiveness, sensitivity, clinginess, and suspicion. When you cross the boundary of friendship and fall in love, you will never be satisfied with the status quo. You will think randomly, care about every punctuation mark the other person sends, how many seconds it takes the other person to reply to the message, and who the other person talks too much to. After a few words, your heart is already in chaos. Friendship is not like this, or friendship is not always like this. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;So once the boundary is crossed, &lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;friendship &lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;is no longer pure. As long as you are tempted&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;, you will not&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;be willing&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;to be friends&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;There are two results at this time. Either you show your love and the other person is willing to continue to be ambiguous with you and eventually achieve success, or your love becomes a burden to the other person and makes them choose to be confused and escape. , once the flame of love is ignited, it will burn stronger and stronger, and eventually your friendship will be burned to ashes. We all know that it is difficult to be friends&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>; if you don’t love them. >;&lt;strong>;The&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;same&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;principle&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;, love arose between&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;friends I can’t be friends&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I know that people who fall in love don’t think so rationally, and irrationality is also the reason why feelings make people want to stop. So you will test, you will give, you will reveal, either implicitly or directly, in short, you will have countless troubles. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;If after you try it out, the other party does not give you satisfactory feedback,&lt;strong>;My suggestion is, &lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Don’t&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;throw away friendship because of love&lt; /strong>;. A person will fall in love with many people in his life. Maybe they can make up for the shortcomings in your heart, maybe they can bring you expectations for life, but one day they will be separated because they no longer love each other, and they will become strangers. , this is not a rare thing. &lt;strong>;Love is a selfish guy, when it slips away all the&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;intimate&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;s will become indifferent&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;,&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong >;It will not&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;create an ounce of pity for&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;your aching&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;heart&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;s. Friendship&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;is different, it is what we choose, the person who knows us best&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;It is not so hot but can warm you&lt;/strong>; &lt;strong>;One&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Lifetime&lt;/strong>;. Love does not necessarily start with confession, but friendship must end with confession. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Sometimes it is good to be friends and they can last forever. In order not to destroy this pure relationship, you need to stop the loss in time, break off the relationship or disappear for a period of time, leaving it to yourself. Time will extinguish the spark in your heart. Only when you see that there is no wave in his heart again can you continue. Of course I know this is difficult and painful. This is the punishment brought to us by crossing the line. Of course, you can fight for love like a moth to a flame. If you want to have no regrets in life, then you must be prepared to lose your good friends forever, because if you are not together, there will always be a veil between you, even if it is true. When we are together, we also have to bear the risk of love being broken, from deep love to no chance to see each other again. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The choice we face looks simple but is actually very difficult: &lt;strong>;Either be a clean &lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;friend&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;,&lt; /strong>;&lt;strong>;Either be an open&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;lover&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;,&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;or be simple&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>; The&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Stranger&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;s. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;/p>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;Editor in charge: Mei Butan onewenti@wufazhuce.com&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Please see the @ONE Studio pinned Weibo for information on the call for papers.

The expectation of an ideal life rests on fantasy. As far as the cost is concerned, mentally taking a vacancy is much smaller than actually taking action. &lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Why don’t you speak? &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;What do I have to say? &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Why are you angry again? &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Don’t you know the reason? &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;On the five-kilometer road, it was impossible for her to coax him. If it was eighty-five kilometers, maybe she could. It&#39;s not that his temper has something to do with the length of the road, but if he holds the steering wheel tightly and stares at the same field of view for a long time, fatigue and relaxation will occur unexpectedly, like a special drug that will lower the defense threshold. The road was not long enough and the scenery was not monotonous. He looked highly nervous. The muscles on the right side of his face were tight and thin. He must be on full defense. She couldn&#39;t coax him anymore. This is not the first time this has happened, and it will not end from now on. Her mother told her that marriage is a gamble. The stakes are too high and the outcome is determined by one round. But she didn&#39;t believe her mother&#39;s words, look at who her mother married - trapped in a bad marriage for more than forty years, like a spider trapped in its shabby web. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;But she had better be prepared: tonight he will be so angry that he will skip dinner, go to bed with resentment, lift up the sheets, turn over, and turn his back to her insulatedly. In the darkness, it will be so quiet that the wind blows the curtains. All can be heard clearly. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;They had a quarrel because they were late for dropping off their children. She put on her clothes, and her sleeves exposed the butterfly flesh left after childbirth, so she changed into another outfit. And he paced impatiently back and forth in the living room. After she changed, she found that Ni Ni was wearing shoes instead of shorts. She hurriedly changed her clothes, and Ni Ni kicked and kicked, and he complained, and the weather was hot, and she was sweating all over, but she managed to get Ni Ni dressed. When she wanted to change into a fresh top, he simply got angry, closed the door with a bang, and went downstairs to &quot;clean up&quot; first. Nioni cried loudly, and she also wanted to sit on the ground, but she simply refused to go down. But the clock went to seven-fifty. Eight-ten is the time for children to have breakfast. There is no need to delay the children&#39;s breakfast for a trivial quarrel. She picked up Nioni and went down to the fourth floor. He sat in the car like a sniper ambushing an enemy. He didn&#39;t open the door for her, she knocked on the window, and he glanced at her. She knocked again and he opened it. That&#39;s just him. It was only after she got married that she clearly saw his temper. She was already pregnant at that time. As my mother said, she had bet too big. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;As a result, on the way, he overconfidently took a detour, and the originally ten-minute journey was stretched to twenty minutes. She looked out the window while stuck in traffic. &quot;Look, we&#39;re even.&quot; ’ she said. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;What do you mean? &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;I mean why did you choose this road? Don’t you know there will be traffic jams here during peak hours? &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;If you had changed your clothes earlier, this road would not be blocked. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;If you had chosen the original path, you would have arrived long ago. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Forget it. They were caught in the gap between cars and cars. Hot sweat made her clothes wet and clinging to her body. She didn&#39;t sweat easily before, but after giving birth, her pores opened up. She turned on the air conditioner. He shuts down. She turned away again. He was twisting and turning on the safety seat uneasily. He turned it off again. The car moved. A warm breeze blew outside the window. They finally passed through the hustle and bustle of the early morning and the mundane daily life, and drove to the kindergarten. Like a standard loving couple, they waved goodbye to their children and turned around with a smile. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;After sending the child off, they originally planned to go to her parents’ house to discuss the demolition of the house. Their house in the city center is old and small, only about 40 square meters. She grew up from more than 40 square meters. If it is demolished, they may get a house with a ratio of one to two. But for a place that is too narrow and cramped, twice the size does not mean spacious. The advantage of convenience is eliminated. They were going to discuss this matter with their parents, how to toughen up their mother who had been weak all her life. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;But now, we are still in a quarrel atmosphere. The atmosphere was like two uneasy slaps across their faces. She couldn&#39;t have known that marriage, while interpreting the joy of getting along day and night, also gave it an inescapable fear. He stopped on the side of the road at a chain butcher shop they frequented. He didn&#39;t say anything, but she knew he was asking her to buy meat. Because he never goes to his parents-in-law’s house empty-handed. Not empty-handed does not mean generosity, sometimes it is due to unfamiliarity. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Linlang’s meat is like a part of the animal left here. She asked for a little of this and a little of that, being careful not to spend more than she wanted. He always had a limit on how much money he could spend. He didn&#39;t need to make a footnote, but she could feel it. As a result, she ran into trouble when paying. She forgot to bring her membership card and the discount could not be used. The clerk raised his head and saw two men waiting in line behind him. Her uneasiness turned into a stream of hot sweat dripping down her neck. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Use mine? &amp;rdquo;The man at the end of the line said. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;This offer can only be used once a day. &amp;rdquo;The clerk’s voice was very stereotyped. Forgive her, she is just a cooked food seller. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The joy she had just been aroused was extinguished in an instant. But the man smiled and put the items back in the freezer. &amp;ldquo;Actually, I can buy it tomorrow. &amp;rdquo;He said. He lowered his head and gave her the card number. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Oh, wouldn’t that be troublesome? Thank you so much. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The man is good-looking, clean and about thirty-five years old, which means he is about the same age as her. His card comes in a black card sleeve. Wearing sportswear, the whole body is fresh and the eyelashes are very long. When he was close to her, there was a softness in his voice. He went out the door. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;She put the bag away and returned to the car. He took it and glanced at the label. Put it in the back seat. At this time, she saw the man also get into a white car and drive away. She kept her gaze fixed. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;What would happen if she just asked for his phone number? &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;She would say: &quot;Thank you so much. What&#39;s your number?&quot; I can go home and give you my discount card. ” He nodded: “Okay.” &amp;rdquo;Then they would exchange phone numbers. At night, with her husband&#39;s back turned, she sent him a text message: &quot;Sorry, I just remembered it.&quot; My card number is...&quot; The screen lit up in the dark. She had never had this kind of expectation after getting married. It was like digging into a log and waiting for the moment when the fire started to rise. He said, &quot;Just take it and use it. I live alone and can&#39;t use it anyway.&quot; &amp;rdquo;Why did he tell her he lived alone? Isn&#39;t this a hint? It&#39;s almost made clear. But everyone seems to know what a married woman is like - the loneliness that comes after a long drought. But she won&#39;t send him anything more, she can&#39;t reveal too much. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Another day, my husband was on a business trip. She bought meat alone and planned to go to her parents&#39; house to spend a few days of &quot;lazy days&quot;. Without a husband, life is as refreshing as being single again. They met again, she walked in, and he was about to pay. She said: &quot;Wait a minute, I must come this time.&quot; &quot;He showed a gentle smile again, that smile was like boiling water that has just cooled down after boiling - just waiting for you to drink it all. &amp;ldquo;Okay then. &amp;rdquo;After they went out, they looked at each other&#39;s plastic bags to see what was in them. He bought beef and she bought hairtail fish at a discount. He said he was particularly good at fried hairtail and the secret was wine and vine pepper. She didn&#39;t believe he could cook any better than a woman, but his cheerful look made her want to laugh. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;His apartment is very sophisticated. On the third floor, you can see the bustle of the market through a window. He cooks and she helps. &amp;ldquo;What to do with the rest of the wine? &amp;rdquo;He shook his secret. They each poured a glass. The evening breeze blew the sandy-yellow curtains like the sound of the Sahara Desert. &amp;ldquo;Why don&#39;t you get married? &amp;rdquo;she asked him. This question is not excessive and is just the right amount of ambiguity. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;I have never found the right one. &amp;rdquo;This is also the standard answer. Standard, but not honest. There is no such thing as &quot;suitable&quot; in this world. In the end, everyone finds the &quot;suitable&quot; one. Sometimes, &quot;make do&quot; will also appear as &quot;appropriate&quot;. He said: &quot;I fell ill, and my first love of ten years left me.&quot; &amp;rdquo; His expression was painful, and he saw the vertical line between his eyebrows. This is not good. Ten years of dating will form a barrier that will exclude other women. He said: &quot;I have been abroad and don&#39;t want to find a foreign woman to marry. I just came back this year. I didn&#39;t expect to get married so early here.&quot; I have become a monster. Friends introduced me to people who were either divorced or completely ignorant. I want to say, where have the mature women gone? &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Perfect. She looked at her watch. Seven o&#39;clock in the evening was a very good time. The sky automatically descended to the earth and reached chaos. This chaos heralded something and gave birth to something. It erased all the original boundaries and started anew. At this time, the phone rang, and her husband&#39;s voice came over in a low voice. The sky appropriately started to rain. That layer of chaos is inextricably connected. She had to say goodbye. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;My mother is talking about the notice from the neighborhood committee. The father rushed to speak. His mother scolded him as if scolding a five-year-old child. The father sat across from them aggrievedly. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Be tougher and unite with the previous neighbors who are in the same situation. ’ she said. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;But why should we be tough? &amp;rdquo;My mother said. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;He was playing with his phone indifferently. She poked him, and he coughed and cleared his throat: &quot;It&#39;s not up to us whether to dismantle it or not.&quot; If it needs to be dismantled, dismantle it. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The mother’s mouth trembled, she noticed. She thought that her mother probably wanted to leave this small home as soon as possible, the sooner the better. But going to school is indeed a problem, and they have no money. Since she quit her job in the bakery, &quot;money&quot; has been elevated to the status of a family member. She specializes in making bread at home. This is the thing about doing business: when you watch others doing it, you think the word &quot;simple&quot; can explain it, but when it comes to yourself, you are either unlucky or just can&#39;t memorize it well. She saw a piece of yellow batter stuck to her hand and wiped it on the chair. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The mother said: &quot;But if we change it, the house can be bigger.&quot; It’s also convenient to help you look at your dick. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;She frowned: &amp;ldquo;It doesn’t matter about the second child, we don’t have such a plan. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Why? &amp;rdquo;My mother said. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;No reason. ’ she said. She looked to her husband for an alliance. He lowered his head and looked at the four walls surrounded by mirrors. She could see the line between his brows. Originally, she would see it during quarrels, but now it has become a regular routine, and she also raises the thread when she laughs, even though he laughs only a handful of times. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Ran Weimin, don’t you want the second child? &amp;rdquo;The mother shifted the question to him, seeming to understand who has the final say in the family. My mother has always had this ability to be very precise about housework. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;She suddenly realized that this was the first time they had faced this matter together. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;This is not a discussion. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;She glanced at him. His eyes were full of weariness, an expression he would perform on time as soon as he arrived at his parents-in-law&#39;s house. She foresees a quarrel on the return trip. Luckily they have a car now. On the wedding night, when they didn&#39;t have a car, they took their bags and went to the bank to deposit money. There was another quarrel on the road. It was the first quarrel. The content had long been forgotten, but the remaining traces of anger were remembered. She took out a wad of money and threw it into the midnight street. The money swirled in the wind and floated gently, so weightless. She stood in the middle of the road, waiting for someone to knock her over. But before that, it is best for him to wake up and coax her well, so that he will not &quot;lose both his life and wealth&quot;. He did that too. So on the wedding night, from the moment the two of them squatted on the street to pick up money, she kept pressing her red toast dress with her inner thigh. Otherwise, the skirt will run up to the buttocks - since then, they have been living a life of delusion that they can &quot;find money&quot;. From then on, she could no longer wear the tight cheongsam, or there was no occasion to wear it. They lost two hundred dollars that day. They have always used the two hundred yuan as a spur: quarreling and losing money. But how can we live peacefully without quarreling? The good thing about having a car is that no matter how noisy it is, outside the car window is outside the car window, and inside the car window is inside the car window. The losses are reduced and the frequency is increased accordingly. There is no way, everything has two sides. Later, as the process of having a child failed, they quarreled more. Later, in order to recuperate her health, she resigned from the bakery. One day, she was wearing cool clothes and a washed-out apron, and he hugged her from behind. That was another peak they reached after their marriage. It was a watershed moment, as this romance led to an actual appendage: Nioni. Since having her, the relationship between them has become watery again. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;I have an umbrella, can I give it to you? &quot;Language trap, she will think, should I give her an umbrella or send her home?&quot; &amp;ldquo;Actually, I have been observing you for a long time. &amp;rdquo;Out the door, he said. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;I have nothing worth observing. &amp;rdquo;She looked at her leather shoes that were soaked by the rain. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Does it look like they are playing a symphony? &amp;rdquo;&amp;ldquo;What? &amp;rdquo; she asked. &amp; ldquo; It ’s Yun, Rain, Ping Ping Pong, Bang Bang &amp; Hellip; &amp; Hellip; &amp; rdquo; she raised his head: &amp; ldquo; I learned drumming when I was at school. &amp;rdquo;Why mention drumming? &amp;ldquo;Drumming? Is that the kind of drum set? &amp;rdquo;Yes, I played very well and my rhythm was pretty good, but then I wasn’t in the same mood. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Oh my god, this can’t go on. How do people flirt nowadays? She walked back, but he followed her. She confirmed this. She raised her voice: &quot;I&#39;m sorry.&quot; &quot;She turned and looked at him, &quot;Hello, I want to say, we don&#39;t know each other. If you&#39;re ugly or you haven&#39;t helped me, I might call you a pervert, or call the police if you follow me. But you are really talented. I am old, ugly, poor, and got married too early. What are you trying to do by following me like this? &amp;rdquo;He actually continued to laugh. If this continues, she might think of him as a fool. She raised her voice: &quot;I&#39;m telling the truth - I don&#39;t look good at all. Because of the oligohydramnios and the caesarean section I had, my belly is covered with melon rinds and a scar.&quot; . I may never wear a bathing suit again, what are you laughing at? &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;You are not ugly, and your scars will not be ugly either. What does it look like? Don&#39;t mind, I learned a little bit about Western medicine abroad. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;She quickly looked around and lifted up her short coat. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Oh, that’s a nice recovery. Really, it&#39;s like a map, you see, all the melon skins - those roads, all lead to your heart, you are so kind and kind. &quot;His voice deepened, &quot;Have you ever worked in a bakery? ” he asked suddenly. That&#39;s right, that&#39;s right, this explains why he can single her out from all the other creatures. &quot;I bought your cake before. When I was on a business trip the year before last, I was terribly unlucky. My mobile phone and wallet were stolen as I was about to walk back to my dormitory. It seemed to be the Dragon Boat Festival that day. There were lights and colorful decorations all the way. I was so hungry, and the aroma from the cake shop was too strong. &amp;rdquo;She would look at him carefully in surprise. He continued: &quot;I&#39;m so embarrassed. I gave you the five dollars in my pocket and said just give me a piece of bread.&quot; Later I realized that with only five yuan, I couldn’t afford anything. As for you, you thoughtfully advised me to buy those short-term breads. You said they were actually delicious and at a good price. You said you would buy this yourself. &amp;rdquo;&amp;ldquo;That’s the best bread I’ve ever eaten. &amp;rdquo;He said. Okay, let’s explain, the mystery of fate. One moment you are overwhelmed by life, exhausted and just struggling to survive. The next moment you think that you have gone through a lot of hardships, so you have the right to eat forbidden fruits in the world. This man appeared between the last moment and the next, without missing even 0.1 seconds. It was then that she turned her face to meet his gaze, and she felt him reach out and hold her. There was a sudden sound in her head, mixed with voices, breaths, and a sonata of pots and pans - in a nutshell. Right—the sound of a middle-aged married woman reining in her horse from the brink, but maybe it’s a spur? &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;At night, he took off his shoes and polished them. I was holding a small second-hand plastic top that my grandpa bought at the market. He put down the shoe polish and snatched the toy over: &quot;I told you, there are bacteria.&quot; &amp;rdquo;He glanced at her and saw that she was talking to him. A woman ordered forty-eight bunny buns for her children&#39;s birthday party. She wiped the flour from her eyes with her elbow, but it only smeared more. Seeing him approaching, she said, &quot;That woman actually wants forty-eight buns, forty-eight!&quot; &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;But what he said was: &amp;ldquo;I told you not to take the toys her grandpa bought. I&#39;ve told you several times, but you just don&#39;t listen. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;He has already bought it. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;That’s how he is. Life gets worse as time goes by, because he would rather buy a basket of rotten apricots than a single good peach. &amp;rdquo;He said. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;She put down the dough and rubbed her fingers: &quot;Then, I should break his heart, and then no one in the world will care about me, right?&quot; &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;I think you are looking for trouble. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;I can’t speak to you. When it comes to debate, you are number one. But this is how our life goes. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;What are you dissatisfied with? &amp;rdquo;His feet stood up slightly, making him appear a little taller than his own height of 1.7 meters. But still a little shorter than her. &amp;ldquo;We bought a car and a house. You live in it and you have clothes to wear, otherwise, you would still be sleeping in more than 40 square meters! &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;You are so great. do you know? When taking out a loan to buy a car or a house, it seems like no one would plead hard with the bank! &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;He threw the tight top at her face. The top rubbed her face and hit the wall, but it hit somewhere. Ni Ni started to cry. Although her crying sound was always like &quot;Hahaha&quot;. Her tear ducts were not well developed when she was a child, so it took some effort to distinguish whether she was crying or laughing. It was now clear to them that they argued too much in front of their children. But there is no way yet. She said: &quot;Have you finished losing your temper?&quot; &amp;rdquo;The oven rang, she put a plate of bread in it and came back to knead the dough. He was still standing there: &quot;What do you mean by not having a second child?&quot; &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;I thought you knew that raising one is difficult enough given our conditions. On Naoni&#39;s birthday, you can only buy her a balloon. And my business is just picking up. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Business? &amp;rdquo;He said, &amp;ldquo;You call this business. This rabbit thing? How many are sold in a week? &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Forty-eight. I&#39;m going to make forty-eight tonight. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;He said: &amp;ldquo;You can’t make a fortune even if you do four hundred and eighty. You just make 4,800, 48,000... She kneaded the dough so hard that she couldn&#39;t control her tears and ran into the dough. She wiped away her tears and continued rubbing, pretending that she was rubbing his face and his internal organs. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;She told him how her husband had humiliated her. They sat up and drank beer. The beer was taken out of the refrigerator, and it was cold and refreshing. Her naked body was half spread out on the sheets, half erect. Her breasts weren&#39;t saggy from breastfeeding or her nipples were enlarged, so she was showing. He stroked her melon skin lines and rested his head on her thick thighs. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;How about you leave him? &amp;rdquo;He said. She admitted that she had thought about leaving her husband a thousand times, a thousand times. When she went crazy and accused him but he didn&#39;t say a word, she even considered strangling him to death, just to avoid seeing him being with another woman after they divorced. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;He put the phone into her hand: &quot;Call him and tell him that he is a fool and that he missed the best woman in the world.&quot; Just say it. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;She shook her head. Looking past the window, I saw the roof covered with slowly falling snowflakes. &amp;ldquo;We are not all bad. &quot;The head of the bed was next to two rows of smooth radiators, which gave off silent warmth. She crossed her arms and hugged her chest. &amp;ldquo;I was in the bakery at that time. My mother hoped that I would find a job with good conditions. She always said, &quot;The conditions are good, the conditions are good.&quot; As if someone with good conditions would like me. The boy she introduced me to on a blind date was less than five blocks away from our home. He was the son of the owner of a two-story building. My mother took me over and said, &quot;Look, if you marry him, you will change your destiny.&quot; &amp;rsquo;Really, don’t laugh, that’s what she said. The boy had just returned from a career change. His last girlfriend dumped him or something, and he was pretty depressed anyway. I know he&#39;s a good guy, that&#39;s for sure. But the call just doesn&#39;t come. You know how that is. Not interested anyway. Don&#39;t laugh, of course the meaning you understand is correct - I don&#39;t know what to say if I call quickly, and I&#39;d rather be alone. By the way, when he asked me out, I didn’t even wash my hair. But when he met Ran Weimin, by the way, his name was Ran Weimin. We talked from eight o&#39;clock in the evening until one o&#39;clock the next night. As soon as I meet you, I will wash my hair to make it flowing and fragrant. How did we meet, you ask? It was at a colleague&#39;s wedding that he added me to Renren, and we never stopped talking on the phone. My mother pushed open my door and yelled at me, meaning that I must abide by women&#39;s rules. But I was just on a blind date, and suddenly I understood that I couldn&#39;t meet that boy. Even if I couldn&#39;t be with Ran Weimin, I wouldn&#39;t choose him. You see, love is like this. It starts out as a primitive impulse. Without impulse, there is no love. Sorry, did I say too much? Why don&#39;t you speak? &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;What else do you want me to say? &amp;rdquo;He said coldly. The heating in the room seemed to have stopped. She felt cold. She puts on her clothes. He looked at her. She wrapped herself in her coat and it was still too cold. Putting her hands on the radiator, she felt the fine dust that had accumulated all winter. The snow falling outside the window became more violent in the darkness. This is the method taught by the teacher when I was a student - to create an atmosphere. Maybe it wasn&#39;t colder outside than inside, she thought. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;She sent the forty-eight bunnies over. Received a call the next day. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Hello, thank you. &quot;The other party said, &quot;All the children shared the bread. A bit salty in some cases. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Maybe it’s the smell of tears. She should rename this bread &quot;Sad Bunny.&quot; &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The other party said: &quot;By the way, my baby got that gift.&quot; &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;What gift? &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Huh? Isn&#39;t that top a lucky draw? When I was little, my mother would wrap a coin in a dumpling, and whoever ate it would be lucky. I thought it was this. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;She stared at the flour spread on the table: &amp;ldquo;Yes. It&#39;s a lucky draw. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;What will you eat? &amp;rdquo;The woman giggled. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;There will be...&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;she paused, &amp;ldquo;a discount code for a chain store. Your home is quite close to there. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Okay. &quot;The other party&#39;s voice sank, but quickly came up again, &quot;Actually, that&#39;s not bad. It&#39;s a lucky draw after all. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Yes, and the hairtail there is very fresh. When is it convenient for you, can I send it to you? &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;On the way to pick up his children from school, he stopped at the intersection and she went down to give him the coupon code. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;When she came out, she happened to meet the man who had shared the coupon code with her. But he was not empty-handed, instead he was carrying a beautiful and petite girl on his arm. She stared at him, her eyes almost gleaming with fire, as they turned the corner. She took two steps and caught up behind them. She heard him laughing, and the girl raised her face. Oh my God, the radiance and joy on her face overflowed. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;She was shaking all over, and her hands hanging down could not be clenched into fists. She took out her mobile phone and tried desperately to delete it all, delete him, delete his number, delete his text messages, delete them... She flicked the phone for a while and raised her head. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The clear August sun shines on her, how lucky she is. She stretched out her hand and held the top that the woman handed back. This is a lucky draw. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;She returned to the car. He picked it up and twisted his body. He looked at her: &quot;What are you happy about?&quot; &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;I am happy. ’ she said. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;He also smiled: &quot;I am also happy that you are happy.&quot; How happy you are. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The car started driving and kept driving until it snowed in winter. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>;&lt;/p>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;Editor in charge: Nana&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This article is selected from the July 2022 issue of &quot;Grand View Tokyo Literature&quot; . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Author&lt;/p>; &lt;hr style=&quot;margin-top: 15px;&quot;/>; &lt;table>; &lt;tr>; &lt;td style=&quot;width: 50px;&quot;>; &lt;img src=&quot;http: //image.wufazhuce.com/Fu2-00Cezw2brQ60u1WkHieXp7FY&quot; alt=&quot;Qian Xing&quot;>; &lt;/td>; &lt;td>; &lt;div>;Qian Xing&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10px&quot;>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>; &lt; /div>; &lt;div style=&quot;&quot;>;A big river was born in my heart, and it flowed regardless. &lt;/div>; &lt;/td>; &lt;td width=&quot;60px&quot;>; &lt;!-- &lt;span onclick=&quot;OneAPP.openDetail(2, )&quot;>;Follow&lt;/span>; -->; &lt;/td>; &lt;/tr>; &lt;/table>; &lt;p>;Related recommendations&lt;/p>; &lt;hr/>; &lt;table>; &lt;tr>; &lt;td style=&quot;width: 40px;&quot;>; &lt;span>;Reading&lt;/span>; &lt;/td>; &lt;td>; &lt; a href=&quot;/article/6108&quot; data-ajax=&quot;false&quot;>; &lt;div>; Gaze &lt;/div>; &lt;div>;Text/Ren Buran&lt;/div>; &lt;/a>; &lt;/td>; &lt;/tr>; &lt;/ table>; &lt;table>; &lt;tr>; &lt;td>; &lt;div style=&quot;text-align:center;padding:5px;&quot; onclick=&quot;OneAPP.openDetail(2,6118)&quot;>;Click to download ONE app&lt;/div>; &lt;/td>; &lt;/tr>; &lt;/table>; &lt;/div>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 04 Oct 2023 06:25:02 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[VOL.4015]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://m.wufazhuce.com/one/4151]]><description>&lt;div>;4 Oct. 2023&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div>;&lt;div role=&quot;main&quot;>; &lt;div>; &lt;img src=&quot;http://image.wufazhuce.com/Fn9V81Py2nelIFb1nCvB17rBkARv&quot; alt=&quot;Homepage Picture&quot; />; &lt;p >;&lt;span>;VOL.4015&lt;/span>;Illustration | Alex Shuper&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;4&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Oct. 2023&lt;/p>; &lt;div>;&lt;/div>; &lt;p>;For others Living is actually the simplest way to live. &lt;/p>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 04 Oct 2023 06:25:02 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
