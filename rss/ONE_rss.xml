I often stuff my wallet with all kinds of brain teasers and funny jokes so that I can take them out during the cold scenes to make everyone laugh. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;In fact, I am not a very humorous person. On the contrary, when I am alone, I am very serious and never laugh. Later, I saw an article in a magazine that said that Hollywood comedy master Jim Carrey has been suffering from depression for many years. At that moment, I seemed to be looking in the mirror and caught a glimpse of my depressed self. It turned out that my liking to make people laugh was not out of nature, but just because I wanted to &quot;be liked&quot;. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Being a comedian is safe and easy to gain popularity, but comedians are not as lively and cheerful in private as they appear on the big screen. &lt;strong>;From then on, I realized that we are actually playing different roles unintentionally every day. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;In front of the boss, I am the good-natured employee who nods and bends, and looks serious about his work. But when I take off my work clothes, I just go to the livehouse. Underground youth watching the show. There are often such reverse photos on Xiaohongshu. For example, when working, they are teachers, nurses, and scientific researchers. After work, when they put on their own clothes, they have restored their inner personality. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;In nature, small animals will change the color of their skin or perform other camouflage in order to protect themselves. The same is true for human beings, but the external environment we face has changed from mountains and grasslands to urban forests filled with all kinds of interpersonal relationships. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;We show different &quot;personalities&quot;, on the one hand to protect ourselves, and on the other hand to integrate into society. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;As a social worker with more than ten years of working experience, I have performed the following three personalities at work. The first &quot;personality&quot; is called &quot;love to go to work&quot;, and its specific manifestation is not leaving after work, sitting at the work station fishing, watching other colleagues leave, and then I dare to secretly clear my bags. Leave. In such a company, the atmosphere is depressing, because the boss loves to judge whether you are serious about your work based on your daily performance, and acting as a person who is &quot;not in a hurry to get off work&quot; will give the boss the illusion that you love your job. hard working. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;My &quot;second personality&quot; in the company is called &quot;Basic Xiao Li&quot;. What does it mean? That is, I can collect hot news or entertainment gossip as soon as possible, and then retell it to my colleagues. It’s not that I really like to gossip, it’s just that discussing these things is safe and harmless and has nothing to do with me. If we discuss anything else, my colleagues will easily lead the topic into private areas, and I don’t want anyone to pry into my true privacy. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;In the company, I also have a personality called &quot;a generous person&quot;, which is reflected in the fact that I often bring snacks or other delicious food to share with different people. Although it is just a small favor, over time, it will leave the impression that you are a nice person. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;In the company, &quot;acting&quot; is for promotion and salary increase, and to build good relationships with colleagues to prevent them from saying bad things behind their backs and hurting others; in the family, &quot;acting&quot; is for the sake of making others happy. Parents feel at ease to avoid complications; &quot;acting&quot; in front of classmates is mostly to have a good reputation and make life easier in school... &lt;p>;For the sake of performance, we hide our true selves, which seems to violate the declaration of young people in the new era of &quot;being yourself&quot;. But in society, like ink dripping into a pool, there is no distinction between black and white. Many times, truly &quot;being oneself&quot; brings not the admiration of others, but disgust. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Influenced by Confucian culture, most people in East Asian societies prefer to be low-key and modest, while being independent is often seen as ostentation. &lt;strong>;So, hiding one’s true personality may be a good idea. This is an ancient cultural tradition that, to a certain extent, can protect us. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Of course, people will become tired after wearing a mask for a long time. When we take off our disguises at night, we also ask ourselves, do we really have to do this? If we completely expose our true selves to others, will there be no way for us to survive? &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;In industries with a high degree of socialization, such as law, medical care, finance and other fields, personality is very important, as it represents professionalism. In areas with more freedom, such as advertising, entertainment or coffee shops, it is easier to &quot;be yourself&quot;. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&quot;Should we create characters?&quot; This is actually a false proposition, because everyone faces different situations. Therefore, we often talk about a concept called &quot;work life balance&quot;. The profound reason behind it is that it is difficult for people to take off their guard while at work. Only when they are off work can people find themselves. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;When I was younger, I was more disgusted with words like &quot;long-sleeved, good at dancing, and all-rounded&quot;, but over the years, I feel that properly &quot;acting&quot; is not a bad thing. &lt;strong>;Sometimes, the true self is sharp or fragile, and being completely exposed in this dangerous jungle society may be more dangerous than we imagine. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;/p>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;Editor in charge: Zhou Ziheng onewenti@wufazhuce.com&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Please see @ONE Studio’s pinned Weibo for information on the call for papers.

Distance neither creates beauty nor creates barriers. When you are reluctant to take that step, distance will be a kind of emotional sustenance and protection. &lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;We have known each other for a long enough time. If I remember correctly, it should be three weeks and two days. The time is marked in the chat history It is estimated from the time when they first greeted each other. All in all, it&#39;s time to meet. According to Miss Tian&#39;s previous experience, this kind of thing should be brought up by the other party on her own initiative. It is not easy for a girl to initiate the invitation, but the other party has not said anything yet. She still greets her good morning and good night, and has various daily sharings and At the beginning, he asked her to cooperate with some commands. It seems that this is already a signal to start dating. When the ambiguity reaches a certain level, the sweetness needs to be appropriately weakened. If it cannot be realized, it is just like an illusion of love. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Miss Tian is too afraid to alert others. Just like several previous relationships, as long as the other party sends enough signals, she will involuntarily lower her guard. Once she reveals her interest in the other party, love seems to Just reached the end. This kind of thing has happened several times, so it is impossible for Miss Tian to do such stupid things again. In later stories, as long as the other person is always in a free state, she will not rush to confirm it. Dates, meals, and sleeps can be carried out as usual, but the relationship is definitely not established by herself, and she will become a hunter waiting for the opportunity. , is the key to taking the initiative. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;But at least we have to meet each other. If we haven’t even met someone, it seems like nothing can be discussed. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;At first, Miss Tian was attracted by his voice. A nice voice often gives this person extra points, at least in Miss Tian&#39;s opinion. She saw the other party&#39;s photos and videos on social media, and sent them to several friends for verification. After confirming that they were not pig-killing dishes, she started the next step of contact. The first time the other party said good night to her, it was when she and a few little sisters were on their way home from the Workers&#39; Stadium. She was slightly drunk at first, and with such a fatal voice, the love was instantaneous. Every morning after that, I will get the first good morning, the sharing of getting up, the sharing of the journey, the sharing of work, the sharing of lunch, the sharing of getting off work, and the sharing of returning home. It seems like starting to watch a person&#39;s reality show, some A viewing experience composed of words and pictures. This kind of online dating will add filters along with these clues. She only knows that he works in the Financial Street, often travels on business, and has to fly to many places. Sometimes he is on vacation abroad, and he may fly there on the weekends. Other countries. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;If you don’t like someone, you definitely won’t talk to her so much. If he is chatting with several people at the same time, then she must be on his key watch list. In any case, for Miss Tian, ​​this state of not being in love but being in love made her very satisfied. She began to peek into his circle of friends and felt relieved that there were no likes from any common friends. She was the only one who knew him. People who did not interact with anyone in any social circle slowly turned into a kind of exclusive person in her heart. She looked at the photos he sent, of hiking, camping, drinking coffee, and visiting bookstores. Sometimes they were in the background of meetings, with tall buildings and his apartment. Although she had never really seen him, she seemed to be involved in his Whole life in general. One night, he finally sent her an invitation. It wasn&#39;t really an invitation, but it at least indicated the possibility that the relationship might take a further step. He asked her what her plans were for the weekend. She subconsciously thought that he was going to send her an invitation. However, when she said she had nothing to do at home, the other party said, &quot;It&#39;s so boring. I should go fishing in the suburbs on weekends.&quot; It was him, not them. When she looked at the chat message and was at a loss what to do, she could only smile bitterly and say, teach me next time. As a result, the other party said that I wasn’t very good at it and was just fishing for fun. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The conversation did not continue, and later the man named KUSO disappeared. Ms. Tian realized that she had been too exposed, as if she had inadvertently revealed her emotional needs. Her best friend told her that when it comes to men, especially men who are attracted to you, you have to play hard to get. The more you want to talk to him, the more you have to stay away and wait for him to find you. Of course, Ms. Tian knows that this technique of flirting between men and women in the city is only suitable for some people. Everyone has a completely different personality. For some people, if you don&#39;t take the initiative, he will withdraw. Fortunately, he sent him good night in the end, and she didn&#39;t reply. She stared at his circle of friends again, and then fell asleep. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;This state has been going on for quite some time, from three weeks to a month, she went from a rabbit waiting to be hunted to an impatient cat, clawing at the sofa. After a few times, the frequency of chatting did not decrease, but Ms. Tian no longer knew the meaning of her indulging in it. Later she realized that it was because the right person didn&#39;t appear around her. Although this man named KUSO did not come to her, at least he was handsome, funny, gentle and considerate, without the greasiness of common men. He flirted without hurting her. As time went by, Miss Tian couldn&#39;t help it anymore. Doubtful, did she really meet a real person? Or an AI like Chatgpt? &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;One day, Ms. Tian was severely punished by her boss for an hour for mishandling her work. When she returned to her work station, she sent all her complaints about the boss to KUSO. KUSO was very upset. He quickly used his witty jokes to relieve her depression, and then made a far-fetched agreement, saying, &quot;When I&#39;m free one day, I&#39;ll come to your company to have afternoon tea with you.&quot; Miss Tian said yes, but when? She couldn&#39;t ask the second half of the sentence. Asking would be a sign of cowardice. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Miss Tian’s happiest moment is when KUSO goes to the gym at eight o’clock every night, and then posts a group of photos without shirts on. He is not a muscular man with big muscles. He is a type with well-proportioned lines but great sexual tension. He likes to pat his back, arms, and side face that looks cool and naughty. But Miss Tian never liked it, because he never liked her either. During the game, they held each other&#39;s hands and chatted enthusiastically, but they would not appear in the public eye, even in the circle of friends. Private place. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Gradually, Ms. Tian changed from a passive observer to an active presenter. She began to manage her own life and posted some decent and beautiful parts to her circle of friends. Although she Not sure if the other party will see it, but it doesn&#39;t matter. In every process of collecting likes, she will find several secret admirers who covet her. These people will like her the first time she posts, and then say some specious love words below. Miss Tian will not reply but they all Keeping it in mind, she finally received her first like from KUSO on the plane coming back from Hong Kong. It was a night scene on Taiping Mountain. She deliberately put on a melancholy posture, which was different from her usual cheerfulness. They are all different, but this touching moment is probably the moment that moved the other person. Miss Tian was sitting in the cabin watching the clouds and the clouds, but she felt extremely comfortable. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;However, that was all. KUSO neither asked her about her trip to Hong Kong nor took any further action. After returning to Beijing, Ms. Tian began to reply to messages sent by KUSO intermittently, and sometimes even deliberately did not reply. She began to get a little tired of this cat-and-mouse game, began to linger on social software, and began to look for new goals every day. I saw all kinds of good-looking people on it, but once I started chatting, I found that none of them could impress her. Although they also had pretty good skins, their voices, the way they chatted, and the content of their conversations were none of Miss Tian&#39;s. Point. What makes Ms. Tian even more angry is that her insipidity did not cause KUSO discomfort, and he did not even ask why her attitude changed. His circle of friends was still prosperous, and it seemed that whether she existed or not, he was related to her. She didn&#39;t have much contact. This attitude forced Miss Tian to regret herself, internal friction began to arise, and the projection of emotions became an uncontrollable fact. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;She still likes him, even if she has never met him. On Christmas night, they restored their original contact. She liked the photo he sent of the Christmas tree and the lively banquet, and then KUSO said Merry Christmas to her. It was like they were back to the way they were at the beginning, chatting with each other but not breaking things. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;They did not have a more intimate name, but they gave each other nicknames. Because KUSO was a pig, she would also call him Zhubao, because she always liked to add an ellipsis after the chat content, so he Call her a little bit. After having the exclusive title, the relationship took on a different shape until one day, KUSO asked for Miss Tian’s address and said he wanted to give her a gift. Ms. Tian was still vigilant and did not reveal her home address. Instead, she sent the location of her company. On New Year&#39;s Day, she got a box of chocolates. This may be an opportunity, or it may give her some courage. She finally told KUSO, let&#39;s find a time to meet. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The other party quickly replied, OK. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;After almost two months of waiting, they finally decided to meet. For Miss Tian, ​​this was quite a grand event. She had been choosing clothes in her wardrobe for a long time, and she had spent a lot of time in perfume. He also put some thought into his choice. He sent him the address of a fairly quiet restaurant, and everything seemed to fall into place. But Miss Tian suddenly received a call from work and had to rush to rush out a form at home. In order not to ruin the appointment (mainly worried that there would not be another time), she hurriedly turned on the computer and started busy. When people are anxious, their makeup will become ugly. , the skin would become oily, and time was so short. She finally got everything done half an hour before the meeting. After sending the email, she decided to ignore any work anymore and packed up to go out. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;In the rickety car, she encountered the biggest traffic jam of the century. Miss Tian looked at herself in the rearview mirror and suddenly noticed that her false eyelashes had flown off. Not only that, because she forgot to spray makeup setting spray, her entire face began to become greasy. The car lights hit her face, and the two nasolabial folds appeared. Somewhat obvious. She looked in the mirror and tried hard to reattach her eyelashes, but a sudden brake in front of her caused her to hit the front glass. Her mood collapsed at this moment. She looked at the driver next to her, who was about twenty-seven years old. He looks like an eight-year-old, wearing a peaked cap, and has a good-looking profile. Will KUSO look like this? She didn&#39;t know, it was just that the other person was driving, listening to loud music, and then spit out the window. What if KUSO was also such a person? After meeting KUSO, it seemed that all the topics they could talk about had been exhausted during this period of time. Could she create any new topics? She could just listen to what he said. Ms. Tian understood that after meeting, the first thing she did was to destroy all the filters in the online chat. Maybe he didn’t look good at all, or maybe his temperament was completely different from the one in the photo. What if he really looked like that? Ms. Tian&#39;s forehead began to swell, and she felt a burning part, as well as a message from KUSO asking her where she was. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;She breathed a long sigh of relief and said to the driver, drop me off at the subway station ahead. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The driver asked, are you sure? &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;She nodded and quickly got out of the car. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;She glanced at the subway entrance, and then hurriedly walked down. The clattering train arrived. She glanced left and right, and finally got on the train. It was in the completely opposite direction to the date place. Tian The lady felt that this was right. She looked at KUSO&#39;s circle of friends again, and then typed a line in the chat box: I suddenly fell ill today. Let&#39;s make an appointment another day. I&#39;m sorry. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;She looked at herself in the subway window and she still looked good. Of course, there was nothing wrong with her. However, she was too afraid that he was not good enough, and if it wasn&#39;t, that would be bad. &lt;/p>;&lt;/p>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;Editor-in-charge: Li Jialong&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Please see the @ONE studio pinned Weibo for information on the call for papers.
