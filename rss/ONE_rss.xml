The tables and chairs are scarlet. Although divided into zones, the partitions are all hollow and have no sound insulation effect. Coupled with the special structure of the ceiling, there may even be strange echoes. For example, we can hear the conversation of the people at the top table, but it is difficult to hear what the person sitting in front of you is saying clearly. You need to be able to read lips. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;So the four of us leaned forward in a strange posture, as if we were plotting something. Xiaoqin said that this store is so popular and there are a few internet celebrity dishes that he must try. She read a bunch of them, such as spicy rabbit head, pig brain flower, pickled cabbage vermicelli and so on. A Ming and I have no objection. It doesn&#39;t matter to us what we eat. But Yihang is saying that this will work and that will not work. Xiaoqin carefully followed his instructions and carried out the task of ordering dishes. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Crayfish, do you want them minced with garlic or fried in oil? &amp;rdquo;Xiaoqin asked me. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I was about to answer when Yihang overcame me: &quot;Don&#39;t order crayfish.&quot; &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Xiaoqin and I looked at each other, but she didn’t say a word. Nothing like her. I pointed to the LOGO on the table - a very prominent sign &quot;XX Crayfish&quot; and said: &quot;Aren&#39;t we here to eat crayfish?&quot; &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Yihang smiled and shrugged: &quot;Okay then, you can do whatever you want.&quot; I won’t eat it anyway. &amp;rdquo;He has a handsome appearance and an innocent smile. The store was noisy, but his voice was not drowned out. Xiaoqin thought about it and ordered a large portion of fried crayfish. Yihang shook his head and looked at her with a sweet smile on his face. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Xiao Qin asked cautiously: &quot;I remember, crayfish are edible, right?&quot; &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I felt unfamiliar with Xiaoqin like this, so I unconsciously took my hand off and placed it on A Ming’s lap. A Ming squeezed my hand, probably indicating that he felt the same way. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Yihang answered Xiaoqin seriously: &quot;The crayfish itself is fine, but this cooking method may not be suitable.&quot; The ingredients are quite complex and there must be a lot of sugar. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Oh... &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I couldn’t help but pinch A Ming’s thigh. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I introduced Xiaoqin and Yihang to each other. It has only been three months, and their relationship continues to heat up, just like the current weather. Yihang is a new colleague in my workplace. To be honest, I don’t know much about him at all. I only know that he is a prime bachelor. Many aunts are vying to introduce him to someone, and they have arrangements almost every weekend. One day Xiaoqin came to pick me up from get off work and caught a glimpse of Yihang from a distance, which made me greedy. In order to help her match up, I went to get close to Yihang Tao, found out his schedule for blind dates, and used every opportunity to make a plan. Xiaoqin was also very ambitious and defeated many competitors to win him. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Just a small problem. After Xiaoqin moved in with Yihang, she discovered that they couldn&#39;t eat together. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Do you know about ketosis? &quot;When Xiaoqin told me for the first time, I didn&#39;t think it was distress. &quot;It&#39;s just to quit carbs and control sugar intake.&quot; This is a very healthy diet. So you see that Yihang is in such good shape and is five or six years younger than his peers. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Xiaoqin also followed Yihang’s footsteps and started eating healthily. He lost 12 pounds in a month and his appearance returned to its peak. It was probably her action and willpower that impressed Yihang, and the relationship between the two became stronger and stronger, and it felt like they were about to start talking about marriage. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;But suddenly one day Xiaoqin told me in frustration that she had a craving for sweets, and this thought frightened her. I didn&#39;t quite understand her fear, so I said I&#39;d just eat it if I was greedy. But Xiaoqin said: &quot;No, I can&#39;t betray him.&quot; &quot;They used such a serious word as betrayal, which made me feel a little bad.&quot; &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;So today A Ming and I are not here to eat, but to see Yihang. From a woman&#39;s perspective, I very much agree with Xiaoqin&#39;s aesthetics. Yihang is thirty-five years old, but has thick hair, bright eyes and a strong body. He looks like a mature man, but when he smiles he is naive and his tone of voice is soft. This contrast moved Xiaoqin&#39;s heart very much. But who is Xiaoqin? Four words can sum it up - he acts recklessly. I have never had a long-term job, nor have I been in a long-term relationship. If you&#39;re not happy, just say goodbye. There is no such thing as compromise in Xiaoqin&#39;s life. Anyway, this was the first time I saw that she could love someone like this. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I thought her tone of voice when she said &quot;Really&quot; was a bit funny, so I deliberately teased her and said: &quot;Honey, are you really not going to add instant noodles to the soup base?&quot; That is the soul of crayfish. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Xiao Qin bulged his eyes, trying not to show a fierce look. I really want to act like a cute and cute kitten in front of Yihang. She held onto Yihang&#39;s strong arms and said, &quot;Since quitting carbohydrates, I have opened the door to a new world.&quot; I think you can try it too. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;To be honest, I was tempted when I saw Xiaoqin losing weight. I also asked A Ming, would it look better if I lost ten pounds? A Ming said, whatever happens to you is fine. He is a person with no independent opinions, and his catchphrases are &quot;I listen to you&quot; and &quot;You have the final say.&quot; I gave up this idea. Amin and I are both mental workers. We can hardly work without carbohydrates. I would rather have a bloated body than a slow brain. Besides, if you can’t even eat what you want after work, then what’s the point of working hard? &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;A Ming had no interest in this like me, but he was very polite and just to find something to talk about, he started chatting with Yihang. So I listened to everything about ketosis and how to get in shape after losing weight. Being thin is nothing, getting into shape is where the suffering begins. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Xiaoqin raised his arms and began to explain: &quot;When I first lost weight, there was worship meat here, which was so ugly.&quot; Yihang taught me a set of exercises. Do it for half an hour every day for fifty days, and you will witness a miracle! &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I subconsciously looked at my arms, wondering who would care about my bye-bye meat. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Yihang continued: &quot;The other important point is the abdomen.&quot; After losing weight, the abdominal muscles will relax and sag, and the internal organs will also sag, which is particularly bad for health. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;A Ming looked down at his belly, and I took a look too. When he was sitting, the fleshy thing protruding from his waist looked like a leather ring. He was a lean teenager when we met, so when I closed my eyes, he wasn&#39;t what he is now. Maybe he views me similarly. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;When Xiaoqin heard that we planned to get married, she asked me: &quot;Aren&#39;t you tired of it after so many years?&quot; I&#39;m tired of seeing it. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I replied with a playful smile: &amp;ldquo;Just watch it less. &amp;rdquo;The thought of facing the same face for the rest of my life is a little uncomfortable. But if it were anyone else, I would feel very uncomfortable. Habit is a terrible inertia, and I can&#39;t fight against it. Life already has many gaps, there is no need to add another one. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Xiaoqin&#39;s hand reached out to Yihang dishonestly, stroking back and forth on his waist, his eyes curled into crescents. That look in her eyes made me think she was a pyramid schemer. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;A Ming asked: &quot;How long does it take to train the abdominals?&quot; &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Keep practicing for half an hour every day. Xiaoqin said, picking up the phone and swiping, &quot;I&#39;ll send you the video link.&quot; &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I wanted to say no, but Amin’s cell phone made a message notification sound. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Xiaoqin began to hold his chin and said: &quot;Actually, what bothers me the most is practicing the jawline. I have practiced it for a long time, but the effect is not obvious.&quot; &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;A Ming was a little surprised: &amp;ldquo;How to train the jawline? &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Xiao Qin pouted his lips high, raised his chin, and kept turning his head to the left and right. Yihang corrected her movements slightly, raising her chin higher. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;This seemed a bit ridiculous and I couldn’t help laughing. Of course Xiaoqin knew what I was laughing at. She frowned and thought I was very rude. A Ming also felt bad and secretly tugged at the corner of my clothes. I swear I tried my best to hold back, but I just didn&#39;t laugh so loudly. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Fortunately, a basin of oily red crayfish saved the embarrassing scene. The main dishes we ordered finally arrived on the table, with a tempting aroma, which is indeed the signature of this restaurant. I handed out disposable gloves to everyone, and Yihang took them aside and looked like he really had no intention of eating them. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I think of Xiaoqin’s ex-boyfriend, who was broken up because he grabbed the last crayfish on the plate. It seems that this kind of thing will never happen to Yihang. Maybe he is Xiaoqin’s Mr. Right. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I tried to persuade Yihang: &quot;You should also eat some. Crayfish are full of protein, nutritious and healthy, and the most important thing is aphrodisiac.&quot; &quot;Xiaoqin glanced at me proudly, which means we don&#39;t need it. I seem to understand that Xiaoqin just gave up one desire for another. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The sun has already set, and the city has not yet cooled down. All kinds of lights are vying to add fuel to the sultry night. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The restaurant was packed, and there were many customers waiting for a table outside. The effect of air conditioning was weakened by this hot scene. Sweat secreted from between the hair and dripped down the neck, and soon the chest and back were wet. Xiaoqin wore a very thin V-neck shirt, and when it got wet, the outline of her underwear was revealed. She didn&#39;t care at first, after all, she often went out without wearing underwear before. Yihang picked up his sun protection clothing from behind and covered her body. Xiaoqin blinked at him and whispered thank you. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Actually, have you noticed that crayfish has only become popular in recent years? Suddenly everyone is keen on eating crayfish. &amp;rdquo;Yihang held his hands together, as if he was about to start a profound conversation. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;We couldn’t help but slow down our eating so we could listen to him. At least it was hard for me to listen to him talk while sucking on the crayfish head. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;I had never seen this thing when I was a child, and I didn’t think it was delicious the first time I ate it. But in recent years, it has become more and more popular every year. This is actually marketing, constantly brainwashing you to make you want to eat crayfish during this season. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I said: &amp;ldquo;It’s just that you haven’t seen it before. We often ate it when we were kids. Xiaoqin and I also went fishing for lobsters in the river. We could catch a bucket of lobsters in one afternoon and take them back for the adults to cook. The most common dish in late-night snack stalls is crayfish, which is a must-order for every table. You think it suddenly became popular, maybe just because you went to a place where crayfish are abundant. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Yihang tilted his head and glanced at Xiaoqin, but Xiaoqin lowered his head to eat and didn&#39;t say anything to me. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;That’s not what I meant. &quot;Yihang smiled politely, with the corners of his mouth grinning at a nice angle, like a teenager, &quot;As you said, originally it was just a dish. The dish should be an option that appears on the menu, but it has become a symbol. For example, this whole street is dedicated to eating crayfish, and everyone calls it Lobster Street. Isn’t this the result of marketing hype? &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;This is a plan. In addition to Lobster Street, there are also Hot Pot Street and Suofen Street...Xiao Qin interrupted me while carrying a crayfish: &quot;The last one is for you.&quot; &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I was flattered and waved my hand quickly, saying I didn’t dare, but the crayfish had already fallen into my bowl. In order to shut my mouth, she actually gave me the last shrimp. A twinge of jealousy welled up in my heart. I took off my gloves, wiped my hands clean with a wet wipe, and followed Yihang&#39;s example, clasping my hands together. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;I think crayfish is popular just because it is delicious and has nothing to do with marketing hype. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Yihang looked at Xiaoqin with that innocent look again: &quot;Do you think it tastes good?&quot; &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Xiao Qin nodded, shook his head and said, &quot;It&#39;s okay to eat it once in a while, but it won&#39;t taste good if you eat too much.&quot; &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Yihang said: &amp;ldquo;Right, I believe that no normal person would eat crayfish as a dish. If it weren&#39;t for marketing advertising, who would be thinking about eating crayfish all the time? There are also similar &quot;How can there be no fried chicken and beer in the early snow&quot; and &quot;The first cup of milk tea in autumn&quot;. Aren&#39;t these all the ideas of merchants? &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;That’s not true. “The first cup of milk tea in autumn” is a hot internet meme. I don’t think milk tea merchants can come up with such good copywriting. &quot;How can there be no fried chicken and beer in Chuxue?&quot; is a line from a Korean drama. I guess the screenwriter didn&#39;t expect it to have such an effect. &amp;rdquo;I knew I was a little too serious, which caused our table to fall into silence for a while. Xiaoqin must be scolding me in his heart. In fact, I also scolded her in my heart. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Just when we had nothing to say, the lively discussion at the table above us reached us. Like I just said, because of the special construction of this restaurant layout, it has an echo. I don&#39;t know if reverberation is the right word, but their voices were amplified, like a loudspeaker. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;They were talking about a topic. Recently, a short video titled &quot;McDonald&#39;s Angus Burger Appraisal to Find Women&quot; suddenly became popular. The blogger made a serious analysis. If the woman does not hesitate to order Angus Beef Burger, she must be wary of her or stay away from her. She is probably a womanizer. Netizens were quarreling over this. Some people saw it as a joke, while others took it seriously. The people at the table were also divided into several camps. One person said that if you love someone, you won&#39;t care about these things. One party said that it is best to be AA when you have just met and not yet fallen in love to avoid trouble. The other side said, who wants to fall in love with someone they just met? &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Amin found an opportunity to lighten the atmosphere and joked: &quot;This time, Angus Houniu Fort won.&quot; &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Yihang nodded and said: &amp;ldquo;This is a successful marketing. Reverse publicity, the topic became popular, and the burger became popular. The public is still enjoying making fun of it, but they don’t know that they are being played by the merchants. In fact, this is how the crayfish economy works. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I really didn’t want to hear him continue talking about crayfish, so I changed the topic and asked: &quot;Then do you think it means anything when a girl orders the most expensive hamburger?&quot; &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;No matter how expensive a hamburger is, it’s not that expensive. I don’t think it’s a question of which burger to order, but that men shouldn’t take women to McDonald’s. High calorie foods are not healthy. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Xiao Qin had an expression on his face that said, &quot;You are right,&quot; and his eyes were full of admiration. I can no longer tell whether she is acting or showing her true feelings. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Although using McDonald’s as an example is a bit exaggerated, you can still tell something when watching girls order food. Smart girls will order according to the occasion. If it is just for one person, cost-effectiveness will be the priority. If it is a treat, then both face and lizi should be taken into consideration. It should be acceptable in terms of face and not uncomfortable in lizi. &amp;rdquo;In order to prevent me from opening my mouth, A Ming started talking. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I asked back: &quot;What if a girl deliberately picks something expensive?&quot; &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Yihang responded: &amp;ldquo;That means she wants to test the man’s financial strength. This kind of woman is too scheming. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I said oh, my tone deliberately long, and I stared at Xiaoqin. It seems that Xiaoqin has even abandoned her usual dating rules. Who said that a country is easy to change but its nature is hard to change? If a person wants to change, he may not even recognize himself. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The waiter came to replace the bone plate, saw that the lobster pot was empty, and asked if he wanted to remove it. Xiaoqin said to remove it. I said another crayfish. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Xiao Qin stared at me blatantly: &quot;Do you like eating crayfish so much?&quot; &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Isn’t it what you like? &quot;I also imitated Yihang&#39;s smile, &quot;The four of us could kill twenty kilograms of crayfish before, but where are we now?&quot; &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Four people? &amp;rdquo;Yihang captured the key words. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Yes, Xiaoqin told you about that ex-boyfriend, right? They got to know each other because of eating crayfish, and finally broke up because of eating crayfish. It was so interesting. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Is that the younger brother? &quot;Yihang grinned and narrowed his eyes, showing two crow&#39;s feet. Even so, his expression still looked very charming, &quot;She told me that a game anchor is very unreliable.&quot; &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Xiao Qin finally couldn&#39;t help but took over: &quot;He is too young, still a child, and not sensible at all.&quot; Those who seek pleasure and live in debauchery every day are not serious. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Yihang crossed his hands on his chest, looking very happy, &amp;ldquo;I would like to hear it. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;What’s good to hear? I&#39;ve told you all. &quot;Xiao Qin whacked his arm twice, &quot;He was the one who made me gain more than ten pounds and allowed me to eat late-night snacks, drink milk tea, and show off desserts. When we are together, apart from eating, drinking and having fun, we do nothing serious. I thought it was an unhealthy relationship, so I ended it. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Yihang didn&#39;t seem to be affected by this, still maintaining a sweet smile: &quot;Oh, how do you feel now?&quot; &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Xiaoqin suddenly puffed up his chest, stretched his neck, and felt his whole body stretched out, with a pleasant smile on his face: &amp;ldquo;I like myself now, I feel nourished . I learned to resist those mundane and boring fun, spend my time in the right place, and everything is developing in a good direction. &amp;rdquo;After saying that, she snuggled against him again. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;A Ming repeatedly praised: &quot;This is the best love. Two people grow together and become better.&quot; &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The Xiaoqin in front of me reminds me of the middle-class housewives in American TV series. She always shows a standard smile with eight teeth, turning sideways to match the husband beside her, as if she is not a husband, but a man. president. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;In addition to crayfish, the aromas from various foods such as grilled fish, dry pot, and teppanyaki are mixed together to form an over-saturated atmosphere. The smell, like the vast swath of highly saturated colors in front of you, makes people dizzy. It&#39;s really not a pleasant place to be. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The waiter brought the second portion of crayfish. Xiaoqin pointed at me and said, &quot;Put it in front of her.&quot; &amp;rdquo;That tone sounded like he was trying to draw a clear line between himself and the crayfish, or in other words, he wanted to draw a line between him and me. A Ming said he was full too, so I had to face the large pot of oil-fried crayfish alone. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;At this time last year, Xiaoqin was drinking beer from a bottle and eating crayfish that her brother had peeled for her. Her sweaty hair was stuck to her neck in strands. Although her makeup was all gone, she still looked lively. Fragrant. Now she is really sitting opposite me, but she is like a phantom. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Well, I thought about it carefully and found that crayfish is indeed not that delicious. Maybe it is really the result of marketing hype. &amp;rdquo;While eating crayfish, I raised my hands in surrender. In this way, Xiaoqin should be satisfied. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;When Yihang heard what I said, his eyes suddenly lit up, full of childlike innocence, and he said: &quot;Yes, I have long thought that there is a problem with the idea that crayfish drives consumption.&quot; If crayfish are not available, there are other alternatives. In fact, the consumer demand of the public is there, and crayfish appeared in time to fill this gap. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;What you say makes sense. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Until now, it has become a culture. In fact, the public may no longer need it, but it still occupies this important position. The price of crayfish has been falling in the past two years because there are more and more farmers, but sales have fallen instead of rising. This is an imbalance between supply and demand. On the surface, it seems that this market is still prosperous, but in fact it is an illusion, and the avalanche is not far away. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Amin interrupted at the right time: &amp;ldquo;Unless there is another product that can replace it. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Although I was holding a crayfish in my hand, I still tried my best to applaud A Ming and said: &amp;ldquo;Everyone’s emotional needs are just there, and someone happens to appear and fill them. vacancy. But it doesn&#39;t have to be him. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Yihang looked confused at the sudden turn of the topic. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Amin needed a girlfriend, and I happened to appear and fill the vacancy. But then I discovered that he needed a smart girlfriend who could order food. Obviously I am not such a person, and I will not become such a person, so there was an imbalance between the supply and demand of this vacancy. So I decided to quit and have someone else take my place. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Amin was also confused. He turned to me and asked: &quot;What are you talking about?&quot; &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;I&#39;m just making an analogy. For another example, Yihang needed a girlfriend, and Xiaoqin happened to show up, but she discovered that Yihang needed a girlfriend without fat, so she tried her best to make herself meet Yihang&#39;s standards. At the same time, she felt very happy. Being nourished, everything is developing in a good direction. This is the balance between supply and demand. They are a match made in heaven, a divine couple. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Yihang laughed again with crow’s feet, obviously very satisfied with what I said. The corners of Xiaoqin&#39;s mouth unexpectedly drooped, like a fish out of water. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;A Ming protested: &quot;You can&#39;t praise and criticize others, and what I just said is only the public&#39;s opinion and does not represent my personal opinion.&quot; &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;What is your personal opinion? &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;A Ming was stunned. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;You don’t even have a personal opinion, you only agree with others. &amp;rdquo;The way I spoke made A Ming angry. I&#39;m not usually like this. At this moment, A Ming looked at me the same way I looked at Xiaoqin, very distant. I took off my gloves and wiped my hands with a wet wipe for a long time. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Our silence makes the environment noisier. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Xiaoqin’s face was not stained by sweat, but his eyes were dark, like a gambler who lost money. She picked up the phone and said it was too late, it was almost time to go back. I took a look and saw that it was only half past nine, which to her was the best time of the day. I advised her to sit still for a while. The alarm clock on her mobile phone rang. After pressing it, she said, &quot;I ate too much and I have to go back to practice my waistcoat line.&quot; &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Why do you want vest line? &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Too much, you went too far today, you know? &quot;She finally became angry, and her fair face was filled with a terrible red color, &quot;I am very happy now, shouldn&#39;t you be happy for me? &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Of course I am happy. I wish you happiness. &amp;rdquo;I smiled helplessly, and then a piece of news popped up on the screen of my phone. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;When Xiaoqin got up, I said, Li Wei is gone. Xiaoqin turned around and stared at me, and I said it again. Xiaoqin put his palms on the corners of the table, and after a while, he slowly sat down. Yihang and Amin didn&#39;t know what was going on, so they asked me a few questions before they figured out what happened. The songstress with her bright, infectious smile passed away. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Xiaoqin suddenly reached out to stop the waiter and said, &quot;Two bottles of beer, cold.&quot; &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Yihang stared at her in surprise, his expression still smiling, and asked: &quot;Are you crazy?&quot; &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;I’m going to the bathroom. ” The moment Xiaoqin burst into tears, he turned around and ran away. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;A Ming sighed and said: &quot;She must be Xiaoqin&#39;s super idol.&quot; &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Yihang also said: &amp;ldquo;Yes, Xiaoqin likes her very much. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;No, you don’t know anything. I wanted to say it, but I didn&#39;t say it. It turns out that there are many things that couples don’t talk about. We don’t even understand each other well enough, so what are we loving? Is it just the body you love? &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Colorful neon lights enveloped me. I was standing outside the bathroom, and Xiaoqin&#39;s cry came from inside. It was just a whimper at first, then gradually turned into a sob, and after a while, it was full-blown crying. No one came in or out while she was crying. I always stood outside waiting. Until the crying subsided, and then came the sound of her footsteps and the sound of running water. She was washing her hands, face, and arranging her hair. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The moment the door opened, I saw the familiar Xiaoqin. The eye circles and nose are red, the hair is tied high, and the mood is full. She said: &quot;Let&#39;s add some instant noodles to the soup base.&quot; &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;/p>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;Editor-in-charge: Zhou Ziheng&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For information on the call for papers, see @ONE Studio’s top Weibo post.
