Are you making a living doing what you love? &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;There are not many people around me who make a living by engaging in the profession they love. The one who has a more profound memory is a high school mathematics teacher in his thirties who wears highly myopic glasses. He has an ordinary appearance but a temperament. Warm and peaceful. He is currently assisting Tibet. When chatting with him, his love for his career and his satisfaction with life can be revealed in every word. He often posts about his interactions with students in his circle of friends, and even takes Tibetan students through the mountains and rivers of Tibet. The photos fill the screen with the splendor of his world and the tranquility of the years. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;But there are very few people like this teacher who can combine work and hobbies. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Faced with this question, I think the answer for most people should be no. &lt;strong>;Most people make a living doing work that they neither like nor are good at that much, and the joy of life is also limited. Almost all come from outside work. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;2. Although you can’t make a living from your favorite career, it’s nice to be able to develop it into a side job, isn’t it? &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;My current job is foreign trade sales. My daily work involves endless meetings, endless PPTs to write, endless reports to make, and endless services to people with different cultures around the world. client. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;When I open my eyes every morning, the to-do list that comes to mind today is so overwhelming that I can’t even get up. &lt;strong>;But when I think that life requires material things, poetry and distant places require tickets, I can only force-feed myself some chicken soup, get up with difficulty, put on a professional mask, and start the day&#39;s work, silently looking forward to the arrival of the weekend in my heart. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I usually keep books in my hand, but I have always regarded reading as entertainment. I like reading, but I don’t seek to understand it deeply. Many people around me have advised me to consider output, thinking that chatting with me can bring them peace, which is what many impetuous and anxious workplace people need. I didn&#39;t pay much attention to it at first, but after seeing the living conditions of people around me who were making a living doing what they loved, I came up with the idea of ​​turning my hobby into a side job. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;3. Make sure this is your hobby and not a means to escape reality. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;When developing a hobby, you can actually ask yourself, are you developing it because of your love, or are you trying to escape reality because your current career is too unsatisfactory? &lt;strong>;If this is your passion, it can develop into a side job, but if it is just a way to escape reality, it will only make you sink deeper and deeper. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I believe that many people who like reading have encountered such questions from people around them: Stop reading those irrelevant books every day. If you read too much, you will lose touch with reality. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;They don’t seem to know that in addition to those romantic love novels, there are also many complex and dark realist works that reflect real life and depict human nature. Reading these works not only does not make me escape from reality, but actually Let me understand reality better, accept reality, and love reality. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;4. Do you really need to be prepared in all aspects before you start? &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The answer is no. There is a concept called MVP (Minimum Viable Product), which refers to developing a minimal prototype or version with basic functions in the shortest possible time. We put this new product into the market, then pay attention to collecting feedback from the market, and then continuously improve our products based on the feedback, so as to become more and more perfect. Therefore, &lt;strong>;we don’t need to prepare too much. Over-preparation will easily make us hesitate to move forward. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Don’t think too much, just start doing it. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;After I decided on my hobby and wanted to develop it into a side job, I began to explore ways to monetize my reading. I am really grateful to the development of self-media, which allowed me to quickly find many low-barrier and low-cost ways. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;There are many platforms for video output. I finally chose to try these platforms: Bilibili, Douyin, and Xiaohongshu. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;In the process of doing it, find a way that suits you. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Initially, I recorded some of my reading experiences and ways to relieve anxiety in the workplace into videos and posted them on Douyin, Bilibili and Xiaohongshu. The effect of the video on Douyin and Xiaohongshu was not very good, and the traffic was not high. However, it quickly gained some fans on Station B. I think it is probably due to the differences in the user groups of the several platforms, as well as the platform traffic. The different distribution methods lead to this result. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Because my energy is limited, I began to tilt my energy expenditure and focused more on the operation of station B. I began to analyze user needs and improve my output content. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;It is normal for the results of hard work to fluctuate. What we have to do is to persist, and persistence will pay off. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;In the beginning, after the video was released, I would turn on my phone almost every five minutes to check the data. If the data was good, I would be very happy, but if the data was bad, I would be very anxious. . After this situation lasted for a period of time, under my own adjustment, I slowly began to calm down and focus on how to improve. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;After persisting for about three months, I have received new books as gifts from some book editors one after another. I will select some good books and recommend them to fans; I have also received a lot of feedback from fans. &lt;strong>;Understanding I met many people who also love reading, and also came into contact with many interesting souls. My amateur life became richer and more interesting, and it opened the door to a new world for me. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;I really like what Mingyue said during the interview: &lt;strong>;&amp;ldquo;There is only one way for people to succeed, which is to follow Live your life the way you like. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong>;I believe it will be a good start to develop your hobby into a side job. &lt;/p>;&lt;/p>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>;Editor in charge: Zhou Ziheng onewenti@wufazhuce.com&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For information on the call for papers, please see the @ONE Studio pinned on Weibo.

Tang Xiaoman was born and raised in Shenzhen, but her family could only live in a rented house. When a loofah vine invaded her window and invaded her life, everything changed. &lt;/p>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;1&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;At half past six in the morning, it was green that woke her up. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Tang Xiaoman dreamed all night. From Futian Luohu to Longhua Guangming, I dream about the old and poor people I have lived in these years. The door frames have different degrees of rust, facing east and west, and the small advertisements are almost the same. The pipes are unblocked, the locks are opened with integrity, and the screens are made to order. A certain order is formed spontaneously, crookedly surrounding the cat&#39;s eye. The balcony is covered with long strips of color, sometimes clothes, sometimes flowers. She wanted to get closer, and the patch of green burst out. From the cracks in the window, under the rolled-up wallpaper, it came overwhelmingly, as if she was suddenly stuffed into a bottle of essential oil. The smell of menthol hit Tianling Gai, green and choking. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;She woke up immediately. When I opened my eyes, the room really turned green. It has a plastic texture and is unreasonably green, even darker than in the dream. She subconsciously looked towards the window, where the glass was covered by something. Not a whole piece, but many small green pieces, stacked together and shaking, as if they were alive. A burst of fire rushed up instantly. She jumped out of bed, ran out of the bedroom with disheveled hair, and bumped into her mother who was preparing breakfast. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Where are you going on the big weekend? &quot;The mother was holding the porcelain spoon for porridge. She was obviously frightened by Tang Xiaoman&#39;s appearance. A strand of porridge dripped on the floor without even noticing. Tang Xiaoman said angrily, &quot;Go find that wicked family.&quot; &amp;rdquo;As he said that, he walked towards the door again. The mother ran after her and grabbed her, stepping on the porridge with her plastic slippers, and asked, &quot;Who are you looking for?&quot; When she heard this, she became even more anxious and dragged her mother back to the bedroom. The white glutinous porridge dripped all over the floor, like a crack in the ice. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;It’s the one who grows loofahs! &amp;rdquo;Tang Xiaoman pointed to the green window. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Her family lives on the sixteenth floor. The high-rise apartments in Nanshan District, Shenzhen, dominate the world and have been enjoyed for a hundred years. They should not have anything to do with any local crops. But a month ago, a vine suddenly shot out. The stem is green, furry and curved, with two heart-shaped leaves sandwiched between it, dangling in front of her window. At first, she didn&#39;t pay much attention, thinking they were flowers planted by her father, Tang, roses or clematis, which just grew along the air-conditioning pipes. Over the years, Old Tang has been obsessed with gardening. The small balcony of four square meters is bustling with large and small pots. Money trees reach the roof, succulent pots are full, and there are more that she doesn&#39;t recognize. The flowers are as green as a color blindness test board. Every time my mother went to the balcony to dry clothes, the going in and out felt like a jungle adventure, and even the clothes smelled like grass after they were dried. But her mother let Old Tang do it, never complained, and told Tang Xiaoman not to talk too much. Okay, Tang Xiaoman thought, just let it dangle, she tolerated it. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Unexpectedly, that one vine quickly turned into two or three. The heart-shaped leaves are also spread out in multiples, and they are not polite at all, covering half of the window. Tang Xiaoman&#39;s bedroom was separated from the living room. The window was originally small, but being blocked in this way cut off most of the sunlight and vitality. She was unhappy and ran to argue with Old Tang, but Old Tang didn&#39;t say anything and just looked down at the balcony railing. She followed and took a look, oh my god, countless green vines were tangled and entangled, climbing up from the invisible bottom. Stacked, curled, swaying, the shiny leaves rustled in the wind, like a vertical green sea wave. It turns out that it was not done by Old Tang, but by foreign forces. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;This is not a flower, but what is it? &quot;At that time, Old Tang had already started to get sick. He scratched his head and couldn&#39;t find the words. His mother took a look and said, &quot;It&#39;s a loofah.&quot; &quot;Old Tang slapped his forehead and said, &quot;Yes, loofah.&quot; &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Tang Xiaoman was born in Shenzhen. The loofahs he saw were all on plates, in vegetable baskets, and in trash cans. He had never seen such undisciplined wild scenes. But what normal person would grow loofahs in a high-rise apartment? It also blocks the sunshine, which is worth an average of RMB 180,000. She became even more angry, picked up her father&#39;s gardening shears, and cut the vines clean with a few strokes. Unexpectedly, this seemingly limp crop turned out to have amazing vitality. Even though it was completely cut off, it climbed up again the next morning. Cut again, climb again. For the past month, Tang Xiaoman had been battling wits and courage with this loofah vine every day. From annihilation battles to positional battles, and then to protracted battles, there was still no victory or defeat. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Forget it, we are all neighbors, why bother about it. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;My mother was still holding the porcelain spoon, her face was a little swollen, and it was also reflected green by the window. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;No more. &amp;rdquo;The mother stopped mid-sentence and closed her mouth. But Tang Xiaoman knew the second half of the sentence that her mother swallowed back—besides, we are tenants, so why bother with the landlord? Long before those loofah vines, this sentence had appeared repeatedly in this small ninety-square-meter apartment, lingering like the moisture returning to the south. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Their family of three has been renting here for almost two years. Before this, Jin Maoyue in Futian was rented for a year and a half. The area was smaller. The family was crowded into a palm-sized space, and several bottles and cans were knocked over every time they turned around. Before that, it was in Longgang. I rented it for half a year. It was a big place, but the floor was low and there was no sunlight. My clothes never dried. Generally speaking, the area of ​​this house is sufficient and the location is convenient, especially since the landlord lives in Hong Kong all year round and does not take care of other trivial matters except collecting rent at the end of the year. As time passed, Tang Xiaoman had the illusion that this house belonged to them. The red house is locked in a drawer, and her parents complain about the property in the business group when they have nothing to do. She can no longer be secretive and easily join the conversation about home buying among her colleagues in Shenpiao. After all, he was born and raised in the &quot;Second Generation&quot;, but he still has no house and no registered permanent residence. This status is so embarrassing that if he talks about it, it will inevitably lead to a mime. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Tang Xiaoman was upset and didn&#39;t speak, and his mother didn&#39;t say a word either. It seemed like everyone was choked by this sticky green paste. The mother lowered her head and finally found the porridge on the floor, and turned around to get the rag. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Besides... we are moving out soon. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;She knelt half-wipe the floor, kept silent for a while, and finally uttered the second half of the sentence. But it was not what Tang Xiaoman thought. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The rag was moved back and forth over and over again, causing sparks to form on the floor. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Just last week, the landlord in Hong Kong called and said, sorry, the house has been listed and you should not move out within a month. I had been looking at houses at the agency these past few days, but now I forgot about it. She suddenly deflated, as if the sink had been unplugged, and suddenly the whole world surged up and flowed down the drain. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Where to live is a small matter, but think more about your dad. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;My mother finally stood up, with the rag balled up in her hand like a piece of fruit. &amp;ldquo;In the past few days, it has gotten worse again. &amp;rdquo;She pointed to her temple. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Old Tang is fifty-eight this year and has two years left before retirement. But since a year ago, my brain has not been functioning well. At first, he was just forgetful, often forgetting things, and taking the wrong path. Later, he gradually developed into forgetting words and sentences, and finally even having difficulty in daily communication. The doctor said it was Alzheimer&#39;s disease. Tang Xiaoman was anxious, &quot;You&#39;re not even sixty yet, why do you have Alzheimer&#39;s disease?&quot; The doctor tilted his head and typed the medical record and said, &quot;What&#39;s this? It&#39;s so normal. People are under a lot of stress these days. It&#39;s common in people in their twenties.&quot; &amp;rdquo;Tang Xiaoman stopped talking. She is almost thirty this year and seems to be a dangerous person. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Lao Tang has indeed been under a lot of pressure in recent years. The company collapsed and was re-established, the business declined and then declined, and all the money earned was eventually invested in the stock market. After more than 40 years in Shenzhen, I was getting further and further away from the red house. After finishing college in the north, Tang Xiaoman decided to return to Shenzhen, get admitted to a state-owned enterprise as a fresh graduate, and finally settled in the place where he had stayed all his life. Colleagues who passed the exam in the same batch were mostly graduate students. Knowing that she was a &quot;second-generation graduate student,&quot; they were all very envious and asked her how much rent she collected every month. She just smiled, trying to steady her voice and move the subject away. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Old Tang was still standing on the balcony with his neck tucked into his shoulders and his back hunched over as usual. Through the flowers and trees, the back is furry, like an old monkey. Tang Xiaoman came closer and called Dad in anger. Old Tang didn&#39;t respond, his eyelids were wrinkled, and when he touched them up and down, a lot of dust was shaken off, and the stars were floating in the sunlight. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;She wanted to say something more, but Old Tang suddenly shrugged forward, stood on tiptoes, grabbed the railing tightly with both hands, and made a gesture of turning over and stepping over. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Tang Xiaoman was so frightened that he jumped up and quickly reached out to pull it away. However, Old Tang stopped on his own and just looked down at the railing. He muttered and said something. Tang Xiaoman approached and asked, &quot;Dad, what did you say?&quot; &amp;rdquo;Old Tang did not reply, his eyes were fixedly staring down. &quot;Dad, what are you looking at?&quot; &amp;rdquo;Tang Xiaoman asked again. He still didn&#39;t respond, blinking like an old monkey, showing a desolation that humans couldn&#39;t understand. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Tang Xiaoman followed this gaze and looked down. She didn&#39;t encounter anyone, nor did she encounter the vines that suffocated her. They just landed on the apartment building opposite. There are windows of different colors, some are moving, some are still, some are empty, some are full. More often than not, the curtains are tightened, and the shadows jump on the color blocks, like a jittering mosaic on a low-quality screen. For some reason, she was also a little intoxicated. Something else beyond human comprehension took hold of her. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;She vaguely heard something. It was my father&#39;s whisper. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;It fell, it fell! &amp;rdquo;Tang Xiaoman heard his father say this. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;2&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Tang Xiaoman and Zhou Yang sat face to face. The newly opened Sichuan restaurant is decorated in an industrial style with dim ambient lighting. Zhou Yang ordered a large table of dishes, including Maoxuewang, boiled fish, couple&#39;s lung slices, white meat with garlic paste, steaming like an altar between the two of them. What was the sacrifice? Tang Xiaoman didn&#39;t know and didn&#39;t have time to think about it. She was still thinking about what happened in the morning, just picking up the rice and not moving her mouth. Zhou Yang raised his arm to pick up the vegetables. With a shake of his hand, a piece of hairy belly slipped out and fell back into the porcelain basin with a sizzle. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The red soup splashed with the firelight, and a drop splashed on the back of her hand. The scalp tightens along with the skin, and it feels like a hole has been burned. It was wrapped in something and fell deeply. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Ten years ago, her father did this and watched something fall from a high place. Not a hairy belly, but a living person. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The story of Old Tang is cliche. He left home at the age of eighteen, traveled from Sichuan to Shenzhen, met his mother from Chongqing, walked around the streets, got married, and gave birth to Tang Xiaoman in a staff dormitory in Pingshan. . Around 1995, entrepreneurship became a trend, and Old Tang was encouraged to leave the factory, and the family began to move between rental houses. In those years, Old Tang worked as a driver, contracted projects, ran an agency, and did renovations. His residence was constantly changing. In Tang Xiaoman&#39;s memory, she was always changing schools, making up classes, and saying goodbye to friends she had just met. My mother is always packing and unpacking, neatly packing the things from the previous home, stacking them in boxes, and placing them intact in the next home. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;For Tang Xiaoman, the word home is like a water stain, which is always splashed and splashed. It evaporates accidentally, sways and floats to the sky, is covered with dust and falls off again. Come down. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;When Tang Xiaoman entered the first year of high school, Old Tang partnered with others to set up a logistics company and finally made some money. The family of three moved into Yujing Mansion in Luohu. At that time, Yujing Mansion had just opened. It was in a good location and was inhabited by respectable and serious urban middle class people. On the day of the move, Old Tang borrowed a brand new pickup truck from his friend and ran up and down the road. The face was full of red light, like a moving volcano. Tang Xiaoman had never seen him look so free. Before or after this, he always looked different, standing on the balcony with his back turned, probably holding a cigarette in his mouth, with his eyelids drooped, looking at many invisible places towards her. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Tang Xiaoman was born in Shenzhen and grew up next to Metro Lines 1 and 4, but she always felt far away from this city. Only during that time, when she went to and from school every day, went to the Cultural Park with her parents after dinner, and swiped her owner&#39;s card to enter and exit the community, she was enveloped in a rare but real atmosphere, as if Shenzhen was sitting right next to her, smiling. , breathed out at her. If it hadn&#39;t been for the person who fell, this tone might still be there now. She often thought. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Tang Xiaoman still hasn’t figured out who that person is. She always remembers that summer evening when she licked the two-yuan matcha ice cream into the community. The downstairs was crowded with people, and the crowd was full of people on the back of their heads. Walking over, I saw Old Tang. Facing the two policemen, his face was as pale as a volcano covered with snow. Passers-by were whispering to each other. Tang Xiaoman listened for a long time before he figured out that it was a resident of the building opposite who jumped. Old Tang happened to see it from the balcony and immediately called the police. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The scene didn’t have time to process, Tang Xiaoman huddled outside the crowd, and caught a glimpse of red through his calves and shoe uppers. It clings to the concrete pavement, glowing with heat in the sunlight, like a dense swarm of red ants, still spreading in all directions. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;The man climbed over the railing and jumped down. He did not fall down at first and was caught by the awning below... I heard Old Tang talking to the police. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;He stood for a while holding on to the crack in the wall, as if he regretted it, and wanted to grab the water pipe on the side and climb up again. He probably didn&#39;t hold it firmly and fell down anyway. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;After staying in Shenzhen for so many years, Old Tang still had a Sichuan accent. Tang Xiaoman listened from a distance, as if listening to an ancient and sad drama. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The sun melted the ice cream, leaving it sticky and burned on my fingertips. There is a strange smell in the air. It was faintly green, with a fishy smell, like expired essential oil. Something she couldn&#39;t understand grabbed hold of her, and Tang Xiaoman turned around and ran away upstairs. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;After that day, Old Tang never mentioned that person again, but Tang Xiaoman could feel that something had been left behind. Old Tang returned to his old self, standing on the balcony with his back turned, a cigarette in his mouth, and looking forward with drooped eyelids. It was the same apartment building where someone fell. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Why did that person jump down? Does the father know him? There could be some kind of relationship between two people separated by a long stretch of void that she didn&#39;t understand. Tang Xiaoman couldn&#39;t understand. It was as if she couldn&#39;t figure out why her days were suddenly different after this seemingly unrelated accident. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Tang Xiaoman is not superstitious, but there are too many things in the world that she cannot figure out, so she can only try to find an answer for herself. For example, the person who fell off back then, the piece of loofah vine at home, or the piece of hairy belly that accidentally fell off in front of me. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Noticing that she was absent-minded, Zhou Yang asked her what she was thinking about. Tang Xiaoman said she didn&#39;t think anything of it and took her chopsticks to fish into the red soup. The hairy belly was picked up, and the red oil poured into the bowl, but I didn&#39;t know if it was the piece that had fallen off earlier. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;She met Zhou Yang six months ago at a summit forum led by the company. He was a representative of a large factory and sat next to her. The two chatted awkwardly and found a lot in common. For example, they are all &quot;second generation&quot;, their parents&#39; hometown is in Sichuan and Chongqing, and they all lived in Yujing Mansion in Luohu. However, Tang Xiaoman naturally didn&#39;t mention the matter of not having a house or a registered permanent residence. The two chatted about Yujing Mansion, the walkways, flower beds, and nearby pastry shops and tea restaurants. One of them was on the gourmet list, and there was always a queue day and night. &quot;Yes, yes,&quot; Zhou Yang said, &quot;Gui Ji, we have opened many branches. Let&#39;s go eat together when we have time.&quot; &amp;rdquo;&amp;ldquo;Okay, okay. ” she replied. In the past six months, they have eaten at Guiji branch many times. Zhou Yang ordered fried Gui Diao and frozen lemon tea, and she ordered roast duck rice and salted lemon seven. They were always the same. Sitting face to face, Zhou Yang seemed to have transformed back into the Shenzhen of ten years ago. With a smile, he shouted at her again. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Unlike her, Zhou Yang is a true &quot;Second Generation Deep&quot;. Dachang Jinling, whose parents are university professors majoring in communications, holds several patents and owns two houses in Shenzhen alone. After dating for half a year, Tang Xiaoman could not help but feel guilty as she kept secrets in her heart. Zhou Yang is very close to Shenzhen, but she is far away. Even when she was alone, with two naked bodies facing each other, shaking, intertwining, and colliding indiscriminately, she still felt that there was always a layer between them. Just like a string of abacus beads, three times and five times divided by two, they are fiddled with and then separated, making a continuous crackling sound, but they always seem to be apart. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The phone suddenly rang. Tang Xiaoman took a look and saw that he was a familiar real estate agent. She hesitated to answer. Zhou Yang&#39;s eyes drifted across the altar, carrying the pungent smell of red oil and Sichuan peppercorns, which made her break into a thin layer of sweat. She opened the screen anyway. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Beautiful girl, I recently got a house in Haoting Pearl, with 2 bedrooms, 1 living room and 1 bathroom. It has all the furniture and appliances and is close to Line 2. It meets your requirements very well. Are you interested in taking a look? &amp;rdquo;The other party’s voice was loud and he went straight to the topic. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Tang Xiaoman subconsciously leaned back, his back pressed against the back of the chair. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;It’s not very convenient now. &amp;rdquo;She tried to lower her voice as much as possible. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Nowadays, there are many tenants and few houses. The price is the same every day. There are several customers watching, so you have to rush early if you want to see the house, pretty girl. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Putting down the phone, Zhou Yang blinked and asked, &quot;Why do you want to buy a house?&quot; &amp;rdquo;It seems that it was not suppressed and the sound still leaked out. She replied somewhat casually, &quot;Well, I have lived in the current house for a long time and it is always a bit unsatisfactory. My parents want to buy another one.&quot; &quot;Zhou Yang smiled and said, &quot;I like living in old houses. The longer I stay, the more popular I become. Now we live in a townhouse in the new district, and we can’t get used to it. &quot;Tang Xiaoman didn&#39;t answer. He randomly picked up a piece of chopsticks and put it into his mouth. He bit a peppercorn with his back molars, and a tingling sensation spread in his mouth. Zhou Yang became interested and asked again, &quot;I think your current community is not bad. The location in Nanshan is so good, but now the new projects don&#39;t have that location.&quot; &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Tang Xiaoman was thinking about how to answer the call, but fortunately the waiter came over to serve the food. It&#39;s a white oil loofah, green and wet. It looks out of place on the flaming red altar. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Seeing that you have a bad appetite today, I ordered this specially for you. It should be light to nourish your stomach. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Tang Xiaoman was stunned. The vine suddenly appeared in front of me, without warning, like a ghost. The unknown anger surged up again. She put down her chopsticks, looked at the plate of white oil loofah and said, &quot;That&#39;s why.&quot; &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Which one? &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Luffa. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Luffa? &quot;For the first time, an expression of incomprehension appeared on Zhou Yang&#39;s face. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Tang Xiaoman talked about the loofah vine. Starting from when the first vine climbed up the window, all the worries that had been suppressed for more than a month came out. Zhou Yang listened, his expression changing from blank to curious, interjecting from time to time, why don&#39;t you go to the business group to send messages, why don&#39;t you go downstairs and go door to door to ask, but Tang Xiaoman prevaricated him. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;I will ask my dad when I get home. He is now semi-retired and grows vegetables in the yard every day. He has everything from eggplants and potatoes to maybe loofahs. He knows best how to remove weeds and roots. ” Zhou Yang said. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Tang Xiaoman hummed and suddenly thought of Old Tang. Carrying big and small pots, the balcony of the rental house turned into a jungle. But there are always many people in this city, clinging to the soil and roots, and truly having a vast world in the huge courtyard. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;When she was a child, she had seen such a world. Before elementary school, she followed Old Tang back to Sichuan, but she was so young that she didn&#39;t even remember it. My mother often talks about her hometown in Chongqing. Tang Xiaoman has never been there, but it stays in her mind. In the small village at the foot of the mountain, every household surrounds the top of the mountain and cultivates ridges of fields. In patches, peppers, moss, and long-leaf radish are planted. As the New Year approaches, the villagers set up wooden racks in the backyard and set up a simple smoking shed. They hang the freshly slaughtered pork and newly stuffed sausages, each one swaying in the white smoke. The knots shrink together with the meat, and sometimes one or two pieces fall off. mother said. There are many cats in the village, and there are also many weasels. There is always a pair of small claws holding the meat, shaking the body, and heading towards the mountain in the blink of an eye. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;3&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;It was almost noon, Tang Xiaoman walked out of the elevator, turned around the corridor, and walked into an east-facing door opening. The community that opened in 2013 is neither new nor old. The biggest advantage is that it is not far from where I live now. The layout and lighting of the house are okay, but the decoration is too sloppy. The furniture and electrical appliances were all yellow, and there was only a layer of putty on the walls. Water was still leaking in the corners, and there were blue-gray mildew spots. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The agent took Tang Xiaoman around a few times and said, &quot;Come on, is it pretty?&quot; &amp;rdquo;Tang Xiaoman has some difficulties. The rent is indeed hard to come by, but the hardware is indeed lower than expected. She followed the agent to look at four apartments all morning. The keys were inserted into different keyholes, and the color behind the doorway changed four times. She was in a trance, as if she had fallen into countless folds. It&#39;s just as cramped, damp, covered in mildew as there is no daylight. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Tang Xiaoman felt a little tight in his chest and went downstairs to the open space. Several retired men were sitting around the flower bed chatting. Cantonese is a sinuous and sonorous language, mixed with a few unfamiliar accents, coming from further north or further south. An old man said, &quot;It&#39;s just across the street from the community, in Chunxiao in the Pine Forest, and someone came to me first.&quot; &amp;rdquo;&amp;ldquo;What? &amp;rdquo;Another local man didn’t quite understand. &quot;Drop it!&quot; Come on. &amp;rdquo;The uncle raised his hand to draw a parabola. &amp;ldquo;It fell down! &amp;rdquo;He was anxious, so he simply used Mandarin. The other uncle finally realized, &quot;Did you jump off the building?&quot; &amp;rdquo;&amp;ldquo;It’s great! &amp;rdquo;The uncle nodded repeatedly. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Songlin Chunxiao is the community where Tang Xiaoman’s family lives. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;She trembled violently. Old Tang on the balcony, the man who fell ten years ago, the hairy belly that slipped into the red soup, and the suffocating green. Countless color blocks fell from high places, fragmented and coherent, light and heavy, and pounced on her, hitting her. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Without even saying hello to the agent, Tang Xiaoman ran out of the community and called an online taxi to drive home. Old Tang could no longer answer the phone, and his mother&#39;s phone calls were never answered. She felt like a plug had been pulled out of her body, and dreams and memories were flowing down her blood vessels, flowing and flowing, rushing into the dark tube that she could not see with the whole world. The phone vibrated violently, and she lowered her head nervously, but Zhou Yang&#39;s name appeared on the screen. Distraught, she pressed the phone. There were no cars on the road. The driver was driving very fast, and the prompts for taking orders kept coming and going, tirelessly announcing the location and whereabouts of other strangers in the city. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;At the gate of the community, she got off the car and rushed straight to the building where her family rented. There was no one around the dry lawn, except for a security guard riding an electric car passing by slowly, his teacup limping back and forth in the basket. Tang Xiaoman stopped him and asked hesitantly, &quot;Did anything fall just now?&quot; &amp;rdquo;The security guard looked up at her, as if examining a suspicious person. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;What will fall out of the sky? Why did someone pick up the money after I dropped it? &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The sun was pouring down at noon, the cement road was steaming and gray, everything was dull but correct. Nothing out of place. She raised her eyes to look higher on the floor. On the same gray outer wall, only the vines were squirming in the wind, dense as ghosts, as if the flesh had been cut open by a sharp knife, and green pus and blood flowed out of the wound. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The house is empty. The new house hasn&#39;t been found yet, but my mother has already started organizing it. Unused chair cushions, extra casseroles and dishes in the kitchen, and hardcover books collecting dust on the bookshelf were all piled into several large corrugated boxes, carefully wrapped in bubble wrap and old towels, and turned into a blur. s things. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Tang Xiaoman stood in the middle of the cardboard boxes, his whole person becoming blurry. It took her several minutes to remember that her mother had accompanied Old Tang to the hospital for a follow-up checkup this morning, and she probably hadn&#39;t come back yet. When she went out in the morning, her mother specifically told her that Tang&#39;s brain function continued to decline and the original medicine was not effective, so the doctor was considering changing the treatment plan. At that time, my mother still held the porcelain spoon, but she held an extra bowl and opened it. No more white glutinous porridge grains fell on the floor. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;She was surrounded by too many vague things, and Tang Xiaoman was in a trance. She walked to her bedroom. Green light brightened his eyes. It was still the same vines, densely packed all over the window sill, with no gaps exposed. But today is indeed different. Through the gap in the window, a yellow flower followed a vine and wrapped around the lamppost next to the desk. Looking straight at her, like a pair of hot eyes. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;With a thud, Tang Xiaoman heard the sound of something falling. The unknown anger surged up again. She took the gardening scissors and started cutting like crazy. Flowers and vines fell with a sound, sticky juice burned between the fingers, and the air was filled with that familiar smell. The green is so faint that it chokes people. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Without mother stopping me, another idea came to my mind. She wanted to find that house, find the source of these vines, and eliminate these ghosts at once! &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The vines started to appear on the eleventh floor and extended to their sixteenth floor. Luffa has a strong climbing ability and can grow upwards and downwards as long as there is sufficient sunlight. Any of the residents on the middle floors could be the culprit. This is the conclusion she came to through countless arguments. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Her face was red and her whole body was shaking. My cell phone kept buzzing in my jacket pocket, but I didn&#39;t care about it. Like an angry beast, Tang Xiaoman knocked on the door of the resident on the fifteenth floor. A middle-aged man stood at the door. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;Is this the loofah you grew at home? &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;What? &amp;rdquo;中年男子像是听到了外语。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;丝瓜，外面的丝瓜藤，是不是你家种的？ &amp;rdquo;唐小曼加重语气。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;什么乱七八糟的，不是！ &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;大门彭地一声被关上了。唐小曼没有放弃，再次咚咚咚把门敲开。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;你神经病吧！赶紧走，再不走我报警了！ &amp;rdquo;中年男人满是怒容。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;大门再次被关上。唐小曼沉了一口气，转身跑去楼下。工作日的中午，楼道寂静无声，无人回应。唐小曼直接下楼梯跑到十一楼，咚咚咚敲起门来。左边的门洞紧闭着，依旧没有反应。倒是右边的铁门自己开了，咧开一条缝，一个瘦小老人从门缝后面钻出来，眨着眼睛朝她看。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;唐小曼吓了一跳，懈了劲，怒气也消退一半。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;阿婆&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;你家里有种丝瓜吗？ &amp;rdquo;她努力让声音显得礼貌一些。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;老人满脸皱纹，嘴巴一张，面部肌肉上下扯动。说了好些话，唐小曼一句没听懂。相比之前那个更北或者更南的大爷，这口音似乎更偏西面。沙沙的，带着沙砾和朔风，比老家川渝更西的西方。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;她反复跟老人解释丝瓜。连说带比划，老人好像终于听懂了，转身进屋，不久，手里捧着一团东西出来了。绿油油的色块，长条状。唐小曼眼睛都亮了，正是一对湿漉漉的丝瓜。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;她什么也顾不上了，眼中闪着绿光，猛地冲进老婆婆家里。老人似乎一个人住。熟悉的户型结构，屋子收拾得干净规整，显出一种她不曾见过的空旷。她奔向阳台，厨房，客厅，横冲直撞，像野兽迷失在荒原。只是始终没有找到那片绿色。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;折回阳台，她扒着栏杆往外看，这才重新看见那片海潮般的藤蔓。紧紧攀爬在外墙上，竟避开了所有窗口，蠕动着逆风而上。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;但这鬼东西究竟来自哪里？她不知道。没人知道。好像整个世界都不在乎。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;越过高层的穿堂风，她望着藤蔓，藤蔓也在回望她。分不清谁的目光更加凶狠，更加怜悯或者悲伤。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;一双枯槁的手突然从背后拉住她。是那个老婆婆，整张瘪脸都拧起来，在快速说些什么。唐小曼回过神，这才发现自己紧紧扶着栏杆，整个上半身都往外仰着，好像要翻越过去。藤蔓仍在挑衅地望着她，风像刀子一样割着她的脸。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;她再次想起了十年前，父亲口中那个掉下去的人。翻过栏杆，被遮雨棚接住。扒着墙缝站着，后悔了，想再抓住边上的水管爬上去。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;那是个多么可怜的人啊。她想。明明想死，却又更想活。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;唐小曼捧着一对丝瓜回到十六楼。电梯口站着一个人，窸窸窣窣的，朝他们家的门探头探脑。竟然是周扬。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;看到她走过来，周扬睁大眼睛，好像见到什么野蛮的怪物。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;发疯似的私闯民宅，又在冷风里吹了许久，手里还捧着一对滴着水的丝瓜。唐小曼清楚自己现在的模样。她不想多作解释，只疲倦地说了一句，&amp;ldquo;你怎么来了。 &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;周扬仍旧忧心忡忡地看着她。 &amp;ldquo;给你打了一中午电话，你一直没接。 &amp;rdquo;唐小曼想起了刚才口袋里不停振动的手机，跟心跳一样躁动不安。周扬继续问，&amp;ldquo;小曼你究竟怎么了？家里都好吧，没出什么事吧？ &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;她掏出钥匙插进锁眼，搅动，推门。硕大的瓦楞纸箱仍堆在客厅里，到处都是一团团模糊的颜色。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;周扬站在门口，明显有些意外。唐小曼沉默片刻，感觉自己也被一团泡沫纸包了起来，一切声音和色块都在飞速远离。她捏着手里的丝瓜，转头对周扬说，&amp;ldquo;我要搬家了。 &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;周扬反应过来，&amp;ldquo;哦哦，这么快就买好房了&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;不是的。 &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;她不客气地打断。 &amp;ldquo;我们家，从来没买过深圳的房。 &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;身体里那个隐秘的塞子再次被拔掉了。她什么都没再说，只感觉声音和色块都在继续远离。指尖突然一阵黏腻。低头一看，原来是那对丝瓜，不知什么时候被她捏碎了。腔体肥嫩，糊成一团，嫩绿汁水顺着手背淌下来，滴滴答答淋了一地。裂缝还鲜嫩，还年轻，却在加速崩开。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;4&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;唐小曼又一次在绿色中醒来。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;难得昨晚没有做梦，她坐在床上，感觉到一股奇怪的暖意。被这样浸染许久，她仿佛也进化出了光合作用。绿莹莹的皮肤吸收阳光，电子传递，能量转换，制造出一些她不曾有过的有机物。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;抬眼望向窗户，藤蔓愈发稠密，还开出更多朵鲜艳黄花，直勾勾望向她。不知为什么，她没有动怒，甚至没有兴趣多看，只感觉索然无味。换好衣服走出卧室，母亲半蹲在地上打包，没有端起瓷勺或粥碗。这算是有所不同的一天吗。她不确定。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;瓦楞纸箱堆得更多了，连那些常用的锅铲和小电器都已经被小心整理好。连同那些最琐碎，最古老，最不复记忆的杂物一起，被包裹进泡沫纸里，一层一层，掖进纸箱褶皱之中。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;新房已经找好，就是隔壁小区的那一套。手续前两天都办完了，今天下午就搬过去。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;如同二十多年里的每次搬家，母亲低头打包，手里握着美工剪刀，一刀一刀剪断包装胶带。胶带唰地一声拉开，又嗖地一声剪断，屋里满是刺耳的摩擦声。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;去看看你爸吧，那一大堆花还不知道该怎么搬呢。 &amp;rdquo;母亲跟她说话，嗓音被胶带声盖住了，听不清情绪。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;前几周复查回来，老唐换上了药。进口多奈哌齐，几千块一个月，果然贵有贵的道理，这几天情况明显好多了。认得出妻女，也能磕磕巴巴地交流几句。唐小曼倒是松了一口气，只是母亲，似乎还是高兴不起来。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;唐小曼愣愣地走到阳台上。透过斑驳的花木，老唐还跟往常一样，老猴般弓着脊背，躲在郁郁葱葱的绿色里。不同的是，今天他没有盯着对面大楼发呆，而是蹲在阳台角落，团着身子在看什么东西。唐小曼走过去，喊了一声爸。老唐没有回应，但就像块半风化的太湖石，窸窸窣窣的，每个孔洞都发出微弱声响。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;唐小曼蹲下来，凑过脸去看。是个一个半大不小的陶制花盆，藏在几个大花盆后面，紧贴着墙壁。洞口黑黢黢的，十几根健壮的绿色藤蔓扭曲着伸出来，不知怎么的却没有往上长，而是拐了个弯往下，顺着栏杆底部缝隙窜了出去。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;唐小曼脑子嗡地一声炸开。她站起来，扒着栏杆朝下看。正是这十几根藤蔓，一路向下攀爬，仿佛一条垂落的瀑布，一直掉到十一楼的位置。在那几乎看不清边界的地方，心形叶子不停卷曲，层叠，摇曳，竟又像后悔了似的，再度紧挨着灰蒙蒙的外墙爬了上来。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;原来这片遮住她阳光和朝气的丝瓜藤，这片鬼魅般的绿色，竟来自父亲，来自她自己家。唐小曼惊诧得说不出话来。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;倒是一直沉默的老唐突然抬起头。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;原来，没掉下去！上来了，他又上来了！ &amp;rdquo;老唐激动地喊叫，紧紧抓住唐小曼的手。眼皮上下眨动，抖落许多灰尘。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;听到动静，母亲握着剪刀跑过来。唐小曼突然又想起周扬。那天最后，唐小曼送周扬下楼。默剧尴尬上演，电梯间限定。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;ldquo;对了，我问了我爸丝瓜的事。 &amp;rdquo;周扬突然没话找话。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;唐小曼一时没反应过来。周扬又继续说，&amp;ldquo;我爸正好在院子里种着丝瓜呢，他说丝瓜木质化程度低，找到根上的一截，一刀剪了就行。 &amp;rdquo;&amp;ldquo;哦。 &amp;rdquo;唐小曼说。他又说，&amp;ldquo;断了根，仍它攀得怎么远，没几天就全枯了。 &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;她又朝那盆里的藤蔓看了看。棱沟布满短绒毛，缠绕交叉，义无反顾地顺着栏杆缝隙钻下去，又在她看不见的地方重新爬上来。老唐扒着栏杆往下看，仍旧激动喊叫。母亲站在花木的阴影下，剪刀握在手里。唐小曼什么也没做，转身离开了阳台。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;锅碗都已经打包，搬家公司已经到楼下了，她搬起第一个瓦楞箱下楼。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;电梯在十一楼停了，上来一个瘦小老人。正是那个老婆婆。想起那天的疯狂，唐小曼有些窘迫，老婆婆见了她倒眉开眼笑，干瘪的嘴上下抖动，在说些什么。唐小曼用力听，等电梯到了底楼才终于听出来，是在说丝瓜，丝瓜。老婆婆笑眯眯的，从挎着的篮子里透出一根绿油油的东西，不由分说放在瓦楞纸箱顶上。唐小曼垂眼一看，果然，还是一根淋着水的丝瓜。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;圆柱形的瓜体肥厚细腻，瓜蒂粗糙，还带着一朵半开的黄花。唐小曼苦笑一声，避开丝瓜的目光，小心走出单元门。瓦楞纸箱沉在藤蔓般的掌纹里，丝瓜在顶上微微滚动，好像在书写着什么。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;正午阳光倾泄而下，水泥路面泛着热气。搬家公司的货车停在不远处。她迈腿走过去。突然，头顶飘来一片阴影。好像有什么东西正在向她靠近。空气中开始弥漫起那股薄荷脑味，唐小曼扭过脖子朝上看。一团黑黢黢，绿幽幽的东西正飞速掉了下来。她看不清是什么，只看到整个天空，整座深圳城，全都被遮住了。 &lt;/p>;&lt;/p>;
