&lt;p>;女士们、先生们，&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;朋友们，&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;很高兴能成为受邀出席APEC工商领导人峰会并发表讲话。多年前我曾到过旧金山，这座美丽的城市以开放、包容、创造力而闻名，给我留下了深刻的印象。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; 三十年前，冷战后人类的走向时代问题是摆在亚太领导人面前的世界问题、历史问题、时代问题。对此，他们顺应和平与发展的潮流，召开了首届APEC领导人非正式会议。会议。双方一致同意超越集团对抗、零和博弈的过时思维，深化地区经济合作与一体化，建设充满活力、和谐繁荣的亚太共同体。这一重大决策，使亚太发展和经济全球化驶入快车道，成为世界经济增长的动力源、全球发展的稳定之锚、国际合作的排头兵。这段非凡的亚太合作历程值得我们借鉴。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; ——开放包容是亚太合作的本质特征。我们地区的发展不是靠搞对立对抗、以邻为壑、围小院高墙，而是开放包容、优势互补。我们坚持开放的地区主义，共同制定茂物目标和布城愿景，推动贸易投资自由化便利化，促进地区经济一体化。过去30年，亚太地区平均关税从17%降至5%，对全球经济增长的贡献率达70%。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; ——共同发展是亚太合作的总目标。发展是我们地区永恒的追求。我们坚持以发展为中心，不断深化经济技术合作，增强发展中成员自主发展能力。我们共同制定了“APEC方针”我们本着自愿、协商一致、渐进原则，尊重所有成员的发展权。过去三十年来，亚太地区人均收入增长了四倍多，十亿人摆脱了贫困。这是对人类进步和全球可持续发展的重要贡献。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; ——求同存异是亚太合作的最佳实践。地区经济历史文化不同，发展阶段不同。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; 强行统一不会促进地区合作，反而会加剧地区合作。求同存异才是正确方向。 30年来，我们妥善应对亚洲和国际金融危机等重大挑战，保持了亚太经济发展势头。我们之所以能取得成功，是因为我们顺应了大势、胸怀大局，发挥了和而不同、团结互助的伙伴精神。这使我们能够将成员多元化转化为合作动力，优势互补，共同进步。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;女士们、先生们，&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;朋友们，&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;世界进入新的动荡变革时期。世界经济增长动力低迷。不稳定、不确定、不可预测因素增多。未来30年亚太合作将走向何方？这是摆在我们面前的新时代问题。正如中国古代学者所言：“根固则好，志向则成”。我们要牢记APEC创始使命，不忘历史赋予我们的使命，携手重启亚太合作。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; 《联合国宪章》的签署地旧金山，体现了各国人民对世界和平的崇高愿望。和平来之不易，发展任重道远。我们应该共同维护《联合国宪章》的宗旨和原则，遵循国与国关系的正确准则，通过对话、结伴而不是对抗、结盟，维护亚太繁荣稳定。亚太地区不能也不应该成为地缘政治博弈的舞台，更不应陷入新冷战和阵营对抗。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; 亚太繁荣发展的故事表明，发展是发展的动力。只有合作才有可能，不合作是最大的风险，脱钩、供应链中断不符合任何人的利益。我们要坚持开放的地区主义，坚定不移推进亚太自贸区建设。我们要尊重经济发展规律，各尽所能，加强经济互联互通，加强有关区域贸易协定和发展战略对接，建设合作共赢的开放型亚太经济&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; 面对新一轮科技革命和产业变革浪潮，我们要超越视野、抓住机遇、顺应潮流，推动向数字化、智能化、绿色化发展转型。我们要共同推动科技成果创新和市场化应用，推动数字经济和实体经济全面融合。我们要共同完善全球科技治理，通过创新支持绿色数字化转型和可持续发展，构建开放、公平、公正、非歧视的科技发展环境。&lt;/p>; &lt;十年前，我提出构建人类命运共同体。 APEC布城愿景明确提出了2040年亚太共同体的愿景，为亚太地区进一步合作指明了方向。近年来，针对世界各国的迫切需要，我提出了全球发展倡议（GDI）、全球安全倡议（GSI）和全球文明倡议（GCI）。旨在激励所有利益攸关方应对全球性挑战，促进共同发展，改善人类福祉。中国将与亚太各国一道，推动落实这些倡议，建设持久和平、普遍安全、共同繁荣、开放包容、清洁美丽的世界。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; 女士们、先生们，&lt; /p>; &lt;p>;朋友们，&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;今年以来，中国经济稳步复苏、稳中有进。其增速在世界主要经济体中名列前茅。高质量发展取得扎实成果。中国仍然是全球增长最强大的引擎，今年将贡献全球增长的三分之一。正如一些工商界领袖所言，中国已成为最佳投资目的地的代名词，“下一个中国”已成为“最佳投资目的地”的代名词。仍然是中国。我们诚邀世界各国工商界朋友来华投资兴业、深化发展。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; 中国具有社会主义市场经济体制、超大需求市场、全方位服务等独特优势。供给方面产业体系较为完善，人力资源方面拥有丰富的高素质劳动力和企业家。中国经济发展具有自生性、韧性、潜力。过去，中国化解风险、应对挑战，克服重重困难和障碍，取得历史性成就。当前，中国经济总体韧性强劲、潜力巨大、回旋余地大，长期向好。我们有信心、更有能力实现长期稳定增长，我们的发展将继续为世界提供新的增长动力和机遇。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; 中国致力于践行以实现创新、协调、绿色、开放、共享的新发展理念，追求高质量发展、高附加值、绿色经济增长。近年来，我国“新三化”出口快速增长。即新能源汽车、锂离子电池和光伏产品。全国温室气体自愿减排交易市场即将启动，这将创造巨大的绿色市场机会。中国将加快推进产业体系现代化，为各类企业共享发展成果提供更好的制度保障，培育新的增长动力、创造更大的发展空间。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我们将继续敞开大门，谋求发展。我们将坚定不移推进高水平开放，进一步扩大市场准入。中国宣布取消对制造业外商投资的一切限制措施。第六届中国国际进口博览会于近日举行，第二届全球数字贸易博览会将于本月下旬举办。这些举措都将扩大中国对外开放，为各国创造更多发展机会和利益。中国正在以高标准落实区域全面经济伙伴关系协定。积极对接《全面且先进的跨太平洋伙伴关系协定》和《数字经济伙伴关系协定》高标准经贸规则，推进两项协定加入进程，拓展面向全球的网络高标准自由贸易区建设。今年是我提出“一带一路”倡议10周年。上个月，中国主办第三届“一带一路”国际合作高峰论坛，达成458项成果。中国金融机构为“一带一路”项目设立了7800亿元人民币的融资窗口，中外企业达成了972亿美元的业务交易。这都将有助于高质量共建“一带一路”，为世界各国互联互通、发展繁荣提供强劲动力。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; 无论国际风云如何变化，中国坚定不移推动共建“一带一路”市场化、法治化、国际一流的营商环境不会改变。我们为外商提供平等、优质服务的政策不会改变。我们将继续完善外国投资者权益保护机制，进一步缩减外商投资负面清单，充分保障外国投资者国民待遇，继续加强知识产权保护。我们将努力破除创新要素流动壁垒，深化数字经济改革，促进数据依法自由有序流动。我们还将采取更多“暖心”措施完善外国人入境、居留政策，消除金融、医疗、电子支付等服务瓶颈等措施。这一切都是为了方便外国企业在华投资兴业。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; 我想强调的是，中国的现代化建设必然要求高质量发展，克服经济挑战，稳步前进。让14亿多中国人民过上更好的生活是我们坚定不移的目标。对于世界来说，这意味着更广阔的市场和前所未有的合作机遇。 It will also instill strong impetus in the global modernization endeavor.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Ladies and Gentlemen,&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Friends,&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The Asia-Pacific business community has always been courageous pioneers in Asia-Pacific cooperation and global development. I hope that you will make full use of your entrepreneurship, and contribute even more to building an open Asia-Pacific economy and boosting global economic development. I also hope to see an active part of the global business community in the Chinese modernization drive to benefit from the huge opportunities brought by China&amp;#39;s high-quality development!&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Thank you.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 18 Nov 2023 04:21:05 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[002XI&#39;S VISIT - Perspectives on Xi-Biden Summit]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://mobile.chinadaily.com.cn/cn/html5/2023-11/18/content_002_6557978ded50d203d2ca2d70.htm#002XI&#39;S VISIT]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>; Sourabh Gupta, senior fellow at the Washington-based Institute for China-America Studies&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The fact that it was not just at a conference center or a meeting hall, but at a very specific location where they were ensconced together, and they have that walk, reminded me frankly of President Xi when he came in 2013 for the Sunnylands meeting. And Sunnylands started a process in US-China relations which blossomed in the next two years in that Obama administration. This was the Sunnylands meeting in California in 2013 between Obama and President Xi.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; And then there were a lot of deliverables coming out in 2013, 2014 and 2015, including a state visit. However, despite the progress made, it is crucial to recognize that the competitive dynamic between the two countries will persist. Issues such as export controls, technology disputes and decoupling in terms of supply chains are expected to continue. As a result, the future relationship between the United States and China will likely be defined by a combination of cooperation and intense competition in the field of technology.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Yasheng Huang, professor in international management at the MIT Sloan School of Management&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; For the past 30 years, we took it for granted the geopolitical stability of relations (between the US and China). And that was not true in the last five years. These two sides must come to an agreement, and this comes with understanding, common understanding. I think that having an understanding is going to be good for both economies because you need geopolitical stability. The problem now is that the geopolitical situation is so unstable, so you need to stabilize. &amp;hellip; (President Joe Biden and President Xi Jinping) need to come up with an understanding of some basic, fundamental issues, also come to an understanding that if you don&amp;#39;t manage the relationship well, you can end up in a war, and I don&amp;#39;t think anybody wants that. So to me the summit is very important.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Dominic Piazza, graduate student in international relations at San Francisco State University&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; It&amp;#39;s no secret that relations between the United States and China have been tense. There is a competition between our two countries. Both America and China are quickly becoming the most important countries in the world. So I think it&amp;#39;s very important that we work together on a lot of the most important challenges. I&amp;#39;ve met many Chinese people while I&amp;#39;ve been here at the APEC meeting. They are all very friendly and very kind. It&amp;#39;s very easy to forget the tensions in the international politics between our countries. And I think this is a good thing because it shows that we can work together to address important global issues.

These measures make China one of the countries with the strictest regulation and control of drugs, he said.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Furthermore, China has been strictly controlling precursor chemicals and materials in line with international conventions and domestic laws, listing 38 types of controlled precursor chemicals, Chen added.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &amp;quot;Cooperation between the US and China on this matter is expected to significantly assist the US in controlling fentanyl and addressing related social problems,&amp;quot; he said.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Chen said the NNCC&amp;#39;s notice indicates that China has begun taking practical actions in drug control cooperation, as preventing the illegal circulation of narcotic and psychotropic drugs, and precursor chemicals must primarily involve efforts from relevant enterprises.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The notice also provides clear information to these enterprises on domestic and international policies and regulations, signaling China&amp;#39;s intention to strengthen efforts in preventing drug-related issues, he said.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;span>;yangzekun@chinadaily.com.cn&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 18 Nov 2023 04:21:05 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
