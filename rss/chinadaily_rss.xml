/>;&lt;p>;国际媒体中心APEC 2023 周日在美国旧金山开幕。今年亚太经济合作论坛经济领导人峰会会议将于本周晚些时候举行。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; 继去年出现了一些乐观迹象，例如高层和工作人员的增加等，北京和华盛顿正忙于本周在旧金山举行的一次重要双边会议。两国政府高层接触表明，中美关系在创历史新低后正在企稳。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; 这种进步的背后是在习近平主席领导下的中国进一步发展壮大。分析人士表示，这一做法的核心是习近平提出的对华三原则——中美关系——分析人士表示，和平共处、相互尊重、合作共赢。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; 上个月在北京会见由多数党领袖查克·舒默率领的美国参议院两党代表团时，习近平重申了三项原则，并表示“ “地球幅员辽阔，足以容纳中美各自发展和共同繁荣”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;中国人民大学国际关系学院教授刁大明表示，“ ”北京始终如一地践行习主席提出的三项原则，这是一个总体理念。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; “合作是唯一正确的道路，各方都有广泛的真诚愿望。美国社会希望两国能够通过履行这三项原则，朝着共同的目标前进，并获得更大的利益。”刁说。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;他补充说，近几个月来美国高官访华次数增多，也表明华盛顿正在努力培育更多合作亮点，更好地稳定中美关系。&lt; /p>; &lt;p>; 中国国家主席始终积极倡导两国各层级交往，包括官方交往和公共外交。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; 过去几个月，习近平与美国会面国务卿布林肯、加州州长纽瑟姆等联邦和州官员，以及美国前国务卿基辛格等为中美关系做出杰出贡献的知名人士。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;布林肯表示，美国致力于负责任地处理与中国的关系，因为“这符合美国的利益，符合中国的利益，也符合世界的利益”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p >; 习近平还多次向关注双边友谊的组织、个人或活动致函或致函，例如本月在江苏省苏州市举行的第五届中美友好城市会议。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;双方交往中，突出有四个重点，着眼于改善中美关系、营造良好氛围。 “中美关系的基础在人民，希望在人民，未来在青年，活力在地方。”他说。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;他的努力和言论引起了两国各界的积极响应。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;美中青年学生交流协会创始人兼会长庄大卫7 月份，他与华盛顿州的友好人士共同签署了一封信，中国国家主席在 8 月份对此进行了回复。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; 庄告诉《中国日报》，他们向习近平发送了这封联名信，因为他们是受到习主席六月会见比尔·盖茨以及习主席“中美关系的基础在人民、希望在人民”的讲话的启发。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“我们想让习主席知道，美国有很多人期待着这份友谊能够传承下去，”他补充道。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; 除了习近平的个人推动之外，最近两国关系出现稳定迹象的另一个关键推动力是，中国近年来一直在坚定地抵消华盛顿的战略和冲动，以推动中美关系的发展。观察人士称，遏制和打压中国，促使其最近采取措施帮助缓和紧张局势。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“通过最近与北京的互动，华盛顿目睹了中国为维护自身主权而采取的坚决态度、安全和发展利益，中国对美国的挑衅行为进行了强有力的反击。”中国国际问题研究所副所长苏晓晖说&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; “因此，美国不得不重新考虑如何处理中美关系。”它对即将举行的总统会议的高度关注也是对美国国内和美国盟友要求修复与中国关系的呼声的回应。” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; 观察人士表示，双方应全面落实一年前两国元首在印尼巴厘岛达成的重要共识，华盛顿应有效遏制国内针对中国的负面因素。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; p>; &lt;p>; &lt;b>;“任重而道远”&lt;/b>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;中国驻美国大使谢锋周四在今年的香港论坛上发表视频讲话时表示中美关系认为“稳定和改善双边关系还有很长的路要走”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; 他强调，要回归巴厘岛共识、走向旧金山，还需要付出更多努力营造良好氛围，取得积极成果，采取扎实后续行动。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; 一位不愿透露姓名的美国国家安全委员会高级官员周五表示，即将举行的双边会议的目标是管理竞争、防止&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; “中国不怕竞争，但反对用竞争来定义（整体）中美关系，”外交部发言人毛宁周一对此作出回应。毛泽东在北京举行的例行新闻发布会上表示，美国不应“在损害中国利益的同时凸显自己的关切”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; 她表示希望美国兑现自己的承诺。不谋求“新冷战”无意与中方发生冲突，共同推动两国关系回到健康稳定发展的轨道。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;span>;zhangyunbi@chinadaily.com.cn&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;

权威专家表示，中国应考虑制定2024年GDP增​​长5%以上的积极目标，使经济增长回到潜在水平，稳定市场预期，进一步稳定就业市场。&lt;/他们表示，为了实现这一目标，财政扩张至关重要，辅之以宽松的货币举措，并补充说，如果需要的话，2024 年赤字与 GDP 之比超过 3% 应该是可以接受的。&lt;/p >; &lt;p>; 中国社科院院士余永定在接受《中国日报》专访时表示，国家有必要把明年的GDP增长目标定得超过今年&amp; #39;的增长，只要通胀保持低迷。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; “假设中国经济今年增长 5%，2024 年的目标肯定会超过 5%，”于说，制定积极主动的增长目标，可以调动各方面的活力，促进经济发展。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; 上半年GDP同比增长5.2%受惠于内需回升，国际货币基金组织预测前三季度全年经济增速为5.4%。然而，国际货币基金组织警告称，由于房地产市场疲软和外部需求疲弱，2024 年经济增长可能放缓。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; 人们的注意力集中在通常于 12 月中旬举行的年度中央经济工作会议上。将为2024年宏观经济政策定下基调。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; 此举被视为表明政策制定者的决心。为了强调为 2024 年的稳健增长铺平道路，中国最高立法机构于 10 月下旬批准额外发行价值 1 万亿元人民币（1,371 亿美元）的国债，使今年的赤字与 GDP 之比达到约3.8%。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; 于说，为了实现经济增长目标，如有必要，将明年的赤字率设定在3%以上是明智的，并强调扩张性财政政策是对于将增长稳定在与国家潜在增长率相符的水平至关重要。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; 潜在增长率是指一个经济体在不引发通货膨胀的情况下可以增长的最高可能增长率，同时运行在&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; 中国人民银行货币政策委员会原委员于宇补充说，货币政策可以发挥补充作用，比如通过措施抵消因增发国债而导致的利率上升。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; 随着国债发行速度加快，央行周一表示，国家增量社会融资总额——实体经济融资总额—— 10月份人民币国际收支1.85万亿元，同比多增9108亿元。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; 央行行长潘功胜上周在座谈会上表示，央行将综合运用多种工具，合理保值流动性充裕，降低实体经济面临的融资成本，同时保持融资成本总体稳定。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; 国家统计局原副局长李晓超表示，明年适当设定#39; GDP 增长目标为 5.5%。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; “需要更快的增长来稳定企业和家庭的预期，”李说，他们将目前低迷的情绪归因于近年来经济增长放缓，导致企业盈利和家庭收入增长不温不火。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; 在中国社会科学院发表的一篇文章中，城市与竞争力中心主任李指出，预计明年将有约1187万名大学生毕业，创历史新高。他补充说，这也使得有必要加快经济增长，从而创造更多就业机会。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; 不过，其他一些专家则更为谨慎，认为目标是 5% 左右，与此相同。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; 北京福斯特经济咨询首席经济学家冯健林表示，预计中国明年的GDP增长目标定在5%左右，房地产业、制造业投资、基础设施投资等方面得到大量政策支持。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;span>;zhoulanxv@chinadaily.com.cn&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;从年轻学生到老年人，他们都渴望参观这座于 2007 年开业、以吸引世界各地顶尖艺术家而闻名的标志性场馆。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; 在贵宾室里，90 岁的朱欣仁，检查了墙上挂着的在国家大剧院演出过的音乐家的照片。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; 那天一早起床，穿上一套漂亮的西装，朱德热切地盼望着见到一位五十年未见的老朋友。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; 察觉到人群涌入房间，朱转身微笑。他伸出手，与白发的戴维德·布斯握手，布斯说：“这是一次令人难以置信的会议。很高兴认识你。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; 朱回复：“我也很高兴。” 50 年过去了，我现在 90 岁了。”布斯说：“我 73 岁了。你看起来棒极了。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; 1973 年，在尤金·奥曼迪（Eugene Ormandy，1899-1985）的指导下，费城交响乐团成为美国第一支乐团自 1949 年中华人民共和国成立以来，乐团曾多次来华演出。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; 自那次访问以来，乐团已回国 12 次，在中国各地建立了深厚而有影响力的联系。音乐会和驻场演出促进了人文交流。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; 布斯 1973 年 23 岁，是乐团最年轻的小提琴手。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; 他不应该这样做那年他参加了中国巡演，但他接到电话，告诉他需要他来代替一位无法成行的音乐家。布斯既震惊又兴奋。他当时甚至没有护照。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; 在巡演期间，费城交响乐团与中国国家交响乐团（前身为中央爱乐协会）的音乐家们会面并合作。朱是华乐团的第一小提琴手。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; 在他们重聚时，布斯告诉朱，“我们可以演奏巴赫的双曲，”指的是巴赫的 D 小调两把小提琴协奏曲。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; “不，我现在不能演奏。我拉了40年小提琴，后来在管理组工作，但我已经很长时间没有拉小提琴了。”朱回答道。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; 布斯说：“不，我相信你可以，”并补充说，这是他在费城交响乐团担任小提琴手的第 51 年。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;b>;分享的回忆&lt;/b>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; 两人分享了他们一起排练的回忆。北京，其中包括在指挥家李德伦（1917-2001）和奥曼迪的指挥下演奏贝多芬的第五交响曲。他们一致认为这些排练“就像昨天一样”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;布斯说：“它（与朱的会面）让我起鸡皮疙瘩。这是最伟大的事情。长期以来，我们与人们建立了关系，建立了友谊。这绝对是我中国之行的一大亮点。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; 简短的会面后，他们走到了国家大剧院音乐厅，中国交响乐团和费城交响乐团的音乐家们正在那里排练音乐会。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; 布斯拿出小提琴，坐在舞台上两个乐团的音乐家中间，而朱坐在最后一排座位上，静静地观看。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; 音乐家们表演贝多芬的《第五交响曲》、伯恩斯坦的《老实人》序曲，以及作曲家华彦军的《二泉映月》等中国作品。这部由吴祖强编曲的作品也在1973年费城交响乐团中国巡演期间演奏。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; 该乐曲由中国国家交响乐团首席指挥李新草指挥。 ，以及今年6月被任命为费城交响乐团助理指挥的美国特里斯坦·赖斯-谢尔曼。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; 9月，美国交响乐团在庆祝其在华首场音乐会50周年之际宣布，13乐团成员计划前往中国进行驻场活动以纪念这一时刻。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;布斯是最新巡演中唯一一位参加乐团 1973 年访华的成员。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; 费城交响乐团总裁兼首席执行官马蒂亚斯·塔尔诺波尔斯基 (Matias Tarnopolsky) 表示：“音乐具有沟通和搭建桥梁的力量。我们很高兴能够纪念乐团历史性的 1973 年巡演，以及我们在这次驻地期间与中国人民建立的 50 年关系。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; “1973 年巡演至今仍被许多中国人铭记。作为深厚音乐友谊的象征，我们希望我们的音乐创作能够继续在我们两国人民和文化之间架起桥梁。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; 周五在国家大剧院举行的音乐会前举行了一个特别的仪式，由中国文化和旅游部主办，中国对外演艺集团承办。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; 塔尔诺波尔斯基向中国国家交响乐团演奏贝多芬第五交响曲全谱，塔尔诺波尔斯基说这是感激的象征。赖斯-谢尔曼还向李心草赠送了指挥棒。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; “1973年北京交响乐团见面时，中国中央乐团向费城交响乐团赠送了一份精美的礼物——指挥棒”。一种中国打击乐器”塔尔诺波尔斯基说道。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; “当时我们的音乐总监奥曼迪在收到这份礼物后演奏了贝多芬的第五交响曲。 50年后的今天，我们谨以这份乐谱作为回报，表达我们的谢意。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; 中国国家交响乐团为美国乐团献上了中国经典作品《颂》的全谱。吕启明作曲的《红旗》，以及中国钢琴协奏曲《黄河》黑胶唱片。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; 塔尔诺波尔斯基表示：“看到两国音乐家并肩演奏，真是令人兴奋。”我们是团结的，音乐确实是一种通用语言。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;b>;巡演日程&lt;/b>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;正在进行的中国巡演于周四开始，预计将于周六结束后，费城交响乐团将访问天津、上海和江苏苏州。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; 上周六，费城交响乐团在天津茱莉亚学院进行了演出，该校的音乐家——天津交响乐团乐团和天津音乐学院。周五，乐团将在上海科技大学举办大师班、小组讨论和室内乐表演。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; 今年年初，费城交响乐团与 iSING! 合作！苏州国际青年艺术家节将呈现世界各地青年作曲家新作中的古唐诗（618-907）。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; 在周五的音乐会上，乐团还演奏了相关作品的选曲&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; 莱斯-谢尔曼说：“这是我第一次访问中国。我正在逐渐了解这个国家，尤其是当我准备并演奏以唐诗为基础的音乐作品时。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; 一年后，美国乐团于 1973 年进行了具有里程碑意义的中国巡演。时任美国总统理查德·尼克松访问了该国。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; 费城交响乐团被认为是尼克松的自然选择，尼克松在前一年的周年纪念音乐会上获得了殊荣。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; 奥曼迪也被认为是尼克松的自然选择。认为合适，因为他30年前曾在澳大利亚举办过中国赈灾音乐会，并在1940年抗日战争期间（1931-45年）参加过为中国卫生工作者筹款的慈善音乐会。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; 10 月 30 日，中国国家交响乐团在北京举办了一场沙龙，邀请了朱和前小提琴手、88 岁的杨石，后者曾于 1973 年与费城交响乐团合作。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当时，美国和中国之间没有直飞航班。乐团在檀香山过夜，然后飞往东京，最后抵达北京。乐团在中国首都民族文化宫举办了四场音乐会，音乐家们参观了长城、颐和园和故宫等景点。他们还观看了芭蕾舞剧《白毛女》。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; “以前从未有过这样的情况，所以听到乐团要来中国的消息后，我们都非常兴奋，”朱说。 “我们是第一批加入乐团的音乐家，但我们的技术不如现在的年轻音乐家。不过，我们都做好了充分的准备，希望能发挥出最好的水平。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; “在与指挥家李德伦的一次排练中，我们为美国客人演奏了贝多芬第五交响曲的第一乐章。随后李请奥曼迪指挥，几小节后，我们一起演奏得非常好。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; 奥曼迪后来请中央爱乐乐团演奏一首中国作品，李指挥了《二号映月》春天。奥曼迪对这些音乐印象深刻，因此要求提供一份乐谱。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; 费城交响乐团 1973 年访问中国的照片捕捉到了费城交响乐团的音乐家在首都向人群展示如何玩飞盘的照片。 .&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; “乐团的来访成为头条新闻。这不仅是一次音乐交流，更是美国音乐家与中国人民之间的交流。” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;b>;协奏曲演出&lt;/b>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;美国乐团1973年在北京演出后，又在上海举办了两场音乐会。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当年9月22日，乐团结束中国巡演返回美国。在下一个演出季中，奥曼迪指挥乐团和钢琴家丹尼尔·爱泼斯坦录制了《黄河》，成为第一支录制中国钢琴协奏曲的美国乐团。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; 周四，费城交响乐团在亚特兰大举办了一场小型音乐会。在北京钓鱼台国宾馆，四位音乐家与中国童声合唱团一起演奏了中美作品。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; 小提琴家布斯说：“令我感动的一件事是年轻人和老年人一起玩耍……这不断建立在两国共同的伟大基础和伟大音乐遗产的基础上。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; 他还对中国令人兴奋的古典音乐界感到惊讶，尤其是中国的年轻音乐家，他们“ “为全世界的音乐做出了贡献”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; “中国产生了伟大的独奏家，如郎朗和王羽佳，他们都是超级巨星，”他说。 “我们费城交响乐团中有不少中国演奏家。当然，他们是我们的家人，这也让中国成为我们的家人。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; “音乐是将人民和国家紧密地联系在一起的东西。”这些年来，我们确实看到了古典音乐在中国不断增长的粉丝群体。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; 回顾这些年，布斯说：“我们意识到有多少人被我们的古典音乐深深感动。 1973 年举行第一场音乐会。那次巡演是我们人生中的一个关键时刻，至今仍然如此。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; 他还将国际知名作曲家谭盾称为“非常生动的案例”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; 1973年，谭在湖南，费城交响乐团的音乐会在他工作的田地里转播演奏。他很感动，想把自己的一生都奉献给音乐。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; 布斯说：“谭已经成为世界级的巨星，但他仍然谈到我们在中国的第一场演唱会对他的影响。” ”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; 9月，当费城交响乐团与音乐和艺术总监 Nezet-Seguin 在美国北卡罗来纳州巡演时，布斯在一场音乐会上收到一条消息，说有人想和他说话。 &lt;/p>;

&lt;p>; On Friday afternoon, the National Centre for the Performing Arts in Beijing, or NCPA, was bustling with visitors as usual.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Ranging in age from young students to seniors, they were eager to see the iconic venue, which opened in 2007, and is known for attracting top artists from around the world.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In a VIP room, Zhu Xinren, 90 , inspected photographs of musicians who have performed at the NCPA, which were hanging from the walls.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Rising early that morning to don a smart suit, Zhu was eagerly anticipating meeting an old friend he had not seen for 50 years.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Sensing crowds entering the room, Zhu turned around and smiled. Reaching out, he shook the hand of gray-haired Davyd Booth, who said: &amp;quot;This is an incredible meeting. I am so happy to meet you.&amp;quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Zhu replied: &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m happy, too. It&amp;#39;s been 50 years, and I&amp;#39;m now 90 years old.&amp;quot; Booth said: &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m 73.You look great.&amp;quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In 1973, under the direction of Eugene Ormandy (1899-1985), the Philadelphia Orchestra became the first orchestra from the United States to perform in China since the founding of the People&amp;#39;s Republic of China in 1949.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Since that visit, the orchestra has returned 12 times, developing deep, impactful connections throughout China as a result of concerts and residencies that led to people-to-people exchanges.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Booth, who was 23 in 1973, was the orchestra&amp;#39;s youngest violinist.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; He was not supposed to join the China tour that year, but he received a phone call telling him he was needed as a replacement for a musician who could not make the trip. Booth was both shocked and thrilled. He did not even have a passport at the time.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; During the tour, the Philadelphia Orchestra met and worked with musicians from the China National Symphony Orchestra, formerly known as the Central Philharmonic Society. Zhu was the Chinese orchestra&amp;#39;s first violinist.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; At their reunion, Booth told Zhu, &amp;quot;We can play Bach&amp;#39;s Double,&amp;quot; referring to Bach&amp;#39;s Concerto for Two Violins in D Minor.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &amp;quot;No, I cannot play now. I played as a violinist for 40 years and later worked in the managing group, but I have not played the violin for a very long time,&amp;quot; Zhu replied.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Booth said, &amp;quot;No, I&amp;#39;m sure you can,&amp;quot; adding that it was his 51st year playing as a violinist with the Philadelphia Orchestra.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;b>;Memories shared&lt;/b>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The pair shared memories of the rehearsals they had together in Beijing, which included playing Beethoven&amp;#39;s Fifth Symphony under the baton of conductors Li Delun (1917-2001) and Ormandy. They agreed that these rehearsals seemed &amp;quot;just like yesterday&amp;quot;.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Booth said: &amp;quot;It (the meeting with Zhu) gave me goose bumps. This is the greatest thing. We have built relationships, we have built friendships with people for such a long time. This is definitely a highlight of my trip to China.&amp;quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; After their short meeting, they walked to the NCPA concert hall, where musicians from the China National Symphony Orchestra and the Philadelphia Orchestra were rehearsing for a concert that night.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Booth took out his violin and sat among the musicians from both orchestras on the stage, while Zhu sat in the last row of seats, watching quietly.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The musicians performed Beethoven&amp;#39;s Fifth Symphony, Leonard Bernstein&amp;#39;s Overture to Candide, and Chinese works such as The Moon Reflected on the Erquan Spring by composer Hua Yanjun. This work, arranged by Wu Zuqiang, was also played during the Philadelphia Orchestra&amp;#39;s China tour in 1973.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The music was played under the batons of Li Xincao, chief conductor of the China National Symphony Orchestra, and Tristan Rais-Sherman from the US, who was named assistant conductor of the Philadelphia Orchestra in June.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In September, the US orchestra announced on the anniversary of its first concert in China 50 years ago that 13 of its members planned to travel to China for residency activities to mark the occasion.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Booth is the only member of the latest tour who joined the orchestra&amp;#39;s visit to China in 1973.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Matias Tarnopolsky, president and CEO of the Philadelphia Orchestra, said: &amp;quot;Music has the power to connect and build bridges. We are delighted to commemorate the orchestra&amp;#39;s historic 1973 tour and our 50-year relationship with the people of China during this residency.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &amp;quot;The 1973 tour is remembered to this day by many in China as a symbol of deep musical friendship, and we hope that our music-making will continue to build bridges between our people and cultures.&amp;quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; A special ceremony took place before the concert at the NCPA on Friday, which was hosted by China&amp;#39;s Ministry of Culture and Tourism and organized by China Arts and Entertainment Group.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Tarnopolsky presented a complete score of Beethoven&amp;#39;s Fifth Symphony to the China National Symphony Orchestra, which Tarnopolsky said was a symbol of gratitude. Rais-Sherman also presented Li Xincao with a baton.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &amp;quot;During their meeting in Beijing in 1973, the Central Philharmonic Society of China presented a beautiful gift to the Philadelphia Orchestra &amp;mdash; a Chinese percussion instrument,&amp;quot; Tarnopolsky said.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &amp;quot;Ormandy, our music director at the time, played Beethoven&amp;#39;s Fifth Symphony after receiving that gift. Now, 50 years on, we would like to express our gratitude and give you this score in return.&amp;quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The China National Symphony Orchestra gave the US ensemble a complete score of the classic Chinese work Ode to the Red Flag composed by Lyu Qiming, and a vinyl disc of the Chinese piano concerto The Yellow River.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Tarnopolsky said: &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s exciting to see musicians from the two countries playing side by side. We are unified, and music is truly a universal language.&amp;quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;b>;Tour schedule&lt;/b>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; During the ongoing China tour, which started on Thursday and is due to end on Saturday, the Philadelphia Orchestra will visit Tianjin, Shanghai and Suzhou, Jiangsu province.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Last Saturday, the orchestra gave a performance at the Tianjin Juilliard School, which featured musicians from that school, the Tianjin Symphony Orchestra and Tianjin Conservatory of Music. On Friday, the orchestra is due to give master classes, panel discussions and a chamber performance at ShanghaiTech University.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Early this year, the Philadelphia Orchestra partnered with the iSING! Suzhou International Young Artists Festival to present ancient Tang Dynasty (618-907) poems set to new works by young composers from around the world.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; During the concert on Friday, the orchestra also performed selections from those works related to Tang Dynasty poems, such as Drink to Me by Li Bai and Upon the Crane Tower by Wang Zhihuan.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Rais-Sherman said: &amp;quot;This is my first visit to China. I am getting to know about this country, especially when I prepare and perform works of music based on Tang Dynasty poems.&amp;quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The US orchestra&amp;#39;s landmark tour of China in 1973 came a year after then-US president Richard Nixon visited the country.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The Philadelphia Orchestra was considered a natural choice for Nixon, who had been honored at its anniversary concert the previous year.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Ormandy was also considered suitable, as he had conducted a China Relief concert in Australia 30 years before, and took part in charity concerts to raise money for Chinese health workers in 1940 during the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression (1931-45).&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; On Oct 30, the China National Symphony Orchestra launched a salon in Beijing, featuring Zhu and its former violinist, 88-year-old Yang Shi, who played in 1973 with the Philadelphia Orchestra.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; At that time, there were no direct flights between the US and China. The orchestra spent a night in Honolulu, then flew to Tokyo, before finally arriving in Beijing. It played four concerts at the Cultural Palace of Nationalities in the Chinese capital, and the musicians visited scenic spots, including the Great Wall, the Summer Palace and the Forbidden City. They also watched the ballet The White Haired Girl.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &amp;quot;This had never happened before, so we were all very excited after hearing the news that the orchestra was coming to China,&amp;quot; Zhu said. &amp;quot;We were the first group of musicians with the orchestra, but our skills were not so good as those of young musicians today. However, we all prepared fully in the hope of performing to our best.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &amp;quot;During one rehearsal with conductor Li Delun, we played the first movement of Beethoven&amp;#39;s Fifth Symphony for the American visitors. Li then asked Ormandy to conduct, and after a few bars, we played very well together.&amp;quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Ormandy later asked the Central Philharmonic Society to play a Chinese work, and Li conducted The Moon Reflected on the Second Spring. Ormandy was so impressed by the music that he asked for a score of it.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; A photograph of the Philadelphia Orchestra&amp;#39;s visit to China in 1973 captures its musicians showing crowds in the capital how to play Frisbee.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &amp;quot;The orchestra&amp;#39;s visit made headlines. It was not only a musical exchange, but also communication between the American musicians and the Chinese people,&amp;quot; Zhu said.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;b>;Concerto performed&lt;/b>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; After performing in Beijing in 1973, the US orchestra gave two concerts in Shanghai.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; On Sept 22 that year, after ending its tour of China, the orchestra returned to the US. In its next performance season, Ormandy conducted the orchestra and pianist Daniel Epstein in recording The Yellow River, becoming the first US orchestra to record a Chinese piano concerto.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; On Thursday, the Philadelphia Orchestra gave a small concert at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse in Beijing, in which four of its musicians performed Chinese and US works with a Chinese children&amp;#39;s choir.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Booth, the violinist, said: &amp;quot;One thing that touched me was that young people were playing alongside older people &amp;hellip; this constantly builds upon the great foundation and great musical heritage that both countries share.&amp;quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; He is also amazed by the exciting classical music scene in China, especially the nation&amp;#39;s young musicians, who &amp;quot;have contributed to music throughout the whole world&amp;quot;.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &amp;quot;China has produced great soloists, such as Lang Lang and Yuja Wang, who are superstars,&amp;quot;他说。 &amp;quot;We have quite a few Chinese players in the Philadelphia Orchestra. Of course, they are family to us, which makes China family to us.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &amp;quot;Music is something that strongly brings people and countries together. Over the years, we have definitely seen the fan base for classical music to grow in China.&amp;quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Looking back over the years, Booth said: &amp;quot;We realized just how many people were deeply touched by our first concerts in 1973. That tour was a pivotal moment in our lives, and remains so to this day.&amp;quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; He also referred to the internationally acclaimed composer Tan Dun as a &amp;quot;very vivid case&amp;quot;.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In 1973, Tan was in Hunan province, when concerts performed by the Philadelphia Orchestra were transmitted and played over the fields in which he was working. He was so moved that he wanted to devote his life to music.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Booth said, &amp;quot;Tan has since become a worldwide superstar, but he still talks about the influence that our first concerts in China had on him.&amp;quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In September, when the Philadelphia Orchestra toured North Carolina in the US with Nezet-Seguin, its music and artistic director, Booth received a message during a concert saying that someone wanted to speak to him.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; It turned out to be a Chinese family. The man and his wife had been to one of the orchestra&amp;#39;s concerts in China in 1973. They were extremely touched by the performance, and were now living in North Carolina.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &amp;quot;They wanted to touch base with somebody who was there. That was really an incredible personal moment that showed me the influence that those concerts and our trips to China over the years have had on people everywhere,&amp;quot; Booth said.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;span>;chennan@chinadaily.com.cn&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 14 Nov 2023 05:21:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[003XI&#39;S VISIT - Chamber eyes stable Sino-US ties]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://mobile.chinadaily.com.cn/cn/html5/2023-11/14/content_003_65528f24ed50d203d2ca27e1.htm#003XI&#39;S VISIT]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>; Members of the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai are looking forward to the China-US summit and the APEC Economic Leaders&amp;#39; Meeting because a stable and healthy relationship between the two nations is extremely important for the development of enterprises, especially US companies in China.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &amp;quot;We can develop well in China in the long term only if the two countries have a relatively stable relationship,&amp;quot; said Eric Zheng, president of the trade body.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The APEC Economic Leaders&amp;#39; Week has commenced in San Francisco in the United States and runs through Friday.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Zheng said that despite challenges, US companies see China as a very important and strategic market &amp;mdash; a market to which they hope to continue having access and in which they want to succeed in the long term. &amp;quot;We are in China for China, and we are not going away.&amp;quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; China remains the world&amp;#39;s second-largest economy as the country&amp;#39;s GDP surpassed 121 trillion yuan ($17 trillion) in 2022.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Given the colossal size of the Chinese market, even 5 percent growth can re-create another Switzerland in terms of GDP, Zheng said.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &amp;quot;For us, a 121-trillion yuan economy is a huge market that nobody else can replace,&amp;quot; he said.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The CIIE offers a great platform for US companies to reach agreements, and more than 200 US enterprises showcased their products at the expo this year, he told China Daily during an interview on the sidelines of the event.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; For the first time, the US Department of Agriculture and the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai jointly set up the US food and agriculture pavilion at the world&amp;#39;s first import-themed national exhibition.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; A total of 17 exhibitors showcased their products at the pavilion, including meat, almond, cheese and wine as well as health supplements.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; During his visits to US corporations attending the CIIE, Zheng said he received positive feedback and the companies recognized the event as a great platform to showcase their products in the China market.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai was very pleased to see the active participation of US companies in the CIIE this year, Zheng said.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; He added that the trade body will plan details of its participation in the expo next year. &amp;quot;Our ultimate goal is to assist US companies, especially those enterprises that have huge interest in the China market but are not able to come here and take part in the China market.&amp;quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;span>;wang_ying@chinadaily.com.cn&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 14 Nov 2023 05:21:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[003XI&#39;S VISIT - More US students expected to study in China]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://mobile.chinadaily.com.cn/cn/html5/2023-11/14/content_003_65528f26ed50d203d2ca27e2.htm#003XI&#39;S VISIT]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://mobile.chinadaily.com.cn/cn/resfile/2023-11-14/003/20231114_003_02_33035.png&quot; />;&lt;p>;A US student who studies at Soochow University learns to make mooncakes with primary school children in Suzhou, Jiangsu province.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The number of students from the United States heading to China to study is likely to increase in the years to come due to their sustained interest in the country, a US State Department official said, as both Washington and Beijing agreed to ramp up people-to-people exchanges.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &amp;quot;We know there is continued interest of American students in learning about China, we are confident that interest will continue,&amp;quot; Marianne Craven, acting deputy assistant secretary for academic program at the US State Department&amp;#39;s Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs, told China Daily on Thursday.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The official made the remarks at a media briefing for the launch of the Open Doors 2023 Report on International Educational Exchange, that was released by the bureau and the Institute of International Education on Monday.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In 2021-22, the number of US students studying abroad for academic credit totaled 188,753. Three quarters of the students chose to study in Europe, and only 4.7 percent, or 8,892 students, headed to Asia, according to the report.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; During the same period, there were 211 US students pursuing academic credit on the Chinese mainland, the lowest number in a decade.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The situation has caught the attention of US Ambassador to China Nicholas Burns, who has called for bringing more US students to China.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; After a recent meeting with Wesleyan University President Michael Roth, who was in Beijing and Shanghai to recruit prospective students and meet alumni members, Burns wrote on social media on Oct 26: &amp;quot;We discussed the importance of (US) universities, students, scholars returning to (China). There are currently only roughly 350 American students in China, compared to more than 11,500 in 2019.&amp;quot; Those numbers do not match the figures in some research conducted in China.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In an online discussion with the Stimson Center on May 2, Burns confided that his &amp;quot;only personal goal&amp;quot; was to learn Mandarin, and he encouraged more US students to do so.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &amp;quot;Despite the fact that our administration has really focused on the competitive aspects in large measure in our relationship, we do want to see students travel back and forth; we ought to want to see young Americans learning Mandarin, learning the culture and history of this country,&amp;quot; he said.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; At Thursday&amp;#39;s briefing, Craven revisited the ambassador&amp;#39;s remarks, saying, &amp;quot;We certainly concur.&amp;quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Mirka Martel, head of research, evaluation and learning at IIE, said the COVID-19 pandemic had affected the number of US students studying in China.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &amp;quot;But we do note that as travel restrictions have lifted and as travel is again available, that we likely may see that US students will continue to go to China for their study abroad experiences,&amp;quot; Mirka said.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; She said that the interest of the US students in pursuing studies in China &amp;quot;has been there in the past&amp;quot;.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &amp;quot;This is quite different from the numbers we had before the pandemic. Before the pandemic, we had robust numbers of US students studying in China,&amp;quot; she said.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; For example, in the 2016-17 academic year, close to 12,000 students were in China and nearly 15,000 US students were there back in 2011-12.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &amp;quot;That interest is not going to go away,&amp;quot; Allan Goodman, chief executive officer of IIE, said.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; With tensions between China and the US showing signs of easing in recent months following a series of high-level engagements, more government support for studying abroad in each other&amp;#39;s country can be expected.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; During their meeting late last month in Washington, DC, Foreign Minister Wang Yi and US Secretary of State Antony Blinken reiterated the importance of ties between the two peoples, and both sides welcomed strengthening people-to-people exchanges between students, scholars and businesses, including working to increase the number of direct flights between the two countries, an official readout said.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; China, with 289,526 students studying in the US, remained the leading place of origin for international students in the US in the 2022-23 academic year, accounting for 27.4 percent of the total number of international students, according to the Open Doors report.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; It said the number of students coming from China has fallen in the last three years predominantly due to the COVID-19 pandemic.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Overall, the US hosted more than 1 million international students during the 2022-23 academic year, a 12 percent increase compared with the previous academic year, the fastest growth rate in more than 40 years, according to the Open Doors report.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; It said the number of international students who enrolled for the first time in a US college or university during the 2022-23 academic year increased by 14 percent year-on-year to 298,523, building on the 80 percent increase in the prior year.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; International students accounted for 6 percent of the total US higher education population and contributed nearly $38 billion to the US economy, according to the US Department of Commerce.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;span>;huanxinzhao@chinadailyusa.com&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 14 Nov 2023 05:21:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[003XI&#39;S VISIT - San Francisco puts best foot forward for APEC]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://mobile.chinadaily.com.cn/cn/html5/2023-11/14/content_003_65528f29ed50d203d2ca27e3.htm#003XI&#39;S VISIT]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://mobile.chinadaily.com.cn/cn/resfile/2023-11-14/003/20231114_003_03_67035.png&quot; />;&lt;p>;Mingmei Li&lt;/p>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://mobile.chinadaily.com.cn/cn/resfile/2023-11-14/003/20231114_003_03_50035.png&quot; />;&lt;p>;A pedestrian walks along 4th Street in San Francisco on Saturday, ahead of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting in the city.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; With the &amp;quot;APEC is going to be EPIC&amp;quot; banners displayed prominently throughout San Francisco, the city has been made ready for the 30th Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Leaders&amp;#39; Week, which began on Saturday and runs through Friday. The slogan reflects not only the city&amp;#39;s warm welcome to its guests, but also signifies its commitment to transformation and renewal.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The forum, which has gathered leaders and entrepreneurs from 21 member economies, offers more than a prime opportunity for dialogue on multilateral cooperation and the exchange of ideas on vital subjects such as the economy, trade, technology, climate change and other significant international issues. The city and its people are also eager to promote their locale and extend their hospitality, showcasing the best of what San Francisco has to offer.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; With security measures heightened to guarantee the safety of the event, residents of San Francisco said they are experiencing traffic delays and congestion, resulting from road closures and traffic control implemented for the forum.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &amp;quot;We are a little bit stressed out during the week, but there will be an equal amount of feeling excitement that we are living in an international city,&amp;quot; San Francisco resident Charlie Barratt said. These small inconveniences are understandable, he said, adding that he believes that the government will maintain its current efforts even after the forum.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &amp;quot;San Francisco is usually pretty show-off-able at all times, so I&amp;#39;m not concerned about it going back. Tourism is one of the top three industries here, so we are prepared for lots of visitors coming here for all kinds of reasons,&amp;quot; Barratt said.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; He expressed his hope that these positive changes would attract, in addition to those attending the APEC event, more international visitors, as the city experienced a decline in tourism post-pandemic due to previously unresolved social issues such as homelessness and rampant drug problems.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; John Quackenbush, another San Francisco resident, said: &amp;quot;The world leaders are coming to the most beautiful city in the world. We need to get San Francisco back on track. The government is putting a lot of effort into making the city&amp;#39;s lives better.&amp;quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; San Francisco is recognized as the fourth-largest metropolitan area in the United States in economic terms, and it plays a crucial role in the global economy, boasting a GDP of $501 billion.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The Bay Area also hosts numerous Fortune 500 companies and is headquarters for pioneering enterprises in sectors such as artificial intelligence, biotechnology, clean energy and social media.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Paired with the West Coast vibe, clean streets lined with palm trees, the tranquil waters of the Pacific Ocean, the lazy seals lounging on Pier 39, the sea gulls fluttering about seeking snacks from tourists, the pink and purple hues of the sunset sky, and the safe and leisurely strolls on the streets in the early hours after the city&amp;#39;s nightlife has simmered down &amp;mdash; these visual elements and atmosphere are reemerging, aligning perfectly with the aspirations and present reality of the city during the APEC meeting.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; To comply with the theme of APEC, such positive changes in the city need to be sustainable.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &amp;quot;I hope that when (APEC participants) leave, we maintain our housekeeping. It makes us feel good, and it makes us feel proud,&amp;quot; said San Francisco resident Amelia Hurtado. &amp;quot;We&amp;#39;d love to have (tourists) see the real US the way we used to have it.&amp;quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 14 Nov 2023 05:21:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[003XI&#39;S VISIT - US agricultural representatives call for stronger trade relations with China]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://mobile.chinadaily.com.cn/cn/html5/2023-11/14/content_003_65528f2ced50d203d2ca27e4.htm#003XI&#39;S VISIT]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://mobile.chinadaily.com.cn/cn/resfile/2023-11-14/003/20231114_003_04_93035.png&quot; />; &lt;p>; Agricultural representatives from the United States have called for stronger trade relations with China and voiced their opposition to politicization of the food sector.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Jim Sutter, CEO of the US Soybean Export Council, said that big countries such as China and the US are bound to have differences at the high level. &amp;quot;But at the agricultural level, we want to make sure we have a strong working relationship,&amp;quot; he said in an interview on the sidelines of the sixth China International Import Expo, which concluded in Shanghai on Friday.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The US Department of Agriculture led 17 exhibitors &amp;mdash; ranging from food-processing firms to exporters and packaging companies &amp;mdash; to attend the six-day expo.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Jason Hafemeister, acting deputy undersecretary for trade and foreign agricultural affairs in the US Department of Agriculture, told China Central Television in a recent interview that Sino-US agricultural partnership dates back to the 1970s and has been mutually beneficial. &amp;quot;They (the two countries) should continue to reap the benefits of such engagements,&amp;quot; he said.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The global agricultural sector is beset with major challenges such as food insecurity and practices that are environmentally less sustainable, according to Hafemeister. &amp;quot;How do we grow food in a way that protects the planet and doesn&amp;#39;t add to the climate change (crisis)?&amp;quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Agricultural exchanges between the two countries and the resulting progress in these areas can help set a path for other countries to follow, which could benefit the whole planet, he said.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The calls for stronger agricultural trade and research ties came amid ideological disputes and geopolitical tensions between the world&amp;#39;s top two economies. Such differences have expanded and affected agricultural collaboration in recent years.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Last month, authorities in Arkansas ordered Syngenta Seeds to divest its ownership of farmland in the US state, after China National Chemical Corporation acquired 80.7 percent of the company&amp;#39;s shares in 2017.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Speaking last month at the US-China Sustainable Agricultural Trade Forum and Contract Signing Ceremony in Des Moines, Iowa, Chinese Ambassador to the US Xie Feng called the decision discriminatory and unfair.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Xie said there are still serious difficulties and challenges in Sino-US relations. &amp;quot;To deepen agricultural cooperation, we need to say no to attempts to politicize economic issues or overstretch the concept of security,&amp;quot; he said.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; China has emerged as one of the largest food importers thanks to globalization over the past two decades. The country&amp;#39;s agricultural export volume is now 5.3 times the level in 2001, when the country joined the World Trade Organization, Chinese media reported.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Meanwhile, the volume of Chinese food imports is almost 14 times its 2001 level, and China is also the primary destination for agricultural products from the US.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Xie said at the Iowa forum that bilateral agricultural trade exceeded $50 billion last year. SinoGrain, China&amp;#39;s State-owned importer, reportedly purchased 600,000 metric tons of soybean from its US supplier on Nov 7. This was the largest single-day soybean purchase by the world&amp;#39;s top soybean importer since late July.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &amp;quot;China-US agricultural cooperation features complementarity and mutual benefit,&amp;quot;他说。 &amp;quot;China is the world&amp;#39;s largest importer of agricultural products, while the US is the largest exporter.&amp;quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Despite the differences, industry insiders participating in the forum spoke highly of China&amp;#39;s achievements in agricultural development and its huge contribution to global food security.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; They emphasized that US-China agricultural cooperation is beneficial to both countries and the world, and expressed their readiness to make every effort to expand friendly exchanges and practical cooperation between the two sides.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Chairman of the US Grains Council Brent Boydston said the US grain industry supports free trade and wishes to overcome the challenges in bilateral relations and continue working with Chinese partners for win-win results.&lt;/p>;

/>; &lt;p>; China is seeing the circulation of multiple infectious respiratory illnesses this winter, with surging cases of mycoplasma pneumonia, rising cases of influenza flu, but a downward trend in COVID-19 cases in recent days, health authorities and experts said on Monday.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; They added that people can recover from most respiratory infections without special treatment, but the elderly, children aged 5 and under and immunocompromised groups should visit hospitals promptly and take therapies as guided.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Mi Feng, spokesman of the National Health Commission, said during a news conference that as winter approaches, China has entered the peak season for respiratory illnesses, and different viruses or pathogens are circulating simultaneously.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &amp;quot;Efforts should be made to monitor the spread of mycoplasma pneumonia, COVID-19, influenza flu, as well as dengue fever and norovirus infections, to step up surveillance and early warnings so as to understand the spread of these viruses and their mutations,&amp;quot; he said.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Mycoplasma pneumoniae &amp;mdash; a pathogen that commonly causes sore throat, fatigue, fever and a lingering cough that can last for months in children aged 5 and above &amp;mdash; has drawn heightened attention this winter as hospitals nationwide have seen young patients swarming there to seek treatment.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Tong Zhaohui, vice-president of Beijing Chaoyang Hospital affiliated to Capital Medical University and head of the Beijing respiratory disease research institute, said that regional epidemics of mycoplasma pneumoniae infections emerge every three to seven years.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The pathogen tends to spread quickly among kindergartens, schools and family members, he added.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &amp;quot;This year, the disease also inflicts children aged under three, but their condition is not more severe compared to previous years,&amp;quot; Tong said.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; At his hospital, Tong said, the positivity rate for the pathogen stands around 5.6 percent for adults and 40.3 percent among children.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; He added that the increasing activities of the pathogen and other viruses are not unexpected.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &amp;quot;During the COVID-19 pandemic, the spread of acute respiratory diseases appeared to be mild due to strict personal protection measures,&amp;quot; he said.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &amp;quot;With the ease of virus containment measures, the circulation of these diseases has returned to pre-pandemic status, which is normal.&amp;quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Wang Dayan, director of the China National Influenza Center administered by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said that flu activities across the nation have been rising, with H3N2 the dominant strain.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In past years, the flu season for winter and spring usually runs from about mid-October to early March and peaks in January, she said.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Wang stressed that an effective way to prevent flu infections and reduce related serious cases and deaths is expanding vaccinations. Arrangements have been rolled out to facilitate flu immunization among medical workers, the elderly, people with chronic diseases, staff members at nursery and elderly care centers, schools, as well as children aged from six months to five and family members of infants.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; She added that flu vaccine supplies this year have risen compared with last year and are sufficient to meet demand.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Regarding COVID-19, Wang said that the number of domestic cases has been on a downward trend since late August and the positivity rate of the disease at fever clinics and hospitals is declining consistently.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; China reported 209 severe COVID-19 cases and 24 related deaths in October, according to the China CDC.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; However, Zhong Nanshan, a prominent respiratory illness expert, said during a conference on Friday that modeling shows that small spikes of COVID-19 infections will likely appear this month through to January.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Zhong suggested the public, especially vulnerable groups, obtain updated vaccines as soon as possible.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;span>;wangxiaoyu@chinadaily.com.cn&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;获取更多RSS：&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 14 Nov 2023 05:21:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[004CHINA - Next-gen internet accelerates data flow]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://mobile.chinadaily.com.cn/cn/html5/2023-11/14/content_004_65528f32ed50d203d2ca27e6.htm#004CHINA]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>; China has launched the world&amp;#39;s first ultra high-speed next-generation internet backbone, with a transfer rate of bandwidth reaching 1,200 gigabits per second (1.2T), marking a milestone in global internet infrastructure, experts said on Monday at a news conference at Tsinghua University in Beijing.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The backbone is a high-speed data transmission line that can provide network facilities to internet service providers.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Jointly developed by Tsinghua University, China Mobile, Huawei and The China Education and Research Network, the ultra high-speed internet backbone covers more than 3,000 kilometers linking Beijing, Wuhan in Hubei province and Guangzhou in Guangdong province.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Professor Wu Jianping, head of the Institute for Network Sciences and Cyberspace at Tsinghua University, said the backbone is an essential experiment result of the national Future Internet Technology Infrastructure project.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The 1.2T backbone network is capable of transferring 150 high-definition movies in just 1 second, exhibiting a transmission efficiency more than 10 times that of the current 100G network.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; It&amp;#39;s built on key core technologies developed independently in China, including the 1.2T ultra high-speed IPv6 interface in the next-generation internet core router.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The backbone achieves complete domestic production and independent control of both software and hardware components, positioning its overall technological capability at the forefront globally.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; It has been running trials since July 31 and has seen stable operation, Wu said.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; It was estimated that the transfer of bandwidth would reach this speed around 2025, but Chinese computer scientists accomplished the goal earlier, promoting the development of global internet infrastructure, he added.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Professor Xu Mingwei, executive dean of the institute, compared the ultra high-speed next-generation internet backbone to a high-speed railway.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &amp;quot;The speed has increased from 60 kilometers per hour for an old train to 300 km/h for a high-speed one. Previously, it required 10 railways to accommodate the crowded passengers, but now, one high-speed railway is enough. We can expand the bandwidth to meet the demand of larger user traffic by building a 1.2T internet backbone,&amp;quot; Xu said.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The main contributor to this technological achievement is that one ultra high-speed internet backbone played the role of 10 normal ones before, with lower construction and management costs, he said.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;span>;zhaoyimeng@chinadaily.com.cn&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 14 Nov 2023 05:21:04 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
