“我希望在不久的将来，我们可以尝试在我们村种植水稻，让当地人从种植中获得更多利益。” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; 5月15日至19日，Piewmeu参加了在昆明为村长举办的培训班。他们了解了现代农业种植技术、中医药发展、中国脱贫攻坚经验、旅游医疗振兴乡村举措等。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; 出访第一站位于昆明市呈贡区的云南民族大学澜沧江-湄公河国际职业学院。来访者参加了该校产业融合专业副教授尹晓英的两小时课程。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; 除了老挝人民的友善，他们对经济的渴望和热情给尹晓英留下了深刻的印象。尹说：“据我了解，这些村长来自中国边境地区。”老挝，特别是边境口岸附近的国家，提出来云南学习交流。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; “令我惊讶的是，他们在课上和课后都很热情。”会议期间，大家踊跃提问，积极参与。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; 尹总向来访者介绍了云南大理白族自治州漾濞彝族自治县核桃产业发展情况。他们还了解了该省如何完善农业领域的工业、生产和经营体系。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; 该县以核桃生产而闻名，位于苍山东部苍山的光明村。漾濞，核桃树随处可见，最古老的已有1165年的历史。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; 当地农民靠种植核桃为生，但2017年，核桃的价格突然暴跌了10元（每 500 克 1.4 美元。村民们卖不出好价钱，核桃加工工厂也陷入困境。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; 为了应对低迷的市场，核桃种植者考虑成立村合作社来管理和销售他们的核桃。生产更加有序，希望提高农作物的价格和质量。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; 尹还从2017年开始进行为期五年的实地考察，观察影响该村经济的因素帮助当地人民摆脱贫困的发展和方法。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; “我看到他们使核桃的生产方式多样化。村民成立了多家合作社，引进无烟烤箱烤核桃，拓展流通渠道，建立电商平台进行网上销售。” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; “从种植到制造，生产的核桃得到充分利用，村里还推出了一批特色民宿，带动乡村旅游。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在昆明给老挝村长讲课时，尹向他们讲述了光明如何脱贫。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; “由于光明县经济规模较小，目前还在探索一些农产品的深加工，目前还没有成熟的方案。”实现规模化经营。然而，由于依托风景秀丽的苍山，当地旅游业正在蓬勃发展。” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; 她补充说，老挝人想更多地了解这些进展，以及光明是如何实现较快的经济增长的，因为他们自己的村庄也面临着类似的情况。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt; b>;交通四通八达&lt;/b>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;老挝只有省、市、村三个行政级别。老挝每个村庄都有一名村长，其行政权力仅次于村长——类似于中国的区县长。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; 由于城市化率较低，老挝大部分人仍然生活在农村地区。村长是政府和人民之间的桥梁，在该国农村地区，居民往往与村长关系密切。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Seng Xaiyavong，44 岁，Ban Borpied 村村长，该村距离与中国北部边境口岸磨丁约8公里，村里有696人，其中大部分人白天在磨丁工作。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; 其中两名村民在磨丁车站工作。乘坐这条铁路来昆明考察的村长之一赛亚冯说，这条铁路距离他们的村庄只有约1公里。这是Xaiyavong第一次出国旅行。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; “我是来学习的，学到了很多东西。尤其令我印象深刻的是安宁古浪村乡村旅游产业的蓬勃发展，天然温泉带动了当地经济的发展，带动了相关文化旅游设施的发展。” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Xaiyavong表示，发展农业产业需要大量资金和资源，往往超出个人能力范围。 “老挝的农村工业发展与中国不同。我们还有很大的改进空间，” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; 2021年12月中老铁路开通，促进了两国贸易往来，为老挝发展注入新动能。 2020 年，经济复苏受到了 COVID-19 大流行的严重影响。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; 尽管在中老铁路开通之前，老挝与泰国边境沿线有一条较短的铁路线，但许多老挝人认为后者村长Piewmeu说：“我们村的人靠种植和割胶树为生，因为当地没有支柱产业。几年前，我们只能低价将橡胶卖给当地工厂。随着铁路开通，越来越多的中国企业主购买我们的橡胶，产品价格上涨。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;他说，前往老挝首都万象，通常需要两天时间乘坐巴士&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; “铁路开通后，到万象的旅行时间缩短到了四个小时，” Piewmeu说，并补充说，现在村民们选择外出务工，而不是留在家里务农。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; 除了交通便利之外，老挝人的生活条件也很不错。收入提高了。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; “以前我们靠自然条件谋生，却很少思考如何提高生活水平。”皮尤姆说道。 “铁路将我们与外界联系起来，让中国商人来到了我们村。他们看到了机会，我就尝试向他们推荐当地的项目，为村民提供更多的就业机会。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;b>;经验分享&lt;/b>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; 与企业主的沟通昆明之行进一步坚定了老挝村长助推发展的信心。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;安宁云南如然乐土农业开发有限公司总经理齐明德表示，来访者最感兴趣的是中国企业家作为投资者如何短短两年时间，帮助村民年收入从18000元提高到23000元。他们也想知道，为什么企业家们会做出如此大胆的决定，在农村进行如此大规模的投资。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; “为了过上更好的生活，村长们不禁思考：跳出框框并进行实验，以测试他们从我们发展乡村生态旅游的经验中获得的知识。” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; 他说，五年来，他的公司把当地农民变成了股东，让他们参与决策，充分利用当地资源。该村30名富余劳动力全部就业，去年当地居民月均收入达到3000元左右。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;齐说，为改善村里环境，区垃圾堆高的地方被清理干净，变成了绿化区。居民们的改造了房屋，修建了环村步行道，提高了全民健身水平。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; “我们发展乡村旅游的古浪村，村民年人均收入从五年前的1.8万元上升到了1.8万元。” 23000元。我们的旅游项目二期已经竣工，三期将继续扩大经营规模。” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; 在边境考察中，齐先生看到老挝自然资源丰富。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; “老挝是发展生态旅游的好地方。”具体方法村长们可能不知道，但老挝宜人的环境可以用来改善旅游资源。” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; “很多老挝村长表示，希望将我们公司在古浪取得的成功复制到自己的村庄。”他们还计划派更多的村民和有关部门的官员来中国向我们学习。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; “我毫不犹豫地与老挝人民分享我们的经验，我非常愿意帮助老挝人民的发展老挝农村地区。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; 老挝人也对云南农村公司使用的农业种植技术印象深刻。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Ban Borpied 村长 Xaiyavong 表示，希望农业种植技术能够在老挝得到推广。昆明的专家和技术人员很快就会来到他的村庄，指导居民用更先进的技术生产植物产品。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; “我们种植橡胶、甘蔗和西瓜。我们的大部分产品通过云南销往中国其他地区。云南丰富的特色农作物品种、规模化的种植模式、成熟的购销体系给我留下了深刻的印象。希望在这方面与省里加强合作。” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; 中老交通合作取得新进展。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; 中老铁路全长1035公里，为两国间搭建了便捷的物流通道。去年1月区域全面经济伙伴关系协定正式生效后，两国间物流服务需求大幅增长。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; 中老铁路国际货运班次从平均每班两列上升到每列一列。线路开通后的第二天，平均每天发车12趟。截至5月，该线路已运输货物超过2000万吨。铁路承载的货物种类已从开通之初的10余种，增加到2000余种。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; 尹副教授说：“老挝人民是务实的。”他们现在对具体的做事方式更感兴趣，比如如何销售农产品和更好地种植农作物。我告诉他们，我们喜欢老挝黑啤酒，他们立即询问如何找到啤酒销售的最佳零售渠道。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; “与直接援助相比，我认为他们更想了解方法改善他们的经济状况。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;span>;联系作者xinwen@chinadaily.com.cn&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 20 Oct 2023 05:21:05 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[001FRONT - President: Boost energy partnership with Russia]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://mobile.chinadaily.com.cn/cn/html5/2023-10/20/content_001_653196a8ed50d203d2ca0e45.htm#001FRONT]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;中方愿同俄方构建高水平能源伙伴关系，增强能源产业和供应链韧性，为推动中俄长期健康稳定发展作出贡献。习近平主席周四表示，要共同推动全球能源市场可持续发展。&lt;/p>;

&lt;p>; Southwest China&amp;#39;s Yunnan province is famous for its all-season blooming flowers, tea leaves picked by hand on mountain slopes and people from ethnic groups dressed in traditional clothing.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Yunnan has now gained more significance as the newly built China-Laos Railway connects it with Luang Namtha, a province in northern Laos that features a similar climate, ethnic customs and culinary culture.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; It has also become a magnet for Laotians who wish to experience the ecological, economic and tourism development in the province.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In May, a group of 10 Laotian village chiefs from Luang Namtha made a train journey to Kunming, the capital of Yunnan. Tong Xoc Piewmeu, 30, one of the 10 village heads, said that during the fact-finding trip, he focused on rice planting.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &amp;quot;In Laos, many villagers face financial constraints, and under the current economic situation, we are only allowed to engage in small-scale farming. Otherwise, we have to seek employment away from our villages,&amp;quot; said Piewmeu, who has been a village chief for 10 years.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &amp;quot;I hope that in the near future, we can try planting rice in our village to help local people benefit more from cultivation,&amp;quot; he added.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; From May 15 to 19, Piewmeu took part in a training class in Kunming designed for the village heads. They learned about modern agricultural cultivation techniques, the development of traditional Chinese medicine, China&amp;#39;s experiences in alleviating poverty, and measures to revitalize rural areas by promoting tourism and healthcare.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The first stop on the visit was the Lancang-Mekong International Vocational Institute at Yunnan Minzu University in Chenggong district, Kunming. The visitors attended a two-hour class taken by Yin Xiaoying, an associate professor at the university specializing in industrial integration.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In addition to the friendliness of the Laotians, Yin was impressed by their desire and passion for economic development and their specific interest in understanding the policies and measures implemented by the Chinese government for poverty alleviation and rural revitalization.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Yin said, &amp;quot;As far as I know, these village chiefs from the border area between China and Laos, especially those near the crossing points, proposed coming to Yunnan to learn and exchange ideas.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &amp;quot;To my surprise, they were enthusiastic during and after the class. They asked many questions and were fully engaged throughout the session.&amp;quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Yin instructed the visitors on development of the walnut industry in Yangbi Yi autonomous county, Dali Bai autonomous prefecture, Yunnan. They were also told how the province has improved industrial, production and operational systems in the agricultural sector.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The county is known for its walnut production, and in Guangming village, which sits on Cangshan Mountain in the east of Yangbi, walnut trees can be seen everywhere, with the oldest boasting a history of 1,165 years.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Local farmers relied on planting walnuts for a living, but in 2017, the price of walnuts suddenly plunged by 10 yuan ($1.4) per 500 grams. The villagers could not sell their crops for a good price, and factories processing the walnuts were struggling to stay in business.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; To cope with this sluggish market, the walnut growers considered establishing village cooperatives to manage and sell their produce in a more orderly way, in the hope of raising prices and the quality of their crops.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Yin also began conducting a five-year field study in 2017 to observe factors influencing the village&amp;#39;s economic development and methods to help lift local people out of poverty.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &amp;quot;I saw that they had diversified the way in which walnuts were produced. The villagers established a number of cooperatives, introduced smokeless ovens to bake walnuts, and expanded the distribution channel to establish e-commerce platforms for online sales,&amp;quot; Yin said.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &amp;quot;From farming to manufacturing, the walnuts produced were fully used, and the village also launched a group of specialized homestays to boost rural tourism.&amp;quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; During her lecture in Kunming to the Laotian village heads, Yin told them how Guangming was lifted out of poverty. The ensuing development of the walnut industry, along with accompanying measures to boost tourism, was also discussed.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &amp;quot;Because Guangming has a small economy, it is still exploring advanced processing of some agricultural produce, and has yet to achieve large-scale operation. However, the local tourism industry is booming due to its reliance on scenic Cangshan Mountain,&amp;quot; Yin said.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; She added that the Laotians wanted to learn more about such progress and how Guangming had achieved relatively fast economic growth, as their own villages are facing a similar situation.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;b>;Transportation links&lt;/b>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Laos has only three administrative levels: province, city and village. Each Laotian village has a chief, whose administrative power is second only to that of the mayor &amp;mdash; similar to a district or county head in China.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Due to a relatively low urbanization rate, most people in Laos still live in rural areas. Village chiefs act as a bridge between the government and the people, and in rural areas of the country, residents often have a close relationship with their village head.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Seng Xaiyavong, 44, head of Ban Borpied village, which is about 8 kilometers from Boten, a northern border crossing point with China, said 696 people live in the village, and most of them work in Boten during the day.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Two of the villagers work at Boten station on the China-Laos Railway, which is only about 1 km from their village, said Xaiyavong, who was among the village heads who took this rail line to Kunming for the exploratory tour. It was the first time that Xaiyavong had traveled abroad.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &amp;quot;I came to study, and learned a lot. I was particularly impressed by the rural tourism businesses that are flourishing in Gulang village, Anning, where natural hot springs help boost the local economy thanks to the development of related cultural tourism facilities,&amp;quot; he said.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Xaiyavong said boosting agricultural industries, which requires large amounts of capital and resources, is often beyond the reach of individuals. &amp;quot;Laos is different from China in terms of rural industry growth. We have a lot of room for improvement,&amp;quot; he added.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The opening of the China-Laos Railway in December 2021 boosted trade between the two countries, injecting new momentum into Laos&amp;#39; economic recovery, which was badly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Even though Laos had a short rail link along its border with Thailand before the China-Laos Railway opened, many Laotians consider the latter to be the country&amp;#39;s first modern rail line, and are proud of it.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Piewmeu, the village head, said: &amp;quot;People in our village depended on planting and tapping rubber trees for a living, because there is no local pillar industry. A few years ago, we could only sell the rubber to a local factory for a low price. With the railway opening, more business owners from China are now buying our rubber, and prices of the product have risen.&amp;quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; He said that traveling to Vientiane, capital of Laos, typically took two days by bus from Boten.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &amp;quot;After the railway opened, travel time to Vientiane was reduced to just four hours,&amp;quot; Piewmeu said, adding that villagers now choose to go out to work instead of staying at home to farm.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In addition to convenient transportation, Laotians&amp;#39; incomes have risen.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &amp;quot;We used to rely on natural conditions to make a living, but rarely thought about how we could improve our living standards,&amp;quot; Piewmeu said. &amp;quot;The railway connected us to the outside world, allowing Chinese businesspeople to come to our village. They saw opportunities, and I tried to recommend local projects to them to give the villagers more employment opportunities.&amp;quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;b>;Experience shared&lt;/b>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Communication with business owners in Kunming further strengthened the confidence of Laotian village chiefs in boosting development.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Qi Mingde, general manager of Yunnan Ruran Letu Agricultural Development Co in Anning, said the visitors were most interested in how Chinese entrepreneurs, as investors, have helped villagers raise their annual income from 18,000 yuan to 23,000 yuan in just two years. They also wanted to know why the entrepreneurs took the bold decision to make such a large-scale investment in a rural area.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &amp;quot;In the hope of earning a better living, the village chiefs were inspired to think outside the box and experiment to test the knowledge they gained from our experience in developing rural ecotourism,&amp;quot; Qi added.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; He said that in the past five years, his company has turned local farmers into shareholders by involving them in making decisions to fully tap local resources. The village&amp;#39;s 30 surplus laborers were all employed, and last year, the average monthly income of local residents reached about 3,000 yuan.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Qi said that to improve the village&amp;#39;s environment, areas where garbage was piled high were cleaned up and transformed into green zones. Residents&amp;#39; houses were renovated, and a walking path now surrounds the village to improve fitness levels.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &amp;quot;The average annual income of villagers in Gulang, where we developed rural tourism, has risen from 18,000 yuan five years ago to 23,000 yuan. The second phase of our tourism project has been completed, and the third phase will continue to expand the scale of operation,&amp;quot; he said.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; On an exploratory tour to the border, Qi saw that Laos boasts abundant natural resources.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &amp;quot;It is a good place to develop ecological tourism. The village chiefs may not be aware of the specific methods involved, but the pleasant environment in Laos could be used to improve tourist resources,&amp;quot; he said.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &amp;quot;Many Laotian village chiefs said they hoped to replicate the success that our company has had in Gulang in their own villages. They also plan to send more villagers and officials from relevant departments to China to learn from us.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &amp;quot;I have no hesitation in sharing our experience with the Laotian people and I am very willing to help the development of rural areas in Laos.&amp;quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The Laotians were also impressed by the agricultural planting techniques used by rural companies in Yunnan.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Xaiyavong, the Ban Borpied village head, said he hoped agricultural experts and technicians from Kunming would visit his village soon to guide residents in producing plant products in a more advanced technological way.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &amp;quot;We grow rubber, sugar cane and watermelons. Much of our produce is sold to other parts of China through Yunnan. I was deeply impressed by the diverse varieties of specialty crops, large-scale planting models, and the mature procurement and sale systems in Yunnan. I hope to strengthen cooperation with the province in this respect,&amp;quot; he said.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Progress has been made in cooperation between China and Laos in terms of transportation.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The 1,035-km China-Laos Railway has produced a convenient logistics channel between the two nations. After the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership officially took effect in January last year, demand for logistics services between the two countries greatly increased.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; International freight services on the China-Laos Railway have risen from an average of two trains a day after the line opened, to an average of 12 trains per day. As of May, more than 20 million metric tons of goods had been transported by the line. The types of goods carried by the railway have risen from just over 10 at its initial opening, to more than 2,000.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Yin, the associate professor, said: &amp;quot;The Laotian people are pragmatic. They are now more interested in the specific way of doing things, such as how to sell produce and better cultivate crops. I told them that we love the dark Laotian beer, and they immediately asked how they could find the best retail channels for beer sales.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &amp;quot;Compared with direct aid, I think they wanted to know more about methods to improve their economic situation.&amp;quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;span>;Contact the writers at xinwen@chinadaily.com.cn&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 20 Oct 2023 05:21:05 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[003TOP NEWS - Joint building of Belt and Road highlighted]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://mobile.chinadaily.com.cn/cn/html5/2023-10/20/content_003_653196abed50d203d2ca0e47.htm#003TOP NEWS]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://mobile.chinadaily.com.cn/cn/resfile/2023-10-20/003/20231020_003_01_11.png&quot; />;&lt;p>;Ukhnaa Khurelsukh&lt;/p>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://mobile.chinadaily.com.cn/cn/resfile/2023-10-20/003/20231020_003_01_15.png&quot; />;&lt;p>;Denis Sassou Nguesso&lt;/p>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://mobile.chinadaily.com.cn/cn/resfile/2023-10-20/003/20231020_003_01_18.png&quot; />;&lt;p>;Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedov&lt;/p>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://mobile.chinadaily.com.cn/cn/resfile/2023-10-20/003/20231020_003_01_22.png&quot; />;&lt;p>;Hun Manet&lt;/p>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://mobile.chinadaily.com.cn/cn/resfile/2023-10-20/003/20231020_003_01_27.png&quot; />;&lt;p>;Srettha Thavisin&lt;/p>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://mobile.chinadaily.com.cn/cn/resfile/2023-10-20/003/20231020_003_01_31.png&quot; />;&lt;p>;Adriano Maleiane&lt;/p>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://mobile.chinadaily.com.cn/cn/resfile/2023-10-20/003/20231020_003_01_34.png&quot; />;&lt;p>;Anwaar-ul-Haq Kakar&lt;/p>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://mobile.chinadaily.com.cn/cn/resfile/2023-10-20/003/20231020_003_01_38.png&quot; />;&lt;p>;Dilma Rousseff&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;b>;Mongolia&lt;/b>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; President Xi Jinping called on Mongolia on Thursday to play a greater role in advancing high-quality Belt and Road cooperation as a gateway linking Europe and Asia when meeting with Mongolian President Ukhnaa Khurelsukh.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Xi said that Mongolia, which was among the first to support the Belt and Road Initiative, is a natural partner in jointly building the Belt and Road.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Over the past decade, China and Mongolia have achieved greater synergy between their development strategies and witnessed encouraging results in cooperation in areas such as trade and investment, connectivity and livelihood projects, he said.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Xi said that the construction of the Belt and Road shares broad cooperation opportunities with Mongolia&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;Steppe Road Program&amp;quot; development strategy.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; He said that China is willing to uphold mutual respect for independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity with Mongolia, support each other in safeguarding core interests, and build a solid foundation for the China-Mongolia community with a shared future.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; China will continue to help Mongolia revitalize its economy, promote the construction of relevant border ports in an orderly manner and open up new channels for connectivity between the two countries, he said.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; As the China-Mongolia Desertification Prevention and Control Cooperation Center has been established, Xi said China is willing to continue supporting Mongolia&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;Planting One Billion Trees&amp;quot; plan.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; He also expressed China&amp;#39;s willingness to expand China-Mongolia-Russia cooperation and steadily promote the construction of the trilateral economic corridor.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Khurelsukh congratulated China for the successful hosting of the third Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation, saying that its outcomes will contribute to achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and give new momentum to global economic growth.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The two heads of state witnessed the signing of multiple bilateral cooperation documents in areas including cross-border railways, green and lowcarbon development and the digital economy.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; MO JINGXI&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;b>;Republic of Congo&lt;/b>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; President Xi Jinping called on Thursday for China and the Republic of Congo to explore new growth drivers for their cooperation in the digital economy and green development, while strengthening their partnership under the framework of the Belt and Road Initiative and the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Xi made the remarks during a meeting in Beijing with President of the Republic of Congo Denis Sassou Nguesso. He said the Republic of Congo is an active participant and important partner in the joint building of the Belt and Road.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The two countries have achieved tangible results in advancing cooperation by upholding the spirit of the Silk Road, which features peace and cooperation, openness and inclusiveness as well as mutual learning and mutual benefit, Xi said, adding that the successful implementation of projects such as the No 1 National Highway in the Republic of Congo is exemplary.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Noting that China and the Republic of Congo are true friends and good partners, Xi said that China values the friendship between the two countries and is willing to strengthen their pragmatic cooperation.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; China appreciates the resolute support given by the Republic of Congo on issues related to its core interests and major concerns, and it supports the African country in safeguarding its independence, opposing foreign interference and adhering to a development path that suits its national conditions, Xi said.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; China also supports the Republic of Congo in playing a greater role in international and regional affairs, and is willing to develop multilateral cooperation and coordinate with it to promote the construction of a more just and reasonable international order, he added.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Sassou Nguesso said the Belt and Road Initiative is a great project that provides the world with a new model of inclusive development.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Underlining that China is a major contributor to global economic growth, he said his country is willing to seize the opportunity of celebrating the 60th anniversary of diplomatic ties next year to further bilateral relations.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The Republic of Congo firmly adheres to the one-China policy and looks forward to continuing mutual support with China, and strengthening pragmatic cooperation in infrastructure, green energy and other fields, he added.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; CAO DESHENG&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;b>;Turkmenistan&lt;/b>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; President Xi Jinping underlined on Thursday China&amp;#39;s readiness to strengthen the alignment between the Belt and Road Initiative and Turkmenistan&amp;#39;s initiative to revive the Great Silk Road to make the ancient route a &amp;quot;road to happiness&amp;quot; in the new era.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Xi made the remark during a meeting with Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedov, national leader of the Turkmen people and chairman of the People&amp;#39;s Council of Turkmenistan.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Xi said China is a reliable friend and partner of Turkmenistan, and advancing the comprehensive strategic partnership between the two nations is in line with the fundamental interests of both countries and the common aspirations of the two peoples.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; China is willing to work with Turkmenistan to continue to uphold the principle of mutual respect and win-win cooperation, and to push for steady and long-term development of bilateral relations, he said.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Xi emphasized that mutual support is the essence of the China-Turkmenistan community with a shared future.

&lt;p>; MO JINGXI&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;b>;Pakistan&lt;/b>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; President Xi Jinping stressed on Thursday the need to use the 10th anniversary of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor as an opportunity to upgrade the project into a corridor for growth, livelihood, innovation, green development and openness.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; During a meeting with Pakistani Prime Minister Anwaarul-Haq Kakar in Beijing, Xi called for enhanced cooperation between Beijing and Islamabad on industrial parks, agriculture, mining and new energy, as well as the expedited implementation of major connectivity projects.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; He noted that the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor has secured fruitful results over the past decade as it effectively promoted Pakistan&amp;#39;s economic and social development and became a key signature project for jointly building the Belt and Road.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; China and Pakistan are all-weather strategic cooperation partners and their friendship is iron-clad, with successive governments in Pakistan actively supporting and participating in the Belt and Road cooperation, he noted.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Xi emphasized that China appreciates Pakistan&amp;#39;s long-standing and firm support for its core interests and will continue to support Pakistan in safeguarding its national sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity, as well as choosing a development path that suits its national conditions.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; He welcomed the export of more high-quality Pakistani agricultural products to China, while expressing the hope that Pakistan will ensure the safety of Chinese institutions and personnel in Pakistan.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; China is willing to strengthen cooperation with Pakistan within the United Nations and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization frameworks to promote regional unity and cooperation, and safeguard the legitimate interests of developing countries, he added.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Kakar, who took office in August as the eighth caretaker prime minister of Pakistan, hailed the tremendous success of the BRI over the past decade.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; He said the eight major steps proposed by Xi at the third Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation will not only enhance global connectivity but also promote a fairer and more equitable global governance system, providing important opportunities for development in Pakistan and other countries.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Pakistan will always be a trustworthy and reliable friend of China and will never allow any force to undermine this friendship, he said.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; XU WEI&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;b>;New Development Bank&lt;/b>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; President Xi Jinping said on Thursday that China welcomes the New Development Bank to participate in the Belt and Road Initiative and the Global Development Initiative in an effort to assist in the implementation of the United Nations 2030 Sustainable Development Goals and help more developing countries achieve modernization.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; He made the remarks during a meeting in Beijing with Dilma Rousseff who assumed her post in March as president of the multilateral development bank, which was established in 2015 by BRICS, the grouping of emerging economies that currently comprises Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Xi told Rousseff that China will continue to support the work of the Shanghai-headquartered NDB and facilitate her work in the country.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Recalling the signing of the agreement to establish the NDB during the BRICS Summit in Brazil in 2014, Xi said the bank has achieved remarkable results in recent years and has continued to grow.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Against the backdrop of intertwined risks and crises in today&amp;#39;s world, the NDB should play its due role as an important emerging force in the international financial system, he said.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Xi urged the bank to make the global financial system more just and equitable, and effectively enhance the representation and voice of emerging markets and developing countries, thus building itself into a new type of multilateral development institution in the 21st century.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Rousseff said it is necessary for all countries to address common challenges with collective action amid the current international situation. Strengthening infrastructure construction and connectivity is crucial for developing countries to achieve common development, she said.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; She noted that there has never been such an initiative as the BRI that can bring together more than 150 countries. The initiative and the Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation will play a crucial role in global sustainable development and green growth, she added.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The bank shares similar principles and concepts with the BRI and is willing to actively participate in Belt and Road cooperation and make due contributions to world multipolarity and the reform of the international financial system, she said.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; MO JINGXI&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 20 Oct 2023 05:21:05 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[004CHINA - UN official praises China for action taken against corruption]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://mobile.chinadaily.com.cn/cn/html5/2023-10/20/content_004_653196aeed50d203d2ca0e48.htm#004CHINA]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://mobile.chinadaily.com.cn/cn/resfile/2023-10-20/004/20231020_004_01_16.png&quot; />;&lt;p>;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Online&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt; See more by scanning the code.&lt;/p>; &lt;img src=&quot;https://mobile.chinadaily.com.cn/cn/resfile/2023-10-20/004/20231020_004_01_27.png&quot; />;&lt;p>;Ghada Waly&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; China&amp;#39;s significant role in advancing sustainable development as well as its proactive involvement in building international rules against corruption have been praised by an official from the United Nations.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &amp;quot;This is an important year as we mark the 20th anniversary of the UN Convention against Corruption,&amp;quot; said Ghada Waly, executive director of the UN Office on Drugs and Crime. &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m pleased to see that China has taken important steps to further align its anti-corruption framework with UNCAC requirements.&amp;quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; She made the remark during an exclusive interview with China Daily on the sidelines of the Thematic Forum on Clean Silk Road at the third Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation, which was held in Beijing on Wednesday.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Waly commended China for adopting the Mutual Legal Assistance Law in criminal matters in 2018 to ensure compliance with the UNCAC, providing a solid legal foundation for collaboration with foreign counterparts on transnational corruption.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; She also praised China&amp;#39;s active participation in the UNCAC Implementation Review Mechanism and its engagement in policy discussions.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &amp;quot;This involvement not only demonstrates China&amp;#39;s commitment but also its role and contribution in shaping international policies to combat corruption,&amp;quot; she said.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Waly welcomed several deliverables formed during the Thematic Forum on Clean Silk Road as new efforts initiated by China to promote transparency, integrity and ethical business practices within the context of the Belt and Road Initiative.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &amp;quot;The deliverables represent the commitment of BRI participating countries to eradicating corruption in investment projects and to enhancing international cooperation and strengthening partnership,&amp;quot; she said.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In recent years, the UN Office on Drugs and Crime has strengthened its capacities to combat corruption. In 2020, it started a project to foster sustainable development by supporting the implementation of the UNCAC in countries along the Silk Road Economic Belt, including safeguarding the integrity of international investment projects under the BRI.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; So far, such support has been provided to 16 member countries from across Central Asia and Southeast Europe, where the UNODC has conducted workshops and online sessions to facilitate the exchange of best practices.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Waly added that while some progress has been made, the international community is still facing challenges in areas of asset recovery and combating cross-border corruption.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; She said that there has been an increase in the number of countries engaging in asset recovery, but pointed out that many continue to rely on outdated policies and laws or bilateral treaties for international cooperation.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In addition to gaps in legislation, she added that other obstacles include inadequate technical skills and capacities, limited resources and a lack of trust among partners to cooperate globally.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Therefore, she encouraged more international cooperation and dialogue, noting that the UNODC has taken measures to support policy and technical discussions around those issues.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The UNODC has been working on setting up anti-corruption platforms and hubs in Latin America, Asia and Africa, with a deep commitment to supporting countries to build up their capacities to prevent the flow of the proceeds of corruption and recover stolen assets, primarily through the joint World Bank-UNODC Stolen Asset Recovery Initiative.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; It also provides tailored technical assistance activities, produces a wide range of manuals, tools and training materials, and offers dedicated on-site guidance and advice through strategic partnerships with other international and regional organizations.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &amp;quot;But our work is not limited to engagement with &amp;#39;requesting&amp;#39; countries,&amp;quot; Waly said. &amp;quot;Very importantly, UNODC through the stolen asset recovery initiative supports international efforts to end safe havens for corrupt funds.&amp;quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; She emphasized that the initiative has brought together the strengths of both the UNODC and the World Bank, saying that it has worked with financial centers to prevent the laundering of proceeds of corruption and to facilitate the more systematic and timely return of stolen assets.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &amp;quot;Looking ahead, we&amp;#39;re keen to drive these changes forward, and we&amp;#39;re fully dedicated to working hand in hand with our partners and member states to combat corruption, end impunity, recover stolen assets and promote integrity on a global scale,&amp;quot; she added.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Waly, with 28 years of work experience in the field of poverty reduction and social protection, has held her position at the UN since February 2020. She is the first woman, first Arab and first African to lead the UNODC. Prior to joining the UN, Waly was minister of social solidarity in Egypt.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;span>;caoyin@chinadaily.com.cn&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 20 Oct 2023 05:21:05 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[004CHINA - Sci-fi fan]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://mobile.chinadaily.com.cn/cn/html5/2023-10/20/content_004_653196b0ed50d203d2ca0e49.htm#004CHINA]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://mobile.chinadaily.com.cn/cn/resfile/2023-10-20/004/20231020_004_02_21.png&quot; />;&lt;p>;A young science fiction enthusiast tries on a helmet from the sci-fi movie Wandering Earth at the 81st World Science Fiction Convention in Chengdu, Sichuan province, on Wednesday.

The black dog attacked them, leaving the daughter with multiple injuries including a damaged kidney and a rib fracture, according to the police in Chongzhou.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; An investigation team in Chongzhou said on Tuesday that the girl&amp;#39;s vital signs were stable after being transferred to West China Hospital of Sichuan University in Chengdu for further treatment.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &amp;quot;My child was badly injured and needs a huge amount of money for treatment. We have no choice but to launch an online fundraising campaign,&amp;quot; one of the child&amp;#39;s family members posted online. &amp;quot;All we want is her recovery.&amp;quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; As of 5 pm on Wednesday, the family had raised 1.5 million yuan ($205,000) in donations via the online fundraising platform Qingsongchou, according to Shangyou News.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The police have caught the dog and the dog&amp;#39;s owner, surnamed Tang, has been detained pending charges.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The Rottweiler breed of dog is a strong and fierce breed that is prohibited in major cities such as Beijing, Shanghai and Chongqing, reported Dahe News. However, it is not included on the list of 22 prohibited breeds in Chengdu.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The incident has sparked widespread public outrage. One user on microblogging platform Sina Weibo called for the maximum penalty. &amp;quot;If these incidents aren&amp;#39;t harshly punished, many irresponsible dog owners will continue to neglect their responsibilities.&amp;quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; To curb such incidents and enhance public safety, numerous regions are rolling out stringent dog management strategies.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In Shehong, Sichuan province, a comprehensive dog registration and licensing system will be enforced. Owners of dogs in urban areas will be mandated to register their pets and undergo annual inspections. The possession of fierce breeds and large dogs will be prohibited to mitigate potential risks.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; When outside the home, dogs must wear a dog tag and be on a leash. They must be led by a person with full legal capacity or be accompanied by someone who has it. When walking dogs, people must give way to the elderly, disabled individuals, pregnant women, children and pedestrians.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Regions like the Ebian Yi autonomous county in Sichuan are taking decisive action against unrestrained dogs. Unleashed dogs found in public spaces will be treated as strays and captured, and owners held accountable for any ensuing consequences. Similar initiatives have been launched in Hefei, Anhui province, where unleashed dogs in public areas will face capture, reinforcing the importance of responsible pet ownership.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;span>;wangsongsong@chinadaily.com.cn&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 20 Oct 2023 05:21:05 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[004CHINA - Preparations for liftoff]]></title><link/><![CDATA[https://mobile.chinadaily.com.cn/cn/html5/2023-10/20/content_004_653196b6ed50d203d2ca0e4b.htm#004CHINA]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;/div>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://mobile.chinadaily.com.cn/cn/resfile/2023-10-20/004/20231020_004_04_31.png&quot; />;&lt;p>;The Shenzhou XVII manned spaceship, atop a Long March 2F carrier rocket, is transported vertically to the launching area of the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in northwestern China on Thursday.
