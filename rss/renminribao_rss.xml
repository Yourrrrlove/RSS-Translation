As all-round strategic partners, China and Germany move forward together in the spirit of mutual benefit, win-win and mutual achievement, and grow together in the spirit of learning from each other&#39;s strengths, exchanges and mutual learning. This is a valuable experience of the smooth development of China-Germany relations over the past few decades and is worthy of both sides. Cherish and pass on. Sino-German cooperation is open and pragmatic, and it is constantly enriching and developing. At present, Sino-German trade is developing steadily, two-way investment enthusiasm is rising, and cooperation between the two countries has become more robust, solid and dynamic.

China-EU relations are related to the stability of the world structure and the prosperity of the Eurasian continent, and deserve every effort from both sides to safeguard and develop them. China regards Europe as a comprehensive strategic partner and an important pole in multipolarity. It is hoped that Germany will push the EU to uphold the principles of marketization and fairness, work with China to safeguard fair market competition and free trade, and maintain the stability of global industrial and supply chains. &lt;/P>;&lt;P>;Scholz said that I visited China in November last year shortly after the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China.

Over the past year, a new round of Germany-China government consultations has been successfully held, dialogue and exchanges at all levels have been rapidly restored, economic and trade relations have become closer, cooperation projects have continued to advance, and deepening Germany-China relations has shown more possibilities and broad prospects.

Xi Jinping pointed out that whether it is the Palestinian-Israeli conflict or the Ukrainian crisis, to solve it from the root, we need to think more deeply about security issues, adhere to a common, comprehensive, cooperative, and sustainable security concept, and promote the construction of balanced, effective, and sustainable security architecture. Squeezing the security space of other countries and unilaterally supporting one side while ignoring the legitimate demands of the other will lead to regional imbalances and lead to the expansion and escalation of conflicts. China and Europe should be committed to mediating conflicts, easing tensions, and playing a positive role in promoting regional peace and development. &lt;/P>;&lt;P>;Wang Yi attended the meeting. &lt;/P>;&lt;!--/enpcontent-->;</description><pubDate> Sat, 04 Nov 2023 05:56:07 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[01版要闻 - 习近平向第五届中美友城大会致信]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://paper.people.com.cn/rmrb/html/2023-11/04/nw.D110000renmrb_20231104_3-01.htm]]><description> &lt;div>;Saturday, November 4, 2023&lt;/div>; &lt;!--enpcontent-->;&lt;P>;Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, November 3&amp;nbsp; Letter from the Meiyou City Conference. &lt;/P>;&lt;P>;Xi Jinping pointed out that the foundation of Sino-US relations lies in the people and the source of strength lies in people-to-people friendship.

The relevant person in charge of Schneider Electric said that China&#39;s strong innovation atmosphere and abundant talents provide a good soil for nurturing innovation. At the same time, the complete industrial chain foundation and rich application scenarios ensure that innovation results can be implemented. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;——Adhering to inclusiveness and universal benefit, the CIIE helps all parties develop together and share results. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The CIIE provides free standard booths and fee reduction measures to the least developed countries. In the first five sessions, it has attracted a total of 43 recommended companies from the least developed countries to participate in the exhibition, while using &quot;cloud investment&quot; and &quot;cloud exhibition&quot; and other innovative ways to actively promote the specialty foods, traditional crafts and tourism culture of relevant countries. With the help of the CIIE, East Timor&#39;s coffee, Afghanistan&#39;s pine nuts, Cambodia&#39;s purple cashews, etc. have achieved unprecedented sales results in the Chinese market, and local people feel that life is &quot;increasingly promising.&quot; &quot;This is a unique expo in the world!&quot; said Alokuzai, vice chairman of the Afghan Chamber of Commerce and Investment.

At the Shanghai Hongqiao Imported Commodities Exhibition and Trading Center, the “CIIE Good Products Shopping Collection” has a dazzling array of products. It provides a year-round exhibition and sales platform for small and medium-sized enterprises participating in the CIIE. Since the first CIIE, Shanghai has certified a total of 60 &quot;6-day + 365-day&quot; trading service platforms, introduced nearly 270,000 kinds of exhibits (pieces), and accumulated imported goods exceeding 323 billion yuan. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Trade is a mathematical problem that can produce miracles, with a win-win effect of &quot;1+1>;2&quot;. Behind every order is not just a simple purchase and sale of products, but a deep integration of services, technologies, etc.; behind every order, there is a long industrial chain and supply chain, which drives the industrial upgrading and improvement of people&#39;s livelihood in relevant countries and regions. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Responsible at critical moments. Faced with the rise of unilateralism and protectionism and the countercurrent to economic globalization, China initiated and held the world&#39;s first import-themed national exhibition so far to further open up its own market and mark the path of win-win global cooperation. new heights. Hassan Hashemi, former CEO of Dubai Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said: &quot;The CIIE is a link connecting global companies with the Chinese market and has a profound impact on global trade and world economic development.&quot;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong >;(2)&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“When we entered the CIIE, almost the entire Chinese market was vividly displayed in front of us.” German special glass manufacturing company SCHOTT Group once said I participated in the first CIIE with the mentality of &quot;try it out&quot;, but I didn&#39;t expect that from then on, I would &quot;check in&quot; at the CIIE every year, increase investment in China, build new factories, introduce high-end production lines, and establish R&amp;D centers. The head of SCHOTT Group China bluntly said, &quot;We have achieved unparalleled growth with the CIIE. Continuous investment in the Chinese market is our future strategic choice.&quot;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The CIIE comes as scheduled every year , becoming one of the most vivid scenes to experience the Chinese economy. Inside and outside the venue, exhibits become commodities, exhibitors become investors, and &quot;first-time customers&quot; become &quot;repeat customers.&quot; More and more multinational companies are deeply embedded in China&#39;s industrial chain and innovation chain, renewing longer-term agreements with China and cultivating deeper relationships. friendship. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Since this year, the Danfoss Global Refrigeration R&amp;D and Testing Center has been put into use in Tianjin, BASF’s Zhanjiang Integrated Base Syngas Plant Project has broken ground, and the 2 millionth vehicle of Tesla’s Shanghai Gigafactory has rolled out of the production line. The second final assembly line of the A320 series aircraft invested and constructed in China has begun construction... Multinational companies continue to increase capital and expand production in China, and project construction is accelerating. In the first nine months of this year, 37,814 new foreign-invested enterprises were established in China, a year-on-year increase of 32.4%; actual investment in China from France, the United Kingdom, Canada, Switzerland, and the Netherlands increased by 121.7%, 116.9%, 109.2%, 76.9%, and 32.6% respectively ( Including investment data through freeports). &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Through the window of the CIIE, the world has seen the strong resilience and vitality of the Chinese economy in promoting in-depth reforms and promoting high-quality development with a high level of opening up to the outside world. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Currently, the world economic recovery is struggling, global inflation remains high, and the spillover effects of tightening monetary policies in major economies are prominent. Facing a more complex and severe external environment, China&#39;s economy has withstood the pressure and continued to recover, stabilizing its scale and improving its quality. Its economic growth rate ranks among the best among the world&#39;s major economies. In the first three quarters of this year, China&#39;s GDP grew by 5.2% year-on-year, and international organizations and institutions have raised their expectations for China&#39;s economic growth. Bolger Brende, President of the World Economic Forum, believes that China has taken many correct measures to support economic growth and he is full of confidence in the Chinese economy. Steven Barnett, chief representative of the International Monetary Fund in China, said at the recent press conference of the World Economic Outlook Report: &quot;China remains the largest engine of global economic growth, contributing one-third of global growth.&quot; &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;When observing China’s economy, we must focus on the present and take a long-term view. In the first three quarters of this year, final consumption expenditure contributed 83.2% to economic growth, and investment in high-tech industries increased by 11.4% year-on-year. During the recent Mid-Autumn Festival and National Day holiday, 826 million domestic tourist trips were made, and domestic tourism revenue was 753.43 billion yuan. “The most popular Golden Week adds impetus to China’s economic recovery” has become a hot topic for many foreign media. China has the institutional advantages of a socialist market economy, the demand advantage of a very large-scale market, the supply advantage of a complete industrial system, and the talent advantage of a large number of high-quality workers and entrepreneurs. China&#39;s economy is highly resilient, has great potential, and is full of vitality. Its long-term positive fundamentals will not change. China&#39;s economic ship will ride the wind and waves and continue to move forward. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;China has unswervingly promoted a higher level of opening up and proactively expanded imports, ranking as the world&#39;s second largest import market for 14 consecutive years. The world&#39;s second largest consumer market and largest online retail market, with a population of more than 1.4 billion and more than 400 million middle-income groups, continues to exert its appeal and welcomes companies and investors from all over the world. Tan Sen, Chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai, believes: &quot;We have seen that many companies with large global markets need to achieve economies of scale. If you do not come to China, you will not be able to achieve the economic scale required to maintain global competitiveness.&quot;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;The river that runs towards the sea crosses mountains and deep valleys, and goes through ups and downs, but its momentum of galloping forward remains unchanged. As the driving force for innovation continues to grow, the economic structure continues to be optimized, and the endogenous driving force gathers strength, China, which is making strides on the path of high-quality development, will provide the world with new opportunities with China&#39;s large market. The head of McKinsey China said that China has created the &quot;Chinese Miracle&quot; in the history of world economic development and will create new miracles in the future. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;(3)&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Business is connected to the world, people from all over the world are gathered together; civilizations are blended and colorful. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Overlooking Shanghai, all the way eastward from the &quot;Four-Leaf Clover&quot; of the CIIE, the beautiful picture of the China (Shanghai) Pilot Free Trade Zone unfolds: industrial parks lined with high-rise buildings, modern factories with advanced facilities, Lively and busy port terminal. In this fertile land of openness, the business environment is excellent, customs clearance efficiency is high, and modern industrial systems such as &quot;Chinese chips&quot;, &quot;innovative drugs&quot;, &quot;intelligent manufacturing&quot;, &quot;future cars&quot; and &quot;data ports&quot; are ready to develop. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;This year marks the 45th anniversary of China’s reform and opening up and the 10th anniversary of the construction of the pilot free trade zone. In the China Pavilion of the National Exhibition of the China International Import Expo, a &quot;Tenth Anniversary Achievements Exhibition of the Construction of China Free Trade Pilot Zone&quot; will be set up. Over the past 10 years, the construction of China&#39;s free trade pilot zones started in Shanghai and has continued to develop, forming a &quot;flying geese array&quot; with 22 free trade pilot zones, building a new pattern of reform and opening up covering the east, west, south, north, and center, and coordinating coastal, inland, and border areas. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;From the launch of the country’s first negative list for foreign investment access to the launch of the country’s first international trade “single window”; from the creation of the first batch of free trade accounts to the establishment of the country’s first wholly foreign-owned Automobile manufacturing companies... The free trade pilot zone has created many &quot;firsts&quot; in China&#39;s reform and opening up process, deployed more than 3,500 reform pilot tasks, and replicated and promoted 302 institutional innovation results nationwide. In the first half of this year, the pilot free trade zone contributed 18.4% of the country’s foreign investment and 18.6% of its import and export trade. More and more companies are turning policy opportunities and open opportunities into development opportunities here. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Reform will never stop, and opening up will never stop. After 10 years of development, the Pilot Free Trade Zone has become a new highland for reform and opening up in the new era, witnessing China&#39;s determination to unswervingly promote high-level opening up, promote high-quality development, and its ambition to share opportunities with the world. The negative list for foreign investment access continues to be reduced. Only the free trade pilot zone version of the negative list for foreign investment access has been reduced seven times, from 190 items to 27 items. Promote the reduction of institutional transaction costs, promote the construction of supporting laws and regulations for foreign investment laws, and expand the opening up of agriculture, mining, manufacturing, and service industries...China&#39;s market opening to the outside world is unprecedentedly large, wide-ranging, and deep-level. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;In June this year, the State Council issued a document to take the lead in launching pilot projects in five qualified free trade pilot zones and Hainan Free Trade Port, including Shanghai, Guangdong, Tianjin, Fujian, and Beijing, to align with relevant international high standards. Economic and trade rules explore paths and accumulate experience for steadily expanding institutional opening up. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“Opening up is a distinctive symbol of contemporary China.” President Xi Jinping has delivered keynote speeches and speeches at the opening ceremony of the CIIE for five consecutive years, in which the word “opening up” appeared more than a hundred times. A series of measures to expand opening-up announced by President Xi Jinping at the CIIE have been implemented one by one, effectively promoting new progress in high-level opening-up. From the establishment of the Lingang New Area of ​​the Shanghai Pilot Free Trade Zone to the implementation of integrated regional development in the Yangtze River Delta, from the release and implementation of the overall plan for the construction of the Hainan Free Trade Port and the implementation plan for Shenzhen’s further expansion of reform and opening up to the continued improvement of the business environment and strengthening of intellectual property protection … China must be true to its word and resolute in its deeds. It has promoted deepening reform by expanding opening-up, and promoted opening-up by deepening reform. It has not only developed itself, but also benefited the world. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;At the third &quot;Belt and Road&quot; International Cooperation Summit Forum, President Xi Jinping announced that restrictions on foreign investment access in the manufacturing sector will be completely lifted. Actively follow international high-standard economic and trade rules, further promote high-level opening up of cross-border service trade and investment, expand market access for digital products, and deepen reforms in the fields of state-owned enterprises, digital economy, intellectual property, and government procurement. International people have expressed praise: &quot;This releases a strong signal for China to further deepen reform and opening up&quot; and &quot;once again highlights China&#39;s determination to expand opening-up in an all-round way and the practical measures it takes.&quot; During the summit forum, China and 34 countries jointly released the &quot;International Economic and Trade Cooperation Framework Initiative on Digital Economy and Green Development&quot;, which is of great significance for all parties to jointly respond to the challenges of the digital divide and green barriers and better share the dividends of digital and green development. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“China is particularly good at building bridges.” At the opening ceremony of the first CIIE, Christine Lagarde, then president of the International Monetary Fund, said that reform and opening up allowed China to build a bridge to the world. Today, China We are still building a bridge to prosperity and a bridge to the future. &quot;The CIIE is a symbol of the bridge to prosperity. It is beneficial to China and benefits the whole world.&quot;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;After more than 40 years of reform and opening up, China has accumulated more than just economic The growth in the world is also a profound understanding and recognition of the road to world prosperity and development: openness brings progress, while closure will inevitably lead to backwardness. China&#39;s economic development achievements have been achieved under open conditions, and future high-quality economic development must also be carried out under more open conditions. As President Xi Jinping emphasized: &quot;China&#39;s door to opening up will not close, but will only open wider and wider. China&#39;s efforts to promote a higher level of opening up will not stop! China&#39;s efforts to promote an open world economy will not stop! China&#39;s efforts to promote a higher level of opening up will not stop! The pace of building a community with a shared future for mankind will not stop!&quot;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;This is a commitment, but also an action. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;(4)&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The world today is undergoing a new round of major development, changes and adjustments. The economic and social development of various countries are increasingly closely linked, and the global governance system and Changes in the international order are accelerating. At the same time, the recovery and development of the world economy is facing various challenges. Unilateralism and protectionism are on the rise. Multilateralism and the free trade system are under attack. Some countries have built &quot;small courtyards and high walls&quot;, forced &quot;decoupling and chain breaking&quot;, and clamored for &quot;supply chain&quot; De-risk”. Relevant studies show that in recent years, the &quot;World Openness Index&quot; has continued to decline, and the global consensus on openness has tended to weaken. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Standing at the crossroads of history, should we unite or divide, be open or closed, should we cooperate or confront? How to choose is related to the overall interests of mankind and also tests the wisdom of all countries. When some countries raise protectionist fences higher and higher, why does China open its door wider and wider? &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;At the CIIE, President Xi Jinping vividly explained the underlying logic: “Throughout the history of international economic and trade development, it has been profoundly verified that ‘if we are connected, we will advance together, and if we are related, we will retreat’. Countries are reducing barriers. 、扩大开放，国际经贸就能打通血脉；如果以邻为壑、孤立封闭，国际经贸就会气滞血瘀，世界经济也难以健康发展。”“经济全球化是历史潮流。长江、尼罗河、亚马孙河、多瑙河昼夜不息、奔腾向前，尽管会出现一些回头浪，尽管会遇到很多险滩暗礁，但大江大河奔腾向前的势头是谁也阻挡不了的。”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;今天，进博会之所以全球瞩目，不仅因其展示了中国市场的巨大魅力，更因为在这里、在中国，国际社会收获了相向而行、合作共赢的重要成果，强化了“拉手”而不是“松手” 、“拆墙”而不是“筑墙”的坚定信心。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;今年以来，第三届消博会汇聚3300多个优质消费品牌参展，2023年服贸会达成1100余项成果，第二十届中国—东盟博览会签订投资合作项目470个，第134届广交会前两期共计吸引15.72万名境外采购商到会……中国搭台的一场场国际盛会精彩纷呈，形成强大的矩阵力量，不断传递出“我们敞开大门，谁来同我们合作都欢迎”的诚意。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;中国以实际行动持续推进贸易和投资自由化便利化，更好实现中国和其他国家利益融合。今年，中国与厄瓜多尔、尼加拉瓜、塞尔维亚签署自贸协定。至此，中国已与29个国家和地区签署22个自贸协定。中国高质量实施《区域全面经济伙伴关系协定》（RCEP），积极推进加入《全面与进步跨太平洋伙伴关系协定》（CPTPP）和《数字经济伙伴关系协定》（DEPA）……中国推进高水平对外开放的步履更坚实、信心更坚定。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;今年8月，金砖国家领导人第十五次会晤期间，金砖国家领导人一致同意，邀请沙特、埃及、阿联酋、阿根廷、伊朗、埃塞俄比亚正式成为金砖大家庭成员，金砖合作机制迎来历史性扩员。 9月，拥有55个成员的非盟受邀成为二十国集团正式成员……“全球南方”在国际舞台展现出愈发自信的风采，凸显新兴市场国家和发展中国家追求独立自主、团结合作的强烈意愿，也再次证明，“开放合作仍然是历史潮流，互利共赢依然是人心所向”。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;作为发展中国家、“全球南方”的一员，中国始终同其他发展中国家同呼吸、共命运，坚定维护发展中国家共同利益，推动增加新兴市场国家和发展中国家在全球事务中的代表性和发言权。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;中国始终坚信，只有合作共赢才能办成事、办好事、办大事。只要各国有合作的愿望、协调的行动，天堑可以变通途，“陆锁国”可以变成“陆联国”，发展的洼地可以变成繁荣的高地。经济发展快一些的国家，要拉一把暂时走在后面的伙伴。只要大家把彼此视为朋友和伙伴，相互尊重、相互支持、相互成就，赠人玫瑰则手有余香，成就别人也是帮助自己。把别人的发展视为威胁，把经济相互依存视为风险，不会让自己生活得更好、发展得更快。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;有怎样的眼界，就能看到怎样的远方；有多大的胸襟，就能包纳多大的世界。包容普惠、互利共赢才是越走越宽的人间正道。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;（五）&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;进博会上，吉祥物“进宝”吸引着各国客商争相合影。充满活力的“进宝”，佩戴着一条黄蓝相间的围巾，其中黄色代表了“丝绸之路经济带”，蓝色代表了“21世纪海上丝绸之路”，这从一个视角映照了进博会与共建“一带一路”倡议的紧密联系。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;进博会，因共建“一带一路”倡议而生，应“一带一路”合作而兴。正是在2017年首届“一带一路”国际合作高峰论坛上，习近平主席宣布中国将从2018年起举办中国国际进口博览会。几年来，越来越多“一带一路”共建国家的企业通过进博会平台进入中国市场、共享发展红利。截至目前，“一带一路”共建国家已有超过1500家企业签约第六届进博会企业商业展，总展览面积近8万平方米，面积较上届增长约30%。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“以前我们只知道种咖啡，不知道种植茶树也能带来经济效益。”老挝占巴塞省巴松县的村民曾经差点把野生古茶树砍掉。结缘进博会后，当地茶叶有了新出路。从2019年开始出口中国，如今实现年均20%的出口增速。 2021年12月，中老铁路开通后，茶叶运输节省了2/3的时间，成本大大降低。中国企业还聘请专家为村民传授种茶技能，带动脱贫致富，当地贫困户比例从几年前的超过50%降到如今的不足5%。进博会与共建“一带一路”的合力效应愈加显现。在澳大利亚经济学家郭生祥看来，中国市场开放成果与互联互通成果相结合，更直接造福共建“一带一路”合作各方。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;百年变局加速演进，各种新旧问题与复杂矛盾叠加碰撞、交织发酵。人类社会面临前所未有的挑战，不稳定、不确定、难预料成为常态。面对全球治理体系变革的重大课题，习近平主席站在人类历史发展进程的高度，提出构建人类命运共同体理念，为彷徨求索的世界点亮前行之路，为各国人民走向携手同心共护家园、共享繁荣的美好未来贡献中国方案。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;共建“一带一路”倡议是构建人类命运共同体的生动实践。 10年来，“一带一路”合作从亚欧大陆延伸到非洲和拉美，中国与各方合作开展了3000多个务实项目，拉动近1万亿美元投资。瓜达尔港从昔日人烟稀少的渔村变成中巴经济走廊的“明珠”，中老铁路开建以来带动11万人次就业，雅万高铁成为东南亚国家首条实现时速350公里的铁路，蒙内铁路拉动当地经济增长超过2个百分点，马拉维600眼水井润泽当地15万民众……一条条“幸福路”、一座座“连心桥”、一片片“发展带”在共建国家不断涌现，一个个“小而美、见效快、惠民生”项目不断增进当地民众的获得感、幸福感。正如联合国秘书长古特雷斯所说，在共建“一带一路”倡议推动下，各国在基础设施领域获得更多机遇，加速落实可持续发展目标，“这为数十亿民众以及我们共享的地球带来希望和进步”。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;和平稳定、物质丰富、精神富有是人类社会发展的基本追求。中国提出全球发展倡议、全球安全倡议、全球文明倡议，从发展、安全、文明三个维度指明人类社会前进方向，彼此呼应、相得益彰，成为推动构建人类命运共同体的重要依托。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;——全球发展倡议发出聚焦发展、重振合作的时代强音，高度契合联合国2030年可持续发展议程，尤其呼应了广大发展中国家追求发展的心声。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;——全球安全倡议秉持共同安全理念，重视综合施策，坚持合作之道，倡导走出一条对话而不对抗、结伴而不结盟、共赢而非零和的新型安全之路。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;——全球文明倡议强调要共同倡导尊重世界文明多样性，共同倡导弘扬全人类共同价值，共同倡导重视文明传承和创新，共同倡导加强国际人文交流合作，向全世界发出增进文明交流对话、在包容互鉴中促进人类文明进步的真挚呼吁。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;中国理念、中国倡议，包含丰富思想意蕴，体现高度责任担当，闪耀人文主义光辉。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“习近平主席提出的共建&#39;一带一路&#39;倡议、全球发展倡议、全球安全倡议、全球文明倡议，完全符合尊重各国独立、主权、不同文明交流互鉴等国际关系准则，有利于维护真正的多边主义、促进世界和平安全与共同发展，推动建立更加公正合理的国际秩序。”毛里塔尼亚总统加兹瓦尼表示，毛方高度赞赏、积极支持。新开发银行行长、巴西前总统罗塞夫认为，“尊重不同文化背景，尊重文明多样性，谋求共享发展、共同繁荣。习近平主席提出的一系列理念和主张具有强大感召力，为人类提供了一个新的视角，即全人类是一个命运共同体。”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;以天下之利为利、以人民之心为心。在推动构建人类命运共同体的进程中，中国将以更宽阔视野、更开放胸襟、更积极姿态，同国际社会一道，为世界和平稳定尽责，为人类繁荣进步出力。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;***&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;***&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;开放是人类文明进步的重要动力，是世界繁荣发展的必由之路。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;进博会是中国的，更是世界的。进博会的成功，印证着“世界好，中国才会好；中国好，世界会更好”的深刻内涵和宏阔境界。以开放纾发展之困、以开放汇合作之力、以开放聚创新之势、以开放谋共享之福，就能推动经济全球化不断向前，增强各国发展动能，让发展成果更多更公平惠及各国人民。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;面向未来，中国将始终站在历史正确的一边，站在人类文明进步的一边，愿同各国一道，践行真正的多边主义，凝聚更多开放共识，共同克服全球经济发展面临的困难和挑战，让开放为全球发展带来新的光明前程！ &lt;/p>;&lt;!--/enpcontent-->;
