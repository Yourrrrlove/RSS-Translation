According to the agricultural situation dispatch of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, more than 80% of the autumn grain has been harvested nationwide, and grain production throughout the year is expected to have another bumper harvest. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;b>;Improving quality, ensuring quantity, expanding space, and maintaining a stable foundation for food security&lt;/b>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Since this year, various regions and departments have given greater priority to improving comprehensive agricultural production capabilities. Prominent position, effectively strengthen the protection of cultivated land, make every effort to improve the quality of cultivated land, steadily expand agricultural production space, implement detailed disaster prevention and reduction measures, and ensure that food can be produced and supplied at all times. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Improve the quality and enhance the ability of farmland to resist and reduce disasters. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The rice in the black soil of Northeast China is fragrant. &quot;This year, the rice yield per mu is 1,200 kilograms. The waterlogging disaster has not reduced the yield. High-standard farmland has been a big help.&quot; Zhang Youguo, a rice farmer in Tianmen Township, Fangzheng County, Heilongjiang Province, said that the high-standard farmland project area has a complete drainage and irrigation system, timely drainage and fertilization, and thin pipes. Protective measures have been taken to ensure output. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;This year, Fangzheng County implemented 47,100 acres of high-standard farmland project construction to improve farmland’s ability to resist disasters and reduce disasters, and further consolidate the foundation for food security. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Regions have vigorously improved the construction standards and quality of high-standard farmland. The average cultivated land quality of farmland in the project area has increased by about 1 grade, the average grain output per mu has generally increased by 10% to 20%, and the ability to resist and reduce disasters has been continuously improved. By the end of last year, a total of 1 billion acres of high-standard farmland had been built across the country. This year’s task is to build 45 million acres of new farmland and renovate and upgrade 35 million acres. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Guarantee the quantity and protect the &quot;rice bowl field&quot;. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“During the autumn harvest, I patrol the fields twice more than usual.” Early in the morning, Yang Zhili, the “field chief” and village party branch secretary of Houzhuang Village, Laocheng Town, Wucheng County, Shandong Province, got busy, “ There are more than 1,000 acres of arable land in the village. We take good care of the fertile land and usher in another bumper harvest season.&quot;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;At present, Wucheng County has fully implemented the field chief system and established a three-level field chief system at the county, township and village levels. , using administrative villages as the basic units to divide grid responsibility areas, and set up 453 &quot;field chiefs&quot; in the county to ensure that the amount of cultivated land and permanent basic farmland area will not be reduced, and to firmly adhere to the red line of cultivated land protection. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;We have established a dense farmland protection network, adhered to the principle of good land for grain use, strictly regulated the balance of farmland occupation and compensation, and steadily and orderly implemented the balance of farmland entry and exit. The field head system has taken root in 26 provinces (autonomous regions and municipalities). . A series of hard measures to protect cultivated land have continuously consolidated the foundation of the granary of this great country. This year, the intended planting area of ​​grain nationwide is more than 1.77 billion acres, increasing for the fourth consecutive year. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Expand space and comprehensively transform and utilize saline-alkali land. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;In Guanshantun, Beizheng Town, Changling County, Jilin Province, there is a &quot;new green&quot; on the saline-alkali land that was originally difficult to grow any grass. The team of Cao Xiaofeng, an academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, came to Changling County to demonstrate technology for the improvement and utilization of severely saline-alkali land. According to the yield test results of the saline-alkali land, it is expected to produce 620 kilograms of sesbania hay per mu. &quot;It&#39;s different when experts go to the fields to improve the soil. Green manure sesbania can also grow in severely saline-alkali soil.&quot; Ye Shuwen, a grain farmer, said. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Saline-alkali land is an important source of &quot;improving quality, expanding capacity, and increasing efficiency&quot; of cultivated land. All regions have fully tapped the potential of comprehensive utilization of saline-alkali land and carried out management and improvement of saline-alkali cultivated land in different regions and categories. Since 2020, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs has carried out pilot projects to treat salinized cultivated land in 8 provinces, with a total of 2.4 million acres of implementation implemented in 3 years. The quality of cultivated land in the project area has improved by an average of 0.11 to 0.51 grades, and the soil salinity has been reduced by about 2‰ on average. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;b>;Strengthen the support of agricultural science and technology, and new agronomy help grow good food&lt;/b>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;To solve the problem of food, the fundamental solution lies in science and technology. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Led by the research on key and core agricultural technologies and oriented by industrial demand, various regions and departments focus on chassis technology, core provenance, key agricultural machinery and equipment and other fields, and continuously strengthen agricultural science and technology support. At present, the contribution rate of my country’s agricultural science and technology progress reaches 62.4%. The &quot;golden pole&quot; of the folks is becoming more and more stable as it is picked up. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Agricultural machinery adds power, and farming becomes &quot;smart farming.&quot; &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“Having a good helper for farming makes me more confident.” Song Yi, a major grain grower in Lujiaba Village, Baishui Town, Wangcang County, Sichuan Province, first opened the application on his mobile phone to check the operation status of the harvester. . This year, his family planted more than 30 acres of rice relying on smart agricultural machinery to achieve precise sowing, fertilization, pesticide application, irrigation and harvesting, with the average yield per mu reaching 1,200 kilograms. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“From Beidou navigation high-horsepower tractors to ride-on rice transplanters, from high-load plant protection drones to self-propelled corn combine harvesters, advanced machinery is an important equipment basis for storing grain and technology. &quot;Ye Xingqing, director of the Rural Economic Research Department of the Development Research Center of the State Council, said. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;At present, the comprehensive mechanization rate of crop cultivation and harvesting in the country has reached 73%, and the harvesting of staple grain crops has basically been mechanized. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Secure China’s seeds and ensure food security from the source. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Specialized high-quality wheat, high-amylose corn, water-saving and drought-resistant rice... Not long ago, at the 20th National Seed Fair held in Hefei City, Anhui Province, new and high-quality products from more than 350 seed industry companies were presented. Varieties appear one after another. From &quot;satisfying quantity&quot; to &quot;improving quality&quot;, seed industry enterprises continue to make efforts in breeding and promotion around the current demand for seeds for agricultural production. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“After long-term efforts, my country’s seed industry science and technology is generally at the world’s advanced level.” said Wan Jianmin, academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering and director of the National Crop Variety Approval Committee. At present, the coverage rate of improved crop varieties in my country is more than 96%, the area of ​​independently bred varieties accounts for more than 95%, and the contribution rate of improved varieties to agricultural production is more than 45%. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;New agronomic techniques are reaching the fields to help farmers grow more and better food. Recently, a thousand-acre corn high-yield demonstration farm in Zhaijia Town, Linyi County, Shandong Province has had a good harvest. The yield test results showed that the yield per mu reached 1,000 kilograms. &quot;From sowing to harvesting, at least eight or nine technologies are used in a piece of land.&quot; said Pang Linmeng, head of the Zhaijia Town Agricultural Technology Station. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Sending technology to the fields and providing services to villages, more than 500,000 agricultural technology extension personnel across the country play an irreplaceable role in ensuring food supply and increasing production and income. &quot;The agricultural technology extension system is the main force in promoting agricultural technology progress.&quot; Cui Jianghao, director of the Technology Promotion Division of the Department of Science and Technology Education of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, said that we will continue to strengthen the training and ability improvement of agricultural technology extension talents, implement detailed job responsibilities, and implement inclusive policies. Village-linked household mechanism to explore more pragmatic and effective service models. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>; &lt;b>;Promote green production methods and strive to develop ecological agriculture&lt;/b>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Green is the background of agriculture. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Since this year, various regions and departments have accelerated the promotion of green agricultural production methods, strived to develop ecological agriculture, promoted the conservation and efficient use of resources, and continuously enhanced the market competitiveness and sustainable development capabilities of grain and important agricultural products. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Currently, the proportion of green, organic, and geographically indicated agricultural products in my country reaches 12%, and the pass rate of routine monitoring of agricultural product quality and safety is 97.6%. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Reducing inputs and increasing efficiency, green production has become a new trend in the field. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;In Shengping Village, Wuliming Town, Zhaodong City, Heilongjiang Province, the harvested cornfield is covered with straw. Speaking of the experience of green grain planting, Shao Chunyu, chairman of the Yuyan Corn Planting Professional Cooperative, said: &quot;We coat the seeds before sowing, apply slow-release fertilizer to extend the fertilizer effect, and adopt a no-till sowing protective tillage mode, so that the crushed straw can still be broken. Fields. From planting to harvesting, intensive farming not only saves planting and fertilizer, but also increases the average yield per mu by 10%.&quot;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&quot;Farmland has been greened, and new results have been achieved in the green and efficient development of agriculture.&quot; Rural Development Research of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences Yu Fawen, a researcher at the institute, said. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Currently, various regions are working hard to promote green inputs, clean production methods, and resource utilization of agricultural waste, and the entire green industry chain of food production is accelerating. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Last year, the fertilizer utilization rate of the country&#39;s three major food crops, rice, wheat and corn, reached 41.3%, an increase of 1.1 percentage points from 2020; the coverage rate of unified prevention and control was 43.6%, an increase of 1.2 percentage points from the same period last year. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Develop ecological planting and breeding, and the output benefits will continue to increase. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“Co-cultivation of rice and crabs achieves dual uses of water and dual harvests in one field.” Ren Zhiguo, chairman of Yingtai Agricultural Machinery Farmers Professional Cooperative in Daguan Village, Datun Town, Zhenlai County, Jilin Province, said that every hectare of rice field It produces 9 tons of rice, and a pound of high-quality rice sells for 15 yuan to 20 yuan. Using the &quot;enterprise + cooperative + farmer&quot; model, local income from rice field crabs per hectare can be increased by about 7,000 yuan. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Stabilize grain and promote fishing, and increase the income of rich farmers. The relevant person in charge of the Fisheries and Fisheries Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs said that in recent years, the integrated rice and fishery planting and breeding industry has developed rapidly, making positive contributions to ensuring food security and the supply of aquatic products, increasing farmers&#39; income, and promoting rural revitalization. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;With intensive processing, the grain industry chain will continue to extend. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;In the production workshop of Feitian Biotechnology Co., Ltd., Qixian County, Henan Province, the wheat entering the green processing chain is ground and intensively processed: first, it is processed into flour and bran, and 25% of the tail powder is processed into starch, Wheat gluten products, crystallized fructose and other high value-added products can also be obtained through further transformation. &quot;Every grain of wheat is fully utilized,&quot; said Dong Deping, general manager of the company. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;To comprehensively promote rural revitalization, we must secure the initiative in food security. In the new era and the new journey, under the strong leadership of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core, all regions and departments and hundreds of millions of farmers are working hard together, rolling up their sleeves and working hard to improve production capacity, quantity and quality, and production ecology. If we catch it, the jobs of the Chinese people will surely become more secure. &lt;/p>;&lt;!--/enpcontent-->;</description><pubDate> Sat, 28 Oct 2023 05:56:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[01版要闻 - 陕西稳步推进高质量发展（高质量发展调研行）]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://paper.people.com.cn/rmrb/html/2023-10/28/nw.D110000renmrb_20231028_5-01.htm]]><description> &lt;div>;Saturday, October 28, 2023&lt;/div>; &lt;!--enpcontent-->;&lt;p>;There are many &quot;origins&quot; in the 800-mile Qinchuan River.

Compared with 2020, the number of high-tech enterprises in Shaanxi has doubled in 2022, and the national ranking has steadily improved. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, General Secretary Xi Jinping has visited Shaanxi many times to provide guidance for Shaanxi’s development and point out the way forward for Shaanxi in the new era. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“In promoting Chinese-style modernization, Shaanxi must have the ambition and courage to be at the forefront of the times, strive to catch up, dare to surpass, and play an exemplary role in the western region.” General Secretary Xi Jinping’s message The earnest entrustment encouraged the cadres and masses of Shaanxi Province to regard innovation as the first driving force for development and steadily promote high-quality development. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Industrial innovation: seize traditional advantages and promote transformation and upgrading&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The No. 2 mine of Shaanxi Xiaobaodang Mining Co., Ltd. is located in Shenmu City, Yulin, Shaanxi Province, underground In a 300-meter-deep mining area, shearers can mine 2,500 tons of coal every 40 minutes. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;In the dispatch center on the ground, staff can accurately command &quot;big machines&quot; such as shearers, loaders, and transport planes to operate efficiently with the tap of a button. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“If you don’t go down the well, you will know what’s going on underground. In the current mining area, there is no coal on the walls, no dust on the body, and no mud on the shoes.” Yang Zheng, chairman of Shaanxi Xiaobaodang Mining Co., Ltd. said, This &quot;smart coal mine&quot; integrates Internet, cloud computing, big data, artificial intelligence and other technologies, and can mine 13 million tons of raw coal every year. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Shaanxi is rich in energy, and the energy industry is a traditional advantageous industry. &quot;We give full play to our energy advantages, insist on doing a good job of &#39;stability, control and transformation&#39;, and shoulder the responsibility of ensuring energy supply security.&quot; Wen Zhigang, deputy director of the Shaanxi Provincial Development and Reform Commission, explained -&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&quot;Stability&quot; is Stabilize coal, expand oil, and increase gas simultaneously to release high-quality production capacity;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&quot;Control&quot; means strictly controlling the blind development of &quot;two high&quot; projects;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&quot;Transfer&quot; means accelerating the development of coal The chemical industry is undergoing a high-end, diversified, and low-carbon transformation and development, and at the same time, the &quot;capital&quot; earned from traditional energy is invested in new energy and non-energy industries. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;In 2022, Shaanxi&#39;s raw coal, crude oil, and natural gas output will rank among the top in the country; its coal chemical industry has made great progress, and its coal-to-olefins, coal-to-ethylene glycol, and coal tar production capacity will lead the country. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“Accelerate the high-end, intelligent, and green upgrading of traditional industries, cultivate and expand strategic emerging industries, and actively develop the digital economy and modern service industries.” General Secretary Xi Jinping’s important instructions have laid a solid foundation for the modernization of Shaanxi. The industrial system points the way. Today, Shaanxi&#39;s strategic emerging industries such as semiconductors, photovoltaics, and new energy vehicles are developing rapidly. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;At the end of 2022, the conversion efficiency of the silicon heterojunction battery independently developed by Longi Green Energy Technology Co., Ltd. reached 26.81%. &quot;It is not easy to improve this indicator by 0.01 percentage points every time. This technological breakthrough is of great significance to the development of the photovoltaic industry.&quot; Liu Yuxi, the person in charge of LONGi Green Energy, said, &quot;Since 2012, we have invested a total of more than 200 RMB in research and development expenses. billion.&quot;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;In Xi&#39;an Future Artificial Intelligence Computing Center, the goal is &quot;computing power.&quot; As the first large-scale artificial intelligence computing power cluster in the west, it can perform 3 billion quadrillion half-precision floating-point calculations per second, which is equivalent to the simultaneous operation of 1.5 million high-performance computers. Driven by &quot;computing power&quot;, the ancient city of Xi&#39;an is accelerating its development in the field of artificial intelligence. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The integration of the digital economy and the real economy will consolidate the foundation of the real economy. Today, Shaanxi leads the world in the production of monocrystalline silicon wafers and heavy-duty truck transmissions, and the production of new energy vehicles ranks among the top in the country; digital industrialization and industrial digitization are entering the fast lane, and the scale of the digital economy accounts for more than 30% of the regional GDP. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Recently, Shaanxi has added three new key industrial chains with an output value of over 100 billion yuan: coal-to-olefin aromatics, solar photovoltaics, and passenger vehicles (new energy vehicles). &quot;We want Shaanxi&#39;s economy to be in better shape and stronger while growing taller,&quot; said Zhao Yide, Secretary of the Shaanxi Provincial Party Committee. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Transformation of results: out of the laboratory and onto the production line&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“Over the past 20 years, I have made three attempts without success. I did not expect that 70 I accomplished it after I came out of the profession at the age of 10!&quot; Zhao Yuqing, a retired professor at Xi&#39;an Jiaotong University, lamented that after 5 years of retirement, he looked at the pile of award certificates and patent certificates in his study covered with dust, and he felt unwilling to do so. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The turning point came in 2021, when Shaanxi launched the construction of Qinchuang Original New Drive Platform. The old professor was willing to come out because he had two &quot;reassurances&quot;: one was the ion beam amorphous carbon-based superhard film technology that he had studied for half his life; the other was the new regulations on the reform of the long-term use rights of professional scientific and technological achievements. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;For a period of time, job-related scientific and technological achievements have been state-owned assets, and many scientific researchers have been afraid of transferring them. Shaanxi is rich in science and education resources - 111 universities, 1,814 scientific research institutions, and millions of professional and technical talents. However, it is difficult to transform the rich scientific research results. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“We must deploy the innovation chain around the industrial chain, lay out the industrial chain around the innovation chain, and take greater steps to promote high-quality economic development.” General Secretary Xi Jinping’s important instructions provide guidance for Shaanxi to accelerate the industrialization of scientific and technological achievements. direction. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;In order to open up the channel for “liquidating” scientific and technological achievements into cash, in March 2022, Shaanxi carried out “three reforms” pilots in 75 colleges and universities—separate management of job-related scientific and technological achievements and evaluation of technology transfer talents. And professional title evaluation, horizontal scientific research project surplus funds are invested in the transformation of scientific and technological achievements, and we work together to solve the problems of &quot;dare not transfer&quot;, &quot;don&#39;t want to transfer&quot; and &quot;lack of money to transfer&quot;. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“It feels like ‘the ties are loosened’, and my long-cherished wish has come true.” Zhao Yuqing said. His projects have landed in Xixian New District and settled in Qinchuangyuan. He has successfully &quot;broken into&quot; the aerospace, automobile, electronics and other industries and is very popular in the market. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;At the beginning of this year, on the basis of pilot projects, Shaanxi introduced 10 measures to deepen the transformation of scientific and technological achievements into &quot;three reforms&quot;. Up to now, more than 53,000 job-related scientific and technological achievements in Shaanxi have been managed separately, more than 12,000 achievements are being transformed, and 317 people have been promoted to professional titles based on their contribution to transformation of achievements. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The &quot;three reforms&quot; have relieved the worries of scientific researchers, and the Qin Chuang principle has set up a stage for innovation and entrepreneurship - clear positioning: &quot;the largest incubator in the province&quot; and a &quot;special zone&quot; for the transformation of scientific and technological achievements, the general window Located in Xixian New District and Western Innovation Port. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“Scientific research results, in order to take the first step of ‘getting off the bookshelf and putting them on the shelves’, require multi-faceted and three-dimensional guarantees.” In the view of Li Li, deputy director of the Qinchuang Original Innovation Promotion Center, financial support is particularly important. The key; the &quot;matchmaking&quot; of technology brokers who understand technology, industry, market, and management is also crucial. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;In 2022, the transaction volume of technology contracts in Shaanxi Province will exceed 300 billion yuan, ranking sixth in the country. Qin Chuangyuan’s technology brokerage team at the general window of Xixian New Area currently has 158 people providing “full chain services”. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Green base: People live up to the green mountains, and the green mountains will definitely live up to people&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The Qinling Mountains, the &quot;central water tower&quot; that unites the north and south and covers the world, winds The nine-mile Yellow River, the Han River, the largest tributary of the Yangtze River that meanders eastward... spans the two major basins of the Yellow River and the Yangtze River, and the Qinling Mountains traverse Shaanxi from east to west, with beautiful mountains and rivers. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“Shaanxi’s ecological and environmental protection is not only related to its own development quality and sustainable development, but also related to the overall ecological environment of the country.” General Secretary Xi Jinping’s important instructions have inspired Shaanxi to stay committed to the construction of ecological civilization. . &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Do you want a &quot;quilt&quot; for the hillside, or a &quot;ticket&quot;? A few years ago, there was a big question mark in the minds of some people in northern Shaanxi. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The confusion lies in the fact that on the Loess Plateau, there were once desolate mountains and windy and sandy sky. &quot;You can plant a slope in spring and harvest a bag of grain in autumn. If you plant more trees, there will be no food.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After more than 20 years of returning farmland to forests, the high loess slopes have been &quot;dressed in green&quot;. The green vitality of northern Shaanxi gives farmers their first taste of &quot;nature&#39;s kindness.&quot; However, the Yellow River Basin in Shaanxi is still a relatively fragile ecological area - the green here is &quot;light green&quot; rather than &quot;dark green&quot;. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Today, Shaanxi people are moving towards &quot;dark green&quot;. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;On the bank of the Yellow River, in the Shanxi-Shaanxi Gorge in Yichuan County, Yan&#39;an City, the mountains are steep, the soil is poor, and it is difficult to plant trees. In order to &quot;leave no inch of barren hills&quot;, Yichuan adapted measures to local conditions and created the afforestation method of &quot;rock pits and soil for large seedlings&quot; - building stone pits on slopes, deploying soil from elsewhere, and planting large saplings that are not easily eaten by rabbits. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Hao Yunfeng, director of the Yichuan County Forestry Bureau, said that since 2012, Yichuan has used this method to &quot;gnaw the hardest bones&quot; and has afforestation of a total of 37,000 acres. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Vegetation restoration, soil and water conservation, comprehensive management of mountains, rivers, forests, fields, lakes, grass and sand... Shaanxi has implemented a &quot;combination punch&quot; to push the green territory 400 kilometers northward, and the annual amount of yellow sediment has been significantly reduced. In 2022, among the 65 state-controlled sections in the Yellow River Basin in Shaanxi, 93.8% of the water quality sections are Class I to III, and the overall water quality has reached excellent for the first time. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Deep in the Qinba Mountains, the three cities of Hanzhong, Ankang and Shangluo are the main water sources for the middle route of the South-to-North Water Diversion Project. The annual inflow of water from the Han River and Danjiang River accounts for 70% of the Danjiangkou Reservoir. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The shadow of the sun is floating on the waves, the mist is dyed green by the lotus, and the water birds are gathering. Tianhan Wetland Park is the &quot;back garden&quot; of Hanzhong citizens. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;In recent years, in order to coordinate urban development and ecological protection of the Han River, Hanzhong City has controlled water with an iron fist, protected water with affection, and made people familiar with the water. It has transformed the old &quot;dirty and messy&quot; wasteland into a new garden. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;In order to ensure that &quot;a clear water flows northward forever&quot;, Shaanxi has handed over a new answer sheet: in 2022, the water quality of the 46 state-controlled sections in the Yangtze River Basin in Shaanxi will all reach Category II or above, with a 100% excellent rate. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;With “the great nation” in mind, Shaanxi strives to be a good ecological guardian of the Qinling Mountains. Zhao Jiahong, deputy director of the Shaanxi Provincial Department of Ecology and Environment, said that the proportion of the area with &quot;excellent&quot; ecological environment quality in the Shaanxi section of the Qinling Mountains has increased to 99.3%. The goal of making the Qinling Mountains beautiful, green mountains and green waters long-lasting is becoming Reality. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Green mountains, peaceful rivers, and the land of Sanqin are laid with &quot;green content&quot;, giving birth to the &quot;gold content&quot; of high-quality development. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“People live up to the green mountains, and the green mountains will definitely live up to the people.” Zhang Junqi, deputy county magistrate of Luochuan County, Yan’an City, said, “People who have tasted the ‘green dividend’ will enjoy brand-new benefits in rural revitalization. life.&quot;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>; &lt;strong>;Opening breakthrough: creating an inland open highland and opening up a new world of development&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&quot;My hometown, Shaanxi, is located at the starting point of the ancient Silk Road . Standing here, looking back at history, I seem to hear the sound of camel bells echoing in the mountains, and see the curling smoke flying in the desert.&quot; In the autumn of 2013, President Xi Jinping first proposed the joint construction of the &quot;Silk Road Economic Belt&quot; when he visited Central Asia. &quot;initiative. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Times create opportunities, and opportunities create dreams. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;In the past 10 years, Shaanxi, which is not along the border, near the river or the sea, but located deep in the northwest hinterland, has followed the trend, taken advantage of it, deeply integrated into the overall pattern of jointly building the &quot;Belt and Road&quot;, and created an internal Mainland reform and opening up high ground, opening up a new world of development. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;On the yellow land, there is a big port, and the China-Europe freight train &quot;Chang&#39;an&quot; is running non-stop. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;A few days ago, with a crisp whistle, the &quot;Chang&#39;an&quot; photovoltaic train set off from Xi&#39;an. Taking the &quot;out to sea&quot; ride were 50 containerized photovoltaic modules from LONGi Green Energy, which arrived at their destination in Uzbekistan after a long journey. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“On the yellow land, a gentle ‘sea breeze’ is blowing.” Yuan Xiaojun, general manager of Xi’an Free Trade Port Construction and Operation Co., Ltd., introduced that the China-Europe freight train “Chang’an” currently operates 17 international trunk lines on a regular basis, basically covering The main sources of goods are Central Asia, South Asia, West Asia and Europe. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The &quot;Steel Camel Team&quot; rushes to the &quot;Belt and Road&quot; to provide surging momentum for Shaanxi&#39;s high-level opening up: In 2022, the number of China-Europe freight trains &quot;Chang&#39;an&quot; exceeded 4,600 for the first time, transporting 4.117 million tons of goods , the three key indicators of number of lines, freight volume and heavy container rate are among the best in the country. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The road becomes wider and wider, and the horizons become wider and wider. Shaanxi enterprises have opened up their minds and horizons, and continuously expanded the depth and breadth of opening up to the outside world. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;A while ago, Sun Dongbo, the regional general manager of Shaanxi Automobile Holding Group’s marketing area in Tajikistan, was very busy. &quot;At the beginning of the year, local customers had vehicle purchase plans, requiring special configurations and tight delivery times.&quot; Sun Dongbo was busy asking about demand and adjusting orders. &quot;I was relieved to hear that the customer was very satisfied.&quot;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;This year In the first eight months, Shaanxi Automobile Holding Group&#39;s export sales exceeded 36,900 vehicles, a year-on-year increase of more than 80%. Shaanxi Gu, Fast, Aiju Cereals and Oils... More and more Shaanxi local enterprises are actively exploring overseas markets and &quot;going out&quot;. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Taking the &quot;Belt and Road&quot; express train, Shaanxi opens up to the outside world at a high level, promotes reform, development, and innovation, and achieves mutual benefit and win-win results. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“Stand up to the forefront and strive to be the trend-setter of the times.” Today, Shaanxi is ushering in a critical moment when opportunities are stacked, advantages are bursting out, and factors are converging, and it is entering the fast lane of innovation leadership, opening-up breakthroughs, and catching up and surpassing. &lt;/p>;&lt;!--/enpcontent-->;</description><pubDate> Sat, 28 Oct 2023 05:56:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[01版要闻 - 国务院印发《关于开展第四次全国文物普查的通知》]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://paper.people.com.cn/rmrb/html/2023-10/28/nw.D110000renmrb_20231028_6-01.htm]]><description> &lt;div>;Saturday, October 28, 2023&lt;/div>; &lt;!--enpcontent-->;&lt;p>;Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 27th&amp;nbsp; Notice&quot; (hereinafter referred to as the &quot;Notice&quot;), decided to launch the fourth national cultural relics census in November 2023. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The &quot;Notice&quot; emphasizes that under the guidance of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, we must thoroughly implement the spirit of the 20th National Congress of the Party and conscientiously implement the Party Central Committee&#39;s instructions on adhering to protection first, strengthening management, exploring value, The work of effectively utilizing and bringing cultural relics to life requires careful organization and deployment to ensure that the census results comprehensively and objectively reflect the basic status of my country&#39;s immovable cultural relics resources. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The &quot;Notice&quot; pointed out that the overall goal of the census is to establish a general catalog of national immovable cultural relics resources, establish a national large database of immovable cultural relics resources, and establish a dynamic management mechanism for cultural relics resources.

&lt;strong>; 科学种植，提升品质&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;双手紧握，轻轻旋转，白绿相间的萝卜便出了土。凑近看，外皮光滑，根须甚少，几乎不见泥土。“&#39;拔出萝卜不带泥&#39;，知道为啥不？”菜棚主人是辛店镇石郭家村村民郭全，他说，“不光种质要好，菜棚子也是关键。”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;过去，临洮农民种菜多用竹片大棚。“又低又窄，钻进去直不起腰。”个头一米八的郭全没少吃苦头，“竹棚保温性差、没法机械作业，起垄高度不够，影响蔬菜品质。”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;几年前，郭全响应号召，将自家50个竹棚全部改造成钢架大棚。“每座大棚造价1.8万元，政府补贴1.55万元。”郭全说，改造后棚顶超3米，可以进机器，起垄高，垄上种萝卜、垄沟种叶菜，根系少、卖相好，“大棚延长了蔬菜的供应期，比露地蔬菜上市提早、延长1个月，一年四季能供应。”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;近5年，临洮累计投资2.17亿元，改造提升9200亩“老菜地”，建成双层全钢架塑料大棚5000余座、日光温室4830亩，发展设施蔬菜7万亩。“通过基础设施改造提升，&#39;一茬变多茬、平面变立体&#39;的现代高原蔬菜种植体系成形，蔬菜品质提升。”临洮县农业农村局局长杨天秀说。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;小心扒开松软潮湿的基质，移栽不久的脱毒百合种球露出“真容”。“外形圆润、色泽洁白，一年后就可以移栽大田。”说话的是甘肃省农科院生物技术研究所研究员林玉红，她在临洮马铃薯科技小院一扎就是5年。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“以前，鲜百合面临果实黄化、种性退化问题，产量和品质都受影响。”经过一番调研，林玉红决定从种球种源入手，做切片、送检验、查病毒，找到原因后又无偿提供技术，指导当地企业开展良种繁育。如今，林玉红的研究成果推广到临洮县一半以上种植百合的乡镇。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;近年来，临洮县与甘肃农业大学、中国科学院寒旱研究所等14所高校、科研单位合作，试验、示范和推广高原蔬菜新技术、新品种。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>; &lt;strong>; 延伸链条，适销对路&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“品质再好，卖不上价也白搭。”新添镇崖湾村党总支书记杨有义说，“十几年前，大家都是天不亮就往批发市场赶，挤破头抢位置，价格高低全看收购商脸色。”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;要想壮大产业，必须主动拥抱市场。杨有义带着村干部到山东寿光学习先进经验。随后，崖湾村开始搭建自己的购销平台，村里出地、公司集资，建设蔬菜批发市场，参加展会、吸引客商。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;鲜菜易腐、不耐贮运，仅拓宽销售渠道，还不足以抵御市场风险。“我们投资建设了果蔬保鲜库，延长产业链条。”杨有义介绍，如今崖湾蔬菜交易市场年交易量12万吨，交易额突破6000万元，带动村集体年收入超120万元。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;在临洮，沿212国道，每隔不远便能看见一座果蔬保鲜库。“近些年，县里在蔬菜产业集中的乡镇建成冷库129座，贮藏保鲜能力接近8万吨。”杨海燕说，有了冷库保鲜，农户就近形成蔬菜分选小市场，并通过社交媒体共享信息，根据市场需求定批定量组织生产，实现从“种啥卖啥”到“要啥种啥”的转变。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;高原蔬菜发展势头迅猛之时，临洮恒德源农业发展有限公司董事长王永兵进入新赛道，瞄准深加工。公司的车间里，通过蒸煮、断生、研磨、添加益生菌，3小时后，干净的百合剥片就成为百合饮品。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“我们能生产百合银耳莲子羹、百合原浆等多款产品。”王永兵深知，产业链条延得长、品牌也要叫得响，“我们注册了品牌，今年还和甘肃省博物馆合作推出文创项目，通过博物馆及电商平台进入更广阔的市场。”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;为拓展销售渠道，近年来，临洮县建成农业农村部定点市场2家，开办农产品交易市场15家，配套建成电商中心、产地仓、农特馆等电商平台企业23个，年均销售收入1200万元。同时，通过“定点市场+蔬菜基地+仓储保鲜+物流配送”的精准对接机制，年均向周边城市配送净菜10余万吨。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“目前，临洮高原蔬菜已初步形成标准化种植、采后分级分选、清洗包装、冷链储运、精深加工、电子商务、品牌孵化的全产业链发展模式，蔬菜加工转化率达到56%。”临洮县委书记许树德说，下一步将继续突出区域特色和优势品种，进一步做大做强高原蔬菜产业。&lt;/p>;&lt;!--/enpcontent-->;</description><pubDate> Sat, 28 Oct 2023 05:56:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[02版要闻 - 着力提高粮食综合生产能力（全面推进乡村振兴）]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://paper.people.com.cn/rmrb/html/2023-10/28/nw.D110000renmrb_20231028_3-02.htm]]><description> &lt;div>;2023年10月28日星期六&lt;/div>; &lt;!--enpcontent-->;&lt;p>;眼下正是秋粮收获季节，粮食安全是“国之大者”。习近平总书记强调，“实施乡村振兴战略，必须把确保重要农产品特别是粮食供给作为首要任务”“要始终把保障国家粮食安全摆在首位，加快实现农业农村现代化，提高粮食综合生产能力，确保平时产得出、供得足，极端情况下顶得上、靠得住”。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;牢牢守住粮食安全底线，今年以来，各地区各部门严格落实粮食安全党政同责，千方百计稳面积、提单产、增效益，全力夺取粮食丰收。农业农村部农情调度显示，目前全国秋粮已收获过八成，全年粮食生产有望再获丰收。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;b>;提质量、保数量、拓空间，粮食安全根基稳&lt;/b>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;今年以来，各地区各部门把提高农业综合生产能力放在更加突出的位置，切实加强耕地保护，全力提升耕地质量，稳步拓展农业生产空间，落实落细抗灾减灾措施，确保粮食任何时候都能产得出、供得上。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;提质量，提升农田抗灾减灾能力。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;东北黑土地稻谷飘香。“今年水稻亩产1200斤，涝灾没减产，高标准农田可帮了大忙了。”黑龙江省方正县天门乡水稻种植户张有国说，高标准农田项目区排灌系统完备，及时排水施肥，落细管护措施，产量得到保障。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;今年方正县实施4.71万亩高标准农田项目建设，提升农田抗灾减灾能力，进一步夯实粮食安全根基。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;各地区大力提高高标准农田建设标准和质量，项目区农田平均耕地质量提高约1个等级，亩均粮食产量一般增加10%至20%，抗灾减灾能力不断提高。截至去年底，全国累计建成10亿亩高标准农田，今年任务为新建4500万亩、改造提升3500万亩。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;保数量，守好护好“饭碗田”。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“秋收时节，我比平时要多巡两遍田。”一大早，山东省武城县老城镇后庄村“田长”、村党支部书记杨志立就忙活起来，“全村耕地1000多亩，我们悉心呵护良田，又迎来了一个丰收季。”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;目前武城县全面推行田长制，建立县、乡、村三级田长制体系，以行政村为基本单位划分网格责任区，全县设置“田长”453人，确保耕地保有量和永久基本农田面积不减少，牢牢守住耕地保护红线。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;织密耕地保护网，坚持良田粮用大原则，严格规范耕地占补平衡，稳妥有序落实耕地进出平衡，田长制已在26个省（区、市）落地生根。一系列耕地保护硬措施，不断夯实大国粮仓根基。今年全国粮食意向种植面积17.7亿亩以上，连续4年增加。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;拓空间，综合改造利用盐碱地。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;吉林省长岭县北正镇关山屯，原本寸草难生的盐碱地上多了一片“新绿”。中国科学院院士曹晓风团队来到长岭县，进行重度盐碱地改良与利用技术示范，根据盐碱地测产结果，预计每亩可产田菁干草620公斤。“专家下田改土就是不一样，重度盐碱地也能长出绿肥田菁来。”粮农叶树文说。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;盐碱地是耕地“提质、扩容、增效”的重要来源，各地充分挖掘盐碱地综合利用潜力，分区分类开展盐碱耕地治理改良。2020年以来，农业农村部在8个省份开展盐碱化耕地治理试点，3年累计实施240万亩次，项目区耕地质量平均提升0.11至0.51个等级，土壤含盐量平均降低约2‰。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;b>;强化农业科技支撑，新农艺助力种好粮&lt;/b>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;解决吃饭问题，根本出路在科技。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;各地区各部门以农业关键核心技术攻关为引领，以产业需求为导向，聚焦底盘技术、核心种源、关键农机装备等领域，不断强化农业科技支撑。目前，我国农业科技进步贡献率达到62.4%。乡亲们的“金扁担”越挑越稳。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;农机添动力，会种地变成“慧种地”。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“种地有了好帮手，更加心中有&#39;数&#39;。”四川省旺苍县白水镇卢家坝村种粮大户宋义先打开手机上的应用程序，查看收割机作业情况。今年，他家种的30多亩水稻依靠智能农机，实现精确播种、施肥、施药、灌溉和收获，亩均产量达到1200斤。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“从北斗导航大马力拖拉机，到乘坐式插秧机，从高负载植保无人机，到自走式玉米联合收获机，先进机械是藏粮于技的重要装备基础。”国务院发展研究中心农村经济研究部部长叶兴庆说。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;目前，全国农作物耕种收综合机械化率达到73%，主粮作物收获已基本实现机械化。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;攥牢中国种，从源头上保障粮食安全。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;专用优质小麦、高直链淀粉玉米、节水抗旱稻……前不久，在安徽省合肥市举办的第二十届全国种子双交会上，350多家种业企业的新优品种纷纷亮相。从“满足量”转向“提升质”，围绕当前农业生产用种需求，种业企业育繁推持续发力。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“经过长期努力，我国种业科技总体处于世界先进水平。”中国工程院院士、国家农作物品种审定委员会主任万建民说。目前，我国农作物良种覆盖率在96%以上，自主选育品种面积占比超过95%，良种对农业增产贡献率达45%以上。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;新农艺到田，助力农民种出更多更好的粮食。近期，山东省临邑县翟家镇千亩玉米高产示范方迎来好收成。测产结果显示，每亩产量达到1000公斤。“从播种到收获，一块地里至少用到了八九项技术。”翟家镇农技站负责人庞林猛说。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;送技到田，服务进村，全国50多万名农技推广人员在稳粮保供、增产增收等方面发挥着不可替代的作用。“农技推广体系是推动农业技术进步的主力军。”农业农村部科技教育司技术推广处处长崔江浩表示，接下来继续加强农技推广人才培养和能力提升，落实落细岗位责任，推行包村联户机制，探索更多务实管用服务模式。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>; &lt;b>; 推进绿色生产方式，努力发展生态农业&lt;/b>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;绿色是农业的底色。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;今年以来，各地区各部门加快推进农业绿色生产方式，努力发展生态农业，促进资源节约高效利用，不断增强粮食及重要农产品市场竞争力和可持续发展能力。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;当前，我国绿色、有机、地理标志农产品产量占比达到12%，农产品质量安全例行监测合格率为97.6%。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;投入品减量增效，绿色生产成为田间新趋势。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;在黑龙江省肇东市五里明镇胜平村，收割后的玉米地铺上了秸秆。说起绿色种粮经，禹艳玉米种植专业合作社理事长邵春禹说：“播种前给种子穿上包衣，施用缓释肥延长肥效，采用免耕播种保护性耕作模式，打下来的秸秆粉碎还田。从种到收精耕细作，不光省种省肥，亩均产量还增加10%。”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“农田增绿，农业绿色高效发展取得新成效。”中国社会科学院农村发展研究所研究员于法稳说。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;当前，各地着力推进投入品绿色化、生产方式清洁化、农业废弃物资源化，粮食生产绿色全产业链加快形成。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;去年，全国水稻、小麦、玉米三大粮食作物化肥利用率达41.3％，比2020年提高1.1个百分点；统防统治覆盖率43.6%，同比提高1.2个百分点。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;发展生态种养，产出效益不断增加。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“稻蟹共养，实现了一水两用、一田双收。”吉林省镇赉县大屯镇大官村英台农机农民专业合作社理事长任志国介绍，每公顷稻田产稻米9吨，一斤精品米卖到15元至20元。采用“企业+合作社+农户”的模式，当地每公顷稻田蟹可增收7000元左右。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;稳粮兴渔，富农增收。农业农村部渔业渔政管理局有关负责人介绍，近年来，稻渔综合种养产业快速发展，为保障粮食安全和水产品供给、促进农民增收和推进乡村振兴作出积极贡献。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;做好精深加工，粮食产业链不断延伸。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;在河南省淇县飞天生物科技有限公司生产车间，进入绿色加工链条的小麦，经过研磨和精深加工：先是加工成面粉、麸皮，25%的尾粉加工成淀粉、谷朊粉产品，进一步转化，还可获得小麦结晶葡萄糖和结晶果糖等高附加值产品。“粮头食尾、农头工尾，每一粒麦子都被充分利用。”公司总经理董得平介绍。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;全面推进乡村振兴，必须把牢粮食安全主动权。新时代新征程，在以习近平同志为核心的党中央坚强领导下，各地区各部门和亿万农民一起踔厉奋发，撸起袖子加油干，产量产能一起抓、数量质量一起抓、生产生态一起抓，中国人的饭碗必定越端越牢。&lt;/p>;&lt;!--/enpcontent-->;</description><pubDate> Sat, 28 Oct 2023 05:56:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[02版要闻 - 民航客运规模创季度新高]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://paper.people.com.cn/rmrb/html/2023-10/28/nw.D110000renmrb_20231028_4-02.htm]]><description> &lt;div>;2023年10月28日星期六&lt;/div>;
