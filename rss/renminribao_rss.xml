From the perspective of coordinating the overall strategy of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation and the world&#39;s major changes unseen in a century, General Secretary Xi Jinping deeply reviewed the great achievements made by the Communist Party of China in uniting and leading the people of all ethnic groups in the country through hard work over the past 74 years, and spoke highly of the hard-won achievements made this year. , exciting achievements, focusing on “there are still many risks and challenges on the way forward”, deploying major strategic tasks and putting forward clear work requirements, emphasizing: “We must strengthen our confidence, inspire our spirit, work together in unity, and continue to climb up and overcome obstacles. Overcome difficulties and move forward unswervingly towards the grand goal of building a strong country and rejuvenating the nation!&quot;&lt;/P>;&lt;P>;This year is the first year to implement the spirit of the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China. The international environment is turbulent and the domestic reform, development and stability tasks are arduous and arduous. Under the strong leadership of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at the core, we have firmly grasped the initiative in development and created remarkable achievements. From achieving a major and decisive victory in epidemic prevention and control, to leading the world&#39;s major economies in economic recovery, to the successful hosting of the Chengdu Universiade and the brilliant Hangzhou Asian Games... we have coordinated COVID-19 prevention and control and economic and social development, and coordinated development and security, actively promote sustained economic recovery, orderly advance the reform of party and state institutions, effectively respond to local flood disasters, actively promote opening up, technological innovation, and green development, and firmly safeguard national sovereignty, security, and development interests. my country&#39;s economy is generally recovering and improving, showing great resilience and potential in its wave-like development and tortuous progress, and has a long-term positive trend. The ship of socialism with Chinese characteristics has cut through the waves and moved forward indomitably, heading steadily towards a more magnificent voyage. &lt;/P>;&lt;P>;After seventy-four years of overcoming obstacles and setting sail for seventy-four years, our country has gone from poverty and poverty to a moderately prosperous society in all respects, and has embarked on a new journey to comprehensively promote the construction of a strong country and national rejuvenation with Chinese-style modernization. Especially in the past few years since the new era, the development process of the party and the country has been extremely unusual and extraordinary.

As long as we implement the decisions and arrangements of the Party Central Committee, accurately identify changes, respond scientifically, and proactively seek change, we will surely be able to open up a new world for career development, and the giant ship &quot;China&quot; will surely be able to cut through waves and move forward victoriously. &lt;/P>;&lt;P>;Comprehensively building a modern socialist country is a great and arduous undertaking. The brighter the future and the longer the road ahead, the more we must strengthen our confidence and inspire our spirit.

We must focus on promoting high-quality development, fully, accurately and comprehensively implement the new development concept, accelerate the construction of a new development pattern, focus on increasing macro-control, focus on expanding domestic effective demand, focus on stimulating the vitality of business entities, and continuously promote the continued improvement of economic performance and Endogenous power continues to strengthen, social expectations continue to improve, we will effectively prevent and resolve major risks, and strive to achieve the annual economic and social development goals.&quot;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;High-quality development is the primary task of comprehensively building a modern socialist country. After the epidemic prevention and control has stabilized, economic recovery has been a process of wave-like development and tortuous progress. Our country&#39;s economy has huge development resilience and potential, and its long-term positive fundamentals have not changed. It is necessary to look at China&#39;s economic development from a comprehensive, dialectical and long-term perspective, see through the short-term &quot;shape&quot;, clearly see the long-term &quot;trend&quot;, and understand the general logic of economic operation. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Look at the &quot;points&quot; and &quot;faces&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;The transformation and upgrading of an enterprise confirms the path of high-quality development of China&#39;s economy&lt;/strong>; &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Enterprises are the basic cells of economic activities. SAIC&#39;s transformation and upgrading path is a vivid epitome of the &quot;wave-like development and tortuous progress&quot; of China&#39;s economic recovery. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Sales of traditional fuel vehicles dropped by nearly 40% from 2.06 million to 1.24 million. In the past five years, SAIC Volkswagen’s sales have declined amid the tightening domestic fuel vehicle market. No. 63 Luopu Road, Anting Town, Jiading District, Shanghai is the location of SAIC Volkswagen’s oldest factory, Anting Plant 1, and the birthplace of the first Santana in China. In the field of fuel vehicles, SAIC Volkswagen was once a well-known leading company, and Santana has won the sales crown of a single domestic model for 22 consecutive years. From 2015 to 2018, SAIC Volkswagen has been the sales champion in the domestic passenger car market for four consecutive years, embarking on a beautiful upward curve. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The turning point occurred in 2018. This year, my country&#39;s automobile industry experienced negative growth for the first time in 28 years, with annual automobile sales falling by 2.8% year-on-year; SAIC Motor experienced a decline in non-net profits for the first time since its listing as a whole. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;In 2019, SAIC Group’s net profit hit a five-year low; in 2020, net profit dropped 20.2% year-on-year; in 2021, the automobile market picked up, with net profit increasing 20.08% year-on-year; in 2022, due to the epidemic and other factors As a result, net profit attributable to the parent company fell 34.3% year-on-year. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;SAIC is not the only one under pressure. my country’s traditional fuel vehicle industry is also facing challenges. The automobile industry is one of Shanghai&#39;s pillar industries. In 2020, when SAIC Group&#39;s performance declined, Shanghai&#39;s regional GDP growth also fell back to 1.7%. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Transformation must be painful, and upgrading is the way out. We must not only make a determination to reduce the volume of development and gradually reduce the production capacity of traditional fuel vehicles, but also invest a large amount of funds in scientific and technological research and development to embark on the path of electrification and intelligent transformation. &quot;The choice of the market has pointed out the direction. Even if there are pains, we must keep up with the trend of new energy, be brave and take the initiative to innovate.&quot; said the relevant person in charge of SAIC. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;High-quality development is a process, and we must continue to follow the path we have chosen. Despite performance pressure, SAIC Motor&#39;s R&amp;D investment has remained industry-leading in the past five years. In 2021 alone, SAIC&#39;s R&amp;D expenses will reach 19.668 billion yuan, a year-on-year increase of 46.83%. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;SAIC’s transformation and upgrading path is also a path of structural adjustment. In order to transform to new energy vehicles, SAIC Volkswagen closed its nearly 40-year-old Anting Plant 1 and invested 17 billion yuan in a new MEB new energy vehicle plant two kilometers away from the Anting Plant. Employees affectionately call this factory with an annual production capacity of about 300,000 vehicles the &quot;New No. 1 Factory.&quot; &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;After working in the automobile assembly line of Anting No. 1 Plant for 7 years, Liu Hao became a robotic arm operator at SAIC Volkswagen’s “New No. 1 Plant”. In the workshop, hundreds of robotic arms are busy and operating efficiently. The world&#39;s leading digital production technology is fully applied. New energy models such as ID.3, ID.4X, ID.6X are entering the market from here. Since July this year, SAIC-Volkswagen’s ID. family has achieved sales of over 10,000 vehicles for two consecutive months, becoming the monthly sales champion of joint venture electric vehicles. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;With patience, the transformation results are beginning to show. In the first half of this year, by optimizing the structure, reducing costs and increasing efficiency, SAIC Group achieved both revenue and net profit growth. As the &quot;Three-Year Action Plan for the Development of New Energy Vehicles&quot; continues to accelerate, SAIC&#39;s switch between new and old tracks is progressing smoothly. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Since the second half of the year, SAIC Group has made frequent transformation and upgrading actions - &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Investment has accelerated, and the construction of new new energy vehicle projects has accelerated: On July 2, SAIC Zhengzhou new energy vehicle power battery project Officially launched; on July 4, SAIC announced that it would build a new energy vehicle factory in Europe; on July 5, SAIC General Motors Dongyue Autoneng Gigafactory started construction. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Leading in innovation and starting reverse technology output: On July 27, SAIC Group signed a memorandum of understanding with the German Audi company. SAIC will make full use of its own technological advantages to join hands with Audi to accelerate the development of new electric models and start a joint venture car A new chapter in corporate development. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Buy ships and go to sea, and export business continues to grow: On August 29, CSSC Jiangnan Shipbuilding Company officially launched the first ocean-going car carrier (ro-ro ship) &quot;tailor-made&quot; for SAIC Group. Today, for every three Chinese cars sold overseas, one is made by SAIC. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Relying on strong technical strength and making good use of the results of transformation and upgrading, SAIC Group is based on domestic and international dual cycles to promote high-quality development. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;At the Chengdu Auto Show, the third smart electric vehicle LS6 built by SAIC Group Zhiji Automobile Co., Ltd. made its world debut. It can travel more than 350 kilometers in 10 minutes of charging, and orders quickly exceeded 13,000 units. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;At the Munich Auto Show, SAIC Group’s “Three New Energy Musketeers” were unveiled, with the fastest acceleration from 0 to 100 seconds in just 3.2 seconds. In the first eight months, SAIC&#39;s own brand MG sold a total of 150,000 units in Europe, a year-on-year increase of 1.5 times, making it the fastest-growing mainstream car brand in the country. Next year, SAIC MG&#39;s global annual sales will hit the one million mark, of which new energy vehicles will account for 30%. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“The continuous breakthroughs in core technologies have benefited from SAIC’s accelerated pace of electrification and intelligent transformation in recent years.” Zu Sijie, vice president of SAIC, said that during the “14th Five-Year Plan” period, SAIC plans to Invest 300 billion yuan in innovative fields such as smart electric and comprehensively transform into high-tech enterprises. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;From &quot;First Factory&quot; to &quot;New First Factory&quot;, SAIC Group&#39;s transformation and upgrading process confirms the path of high-quality development of China&#39;s economy. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Many domestic automobile companies have also grown up together. In the first half of this year, BYD broke into the ranks of the &quot;top ten global car companies&quot; for the first time with a total of 1.25 million new car sales. Driven by the transformation of intelligent new energy and &quot;ecological overseas expansion&quot;, Great Wall Motor&#39;s overseas sales increased by 80.2% year-on-year, a record All time high. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“The development of China’s automobile industry is driven by electrification, digitalization and mobile Internet technology, demonstrating its innovative strength.” Obermu, Chairman of the Board of Management of Volkswagen Group of Germany, said that Volkswagen Group will invest approximately 1,800 million yuan in the next five years. billion euros, involving electrification, digitalization, intelligence and other fields. &quot;The Chinese market is one of our key investment markets.&quot; &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The courage of state-owned enterprises, the courage of private enterprises to venture, and the courage of foreign companies to invest continue to add momentum and confidence to China&#39;s automobile industry. More and more innovations in automobile manufacturing come from China, the world&#39;s largest automobile market. In the first eight months, my country&#39;s new energy vehicle production and sales increased by 36.9% and 39.2% respectively year-on-year, and new energy vehicle sales accounted for 29.5% of total new automobile sales. At present, more than 60% of the world&#39;s new energy vehicles are produced and sold in China, and my country has become the world&#39;s largest automobile exporter. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;From an enterprise to an industry to the entire Chinese economy, high-quality development is a process of continuous structural adjustment, transformation and upgrading. In this process, new difficulties and challenges will continue to emerge, and we will become more determined in dealing with challenges one after another: China&#39;s economy has huge development resilience and potential, and its long-term positive fundamentals have not changed. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Look at “high” and “low”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Towards a high-quality development of the Chinese economy, we must not only run fast, but also run faster Be stable and run for a long time&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;In the first half of the year, my country&#39;s GDP grew by 5.5% year-on-year. Is this growth rate &quot;high&quot; or &quot;low&quot;? &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Economic development has its own laws. There are twists and turns in progress, and progress amid twists and turns. Only by maintaining a normal mind, being more calm, and being more determined can we understand the development essence contained in economic growth. This is even more true when looking at the Chinese economy, whose economic aggregate has reached a new level of 120 trillion yuan. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;When looking at &quot;high&quot; and &quot;low&quot;, we need to look at both quantity and volume. The same growth rate represents different growth components and qualities. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The &quot;5G+&quot; future factory project has been launched, and the value of cross-border e-commerce goods leaving the bonded zone has reached a new high. Jinhua Jinyi New District in Zhejiang is full of new trends in industrial development. &quot;Now for every one percentage point increase in the GDP of the new district, the scale of the new GDP will more than double what it was 10 years ago, and the economic development will be more significant and of higher quality.&quot; Chen Zhiping, deputy director of the Development and Reform Bureau of Jinhua City&#39;s Jindong District, told reporter. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Economic increment is the product of growth rate and base number. When the base is large enough, even if the growth rate seems to be slowing down, the actual increase will not only not decrease, but also increase. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“China, as the world’s second largest economy, has the same growth rate of 1 percentage point today, but its absolute increment is very different.” Wang Xiaosong, a professor at the School of Economics at Renmin University of China, calculated an account for reporters , my country&#39;s GDP will be approximately US$18 trillion in 2022, and the increment brought by 1 percentage point growth is roughly equivalent to 2.1 percentage points 10 years ago; compared with emerging economies, China&#39;s 1 percentage point growth growth, approximately equal to 5.3 percentage points in India. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Even if we only look at this year, 5.5% is not a low growth rate. Vertical ratio, 5.5% is not only faster than last year&#39;s 3% economic growth, but also faster than the 4.5% in the first quarter. Horizontally, China was still the fastest growing among major economies in the first half of the year. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Since the second quarter, international organizations and institutions such as the World Bank have raised their expectations for China’s economic growth this year. The World Bank predicts that China&#39;s economy will grow by 5.6% in 2023 and believes that China will bring impetus to world economic development. At the same time, there are also voices that pessimize China&#39;s economy. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The key is to maintain a normal mind in the face of &quot;tune up&quot; or &quot;speak down&quot; from the outside world. A normal mind is a kind of calm and firm confidence, and a normal mind is also a kind of patience and determination. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;If you look at economic growth with a normal mind, you will see that a growth rate of 5.5% is in line with the expected goal of &quot;gross domestic product growth of about 5%&quot; proposed in this year&#39;s &quot;Government Work Report&quot;. After the epidemic prevention and control has stabilized, many people are looking forward to retaliatory growth in China&#39;s economy. But in fact, in the past three years, the global economy has been deeply affected by the COVID-19 epidemic and the Ukraine crisis, and economic recovery requires a process. The same goes for China&#39;s economic recovery. A growth rate of 5.5% is not easy. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;At the same time, the higher the economic growth rate, the better. We must clearly understand the cycle and environment of economic operation, respect the inherent laws of economic development, and blindly pursue high growth rates regardless of objective reality. &quot;It&#39;s like an athlete whose body is still recovering. You can&#39;t expect him to break the 100-meter sprint record in a short time.&quot; Wang Changlin, vice president of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;It should also be noted that the current century-old changes are accelerating and the world economic recovery lacks momentum. Although the International Monetary Fund raised this year&#39;s global economic growth to 3.0% in July, it is still far lower than the average annual growth rate of 3.8% from 2000 to 2019. In such an environment, China&#39;s 5.5% growth rate continues to inject confidence and motivation into the world. Bolger Brende, President of the World Economic Forum, said that China has taken many correct measures to support economic growth and is full of confidence in China&#39;s economic growth prospects. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;When looking at “high” and “low”, we must not only see the growth of GDP, but also the gold content of growth. The same GDP means different connotations. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The 5.5% economic growth is a result of structural improvement and kinetic energy optimization. From the perspective of demand, economic growth has shifted from being mainly driven by investment and exports last year to mainly driven by consumption and investment this year. From the perspective of production, economic growth has shifted from being mainly driven by industry last year to being driven by both the service industry and industry. The contribution of the service industry has increased significantly. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The 5.5% economic growth is growth driven by innovation and transformation of development methods. In the first half of the year, the added value of the information transmission, software and information technology services industry increased by 12.9%, and the online retail sales of physical goods increased by 10.8%. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The 5.5% economic growth is a growth that expands employment and improves people’s livelihood. In the first half of the year, the per capita disposable income of residents across the country actually increased by 5.8%, which was significantly faster than that of the previous year. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Looking at &quot;high&quot; and &quot;low&quot;, China&#39;s economy must not only run fast, but also run steadily and for a long time. The same GDP shows different resilience. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Strive for independent innovation. On August 15, iFlytek officially released version 2.0 of the Spark Cognitive Model. Liu Qingfeng, chairman of iFlytek, said that the company has cooperated with Huawei to create a new base for general artificial intelligence to promote independent control of the core technology of domestic large models. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Embrace the green wave. Since the beginning of this year, the cumulative sales of Cyrus new energy vehicles have exceeded 60,000 units. &quot;New energy vehicles have become an important driving force for the &#39;green&#39; and sustainable development of China&#39;s economy.&quot; said Zhang Xinghai, chairman of Thalys Automobile. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;In the first year, all regions and departments coordinated development and security and accelerated the construction of a new development pattern. The security of food, energy, and industrial chain supply chains was consolidated, and green development momentum was abundant. While promoting the improvement of the quality of economic development, At the same time, we will accelerate the transformation of growth momentum. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“The security and sustainability of economic development have been significantly enhanced, which is one of the highlights of China’s economy worthy of attention this year.” Wang Xiaosong said that a series of data show that China’s current economy is highly resilient and will continue to maintain Healthy and stable growth. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Since the second quarter, some indicators such as exports, investment, employment, and corporate profits have not seemed so impressive. How to treat? &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The slowdown in world economic and trade growth will inevitably increase downward pressure on my country’s foreign trade exports, which will in turn affect employment and corporate profits. &quot;China&#39;s economic recovery has hit a decline in global aggregate demand. This is an objective fact.&quot; said Guan Tao, global chief economist at BOC Securities. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“Currently, the international market demand is declining, and many domestic manufacturers have a wait-and-see attitude towards investment, so there will inevitably be some fluctuations in orders.” said Zhang Qunfeng, general manager of Ningbo Zhenzhi Machinery Mold Co., Ltd. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;At the same time, new changes are taking place in the export structure. In the first half of the year, my country’s import and export growth rate to countries co-building the “Belt and Road” was close to double digits, and the “three new” products (electric passenger vehicles , lithium batteries, solar cells) total exports increased by 61.6%. In the first eight months, my country&#39;s automobile exports increased by 104.4%, and ship exports increased by 28%. &quot;With the continuous efforts of a series of policies and measures, we have the confidence, foundation and conditions to achieve the goal of promoting stability and improving the quality of import and export.&quot; said Lu Daliang, director of the Statistical Analysis Department of the General Administration of Customs. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;As for investment, in the first half of this year, national fixed asset investment increased by 3.8% year-on-year, of which private fixed-asset investment fell by 0.2% year-on-year. Constrained by factors such as declining performance of some companies and unstable market expectations, stabilizing investment does face certain pressures. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;At the same time, it should also be noted that the impact of real estate market adjustments is one of the important reasons for the decline in investment growth. If real estate development investment is excluded, in the first half of the year, private project investment increased by 9.4% year-on-year, 5.6 percentage points higher than all investment. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Recently, various regions and relevant departments have successively introduced optimization measures such as &quot;recognizing houses but not loans&quot; and adjusting the minimum down payment ratio of housing loans to support residents&#39; rigid and improved housing needs. After the policy was introduced, the market responded positively. According to a survey by market institutions, the overall willingness to purchase houses nationwide can increase by about 15 percentage points, and the increase will be even higher in first-tier cities. &quot;As the real estate market adjustment and optimization policies and measures take effect and the economy recovers, real estate investment, sales, and market operations will gradually improve in the next stage.&quot; Fu Linghui, spokesperson of the National Bureau of Statistics, said. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;It is advisable to take a broad view of the scenery. &quot;Economic operation cannot be a straight line.&quot; Wang Changlin analyzed that the recovery in the post-epidemic period is in stages, especially in the process of transition from social repair to economic and profit repair, and then to balance sheet repair, some indicators appear Volatility, indicator tweaks, and expected fluctuations are the norm. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The resilience, patience and determination of the Chinese people are part of the Chinese national spirit. Maintain resilience, patience and determination, not be troubled by temporary economic fluctuations, face complex difficulties and challenges, and firmly hold the initiative of development in your own hands. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Look at “big” and “strong”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Towards a high-quality development of the Chinese economy, we must pay attention to both size and quality. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;When studying the general trend of economic development, we must be good at grasping the principal contradictions and the main aspects of them. At present and in the future, the main contradiction in China&#39;s economic operation is structural rather than aggregate, and the main aspect of the contradiction lies on the supply side. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Although my country&#39;s economic aggregate ranks second in the world, there is still a problem of being &quot;big&quot; but not &quot;strong&quot;. From the stage of high-speed growth to the stage of high-quality development, today&#39;s Chinese economy must pay attention to both size and quality. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;统筹质与量，实现由“大”向“强”，是发展的必答题，也是高质量发展的攻坚题。必须看到，当前中国经济发展需要量的合理增长，但也不能简单以国内生产总值增速论英雄，更不能为了经济增长不顾质量效益和生态环境。我们要更加关注经济结构调整，看看经济增长的成色到底如何。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;上海西北部，总投资5亿元的汽车元宇宙产业园，本是个二手车交易市场，腾笼换鸟，探索将元宇宙技术引入汽车的关键技术研发等环节。 “借助元宇宙技术，我们对汽车零部件进行3D建模，效率比传统工艺提高了20倍以上。”园区企业中恒创科（上海）工业智能科技有限公司项目总监杨筱雯说。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;投资是连接供给与需求两端的关键变量，高质量投资正成为推动高质量发展的重要先导力量。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;从传统基建到新基建，从传统制造业到高技术产业，我国投资结构持续优化，持续推动经济质量变革、效率变革、动力变革。前8月，高技术产业投资增长11.3%，科学研究和技术服务业投资增长22.3%，创新驱动发展作用不断增强。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;智能机器人忙碌在生产流水线上；AGV智能小车自动传输于生产工位之间……这个高度智能化的“未来工厂”，为德意智家公司发力高端品牌建设提供了强大技术支持。 “一期工厂产能是之前的4倍，人力却减少了约2/3，信息化、数字化升级为我们带来前所未有的发展机遇。”德意智家董事长高德康告诉记者。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;产业升级是高质量发展的重要支撑，越来越多企业把发展着力点放在数字化转型、技术改造等领域。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;由“大”向“强”，今天的中国经济，正在高质量发展中蝶变。上半年，我国产业升级稳步推进，工业生产技术密集程度持续提高，高端制造业增长较快，半导体器件专用设备制造业、电子元器件及机电组建设备制造同比分别增长30.9%和46.5%。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;黑黝黝的煤炭打成细小煤粉，在数千摄氏度高温下催化、挤压，转为气态，又凝成液体，生产出数十种工业产品。宁东能源化工基地里，一块煤被“吃干榨净”，价值大增。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;从按吨卖煤炭到按克卖化工品，因煤而兴的宁东华丽转身。 “度过转型发展阵痛期，就迎来新生与活力。”宁东管委会经济发展局局长田彦虎告诉记者，告别“靠煤吃煤”的传统发展路径，宁东正着力培育清洁能源等三大战略性新兴产业，上半年基地单位GDP能耗、单位工业增加值能耗分别下降7.8%、9%。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;完整、准确、全面贯彻新发展理念，以新发展理念“指挥棒”立起高质量发展“风向标”。越来越多地方像宁东一样，在转型之路上不断塑造发展新优势。上半年，中国经济绿色转型成效明显，与经济增长协同作用增强，新能源汽车、太阳能电池产品产量分别增长35%、54.5%，单位GDP能耗同比下降0.4%。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;在平常心中更能认清机遇和优势。 “从国际经验来看，在经济体量达到一定规模后，产业升级和转型发展一般都伴随着短期增速放缓。中国经济在加快结构调整和转型升级的同时，实现了质的有效提升和量的合理增长，殊为不易。”中国宏观经济研究院研究员杨长湧表示，利用好内需潜力巨大等优势，持续在转方式、调结构、增动能上下更大功夫，建设强大而有韧性的国民经济循环体系，中国经济能够实现更大突破、迈上更高台阶。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;看“稳”和“进”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;迈向高质量发展的中国经济，稳的基础更加牢固，进的动能更加充沛&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;当前，美欧国家正经历几十年来少见的高通胀，一些发展中国家则受到债务困扰。反观中国，物价保持平稳运行，经济社会大局稳定。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;全球经济充满不确定性的当下，宏观稳定才是稀缺资源。中国经济发展，既要保持一定的增速，避免陷入中等收入陷阱，不能像一些高速增长的经济体那样大起后出现大落；也要防止急躁冒进，把长期目标短期化、系统目标碎片化。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“稳”和“进”辩证统一、互为条件。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;物价“稳”，拓展了“进”的空间。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;河南省郑州市万邦农产品物流城，一辆辆满载着萝卜、白菜等新鲜蔬菜的货车驶入交易区。 “肉蛋粮、果蔬货量充足，供应稳定。”物流城企宣负责人余保健说。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;今年以来，我国核心CPI（居民消费价格指数）涨幅基本稳定，物价始终保持平稳运行，千家万户的好日子稳稳当当。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;然而，CPI的阶段性回落也让一些人担忧，中国经济会不会陷入通缩？ &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“物价涨幅受多方面因素影响，不应简单将物价涨幅暂时为负与通货紧缩画等号。当前无论是经济增长还是货币供应量，都不符合通缩的典型特征。”管涛认为，对于CPI阶段性回落，既要重视总需求不足等问题，着力扩大内需，更要看到物价稳定保障了基本民生，为实施“以我为主”的货币政策创造了条件，提供了更多“进”的空间。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;事实上，历史上我国也曾多次出现CPI阶段性下行现象，均未明显影响宏观经济运行总体走势。 8月份，CPI同比涨幅已转正，环比上涨0.3%，释放经济运行回暖信号。 “综合物价水平、需求恢复、经济增长、货币供应量等因素判断，中国经济不存在所谓的通缩，后期也不会出现通缩。”国家发展改革委副主任丛亮说。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;消费“稳”，增强了“进”的动力。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;好商品不愁卖。 8月29日，华为Mate系列手机累计发货量达到1亿台，当日开售的最新机型Mate&amp;nbsp;60&amp;nbsp;Pro热销。这样的业绩，是在二季度全球智能手机市场同比下降10%的情况下取得的。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;好供给有磁力。 “这个夏天几乎都住在电影院了。”今年电影暑期档好片不断，让北京市朝阳区资深影迷王先生直呼过瘾。国家电影局统计数据显示，电影暑期档总票房创下中国影史同期最高纪录。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;今年上半年，最终消费支出对经济增长的贡献率达到77.2%，“主引擎”动力更加强劲。前8月，社会消费品零售总额同比增长7%，服务零售额增长19.4%，服务消费对于整个市场的带动作用非常明显。 “下阶段，居民就业总体稳定，企业效益逐步改善，有利于居民增收，提升消费能力和消费意愿。加之促消费政策继续显效，消费持续增长态势总体稳定，有利于经济恢复。”付凌晖说。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;就业稳，提升了“进”的成效。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;毕业前夕，西安电子科技大学本科生袁俊豪顺利签约科大讯飞公司。以人工智能、算力为代表的新兴领域人才需求快速升温，据该校就业指导服务中心统计，八成以上的签约毕业生到信息技术产业、科学研究与高端装备制造业就业。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;今年需要在城镇就业的新成长劳动力1662万人，规模创近年新高，就业能否持续稳住？ &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;近日，拥有4000余名员工的中建二局华东公司，收到了上海市人社部门发放的70多万元稳岗返还资金。 “钱直接打到公司账户，这对我们稳定用工有很大帮助。”公司人力资源部经理董彦成说。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;降低失业和工伤保险费率政策延续至2024年底，落实创业担保贷款和贴息政策，实施百万就业见习岗位募集计划……在一系列措施综合作用下，上半年全国城镇新增就业678万人，同比增加24万人。 “随着经济持续恢复，用工需求继续扩大，加上稳就业政策持续显效，就业保持总体稳定有较好支撑。”付凌晖说。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“就业是民生之本，而经济发展的最终目的是保障和改善民生。”王昌林说，只要在保障和改善民生的同时逐步提高发展质量效益，经济增速高一点低一点都可以接受。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;信心与平常心，来自干事创业的进取心。当前，中国经济复苏基础还不稳固，推动经济持续回升向好还需加力，必须坚持稳中求进工作总基调，推动高质量发展积蓄更大力量、站上更高台阶。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;稳预期。减半征收个人所得税、减半征收资源税、免征城镇土地使用税……近期，财政部等部门发布一系列公告，明确延续优化多项税收优惠政策，进一步稳定经营主体预期。 “税费红利增强了我们的创新动力，公司已经先后投入220多万元用于汽车模具表面自动研磨抛光技术等研发项目。”豪尔沃（山东）机械科技有限公司财务总监庄红艳说。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;强信心。设立民营经济发展局，举办2023年中国国际服务贸易交易会，新一轮国企改革深化提升行动拉开帷幕……以改革促发展、向开放要活力，鼓励企业敢闯、敢投、敢担风险。广大民营企业积极参与“5G+”“东数西算”等重要领域项目，与国家战略、地区发展“同频共振”。 8月，制造业采购经理指数（PMI）持续回升，制造业生产指数、新订单指数和服务业商务活动指数、业务活动预期指数均处于景气区间，为下阶段经济持续回升奠定良好基础。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;挖潜力。内需是我国经济发展的基本动力，也是加快构建新发展格局的战略基点。七部门联合印发工作方案促进汽车消费，新增专项债发行使用节奏加快……一系列稳投资、促消费的政策接连出台。 “把促进有效投资和消费的各方面积极因素充分调动起来，就能够进一步释放中国经济的发展潜能，推动高质量发展不断取得新成效。”王孝松说。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;更要看到，制度优势是中国经济攻坚克难的底气所在。 “我们有以习近平同志为核心的党中央的坚强领导，有社会主义市场经济的体制优势，有宏观调控的充足工具和政策空间，有防范化解风险的丰富手段和措施，中国经济将在应对困难挑战中行稳致远。”王昌林说。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;咬定目标不放松，敢闯敢干加实干。中国经济高质量发展的光明前景，来自每一个人的奋斗与创造。 “波浪式发展、曲折式前进”的动力，蕴藏在上汽集团迎难而上的转型升级中，蕴藏在科大讯飞坚持不懈的自主创新中，蕴藏在宁东基地求新求变的结构调整中……从全局谋一域，以一域服务全局，发挥好各自在大局中的优势、机遇中的优势、比较中的优势，以“钉钉子精神”在实干中“积跬步以至千里”。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;在实干中更好地去创造方法、谋划思路。最新公布的中国经济“8月报”显示，当前主要经济指标延续恢复向好态势。鼓足干事创业的精气神，形成狠抓落实的好局面，我们有信心、有条件、有能力完成全年经济社会发展目标任务，以新作为推动高质量发展取得新成效。 &lt;/p>;&lt;!--/enpcontent-->;

&lt;!--enpcontent-->;&lt;P>;业绩都是干出来的，真干才能真出业绩、出真业绩。近日，习近平总书记在浙江考察时对树立正确政绩观提出明确要求，强调要“坚持干在实处、务求实效”。&lt;/P>;&lt;P>;新时代以来，党和人民一道拼、一道干、一道奋斗，攻克了许多长期没有解决的难题，办成了许多事关长远的大事要事，创造了一个个令人刮目相看的人间奇迹。新时代的伟大成就充分表明，空谈误国，实干兴邦；社会主义是干出来的，新时代是奋斗出来的。中国式现代化是前无古人的开创性事业，需要我们不断探索创新。这对各级党组织和领导干部的素质能力提出了新的更高要求，对我们的精神状态、作风形象提出了新的更高要求。我们靠实干创造了辉煌的过去，还要靠实干开创更加美好的未来。面对新形势新任务，党员干部只有胸怀“国之大者”，聚焦问题、知难而进，务实功、出实招、求实效，以“时时放心不下”的责任感、积极担当作为的精气神为党和人民履好职、尽好责，依靠顽强斗争打开事业发展新天地，才能为推进强国建设、民族复兴作出应有贡献。&lt;/P>;&lt;P>;习近平总书记强调：“一分部署、九分落实。不注重抓落实，不认真抓好落实，再好的规划和部署都会沦为空中楼阁。”干在实处，关键就在于以钉钉子精神抓部署、抓落实、抓督查，不获全胜决不收兵。广大党员干部要清醒认识到，干事担事，是干部的职责所在，也是价值所在。党把干部放在各个岗位上是要大家担当干事，决不能坐而论道、光说不练。无论是建设现代化产业体系，还是全面推进乡村振兴；无论是加快实施创新驱动发展战略，还是积极稳妥推进碳达峰碳中和，实现每一项目标任务，都需要付出百倍努力，来不得半点虚功。要狠抓落实，一切工作都要往实里做、做出实效，坚决杜绝口号式、表态式、包装式落实的做法，以真抓的实劲、敢抓的狠劲、善抓的巧劲、常抓的韧劲，把党中央决策部署落到实处。要强化精准思维，做到谋划时统揽大局、操作中细致精当，以绣花功夫把工作做扎实、做到位。&lt;/P>;&lt;P>;业绩好不好，要看群众实际感受，由群众来评判。务求实效，就要把为老百姓办了多少好事实事作为检验政绩的重要标准，以群众满意不满意作为根本评判标准。要坚持问题导向，聚焦实践遇到的新问题、改革发展稳定存在的深层次问题、人民群众急难愁盼问题、国际变局中的重大问题、党的建设面临的突出问题，不断提出真正解决问题的新理念新思路新办法，不断通过化解难题开创工作新局面。要突出效果导向，紧紧围绕新时代新征程党的中心任务，不断提高推动高质量发展的系统性、整体性、协同性，把惠民生、暖民心、顺民意的工作做到群众心坎上。形式主义、官僚主义，是阻碍党的路线方针政策和党中央重大决策部署贯彻落实的大敌。要把纠治形式主义、官僚主义摆在更加突出的位置，不做表面文章，不耍花拳绣腿，不搞贪大求洋、盲目蛮干、哗众取宠，不搞华而不实、投机取巧、数据造假，努力创造经得起历史和人民检验的实绩。&lt;/P>;&lt;P>;大道至简，实干为要。新征程是充满光荣和梦想的远征，没有捷径，唯有实干。让我们更加紧密地团结在以习近平同志为核心的党中央周围，深刻领悟“两个确立”的决定性意义，坚决做到“两个维护”，牢固树立和践行正确政绩观，不驰于空想，不骛于虚声，以愚公移山的志气、滴水穿石的毅力真抓实干、埋头苦干，一步一个脚印把党的二十大作出的重大决策部署付诸行动、见之于成效。&lt;/P>;&lt;!--/enpcontent-->;</description><pubDate> Sat, 30 Sep 2023 05:56:06 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[02版要闻 - 释放旅游消费潜力推动旅游业高质量发展]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://paper.people.com.cn/rmrb/html/2023-09/30/nw.D110000renmrb_20230930_4-02.htm]]><description> &lt;div>;2023年09月30日星期六&lt;/div>;
