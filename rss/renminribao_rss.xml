Determined to put forward high expectations for the CIIE to better play its functional role, it has injected strong positive energy into promoting the construction of an open world economy and promoting the recovery of the world economy. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Holding the China International Import Expo is a major decision made by China to promote a new round of high-level opening up to the outside world. It is a major initiative for China to open its market to the world. The purpose is to expand opening up and let China expand. The market has become the world&#39;s great opportunity. Since 2018, the CIIE has been successfully held for five times. Relying on China&#39;s large market advantages, it has given full play to its functions as a platform for international procurement, investment promotion, cultural exchanges, and open cooperation, and has made positive contributions to accelerating the construction of a new development pattern and promoting world economic development. The world&#39;s first import-themed national exhibition, which was personally planned, proposed, deployed and promoted by President Xi Jinping, has become a window for China to build a new development pattern, a platform for promoting high-level opening up, and a platform for global sharing. international public goods. With the theme of &quot;New Era, Shared Future&quot;, this year&#39;s CIIE has a record number of Fortune 500 companies and industry leading companies participating in the expo, which will surely provide more market opportunities, investment opportunities, and growth opportunities for all parties, and gather strength. Promote development together. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Openness is a distinctive symbol of contemporary China. This year marks the 45th anniversary of reform and opening up. Promoting reform and development through opening up is an important magic weapon for my country&#39;s modernization drive to continuously achieve new achievements. Especially since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, China has implemented a more proactive opening-up strategy, built a high-standard free trade zone network for the world, accelerated the construction of free trade pilot zones and Hainan Free Trade Port, and jointly built the &quot;Belt and Road&quot; as a deep-seated Popular international public goods and international cooperation platform. my country has become a major trading partner of more than 140 countries and regions, ranking first in the world in terms of total trade in goods, leading the world in attracting foreign capital and overseas investment, forming a larger-scale, wider-field, and deeper opening-up pattern. In the past 10 years, China&#39;s average annual contribution to world economic growth has exceeded 30%. Since the beginning of this year, China&#39;s economy has maintained a rebounding trend. China has the institutional advantages of a socialist market economy, the demand advantage of a very large-scale market, the supply advantage of a complete industrial system, and the talent advantage of a large number of high-quality workers and entrepreneurs. China&#39;s economy is highly resilient, has great potential, and is full of vitality. Its long-term positive fundamentals have not changed. It has made outstanding contributions to ensuring the safe and smooth flow of industrial and supply chains and promoting the steady and solid progress of the world economic recovery. Practice has fully proved that China&#39;s continuous expansion of opening up to the outside world has not only developed itself, but also benefited the world. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Currently, changes in the world, the times, and history are unfolding in an unprecedented way. The world&#39;s economic recovery lacks momentum and requires all countries to work together and seek common development. We must deeply realize that the world economy will prosper if it is open, and will decline if it is closed. Opening up is an important driving force for the progress of human civilization and the only way for world prosperity and development. Only by using openness to relieve development difficulties, using openness to gather the power of cooperation, using openness to gather the momentum of innovation, and using openness to seek shared benefits, and promote economic globalization continuously forward, can we enhance the development momentum of all countries. Humanity is an interdependent community with a shared future. Only by always adhering to win-win cooperation, striving to make the &quot;cake&quot; of mutually beneficial cooperation bigger, and jointly building an open and inclusive world economy can development results benefit people of all countries more and more equitably. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;When the world is good, China will be good; when China is good, the world will be better. China is comprehensively advancing the great cause of building a strong country and rejuvenating the nation with Chinese-style modernization. Adhering to peaceful development, seeking its own development while resolutely safeguarding world peace and development, using its own development to better safeguard world peace and development, and promoting the construction of a community with a shared future for mankind are the outstanding features of Chinese-style modernization. We open our doors and welcome anyone who wants to cooperate with us. As a super-large economy, China will always be an important opportunity for world development. It will promote all countries to share opportunities in China&#39;s large market, share opportunities for institutional opening up, and share opportunities for deepening international cooperation; it will firmly promote high-level opening up and expand market access. , create a first-class business environment that is market-oriented, rule-by-law, and international; we will always adhere to true multilateralism, promote the construction of an open world economy, and continue to promote economic globalization toward a more open, inclusive, universally beneficial, balanced, and win-win situation. direction of development. As President Xi Jinping hopes, the CIIE will &quot;accelerate the improvement of its window function in building a new development pattern, provide new opportunities for the world with China&#39;s new development; give full play to its role as a platform to promote high-level opening up, and make China&#39;s big market a big market shared by the world.&quot; market; better provide internationally shared international public goods and services, help promote the construction of an open world economy, and allow win-win cooperation to benefit the world.&quot; It will surely become an important way to smooth the domestic and international dual cycles and firmly promote the process of high-level opening up in China. play a greater role and make greater contributions. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Capitalize on the general trend of history and take the right path in the world. In today&#39;s world, the historical trend of peace, development, cooperation and win-win is unstoppable, the people&#39;s yearning for a better life is unstoppable, and the desire of all countries to achieve common development and prosperity is unstoppable. History has repeatedly proven that openness, inclusiveness, and win-win cooperation are the right path in the world. If all countries join hands to build more consensus on openness and jointly overcome difficulties and challenges, the spring breeze of openness will surely warm the world and bring a new bright future to global development. &lt;/p>;&lt;!--/enpcontent-->; &lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https:// feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 06 Nov 2023 05:56:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[01版要闻 - 在深学细悟笃行中汲取奋进力量（学思想 强党性 重实践 建新功）]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://paper.people.com.cn/rmrb/html/2023-11/06/nw.D110000renmrb_20231106_6-01.htm]]><description> &lt;div>;Monday, November 6, 2023&lt;/div>; &lt;!--enpcontent-->;&lt;p>;Since the launch of the second batch of thematic education on studying and implementing Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, various localities have insisted on &quot;learning ideological &quot;As the primary task, we should closely integrate our own reality, take multiple measures to promote it, and strive to focus on deepening, internalizing, and transforming, and promote party members and cadres to draw strength from in-depth study, careful understanding, and sincere practice. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;All localities firmly grasp the general requirements of thematic education, give full play to their own advantages, and promote theoretical learning into the brain and heart. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;On the basis of intensive reading of the required readings for further study, the Hebei Shijiazhuang Municipal Party Committee also used books such as &quot;Let the Masses Live a Good Life - Xi Jinping&#39;s Zhengding Footprints&quot; as vivid teaching materials for &quot;learning ideas&quot;.
