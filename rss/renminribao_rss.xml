The current world economic recovery is difficult. As President Xi Jinping pointed out, maintaining the resilience and stability of global industrial and supply chains is an important guarantee for promoting world economic development. Consolidating and strengthening cooperation in global industrial and supply chains is the interest and urgent expectation of all parties. China holds the Chain Expo in order to comply with the call of the times and create an international platform that promotes all parties to strengthen communication, deepen cooperation, and seek common development. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Li Qiang pointed out that history and reality have proven that when global industrial chain and supply chain cooperation remains stable and continues to deepen, countries around the world will generally benefit; when global industrial and supply chain cooperation is hindered and stagnant, , countries around the world are generally suffering. China is not only a participant and beneficiary of global industrial and supply chain cooperation, but also a staunch defender and builder. China is willing to work with all parties to make the global industrial and supply chains more resilient, efficient and dynamic, and make greater contributions to promoting world economic recovery and global development and prosperity. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Li Qiang put forward four initiatives on deepening international cooperation in industrial and supply chains: First, jointly build a safe and stable industrial and supply chain. Strengthen the coordination of resources in key industrial chains on a global scale and refrain from interfering in market behavior at will. China will continue to provide the world with high-quality Chinese products and stable Chinese supplies. The second is to jointly build a smooth and efficient industrial and supply chain. Further strengthen global interconnection and make elements circulate more conveniently and be allocated more efficiently. China will continue to promote high-quality cooperation in building the Belt and Road Initiative and strengthen innovative cooperation in areas such as intelligent manufacturing and digital economy. The third is to jointly build an open and inclusive industrial and supply chain. We will take a clear-cut stand against protectionism and various forms of &quot;decoupling and chain breaking&quot;, and at the same time strive to promote the green and low-carbon transformation of industrial and supply chains. China will integrate more deeply into the global industrial and supply chain system and actively participate in international cooperation in the field of green development. The fourth is to jointly build a mutually beneficial and win-win industrial chain and supply chain. Promote the construction of a global industrial chain and supply chain system in which all countries participate extensively, complement each other&#39;s advantages, and share dividends. China will actively promote industrial and production capacity cooperation with other countries and drive developing countries to participate more deeply in the global value chain. It is hoped that entrepreneurs from all countries will play an active role in promoting the stable operation of global industrial and supply chains.

After the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge, it once again connects the east and west sides of the Pearl River Estuary, and will provide the key to the &quot;A&quot;-shaped main traffic skeleton of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area. &quot;One horizontal line&quot;. When it opens to traffic next year, the journey from Shenzhen to Zhongshan will be shortened from two hours to less than 30 minutes. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;On the morning of November 28, as the last truck of concrete was poured, the 24-kilometer-long main line of the Shenzhen-Zhongshan Channel was fully connected. Across vast expanse of blue water, the &quot;hands&quot; stretched out from Qianhai, Shenzhen and Ma&#39;an Island, Zhongshan, finally held together tightly after 7 years. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>; &lt;strong>; &quot;Langjian Luozi&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Two artificial islands connect bridges and tunnels to achieve rapid traffic conversion&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt; p>; Starting from Zhongshan Ma&#39;an Island, the project nodes of the Shenzhen-Zhongshan Channel from west to east include Zhongshan Bridge, Lingdingyang Bridge, West Artificial Island, Undersea Tunnel and East Artificial Island, and are connected to the Shenzhen section of the Guangzhou-Shenzhen Coastal Expressway under construction. . &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;How can vehicles safely drive into the undersea tunnel from the Lingdingyang Bridge, which is dozens of meters away from the sea? The West Artificial Island, which is shaped like a kite and is pulled by the &quot;kite string&quot; of Lingdingyang Bridge, solves this problem. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The construction of this &quot;kite&quot; started in December 2016. It is the first child of the Shenzhen-Zhongshan Channel to fall in the Lingding Ocean. &quot;The most important function of the West Artificial Island is the bridge-tunnel conversion.&quot; said Huang Qingfei, chief engineer of the Tunnel and Underground Engineering Department of the China Communications Construction Highway Planning and Design Institute. &quot;Cars get off the bridge and drive through the West Artificial Island into the immersed tube tunnel under the sea. .&quot;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;How long will it take to build an artificial island with an area of ​​about 137,000 square meters, equivalent to 19 standard football fields, in the vast sea? The answer is four and a half months. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“57 steel cylinders with a diameter of 28 meters, a height of 35 meters to 40 meters, and a weight of more than 600 tons were sunk into the seabed, which is equivalent to forming an enclosure wall, and then filled with sand inside. The main structure construction on the island.&quot; Zheng Weitao, deputy chief engineer of the Shenzhen-Zhongshan Channel Project Department of CCCC First Harbor Engineering Co., Ltd. said that because the West Artificial Island is located in the sand mining area and has complex strata, the steel cylinder cannot be vibrated smoothly using conventional equipment and technology. In place, the construction team independently developed a 12-hammer linkage hammer group, which vibrated at the same frequency to &quot;knock&quot; giant steel cylinders bit by bit into the seabed rock formations on the sea foundation, setting a record for rapid island construction. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The immersed tube tunnel hidden into the seabed from the west artificial island emerges from the east artificial island located on the south side of Shenzhen Baoan Airport. This is also the gateway project at the Shenzhen end of the Shenzhen-Zhongshan Corridor. Previously, this was a shoal, and the island filled with sea sand covers an area of ​​343,800 square meters, equivalent to 48 standard football fields. This is the first underwater highway interchange in China. It adopts the &quot;one body and two wings&quot; layout. There are four ramp tunnels under water. One side is connected to the submarine immersed tube tunnel, and the other side is connected to the Guangzhou-Shenzhen Yanjiang Expressway and other road networks. Smooth connection. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The problem lies in interconnection. &quot;We are going to build an island under the Guangzhou-Shenzhen Yanjiang Expressway and fill in more than 3 million cubic meters of sea sand. The displacement and settlement of the piers of the Yanjiang Expressway caused by the island construction construction shall not exceed 5 millimeters.&quot; China Railway Tunnel Bureau Deep Middle Channel Project Dong Baohu, deputy director of the Ministry of Engineering, said that during the construction of the main line tunnel, the 18-meter-deep foundation pit excavated was only 1.17 meters away from the closest point to the existing bridge cap, which was &quot;dangerous and dangerous, and prudent.&quot; &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Problem solving also relies on technological innovation. &quot;In order to avoid excessive deviation of the existing bridge piers, we used ships to blow sea sand around the bridge piers. We first packed the sea sand into special bags, and then spread it evenly around the bridge piers layer by layer, solving the problem of deviation. load problem.&quot; Dong Baohu said that the construction team integrated CNC hydraulics, automated inspection and Internet of Things technologies, innovated process construction methods, and successively solved world-class common problems such as deep soft foundation, ultra-deep and ultra-wide foundation pit anti-seepage and water-proofing in the sea, and this year Construction of the main structure of the east artificial island was completed in June. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Today, the two artificial islands have become new landmarks of the Shenzhen-Zhongshan Channel. In the future, through the artificial island in the east, we can go east to Huizhou and Longgang District of Shenzhen, to the west to Zhongshan and Zhuhai, to the north to Guangzhou and Dongguan, and to the south to Shenzhen Qianhai and Hong Kong, making the Shenzhen-Zhongshan Corridor truly a hub project of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area. . &lt;/p>;&lt;p>; &lt;strong>; &quot;The Lead in the Wind&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;30 stories above the sea, the super-long-span bridge broke multiple records&lt;/strong>;&lt;/ p>;&lt;p>;Looking from afar, the Lingdingyang Bridge is majestic and erected on the main channel of Lingdingyang. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The upstream of the bridge is Guangzhou Port, the largest container trunk port in South China. There are more than 130 international container routes, and an average of more than 4,000 ships sailing on the Lingding Ocean under the bridge deck every day. In the future, there will be more Meet the navigation needs of 300,000-ton bulk carriers and 30,000-TEU container ships. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The busy navigation demand puts forward requirements for the clear navigation height of the bridge. To this end, the Lingdingyang Bridge adopts the world&#39;s largest fully offshore suspension bridge plan with a main span of 1,666 meters. The bridge deck is 91 meters above sea level, equivalent to a height of 30 stories, and the net navigation height reaches 76.5 meters. Chen Huanyong, engineer of the Shenzhen-Zhongshan Channel Management Center of Guangdong Communications Group, said: &quot;The clear navigation width of the main channel of Guangzhou Port is 1,520 meters. Taking into account the width of the main tower cap, anti-collision facilities, channel markings and other structures, we adopted a super-large span of 1,666 meters. Bridge.&quot;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The waters of the Pearl River Estuary are open and strong typhoons occur frequently. How can such a high bridge withstand the wind? &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“We organized many universities and scientific research institutions to carry out wind resistance research for more than three years, and developed a new combined aerodynamic control technology to significantly improve the wind resistance performance of long-span steel box girder suspension bridges.” Chen Huanyong said that the new technology solution has increased the critical flutter wind speed of the long-span steel box girder suspension bridge from the world-recognized 70 meters/second to 88 meters/second, &quot;which can withstand Category 17 typhoons.&quot; &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Looking from the bridge, the tall main tower looks like two gates, and the &quot;door pillars&quot; are firmly plunged into the seabed. Jin Wenliang, deputy director of the Chief Engineer Office of the Shenzhen-Zhongshan Corridor Management Center, said that the steel structure of the Lingdingyang Bridge uses about 85,000 tons of steel, which is equivalent to the amount of steel used in the two national stadiums &quot;Bird&#39;s Nest&quot;. To lift such a heavy bridge, It is necessary to build two bridge piers that are tall enough and a main cable with sufficient pulling force. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The two main towers are 270 meters high, equivalent to the height of a 90-story building. They are currently the tallest main towers of sea bridges in the world. The white main cable above the two main towers in the east and west has a diameter of 1.06 meters and is composed of more than 25,000 steel wires with a diameter of 6 mm. Each main cable has a cable force of more than 100,000 tons, which is equivalent to being able to withstand three medium-sized aircraft carriers at the same time. weight. &quot;Each tiny steel wire can lift three cars.&quot; Jin Wenliang said that this is a 2060 MPa galvanized aluminum steel wire independently developed by my country. It is also the main cable steel wire of a suspension bridge with the highest strength level in China. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;“Undersea Embroidery”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;“From 0 to 1”, build a 6.8-kilometer, two-way eight-lane undersea tunnel&lt;/strong>;&lt; /p>;&lt;p>;In the undersea tunnel that has just been completed, various construction vehicles are shuttled back and forth, and construction workers are &quot;finishing decoration&quot; in an orderly manner. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;In order to adapt to the technical characteristics of ultra-wide, widened, deeply buried, and large back-siltation of undersea tunnels, the construction team innovatively proposed a new structure of steel shell concrete immersed tube tunnel. This structure is the first large-scale application in the world, and China is facing a gap in the entire industry chain. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Among this 6.8-kilometer-long, two-way eight-lane undersea tunnel, the 5,035-meter-long steel-shell concrete immersed tunnel has become the most difficult project in the deep-medium tunnel. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“In 2018, we organized a team to go abroad to investigate and study the construction of immersed tube tunnels. The other party neither let us get close nor allowed us to take pictures. As a result, we learned nothing. But now we have created an overall level of It is far superior to the projects of international counterparts, and it is 100% independent intellectual property rights.&quot; Jin Wenliang sighed with emotion. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“From 0 to 1”, start research and development. The Shenzhen-Zhongshan Tunnel Management Center organized a number of domestic universities, scientific research institutes, construction design units, etc. to carry out systematic research on the entire industry chain for the construction of immersed tube tunnels, and successively conquered steel shell manufacturing, self-compacting concrete preparation, pipe section pouring, and inspection In order to solve problems such as floating installation and installation, we developed an intelligent manufacturing production line, innovatively developed an integrated immersed tube floating installation ship, and revolutionized the floating installation process of giant pipe sections. The speed and accuracy of floating installation set a record. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The immersed tube tunnel is composed of 32 pipe sections plus a final joint. It is sunk into the deep sea soft soil layer more than 30 meters below. Vehicles are equivalent to passing through the immersed tube. &quot;Each standard pipe section is 165 meters long and weighs about 80,000 tons. It is very difficult to connect them end to end in deep water.&quot; Song Shenyou, director and chief engineer of the Shenzhen-Zhongshan Channel Management Center, said that the installation of immersed pipes is equivalent to installing immersed pipes on the seabed. In needlework embroidery, &quot;Once the positioning is inaccurate or the accuracy is insufficient, resulting in excessive deviation in the installation of pipe sections, the entire project will have to be suspended.&quot; &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;How to make these big guys &quot;obediently&quot; &quot;find&quot; their place? &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;In June 2020, the world&#39;s first immersed tube floating installation integrated ship &quot;Yihang Jin&#39;an 1&quot; specially developed by the builder was officially launched. The 20,000-ton &quot;Yihang Jin&#39;an 1&quot; carried an 80,000-ton immersed tube and advanced slowly. It sailed nearly 50 kilometers into the designated sea area and began millimeter-level precision installation. &quot;We installed a Beidou satellite antenna on the measurement tower on the ship and used the Beidou navigation system to perform differential positioning of the immersed tube.&quot; said Ning Jinjin, executive deputy chief engineer of the Shenzhen-Zhongshan Channel Project Department of CCCC First Harbor Engineering Co., Ltd. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;In order to create a &quot;comfortable&quot; foundation bed for the immersed tube, the construction company of the Shenzhen-Zhongshan Tunnel developed an advanced immersed tube tunnel foundation trench gravel leveling ship &quot;Yihang Jinping 2&quot;. &quot;This boat is like an underwater &#39;3D printer&#39;. The flatness of the gravel layer can be controlled within plus or minus 4 centimeters.&quot; Ning Jinjin said. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Right now, the builders of the Shenzhen-Zhongshan Corridor are sprinting towards completion and opening to traffic in 2024: construction projects such as the fire rescue base and operation management center have started, and the construction of mechanical and electrical and ancillary projects is in full swing.
