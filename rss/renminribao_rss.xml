How China and the United States get along determines the future and destiny of mankind. Competition and confrontation are not in line with the trend of the times, and cannot solve the country&#39;s own problems and the challenges facing the world. China has always believed that the common interests of China and the United States far outweigh their differences, and that China and the United States&#39; respective successes are opportunities rather than challenges to each other. The &quot;Thucydides Trap&quot; is not inevitable. The vast earth can fully accommodate the respective development and common prosperity of China and the United States. The economies of China and the United States are deeply integrated, and we can benefit from each other&#39;s development. Global post-epidemic recovery, response to climate change, and resolution of international and regional hotspot issues all require coordination and cooperation between China and the United States. As two major countries, China and the United States should show the broad mind, vision and responsibility of major countries, handle Sino-US relations well, respect each other, peacefully coexist, and win-win cooperation in a responsible attitude towards history, the people, and the world, so as to enhance the mutual benefit of the two countries. people&#39;s welfare, promote the progress of human society, and contribute to world peace and development. &lt;/P>;&lt;P>;Xi Jinping pointed out that Chinese civilization has lasted for more than five thousand years and has always adhered to the concept of peace that keeps pace with the times, is inclusive, and cooperates and exchanges. China has created two miracles: rapid economic development and long-term social stability. It has historically solved the problem of absolute poverty and built a moderately prosperous society in all respects. The fundamental reason is that it has found a successful development path that is in line with China&#39;s national conditions, meets the people&#39;s expectations, and has the support of the people. China will continue to adhere to the path of socialism with Chinese characteristics, comprehensively promote Chinese-style modernization, unswervingly adhere to peaceful development, and work with other countries in the world to promote the building of a community with a shared future for mankind. We welcome more members of the U.S. Congress to visit China and better understand China’s past, present and future. It is hoped that the legislative bodies of the two countries will have more contacts, dialogues and exchanges to enhance mutual understanding and make positive contributions to the stabilization and improvement of Sino-US relations. &lt;/P>;&lt;P>;Schumer and others said that they were very happy to visit beautiful China and thanked China for its warm reception, which made us feel the vitality and potential of China&#39;s development through this trip. Schumer and others introduced their views and opinions on issues related to Sino-US relations, saying that the stable development of U.S.-China relations is not only crucial to the United States and China, but also related to world peace and development. China&#39;s development and prosperity are beneficial to the American people. The United States does not seek conflict with China and does not want to decouple from China. It is willing to strengthen dialogue and communication with China in the spirit of openness, candor and mutual respect, manage and control relations between the two countries responsibly, and promote the stable development of US-China relations. The United States looks forward to strengthening bilateral trade and investment cooperation with China and strengthening communication and cooperation on issues such as addressing climate change, combating drug trafficking, and resolving regional conflicts. &lt;/P>;&lt;P>;Wang Yi attended the meeting. &lt;/P>;&lt;!--/enpcontent-->;</description><pubDate> Tue, 10 Oct 2023 06:26:05 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[01版要闻 - 在加快数字化转型中塑造高质量发展新动能新优势]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://paper.people.com.cn/rmrb/html/2023-10/10/nw.D110000renmrb_20231010_4-01.htm]]><description> &lt;div>;Tuesday, October 10, 2023&lt;/div>; &lt;!--enpcontent-->;&lt;P>;Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, October 9th&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Premier of the State Council Li Qiang on October 7th Will be conducting research in Zhejiang on the 9th.

&lt;!--enpcontent-->;&lt;p>;在红海之滨、苏伊士运河之南，刚迎来15岁生日的中埃·泰达苏伊士经贸合作区（以下简称“合作区”）一片生机盎然：完善的基础设施、丰富的产业集群、先进的物流仓储、周到的生活配套……合作区加快推进战略升级，成为中埃两国企业投资合作的重要平台。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;2016年1月21日，习近平主席访问埃及期间，与埃及总统塞西共同为合作区二期揭牌。在中埃两国元首共同关心下，合作区已成为共建“一带一路”和“苏伊士运河走廊经济带”对接的示范项目，成为埃及和红海两岸工业现代化的一张崭新名片。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;“目前苏伊士运河走廊经济带最成功的项目”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;在合作区投资服务中心大楼的接待大厅，合作区二期的标识十分醒目、寓意丰富。写有中阿双语“中国·埃及苏伊士经贸合作区扩展区”字样的青花瓷盘上，由6个“田”字合围而成的埃及依米花图案，象征着合理规划的现代城区。瓷盘底座上雕刻着两条曲线，分别代表黄河和尼罗河，预示着在中埃两大文明共同滋养下，合作区蓬勃发展的光明前景。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;7年来，合作区二期建设不断取得新进展。埃及泰达特区开发公司执行董事宋彩岑介绍，合作区二期占地面积6平方公里，已有40家企业入驻，涵盖纺织、建材、摩托、家电制造等产业种类。2021年，合作区成功推动埃及境内首个中资保税仓项目正式运营，努力打造国际商品集散中心和汽车及零配件集散中心。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;经过两期建设，合作区已成为埃及目前综合环境最优、投资密度最大、单位产出最高、中资企业最集中的工业园区。140多家企业在此扎根，实际投资额超16亿美元，累计销售额超37亿美元，缴纳税费超2亿美元，直接解决就业近6000人，带动就业约5万人……合作区被塞西总统评价为“目前苏伊士运河走廊经济带最成功的项目”，埃及总理马德布利也称赞合作区是“埃及工业园区的典范”。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“我去过合作区多次，每次都有新发现，园区建设越来越好，企业越来越多。”苏伊士省省长萨克尔表示，合作区完备的配套设施、优惠的投资政策具有巨大的吸引力，“泰达是我们值得信赖的合作伙伴”。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;面向未来，合作区积极构建“一核心、双走廊、三基地”布局，促进园区内外联动，并与天津东疆综合保税区有效联通，着力培育一批竞争优势突出、带动能力强的龙头骨干企业，进而推动产业集聚和集群发展。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;“创造大量就业岗位，带动埃及制造业向前发展”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;在苏伊士运河经济区总局主席瓦利德·贾迈勒丁看来，在两国元首的共同擘画和推动下，合作区作为运河经济区乃至整个埃及的典范项目，有力推动了埃中经贸往来与投资合作。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;中国巨石股份有限公司（以下简称“中国巨石”）从2012年开始投资埃及，2013年底巨石埃及玻璃纤维有限公司（以下简称“巨石埃及”）一期项目年产8万吨玻璃纤维生产线建成投产。从一期到四期，巨石埃及玻纤生产基地年产能合计达34万吨，成为非洲大陆最大的玻纤生产基地。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;走进巨石埃及生产基地，生产线忙碌有序。偌大的工厂有2000多名工人、30多名中国管理和技术人员，大部分生产和管理岗位都由埃及本地人承担。在明晰的工作流程下，工人们认真完成来自世界各地的订单。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;看着眼前的蓬勃景象，谁能想到，10年前这里还是一片荒漠。巨石埃及总经理吴平说，中国巨石进入埃及之初，遇到的困难远超想象：电力供应紧张、审批速度缓慢、水资源紧缺……中方建设者迎难而上，与埃及各方积极开展互利合作。10年来，巨石埃及完成4条玻纤生产线和配套辅助项目建设，打造出中国在海外自主建设的首个大型玻纤生产基地，累计创造超16.7亿美元的出口创汇。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;巨石埃及还主动履行企业社会责任，包括加强环境保护、助力社区发展等，为当地的孤儿院和贫困居民提供力所能及的慈善救助，为非洲希望学校捐赠教学和生活物资。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;在马德布利看来，成功建成规模庞大的新生产线，体现了巨石埃及的实力。“中国巨石在埃及扩大投资的同时，创造大量就业岗位，带动埃及制造业向前发展。”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;“进一步推动研发、制造和人才的本土化”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;埃及“2030愿景”指出，埃及将积极参与国际经济合作，最大限度提高附加值，创造体面的和有产出的工作岗位，使实际人均国内生产总值达到中等收入国家水平。培养更多符合产业发展和时代需求的人才，是埃及工业现代化的重要目标之一。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;在合作区宽阔的道路两侧，一栋栋崭新的厂房整齐排列。走进美的埃及厨房和热水器有限公司的洗碗机工厂，工人忙碌的身影映入眼帘——有的在流水线上装配零部件，有的在调试机器设备，有的在中国师傅指导下学习新技术……中国企业到红海之滨投资兴业，不仅为当地民众带来更多优质产品，也培养了一批批善于钻研创新的技术人才。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“要仔细检查一下点焊机的电极位置，确保焊点大小一致。”中国师傅张鉴槐正与埃及徒弟谢哈布讨论着碗篮的焊接技术。张鉴槐在机器旁仔细观看，谢哈布认真地研究碗篮结构，不时调节电极高低、技术参数等。张鉴槐说：“碗篮焊接是技术难度比较高的工序，谢哈布认真好学，相信他一定能掌握这门技术，成为工厂的骨干。”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;公司总经理陈巍巍介绍，美的投资引进的碗篮生产线，填补了埃及洗碗机制造领域的技术空白，不仅培养了焊接技能人才，也推动了配料加工、浸粉工艺等关键技术的本土化，降低了洗碗机的成本和价格，让家电业本土化成果持续惠及普通民众。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;在流水线的另一端，底盘组装小组的负责人卡迈勒不停地查看工作进展，指导组员解决相关技术难题。2022年12月，作为首批员工，卡迈勒接受了入厂培训。“在中国师傅指导下，我学习了洗碗机生产的全流程，并且在流水线的每个环节都参与了实操培训。”卡迈勒说。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;经过3个月的系统培训，喜爱钻研的卡迈勒成为洗碗机流水线上的技术能手，不久前被任命为小组长，负责底盘组装工序。通过传帮带，一批又一批新员工在技术骨干的指导下，掌握了组装技能。“我非常高兴能来这里工作，我将不断努力，用自己的双手创造美好生活。”卡迈勒的微笑中流露出对职业生涯的憧憬。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;陈巍巍说，目前这条洗碗机流水线的产能可以满足中东地区市场需求，未来还将增加新的流水线，生产出更多新款洗碗机。“我们将进一步推动研发、制造和人才的本土化，并以当地用户市场为中心，为地区用户提供品类更丰富的家电产品。”&lt;/p>;&lt;!--/enpcontent-->;</description><pubDate> Tue, 10 Oct 2023 06:26:05 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[03版要闻 - 共同为促进全球互联互通做增量（和音）]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://paper.people.com.cn/rmrb/html/2023-10/10/nw.D110000renmrb_20231010_2-03.htm]]><description> &lt;div>;2023年10月10日星期二&lt;/div>;
