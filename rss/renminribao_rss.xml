Since the beginning of this year, as a number of railway projects such as the Guinan High-speed Railway, Sichuan-Qinghai Railway, Lixiang Railway, and Chengdu-Ziyi High-speed Railway have made new progress, the construction of railways in the western region has accelerated. Data show that from January to October, fixed asset investment in railway projects under construction in Chongqing, Sichuan and Guizhou was 84.46 billion yuan, a year-on-year increase of 20.23%. &lt;/P>;&lt;P>;How difficult is it to crack the &quot;hard nut&quot;? The Sichuan-Qinghai Railway transitions from the Chengdu Plain to the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and crosses active fault zones 11 times. It is listed by the design unit as one of the most difficult railways to repair in the country. Wang Xiaoguang, chief engineer of the China Railway 12th Bureau Project, said frankly that the Liutongzhai Tunnel was the most difficult tunnel he had ever participated in building. It is 16.4 kilometers long and took 5 minutes to pass by the train. The construction of the project took 10 years. &lt;/P>;&lt;P>;What’s the point of chewing on “hard bones”? Wang Xiaoguang said: &quot;The entire construction process requires taking two steps and taking one step back, but if you keep going, you can get out of the &#39;highway&#39; of external connectivity in the western region.&quot; The day before the opening of the Sichuan-Qinghai Railway, Liu Yongming, a 67-year-old resident of Maoxian County, Sichuan, gave a speech in Guangzhou My daughter sent a message: &quot;The high-speed train has arrived at my doorstep.
