My two meetings with King Norodom Sihamoni reflected the deep friendship between China and Cambodia as one family. Not long ago, I met with Prime Minister Hun Manai in Beijing and reached an important consensus on inheriting ever-lasting friendship and deepening comprehensive strategic cooperation. China cherishes its special friendship with the Cambodian royal family, attaches great importance to the development of China-Cambodia relations, and is willing to work with Cambodia to promote the construction of a community with a shared future between China and Cambodia to be deeper and more concrete. &lt;/P>;&lt;P>;Xi Jinping emphasized that this year marks the 10th anniversary of my proposing the concept of amity, sincerity, mutual benefit and inclusiveness. Sino-Cambodian relations embody this concept and China&#39;s policy of adhering to being good friends and partners with its neighbors. China supports Cambodia in taking a development path that suits its national conditions, supports Cambodia in achieving stability and development, and supports Cambodia in playing an important role on the international and regional stages. The two sides should maintain high-level exchanges, deepen mutually beneficial cooperation, solidly advance the &quot;Diamond Six-sided&quot; cooperation structure, promote the construction of the &quot;Industrial Development Corridor&quot; and the &quot;Fish and Rice Corridor&quot; to achieve visible results as soon as possible, and serve their respective countries&#39; modernization undertakings. Both sides should continue to promote exchanges and cooperation in education, culture, youth and other fields to make China-Cambodia friendship more deeply rooted in the hearts of the people. &lt;/P>;&lt;P>;Norodom Sihamoni said, I am very honored to lead the delegation to the beautiful Hangzhou to attend the opening ceremony of the 19th Asian Games. China has successfully hosted the Asian Games twice. I firmly believe that under the strong leadership of President Xi Jinping, China will once again present a wonderful sports event to the world and make new contributions to promoting the unity and friendship of the Asian family. The Cambodian people will always remember the brotherly friendship forged by King Norodom Sihanouk and Chinese leaders, cherish the iron-clad friendship established between Cambodia and China, and fully agree with the concept of amity, sincerity, mutual benefit and inclusiveness in neighboring diplomacy put forward by President Xi Jinping. Cambodia firmly adheres to the one-China policy and is willing to join hands with China to build the &quot;Belt and Road&quot; and build a Cambodia-China community with a shared future. I wish the friendship between Cambodia and China will last forever! &lt;/P>;&lt;P>;Cai Qi, Ding Xuexiang, Wang Yi, Chen Yiqin and others attended the meeting. &lt;/P>;&lt;!--/enpcontent-->;</description><pubDate> Sun, 24 Sep 2023 06:56:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[02版要闻 - 习近平会见尼泊尔总理普拉昌达]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://paper.people.com.cn/rmrb/html/2023-09/24/nw.D110000renmrb_20230924_3-02.htm]]><description> &lt;div>;Sunday, September 24, 2023&lt;/div>; &lt;TABLE width=&quot;100%&quot;>;&lt;TBODY>;&lt;TR>;&lt;TD align=&quot;center&quot;>;&lt;IMG width=&quot;100%&quot; src=&quot;http: //paper.people.com.cn/rmrb/images/1/20230924/1695506246977_1.jpg&quot;>;&lt;/TD>;&lt;/TR>; &lt;TR>;&lt;TD>;&lt;p>;On the afternoon of September 23, President Xi Jinping The West Lake State Guesthouse in Hangzhou met with Nepalese Prime Minister Prachanda, who was in China to attend the opening ceremony of the 19th Asian Games and pay an official visit. &lt;BR/>;Photographed by Xinhua News Agency reporter Ding Lin&lt;/p>;&lt;/TD>;&lt;/TR>;&lt;/TBODY>;&lt;/TABLE>; &lt;!--enpcontent-->;&lt;p>;This newspaper, Hangzhou, September 23&amp;nbsp ;&amp;nbsp;(Reporters Wang Hailin, Liu Junguo) On the afternoon of September 23, President Xi Jinping met at the West Lake State Guesthouse in Hangzhou with Prime Minister Prachanda of Nepal, who was in China to attend the opening ceremony of the 19th Asian Games and pay an official visit. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Xi Jinping pointed out that China and Nepal are connected by mountains and rivers and have been friendly from generation to generation.
