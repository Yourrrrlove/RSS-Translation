General Secretary Xi Jinping thinks in practice. &lt;/P>;&lt;P>;This symposium on promoting the comprehensive revitalization of Northeast China in the new era is not only an outline of the revitalization of Northeast China, but also a window for observing China&#39;s development. When talking about overcoming difficulties, the General Secretary said with emotion: &quot;Confidence is worth gold. As long as you have confidence, you can expect a bright future. In the new journey of building a strong country and rejuvenating the nation, Northeast China will surely be able to regain its glory, Let’s achieve great results again.”&lt;/P>;&lt;P>;“Of course we should not blindly pursue miracles, but we should keep a normal mind and grasp our own historical position. Don’t make extreme or emotional actions. Seeking medical treatment in a hurry. Those practices are of no benefit.&quot;&lt;/P>;&lt;P>;A normal mind is a calm and firm confidence. &lt;/P>;&lt;P>;“When the Party Central Committee looks at problems, it always looks at the big picture, and what is the most important mission of a place.” This passage from the General Secretary is an entry point for understanding China. &lt;/P>;&lt;P>;Be able to recognize opportunities and advantages more clearly in your ordinary mind. Only by judging the opportunities and advantages of a place can we better grasp the strategic positioning and historical mission of a place. From this perspective, we can have a deeper understanding of why in Northeast China we talk about &quot;firmly grasping the important mission of Northeast China in safeguarding the country&#39;s &#39;five major security&#39;&quot;; why in Xinjiang, the General Secretary proposed that &quot;if the Silk Road Economic Belt is built, Xinjiang will &quot;It may become a prosperous center&quot;; why go to Sichuan, focus on the construction of the country&#39;s &quot;rear area&quot;, and hope that &quot;this place will become a growth pole and a new source of power for high-quality development&quot;...&lt;/P>;&lt;P>;New In this era, the common opportunities and responsibilities and missions faced by all provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities are to build a strong country and rejuvenate the nation. Their respective advantages are advantages in the overall situation, advantages in opportunities, and advantages in comparison. &lt;/P>;&lt;P>;While inspecting Heilongjiang, General Secretary Xi Jinping heard someone talk about an incident: a young man was fishing leisurely by the river. When asked, he came to plant crops and was responsible for drone operations, which was completed that day. &lt;/P>;&lt;P>;In the past, when we were opening up wasteland, &quot;we would get up at 3:30 in the morning and come back to see the sky full of stars, gnawing on frozen steamed buns and eating snowflake soup.&quot; Nowadays, the scientific and technological quality of the farmland is sufficient, and the agricultural modernization of Northeast China is at the forefront of the country. &lt;/P>;&lt;P>;This is the advantage of Northeast China. With white mountains and black waters, there is vast space for agricultural modernization to show its talents. After seeing the advantages and comparing the overall situation, a normal mind will come naturally. &lt;/P>;&lt;P>;Consider a domain from the overall perspective and use one domain to serve the overall situation. General Secretary Xi Jinping visited the southeastern coast and emphasized many times that &quot;economically large provinces must be brave enough to take the lead.&quot; This is the mission of a large economic province to serve the overall situation. During his trip to Heilongjiang this time, the General Secretary urged &quot;strengthening the strategic supporting role of Northeast China.&quot; This is the responsibility and mission of Northeast China in the modernization process. &lt;/P>;&lt;P>;Find the correct positioning and anchor the positioning, so that you will not belittle yourself and have confidence; you will not be arrogant and you will be more clear-headed. General Secretary Xi Jinping has thought deeply about the role of Northeast China in food security: &quot;Ensure that production and supply are sufficient in normal times, and that it can withstand and be reliable in extreme circumstances. This is an overall thinking. Continue to be China&#39;s northern warehouse, and grow The triangle area is the center of China&#39;s cutting-edge science and technology, which is equally glorious and equally important.&quot;&lt;/P>;&lt;P>;A normal mind also means patience and determination. &lt;/P>;&lt;P>;This year I went to Pingjiang Road in Suzhou and watched the flying needles of Suzhou embroidery. General Secretary Xi Jinping sighed with emotion: &quot;The resilience, patience and determination of the Chinese people are part of the Chinese national spirit.&quot;&lt;/P>;&lt; P>;This resilience, patience and determination are also the key to the Chinese nation&#39;s continued survival for thousands of years in the face of complex difficulties and challenges. &lt;/P>;&lt;P>;Our understanding of time is “not in terms of ten years or hundreds of years, but in terms of hundreds or thousands of years.” This is the strategic depth of China&#39;s development, and it is also the basis for our &quot;keeping a normal mind&quot;. &lt;/P>;&lt;P>;In today&#39;s China, the Central Committee of the Party is at the forefront, and the whole country is united. However, it is inevitable that the pace will be a bit hasty in some places. General Secretary Xi Jinping has earnestly urged this. &lt;/P>;&lt;P>;When talking about &quot;accelerating the construction of a modern industrial system with Northeastern characteristics and advantages&quot; at this symposium, the general secretary said: &quot;This speed is also a theory of relativity, and modernization cannot violate the law.&quot;&lt;/P>; &lt;P>;Only when you have a normal mind can you have concentration. Only when you have concentration and wisdom can you better create methods and plan ideas. &lt;/P>;&lt;P>;The high winds, strong waves, and dangerous reefs on the Fuxing Road have not been interrupted in recent years. Faced with &quot;decoupling and breaking links&quot;, China has responded effectively. General Secretary Xi Jinping proposed a new development pattern of &quot;dual circulation&quot;, which was the result of thinking and planning during grassroots research in the spring of 2020. &lt;/P>;&lt;P>;“After the epidemic prevention and control has stabilized, economic recovery will be a process of wave-like development and tortuous progress.” At the Political Bureau meeting of the CPC Central Committee in July this year, General Secretary Xi Jinping said these words, What is demonstrated is the strategic determination of &quot;still calmly flying through the chaotic clouds&quot;. &lt;/P>;&lt;P>;A normal mind is a kind of strategic clarity and strategic determination that is not confused by temporary adversity and understands the essence of things. The development of history has its inevitability and its regularity. There are twists and turns in the progress, and we move forward in twists and turns, &quot;sometimes through dust, sometimes through mud, sometimes across swamps, sometimes through jungles.&quot; &lt;/P>;&lt;P>;I usually have the enterprising spirit of &quot;always worrying&quot;. &lt;/P>;&lt;P>;At this symposium, when talking about achievements, the first thing to affirm is food; when making demands, the first thing to say is that &quot;it is the primary responsibility of Northeast China to be the &#39;ballast stone&#39; for the country&#39;s stable food production and supply.&quot; &lt;/P>;&lt;P>;This is General Secretary Xi Jinping’s tenth visit to Northeast China after the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China. Every time he comes, he talks about food security. Take the protection of black soil as an example:&lt;/P>;&lt;P>;In 2018 in Heilongjiang, the General Secretary proposed to “ensure that black soil is not reduced or degraded.” During the Jilin inspection in 2020, the black soil was described as the &quot;giant panda in the cultivated land&quot; and required to be protected and utilized well. At the end of this year, the Central Rural Work Conference emphasized that &quot;the protection of black soil should be regarded as a major matter.&quot; Later, on August 1, 2022, my country’s Black Land Protection Law was officially implemented. &lt;/P>;&lt;P>;I feel uneasy all the time. &lt;/P>;&lt;P>;General Secretary Xi Jinping has repeatedly mentioned the &quot;nail-driving spirit&quot; and quoted the ancient adage &quot;one small step can lead to a thousand miles&quot;. Times always move forward by constantly solving problems. Chinese-style modernization is walking on a road that has never been walked by predecessors. &quot;Stick to the goal and never relax, dare to venture, dare to work hard, and work hard.&quot;&lt;/P>;&lt;P>;From prosperity to decline, and then to the Rejuvenation is now on a new journey of building a strong country and rejuvenating the nation. To accomplish extraordinary things, you must have extraordinary spirit and extraordinary actions. &lt;/P>;&lt;P>;“I believe in action.”&lt;/P>;&lt;P>;In 2011, when he visited a university in Guizhou, Comrade Xi Jinping talked about “cultivate oneself, manage one’s family, govern the country, and bring peace to the world” in “The University”. Some insights: &lt;/P>;&lt;P>;&quot;Life will face different situations, clouds will roll and the clouds will relax, flowers will bloom and fall. The most important thing is to face them with a normal mind, think independently, and practice internally and externally.&quot;&lt;/P >;&lt;P>;We usually have confidence and responsibility in our hearts. This is true for a person and also for a country. &lt;/P>;&lt;!--/enpcontent-->;</description><pubDate> Wed, 13 Sep 2023 06:26:05 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[01版要闻 - 为强国建设、民族复兴积极贡献力量]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://paper.people.com.cn/rmrb/html/2023-09/13/nw.D110000renmrb_20230913_4-01.htm]]><description> &lt;div>;Wednesday, September 13, 2023&lt;/div>; &lt;!--enpcontent-->;&lt;p>;This year marks the 20th anniversary of the implementation of the customs ranking system.

&lt;!--enpcontent-->;&lt;p>;早上不到7时，柬埔寨西哈努克省西哈努克市笼罩在一片细雨中。市中心尚行人稀少，十几公里外的西哈努克港经济特区（以下简称“西港特区”）大门外却已是车水马龙。正值上班早高峰，通往西港特区的道路上摩托车、汽车络绎不绝，各色雨衣形成了一道流动的风景。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;西港特区是中国批准的首批境外经贸合作区之一，是中柬两国政府间的国家级经济合作区。共建“一带一路”倡议提出10年来，西港特区快速发展，如今已有175家企业入驻，提供近3万个工作岗位。蓬勃发展的西港特区是中柬务实合作的样板，体现出共建“一带一路”的生机和活力。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;“共建&#39;一带一路&#39;倡议提出后，西港特区的发展更快了”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;西港特区道路宽阔整洁，厂房、办公楼、职工宿舍鳞次栉比，邻里中心、一站式服务中心、法律服务中心、卫生服务中心等配套设施一应俱全。很难想象，这里在2008年2月奠基前还一片荒芜，2008年10月才建成第一幢厂房。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“共建&#39;一带一路&#39;倡议提出后，西港特区的发展更快了，现在入驻的企业数量比2013年增加了2倍以上。”西港特区公司董事长陈坚刚对记者说，“以前西港特区以轻工业企业为主，用电少，现在重工业企业增多了，为了保障用电，我们专门建设了自己的热电厂。”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;紧邻西港特区热电厂的，是通用轮胎科技（柬埔寨）有限公司的现代化生产车间。车间内硫化机、成型机轰鸣，工作人员将原材料放入成型机，不到40秒，一条20寸的轮胎就成型了。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;通用轮胎2022年入驻西港特区，厂区规划总用地面积近18万平方米。公司总经理陶国忠对记者说，工厂建成达产后，可年产500万条半钢胎和90万条全钢胎，预计可为当地创造1600个就业岗位。柬埔寨前劳动和职业培训部大臣毅森兴表示，通用轮胎项目投产后带动当地橡胶种植业发展，促进产业集群的形成，进一步推动当地就业和经济发展。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;西哈努克省濒临泰国湾，拥有柬埔寨最大的深水海港。主要生产节日装饰物和礼品的美国嘉富高（柬埔寨）有限公司2013年入驻西港特区。公司首席执行官拉玛尔告诉记者，西港特区靠近港口，物流运输十分便利，设施不断完善，给企业发展提供了良好环境。得益于西港特区的平台优势，该公司产量以每年10%的速度增长。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;2022年，西港特区企业进出口总额达24.93亿美元，约占柬埔寨全国贸易总额的4.8%。西港特区对西哈努克省的经济贡献率超过50%。“西哈努克省的发展离不开西港特区。”西哈努克省省长郭宗仁表示，蓬勃发展的西港特区已成为本地经济的支柱。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;靠近西港特区综合服务中心大楼的一座建筑内，共建“一带一路”倡议十周年西港特区成果展正在面向公众开放。展览以图片、视频、实物相结合的形式，全面呈现西港特区在中柬两国领导人及各级政府的合力支持下取得的累累硕果。今年5月，时任柬埔寨首相洪森在出席展览开幕式时表示：“西港特区的发展成果是柬中共建&#39;一带一路&#39;合作成果的重要组成部分。”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;“人才支持与特区发展相结合的模式值得学习”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;在西港特区的一角，坐落着西哈努克港工商学院。该学院由无锡商业职业技术学院和西港特区公司联合申办，2019年11月开始招生。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;二年级学生安娜来自柬埔寨茶胶省农村，高中毕业后她选择来西哈努克港工商学院深造。主修工商管理专业的同时，她选修了中文、英语、计算机等课程。因为中文进步很快，她已在西港特区找到一份中文翻译工作，如今月工资600多美元。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“学校学费全免，为像我这样的贫困学生提供了很好的学习和工作机会。”安娜说，“我希望通过努力，毕业之后找到一份更好的工作，帮助家里改善生活。”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“我们的学生掌握一定中文和技术后，月工资水平可以达到近400美元。毕业后，他们的月工资能达到600—800美元。”西哈努克港工商学院执行校长李传彬告诉记者，“西港特区的发展需要高素质人才，我们培养出来的学生很多都成了企业的管理骨干。”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;西港特区公司还与无锡商业职业技术学院共同资助培养柬埔寨留学生。阳光是土生土长的西哈努克省人，从无锡商业职业技术学院留学归国后，来到柬埔寨金港高速公路项目工作，目前管理着两个服务区。“以前家里一台摩托车都没有，我要走半小时路去上学。现在工资高了，我就买了一辆汽车。”阳光对未来的生活充满憧憬，“再攒一两年钱，就能盖新房子了！”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;同样位于西港特区的西哈努克省中柬友谊理工学院由中国政府援建，课程以技能培训为主，设有会计金融、信息技术、电力工程等多个专业，目前有1125名在读学生。学院技术培训办公室主任劳亨对记者说，之所以选择在西港特区办校，主要是为了给这里的企业输送人才，学校会根据企业需求提供短期或长期培训。“目前学校80%—90%的学生在特区企业工作，有些学生选择来学院上学，就是为了来西港特区工作。”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;柬埔寨国务大臣毕索坡恩说，在柬埔寨诸多工业园区中，只有西港特区设有培训中心，“人才支持与特区发展相结合的模式值得学习”。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;“现在村子里人气越来越旺，大家的收入也多了起来”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;波雷诺县默德朗乡布腾村毗邻西港特区。一走进村子，记者就看到了尼娅的小卖铺，门面宽敞，货架上整齐摆放着饮料、零食、调味品等。尼娅的老家在贡布省，她和丈夫来西哈努克省已有10多年。“以前，这里什么都缺，尤其是水和电。”她说，“西港特区建起来后，大家的生活条件越来越好。”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;刚来布腾村时，尼娅在一家鞋帽厂工作，丈夫卖咖啡。随着西港特区的发展，周边区域人口越来越多，夫妻俩从中看到了更多商机。尼娅的店面逐渐扩大，她的丈夫也在西港特区干起了建筑工程承包。“现在村子里人气越来越旺，大家的收入也多了起来。”尼娅说。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;沿着平坦的水泥路往前走，随处可见新建的楼房。70多岁的庞沙良正坐在自家院子里和邻居聊天，身后的两层楼房格外惹人注目。庞沙良告诉记者，这栋房子是2022年建成的，每层有10多个房间。因为看好布腾村邻近西港特区的优势，他专门在这里建楼房出租给西港特区工人，院子里的空地租给运输司机作停车位。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;据默德朗乡乡长弥占介绍，该乡近几年人口大幅增长，现在已有2000多户居民，人口超过7000人。“西港特区吸引了大量外来务工人员。村里这些小卖铺、服装店、药店、出租房，很多都是近几年建起来的。”他感叹道，“谁能想到，十几年前，布腾村还到处都是茅草棚子，荒僻得外人很少进来。”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;当地村民以前靠种地、打鱼为生，如今越来越多村民到西港特区工作，有了稳定的收入。培金在西港特区一家企业负责电力维修，入职7年已从一名普通员工成长为成熟的技工。如今，他把摩托车换成了小汽车，家里也建起了新房。他说：“以前，村里的路很窄，都是土路。现在大家日子过得越来越好，一切都不一样了。”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“波雷诺县70%的家庭都有成员在西港特区工作。”弥占说，在西港特区的带动下，默德朗乡已经从贫困乡变成了波雷诺县最富裕的乡镇，几乎家家户户都有两三辆摩托车。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;西港特区建设深度融入西哈努克省乃至柬埔寨经济社会发展，成为中柬共建“一带一路”的生动实践。陈坚刚表示，未来西港特区将持续推进高质量发展，为构建中柬命运共同体作出更大贡献。&lt;/p>;&lt;!--/enpcontent-->;</description><pubDate> Wed, 13 Sep 2023 06:26:05 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[02版要闻 - 俄罗斯总统普京会见张国清]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://paper.people.com.cn/rmrb/html/2023-09/13/nw.D110000renmrb_20230913_3-02.htm]]><description> &lt;div>;2023年09月13日星期三&lt;/div>;
