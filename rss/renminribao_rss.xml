This year, another 4,570.32 acres are planned to be built. At present, 25 new mechanical and electrical wells have been built, and an additional 0.38 kilometers of lining channels have been built.” Zhang Jiahui, Secretary of the Village Party Branch Report a series of numbers. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Stabilize grain production capacity, increase production efficiency, and improve grain growing efficiency. Following Zhang Jiahui, reporters and villagers calculated the &quot;three accounts&quot; of high-standard farmland in the village behind. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Production increase account——&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Improve farmland facilities and increase grain production capacity&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Input: mu this year The average government investment is about 3,200 yuan. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Output: The yield of rice per mu is increased by about 60 kilograms, which saves about 60 yuan per mu; the yield of corn per mu is about 750 kilograms, which saves about 50 yuan per mu. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Walking into the village committee office and opening the file cabinet, Zhang Jiahui found a copy of the meeting minutes, which contained a letter of opinion soliciting village representatives for this year&#39;s Shenyang high-standard farmland construction project. The signatures of the village representatives were lined up in two rows - &quot;Look! It was unanimously approved! At that time, some villagers said that they would be happy to pay some money for the construction, let alone the state giving us money to repair it?&quot; Zhang Jiahui said. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;As early as 2016, Houbianwai Village had carried out high-standard farmland construction, covering 3,800 acres of farmland, built 40 electromechanical wells, 40 water outlets, and excavated dredging channels and paddy field water supply. line. &quot;After the construction was completed, the effect was obvious, and everyone tasted the benefits. So when it was said that high-standard farmland would be built again this year, they all supported it.&quot; Zhang Jiahui said. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Villager Zhang Jiayi is a beneficiary of high-standard farmland construction. After cultivating high-standard farmland all his life, he counted it on his fingers, &quot;There are so many benefits&quot; -&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The most intuitive benefit is that the roads are easier to walk and the water is easier to drain. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“In the past, there were dirt roads in the fields outside the village behind. It was muddy after rain, making it difficult for people to walk, and it was even more difficult for agricultural machinery to enter the fields. Since the flat tractor roads were built, it has become more convenient to work in the fields. It is also easy to get large agricultural machinery in and out.&quot; As he spoke, Zhang Jiayi pointed behind him and said with a smile, the car he bought three years ago can now be driven directly into the fields. &quot;The drainage ditch used to be made of earth. It was exposed to wind, rain, and snow in winter. It broke down and was repaired every year. Grass grew on the ditch, which affected drainage. Since the earth ditch was upgraded to a cement ditch, the water flows faster and the ditch No weeds grow, and drainage is more reliable!&quot;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The most affordable benefit is that the cost of growing grain is reduced. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;With complete facilities, water-saving irrigation of contiguous farmland is more convenient; with supporting roads, mechanized operations are no longer difficult. On the roadside, Zhang Jiayi raised his hand and pointed, &quot;This large area is my family&#39;s land. We have planted more than 400 acres, with rice and corn covering almost half each.&quot; Since the establishment of high-standard farmland, the average water saving per mu of paddy fields has been more than 30 cubic meters. , the amount of chemical fertilizer used per mu was reduced by 20 kilograms. &quot;Counting these two items, rice can save about 60 yuan per mu, and corn can save about 50 yuan per mu.&quot; Zhang Jiayi said, &quot;Before the mechanical and electrical wells were built, diesel engines were used to generate electricity. Now that there are mechanical and electrical wells, the cost has been saved. Most of it.&quot;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The most important benefit is to ensure harvests despite droughts and floods, and to ensure high yields. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;High-standard farmland construction makes up for the shortcomings of insufficient irrigation and drainage facilities and enhances farmland’s disaster prevention, resilience and disaster reduction capabilities. &quot;The west side of the village is black soil, and there were no drainage ditches at first. There was a lot of rainfall one year, and the fields were seriously waterlogged, and a lot of crops were lost.&quot; Zhang Jiayi recalled that the year before last, there were droughts in spring and floods in autumn. Because high-standard farmland was built, his family&#39;s land was destroyed. There was neither drought nor flood, so we were not affected at all and still had a good harvest. Last year, Zhang Jiayi&#39;s family harvested 340,000 jins of corn and 300,000 jins of rice, and earned more than 150,000 yuan from growing grain. &quot;A few years ago, how could I have imagined that this number would be this?&quot;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;What makes farmers most comfortable is that there is &quot;zero personal investment&quot; in the construction of high-standard farmland, which is completely funded by the government. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The investment in high-standard farmland construction in Houbianwai Village in 2016 was about 4.95 million yuan, with an average investment of about 1,300 yuan per mu. After the construction, the village&#39;s rice yield per mu increased by about 60 kilograms, and the income per mu increased by more than 210 yuan; the corn yield per mu was about 750 kilograms, and the income per mu increased by nearly 200 yuan. This year, the investment in high-standard farmland construction projects in Houbianwai Village is about 14.97 million yuan, with an average investment of about 3,200 yuan per mu. In the future, the income from growing grains is expected to further increase. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Why are villagers like Zhang Jiayi who participated in the high-standard farmland construction project in the last round willing to participate this time? It turns out that this year not only the project area was expanded, but also the quality was upgraded, with higher standards and better facilities: the gravel road was transformed into a cement road, the mechanical and electrical wells were upgraded from 50 meters and 60 meters to 70 meters, and the channels were relined. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;In Liaozhong District, there are a total of 39 high-standard farmland construction projects like Houbiianwai Village, with a planned construction area of ​​856,750 acres, achieving full coverage of basic farmland. Last year, Liaozhong District’s grain output reached 1.103 billion kilograms, remaining above 1 billion kilograms for 11 consecutive years, an increase of 234 kilograms per mu compared with 2018, boosting farmers’ income by 80 million yuan. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;As of the end of last year, the total area of ​​high-standard farmland in Liaoning reached 34.11 million acres, accounting for 54.56% of the province’s permanent basic farmland area. Thanks to high-standard farmland construction, farmland infrastructure in various regions has been continuously improved, the quality of farmland has been steadily improved, and comprehensive agricultural production capabilities have been further improved, providing solid support for stable and increased grain production. Last year, Liaoning&#39;s grain yield averaged 930 kilograms per mu, and its total grain output reached 24.845 million tons. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;In July this year, Liaoning issued the &quot;Notice on Actively Using Policy-based Development Financial Funds to Accelerate the Construction of High-Standard Farmland and Improvement of Cultivated Land Quality&quot;, which clearly stated that the primary goal is to increase grain production capacity and deepen the political and banking cooperation. Cooperation mechanism, actively explore innovations in investment and financing models, form a diversified investment pattern, gradually build all permanent basic farmland into high-standard farmland, and improve investment standards and construction efficiency. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Efficiency Account——&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Improve the quality of farmland construction and increase the efficiency of grain production&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Previously : Each person can plant up to 2 acres of seedlings per day, and each person can harvest 1 acres of corn per day. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Now: a rice transplanter can plant 60 acres of seedlings a day, and a harvester can harvest hundreds of acres of corn a day; the land transfer price has increased by more than 300 yuan per mu, and the intensive utilization rate of land has increased significantly. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;There was a stone pole standing by the field, with a switch box hanging on the pole. Zhang Jiayi opened the lid of the box and turned the switch. Accompanied by the sound of &quot;gurgling&quot;, gurgling well water is pumped out from the ground dozens of meters deep, pours into a deep and 30 cm wide cement channel, and then flows hundreds of meters along the way, nourishing fields. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;With connected canals and connected roads, fields that were once inconvenient to irrigate have now become high-yield fields. High-efficiency water-saving irrigation and large-scale agricultural machinery operations are more convenient, and agricultural production efficiency has been greatly improved. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&quot;As the old saying goes, &#39;Don&#39;t plant rice in June&#39;, but in our village, rice planting always had to be postponed until after June. Why? It&#39;s so busy! People with quick hands can only plant 2 acres in a day fields. Now, one rice transplanter can plant 60 acres in one day; when harvesting corn, each person used to harvest one mu of land per day, but now one harvester can harvest hundreds of acres in one day.&quot; Zhang Jiayi said that agricultural machinery operations It ensures the farming time and saves manpower. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;In Zhang Jiahui’s view, high-standard farmland not only improves production efficiency, but also improves intensive land utilization. &quot;Since the establishment of high-standard farmland, the land transfer rate and transfer price in our village have been rising. By last year, the transfer price had increased by more than 300 yuan per mu on average, and the village collective income had increased by 65,000 yuan. The villagers&#39; transfer income has steadily increased.&quot;&lt;/ p>;&lt;p>;The land has been transferred and time is abundant. Many farmers have also freed up their time to go out to work and make money. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“In the past two years, the income from circulation has increased, so I transferred the land and went to work in a sock factory or cooperative.” Han Guizhen, a 60-year-old villager, said, “This year, my family’s income from circulation per mu of land has increased More than 900 yuan, and you can earn two to three thousand yuan a month by working part-time.&quot;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;It is not just the farmers who have settled the &quot;big accounts&quot;, but also the builders and operators of high-standard farmland. A company in Liaozhong District is responsible for a high-standard farmland project under construction in Houbianwai Village. Han Lin, the person in charge of the company, said: &quot;Our construction period is staggered with the busy farming time. During the slack farming period, the construction period is rushed; during the busy farming period, we would rather slow down the construction progress.&quot;&lt; /p>;&lt;p>;Next to a rice field at the west end of the village, several excavators were waving their &quot;arms&quot; to lay roads in the fields. From time to time, villagers stopped to watch. Han Lin said that they are responsible for more than 20 high-standard farmland construction projects, involving 11 streets in Liaozhong District. From design to construction, they communicate with towns and villages at any time, and then contact village cadres and villagers to ensure that the construction details meet the needs of farmers. &quot;One weekend, a village party secretary called me and said that the villagers were dissatisfied with the slope of the pipeline. We quickly coordinated and made timely adjustments and optimizations.&quot;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Liaoning has introduced a full-cycle design, review, and evaluation plan for high-standard farmland projects. In various systems such as supervision, construction, acceptance, management and maintenance, and financial capital investment, the &quot;three-inspection system&quot; of self-inspection by the construction unit, parallel inspection by the supervision unit, and quality sampling inspection of the project legal person throughout the entire process will be implemented, and the construction standards will be further clarified. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;If it is well built, it must be well managed and maintained. Shenyang innovatively promotes high-standard farmland &quot;damage project insurance&quot;. The construction unit purchases the insurance, and the insurance company performs the repair work of the damaged project within 10 years after the completion and acceptance of the project, and dispatches project supervision during the construction stage. At the same time, the local government has also built an online supervision platform to conduct closed-loop management of key links such as project progress, fund management, and post-construction management and maintenance. It has also formed innovative measures such as &quot;institutional guarantee&quot;, &quot;insurance escort&quot; and &quot;IoT monitoring&quot; to effectively ensure the safety of farmland. Engineering facilities continue to perform efficiently. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Increase revenue collection——&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Hide grain in the ground, store grain in skills, and increase enthusiasm for growing grain&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt; p>;In the past: Fertilizer was carried on the back and scooped with hands, which was hard work and difficult to control the amount. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Today: The mechanization rate has increased, agricultural technology has been widely used, and the per capita income from agricultural production in Houbianwai Village has increased by 600 yuan. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&quot;Self-test successful, take off in 3 seconds! 3, 2, 1...&quot;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;A drone accelerates and rotates its rotor, propels forward over the corn field, and spreads evenly Fertilizer is applied, and the green &quot;ocean&quot; is blown into waves. This is what fertilizing looks like this summer. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“In the past, when fertilizing and spraying pesticides, drones could not land or fly in some areas and had to rely on manpower. Now, the roads are smooth and drones can fly to every corner of the field.” The speaker was 54-year-old Yue Zhihong, a major grain grower in the village behind. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;In the early years, drones were not a &quot;good helper&quot; for fertilization. At that time, farmers had to carry heavy fertilizer bags, walk to the middle of the fields, bend down to scoop up the fertilizer, wave it out with their hands, and then walk towards The next piece...it&#39;s hard work, and I can&#39;t control the amount of fertilizer. Nowadays, drones fly in a circle, efficiently and accurately. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;When you walk into Yue Zhihong’s yard, you will see a dazzling array of large agricultural machinery and equipment such as tractors, planters, harvesters, and forklifts. &quot;The agricultural infrastructure is good and suitable for mechanized operations and large-scale production. I have learned several agricultural machinery operations in the past few years. My family planted 600 acres of land this year, most of which are paddy fields, and all are mechanized operations.&quot; Yue Zhihong said. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“With high-standard farmland, large grain growers have an even more urgent need for agricultural technology. For every training, everyone is very motivated to sign up.” Agricultural Technology Promotion Station of Liaozhong District Rural Revitalization and Development Center Researcher Yu Kuiwu said that high-standard farmland construction has improved soil fertility and fertility, and new technologies such as soil testing, formula fertilization, and green plant protection have become more widely used. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Zhao Yuxin, director of the Liaozhong District Rural Revitalization and Development Center, introduced that in recent years, as the pace of high-standard farmland construction has accelerated, technologies such as organic fertilizer spreading, water-saving irrigation, and comprehensive rice pest and disease control have been introduced into the fields, and the effects have been More and more farmers recognize it. Last year, the comprehensive mechanization rate of corn and rice in Liaozhong District reached 95.8%, and the rate of drone control of crop diseases and pests reached 85%. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;天色暗下来，岳志红戴上头灯，套好手套，骑着三轮车来到稻田边。停好车，拎着桶，深一脚浅一脚蹚进田里。他弯下腰一探手，起身时手上已抓着一只螃蟹。 “秋风起，蟹脚痒。抓蟹得晚上，养蟹得注意喂食，喂豆粕，能壮黄……”不一会儿，岳志红就抓了满满一桶螃蟹。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“我寻思，咱这农田设施都完善，地力也好，就专门跑到盘锦学了技术，村里非常支持。前年我开始尝试稻田养蟹，一水两用，一地双收！这不就多挣了吗？”岳志红在自家的500亩稻田养蟹，去年，水稻收入每亩增加300元，稻田蟹每亩收入500元。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;一地双收，农田产出更多效益。在后边外村，越来越多村民开始学技术，发展稻田养蟹、稻田养鸭。在村干部带动下，2021年，后边外村成立喜稻种养殖合作社，吸纳全村九成以上农户加入。去年，稻田养蟹面积达1200亩，产值近380万元，村里还注册了稻田蟹和稻田米商标，拓展电商渠道，进一步增加农产品附加值。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;很难想象，几年前，后边外村还是个无项目、缺产业的薄弱村。张家辉回忆道，“耕地少，人均2亩地，还都很碎，每户耕地不连片，有的被分成好几块小田，种起来费劲。那时种粮得靠天吃饭，产量没保障，效益一直上不去。”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;如今，乡亲们种粮有了赚头和盼头。 “正因为建设高标准农田，我们才能抓住机会，推动土地流转，发展壮大村集体经济。”张家辉介绍，去年，后边外村人均收入2.5万元，在农业生产方面，人均增收600元，“现在，村里农田是高标准，大伙过的是好日子！”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;本期统筹：蒋雪婕&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;数据来源：农业农村部&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;版式设计：沈亦伶&lt;/p>;&lt;!--/enpcontent-->;</description><pubDate> Tue, 03 Oct 2023 05:26:06 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[02版要闻 - 为经济发展注入动能活力（高质量发展调研行）]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://paper.people.com.cn/rmrb/html/2023-10/03/nw.D110000renmrb_20231003_2-02.htm]]><description> &lt;div>;2023年10月03日星期二&lt;/div>;

&lt;!--enpcontent-->;&lt;P>;1936年初夏，美国记者埃德加·斯诺冲破重重封锁，进入陕北苏区采访，记录下红军的故事、苏区的故事、长征的故事、延安的故事。访问归来，妻子海伦·福斯特·斯诺帮助他整理书稿和照片资料，为次年《红星照耀中国》（中译本名为《西行漫记》）的问世做了大量工作。1937年4月，斯诺女士冒险访问陕北，在延安采访，写下《续西行漫记》等作品。《西行漫记》和《续西行漫记》被认为是报道和介绍中国共产党和“红色中国”的优秀纪实性作品。如今，斯诺女士的侄孙亚当·福斯特也在致力于促进美中人文交流与合作。&lt;/P>;&lt;P>;亚当·福斯特是美国海伦·福斯特·斯诺基金会主席。2022年年初，亚当·福斯特致信习近平主席，回顾斯诺女士为美中民间友好所作出的贡献，表示将继承斯诺女士促进美中民间友好合作精神，为美中人民交流互动搭建桥梁。“我们致信习近平主席，也是为了感谢中国人民对斯诺女士的纪念以及对基金会事业的支持。美中两国人民本着友谊的精神进行交往，符合两国的最大利益。”亚当·福斯特说。&lt;/P>;&lt;P>;2022年1月27日，习近平主席复信亚当·福斯特时指出，斯诺夫妇积极推动了中国工合运动，为创建山丹培黎学校发挥了重要作用。中国人民铭记包括斯诺夫妇在内的国际友人为中国革命和建设事业作出的贡献，以及对中国共产党和中国人民的真挚情谊。习近平主席对海伦·福斯特·斯诺家族多年来为发展中美关系作出的积极贡献予以高度评价，希望亚当·福斯特和基金会继续以斯诺夫妇为榜样，为增进中美两国人民的友谊合作作出新的贡献。&lt;/P>;&lt;P>;“这是我们永远不会忘记的一天。”亚当·福斯特说，收到习近平主席的回信，整个家族的成员都非常感动。“习近平主席给我们复信，体现出中国国家领导人重视两国人民开展友好合作、搭建交往桥梁。”&lt;/P>;&lt;P>;亚当·福斯特年轻时曾阅读斯诺女士的回忆录《我在中国的岁月》。书中讲述了中国的“一二·九”运动、西安事变等事件。亚当·福斯特被深深吸引。2016年，亚当·福斯特受邀前往陕西省，参观了斯诺夫妇曾经生活过的地方。所到之处，很多人都能说清斯诺夫妇与中国乃至亚洲的渊源，这让亚当·福斯特深受触动。&lt;/P>;&lt;P>;那次中国之行后，亚当·福斯特开始着手研究斯诺女士的生平事迹，并通过斯诺夫妇的著作加深了对中国和中国人民的了解。2018年，海伦·福斯特·斯诺基金会成立，并与陕西省斯诺研究中心合作，在美中之间推动开展了斯诺女士纪念日系列活动、线上课程、大型图片展等文化交流活动。亚当·福斯特说：“让世界了解中国，是斯诺女士的事业，也是我们应该继承的事业。”&lt;/P>;&lt;P>;目前，海伦·福斯特·斯诺基金会正努力从教育、文化、商业、地方关系上着手搭建平台，促进美中双方对话、接触及务实合作。“尽管美中双方在一些领域存在分歧，但两国的交往历史和人民之间的友谊提醒我们，双方存在许多共通之处。我们应致力于团结，而非分裂。”亚当·福斯特说，从商界人士到学者、学生等，美国大多数民众希望美中密切联系、加强合作。作为具有全球影响力的两个大国，美中应该加强友好交往，增进人文交流，搭建起通向和平与繁荣未来的桥梁。&lt;/P>;&lt;P>;埃德加·斯诺曾如此描述对中国共产党的观察：“那种精神，那种力量，那种欲望，那种热情……是人类历史本身的丰富而灿烂的精华。”亚当·福斯特表示：“正是在这种精神、力量与热情的鼓舞与带动下，中国人民让今天的中国，与斯诺夫妇所处的年代相比发生了翻天覆地的变化。”中国现行标准下农村贫困人口全部脱贫，困扰中华民族千百年的绝对贫困问题历史性地得到解决。2022年，人均国内生产总值超过1.2万美元。“中国全面消除绝对贫困，这是一个非常伟大的成就。中国变得更加现代化，人民生活水平大幅改善，这是全世界都在关注的话题。”&lt;/P>;&lt;P>;“中国人民的物质生活发生了巨大变化，但是对待外国朋友的友好和热情丝毫未减。无论我们走到哪里，都能感受到中国人民的尊重和善意。”亚当·福斯特说，“我要向中国人民表达我们的敬意。太平洋两岸的美中人民加深相互理解极其重要，希望美国和中国的年轻一代携手合作、增进友谊。”&lt;/P>;&lt;!--/enpcontent-->;</description><pubDate> Tue, 03 Oct 2023 05:26:06 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
