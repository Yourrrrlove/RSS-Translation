To summarize the 10 years of practical experience in the new era, analyze the new situations and new problems we are currently facing, and continue to promote the construction of ecological civilization, we must be guided by the thought of socialist ecological civilization with Chinese characteristics for a new era and correctly handle several major relationships. &lt;/P>;&lt;P>;The article points out that the first is to correctly handle the relationship between high-quality development and high-level protection. High-quality development and high-level protection complement and complement each other. High-level protection is an important support for high-quality development. High-quality development that prioritizes ecology, green and low carbon can only be achieved by relying on high-level protection. Throughout the entire process of Chinese-style modernization, we must grasp the dialectical and unified relationship between high-quality development and high-level protection. We must plan development from the perspective of harmonious coexistence between man and nature, take the carrying capacity of resources and the environment as the premise and foundation, and consciously limit economic activities and human behavior to the limits that natural resources and the ecological environment can bear. Through high-level protection, we will continue to create new momentum and new advantages for development, strive to build a green and low-carbon circular economic system, effectively reduce the resource and environmental costs of development, and continue to enhance the potential and stamina of development. &lt;/P>;&lt;P>;The article pointed out that the second is to correctly handle the relationship between key tasks and collaborative governance. Ecological environment management is a systematic project that requires overall consideration of the complexity of environmental factors, the integrity of the ecosystem, the continuity of natural geographical units, and the sustainability of economic and social development. It is necessary to adhere to the system concept, seize the main contradictions and main aspects of contradictions, take effective measures to highlight ecological and environmental issues, and at the same time strengthen target coordination, multi-pollutant control coordination, departmental coordination, regional coordination, and policy coordination, and continuously enhance the effectiveness of various tasks. Systematic, holistic and collaborative. At present, we must maintain strategic focus and continue to fight the tough battle against pollution. &lt;/P>;&lt;P>;The article points out that the third is to correctly handle the relationship between natural restoration and artificial restoration. First of all, we must fully respect and comply with nature, give nature enough time and space to recuperate, and rely on the power of nature to restore the balance of the ecosystem. At the same time, the limitations and limits of natural restoration have put forward higher requirements for artificial restoration, leaving a vast space for positive actions. It is necessary to organically unify natural recovery and artificial restoration, implement policies according to local conditions, time conditions, and classification, and strive to find the best solution for ecological protection and restoration. Adhere to the integrated protection and systematic management of mountains, rivers, forests, fields, lakes, grass and sand, build a large-scale protection and management pattern from the top of the mountain to the ocean, comprehensively use natural restoration and artificial restoration methods, and continuously promote ecological construction. &lt;/P>;&lt;P>;The article points out that the fourth is to correctly handle the relationship between external constraints and endogenous motivation. A good ecological environment is the fairest public product and the most universal welfare for people. Only when everyone takes action and fulfills their responsibilities, and stimulates the endogenous motivation of the whole society to jointly protect the ecological environment, can the blue sky, green mountains and green waters of China last forever. We must always adhere to the strictest system and strictest rule of law to protect the ecological environment and maintain normalized external pressure. &lt;/P>;&lt;P>;The article points out that the fifth is to correctly handle the relationship between &quot;double carbon&quot; commitments and independent actions. Promoting carbon peak and carbon neutrality is a major strategic decision made by the Party Central Committee after careful consideration. It is our solemn commitment to the international community. It is also an intrinsic requirement to promote the transformation and upgrading of the economic structure, form a competitive advantage in green and low-carbon industries, and achieve high-quality development. The &quot;double carbon&quot; goal we are committed to is unwavering, but the path and method, rhythm and intensity of achieving this goal should and must be decided by ourselves and will never be influenced by others. It is necessary to accelerate the planning and construction of new energy systems to ensure energy security. Optimize and adjust the industrial structure so that development is based on efficient use of resources, strict protection of the ecological environment, and effective control of greenhouse gas emissions. For traditional industries, it is necessary to promote the upgrading of processes, technologies, and equipment to achieve green and low-carbon transformation. It is necessary to participate in global climate governance with a more active attitude and form a new situation that is more proactive and beneficial. &lt;/P>;&lt;!--/enpcontent-->;</description><pubDate> Thu, 16 Nov 2023 06:26:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[01版要闻 - 让产业合作的桥越筑越牢、和平发展的路越走越广]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://paper.people.com.cn/rmrb/html/2023-11/16/nw.D110000renmrb_20231116_3-01.htm]]><description> &lt;div>;Thursday, November 16, 2023&lt;/div>; &lt;!--enpcontent-->;&lt;p>;“Achieving the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation has opened up broad space for cross-Strait economic cooperation, and realizing the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation requires the joint efforts of compatriots on both sides of the strait. ”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;On the 14th, General Secretary of the CPC Central Committee and President Xi Jinping sent a congratulatory letter to the 10th anniversary annual meeting of the 2023 Cross-Strait Entrepreneurs Summit, clarifying the consensus and truth that the cross-Strait economy belongs to the Chinese national economy and that compatriots on both sides are a community of destiny , declared the principled position of being committed to promoting cross-Strait economic exchanges and cooperation, deepening the integrated development of various fields across the Strait, helping Taiwan compatriots and Taiwanese enterprises integrate into the new development pattern, and achieve high-quality development, fully reflecting the support for the cross-Strait business circles, business circles and the majority of Taiwan compatriots.

This is a set of data often mentioned by Zhang Yuwei, general manager of Nanjing Nante Precision Machinery Co., Ltd. “Before coming to the mainland, we couldn’t have imagined this kind of development speed,” he said. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Recently, the high-end manufacturing equipment industry has become a “new track” that Zhang Yuwei is optimistic about. He decided to spend money to renovate the workshop and prepare for industrial upgrading and adjustment.

The 2023 annual meeting of the China Council for International Cooperation on Environment and Development was held in Beijing in August. Speaking of China’s energy transition and renewable energy development, Vice Chairman of the CCICED, Deputy Secretary-General of the United Nations, and &quot;This is really amazing,&quot; said Anderson, executive director of UNEP. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The CCICED was established in 1992 and is an international high-level policy advisory body. It is precisely because of years of continuous research that senior figures, experts and scholars in the field of environment and development at home and abroad have gained insight into the unremitting efforts and amazing results of the world&#39;s largest developing country in promoting green and low-carbon development. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Let’s take a look at two impressive columnar trend charts first. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;A picture shows coal. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;In 2012, 68.5%; in 2017, 60.6%; in 2022, 56.2% - the proportion of coal in primary energy consumption has steadily declined year by year. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Promoting the green and low-carbon transformation of the energy structure, &quot;coal-rich&quot; China ranks first in the world in installed hydropower, wind power, and photovoltaic power generation. In the first half of this year, the installed capacity of renewable energy historically surpassed coal power. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Another picture shows a new energy vehicle. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;In 2014, there were 220,000 vehicles; in 2017, 1.534 million vehicles; in 2022, 13.1 million vehicles; as of the end of September this year, there were more than 18.2 million vehicles - the number of new energy vehicles in the country has increased significantly year by year. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The construction of a green and low-carbon transportation system is accelerating. More than half of the world&#39;s new energy vehicles are driving in China, and production and sales have ranked first in the world for eight consecutive years. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The period between “down” and “up” represents a solid step towards green development that prioritizes ecology, and a tenacious struggle to climb over obstacles and overcome difficulties. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;What continues to decline is energy consumption per unit of GDP, carbon dioxide emissions, water consumption... and what continues to rise is forest coverage, grassland vegetation coverage, per capita park green space...a series of data It shows that the resource and environmental costs of my country&#39;s economic growth continue to decrease, and the &quot;green content&quot; and &quot;gold content&quot; of economic and social development continue to increase. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Thousands of miles of rivers and mountains become more colorful. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The water is clearer, the sky is bluer, and the ground is greener. Environmental monitoring data confirms the tangible and tangible experiences in our daily lives. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;For example, the proportion of national surface water sections with excellent quality will rise to 87.9% in 2022, which is close to the level of developed countries. In the first three quarters of this year, it increased by 0.8 percentage points compared with the same period last year. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;For another example, in 2022, the proportion of days with good air quality in 339 cities at the prefecture level and above reached 86.5%. China has become the country with the fastest improvement in air quality in the world. The rate of good air quality has remained at a high level since this year. , showing a clear improvement trend overall. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Green and low-carbon development has gained momentum. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;In the first 10 months of this year, my country&#39;s new energy vehicle production and sales increased by 33.9% and 37.8% respectively year-on-year. In the first three quarters of this year, the total exports of the &quot;three new items&quot; of foreign trade: electric passenger vehicles, lithium-ion batteries, and solar cells increased by 41.7% year-on-year, accounting for a year-on-year increase of 1.3 percentage points in my country&#39;s exports. Solar cell production increased by 63.2%. Green transformation has an important impact on industry. The drive for production is enhanced. The Hangzhou Asian Games, which takes &quot;green&quot; as an important hosting concept, allows the world to see China&#39;s new high-quality development. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Green, low-carbon, cyclic development is the direction of technological revolution and industrial transformation in today&#39;s era. Our country has opened up new tracks, created new markets, and formed many new economic growth points in this regard. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“Lucid waters and lush mountains are invaluable assets, and improving the ecological environment is developing productivity.” Correctly handling the relationship between high-quality development and high-level protection, we are constantly shaping new momentum and new advantages for development, and continuing to enhance Development potential and stamina. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Needless to say, ecological and environmental protection still faces severe challenges. In the first three quarters of this year, the average proportion of days with good air quality in cities at prefecture level and above nationwide dropped by 1.5 percentage points year-on-year, and the average concentration of PM2.5 increased by 3.7% year-on-year. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;What do you think? On the one hand, drought, lack of rain and strong winds in the northern region lead to frequent sand and dust weather, which is an important factor; on the other hand, this also shows that the structural, root and trend pressures on ecological and environmental protection have not been fundamentally relieved, and the solution is long-term and complex. , arduous, &quot;The construction of ecological civilization is still in a critical period of mounting pressure and heavy burdens.&quot;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Ecological governance has a long road ahead, but it is about to happen. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Standing at the strategic height of the sustainable development of the Chinese nation, the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core has always maintained a clear understanding and strategic determination to strengthen the construction of ecological civilization. Take this year as an example. At the beginning of the year, General Secretary Xi Jinping went to local inspections and surveys, chaired important meetings, and issued important instructions. As always, he attached great importance to and vigorously promoted the construction of ecological civilization as the &quot;biggest country&quot;. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Promoting green and low-carbon economic and social development is a key link in achieving high-quality development. We have traveled through thousands of mountains and rivers, but we still need to cross mountains and rivers. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;When Anderson and other foreign experts and scholars participated in the CCICED, they were &quot;surprised by the speed at which China&#39;s transportation vehicles are electrified&quot; and &quot;feel that the city is more livable and the air is cleaner.&quot; As the construction of Beautiful China is fully advanced and the green background of high-quality development continues to be planted, when they come to China again, they will definitely see a more beautiful picture of the harmonious coexistence of man and nature. &lt;/p>;&lt;!--/enpcontent-->; &lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https:// feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 16 Nov 2023 06:26:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[01版要闻 - 重庆着力服务构建新发展格局（高质量发展调研行）]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://paper.people.com.cn/rmrb/html/2023-11/16/nw.D110000renmrb_20231116_6-01.htm]]><description> &lt;div>;Thursday, November 16, 2023&lt;/div>; &lt;!--enpcontent-->;&lt;p>;In the automobile factory, the robotic arm is running like flying, and each Chongqing &quot;smart-made&quot; new energy vehicle is full of technology.

In the first three quarters of this year, Chongqing achieved a regional GDP of 2.224388 billion yuan, a year-on-year increase of 5.6%. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Concentrate efforts to activate the innovation engine and promote the accelerated rise of industrial energy levels&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;As a traditional manufacturing center, Chongqing has a complete range of manufacturing industries and a good industrial foundation. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;How to enhance your advantages? The answer given by Chongqing is: conquer new technologies, seize new tracks, and cultivate new momentum. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Walking into Chongqing Liyituo Software Co., Ltd., a car collision simulation experiment was displayed on the computer screen: as the parameters increased, the car suspension began to bend and deform, and finally broke. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“Through technical research on computer-aided engineering software, we have cracked the ‘hard nut’ of the industry and achieved full digitization of the testing process.” Company founder Li Bo explained while operating, “With the help of virtual simulation Technology can accurately understand the fatigue durability performance of automobiles and diagnose subtle design defects.&quot;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;As an important automobile industry base in the country, Chongqing is home to 21 vehicle companies and more than a thousand enterprises above designated size. Actively target the new development opportunities of intelligent connected new energy vehicles, comprehensively sort out the pain points and difficulties of upstream and downstream products and enterprises in the industrial chain, and promote the innovative development, transformation and upgrading of the automobile industry towards intelligence, high-end, and green. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“New technologies cultivate new momentum. In the first half of this year, Chongqing’s automobile industry maintained a good development trend, contributing 21.4% to the city’s industrial growth. Among them, the output value of new energy vehicles increased by 33.8% year-on-year, which contributed to the city’s industrial growth. The automobile industry&#39;s growth contribution rate is as high as 85%,&quot; said Tu Xingyong, deputy director of Chongqing Municipal Economic and Information Technology Commission. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Walking into Chongqing Yuhai Precision Manufacturing Co., Ltd. located in Bishan District, Deputy General Manager He Bo said that through the intelligent transformation of the production line, more than 400 robots and automation equipment have been introduced, &quot;the automation rate of injection molding machines has increased from 5 % jumped to more than 50%, and the yield rate increased to more than 99%.&quot;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;In Jiulongpo District, in the casting plant of Chinalco Southwest Aluminum (Group) Co., Ltd., large-sized ingots are cast one after another Freshly &quot;coming out&quot;... From the earliest days of relying entirely on imports to joining forces with universities and colleges to form a research team, after hundreds of experiments, Southwest Aluminum has successively broken through a series of key technical problems such as the preparation of large-size ingots. So far, it has accumulated a total of C919 Domestic large passenger aircraft provide 30 specifications and more than 1,000 pieces of aluminum alloy materials. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The biopharmaceutical industry cluster is one of the emerging characteristic industrial clusters vigorously developed in Chongqing. Banan District is located in an international biocity with a planned area of ​​64 square kilometers. &quot;The park currently has hundreds of projects, with an agreed output value exceeding 100 billion yuan.

In the first October, the growth rate of industrial added value above designated size accelerated from January to September. The service industry production index reached 7.9%, which was the same as from January to September. The continuous improvement of production and sales, the continuous growth of corporate profits, the growth rate of finished product inventory falling to the low level of history, etc., all help to enhance the enthusiasm of enterprise production and add more motivation to the increase in production. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; ——The innovation movement is continuously enhanced. The innovation -driven development strategy is implemented in depth, and the rapid development of new products and new formats. In the first October, the investment in high -tech industries increased by 11.1%year -on -year, faster than the total investment of 8.2 percentage points, and the output of new energy products remained rapidly growing.

The relevant person in charge of the State Medical Insurance Bureau said that the intelligent monitoring system and the normalization of intelligent monitoring, and strengthening real -time dynamic tracking of the use of medical insurance funds is very necessary. Intelligent review and monitoring of the Medical Insurance Fund is an essential tool for daily review and settlement of the medical insurance department, and it is also an important means for supervision of the medical insurance fund in the information age. It is also an important technical support for the people to &quot;see a doctor&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; It is understood that the construction of intelligent supervision subsystems in various places is unbalanced and the application results are large. However, it is necessary to introduce the &quot;Notice&quot; to increase work advancement and promote the application of the local medical insurance department to accelerate the implementation of the national 1.0 &quot;two library&quot; framework system. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; It has good informatization conditions and business foundations to speed up intelligent review and monitoring. On the one hand, the national unified medical insurance information platform is fully completed. Relying on the platform, the intelligent regulatory subsystem is to improve efficiency for regulatory work, and promote the safety, efficient and reasonable use of funds. On the other hand, since 2019, the construction of intelligent audit and monitoring demonstration sites has been carried out in 32 cities; in March 2022, the &quot;Intelligent Review and Monitoring Knowledge Base of Medical Security Fund and the Management Measures for the Regulations (Trial)&quot; was formulated; In the month, the &quot;two library&quot; framework system for unified nationwide and regulations is formed, and the deployment application is completed on the intelligent regulatory subsystem of the medical insurance information platform. These tasks have consolidated the foundation for further accelerating the intelligent review and monitoring of the Medical Insurance Fund. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; The intelligent audit and monitoring system was basically established at the end of 2025 &lt;/strong>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The &quot;Notice&quot; clearly clearly, the intelligent supervision subsystem, intelligent audit and intelligent audit and intelligent audit and intelligent audit of the area by 2023 Monitoring data accurately upload the national medical insurance information platform, comprehensively carry out intelligent review of the office, standardize the service behavior of designated pharmaceutical institutions, strengthen agreement processing and administrative regulatory, organize verification and administrative law enforcement, and initially realize the national intelligent monitoring &quot;one network&quot;. By the end of 2025, the standardized, scientific and normalized intelligent audit and monitoring system will be established. Can be able to review medical insurance audit and fund supervision, and form a normalized regulatory system in various ways such as daily review and on -site inspection, big data analysis, and intelligent monitoring of the whole scene. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The &quot;Notice&quot; requires to strengthen the construction and application of &quot;two libraries&quot;. It is required to accurately grasp the focus of the &quot;two libraries&quot; construction, and give the medical insurance departments at all levels to fully autonomy. Under the framework system of the national &quot;two libraries&quot;, combined with local actual replenishment rules and knowledge, set rules, indicators, thresholds, applications, applications, applications, and applications. Scenes, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; Inspiring fixed -point pharmaceutical institutions docking intelligent regulatory subsystems &lt;/strong>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The &quot;Notice&quot; require Effective measures, encourage fixed -point pharmaceutical institutions to take the initiative to connect the intelligent regulatory subsystem, and the system docking situation is linked to the annual assessment of the designated pharmaceutical institution. Exploring policies for actively strengthening the application of intelligent supervision systems and carrying out self -examination and self -correction, and giving policies such as reducing the frequency of on -site inspection. The relevant person in charge of the State Medical Insurance Bureau said that the supervision of the designated pharmaceutical institutions in the medical insurance department promoted each other with its internal management. Intelligent review and monitoring are only the means of supervision and inspection. It is basically to urge medical institutions to diagnose and treat reasonable diagnosis and treatment, and ensure that the medical insurance fund is spent on the &quot;blade&quot; of seeking medical treatment for the people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; For example, the focus of the reminder in advance is that strict real -name medical treatment, standardized diagnosis and treatment behavior, standardized billing charges, early warning excess drug prescriptions, and early warning expenses. Through identity recognition and video surveillance, strictly implement the real -name medical purchase and purchase medicine system to ensure that the person&#39;s certificate is consistent. Reminding the hospital in advance can help the hospital discover deep problems in internal control management, medical behavior, and charging methods. For the entire medical industry, it is conducive to standardizing practice and creating an industry environment with a righteous industry. At the same time, it prevented the medical insurance funds from illegal expenditure and promoted hospitals to improve comprehensive strength and high -quality development. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;Generally speaking, medical institutions can automatically remind and intercept the obvious violations of medical staff through intelligent monitoring, and remind them in real time on suspicious violations.&quot; The person in charge said that at present, it is increasingly increasingly increasingly increasingly increasingly. The more fixed -point hospitals actively use intelligent monitoring to achieve self -examination and self -correction, reduce the occurrence of illegal acts, and minimize the postponement of postponement or punishment. The intelligent review and monitoring system has become the &quot;first line of defense&quot; for medical institutions to use medical insurance funds. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Comprehensively promoting the intelligent review and monitoring of the Medical Insurance Fund&#39;s intelligent review and monitoring will it affect the people of the people? The person in charge said that in general, the medical insurance department carried out fund supervision work to respect the clinic, and did not affect the normal medical treatment. Intelligent surveillance is &quot;inductive&quot; for participants, and it will not affect normal medical treatment behavior. For clear violations of laws and regulations, it is necessary to strengthen supervision and intervention, and gradually realize the automatic interception of illegal violations of rigid constraints; for problems involving reasonable medical categories, medical insurance departments in various places must fully listen to the opinions and suggestions of pharmaceutical institutions when demonstrating and applied rules. After the system detects the doubts, it is necessary to report it to the designated pharmaceutical institution in time to make a complaint, and to fully listen to the complaints of the pharmaceutical institution and determine whether to pay after the necessary review, acceptance, and final trial procedures. &lt;/p>; &lt;!-/enpcontent->;</description><pubDate> Thu, 16 Nov 2023 06:26:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[02版要闻 - 亚洲最深井获高产油气流]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://paper.people.com.cn/rmrb/html/2023-11/16/nw.D110000renmrb_20231116_3-02.htm]]><description> &lt;div>; Thursday, November 16, 2023 &lt;/div>; &lt;table width = &quot;100%&quot;>; &lt;tBODY>; &lt;lign = &quot;Center&quot;>; &lt;img width = &quot;100%&quot; src = &quot;http: //paper.people.com.cn/rmrb/images/1/2023116/1700080328538_1.jpg &quot;>; &lt;/td>; &lt;/tr>; &lt;TD>; &lt;p>; The picture shows&quot; Deep One &quot;Leap Forward 3 Leap For — 3XC well. &lt;br/>; Chinese Petrochemical Picture &lt;/p>; &lt;/td>; &lt;/tr>; &lt;/tbody>; &lt;/table>; &lt;!-ENPCONTENT->; &lt;p>; Our News, November 15th &amp; nbsp; &amp; nbsp; &amp; nbsp; &amp; nbsp; &amp; nbsp; &amp; nbsp; &amp; nbsp; (Reporter Ran Yongping and Ding Yiting) On the 15th, the Sinopec &quot;Deep One&quot; leap forward 3-3xc well test in the Tarim Basin 3-3xc well test obtained high -yield oil gas flow, Nissan crude oil 200 tons and 50,000 cubic meters of natural gas.
