The exploration and development of mineral resources is related to the national economy, people&#39;s livelihood and national security. As of the end of 2022, 173 minerals have been discovered across the country; nearly 40% of my country&#39;s mineral reserves have increased in 2022... The recently released &quot;China Mineral Resources Report (2023)&quot; shows that my country is advancing the implementation of a new round of mineral prospecting breakthrough strategy The effect of the action is remarkable. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;General Secretary Xi Jinping emphasized: &quot;Intensify exploration efforts, strengthen scientific and technological research, and play a greater role in the new round of strategic actions for mineral prospecting breakthroughs.&quot; Based on ensuring the security of national energy resources, focusing on strengthening domestic exploration and development of important energy and mineral resources and increasing reserves and production, the natural resource system gathers the strength of all parties to fully promote a new round of strategic actions for mineral prospecting breakthroughs to ensure that the energy rice bowl is in its own hands. . &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Comprehensively promote mineral prospecting&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Secure the energy job&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;A new round of mineral prospecting breakthrough strategy What is the point of action? &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“Mineral resources are the cornerstone of building a modern industrial system.” Tang Juxing, deputy chief geologist of the Institute of Mineral Resources of the Chinese Academy of Geological Sciences, said that the development and expansion of strategic emerging industries such as high-end equipment, new energy vehicles, and aerospace will It requires a large amount of copper, aluminum, lithium, manganese and other mineral resources for support. Taking the new energy automobile industry as an example, according to statistics, each vehicle requires an average of 53.2 kg of copper, 8.9 kg of lithium, 39.9 kg of nickel, 24.5 kg of manganese, 13.3 kg of cobalt, 66.3 kg of graphite, and 0.5 kg of rare earths. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;How is the progress of the new round of prospecting breakthrough strategic actions? &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;A set of figures reveals the results: As of the end of 2022, 13 types of energy minerals, 59 types of metal minerals, 95 types of non-metallic minerals, and 6 types of water and gas minerals have been discovered across the country; since the &quot;14th Five-Year Plan&quot;, 8 newly discovered oil fields with a capacity of 100 million tons, 11 gas fields with a capacity of 100 billion cubic meters, 157 large and medium-sized mineral deposits, 112 prospecting prospecting areas have been delineated, and 102 prospecting target areas have been submitted for commercial exploration. &quot;Judging from the current situation, the new round of prospecting breakthrough strategic operations is progressing smoothly, with more than half of the time and half of the tasks, and it is expected to achieve the set goals.&quot; said Xiong Zili, director of the Geological Exploration Management Department of the Ministry of Natural Resources. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Geological prospecting is very difficult. Ding Zhengjiang, Secretary of the Party Committee and Captain of the Sixth Geological Brigade of the Shandong Provincial Bureau of Geology and Mineral Resources, has a metaphor: &quot;A drill bit with a diameter of only a few centimeters drills 3,000 meters deep into a formation with high temperature and pressure. , It&#39;s like hair stuck into the soil.&quot; Since its establishment in 1958, the Sixth Geological Brigade has accumulated a total drilling volume of 5 million meters and a cumulative identified gold resource of more than 2,810 tons. It is the geological team with the largest number of gold finds in the country. The Jiaodong area where it is located has also become the third largest gold-rich area in the world. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The daily life of the prospecting team members is unusual - most of the work is carried out in the wild under difficult conditions, with benches used as beds, dense mosquitoes, and weathering the wind and rain. “You can’t find gold until you travel through the mountains,” Ding Zhengjiang said. “To ensure the authenticity of scientific research in geological prospecting, we must insist on going to wild mining areas, mountains and deserts to obtain first-hand information and original samples.” In the past year, , the Sixth Geological Brigade increased its exploration efforts and carried out deep gold resource potential investigation: a large gold deposit of nearly 50 tons was discovered in Xiluokou, Rushan, Shandong, and helped to detect a super-large lead-zinc mine in Hezhang, Guizhou, and is expected to be submitted 1 medium-sized graphite mine, and 9 gold prospecting target areas have been delineated... At the same time, the team has successively carried out prospecting operations in Xinjiang, Qinghai and other western provinces, and reached 3 mineral rights cooperation projects; in response to the joint construction of the &quot;Belt and Road&quot; initiative, successively Carry out mineral exploration work in Sudan, Nigeria and other countries. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;It is the hard work of the prospecting team that has supported my country’s status as the world’s largest consumer, producer and trading country of mineral resources. Xiong Zili said that only by fully implementing a new round of mineral prospecting breakthrough strategic actions can we firmly hold the energy job in our own hands. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>; &lt;strong>; Relying on scientific and technological innovation&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Leading mineral exploration&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Li Kuan, a young man born in the 1990s, has been working in Shandong The Sixth Geological Brigade of the Provincial Bureau of Geology and Mineral Resources has 8 years of experience in prospecting. Wearing orange field work clothes, after completing the safety inspection before construction, he quickly boarded the machine, &quot;drilling holes, extracting cores, placing numbers...&quot; Li Kuan described his work as &quot;embroidering with a huge machine&quot;. Work: &quot;Drilling rigs more than 10 meters high are scattered in the mountains, working 24 hours a day. It is clear at a glance what the underground stratigraphic structure is and what mineral resources are buried.&quot;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&quot;Traditional emphasis on the &#39;three major pieces of geology&#39; &#39;——Geological hammers, compasses and magnifying glasses. Nowadays, technical means and equipment such as aviation, aerospace, drones, shipboard, ground, and wells have become necessities.&quot; Luo Qingjun, director of the Equipment Department of the China Geological Survey, said that at present, China&#39;s marine geology The level of equipment in fields such as , earth observation, and experimental testing has ranked among the best in the world. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&quot;March into the Deep Earth&quot;. my country&#39;s mineral exploration is shifting from shallow to deep, from looking for outcrops to looking for ores in covered areas, from low mountainous areas to mid-to-high mountains and deep cutting areas, and it needs to rely more on scientific and technological innovation. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Basic theoretical innovation plays an important role in prospecting breakthroughs. Tang Juxing is the chief scientist of national copper prospecting in the new round of prospecting breakthrough strategic action. He has been working in the hinterland of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and adjacent areas for a long time. &quot;We are exploring the establishment of copper mineralization models and exploration models, and theoretical guidance has achieved remarkable results in prospecting breakthroughs. Tibet Copper mines already account for more than 2/3 of my country’s copper resources.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Innovation in institutional mechanisms is a prominent feature of the new round of prospecting breakthrough strategic actions. In 2023, the Ministry of Natural Resources will continue to increase support, give full play to the role of various departments, regions and national geological exploration teams and scientific research units, establish an organization and implementation agency for the mineral prospecting action, and form an expert advisory committee and expert guidance group to provide guidance for the mineral prospecting action. Provide major technical consultation and on-site technical guidance for implementation. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Xiong Zili introduced that the new round of mineral prospecting breakthrough strategic actions focuses on strategic minerals. According to the oil and gas minerals &quot;stabilize the east, strengthen the central, accelerate the west, and expand the sea area&quot;, the solid minerals &quot;explore deep in the east to find blind spots&quot;. , Stable resource supply, key breakthroughs in the western region, new resource bases&quot; overall arrangement, set up basic survey areas, key survey areas, key exploration areas and important mine depths, and carry out basic geological surveys, strategic mineral exploration, mineral resource conservation and comprehensive Utilization, geological prospecting technological innovation and other work. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Strengthening policy support&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Prosperous mining market&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Data show: National lithium mine new projects in 2022 The increase in reserves mainly comes from Jiangxi, accounting for 94.5% of the increase. This is due to the lithium ore prospecting competition carried out in Yifeng County-Fengxin County in Yichun region. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Since 2021, 12 geological teams from Jiangxi Province have invested more than 1,200 engineering and technical personnel and more than 100 drilling rigs in simultaneous construction. Rao Xiaopeng, leader of the drilling team of Maoling Mining Area in Yifeng, said that during the implementation of the project, &quot;wall chart&quot; operations were implemented. Every time a hole is completed, the number is &quot;sold&quot; on the map, and the footage of each drill hole will also be marked on the wall. After more than two years of exploration, a total of 4 super-large-scale and 6 large-scale lithium deposits have been discovered in the Yichun area, with more than 8.58 million tons of lithium resources submitted. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The fruitful lithium ore prospecting results have effectively promoted the vigorous development of Yichun&#39;s lithium battery new energy industry. At present, there are 238 lithium battery new energy production companies in Yichun City, covering lithium mining and processing, positive and negative electrode materials, separators, lithium-ion batteries and accessories, battery recycling and other complete industrial systems, forming a &quot;lithium resource-lithium salt-lithium material- Lithium battery-lithium application-lithium recycling&quot; full industry chain development model. From January to October this year, Yichun City’s lithium battery new energy industry achieved operating income of 88.034 billion yuan, a year-on-year increase of 2.45%. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Bo Zhiping, director of the Mineral Resources Protection and Supervision Department of the Ministry of Natural Resources, said that in the new round of mineral prospecting, mineral exploration will focus more on clean energy and strategic emerging industry resources. The lithium ore prospecting in Yichun is an example of my country&#39;s mining companies deploying new energy and resource deep processing fields: in order to promote exploration and development and increase reserves and production, nearly 20 lithium ore blocks in Sichuan, Yunnan, Xinjiang and other provinces are actively being sold In the preliminary preparation work, we will continue to expand the sources of blocks through various channels such as prospecting target area evaluation and submission to provincial natural resources authorities. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“Mining enterprises are the main body of mineral exploration and shoulder the important task of increasing reserves and production.” Deng Guoping, director of the Mining Rights Management Department of the Ministry of Natural Resources, said that the Ministry of Natural Resources has strengthened policy support to adjust development paths for mining enterprises. Provide guarantees: Effectively reduce the burden on enterprises, the &quot;Measures for the Collection of Income from the Transfer of Mining Rights&quot; has been officially implemented. The method of collection has been changed from a one-time collection when the mining rights are obtained to a year-by-year collection mainly based on sales revenue during mine production; standardize the mining rights transfer system, &quot;Mining Related supporting documents such as &quot;Guidelines for Setting Market Benchmark Prices for Rights Transfer Income&quot; have been released one after another to improve mineral resource exploration and mining policies. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;In the first half of this year, national investment in solid mineral and oil and gas mineral exploration increased by 17.2% and 7.5% respectively year-on-year; 242 new exploration rights were established, a year-on-year increase of 25.4%. Deng Guoping said that encouraging &quot;mine-based prospecting&quot;, canceling the separation and change restrictions on exploration rights, and relaxing restrictions on the transfer of exploration rights will allow more geological exploration units and enterprises with technology, ability, and willingness to obtain exploration rights, thereby accelerating the Exploration and development and increasing reserves and production will secure the main position of ensuring energy supply. &lt;/p>;&lt;!--/enpcontent-->;</description><pubDate> Tue, 28 Nov 2023 05:56:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[02版要闻 - 我国将推进社区嵌入式服务设施建设]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://paper.people.com.cn/rmrb/html/2023-11/28/nw.D110000renmrb_20231128_3-02.htm]]><description> &lt;div>;Tuesday, November 28, 2023&lt;/div>; &lt;!--enpcontent-->;&lt;P>;Our newspaper, Beijing, November 27th&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(Reporter Liu Zhiqiang) The reporter learned from the National Development and Reform Commission on the 26th The General Office of the State Council recently forwarded the National Development and Reform Commission&#39;s &quot;Implementation Plan for the Construction of Embedded Service Facilities in Urban Communities&quot; (hereinafter referred to as the &quot;Plan&quot;), proposing to embed functional facilities and adaptive services in the public spaces of urban communities (communities).
