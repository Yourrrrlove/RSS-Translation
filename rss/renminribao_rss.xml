It is a history of governance for a huge country and also a history of perseverance in flood control. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Looking back since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, &quot;water&quot; is one of the themes that General Secretary Xi Jinping has seen the most. When looking at the regional coordinated development strategy, in addition to classifying it from a regional perspective such as the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region and the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, it is also guided by water systems such as the Yangtze River and the Yellow River. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Why water? Mountains, rivers, forests, fields, lakes, grass and sand, &quot;water is the lifeblood&quot;, the foundation of survival and the source of civilization. &quot;The world is full of water, which floats on the sky and carries the earth. It touches everything high and low, and moistens everything.&quot;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;General Secretary Xi Jinping&#39;s visit to Jiangxi this time was mainly to see the development of the Yangtze River Economic Belt and preside over the The fourth symposium on this theme in the past eight years was held. At the meeting, reviewing the development process, the General Secretary said with emotion:&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&quot;Since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, the Party Central Committee has focused on strategic work, that is, the &#39;big one in the country&#39;, and These tasks have a long cycle. On the other hand, we not only focus on strategies, but also implement them, work hard, be consistent, and achieve results over a long period of time. It does not mean that it is over once the planning is completed, nor does it mean that we only shout slogans without taking action. . We all do it piece by piece, with a comprehensive and systematic layout. To do it, we must do it well and complete it.&quot; &quot;After the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, we focused on work, and this is the spirit!&quot;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Two words , one is &quot;strategy&quot;, and the other is &quot;practice&quot;. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Let’s talk about “strategy” first. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;That year, General Secretary Xi Jinping went to Dongying, Shandong Province to &quot;see the Yellow River flowing into the sea.&quot; Having traveled to the upper, middle and lower reaches of the Yellow River, &quot;I feel at ease.&quot; &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Those who govern the country well must focus on water management. The allocation of time for various tasks is a window for observing the governance of the country. The underlying logic behind spending a lot of time looking at water is the governing philosophy of &quot;the great nation&quot; where the people&#39;s happy life is the basis. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;There is strategic thinking in the water. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The most well-known saying is &quot;lucid waters and lush mountains are worth mountains of gold and silver&quot;. The &quot;two mountains theory&quot; is now deeply rooted in the hearts of the people, and we no longer &quot;judge heroes based on GDP.&quot; From either-or single-choice questions to complementary multiple-choice questions, it contains profound dialectics and is full of strategic foresight. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;What the General Secretary said, &quot;There are as many buns as there are soups to soak in&quot; is also a strategy. It is a vivid expression of &quot;water determines the city, water determines the land, water determines the people, and water determines the production&quot;. Behind it is the water control idea of ​​&quot;water conservation priority, spatial balance, systematic management, and two hands&quot;. Placing water as an important consideration in economic and social development reflects respect for laws and is a symptom of the modernization of governance capabilities. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Grand strategy is bound to be generous. For example, new development concepts, innovation, coordination, green, openness, and sharing are all reflected in water. Speaking only of coordination, at this symposium held in Jiangxi, the General Secretary emphasized “insisting on strengthening regional coordination and integration as the focus.” There will be details at the meeting. The general secretary cordially asked the responsible comrades from 11 provinces and cities how long it took them to get to Nanchang. What used to be a long journey over mountains and rivers now only takes two or three hours. Convenient transportation is the key to coordinated regional development. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Another example is the new development pattern. The blue sea is sailing at Zhoushan Port in Ningbo, Zhejiang, where General Secretary Xi Jinping is brewing a new development pattern of &quot;dual circulation&quot;. Taking the domestic circulation as the main body, during a previous inspection in Sichuan, the General Secretary considered that &quot;our main assets are located along the coast&quot; and thought deeply about the concept of &quot;rear area&quot;. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Strategy includes tactics. How to fight the battle of flood control? &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Look at the map. Water resources are arranged horizontally and vertically. In the east-west direction, following the development strategy of the Yangtze River Economic Belt, General Secretary Xi Jinping proposed the ecological protection and high-quality development strategy of the Yellow River Basin, and the country&#39;s &quot;river strategy&quot; was established. The north-south direction includes the Grand Canal, which connects ancient and modern times, and the South-to-North Water Diversion Project, a century-old project. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;It is criss-crossed, making thousands of waves, and benefiting all directions. Scattered among them are branch-like rivers and dotted lakes. After the founding of New China, our party led the construction of large-scale water conservancy projects. Since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, the water resources allocation pattern has achieved overall optimization. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The system concept is a method of governing the country and a major tactic for water control. &quot;Deal with priorities, when to do what, which ones are urgent tasks, and which ones are strategic reserves.&quot; The general secretary once warned. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The river and lake chief system is a vivid application of the system concept. Comrade Xi Jinping explored the management and protection of rivers and lakes when working at the local level. Zhejiang has therefore become the birthplace of the river chief system. This idea was further expanded after the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, and mountains, rivers, forests, fields, lakes, grass and sand were integrated into the plan. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Look at the second word, &quot;practice diligently&quot;. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;General Secretary Xi Jinping feels deeply about this point:&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“Like our efforts to achieve clear waters and lush mountains, like our fight against poverty and achieve a moderately prosperous society in all respects, like our joint efforts to build the Belt and Road Initiative &#39;, like our major strategies for regional coordinated development... are all done one thing, one thing at a time, and are done meticulously in accordance with the requirements of the Party Central Committee. Of course, they must also go through repeated feedback, demonstration, and testing. As long as the mainstream is If it’s right, just keep doing it.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Keep doing it. The difficulty of controlling water is also a microcosm of the difficulty of governing a country. On the riverside, it is not easy to &quot;change customs and relocate&quot; docks, sand plants, and chemical companies. There are &quot;hard bones&quot; everywhere. Without the perseverance of &quot;driving nails&quot;, without the spirit of &quot;despite the tens of thousands of people, I will go ahead&quot;, without the wisdom of &quot;reaching the broad yet subtle&quot;, how could we have today&#39;s &quot;river of clear water flowing eastward&quot;? &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“The focus cannot be on GDP growth.” “It’s not impossible, but not done.” By governing the country with water management, the reversal of the giant ship channel not only involves changes in development methods, but also affects interests. Breakthrough of barriers and reshaping of development logic. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Only by taking responsibility can we overcome thorns and thorns; only by practicing diligently can we move forward indomitably. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;To practice sincerely, the first thing is faith. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;In this inspection, General Secretary Xi Jinping recalled that since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, all localities and departments &quot;first and foremost are unambiguous about the spirit of the Party Central Committee. Deeply understand, unify their understanding, and resolutely implement the instructions of the Party Central Committee.&quot; Just implement it.&quot;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Comprehensively strengthening party building and strengthening party leadership are unprecedented, and this is the essence of it. The historic achievements and changes that have taken place since the new era have further won the trust of the people. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The &quot;four self-confidences&quot; are also the meaning of the title. The General Secretary once quoted an allusion from &quot;Zhuangzi Qiu Shui&quot; to warn the whole party: &quot;We must not &#39;learn to walk in Handan and lose our old ways&#39;.&quot; The path we are taking is the only correct choice for building a strong country and rejuvenating the nation. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The key to practicing sincerely is to persevere and work hard for a long time. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“A boat sailing against the current”, “A person who travels a hundred miles is half a mile”, “A rolling stone goes up the mountain, and the big stone rolls down if you don’t pay attention”...General Secretary Xi Jinping once used these to describe the hardship and perseverance on the road to national rejuvenation. . &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Water control is a long-term task. From the previous diagnosis that &quot;the Yangtze River is sick&quot; to this time, &quot;the current Yangtze River can only be said to be &#39;recovering from a serious illness&#39;&quot;, the general secretary warned, &quot;You can&#39;t catch it and relax for a while, and then start thinking wrongly when it gets better.&quot;&lt;/ p>;&lt;p>;The test of drawing a blueprint to the end is the concept of political performance. As early as when he was working in Zhejiang, Comrade Xi Jinping used the title &quot;&quot;Latent Achievements&quot; and &quot;Manifest Achievements&quot; in &quot;Zhijiang Xinyu&quot; to discuss &quot;the &#39;manifest achievements&#39; that do not seek quick success and quick benefits, and the creation that benefits future generations.&quot; potential&#39;&quot;. The &quot;Eight-Eight Strategy&quot; that has been consistent for 20 years has achieved outstanding results. &quot;The success does not have to be mine, the success must be mine&quot; is one of the experiences. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“I believe in action.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Emphasizing that the spirit of the Red Flag Canal “will never go out of style”, he pointed out during an inspection of the Three Gorges Project that “for the country to be strong and the nation to be rejuvenated, we must rely on us &quot;Forge ahead and strive unremittingly&quot;... There is a national character of hard work and perseverance in the cause of water control. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The pace will not stop. There is always a sense of worry that &quot;you can&#39;t worry about it all the time&quot;: &quot;The danger of rivers and water sources is a danger to the living environment and the survival of the nation.&quot;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Network, mend the network, strengthen the chain, the national water network The construction is accelerating, and the General Secretary is looking to the farther future, seeking sustainable development and rejuvenation: &quot;The construction of the water network will be another century-long picture of the Chinese nation&#39;s water control process, and will be recorded in the annals of history. ”&lt;/p>;&lt;!--/enpcontent-->; &lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange &quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https:/ /feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 17 Oct 2023 06:56:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[01版要闻 - 中共中央印发《全国干部教育培训规划（2023—2027年）》]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://paper.people.com.cn/rmrb/html/2023-10/17/nw.D110000renmrb_20231017_4-01.htm]]><description> &lt;div>;Tuesday, October 17, 2023&lt;/div>; &lt;TABLE width=&quot;100%&quot;>;&lt;TBODY>;&lt;TR>;&lt;TD align=&quot;center&quot;>;&lt;IMG width=&quot;100%&quot; src=&quot;http: //paper.people.com.cn/rmrb/images/2023-10/17/10/rmrb2023101710p9_b.jpg&quot;>;&lt;/TD>;&lt;/TR>; &lt;TR>;&lt;TD>;&lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;/ TD>;&lt;/TR>;&lt;/TBODY>;&lt;/TABLE>; &lt;TABLE width=&quot;100%&quot;>;&lt;TBODY>;&lt;TR>;&lt;TD align=&quot;center&quot;>;&lt;IMG width=&quot;100%&quot; src=&quot;http: //paper.people.com.cn/rmrb/images/2023-10/17/10/rmrb2023101710p10_b.jpg&quot;>;&lt;/TD>;&lt;/TR>; &lt;TR>;&lt;TD>;&lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;/ TD>;&lt;/TR>;&lt;/TBODY>;&lt;/TABLE>; &lt;TABLE width=&quot;100%&quot;>;&lt;TBODY>;&lt;TR>;&lt;TD align=&quot;center&quot;>;&lt;IMG width=&quot;100%&quot; src=&quot;http: //paper.people.com.cn/rmrb/images/2023-10/17/10/rmrb2023101710p8_b.jpg&quot;>;&lt;/TD>;&lt;/TR>; &lt;TR>;&lt;TD>;&lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;/ TD>;&lt;/TR>;&lt;/TBODY>;&lt;/TABLE>; &lt;TABLE width=&quot;100%&quot;>;&lt;TBODY>;&lt;TR>;&lt;TD align=&quot;center&quot;>;&lt;IMG width=&quot;100%&quot; src=&quot;http: //paper.people.com.cn/rmrb/images/2023-10/17/10/rmrb2023101710p7_b.jpg&quot;>;&lt;/TD>;&lt;/TR>; &lt;TR>;&lt;TD>;&lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;/ TD>;&lt;/TR>;&lt;/TBODY>;&lt;/TABLE>; &lt;TABLE width=&quot;100%&quot;>;&lt;TBODY>;&lt;TR>;&lt;TD align=&quot;center&quot;>;&lt;IMG width=&quot;100%&quot; src=&quot;http: //paper.people.com.cn/rmrb/images/2023-10/17/10/rmrb2023101710p6_b.jpg&quot;>;&lt;/TD>;&lt;/TR>; &lt;TR>;&lt;TD>;&lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;/ TD>;&lt;/TR>;&lt;/TBODY>;&lt;/TABLE>; &lt;TABLE width=&quot;100%&quot;>;&lt;TBODY>;&lt;TR>;&lt;TD align=&quot;center&quot;>;&lt;IMG width=&quot;100%&quot; src=&quot;http: //paper.people.com.cn/rmrb/images/2023-10/17/10/rmrb2023101710p5_b.jpg&quot;>;&lt;/TD>;&lt;/TR>; &lt;TR>;&lt;TD>;&lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;/ TD>;&lt;/TR>;&lt;/TBODY>;&lt;/TABLE>; &lt;TABLE width=&quot;100%&quot;>;&lt;TBODY>;&lt;TR>;&lt;TD align=&quot;center&quot;>;&lt;IMG width=&quot;100%&quot; src=&quot;http: //paper.people.com.cn/rmrb/images/2023-10/17/10/rmrb2023101710p4_b.jpg&quot;>;&lt;/TD>;&lt;/TR>; &lt;TR>;&lt;TD>;&lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;/ TD>;&lt;/TR>;&lt;/TBODY>;&lt;/TABLE>; &lt;!--enpcontent-->;&lt;p>;Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 16th&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Recently, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China issued the &quot;National Cadre Education and Training Plan ( 2023-2027)&quot; (hereinafter referred to as the &quot;Plan&quot;), and issued a notice requiring all regions and departments to conscientiously implement it based on actual conditions. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The notice pointed out that the formulation and implementation of the &quot;Plan&quot; is an important arrangement made by the Party Central Committee focusing on the mission and tasks of the Party in the new era and new journey. We must take the in-depth study and implementation of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era as the main theme and persist in using the party’s innovative theory to condense the heart and soul and strengthen the foundation.

&lt;!--enpcontent-->;&lt;p>;“要把实的要求贯穿主题教育全过程，坚决防止和克服形式主义、官僚主义”，近日在江西考察时，习近平总书记对总结运用第一批主题教育的成功经验、高质量开展第二批主题教育提出明确要求，强调要“实实在在抓好理论学习和调查研究，实实在在检视整改突出问题，实实在在办好惠民利民实事，用实干推动发展、取信于民”。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;实践性是马克思主义的显著特征，求真务实是中国共产党人的重要思想和工作方法。新时代以来，我们党之所以能够团结带领亿万人民攻克许多长期没有解决的难题，办成许多事关长远的大事要事，关键就在于以钉钉子精神抓部署、抓落实、抓督查，不获全胜决不收兵。实践充分表明，“实”乃谋事创业之基、做人做事之本；务实功、出实招、求实效，才能推动发展、取信于民。新征程上，广大党员干部要自觉践行习近平新时代中国特色社会主义思想，熟练掌握其中蕴含的领导方法、思想方法、工作方法，真抓实干、务求实效，聚焦问题、知难而进，努力创造经得起历史和人民检验的实绩。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;理论学习、调查研究是主题教育十分重要的基础环节，又是贯穿主题教育全过程的重点措施。实实在在抓好理论学习和调查研究，就要大力弘扬理论联系实际的马克思主义学风，在推动学习贯彻习近平新时代中国特色社会主义思想走深走实上下功夫。要坚持多思多想、学深悟透，全面学习领会这一重要思想的科学体系、核心要义、实践要求，做到学思用贯通、知信行统一，把看家本领、兴党本领、强国本领学到手。要善于运用党的创新理论研究新情况、解决新问题，大兴务实之风，抓好调查研究，在察实情、出实招、求实效上下功夫，真正把情况摸清、把问题找准、把对策提实，真正把调研成果转化为改进工作、推动发展的实际举措。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;人民群众看主题教育是否有成效，最直观的感受是看党风方面存在的问题是否得到解决、党员干部作风是否有明显进步。实实在在检视整改突出问题，就要坚持目标导向和问题导向相结合、学查改相贯通，以整改的实际成效取信于民。在浙江考察时，习近平总书记指出：“各级党组织要加强对第二批主题教育的组织领导和工作指导，把握不同层级、不同领域、不同对象的特点，结合实际，分类指导，上下联动抓整改，让群众看到实效。”要坚持边学习、边对照、边检视、边整改，对标党风要求找差距、对表党性要求查根源、对照党纪要求明举措，增强检视整改实效，深刻检视剖析、深挖思想根源、深入整改落实。要把自己摆进去、把职责摆进去、把工作摆进去，抓好突出问题的专项整治，敢于动真碰硬，防止久拖不决、整而不改。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;为民造福是中国共产党人最大政绩。实实在在办好惠民利民实事，就要牢固树立以人民为中心的发展思想，以推动高质量发展的新成效检验主题教育成果。要坚持一切为了人民、一切依靠人民，自觉问计于民、问需于民，始终同人民同呼吸、共命运、心连心，通过做大“蛋糕”不断增进民生福祉，着力解决人民群众急难愁盼问题，把惠民生、暖民心、顺民意的工作做到群众心坎上。要树牢造福人民的政绩观，不搞贪大求洋、盲目蛮干、哗众取宠；坚持出实招求实效，不搞华而不实、投机取巧、数据造假；坚持打基础利长远，不搞急功近利、竭泽而渔、劳民伤财。要把为老百姓办了多少好事实事作为检验政绩的重要标准，让中国式现代化建设成果更多更公平地惠及全体人民。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;在江西考察时，习近平总书记强调：“用井冈山精神、苏区精神、长征精神砥砺党员、干部，教育引导党员、干部坚定理想信念、牢记初心使命、积极开拓进取、勇于担当作为。”历史川流不息，精神代代相传。当前我国发展进入战略机遇和风险挑战并存、不确定难预料因素增多的时期，必须准备经受风高浪急甚至惊涛骇浪的重大考验。越是任务艰巨、挑战严峻，越要大力弘扬伟大建党精神，赓续红色血脉、传承奋斗精神。要坚持不懈用习近平新时代中国特色社会主义思想凝心铸魂，深刻领会这一重要思想关于坚定理想信念、提升思想境界、加强党性锻炼等一系列要求，始终保持共产党人的政治本色，始终保持锐意进取、敢为人先、迎难而上的奋斗姿态，依靠顽强斗争打开事业发展新天地。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;大道至简，实干为要。我们靠实干创造了辉煌的过去，还要靠实干开创更加美好的未来。从习近平新时代中国特色社会主义思想中汲取奋发进取的智慧和力量，凝聚起求真务实、担当作为、干事创业的强大正能量，我们一定能够胜利推进强国建设、民族复兴的历史伟业，不断创造无愧于党、无愧于人民、无愧于时代的新业绩。&lt;/p>;&lt;!--/enpcontent-->;</description><pubDate> Tue, 17 Oct 2023 06:56:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[01版要闻 - 李强分别同匈牙利总理欧尔班、埃塞俄比亚总理阿比、巴布亚新几内亚总理马拉佩会谈]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://paper.people.com.cn/rmrb/html/2023-10/17/nw.D110000renmrb_20231017_6-01.htm]]><description> &lt;div>;2023年10月17日星期二&lt;/div>;
