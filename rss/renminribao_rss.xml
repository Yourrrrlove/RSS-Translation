Faced with endless global challenges, the international community has become increasingly eager for common development, and the concept of common development has become increasingly popular in practice. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;On September 21, 2021, President Xi Jinping delivered an important speech at the general debate of the 76th United Nations General Assembly, proposing a global development initiative to promote the international community to form a synergy and solve the development deficit problem. The realization of the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development has contributed Chinese solutions and Chinese wisdom. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The road is never isolated, and together we can go far. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;In the two years since the Global Development Initiative was proposed, it has effectively built an international consensus on jointly promoting development, responded to the most urgent needs of the international community, and has been widely praised by the international community. The proposal and implementation of global development initiatives conform to the wishes of the people, inject more impetus into the world&#39;s joint development, and demonstrate China&#39;s responsibility. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Coping with global challenges&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Contributing Chinese wisdom&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Development carries the people’s yearning for a better life , is the top priority for developing countries and an eternal theme of human society. The century-old changes are accelerating and the historical trend of the collective rise of developing countries is irreversible. The voice and willingness to unite, cooperate and seek common development have never been stronger. How to solve the development deficit and solve the development dilemma has become an era issue facing human society. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“I proposed the global development initiative to focus the world on development and provide assistance for the implementation of the sustainable development agenda.” From September 2021, it was proposed at the general debate of the 76th United Nations General Assembly Global development initiative, by presiding over the Global Development High-Level Dialogue in June 2022 to announce 32 pragmatic measures, and by attending the &quot;BRICS+&quot; Leaders&#39; Dialogue in August 2023 to make important expositions on global development cooperation, President Xi Jinping has always focused on the world. In order to achieve the long-term goal and practical needs of common development, we propose the global development initiative and continuously enrich its connotation, leading the promotion of this major initiative to take root, deepening and practicality, and injecting strong impetus into promoting the common development of all countries. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;On the occasion of the second anniversary of the launch of the Global Development Initiative, a high-level meeting to showcase the cooperation results of the Global Development Initiative was held at the United Nations Headquarters in New York on the 19th local time. Xinhua News Agency’s national high-end think tank released the &quot;Global Development Initiative&quot; during the meeting &quot;Practical Achievements and World Contribution&quot; think tank report comprehensively reviews the fruitful results achieved by the Global Development Initiative in the two years since it was proposed, and systematically elaborates on the concepts, principles and world significance of this major initiative. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Wang Xiaojun, director of the Fund of the United Nations Office for South-South Cooperation who attended the meeting, said in an interview with Xinhua News Agency that the cases shown in the report show that global development initiatives have brought benefits to people all over the world, including the construction in Mongolia Livable housing, supporting school meals in Nepal and Cambodia, launching the “Bamboo Replaces Plastic” campaign in African countries, providing COVID-19 vaccine assistance to Palestinian refugees, etc. These cases vividly demonstrate the comprehensive scope of cooperation in global development initiatives. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Wang Xiaojun believes that the concept of the Global Development Initiative is highly in line with the needs of today&#39;s world. It has created a new model of open and inclusive international development cooperation in terms of building global partnerships for South-South and trilateral cooperation. The world is facing complex challenges, and global development initiatives have made a strong contribution to placing development issues at the center of the international agenda. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Robert Lawrence Kuhn, chairman of the Kuhn Foundation in the United States, said that the global development initiative is based on China’s own development experience, solves global development problems, and at the same time benefits the majority of developing countries through specific actions, and has a great impact on the world. Development has important practical significance. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“President Xi Jinping’s initiative will bring the hard-hit sustainable development goals back to the core of the global multilateral agenda.” Solomon Islands Prime Minister Sogavare said. Former Slovenian President Turk said: &quot;China&#39;s global development initiatives provide key constructive force to address global development challenges.&quot;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;We are committed to achieving stronger, greener and healthier global development and jointly create A development pattern that is inclusive, balanced, coordinated and inclusive, win-win cooperation, and common prosperity. Since the global development initiative was proposed, the concept has been continuously enriched, the implementation mechanism has been continuously improved, the promotion path has become clearer, and pragmatic cooperation has gradually been implemented, effectively responding to global challenges and development needs of developing countries. Melaku Mulualem, a senior fellow at the Ethiopian Institute of Strategic Affairs, said: &quot;Whether it is thought leadership or implementation, the global development initiative provides a clear roadmap for countries.&quot;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;As the world As the largest developing country in the world and a natural member of the Global South, China has always placed its own development in the coordinate system of human development, adhered to the people-centered development concept, actively shared experience with other countries, provided assistance, and promoted global South-South cooperation. Steady and far-reaching progress. From deepening international cooperation in the fight against the epidemic to assisting international poverty reduction; from helping African and other developing countries to alleviate debt pressure, to promoting global trade, digital economy, green transformation, and ensuring food and energy security, China has always worked closely with the vast number of developing countries. Countries work side by side to make positive contributions to global development. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Nicaraguan President Ortega said: &quot;China&#39;s help to the people of Asia, Africa and Latin America has no strings attached and has made important contributions to promoting social progress and people&#39;s well-being in developing countries.&quot; British International Relations Consultant Keith Bennett said: “President Xi Jinping’s concepts of ‘people-centeredness’ and ‘strive to leave no country behind’ are crucial to improving the fairness, effectiveness, and inclusiveness of global development, and are highly regarded by the international community. Widely recognized and generally welcomed.&quot;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Cracking development bottlenecks&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Injecting Chinese power&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;In the new era of COVID-19 Affected by negative factors such as the epidemic, intensified geopolitical conflicts, &quot;decoupling and disconnection&quot; promoted by the United States and the West, and extreme fiscal and monetary policies, global development bottlenecks have become increasingly prominent in recent years, global poverty reduction results have been affected, the growth rate of some emerging markets has slowed, and food The energy crisis and other challenges are intertwined, and high inflation has made people&#39;s livelihood in many countries difficult. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“The root cause of world chaos is the lack of development.” David Monyaei, director of the Africa-China Research Center at the University of Johannesburg, South Africa, said, “Promoting the implementation of global development initiatives will help reduce challenges and alleviate Crisis, thereby strengthening our security.&quot;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Weisheng Zhou, a professor at Ritsumeikan University in Japan, believes that as a developing country, China has accumulated a lot of valuable development experience in the process of reform and opening up for more than 40 years. The global development initiative is based on both China&#39;s development experience and the goal of sustainable human development, and is of great practical significance and operability. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“The Global Development Initiative focuses on development bottlenecks, and relevant countries have benefited a lot from it.” Kuhn, who has long been concerned about China’s development, believes that China’s professional knowledge and experience provide long-term and critical support to developing countries. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The Global Development Initiative focuses on key areas such as green development, new industrialization, and digital economy, promotes partnership building for the new industrial revolution, and supports high-quality development. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;In Southeast Asia and Africa, Chinese companies rely on new business formats such as cloud computing, e-commerce, and financial technology to promote economic and trade exchanges between all parties and help optimize the local development environment. In Latin America and Central Asia, Chinese companies have participated in projects such as wind farms, hydropower stations, and photovoltaic power stations to help local areas transition to low-carbon. In many places around the world, connectivity has achieved fruitful results. Cooperation projects such as the China-Laos Railway and the Stentrang-Grochima Mekong River Bridge in Cambodia have greatly facilitated local transportation and played a significant role in promoting economic and social development. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Sikun, a senior Lao diplomat, said that the world today is still facing challenges such as the sluggish post-epidemic recovery and the Ukraine crisis, and Laos has also been affected. However, because of the China-Laos railway, Laos’ tourism industry has been able to recover quickly, and goods Smoother transportation has helped Laos&#39; economy recover more quickly from numerous challenges. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“China has always been sincere and took positive actions to help countries get rid of poverty.” Ronny Lins, director of the Brazilian Center for China Studies, said that in the two years since the Global Development Initiative was proposed, China has been promoting the global South. In terms of development, it has shown stronger action, created more development opportunities for developing countries including Latin American countries, and played a role in improving people&#39;s livelihood, which is conducive to the sustainable development of the world economy and human society. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Waleed Jabala, a professor of economics and financial law at Cairo University in Egypt, said that China has proposed solutions for development, and many countries hope to use these &quot;keys&quot; to solve their development problems. &quot;We can see China&#39;s initiatives reflected in real projects every day.&quot;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>; &lt;strong>;Let&#39;s start a new development path together&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >; &lt;strong>; &lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Showing China’s Responsibility&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The more complex and severe the international situation becomes, the more countries need to adhere to true multilateralism. Global development is inseparable from international cooperation. China holds high the banner of multilateralism, gathers global development forces with the concepts of openness, inclusiveness, and win-win cooperation, and demonstrates its responsibility as a major country. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Helga Zepp LaRouche, founder and chairman of the German think tank Schiller Institute, believes that the current world must stop brinkmanship and get rid of unilateralism. President Xi Jinping&#39;s global development initiative and many other proposals are conducive to resolving the current dilemma. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“The international community must serve the interests of the world and the people at heart, and push development issues back to the core of the international agenda.” China has provided development assistance to more than 160 countries and cooperated with more than 150 countries. Countries have joined hands to build the Belt and Road Initiative, and have jointly promoted cooperation on global development initiatives with more than 100 countries and international organizations. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;At the &quot;BRICS+&quot; leaders&#39; dialogue held not long ago, President Xi Jinping announced that China has established a global development and South-South cooperation fund totaling US$4 billion, and Chinese financial institutions are about to launch a US$10 billion fund. US dollars are earmarked for the implementation of global development initiatives. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;From Asia to Africa, from Pacific island countries to the Caribbean coast, more than 200 cooperation projects have come to fruition, and cooperation mechanisms in poverty reduction, education, health and other fields have continued to expand. China launched the China-UN Food and Agriculture Organization South-South Cooperation Trust Fund to implement special actions to promote food production and share agricultural technical knowledge; it launched a global clean energy partnership to help achieve energy security. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>; Regarding the global development initiative, President Xi Jinping said: &quot;This initiative is a public good open to the world, aiming to align with the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and promote common global development. China is willing to join hands with all parties Cooperate to jointly promote the implementation of initiatives and strive not to leave any country behind.&quot;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Jabala has deep feelings about this. He said that the global development initiative aims to guide the world towards a better future by promoting cooperation and building partnerships, which reflects the inclusive spirit of the Chinese people. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The Chinese nation pursues &quot;the great road and the world is for the common good&quot;, advocates &quot;being kind to neighbors and harmonious to all nations&quot;, and advocates &quot;working in harmony and helping each other&quot;. The Global Development Initiative is rooted in this excellent traditional Chinese culture and is committed to promoting the international community to continuously enhance cooperation consensus, strengthen the docking of development strategies at all levels, broaden cooperation channels, and ultimately achieve joint development and common progress. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Virtue is never alone, it must have neighbors. At present, more than 100 countries and international organizations support the global development initiative, and more than 70 countries have joined the &quot;Group of Friends of the Global Development Initiative&quot;. The global development initiative has been included in a series of cooperation between China and Central Asia, ASEAN, Africa, Latin America, Pacific Island countries, etc. Document... China is willing to work with all progressive forces in the world to build a high-quality global development partnership that is united, equal, balanced and beneficial to all, start a new journey of building a global development community with a shared future, and jointly move towards a more prosperous and better future. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;(Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, September 20) -/enpcontent-->;</description><pubDate> Thu, 21 Sep 2023 06:26:06 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[01版要闻 - 中国企业500强营收超108万亿元（新数据 新看点）]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://paper.people.com.cn/rmrb/html/2023-09/21/nw.D110000renmrb_20230921_2-01.htm]]><description> &lt;div>;Thursday, September 21, 2023&lt;/div>; &lt;TABLE width=&quot;100%&quot;>;&lt;TBODY>;&lt;TR>;&lt;TD align=&quot;center&quot;>;&lt;IMG width=&quot;100%&quot; src=&quot;http: //paper.people.com.cn/rmrb/images/2023-09/21/01/rmrb2023092101p17_b.jpg&quot;>;&lt;/TD>;&lt;/TR>; &lt;TR>;&lt;TD>;&lt;p>;Data source: China Enterprises United Meeting with China Entrepreneurs Association&lt;BR/>;Drawing: Zhang Fangman&lt;/p>;&lt;/TD>;&lt;/TR>;&lt;/TBODY>;&lt;/TABLE>; &lt;!--enpcontent-->;&lt;P>;Hefei September of this newspaper Report on the 20th (Reporter Liu Zhiqiang) The China Enterprise Confederation and the China Entrepreneurs Association released the 2023 Top 500 Chinese Enterprises list in Hefei, Anhui Province on the 20th.

Big decisions made by FE. It is necessary to adapt to changes in the situation and tasks, focus on consolidating and expanding the results of poverty alleviation, comprehensively promote rural revitalization, and deepen cooperation between the east and the west and targeted assistance. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Since Guangzhou City of Guangdong Province paired up with Qiannan Buyi and Miao Autonomous Prefecture of Guizhou Province in 2013, in the past 10 years, the east-west collaboration work of Guangzhou City has gradually expanded to Bijie City and Anshun City of Guizhou Province, and cooperation projects have been carried out one after another. The land of Guizhou has taken root. In addition, the two provinces of Guangdong and Fujian jointly issued a counterpart cooperation implementation plan between Guangzhou City and Longyan City at the beginning of this year. Later, the two cities signed a counterpart cooperation framework agreement, clarifying cooperation in ten key areas. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Measure the distance between mountains and sea and explore the answer to rural revitalization. Recently, reporters visited Fujian and Guizhou provinces to feel the &quot;Guangzhou mark&quot; on the road to common prosperity. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>; &lt;strong>; &quot;One out, one in&quot; to make up for the shortcomings&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;In 2007, the first laying hen farm was put into operation; now, it has 1.5 million eggs The daily production capacity of Bijie Shengyuan Egg Industry Co., Ltd. is the development speed of Bijie Shengyuan Egg Industry Co., Ltd. Due to their high quality and good taste, the eggs produced by the company are in short supply in the Guangzhou market. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Contrary to the current hot demand, before 2016, Shengyuan Egg Industry’s eggs could only be sold to other sellers and entered the Guangzhou market under OEM brands. &quot;Until the beginning of 2017, under the coordination of the Guangzhou East-West Poverty Alleviation Cooperation Working Group in Bijie, supermarkets in Guangzhou began to purchase our eggs directly.&quot; Zhang Yongjian, the person in charge of Shengyuan Egg Industry, said that the company then ushered in a new stage of rapid development. . &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Developing characteristic industries is an important way to achieve rural revitalization. &quot;In the past, due to factors such as small production scale, high transportation costs, and weak brand effects, the contradiction between &#39;good quality and high price&#39; for Guizhou&#39;s agricultural and sideline products was prominent.&quot; Zhang Shixue, director of the Comprehensive Research Division of the Guangzhou Municipal Cooperation Office, introduced the Guangdong-Guizhou Cooperation Task Force The Guangzhou Group has promoted many high-quality local products including eggs, vegetables, rice, pumpkins, etc., to &quot;go out of the mountains&quot; through a series of measures such as cultivating business entities, improving product quality, building consumption platforms, and enriching consumption scenarios. Data show that in the first eight months of this year, Guangzhou’s sales of assistance products from Bijie, Qiannan, and Anshun reached 6.57 billion yuan. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;In order to take into account both agricultural production and have a more stable income channel, the key is to bring industrial projects into villages. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Affix labels to clothes, press the machine to press the logo, tear off the remaining plastic sheets, and put the clothes into the basket... The whole work process is orderly. As a staff member of the quality department of Tifel Clothing Co., Ltd. in Duyun City, Qiannan Province, Yang Naying is very satisfied with her job. &quot;It is close to home and I can participate in leisure activities with my family during holidays.&quot; &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Yang Naying is not an exception. As a garment company with more than 260 workers, 80% of the workers at Tifel Clothing Company live within 3 kilometers of the factory. In Guizhou, where a large number of people are relocating, companies like Tifel Clothing are becoming an important help for local people to move, live stably, and become rich. Data show that in 2022, Bijie, Qiannan, and Anshun will introduce 193 new investment enterprises from Guangdong, with an actual investment of 8.289 billion yuan, absorbing 17,645 rural labor jobs. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>; &lt;strong>; &quot;One extension, one liter&quot; forged long plate&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Quality and health attributes are the advantages of Guizhou&#39;s agricultural products, but the sales of primary agricultural products have always faced a lack of added value. Problems such as high temperature and many seasonal restrictions. To this end, the Guangzhou Group of the Guangdong-Guizhou Cooperation Task Force strives to keep value-added benefits in rural areas and for farmers by extending the industrial chain. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Spring water with a temperature of less than 20 degrees Celsius gushes out from the mountains. After passing through artificial ditches, it becomes faster and rushes into the contiguous fish ponds. Sturgeons of different sizes swim among them, splashing out from time to time. This is Jiaqi Aquatic Products Breeding Co., Ltd. in Huishui County, Guizhou. In the workshop not far from the fish pond, more than 30 workers are busy. The processed sturgeon will be divided into skin, bones, meat and other parts, and transported to Guangzhou through cold chain logistics. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“Sturgeon processing and cooking requirements are high, and it is difficult for ordinary families to prepare sturgeon dishes by themselves, so we have been selling to catering companies, but sales have never increased.” Huishui County Sturgeon Association President Zhang Cuilan introduced that in March 2021, a food processing company from Guangzhou came to Huishui County, and the two parties hit it off and used sturgeon meat to make fish balls. &quot;After improving several key aspects such as taste and packaging, our fish ball products have been widely praised by the market, driving the price of sturgeon out of the pond from a low of about 9 yuan per catty to about 20 yuan today.&quot;&lt;/ p>;&lt;p>;Similar to sturgeon, Guizhou&#39;s local specialty fruit prickly pear is used as raw material. Guangzhou Pharmaceutical Group has developed a series of products called &quot;Cixing Ningji&quot;. Sales revenue will reach 1.2 billion yuan in 2022, driving the prickly pear planting area to exceed 2 million acres, benefiting 65,000 farmers, helping Guizhou prickly pear become a tens-billion-yuan industry. &quot;GPharma Group provides strong support for strengthening, replenishing and extending the chain, thereby driving upstream and downstream industries to share value-added dividends.&quot; said Ye Jizeng, deputy general manager of Wanglaoji Health Company of GPHL. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;As an important domestic tourism destination, Guizhou’s tourism industry plays an important role in promoting high-quality development. Focusing on improving tourism industrialization and service capabilities, Guangzhou has actively explored aspects such as financial support and team building. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;In the Millennium Buyi Ancient Village Scenic Area, a national 4A-level scenic spot located in Gaodang Village, Zhenning Buyi and Miao Autonomous County, Anshun City, villager Wu Wenfenzheng and her daughter Yang Pinglian make batik crafts. After entering September, the number of tourists in the scenic spot dropped compared with the summer vacation, so they had free time to make new batik works. In the past two months, July and August, their batik experience classes have welcomed batches of tourists. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Since 2021, thanks to the assistance and cooperation of Yuexiu District, Guangzhou City, Gaodang Village has been successfully selected as a demonstration site for the in-depth integration of rural tourism with traditional villages and ethnic minority characteristic villages in Guizhou Province in 2022. With the help of East-West With the cooperation funds from the Ministry of Education, we have improved the construction of infrastructure such as bonfire squares and camping bases. Not only that, Guangzhou Guangzheng International Travel Service Co., Ltd., a subsidiary of Lingnan Business Travel Group, has also dispatched a dedicated team to Gaodang Village to help Gaodang Village comprehensively improve its tourist resources, tourism product development, and service standards.
