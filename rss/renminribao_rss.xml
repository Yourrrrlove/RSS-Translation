In order to learn more about post-disaster recovery and reconstruction, in order to learn more about the same situation. Face-to-face communication with disaster-stricken people. &lt;/P>;&lt;P>;&quot;During that time, I paid attention to the disaster every day and guided the relief work. I was always thinking about the disaster-stricken areas and the affected people. I said at that time that when the post-disaster recovery and reconstruction reached a certain stage, we must Let&#39;s see again.&quot;&lt;/P>;&lt;P>;&quot;Especially in winter, can people stay safe and warm through the winter? What other difficulties are there in life?&quot;&lt;/P>;&lt;P>;November 10, the day after the beginning of winter.

Five months later, on the day before the Great Cold, the General Secretary came to the epicenter canyon after a bumpy journey. &lt;/P>;&lt;P>;I still remember that the flood situation in Anhui in 2020 was serious. One month later, under the scorching sun, I visited the 800-mile Chaohu embankment. &lt;/P>;&lt;P>;I still remember that there will be rare heavy rains in Shanxi in 2021. Three months later, just after the Lunar New Year, I walked along the winding mountain road and braved the snow to both sides of the Fen River. &lt;/P>;&lt;P>;When the storm hits, who is the most reliable backbone? Who is the real hero? &lt;/P>;&lt;P>;During this inspection, General Secretary Xi Jinping attended a theme class meeting for children at Miaofengshan National School.

The reality of flood fighting and disaster relief is the most infectious &quot;ideological and political lesson&quot;. &lt;/P>;&lt;P>;&quot;The Communist Party of China has always been the people&#39;s party. In times of crisis, our party&#39;s organizations and party members and cadres at all levels will be on the front line for the people.&quot;&lt;/P>;&lt;P>;&quot;Especially Once there is a disaster, there are two that stand out the most: one is our people&#39;s soldiers, and the other is our party organizations at all levels and the majority of party members and cadres under the red flag.&quot;&lt;/P>;&lt;P>;Every word, every word, speaks loudly; every move, every action, Keep your promise. &lt;/P>;&lt;P>;These are the words from the heart of the people——&lt;/P>;&lt;P>;The home of Li Meng, a villager in Shuiyuzui Village, has been renovated and tidied up.

The Chinese nation has struggled with natural disasters for thousands of years. It has experienced hardships and hardships. Not only has it never been crushed, but it has stood up unyieldingly in disasters and built our nation. Perseverance. &lt;/P>;&lt;P>;Dong Caiying told the general secretary that the house was flooded and she was quite scared to be alone at home. The neighbors upstairs knocked on the door again and again to ask if she was okay, helped her move things, and let her stay in their house. &lt;/P>;&lt;P>;General Secretary Xi Jinping was deeply moved: &quot;In the face of disasters, our people are extremely strong. And in the process of disaster relief, everyone works together and helps each other.&quot;&lt;/P>;&lt;P>;In Miaofengshan Nationality School, on the embankment by the Baigou River, General Secretary Xi Jinping cordially visited and expressed condolences to representatives from all walks of life involved in flood prevention and relief. &lt;/P>;&lt;P>;&quot;Camouflage green&quot;, &quot;flame blue&quot;, &quot;rescue red&quot;... rush to help wherever there is need, and fight wherever the crisis is most critical. &lt;/P>;&lt;P>;&quot;When the sea is flowing, heroes show their true qualities. When one side is in trouble, all parties support it. There are countless supporting teams. It is no longer clear which organization, which aspect and where they come from.&quot; General Secretary explain. &lt;/P>;&lt;P>;&quot;Difficulties are not enough to be feared, but determination is stronger than iron.&quot; This is what the cadres and the masses said during the interview in Mentougou. &lt;/P>;&lt;P>;&quot;I am a son and daughter of Yanzhao, and I want to fight for Hebei.&quot; This is an eye-catching slogan on the streets of Zhuozhou City. &lt;/P>;&lt;P>;The house was flooded and renovated; it collapsed and was rebuilt on the spot; the shop was flooded and quickly resumed business; the crops were flooded and they took advantage of the farming season to replant...&lt;/P>;&lt;P>;In In the pharmacy and supermarket at the entrance of Yongji Xiuyuan Community, when the general secretary asked the shopkeeper &quot;what other difficulties are there&quot;, the answer he got was &quot;we are confident that the future will definitely get better and better.&quot; &lt;/P>;&lt;P>;When leaving Wanquanzhuang Village, enthusiastic villagers crowded on both sides of the road, surrounded the General Secretary, and greeted the General Secretary loudly. Among the crowd, there were white-haired old people, young boys who were still childlike, and young children still in their arms. &lt;/P>;&lt;P>;Facing the villagers, the General Secretary described his feelings at the end of the day: &quot;I see hope from everyone&#39;s expressions.

&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;中国的开放和发展与亚太紧密相连，中国始终是亚太区域经济合作的坚定支持者和积极推动者，将自身发展与区域发展紧密结合，以自身对外开放带动区域整体开放。 2013年以来，习近平主席在亚太经合组织平台上，始终强调开放包容、合作共赢，推动亚太合作朝着正确方向前进——&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“亚太经合组织是一个大家庭，打造发展创新、增长联动、利益融合的开放型亚太经济格局，符合所有成员共同利益。为了实现上述目标，亚太经济体需要共同构建互信、包容、合作、共赢的亚太伙伴关系，为亚太地区和世界经济发展增添动力。”9年前，燕山脚下，雁栖湖畔，习近平主席指出，“亚太发展前景取决于今天的决断和行动。我们有责任为本地区人民创造和实现亚太梦想。”亚太伙伴关系和亚太梦想的确立，是亚太区域合作和亚太地区处理国家关系理念的重大进步，为亚太地区长远发展和共同繁荣勾画新愿景，指引新方向，注入新动力。

&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;23天，行程2万公里，这是“樱桃快航”货轮运送智利车厘子进入中国的时间，比10年前缩短了10天左右。在疫后经济复苏的关键时刻，这些跨越南北半球的一颗颗水果，是中国经济与亚太经济始终相互依存、深度融合的见证。根据亚洲开发银行发布的《2023年亚洲经济一体化报告》，亚太地区经济今年上半年的复苏很大程度上得益于中国，中国对该地区的经济增长贡献率达64.2%。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“中方对于经济规律和市场原则的尊重，给亚太经济体树立了榜样”“中国坚持真正的多边主义、坚定维护多边贸易体制，将助力推进亚太自由贸易区进程”“中国在推动区域经济一体化方面起到的作用是如此重要，在这个时间点，我们需要中国在亚太、在全球引领这一进程”“中国积极支持全球与区域经济复苏，亚太地区实现和平稳定与繁荣发展离不开中国贡献”……在当前国际环境下，国际人士对于中国经济与亚太合作的生动观察，凸显“亚太是个大家庭，中国是大家庭中的一员。中国发展离不开亚太，亚太繁荣也离不开中国”。

&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;亚太经合组织首次领导人会议召开30年来，在世界经济大潮中，亚太经合组织为构建开放型世界经济、支持多边贸易体制、引领经济全球化发挥了积极作用。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;正如太平洋因联通四海而活力澎湃，开放是亚太合作的生命线。推进区域经济一体化，构建亚太命运共同体，实现社会稳定和生活幸福是亚太各国的共同追求和愿望。

“我希望这条路给我带来更美好的生活。”当地居民对未来的生活更有盼头；&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;柬埔寨东部磅湛省出产的香蕉绝大部分运往中国市场。随着越来越多的新鲜水果相继获准出口中国，柬埔寨水果种植业发展迅速。柬埔寨农林渔业大臣邓迪那表示，水果出口中国市场，对柬埔寨而言是重要机遇；&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;…………&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“太平洋之所以广大，是因为它没有任何自然阻隔，我们不应该为它设定人为的阻隔。”“亚太是我们共同发展的空间，我们都是亚太这片大海中前行的风帆。亚太未来发展攸关亚太经合组织每个成员的利益。”“中国愿同所有国家在相互尊重、平等互利的基础上和平共处、共同发展。”“中国将坚定不移推动构建亚太命运共同体，为亚太稳定繁荣作出更多贡献。”从2013年强调牢固树立亚太命运共同体意识，到2014年倡导共建互信、包容、合作、共赢的亚太伙伴关系，再到2019年提出构建开放包容、创新增长、互联互通、合作共赢的亚太命运共同体；从2021年全面阐述构建亚太命运共同体深刻内涵，到2022年提出建设关于亚太未来发展与合作重大主张，中国始终高举构建亚太命运共同体旗帜，引领亚太合作方向。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;构建亚太命运共同体倡导真正的多边主义、坚持开放的区域主义，受到亚太各方的高度赞赏和支持：“反映了地区人民求和平、谋合作的共同心声，有助于维护亚太合作正确方向，体现了中国作为大国的责任担当”“开放的亚太需要各经济体携手构建开放包容、创新增长、互联互通、合作共赢的亚太命运共同体”“我们期待中国推动各方朝着构建亚太命运共同体目标迈进，携手开创亚太经济合作新篇章”……&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;大国之大，在于责任重大。美国是亚太经合组织第三十次领导人非正式会议的东道主。中美两国是全球前两大经济体，经济总量超过世界1/3、人口总数占世界近1/4、双边贸易额约占世界1/5，在驱动亚太经济增长、促进亚太区域合作中发挥着独特的重要作用。宽广的地球完全容得下中美各自发展、共同繁荣。中美关系真正稳下来、好起来，不仅符合两国和两国人民根本利益，也将为亚太乃至世界的和平与繁荣发挥建设性作用。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;党的二十大报告提出：“推动世界贸易组织、亚太经合组织等多边机制更好发挥作用，扩大金砖国家、上海合作组织等合作机制影响力，增强新兴市场国家和发展中国家在全球事务中的代表性和发言权。”面对世界经济不稳定性不确定性明显增强，一个脚踏实地、勇毅前行的中国，将为充满不确定性的世界带来更多稳定性与正能量；一个自信开放、奋发有为的中国，将以自身新发展为世界提供新机遇、新动力；一个胸怀天下、笃行担当的中国，将为促进人类和平与发展、繁荣与进步带来新启迪、新希望。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;***&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;***&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“知者不惑，仁者不忧，勇者不惧。”世界又一次站在历史的十字路口，新形势下，亚太各经济体要汲取历史经验和教训，因应时代挑战，坚定推进区域经济一体化，共同开拓发展新局面，构建亚太命运共同体，以亚太地区的稳定和繁荣，为世界的和平与发展贡献智慧和力量。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;浩渺行无极，扬帆但信风。中国愿同地区伙伴一道，坚持真正的多边主义、开放的区域主义，以自身发展带动他人发展，以协调联动最大限度发挥各自优势，推动亚太成为合作发展的高地，为亚太和全球可持续发展注入更强劲的动力。 &lt;/p>;&lt;!--/enpcontent-->;</description><pubDate> Mon, 13 Nov 2023 06:26:05
