In response to the current situation, President Xi Jinping pointed out that the top priorities are: first, all parties to the conflict must immediately cease fire and fighting, stop all violence and attacks against civilians, release detained civilians, and avoid more serious loss of life. The second is to ensure the safe and smooth flow of humanitarian relief channels, provide more humanitarian assistance to the Gaza people, and stop forced relocation, water, electricity and oil cuts and other collective punishments against the Gaza people.

China&#39;s series of propositions have been widely appreciated by international people. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Ahmed Ibrahim, a Saudi expert on international issues, said: “President Xi Jinping’s speech once again shows that China stands on the side of peace and justice on the Palestinian-Israeli issue, and always insists on promoting peace. talks and calls on all parties to cease fire and end the war as soon as possible.&quot;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&quot;The proposals put forward by President Xi Jinping provide ideas for resolving the cycle of Palestinian-Israeli conflicts.&quot; Historian, University of Buenos Aires, Argentina Nestor Restivo, editor-in-chief of &quot;Contemporary&quot; magazine, said that under the guidance of the concept of building a community with a shared future for mankind, China has always advocated the peaceful settlement of international disputes and advocated dialogue and cooperation. China and other BRICS countries have made unremitting efforts to restore the peace process. The Palestinian-Israeli issue must be resolved jointly by the international community. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;President Xi Jinping emphasized that the fundamental reason why the situation between Palestine and Israel has developed to this day is that the Palestinian people&#39;s rights to statehood, survival, and return have been ignored for a long time. The fundamental way out to resolve the recurring conflict between Palestine and Israel is to implement the &quot;two-state solution&quot;, restore the legitimate rights of the Palestinian nation, and establish an independent Palestinian state. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Homat, director of the Asian Studies Center of the University of Tehran, Iran, said that President Xi Jinping profoundly pointed out the fundamental reasons why the situation between Palestine and Israel has developed to this day, &quot;demonstrating China&#39;s position and efforts to safeguard international fairness and justice, and helps promote The Palestinian issue will be resolved comprehensively, justly and lastingly at an early date.&quot; &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Shabani highly agreed with the important propositions put forward by President Xi Jinping and believed that China has always firmly supported the just cause of the Palestinian people to restore their legitimate national rights and has always stood with the Palestinian people.

This is the fundamental way to resolve the Palestinian issue. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>; &lt;strong>;“Committed to promoting peace, security, and stability in the region”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;President Xi Jinping pointed out that since the outbreak of the current round of Palestinian-Israeli conflict, China has actively promoted peace and stability. negotiate, promote a ceasefire and an end to the war, provide emergency humanitarian assistance to the Gaza Strip, and will continue to provide material assistance based on the needs of the Gaza people.

In particular, China, as the rotating president of the United Nations Security Council, presided over the adoption of Security Council Resolution 2712. Jabala said that China&#39;s position on the Palestinian-Israeli issue is highly recognized by the majority of Arab countries. A joint delegation of foreign ministers from Arab and Islamic countries recently visited China. They expressed their gratitude to China for its leadership in promoting the adoption of important resolutions by the United Nations General Assembly and the Security Council, and hoped to work with China to promote an immediate ceasefire, increase humanitarian assistance, and effectively implement the &quot;two-state solution.&quot; . &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Tan Zheli said that China plays an active role in promoting peace talks and promoting the resolution of international and regional hot issues.

In-depth dialogue will make it difficult to achieve long-term progress. This must become an indispensable part of the entire process.&quot; The San Francisco meeting between the heads of state of China and the United States achieved many results, including the establishment of an intergovernmental dialogue on artificial intelligence, which encouraged the international science and technology community as soon as it was announced. . This shows that the two heads of state agree to promote and strengthen dialogue and cooperation between China and the United States in various fields, which is in line with the common expectations of the two peoples and the international community, helps to establish a stronger bond of interests for Sino-US relations, and increases the international community’s support for the stability of Sino-US relations. The confidence to come down and get better. &lt;/P>;&lt;P>;President Xi Jinping pointed out at the meeting in San Francisco that China and the United States have broad common interests in many fields, including traditional fields such as economy, trade, and agriculture, as well as emerging fields such as climate change and artificial intelligence. Under the current situation, the common interests between the two countries have not decreased, but have increased. This sets the tone for China and the United States to jointly promote mutually beneficial cooperation. The important consensus and results achieved at the meeting once again prove that mutual benefit and win-win are the essential characteristics of Sino-US relations, and dialogue and cooperation are the only correct choice for the two countries. &lt;/P>;&lt;P>;The Sino-US relationship is the most important bilateral relationship in the world, and it is also a very complex bilateral relationship. To accurately grasp the relationship between these two major countries, we must not only see the phenomena and details, but also grasp the essence and overall situation, and avoid generalizing and neglecting the fundamentals. In recent years, some people in the United States have fallen into misunderstandings on how to define Sino-US relations. They always mention competition, as if competition has become the biggest theme or even the entire issue in Sino-US relations. This view not only deviates from the basic reality of Sino-US relations, but also risks pushing both sides into conflict and confrontation. It is normal for China and the United States to compete in some areas, but from an overall and overall perspective, it is not difficult to see that competition is only a tributary, and common interests are the mainstream. No conflict, no confrontation, and peaceful coexistence between China and the United States are the most basic common interests of the two countries. The economies of China and the United States are deeply integrated and face new development tasks. They need to benefit from each other&#39;s development, which is also a common interest. Post-epidemic recovery of the global economy, response to climate change, and resolution of regional hotspot issues are also inseparable from coordination and cooperation between China and the United States, which are of common interest. &lt;/P>;&lt;P>;Promoting mutually beneficial cooperation requires necessary conditions and atmosphere. Cooperation should be a two-way street and cannot and should not be a one-way street. Both sides should respect each other, be reciprocal and benefit each other, focus on the overall situation, and provide a good atmosphere for bilateral cooperation. Some people in the United States want to demand unconditional cooperation from China in areas where China is in need, while continuing to contain and suppress China, undermining China&#39;s legitimate rights and interests. This logic cannot be established and cannot be accepted by China. China advocates win-win cooperation between China and the United States, but China has interests that must be safeguarded, principles that must be defended, and bottom lines that must be adhered to. Only by adhering to mutual respect, equality and mutual benefit can dialogue and cooperation be stable and long-term and truly benefit the two peoples. &lt;/P>;&lt;P>;Promoting mutually beneficial cooperation is inseparable from necessary channels and mechanisms. President Xi Jinping pointed out that the two sides should make full use of the mechanisms restored or established in the fields of diplomacy, economy, finance, commerce, agriculture and other fields to carry out cooperation in areas such as drug control, judicial law enforcement, artificial intelligence, science and technology. This fully demonstrates China&#39;s sincere desire and responsible stance to promote mutually beneficial cooperation between China and the United States and promote the improvement of Sino-US relations. In recent years, due to well-known reasons, China-US relations have encountered serious difficulties, and some dialogue and cooperation channels established by the two sides over decades have been interrupted. This is not in the fundamental interests of the two countries and is not in line with the true wishes of the two peoples. The San Francisco meeting between the heads of state of China and the United States reached important consensus on promoting dialogue and cooperation. The two sides decided to strengthen high-level exchanges and promote institutional consultations in various fields such as commerce, economy, finance, export control, Asia-Pacific affairs, maritime, arms control and non-proliferation, foreign policy planning, joint working groups, and persons with disabilities. The two sides agreed to initiate negotiations on renewing the China-US Science and Technology Cooperation Agreement and restart the China-US Joint Committee on Agriculture. Both sides should make good use of these channels and mechanisms to enable them to effectively play their role in promoting mutually beneficial cooperation. &lt;/P>;&lt;P>;History and reality have repeatedly shown that as long as China and the United States promote mutually beneficial cooperation, they will be able to create opportunities for both sides to better cope with their respective challenges and achieve development. China and the United States have developed bilateral trade of US$760 billion and accumulated two-way investment of more than US$260 billion, which has brought growth momentum and people&#39;s livelihood and welfare to both sides. American companies have the largest exhibition area at the CIIE for six consecutive years. This year, more than 200 American companies participated in the exhibition. This fully shows that the American business community sees opportunities in China and hopes to continue mutually beneficial cooperation with China. China is committed to high-quality development, and the United States is also working to revitalize the economy. There is unlimited space for cooperation between the two sides, and they can achieve mutual success and win-win results. With a view to better coping with common challenges and promoting the interests of the two peoples, China and the United States should extend the list of cooperation and make the cake of cooperation bigger, so that Sino-US cooperation is a &quot;must-have&quot; more deeply rooted in the hearts of the people. &lt;/P>;&lt;P>;Win-win cooperation is the trend of the times and the foundation of China-US relations. China and the United States should seize the opportunity, meet each other halfway, jointly promote mutually beneficial cooperation, and jointly consolidate the positive momentum of bilateral relations. &lt;/P>;&lt;!--/enpcontent-->; &lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https:// feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 23 Nov 2023 05:56:05 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[02版要闻 - 王毅同新加坡外长维文通电话]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://paper.people.com.cn/rmrb/html/2023-11/23/nw.D110000renmrb_20231123_3-02.htm]]><description> &lt;div>;Thursday, November 23, 2023&lt;/div>; &lt;!--enpcontent-->;&lt;P>;Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, November 22&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;On November 22, Member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Minister of Foreign Affairs Wang Yi had a phone call with Singaporean Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan as requested. &lt;/P>;&lt;P>;Victoria Vivian said that New Zealand and China have close relations and in-depth cooperation.
