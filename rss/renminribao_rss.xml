Five years since the Yangtze River Delta integrated development strategy was proposed and implemented, the &quot;Yangtze River Delta Regional Integrated Development Plan Outline&quot; was issued. The &quot;four beams and eight pillars&quot; of the Yangtze River Delta integrated development have been continuously improved.
