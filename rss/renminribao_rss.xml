Strengthen, optimize the industrial layout, improve the interest linkage mechanism, and allow farmers to share more of the value-added benefits of the industry. &lt;/P>;&lt;P>;The cadres and masses of Yunnan have thoroughly implemented the spirit of General Secretary Xi Jinping’s important instructions, based on the basis of diverse resources, continuously transformed resource advantages into economic advantages, and developed and expanded plateau characteristic agriculture. &lt;/P>;&lt;P>;On the mountain, coffee trees are spread out in layers; in the village, the aroma of coffee beans is overflowing. Xinzhai Village, Lujiang Town, Longyang District, Baoshan City, with an average altitude of nearly 1,000 meters, is adjacent to Gaoligong Mountain to the west and Nujiang Grand Canyon to the east. Industrial cultivation of coffee beans was launched earlier in the country. &quot;Eleven coffee companies have settled in the village, with an annual output value of hundreds of millions of yuan.&quot; Yang Long, secretary of the Lujiang Town Party Committee, said. &lt;/P>;&lt;P>;In Yunnan, more and more villages are famous for developing plateau characteristic agriculture. Located on a low-latitude plateau, with distinctive vertical climate characteristics, abundant light, heat, and biological resources, Yunnan has become one of the regions with the richest agricultural resources in the northern hemisphere, and also provides fertile ground for the development of plateau-specific agriculture. &quot;Rich varieties, high quality, and year-round production are a major feature of Yunnan&#39;s agriculture.&quot; said Lai Yiyong, deputy director of the Yunnan Provincial Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs. &quot;Vegetables are available all year round, with a balanced supply of more than 20 million tons to other provinces every year.&quot; &lt;/P>;&lt;P>;Making good use of its resource endowments, Yunnan will increase policy support and promote the development of the entire industry chain of plateau characteristic agriculture. Starting from 2022, Yunnan will implement a three-year action for agricultural modernization, establish a special team, equip expert groups, and vigorously support plateau specialty agricultural products such as tea, flowers, and vegetables. Establish a catalog of agricultural products with plateau characteristics, and arrange special support funds from the provincial finance department to guide financial institutions to launch targeted credit products to help develop plateau agriculture. In 2022, the scale of agricultural investment in Yunnan Province will rank among the top in the country. &lt;/P>;&lt;P>;In Luoping County, Qujing City, yellow ginger has a cultivation history of more than 300 years, with a total output value of more than 1 billion yuan in 2022. &quot;The party committee and the government have provided strong policy support in terms of credit support and market cultivation, and the development prospects are exciting.&quot; said Zhang Wankun, deputy director of the Luoping County Ginger Technology Promotion Station. &lt;/P>;&lt;P>;In response to the needs of industrial development, Yunnan has strengthened agricultural technology and equipment support and continued to improve the quality and efficiency of plateau characteristic agriculture. Organize and implement key technology integration demonstration projects for rural revitalization industries. Since 2022, the province has transformed and applied 51 scientific and technological achievements, established 113 production demonstration bases, trained 31,000 agricultural scientific and technological personnel, and developed a number of county characteristics such as Nujiang Caoguo and Lijiang Mango. The industry has achieved quality improvement and upgrading. &lt;/P>;&lt;P>;Walking into the digital blueberry industry base in Yongren County, Chuxiong Yi Autonomous Prefecture, waist-high blueberries thrive in the soil. Taking a closer look, you can see four white &quot;drip arrows&quot; inserted in the matrix soil, which are used for irrigation and liquid inflow and drainage monitoring. &quot;The automated pulse drip irrigation system we use saves nearly 50% of water and fertilizer compared to traditional drip irrigation.&quot; Xu Kun, the person in charge of the industrial base, said that blueberries are on the market at staggered times from November to May of the following year, and the income per mu exceeds 100,000 yuan. &lt;/P>;&lt;P>;The characteristic agriculture of the Yunnan Plateau has delivered a dazzling report card: in 2022, the scale and output of tea, flowers, nuts, coffee, Chinese medicinal materials, natural rubber, and wild edible fungi will rank among the top in the country, with tea, The output value of the entire industry chain in eight industries, including flowers and vegetables, exceeded 120 billion yuan. Relying on leading agricultural enterprises and farmers&#39; professional cooperatives, Yunnan has introduced incentives and subsidies for entities that work with farmers to guide farmers, summarizing and promoting 16 mechanisms. Nearly 30,000 new agricultural business entities in the province have formed a close interest link with about 1.63 million households that have been lifted out of poverty. &lt;/P>;&lt;P>;“Yunnan has many high-quality specialty agricultural products. It is necessary to turn good resources into good commodities and drive more farmers to increase their income and become rich locally and nearby.” Wang Ning, Secretary of the Yunnan Provincial Party Committee, said. &lt;/P>;&lt;!--/enpcontent-->;</description><pubDate> Sun, 26 Nov 2023 05:56:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[01版要闻 - 四川奋力开创高质量发展新局面（高质量发展调研行）]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://paper.people.com.cn/rmrb/html/2023-11/26/nw.D110000renmrb_20231126_2-01.htm]]><description> &lt;div>;Sunday, November 26, 2023&lt;/div>; &lt;!--enpcontent-->;&lt;p>;The 2,500 Geely Star buses that provide connection services for the Hangzhou Asian Games are produced in Nanchong, Sichuan; in Deyang, Sichuan, Dongfang The G50 heavy-duty gas turbine developed by Steam Turbine Co., Ltd. fills the domestic technology gap... Across Sichuan, high-quality development momentum is surging. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;In July this year, General Secretary Xi Jinping emphasized during his inspection in Sichuan that Sichuan should further grasp its strategic position and strategic mission from the overall national situation, base on local reality, clarify development ideas and main directions, and forge long boards and Make up for the shortcomings, strive to achieve new breakthroughs in improving scientific and technological innovation capabilities, building a modern industrial system, promoting rural revitalization, and strengthening ecological and environmental governance, promote the governance of Sichuan in the new era to a new level, and strive to write a new chapter in Chinese-style modernization of Sichuan . &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The cadres and masses of Sichuan have kept in mind General Secretary Xi Jinping’s earnest instructions, completely, accurately and comprehensively implemented the new development concept, served and integrated into the new development pattern, and strived to create a new situation of high-quality development. In the first three quarters of this year, Sichuan Province&#39;s GDP grew by 6.5% year-on-year. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Accelerate the construction of a modern industrial system&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The power semiconductor ceramic substrate project is put into production, promoting the development of Neijiang City&#39;s electronic information industry to the mid-to-high end; Epno&#39;s annual output is 30 The 10,000-ton silicon carbon anode material project has been settled, filling the gap in the battery anode material industry in Neijiang... The growing Neijiang Economic and Technological Development Zone has continued to grow in new momentum for development. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“We promote the transformation and upgrading of traditional industries while cultivating emerging industries.” Neijiang Mayor Li Dan said that in the process of promoting high-quality development, Neijiang proposed an “industrial doubling” plan, which not only highlights the development of “vanadium &quot;Titanium +&quot; and other traditional industries, and vigorously develop emerging industries such as biomedicine. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;In June this year, the Sichuan Provincial Party Committee Plenary Session made a decision to further promote new industrialization and accelerate the construction of a modern industrial system, focusing on cultivating new momentum, shaping new advantages, and actively seizing the initiative for future development. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Hu Yuqing, deputy director of the Sichuan Provincial Development and Reform Commission, introduced that Sichuan has focused on the six major advantageous industries of electronic information, equipment manufacturing, food and textiles, energy and chemicals, advanced materials, and medicine and health to implement quality improvement and multiplication actions, focusing on traditional Industrial transformation and upgrading, vigorously promote process change, structural optimization, energy level improvement, method transformation, and strive to rejuvenate the old foundation; focus on cultivating and growing emerging industries, and actively invest in artificial intelligence, biotechnology, satellite networks, new energy and intelligent networks New tracks such as connected cars and drones. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Open up new tracks and deploy new materials to make Zigong, an old industrial city, &quot;old trees sprout new shoots.&quot; In the Zigong Aviation Industrial Park, large drones that can be used in industry, meteorology and other fields soared into the sky. Zigong is actively developing the drone and general aviation industry. 53 major projects including the R&amp;D and manufacturing of complete drones and parts have been launched one after another. The industry has accelerated its agglomeration and has become an important gathering area for the development of Sichuan&#39;s general aviation industry. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;At the same time, Zigong takes advantage of its abundant brine and natural gas resources to build a 100-billion-yuan new industry based on salt chemicals, fluorosilicone materials as the main line, and new energy materials and fine chemicals as the two wings. Materials industry cluster. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Taking the development of advanced manufacturing as a key focus, various regions in Sichuan have vigorously promoted industrial optimization and upgrading and laid out new fields and new tracks. Today, Chengdu New Display, Yibin Power Batteries, Leshan Crystalline Silicon Photovoltaics, Deyang Clean Energy Equipment, Ya&#39;an Big Data Industry, etc. have become the new business cards of Sichuan industries. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Focus on improving technological innovation capabilities&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;In March this year, the country’s first independently developed F-class 50-megawatt heavy-duty gas turbine (code-named G50) generator set was launched. After undergoing a &quot;72+24&quot; trial operation in Qingyuan City, Guangdong Province, it was officially put into commercial operation. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“The G50 has achieved a breakthrough in heavy-duty gas turbines from ‘0’ to ‘1’.” Li Xin, a researcher at the Heavy-duty Gas Turbine Equipment Research Institute of Dongfang Steam Turbine Co., Ltd. said that during the development process of the G50, the company obtained Authorized 136 invention patents, participated in the formulation of 6 national/industry standards, formed more than 1,000 gas turbine design/manufacturing standards, independently trained a gas turbine design team of more than 120 people, and fully mastered the entire process of independent design, manufacturing, and testing of heavy-duty gas turbines Ability. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Sichuan vigorously implements the innovation-driven development strategy, actively connects with national strategic scientific and technological forces and resources, optimizes and improves the layout of innovation resources, and has 196 national-level scientific and technological innovation platforms, ranking among the top among western provinces. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;In Mianyang City, the &quot;China Science and Technology City&quot;, we will accelerate the opening of channels for the transformation and industrialization of scientific and technological innovation achievements, and transform the advantages of scientific and technological innovation into high-quality development advantages.

Mao Shuang, a second-level inspector of the Sichuan Provincial Department of Ecology and Environment, said that Sichuan has made in-depth efforts to prevent and control pollution, and the quality of the ecological environment has been greatly improved - the excellent and good rate of water quality in national examination sections has increased from 72.4% in 2016 to 99.5% in 2022, a record high The best level in 20 years; the rate of days with good air quality has increased from 85.2% in 2015 to 89.3% in 2022, the number of days with heavy pollution has decreased by 78% compared with 5 years ago, and the urban and rural living environment has been significantly improved. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Take &quot;green&quot; as the base and move towards &quot;green&quot;. Sichuan accelerates the green transformation of its development model and enhances the green momentum for high-quality development. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;As a major clean energy province, Sichuan ranks among the top in the country in natural gas (shale gas) production and lithium resource reserves, with clean energy installed capacity accounting for 85.8%. Taking advantage of its green energy base, Sichuan vigorously promotes the development of green and low-carbon advantageous industries such as clean energy, power batteries, crystalline silicon photovoltaics, vanadium and titanium, and energy storage. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;In Yibin City, from upstream basic raw materials to major components, to new energy vehicles and battery recycling, a &quot;1+N&quot; green closed-loop entire industry chain ecosystem for power batteries has been formed. From January to September this year, Yibin&#39;s power battery industry achieved an output value of 70.6 billion yuan, a year-on-year increase of 23.33%. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;In the Photovoltaic Industrial Park of Wutongqiao Economic Development Zone in Leshan City, the company&#39;s production workshops are operating at full capacity, and the construction of the park is in full swing. Leshan City vigorously develops the crystalline silicon photovoltaic industry and promotes industrial chain extension, reinforcement and strengthening.

General Secretary Xi Jinping emphasized: &quot;Strengthening the construction of marine ecological civilization is an important part of the construction of ecological civilization. We must adhere to green development, work one generation after another, work hard for a long time, build a beautiful China, and make China&#39;s contribution to protecting the global village.&quot;&lt;/ p>;&lt;p>;China has achieved remarkable results in the construction of marine ecological civilization in the new era, and many touching stories and advanced experiences have emerged. In the recently announced selection of the 2023 United Nations &quot;Champions of the Earth Award&quot;, the new model of marine plastic waste management &quot;Blue Cycle&quot; jointly applied by the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Ecology and Environment and Zhejiang Lanjing Technology Co., Ltd. was selected from 2,500 applied projects around the world. stood out and won the United Nations’ highest honor in the field of environmental protection. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“Around the world, efforts are being made to find innovative ways to tackle plastic pollution and improve the planet. ‘Champions of the Earth’ are leading the charge. They bring hope and remind us of solutions to plastic pollution. Protecting nature is the key to achieving sustainable development,&quot; said the relevant person in charge of the United Nations Environment Program. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The &quot;Blue Cycle&quot; model has been explored in Zhejiang since 2020. Through &quot;government guidance + market operation&quot;, it has attracted coastal people to participate in the collection of marine plastic waste, united plastic application companies, and established &quot;Blue The &quot;Alliance Shared Wealth Fund&quot; conducts secondary value distribution to achieve a &quot;win-win&quot; between ecological protection and increasing income and enriching the people. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&quot;Currently, more than 6,300 people and fishermen, 10,180 ships and more than 230 companies in Zhejiang Province have participated in the &#39;Blue Cycle&#39; model, collecting a total of approximately 10,936 tons of marine waste, including plastic About 2,254 tons of waste were removed, and carbon emissions were reduced by about 2,930 tons, effectively improving the offshore environment.&quot; said Lang Wenrong, director of the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Ecology and Environment. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Using innovative green actions to prevent and control &quot;white pollution&quot; and protect the blue ocean, the new model of &quot;blue cycle&quot; is a new modern practice in the new era that strives to build a harmonious coexistence between man and nature. How does this new model work? What difficulties in plastic pollution control have been solved and what initial results have been achieved? How to summarize the experience and gradually promote it in the next step? &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;How to collect it from the ocean to the shore? &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Fishermen brought marine plastic waste and domestic garbage back to the port for centralized processing, and people became more motivated to pick up plastic waste on the beach. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&quot;Start The net is closed!&quot;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;In the waters of Wenling City, Zhejiang Province, East China Sea, the wheels on the fishing boat &quot;Zheling Yuxiu 00003&quot; rattled, and the fishing net was slowly put away, Xiaoshatou Village, Shitang Town, Wenling City Fisherman Guo Wenbiao and his companions quickly sorted eels, rays, crabs, etc. fished from the seabed. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The fishing nets are also mixed with some disposable plastic lunch boxes, plastic bags, discarded fishing nets and other waste. &quot;These wastes cannot be thrown back into the sea. They must be brought ashore for centralized processing.&quot; Guo Wenbiao, who has been fishing at sea all his life and has a tanned skin, said, &quot;There is much less plastic waste in the sea now than before, and the marine ecological environment is continuing to improve.&quot; Improve.&quot; &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;In Xiaoshatou Village, there is a &quot;Little Blue House&quot;. &quot;Little Blue House&quot; is a collection and storage site for marine plastic waste in the &quot;Blue Cycle&quot; model. It is mainly responsible for the unified recycling, classification and packaging of marine plastic waste. Guo Wenbiao and more than 50 fishermen and coastal people formed a collection team to recover waste through estuary interception, beach picking, fishing net salvage and other methods, and then sold it to Lanjing Technology, a national high-tech enterprise focusing on sustainable development of the ocean. &quot;The coast and ocean are cleaner, it is safer to go to sea, and people can still make money!&quot; Guo Wenbiao beamed. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“Nowadays, fishermen’s enthusiasm and initiative to participate in ecological and environmental protection have been greatly enhanced.” Guo Wenbiao said, “Fishermen who return home with a full load not only send fresh catches to the market, but also often put away plastic boxes and plastic bottles. , plastic bags and other plastic waste are sent to the &#39;Little Blue House&#39;, including production and domestic waste generated on the ship, as well as marine debris picked up during operations.&quot;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;It is important to control global marine plastic pollution. Marine ecological environment protection is a worldwide problem. A report released by the United Nations Environment Program shows that plastic products are the largest, most harmful and most persistent part of marine debris, accounting for at least 85% of total marine debris. The United Nations lists the prevention and significant reduction of marine debris as an indicator of sustainable development. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Zhejiang’s sea area is 260,000 square kilometers and there are 4,350 islands. The task of strengthening marine ecological environment protection and controlling marine plastic pollution is heavy and stressful. Lang Wenrong said: &quot;In order to effectively solve the difficult pain points of marine plastic waste collection, high-value utilization, and long-term management, Zhejiang Province has constructed a governance system of &#39;market-based waste collection-international certification value-added-high-value resource utilization&#39; system, creating a new model of &#39;blue cycle&#39; marine plastic waste management that is intrinsically driven, sustainable and replicable.&quot;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&quot;The &#39;blue cycle&#39; model uses blockchain and the Internet of Things and other technologies to ensure the visual traceability of all aspects of marine plastic waste collection, regeneration, remanufacturing, and resale, thereby laying the foundation for the international certification of marine plastics, value-added, and high-value resource utilization.&quot; Xie Huan, Director of the Taizhou Municipal Ecological Environment Bureau Said, &quot;The &#39;blue cycle&#39; model achieves high premiums and high profits for plastic waste recycling, and increases the enthusiasm of the masses for participation, which is the key to the sustainable operation of this model.&quot;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Afternoon At midnight, in the Golden Beach Park of Shitang Peninsula in Wenling City, Li Qiming, wearing a blue vest with the words &quot;Blue Cycle&quot;, held long-handled garbage tongs in one hand and a woven bag in the other to pick up the plastic bottles scattered on the beach. , put it in the bag. He also wore a recorder on his chest for uploading live video. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;In the past two years, the &quot;blue cycle&quot; model has driven up the price of marine plastics. 54-year-old Li Qiming often goes to the beach to pick up plastic bottles while working in an aquatic products processing factory. Li Qiming made some calculations: &quot;Nowadays, a plastic bottle can be sold for almost 20 cents. When there are many tourists in summer, we can pick up hundreds of bottles a day, and we can earn one to two thousand yuan in a month.&quot; It can not only increase income, but also make some calculations. It can also reduce marine plastic waste. Li Qiming has tasted the benefits of participating in the &quot;blue cycle&quot; model and is full of motivation. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;In Huangjiao Island, Luqiao District, Taizhou City, 74-year-old fisherman Chen Xiafang has also gained an extra income recently. &quot;I use my free time every day to pick up plastic waste on the coastline and deliver it to the &#39;Little Blue Home&#39;, which can increase my income by about 700 yuan a month.&quot; Chen Xiafang said. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;How to turn waste products into resources? &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;15 &quot;Little Blue Houses&quot; have been built to collect, weigh, sort and transfer marine plastic waste&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>; No. 477 Shangruo Road, Sixin Community, Shitang Town, Wenling City, Ruoshan &quot;Little Blue House&quot;, a room of more than 30 square meters is filled with large bags of various types of discarded plastic bottles. Two sorters are skillfully sorting, compressing, packaging and weighing plastic bottles. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“This job at home can not only increase income, but is also a very meaningful thing.” Lin Yunqin, a 58-year-old sorter, said. She is a villager in Cang&#39;ao Village, mainly engaged in fish wholesale, and started working part-time at &quot;Xiaolan&#39;s Home&quot; last year. After she and her colleagues classified the plastic bottles into four categories, they put them into a compression machine and compressed them into &quot;plastic bottle bricks&quot; each weighing more than 30 kilograms. These &quot;plastic bottle bricks&quot; are then transported to modern factories for processing and turned into plastic pellets. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;In the evening, Li Qiming transported the two large bags of plastic bottles he picked up to Ruoshan&#39;s &quot;Xiaolan&#39;s Home&quot;. Zhang Wenxiang, the person in charge of &quot;Little Blue House&quot;, weighed the plastic bottle on the scale, registered it on the &quot;Blue Cycle&quot; mobile app, and generated a traceable QR code. After completing a series of operations according to the process, Zhang Wenxiang paid the acquisition fee at a price higher than that of ordinary discarded plastic bottles. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;To achieve such a high premium, the video recorders worn by Li Qiming and other front-line plastic waste collectors play an important role. &quot;It is precisely because of traceable evidence such as videos that the plastic particles produced by the &#39;Blue Cycle&#39; model can be certified as &#39;marine plastics&#39; by international certification organizations and generate high premiums,&quot; said Liu Jia&#39;an, an operation and maintenance staff at Lanjing Technology. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;At present, 15 &quot;Little Blue Home&quot; marine plastic waste collection and storage sites have been established in Taizhou, Ningbo, and Zhoushan cities in Zhejiang Province, including 11 in Taizhou. Through the &quot;Little Blue House&quot; pre-processing of marine plastic waste, its volume is reduced by 70%, significantly reducing subsequent transportation and disposal costs. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&quot;Taizhou has explored and established a series of systems and formulated a special work plan, which combines &#39;restraint&#39; and &#39;incentive&#39; to ensure the sustainable operation of the &#39;blue cycle&#39; model.&quot; Xie Huan introduced that Taizhou focuses on A credit evaluation service system is built based on the historical trustworthiness records, daily management, garbage collection operation management, environmental protection training records, etc. of frontline collectors. Personnel who continue to collect marine plastic waste and whose credit evaluation is &quot;excellent&quot; can obtain the value-added benefits of the industrial chain. Distribution and social insurance services. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The establishment and development of the &quot;Blue Cycle&quot; model is inseparable from the deep foundation of Zhejiang Digital Technology. Advanced digital technology allows ocean plastics to be traced visually throughout the entire process, making the entire process clearly visible. In order to prevent plastic waste that is not ocean plastic from being mixed into the &quot;blue cycle&quot;, Blueview Technology has equipped front-line collectors with tools such as video recorders to record the source of plastic waste and other information; in addition, it has also set up wastewater treatment plants near the coastline. The &quot;electronic fence&quot; ensures that plastic waste originates within 3 kilometers of the coastline. Beyond this area, it will not be recognized as marine plastic waste. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;How to change from resources to products? &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Marine plastic waste goes through three processes and becomes recycled marine plastic particles, which are used to produce textiles, packaging, auto parts, etc.&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt; p>;Only when marine plastic waste is turned into high-quality recycled marine plastic particles can high-value utilization be achieved. What steps are needed to do this? &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The reporter visited Veolia Huafei Polymer Technology (Zhejiang) Co., Ltd., located in Anji County, Huzhou City, Zhejiang Province, and visited the entire process of rebirth of marine plastic collected under the &quot;Blue Cycle&quot; model. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“The first step for ‘plastic bottle bricks’ when they come here is to clean them.” The reporter followed Song Ping, general manager of Veolia Huafei, to the cleaning line of the plastic recycling plant. &quot;After the &#39;plastic bottle bricks&#39; are unpacked here, they are put into the machine to clean the entire bottle to remove oil stains, sludge, dust and other impurities on the bottle.&quot;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;There are many kinds of plastic bottles. Diverse, with great differences in color, material, etc. &quot;If you adopt a &#39;big pot&#39; processing method, it will easily lead to uneven quality of recycled products. Therefore, the cleaned plastic bottles must also go through automatic optical sorting equipment and manual sorting to eliminate inappropriate colors and materials. Miscellaneous bottles for subsequent processing.&quot; Song Ping introduced that after bottles with uniform material, color, and quality are broken, high-quality cold-washed bottle flakes are obtained. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The second stop for waste plastic bottles at Veolia Huafei is the hot washing and sorting production line. Here, the bottle flakes are cleaned at high temperatures to further remove impurities, and optical sorting equipment will also perform finer sorting. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“Unlike waste plastics on land, marine waste plastics may have a yellowish color, partial degradation, and reduced physical properties due to the impact of seawater immersion. Therefore, it is necessary to rely on high-quality cleaning processes to remove High salt content on the surface and inside of bottle pieces.&quot; Song Ping said. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Precise cleaning is achieved with targeted chemical ratio, high-temperature stirring and cooking to remove sea salt, fructose, glue, etc., high-speed friction machine to remove attachments, continuous 4-channel shallow water rinsing tank to rinse residual impurities...each process is strict process, laying a good foundation for subsequent high value-added utilization. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“At this point, the original dirty ocean waste plastic bottles have been turned into bottle flakes with a purity of nearly 100%. However, strict quality inspection is still required to ensure that the impurity content is less than the control value. Only then can we enter the next process.&quot; Song Ping said. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The pipes are intertwined, the machines are roaring, and the granulating equipment is continuously &quot;spitting&quot; out plastic particles. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“This is the third process - the bottle pieces that meet the requirements are sent to the extruder for melting, and after two-stage filtration, they are cut into uniformly sized recycled plastic particles.” Song Ping said, and finally leave the factory. Before, the laboratory will also test and inspect the particles. Only products that meet legal and regulatory requirements and meet technical characteristics can be sold externally. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Leaving the factory area and coming to the smart warehouse, on the conveyor, bags of recycled plastic particles were moving up and down, ready to go. This is the last stop for marine waste plastic bottles at Veolia Huafei. After the recycled plastic particles are purchased by downstream manufacturers, they are further processed and widely used in the production of textiles, packaging, auto parts, digital products, etc. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The ocean plastic collected through the &quot;Blue Cycle&quot; model has a new life here. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“Ocean plastic waste has been turned into treasure and returned to our lives.” Fu Xianwei, Veolia Huafei Operations Director, said that so far, Veolia Huafei has processed plastic waste from “blue The number of discarded ocean plastic bottles in the &quot;color recycling&quot; model has reached about 10 million. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&quot;The raw materials for manufacturing plastics mainly come from fossil fuels. The carbon emissions produced by producing 1 ton of recycled ocean plastic particles are more than 1 ton less than the production of 1 ton of virgin plastic particles. Therefore, some companies that value the environment, society and Chinese and foreign companies that focus on ESG governance prefer marine plastic particles to meet their carbon emission reduction needs,&quot; said Fu Xianwei. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;How to protect the ecology while increasing income and enriching the people? &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Internationally certified marine plastic particles have greater room for appreciation than traditional recycled plastics&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;In recent years, many manufacturing companies have actively Fulfill the social responsibility of protecting the marine ecological environment and be willing to purchase some more expensive recycled marine plastic particles to replace virgin plastic particles. But one of the key difficulties is how to solve the problems of difficult traceability of ocean plastics and difficulty in certification of material recycling? &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;To this end, the &quot;Blue Cycle&quot; model has developed a visual traceability system based on blockchain and Internet of Things technology. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Walking into the Marine Waste System Command and Operation and Maintenance Center located in Jiaojiang District, Taizhou City, the reporter saw that the mobile phone cases, shampoo bottles, storage boxes and other marine plastic recycled products displayed here were all printed with There is an exclusive QR code. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“For example, in this notebook, the QR code is in the lower right corner of the casing.” Fang Min, Operations and Maintenance Director of Blueview Technology, introduced. The reporter took out his mobile phone and scanned the QR code, and the results showed that this notebook contains 12.13 grams of ocean plastic and can reduce 15.78 grams of carbon emissions. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“If you want to understand the entire process from plastic bottle to laptop shell, you can click on ‘visual traceability’.” Fang Min said. The reporter clicked on &quot;Visual Traceability&quot; and saw detailed records of all aspects of the collection, storage, transfer, regeneration, and manufacturing of marine plastic waste - plastic bottles were picked up on Waisha Road, Haimen Street, Jiaojiang District, and were collected, stored, and transported by trucks It is then transported to a technology company in Zhejiang Province to make recycled ocean plastic particles, and then transported to a company in Guangdong Province to be made into notebooks. Each link not only contains text information such as the name of the relevant personnel, processing location and time, but also includes on-site pictures, videos and blockchain electronic orders. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&quot;The &#39;Blue Cycle&#39; model relies on technologies such as blockchain and the Internet of Things to achieve full visual traceability of the entire life cycle of plastic waste from the ocean to the shelf, and conduct carbon labeling and carbon footprint calibration. , and has been certified by an international authoritative certification body, effectively promoting the transformation of marine plastic waste into treasure and increasing its value, which not only protects the marine ecological environment, but also realizes the recycling of marine plastic waste.&quot; Vice President of China Renewable Resources Recycling Association Chairman and Secretary-General Pan Yonggang said. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Fu Xianwei told reporters: &quot;Currently, the price of products produced from marine plastic waste as raw materials on the market is several times higher than similar products. Internationally certified marine plastic particles are more expensive than traditional recycled plastics.&quot; There is more room for appreciation.&quot;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&quot;Marine plastic particles produced under the &#39;Blue Cycle&#39; model have been sold for a maximum of 30,000 yuan per ton, which is more than three times the price of the same type of virgin plastic.&quot; This makes Fang Min and his colleagues feel very excited. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;High feedback is an important driving force for the sustainable development of the &quot;blue cycle&quot; model. Blueview Technology has joined forces with international environmental certification agencies and leading enterprises in the industry chain to form the &quot;Blue Alliance&quot; organization to extract 20% of the high-value utilization premium of marine plastics and establish a &quot;Blue Ecological Mutual Wealth Fund&quot; to pay for front-end waste Recycling personnel’s wages, accident insurance, critical illness medical insurance, etc. The average monthly income of front-line collectors is about 1,200 yuan. A total of 120 million yuan in green financial loans have been issued to fishermen. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&quot;The &#39;blue cycle&#39; model uses &#39;high returns&#39; to solve the problem of &#39;no one to collect&#39;, uses &#39;high credit&#39; to solve the problem of &#39;low value&#39;, and uses &#39;high feedback&#39; to solve The issue of &#39;sustainability&#39; has been solved.&quot; Lang Wenrong said that the &quot;blue cycle&quot; model of marine plastic waste management promotes the integrated development of marine digital governance, resource recycling, and common prosperity, and has been welcomed by coastal people and recognized by the international community. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&quot;In recent years, China has made significant progress in promoting the management of marine plastic waste. It has established and improved the &#39;marine sanitation&#39; system in various coastal areas and explored a number of good experiences and practices.&quot; Director of the National Marine Environment Monitoring Center Wang Juying said, &quot;Zhejiang&#39;s &#39;Blue Cycle&#39; model won the United Nations&#39; &#39;Champions of the Earth Award&#39;, which not only provides a demonstration case for China&#39;s marine plastic waste management, but also contributed Chinese solutions and solutions to the hot issue of global marine plastic waste management.&quot; Chinese wisdom.&quot;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Lang Wenrong said: &quot;In the next step, we will speed up the replication and promotion of the &#39;blue cycle&#39; model, deepen and improve the market participation mechanism, actively promote the high-quality development of the marine economy, and explore and create more Transform high-value governance models and cultivate new green growth points. At the same time, we strive to deepen and expand international cooperation, contribute Chinese solutions to world ocean governance, and jointly protect our blue homeland.&quot;&lt;/p>;&lt;!--/enpcontent-->;</description><pubDate> Sun, 26 Nov 2023 05:56:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[01版要闻 - 好生态带来好收益]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://paper.people.com.cn/rmrb/html/2023-11/26/nw.D110000renmrb_20231126_5-01.htm]]><description> &lt;div>;Sunday, November 26, 2023&lt;/div>; &lt;TABLE width=&quot;100%&quot;>;&lt;TBODY>;&lt;TR>;&lt;TD align=&quot;center&quot;>;&lt;IMG width=&quot;100%&quot; src=&quot;http: //paper.people.com.cn/rmrb/images/1/20231126/1700938947935_1.jpg&quot;>;&lt;/TD>;&lt;/TR>; &lt;TR>;&lt;TD>;&lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;/TD>;&lt;/ TR>;&lt;/TBODY>;&lt;/TABLE>; &lt;!--enpcontent-->;&lt;P>;Jiuzihe Town, Luotian County, Huanggang City, Hubei Province, has solidly promoted the construction of ecological civilization and promoted the integrated development of agriculture, culture and tourism.

In recent years, the sustainable and healthy development of the human resources service industry has provided important support for promoting high -quality and full employment, strengthening human resources development and utilization, and building a modern industrial system. &lt;/P>; &lt;p>; The industry scale continues to expand. my country&#39;s oversized market advantages and rich human resources endowments provide broad space and prospects for the development of the human resources service industry. As of the end of 2022, there were 63,000 human resource service agencies in my country, 1.042 million employees, and annual operating income exceeding 2.5 trillion yuan, which were 2.2 times, 3.1 times, and 4.4 times in 2012. Digital economy and other fields have given birth to a large number of human resources services, and the development of the industry&#39;s development has become increasingly apparent. The status of the human resources service industry as an important category of the productive service industry and the important part of the modern service industry continues to consolidate and continues to improve. &lt;/P>; &lt;p>; The role of stabilizing employment to promote development is increasing. In 2022, the industry held a total of 270,000 job fairs, hundreds of millions of post information on online recruitment, and tens of millions of workers. Based on serving the real economy as the focus, the industry provides personnel recruitment and management services for 52.68 million employers, of which about 40%are manufacturing enterprises. The human resources market has improved quality and efficiency, and has set up nearly 50,000 fixed recruitment venues and 21,000 human resources service websites. &lt;/P>; &lt;p>; The service level is significantly improved. Since 2010, my country has established 26 national human resources service industrial parks. In 2022, the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security and the Ministry of Commerce jointly identified the first batch of 12 human resources service export bases, becoming an innovative element gathering platform. At the same time, human resources service agencies have widely used emerging information technologies such as big data, artificial intelligence, and remote interviews, network training, and flexible employment.

Discussion. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Chinese studies have accumulated deep academic traditional paradigms, and they are full of vitality of the new era. The World Chinese Studies Conference, which started in Shanghai, is committed to providing a platform for the world&#39;s Chinese studies to talk and collide with ideas, create conditions for the international community to understand the historical Chinese and contemporary China, integrate Chinese and foreign civilization, and promote exchanges and mutual learning. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; Promoting Chinese studies under the global vision &lt;/strong>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;Chinese civilization and Chinese road under global vision&quot; is the World China Conference of China · Shanghai Forum. theme.

Scholars from all over the world have carried out research on Chinese studies, and many Chinese scholars and foreign scholars cooperate with research topics, which makes our understanding of China deeper. &quot;&lt;/P>; &lt;p>; as a gathering of Chinese studies in China, various types of China, various types of China The high -level academic exchange platform for learning talks, the World Chinese Studies Conference promotes the path dependence of Chinese studies in Chinese studies, and builds China&#39;s own discourse system. From the keywords of &quot;global vision&quot; in the conference theme, to the academic view of the four parallel sub -forums, the World Chinese Studies Conference actively showed the world&#39;s position, explained Chinese roads, and issued Chinese voices to the world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;African Chinese studies are continuously developing and becoming a part of the development of Chinese studies in the world. Ethiopia is an important force for Africa to study Chinese studies. More groups of learning Chinese have emerged, and more in -depth understanding And understand Chinese scholars. &quot;Former Ethiopian Prime Minister Haier Mariam Desarani said in a video of the conference. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Chinese studies are booming and cannot be separated from talent training; promoting globalization of China requires innovation of global talent training methods. Why should the deputy dean of Yanjing School of Peking University shared at the conference that the school&#39;s master&#39;s graduate program enrolled more than 100 young students each year and more than 80%of them came from overseas. They better understand China and form academic achievements. He said: &quot;Our students conducted Chinese studies in China, and directly contacted Chinese scholars and accepted guidance, which expanded the vision of research and thinking. I hope that the World Chinese Studies Conference will provide more exchange learning opportunities and support Chinese academic innovation and development. &quot;&lt;/P>; &lt;p>; 2023 China Student Contribution Award, Professor Bu Zhengmin, History Rongxiu, British University of British Columbia, Canada, said:&quot; History is not the history of a certain place and a country, but a global history.

He said that in a variety of languages ​​and many cultures, he studied Dunhuang writing and gave an important inspiration to the academic community -civilizations in various countries in the world have been inextricably linked since ancient times. In a single language and a single culture. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Civilization is colorful due to communication, and civilization is rich in mutual learning. From the speeches and conversations of the participating scholars, they can deeply feel their desire for civilized exchanges. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; At the parallel forum of &quot;Civilization Mutual Learning: Mutual Against the Chinese Nation in the Perspective&quot; parallel forum hosted by Fudan University during the World Chinese Studies Conference, scholars from various countries discussed the exchange and mutual learning of civilization from multiple perspectives. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Fan Yongpeng, deputy dean and researcher of the China Research Institute of Fudan University, said that traditional European sinology adopts a high -resolution perspective, which focuses on micro -and -in -depth research on China. American -style Chinese research is a low -resolution bird&#39;s eye view in the early days. &quot;The two traditions have their own strengths, but they are not enough. New Chinese learning must be a combination of the two. The ground zoom, focusing, and amplification, each specific research problem cannot leave China&#39;s specific practical experience. &quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; 2023 Bai Yongrui, a honorary professor at Yanshi University in South Korea, said: &quot;South Korea and China need to learn from each other and refer to each other.

The exchanges and mutual learning of other civilizations in the world are rich in development, giving Chinese -style modernization. The conference puts Chinese -style modernization in the process of the world, expands his horizons, and adds wisdom. Many experts believe that Chinese studies have provided wisdom and solutions to respond to the global crisis and solve the common challenges of human beings. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Chen Lai, the dean of the Chinese Academy of Chinese Studies and Senior Liberal Arts of Tsinghua University, believes that entering the new era and embarking on a new journey, China has established a new development pattern, promotes high -quality development, promotes the entire process of people&#39;s democracy, comprehensively in accordance with the law, comprehensively in accordance with the law. The governance of the country and the promotion of ecological civilization, cultural construction, etc. are shaping the Chinese -style modern institutional model, cultural model, and civilization connotation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The modernization roads of various countries are different, and the form of modern civilization is also colorful. Professor East Asia University and Culture Rongxiu of Gosteen University, Shi Hanwei, director and senior professor of Tubinen Center China Center, expressed similar views: &quot;In the past 40 years, China has deeply participated in the global cultural exchange dialogue and reached in terms of standards and values.
