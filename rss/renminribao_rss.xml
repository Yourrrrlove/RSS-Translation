The outbound water quality of Dongjiang Lake has maintained the national surface Class I water standard all year round and reached the national first-class drinking water standard, becoming the largest domestic drinking water source in Hunan Province. land. Relying on its ecological advantages, Zixing City built a food industrial park to make natural water, beverages and other products popular in the market. It also used the cold water resources of Dongjiang Lake to dissipate heat and cool down servers, attracting many companies to settle in the big data industrial park. &lt;/P>;&lt;P>;In the East Dongting Lake National Nature Reserve in Yueyang City, the wetland is shaded by reeds and finless porpoises leap in the water, which is full of vitality. Nowadays, when people stop at the patrol and monitoring station of the reserve, they can admire the beautiful coastline of the Yangtze River and savor the songs of migratory birds, the silhouettes of elk, and the smiles of finless porpoises. Over the past five years, Yueyang City has taken powerful measures such as cracking down on the &quot;chemical encirclement of the river&quot;, banning sand and gravel terminals, and reviving the shoreline ecology, so that the ecological environment here continues to improve, and the butterfly has become a national 4A-level scenic spot, Finless Porpoise Bay. &lt;/P>;&lt;P>;Starting from 2022, the integrated protection and restoration project of mountains, rivers, forests, fields, lakes, grass and sand in the Dongting Lake area will be launched to enhance biodiversity, control non-point source pollution, and restore the mine ecological environment... &quot;Guarding a clear river&quot; will Go deeper. &lt;/P>;&lt;P>;Faced with ecological debt, Hunan has deepened the joint management of the &quot;four water&quot; systems of the Yangtze River, Dongting Lake and Xiangzi Yuanli from the perspective of ecosystem integrity and river basin systems, and spared no effort to repair the ecological environment. &lt;/P>;&lt;P>;Since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, the Xiangjiang River Basin has launched a tough battle to prevent and control heavy metal pollution. Hunan has shut down and eliminated more than 1,200 heavy metal-related companies. From 2018 to 2022, the province will exit 3,249 enterprises with backward production capacity. &lt;/P>;&lt;P>;Efforts will be made to promote the conversion of old and new driving forces, and Hunan will accelerate the construction of an economic system with green, low-carbon and circular development. &lt;/P>;&lt;P>;Promote the transformation and upgrading of traditional advantageous industries and move towards high-end, intelligent and green industries. The Sinopec Changling Refining and Chemical Company on the bank of Dongting Lake is lined with green trees. &quot;Through transformation and upgrading of production technology, we have strengthened wastewater management and control, integrated all sewage into the pipe network, and prevented sewage from entering the Yangtze River.&quot; Chen Bin, deputy general manager of the company, said. &lt;/P>;&lt;P>;Promote emerging industries to shift gears and accelerate the development of new energy, new materials, power equipment and other industries. Ningxiang High-tech Zone has cultivated more than 20 regulated companies in energy storage materials. From battery cathode material precursors to waste battery recycling, a complete lithium battery energy storage industry chain has been formed. In the TBEA 5G Technology Industrial Park in Hengnan County, Hengyang City, a full range of distribution transformers and other products are sold well at home and abroad. The local area has taken advantage of the situation to introduce upstream and downstream enterprises, and the power equipment industry cluster is growing day by day. &lt;/P>;&lt;P>;As of the end of 2022, Hunan has cultivated a total of 136 national-level green factories, 13 green parks and 16 green supply chain management demonstration enterprises. In 2021 and 2022, the energy consumption per unit of industrial added value of enterprises above designated size in the province has continued to decline significantly. &lt;/P>;&lt;P>;Accelerating green development is inseparable from the &quot;baton&quot; of assessment. The newly revised &quot;Hunan Province&#39;s Assessment and Evaluation Methods for Promoting High-Quality Development of County Economy&quot; proposes to encourage differentiated development of counties and cities and to compete and catch up in different tracks. For example, for counties and cities that lead the integration of culture and tourism, especially counties with small populations, the focus will be on increasing people’s income, protecting the ecological environment, integrating culture, tourism and agriculture, etc. &lt;/P>;&lt;P>;As of the end of 2022, Hunan Province’s forest coverage rate reached 59.98%, the water quality rate of 147 national examination sections reached 98.6%, and it has 70 national wetland parks. Amidst the green mountains and green waters, Hunan has delivered a brilliant ecological answer sheet. &lt;/P>;&lt;!--/enpcontent-->;</description><pubDate> Sun, 05 Nov 2023 05:56:08 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[01版要闻 - 习近平就尼泊尔发生强烈地震向尼泊尔总统鲍德尔致慰问电]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://paper.people.com.cn/rmrb/html/2023-11/05/nw.D110000renmrb_20231105_2-01.htm]]><description> &lt;div>;Sunday, November 05, 2023&lt;/div>; &lt;!--enpcontent-->;&lt;P>;Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, November 4th&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;On November 4th, President Xi Jinping expressed concern about the severe earthquake in Nepal Sent a message of condolence to President Paudel of Nepal. &lt;/P>;&lt;P>;Xi Jinping said that he was shocked to learn that a strong earthquake occurred in Karnali Province in your country, causing heavy casualties and property losses.

Whether grassroots governance is good or not depends on the grassroots party organizations and the majority of party members and cadres. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, General Secretary Xi Jinping has made important instructions on many occasions, requiring that the &quot;Maple Bridge Experience&quot; in the new era be upheld and developed at the grassroots level of society. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The &quot;Maple Bridge Experience&quot; in the new era puts more emphasis on the party&#39;s leadership, more highlights the rule of law thinking, more prominent scientific and technological support, and more attention to social participation, showing its timeless charm and becoming our country&#39;s guide for promoting grassroots social governance. A &quot;golden sign&quot;. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Revitalize through persistence and carry forward through development. Since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, we have adhered to and developed the &quot;Maple Bridge Experience&quot; in the new era. Our country&#39;s social governance system of joint construction, joint governance and shared benefits has been further improved. The mechanism for correctly handling contradictions among the people under the new situation has been further improved. The majority of grassroots party members and cadres have promptly resolved conflicts. Disputes are resolved at the grassroots level and in the bud, the efficiency of social governance is further improved, and the people&#39;s sense of gain, happiness, and security continues to increase. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;This year marks the 60th anniversary of Comrade Mao Zedong’s instructions to study and promote the “Maple Bridge Experience” and the 20th anniversary of General Secretary Xi Jinping’s instructions to uphold and develop the “Maple Bridge Experience”. Rooted in the fertile soil of history and culture, forging ahead on a new journey, adhering to and developing the &quot;Maple Bridge Experience&quot; in the new era will surely further promote the modernization of my country&#39;s grassroots social governance system and governance capabilities, and will more effectively ensure that people live and work in peace and contentment, and that society is stable and secure. Preface, the country enjoys long-term peace and stability. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;More emphasis on the party’s leadership, and continuously transform the party’s political advantages, organizational advantages, and close contact with the masses into grassroots governance effectiveness&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;In “Maple Bridge In Fengqiao Town, Zhuji City, Zhejiang Province, the birthplace of &quot;Experience&quot;, there is an old party member who always likes to bring a small bench and sit among the neighbors, chatting about homely things, and has helped many people untie their &quot;knots&quot; in their hearts. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;His name is Yang Guangguang, a retired policeman from Fengqiao Police Station. After retirement, he has been committed to grassroots dispute mediation. He has recorded more than 100 &quot;mediation diaries&quot;. In the words of Yang Guangzhao, &quot;Mediation is about using the wisdom of the people to resolve the conflicts of the people. If everyone works together and handles the little things well, Fengqiao Town will be more harmonious and beautiful.&quot;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;60 In the past few years, the &quot;Maple Bridge Experience&quot; has already gone beyond Zhejiang and spread across the country, and has been continuously enriched and developed in practice. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Xianlin Street, Qixia District, Nanjing City, Jiangsu Province, was a place where petitions and complaints were frequent and conflicts occurred frequently. The subdistrict jurisdiction includes both high-end communities and demolished resettlement communities, well-known universities, and many &quot;five small industries&quot;. The subjects and objects are diverse, which brings considerable challenges to governance. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“Pick up the coat and collar, and lead the cow by the nose.” &quot;Open a network&quot; to weave a dense organizational system, &quot;front-line methods&quot; to promote cadres to sink, &quot;family members&quot; to gather regional resources, &quot;one heart&quot; to link up the party and the masses to jointly govern, and handle petitions as a &quot;mass work that comes to your door&quot; with heart and soul. Do it well and make the people feel at ease. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;If the foundation is not strong, the ground will shake. The grassroots level is the foundation of the party&#39;s governance and the source of strength. In 2021, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council issued the &quot;Opinions on Strengthening the Modernization of Grassroots Governance Systems and Governance Capabilities&quot;, making special arrangements for &quot;improving the system of comprehensive leadership of the Party at the grassroots level.&quot; &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;In recent years, various localities and departments have adhered to and developed the &quot;Maple Bridge Experience&quot; in the new era, and have always regarded strengthening grassroots party building and consolidating the party&#39;s ruling foundation as a red line that runs through social governance and grassroots construction. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Some places use the method of &quot;grid party building&quot; to continuously extend the reach of party organizations to every corner of the jurisdiction, so that &quot;things are done online, but difficult problems are solved online&quot;;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>; p>;&lt;p>;Some places use the method of &quot;regional party building&quot; to promote joint building and co-building between government agencies, enterprises and institutions and township (street) and village (community) party organizations to consolidate the ability to resolve conflicts and disputes on the spot in a timely manner;&lt; /p>;&lt;p>;Some places actively explore long-term mechanisms for the decentralization of party members and cadres, maintain close contact with the people in their jurisdictions, and promptly identify and solve problems;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Some places embed party organizations into Modern real estate improves the efficiency of management entities&#39; participation in community public affairs, and improves the happiness index of community residents with higher-quality property services...&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;As big as a big country is, it also has the weight of a big country. Thousands of things, in the final analysis, are the affairs of thousands of households. To deeply implement the &quot;Maple Bridge Experience&quot; in the new era and vigorously strengthen the construction of grassroots party organizations, the key is to adhere to and implement the party&#39;s mass line well, and to solve the urgent, difficult and anxious problems of the masses with heart and soul. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;In recent years, Beijing has innovatively carried out the reform of &quot;party building leads the way and handles complaints immediately&quot;. The municipal party committee secretary holds a monthly special meeting of the municipal party committee and a monthly work review meeting of the district party committee (department party group) secretary. The district party committee secretary holds a monthly review meeting of the street and township party committee secretaries. The street and township party committee secretaries directly dispatch the village and social party organization secretaries. The vast majority of party members and cadres go to the grassroots, run work orders, follow procedures, and stay in positions, focusing on the front line, the masses, and problems. Nowadays, as long as people call 12345 to report problems, someone will immediately respond and accept the problem, and we strive to ensure that the problem is handled quickly and completed. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Party building leads and unites efforts. Today, in the fields, on the streets, and in the buildings of business districts, the party&#39;s political leadership, ideological guidance, mass organization, and social appeal are fully exerted. The party&#39;s political advantages, organizational advantages, and close ties with the masses are constantly transformed into grassroots Governance effectiveness. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;It will further demonstrate the thinking of the rule of law and form a strong atmosphere of doing things according to the law, finding methods when encountering problems, solving problems and resolving conflicts by relying on the law&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Entering a new era, Social governance faces new challenges. How to uphold and develop the &quot;Maple Bridge Experience&quot; in the new era and resolve various conflicts and disputes with high quality? &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The rule of law is the basic way of governing the country. The report of the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China proposed: &quot;Promote multi-level and multi-field governance according to law, and improve the level of legalization of social governance.&quot;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;In 2022, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council issued the &quot;Regulations on Letters and Calls&quot; to incorporate letters and calls into the rule of law. We should guide all localities and departments to persist in using legal thinking to understand problems and use legal methods to solve problems. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Nowadays, whether it is land expropriation, house demolition, labor relations mediation, community property management, ecological environment protection, and business environment optimization, the majority of party members and cadres insist on strengthening the use of legal thinking and the rule of law to determine Disputes were resolved and cases were resolved, effectively safeguarding the legitimate rights and interests of the masses and maintaining social harmony and stability. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;In a criminal complaint case of intentional injury in a certain place, in order to help the complainant untie the &quot;heart knot&quot; and repair the relationship between the community and neighbors, the prosecutor&#39;s office invited lawyers, mediators, street staff representatives, etc. as hearing persons , went to the complainant’s community to hold a public hearing, and successfully settled the complaint. In recent years, in order to reduce the number of complaints filed by petitioners, procuratorial organs in various places have vigorously promoted simple public hearings; at the same time, in order to allow petitioners with physical disabilities or living in remote areas to participate in public hearings, procuratorial organs have also innovatively used the new form of &quot;door-to-door hearings&quot;. Resolve conflicts at the &quot;doorsteps&quot; of petitioners. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The construction of the rule of law must not only focus on the end to treat the disease, but also focus on the front end to treat the disease before it occurs. Nowadays, many places are exploring innovations, putting non-litigation dispute resolution mechanisms at the forefront, pushing more legal forces to guide and ease, and strengthening the prevention of conflicts and disputes at the source, front-end resolution, and checkpoint control. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Shanghai has built a unified platform for online and offline mediation work, and has fully established non-litigation dispute resolution centers at the municipal and district levels. Hundreds of mediation organizations have settled in, and other mediation organizations and notarization, arbitration , administrative adjudication, administrative reconsideration and other institutions are regularly stationed to resolve conflicts through joint efforts;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Guangdong Province actively promotes commercial mediation work. There are 330 commercial mediation organizations in the province and 2,232 registered commercial mediators. Since 2022, Mediated 25,000 commercial disputes;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Zhejiang courts vigorously promoted the construction of an &quot;online diversified dispute resolution platform&quot; to provide the public with one-stop services such as online consultation, mediation, and litigation, and realized &quot;funnel-style&quot; resolution of conflicts and disputes. Through layer-by-layer filtering, a total of 3.276 million disputes have been mediated...&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;As a legal system with Chinese characteristics, people&#39;s mediation plays a fundamental role in the diversified resolution mechanism for conflicts and disputes. Statistics from the Ministry of Justice show that there are 693,000 people&#39;s mediation committees across the country, basically forming an organizational network covering urban and rural areas and key areas and units. In 2022, the National People&#39;s Mediation Organization mediated 14.94 million conflicts and disputes of various types. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Wu Jingjing, director of the People’s Mediation Committee of Xiangyun Town, Wen County, Henan Province, has been engaged in mediation work for 11 years. She said: &quot;When the masses find me, it means they trust me. Letting the masses&#39; troubles be properly resolved is the goal I have always pursued.&quot;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;In 2021, Wu Jingjing obtained the legal professional qualification certificate. In the past few years, she has used her professional expertise to promote legal knowledge, answer legal questions, and write legal documents. She has received more than 2,800 legal consultations. &quot;Mastering legal knowledge adds the ability to do mass work. If you speak reasonably and do things fairly, the people will be convinced.&quot; Wu Jingjing said. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Use legal thinking to prevent conflicts at the source, focusing on cultivating a profound legal culture. If everyone believes in the Fa and follows the Fa in everything, there will naturally be fewer conflicts. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;A unique mock trial was held at the Demonstration Training Base for Legally Comprehensive People in Fuzhou City, Jiangxi Province. The protagonists of the &quot;trial&quot; were &quot;legally savvy people&quot; who were mainly village cadres. In interpreting the law based on cases, &quot;people who understand the law&quot; gradually understand how to protect their own rights and interests reasonably and legally. Since 2015, Chongren County, Fuzhou City has been exploring the cultivation of a &quot;law-savvy person&quot; in every household in the county, and the rural customs and folk customs have been completely renewed. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Nowadays, the implementation of the training project of &quot;legally literate people&quot; in rural (community) has been included in the national &quot;Eighth Five-Year Plan&quot; for legal popularization. As of June this year, more than 3.83 million &quot;law-savvy people&quot; have been cultivated across the country, basically achieving full coverage of &quot;law-savvy people&quot; in all administrative villages. They are like sowing &quot;seeds of the rule of law&quot;. The concept of rule of law, which is to act according to the law, find the law when encountering problems, use the law to solve problems, and resolve conflicts by relying on the law, has taken root at the grassroots level in rural areas. Grassroots governance combines autonomy, rule of law, and rule of virtue. The system is more sound. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Give more emphasis on scientific and technological support, and improve the grassroots governance platform with grid management, refined services, and information support&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Social governance must be good at serving the people. Combine the Party&#39;s fine traditions with new technologies and new means to innovate mechanisms to benefit the people, serve the people, and relieve the people&#39;s worries. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&quot;Someone in the community is competing with me for a parking space. Please handle it as soon as possible.&quot; A few days ago, Ms. Wu, who lives in Qinglongtan Community, Decheng District, Dezhou City, Shandong Province, reported a conflict and dispute online through a small program on her mobile phone. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;It turned out that Ms. Wu parked her car in a public parking space in the community, but her neighbor Brother Zhang said that he had already occupied the parking space. The two refused to give in to each other and had a dispute. After receiving the situation report, the Decheng District Grid Governance Platform dispatched orders as soon as possible. The grid mediator immediately went to the scene to explain the law, reason and feelings. In the end, the matter was properly resolved and both parties shook hands and made peace. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The integration of manpower and technology is one of the most distinctive features of the development of &quot;Maple Bridge Experience&quot; to this day. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;In recent years, in the process of adhering to and developing the &quot;Maple Bridge Experience&quot; in the new era, many localities and departments have made full use of big data, cloud computing and other technologies to innovate the methods and means of grassroots governance, and strive to build and improve The grassroots governance platform with grid management, refined services and information support makes governance smarter and more efficient. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Kaifeng City, Henan Province has built a multi-network integrated three-dimensional social governance and supervision system to realize command, dispatch, and verification anytime and anywhere, greatly improving the efficiency of conflict and dispute resolution;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Guangzhou City, Guangdong Province The People&#39;s Court of Huangpu District has developed the &quot;Pu Law and Good Governance e-Platform&quot; to resolve conflicts and disputes on the palm of your hand and at any time through online mediation;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Jimei District, Xiamen City, Fujian Province has established a &quot;Smart Jimei&quot; social governance command center line Go to the platform, coordinate the resources of all parties, and respond to the demands of the masses in a timely and efficient manner...&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The best way to govern society is to resolve conflicts before they occur. The application of scientific and technological means has not only improved the efficiency of resolving conflicts and disputes, but also enhanced the ability of early warning, prediction and prevention, making urban and rural areas more peaceful and the people more at ease. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&quot;Secretary Liu, the intelligent prevention and control system has issued a fire warning. The location is in the Cao Family Courtyard. Please go and understand the situation immediately. We will arrive soon.&quot; Not long ago, the Public Security Bureau of Shizhu Tujia Autonomous County, Chongqing City The &quot;Safe Village·Smart Farmhouse&quot; intelligent prevention and control system of the Guantian Police Station of Zhongyi Police Station issued an early warning message, and the police on duty immediately contacted Liu Chengyong, secretary of the Party branch of Pingba Village in the jurisdiction. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;After on-site investigation, it was found that a short circuit in the electrical wiring of Cao, a villager in the area, ignited the firewood pile. Thanks to the timely warning of the intelligent prevention and control system, relevant personnel arrived quickly and extinguished the source of the fire immediately to avoid losses. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;From early warning and containing a hidden danger, to analyzing and deploying a type of problem, many places also use big data methods to analyze the overall security situation and outstanding problems in the jurisdiction, and take targeted measures. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;A call from the &quot;police&quot; made Ms. Li from Xinqiao Town, Rong County, Zigong City, Sichuan Province nervous: Worried about a &quot;very serious&quot; economic case, Ms. Li followed the other party&#39;s prompts and came to A hotel in the county town &quot;resolved through negotiation.&quot; Just when she downloaded the APP provided by the other party and prepared to transfer money, the police from Xuyang Police Station of Rong County Public Security Bureau rushed to the hotel and successfully prevented a telecommunications fraud. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Which type of people are easily deceived, and which area has more police incidents... Relying on the construction of public security big data applications, the Rong County Public Security Bureau has integrated the prevention of telecommunications fraud into grassroots governance, and promoted the construction of &quot;Skynet&quot; and &quot;Smart Community&quot; &quot;Create, quickly check and accurately judge the clues of key personnel involved in fraud, and promptly remind and dissuade the defrauded people. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Nowadays, similar intelligent platforms and intelligent terminals are widely used. Through the digitization and informatization of the actual situation in the jurisdiction and various business tasks, we build a series of models and set a series of indicators to strengthen the dynamic monitoring, research and analysis of various risks and hidden dangers, and the social conflict risk early warning, command and dispatch, and closed-loop processing capabilities have been effectively improved. Improve and strive to achieve the transformation from &quot;no handing over of conflicts&quot; to &quot;less or no occurrence of conflicts&quot;. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Pay more attention to social participation and improve the social governance system of joint construction, joint governance and sharing&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;When you walk into Fengqiao Town today, you can always see a group of people wearing People in red vests walk around the streets, greeting the masses and helping them solve their problems. Although they are of different ages and occupations, they have a common name - &quot;Red Maple Vigilante&quot;. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Since the establishment of the &quot;Red Maple Vigilantes&quot; in 2017, the volunteer team has continued to grow and is located in various administrative villages in Fengqiao Town. They assist in security patrols, legal publicity, dispute mediation and other tasks, and are known as popular among the masses. The &quot;new police force&quot; of Maple Bridge is safe. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Grassroots affairs are many and complicated. We cannot rely solely on government departments. We must give full play to the role of all aspects of society and stimulate the vitality of the whole society. The affairs of the masses should be discussed with the masses, and everyone should participate in everyone&#39;s affairs. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, all localities and departments have insisted on integrity and innovation, paid more attention to social participation, and further improved the social governance system of joint construction, joint governance and sharing. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Some places give full play to the role of party members in setting an example, and encourage in-service party members to report to grid party branches, take the lead in participating in community governance, carry out voluntary services, and implement commitments; &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Some places fully implement Give full play to grid workers, security guards, volunteers, Xinxiang Xian, &quot;five old personnel&quot; (retired comrades such as veteran cadres, veteran soldiers, veteran experts, veteran teachers, veteran models), and safety volunteers who are close to the masses and familiar with the situation. Advantages, extend work reach, and improve the effect of preventing and resolving conflicts and disputes;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Some places adopt measures such as &quot;points system&quot; rewards and selection of building team leaders to stimulate the enthusiasm of the masses to participate in grassroots governance, and widely mobilize the masses to carry out Volunteer service activities such as infrastructure management and security, security patrols and prevention, conflict and dispute resolution, safety hazard investigation, and care for special groups;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;In some places, for industries prone to conflicts and disputes such as medical care, labor, and commerce, Give full play to the role of the market mechanism and guide market entities and social organizations to use their professional advantages and participate in resolution work...&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Today, there are groups such as the &quot;Chaoyang Masses&quot; in Beijing and the &quot;Alley Stewards&quot; in Tianjin. With continuous development and growth, a social governance community in which everyone has responsibilities, everyone fulfills his responsibilities, and everyone enjoys is gradually established. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Social participation requires not only gathering the wisdom and efforts of all people, but also listening to the voices of the people and following their will. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&quot;What are your opinions and suggestions on environmental improvement work?&quot; &quot;What are the difficulties in industrial development?&quot;... As night fell, in Yelaowu Central Village, Liangting Township, Huaining County, Anhui Province, cadres and the masses sat together on a street. The stools talked about the shortcomings of parents and the revitalization of the countryside, starting a &quot;rural night talk&quot;. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Huaining County actively promotes the normalization and long-term effectiveness of &quot;Rural Night Talk&quot;. The majority of party members and cadres insist on visiting and chatting among villagers, collecting village conditions and public opinion, listening to opinions and suggestions, and allowing villagers to govern in the countryside. &quot;Playing the leading role&quot; in the film. Since this year, &quot;Country Night Talk&quot; has been held in 232 local villages (communities) for more than 1,400 times. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The people are the &quot;source of running water&quot; for grassroots social governance. Only by mobilizing the enthusiasm and initiative of the broad masses of the people to the greatest extent can the greatest synergy of grassroots social governance be formed. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Haikou City in Hainan Province has established a &quot;community council&quot;, Chongqing City has implemented &quot;yard autonomy&quot; for rural neighborhood disputes, and Yueyang City in Hunan Province has carried out &quot;heroes to distinguish right from wrong&quot;...
