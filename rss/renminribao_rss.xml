Viewed vertically, the increment brought by 1 percentage point of my country&#39;s economic growth is equivalent to about 2.1 percentage points 10 years ago. As the scale of the economy continues to increase, my country&#39;s current annual GDP increment has far exceeded the annual GDP in the early 1990s. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Looking at the weight, this is growth with a higher proportion and greater contribution. Even if the growth rate slows down, my country&#39;s GDP growth last year was still equivalent to the economic aggregate of a medium-sized country. As the second largest economy, my country&#39;s economic aggregate accounts for approximately 18% of the global economy, and has contributed more than 30% to world economic growth for many consecutive years. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Looking at quality, this is growth with less energy consumption and stronger innovation. Energy consumption per unit of GDP dropped by 26.4%, water consumption per unit of GDP dropped by 45%, and carbon dioxide emissions per unit of GDP dropped by 34.4%... From 2012 to 2021, my country&#39;s average annual energy consumption growth rate of 3% supported an average economic growth of 6.6% , becoming one of the countries with the fastest reduction in energy intensity in the world. At the same time, my country’s ranking rose to 11th in the Global Innovation Index, successfully entering the ranks of innovative countries. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Since the beginning of this year, my country&#39;s economy has continued to recover and has made solid progress in high-quality development. The economic growth rate of 5.2% in the first three quarters ranks among the best among major international economies. However, short-term fluctuations in some economic indicators have caused some people to worry about the prospects of my country&#39;s economic development, including various arguments that &quot;speak negatively&quot; of China. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Understanding the general trend of my country&#39;s economy, the increase or decrease in economic indicators is important, but we cannot be led by the fluctuations of short-term indicators. We must have historical patience and strategic determination, maintain confidence and a normal mind, and use a comprehensive To look at problems from a dialectical and long-term perspective, we must not only look at the short-term &quot;shape&quot;, but also the long-term &quot;potential&quot;, not only the &quot;quantity&quot; of growth, but also the &quot;quality&quot; of development. Through one percentage point With GDP growth, we can see clearly the general logic of high-quality economic development in our country. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The high-quality development of our country’s economy is a development with higher gold content. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;When observing economic development, we need to know not only what is happening but also why. At present, our country&#39;s economy is in a critical period of transforming development concepts, optimizing economic structure, and transforming growth momentum. What is more important than growth rate is the improvement of development quality and the conversion of old and new driving forces. Since the beginning of this year, our country&#39;s economy has continued to gain advantages and take the initiative in structural adjustment, transformation and upgrading. From January to October, the total retail sales of consumer goods increased by 6.9%, the retail sales of services increased by 19.0%, the added value of industries above designated size increased by 4.1%, and the service industry production index increased by 7.9%... Stronger power, better structure, and higher efficiency Economic growth continues to enhance the value of economic development. With the recent intensive implementation of consumption-promoting measures by the National Development and Reform Commission and other departments, the &quot;main engine&quot; of consumption will continue to increase. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The high-quality development of our country’s economy is a development with stronger driving force. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Throughout the history of world economics, countries that have successfully transformed into high-income economies have all relied on continuous innovation to improve the quality of development and complete the transition from a factor-driven development model to an innovation-driven development model. of successful conversion. In recent years, the innovation-driven development strategy has been implemented in depth, making every percentage point of my country&#39;s economic growth more technologically intensive. The &quot;three new&quot; economy, with new industries, new formats, and new business models as the main content, is growing rapidly. In 2022, the added value will exceed 20 trillion yuan for the first time, accounting for 17.36% of GDP. From January to October this year, investment in high-tech industries increased by 11.1% year-on-year. The &quot;first driving force&quot; of innovation has become increasingly strong, promoting the economy to achieve steady and long-term development on the road of high-quality development. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;my country’s high-quality economic development is a development that brings a greater sense of gain. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Enhancing people&#39;s livelihood and well-being is the fundamental purpose of development. International experience shows that the employment-driven efficiency of the tertiary industry is about 20% higher than that of the secondary industry. As the proportion of the service industry in GDP has steadily increased, my country&#39;s current GDP growth of 1 percentage point can create about 2 million new jobs. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Since the beginning of this year, the service industry, especially the contact-based cluster service industry, has recovered relatively quickly, and its role in promoting employment has been significantly enhanced. From January to September, 10.22 million new jobs were created in cities and towns across the country, completing 85% of the full-year target. At present, the booming development of emerging industries has given rise to new occupational needs such as Internet of Things engineering technicians and big data engineering technicians, which will effectively expand employment space. The stable employment base has laid a solid foundation and created good conditions for achieving common prosperity in high-quality development. In the first three quarters, the per capita disposable income of national residents actually increased by 5.9% year-on-year, which is faster than the GDP growth rate. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“The deeper you go, the harder it is to get in.” Today, national rejuvenation has entered a critical stage, the journey of Chinese-style modernization is more ambitious, and time is more pressing. We must clearly realize that the larger the economy, the higher the quality, and the less energy consumption, the higher the requirements and difficulty of development. This also means that a GDP growth of 1 percentage point requires us to make more efforts and meet greater challenges. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“On our new journey, our future is bright, but the road ahead will not be smooth sailing.” General Secretary Xi Jinping’s sonorous words are inspiring and inspiring. Looking forward to the future, my country&#39;s economic development has a long way to go. We must continue to climb over obstacles and overcome difficulties with the persistence of never letting go of the green hills and the sobriety of walking a hundred miles.

The growth rate is also among the highest in the country. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The rapid growth in the number of new energy heavy trucks in Tangshan is closely related to the rapidly growing local new energy industry. In the past two years, Tangshan has intensively introduced plans and implementation plans for the development of new energy industries such as hydrogen energy and photovoltaics, and established a multi-energy complementary new energy pattern of &quot;wind, solar, water, fire, hydrogen storage and ammonia&quot;. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;In June this year, Zhongrong Technology’s 10,000 standard cubic meters/hour battery fuel hydrogen project, the country’s largest iron and steel industry (coking) tail gas fuel hydrogen production project, was put into operation in Tangshan. The project has an annual output of 7,200 tons of hydrogen for fuel cells, which can meet the needs of 700 fuel cell heavy-duty trucks and other fuel cell vehicles every day. In addition, a large number of key new energy projects have been accelerated in Tangshan. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Develop new energy industries and build a green industrial system. In addition to relying on new energy heavy trucks to build an industrial &quot;green transportation&quot; system, Tangshan has also accelerated the implementation of the &quot;green steel&quot; plan and promoted the city&#39;s 20 steel companies to build distributed photovoltaic power generation of 109,900 kilowatts, with 37,400 kilowatts under construction. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&quot;At present, Tangshan&#39;s annual green power production capacity is 4.1 billion kilowatt-hours and its annual automotive hydrogen production capacity is 9,000 tons, which can help reduce carbon emissions by 1.32 million tons. It is expected that by 2025, Tangshan City will have an annual production capacity of 9,000 tons. 8 billion kilowatt-hours of green power and 28,000 tons of hydrogen for vehicles have helped reduce carbon emissions by 2.76 million tons, making Tangshan&#39;s contribution to achieving carbon peak and carbon neutrality goals and accelerating its own high-quality development.&quot; said Wu Weidong, Secretary of the Tangshan Municipal Party Committee. &lt;/p>;&lt;!--/enpcontent-->;</description><pubDate> Mon, 20 Nov 2023 05:26:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[01版要闻 - 全力守护绿水青山]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://paper.people.com.cn/rmrb/html/2023-11/20/nw.D110000renmrb_20231120_5-01.htm]]><description> &lt;div>;Monday, November 20, 2023&lt;/div>; &lt;TABLE width=&quot;100%&quot;>;&lt;TBODY>;&lt;TR>;&lt;TD align=&quot;center&quot;>;&lt;IMG width=&quot;100%&quot; src=&quot;http ://paper.people.com.cn/rmrb/images/1/20231120/1700422577002_1.jpg&quot;>;&lt;/TD>;&lt;/TR>; &lt;TR>;&lt;TD>;&lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;/TD>;&lt; /TR>;&lt;/TBODY>;&lt;/TABLE>; &lt;!--enpcontent-->;&lt;P>;In recent years, Huangshan City, Anhui Province has firmly established and practiced the concept that lucid waters and lush mountains are invaluable assets, and has collaboratively promoted carbon reduction and carbon reduction. pollution, green expansion, growth, and the quality of the ecological environment continues to improve. &lt;/P>;&lt;P>;The picture shows on November 18, tourists were sightseeing in Hongcun, Yixian County, Huangshan City to experience the pleasant ecology. &lt;/P>;&lt;P>;Hong&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Xingshe (Image China)&lt;/P>;&lt;!--/enpcontent-->; &lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best &quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 20 Nov 2023 05:26:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[01版要闻 - 前三季度新改建农村公路11.8万公里（新数据 新看点）]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://paper.people.com.cn/rmrb/html/2023-11/20/nw.D110000renmrb_20231120_6-01.htm]]><description> &lt;div>;Monday, November 20, 2023&lt;/div>; &lt;TABLE width=&quot;100%&quot;>;&lt;TBODY>;&lt;TR>;&lt;TD align=&quot;center&quot;>;&lt;IMG width=&quot;100%&quot; src=&quot;http ://paper.people.com.cn/rmrb/images/2023-11/20/01/rmrb2023112001p20_b.jpg&quot;>;&lt;/TD>;&lt;/TR>; &lt;TR>;&lt;TD>;&lt;p>;Data source: Transportation Department&lt;BR/>;Cartography: Shen Yiling&lt;/p>;&lt;/TD>;&lt;/TR>;&lt;/TBODY>;&lt;/TABLE>; &lt;!--enpcontent-->;&lt;P>;This newspaper, Beijing, November 19th&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp ; (Reporter Han Xin) The reporter recently learned from the Ministry of Transport: In the first three quarters of this year, China&#39;s rural roads completed fixed asset investment of 358.7 billion yuan, a year-on-year increase of 5.1%; 118,000 kilometers of rural roads were newly renovated, completing nine of the annual goals and tasks We have implemented 78,000 kilometers of rural highway safety and life protection projects, renovated 5,409 dangerous bridges on rural highways, and installed 15,000 speed bumps at 7,679 rural highway level crossings across the country. &lt;/P>;&lt;P>;Since the beginning of this year, transportation departments in various regions have made key deployments and actively promoted rural road construction and achieved solid results, basically establishing a rural road network that is convenient, efficient, inclusive and equitable. &lt;/P>;&lt;P>;The road network continues to expand.

Construction of the railway started in 2014. Thanks to the unremitting efforts of more than 20,000 builders over a period of nine years, it will be put into operation in the near future. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Overcoming Snow Mountain Tunnel Construction Difficulties&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The Lixiang Section of the Yunnan-Tibet Railway is located in the northwest of Yunnan Province, the southeastern edge of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, and the middle section of the Hengduan Mountains. Mountains and ridges are connected by bridges and tunnels - 34 new bridges and 20 tunnels have been built across the entire line, with the bridge-to-tunnel ratio as high as 73.4%. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Large deformation of soft rock, high ground stress, high temperature and abundant water...the geological conditions along the line are complex, posing considerable challenges to construction. Among them, the most difficult tunnel to construct is the Haba Snow Mountain Tunnel. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The Haba Snow Mountain Tunnel, with a total length of 9,523 meters, is a Class I high-risk tunnel and is a key and difficult control project along the entire line. &quot;A tunnel like this that combines ultra-large burial depth, high ground stress and large deformation of soft rock is rare in China.&quot; The Lixiang Section Project Management Department of the China Railway 16th Bureau Yunnan-Tibet Railway undertook the construction of the Haba Snow Mountain Tunnel (hereinafter referred to as the &quot;Lixiang Section Project&quot; Department&quot;) Deputy Manager Liu Zhenwei said. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;In the display cabinet of the Haba Snow Mountain Tunnel Project Department, a row of deformed steel plates caught the reporter&#39;s attention. After experiencing huge external force tearing, the steel plate was shattered. What kind of force is this? Liu Zhenwei explained: &quot;The maximum burial depth of the Haba Snow Mountain Tunnel is 1,155 meters. The ground stress is too strong, which is equivalent to the water pressure of 237 meters in the deep sea.&quot; Generally speaking, the allowable contact pressure of the tunnel&#39;s initial support and secondary lining steel plate is 0.5 MPa. , approximately equal to the pressure 50 meters underwater. However, the measured contact stress during the construction phase of the Haba Snow Mountain Tunnel reached 2.37 MPa, which is nearly five times the maximum allowable contact stress in the design. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;When constructed under such strong ground stress, the tunnel is prone to dangers such as surrounding rock collapse and support deformation. One day in April 2021, the construction team encountered a sudden danger in the tunnel: &quot;Gretting operations were being carried out at the time, and fine powder suddenly fell from the surrounding rocks around the tunnel face. We evacuated the site urgently.&quot; Liu Zhenwei said, in less than 2 minutes , the surrounding rock collapsed, and the spurting surrounding rock pushed the gunite machine weighing several hundred kilograms out more than ten meters. Recalling the shocking moment, Liu Zhenwei still has lingering fears. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Driving, collapsing, and digging again... the builders struggled repeatedly with the surrounding rocks. In order to overcome the construction difficulties, the participating units invited experts to go deep into the tunnel to &quot;check the pulse&quot; and formed a set of technical measures of &quot;first release, then resistance, and combination of resistance&quot;. &quot;First dig a middle guide tunnel at the main tunnel position to release part of the ground stress, then expand the middle guide tunnel, and strengthen the support during the expansion process.&quot; Liu Zhenwei said that general tunnel support only requires a lining. Ichigo, but the Haba Snow Mountain Tunnel uses a lining of three protectors to offset ground stress. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;On July 8 this year, the Haba Snow Mountain Tunnel was finally completed. Li Decheng, the laboratory director of the Lixiang Section Project Department, who had retired last October: &quot;This is the last tunnel built in my career and the most difficult tunnel. Now I can rest assured to retire!&quot; &lt;/P>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; Steel long dragons complement each other with green mountains and green mountains &lt;/strong>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; There are multiple scenic spots and nature reserves along the Liliang Section of the Yunnan -Tibet Railway, accompanied by the green mountains and green mountains. Because it is located in high altitude areas, the ecological environment is very fragile. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In order to reduce the impact of construction on the ecology along the line, the participating parties adhere to the concept of green development and adhere to environmental protection and soil and water conservation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; About 40 meters from the import of Haba Snow Mountain Tunnel, the reporter saw a sewage treatment station covering more than 400 square meters. A stout pipeline was revealed from the tunnel and connected to the front sedimentation tank of the sewage treatment station. The tunnel pouring water and construction wastewater are for the first time, filtering particulate matter such as gravel and sediment, and then enter the sewage treatment station. The water after treatment must be settled by the end -at three levels of sewage sedimentation tanks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;The Import of the Haba Snow Mountain Tunnel is located in the Tiger Jumping Gorge Tourist Scenic Area and the Jinsha River Water Source Reserve. Before starting the start, we built this sewage treatment station.&quot; Diao Feng, the person in charge of the leadership group, told reporters that the processed wastewater was then used for water reduction in the construction site, mixing and stations and other areas, which was used in the work area. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The recycling of wastewater is used, and the waste soil abandon slag is concentrated and unified. The Lixiang section Jinsha River Special Bridge on both sides of the Jinsha River is the Harba Snow Mountain and Yulong Snow Mountain Nature Reserve. The bridge inheritance is far from the environmental sensitive area when the site is selected from the Sakura Bridge Bureau. , Dip the surface soil as much as possible, and then abandon the soil from low to high. After the residue is completed, according to the re -reclamation plan, the divestitudes are used to re -green with the divestitudes of the soil. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;Every time in the rain, we will arrange a special person to inspect the hidden dangers of environmental risks such as abandoning residue fields, mixing and stations, and check if there is a ditch to block or the slope collapse and cause water and soil loss.&quot; The China Railway Bridge Bureau Jinsha Bureau Wu Xiaoguan, head of the Jiangte Bridge project department, said. &lt;/P>; &lt;p>; According to reports, the Liliang Section of the Yunnan -Tibet Railway has built a total of 8 sewage treatment stations, built more than 40 sedimentation tanks, about 105,000 cubic meters of protection facilities, and about 187,000 square meters of green planting , Spread out the harmonious scroll of the steel long dragon and the green mountains and green mountains. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; Fill the gap in the road network and promote the development of the route &lt;/strong>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; After the Lixiang section of the Yunnan -Tibet Railway is opened to traffic, the Diqing Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture will end the history of the railway. This will fill the gap in the railway network in northwestern Yunnan, improve the traffic pattern in the region, and promote the high -quality development of the economy and society along the route. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; For tourists in Lijiang and Diqing, the railway is about to open up is an exciting news. The train crosses the Jinsha River north, via Xiaodian to Shangri -La, and passes through famous scenic spots such as Yulong Snow Mountain, Tiger Jumping Gorge, Haba Snow Mountain, and crosses the regions to gather places such as Tibetan, Yi, and Bai. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Duan Shuying, a villager in Hujuexia Town, Shangri -La, is looking forward to the opening of the railway. In August of this year, her farmhouses were put into use in the renovation. After the expansion, there were 30 guest rooms, and 20 boardwatch tourists can be received. &quot;My family is only more than 20 kilometers from the Tiger Jumping Gorge Scenic Area. After the railway is opened to traffic, it can bring more tourists, and the business will definitely be more popular.&quot; Duan Shuying said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; He Lan, the person in charge of the Xinyunling Travel Agency, Lijiang City, has always paid attention to the progress of railway construction. In the past, it could only take a car from Lijiang to Shangri -La. The rainy season was not good, and it took more than 3 hours. After the opening of the railway, the two places have greatly increased, and the number of tourists is expected to increase significantly. He Lan believes that from the long run, the railway will connect the area into a &quot;big scenic spot&quot; to promote the development of tourism in western Yunnan. &lt;/P>; &lt;p>; The opening of the Lixiang section of the Yunnan -Tibet Railway is of great significance to drive the industrial development of the region along the route and promote rural revitalization. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Talking about the topic of the railway is about to open to traffic, Zhuomaram, the head of Shangri -La Plateau Craft Craft Beer Co., Ltd., said: &quot;Now our packaging materials come in through highway freight, encounter rain and snow weather, roads, highways, highways The unstable transportation will affect the production of enterprises. Railway freight is more secure, stable, and efficient. Our green beer can also move towards a wider market. &quot;&lt;/P>; &lt;p>; According to Shangri -La Customs, from January to September this year, Di The total value of Qing Dynasty was 26.17 million yuan, and the export products were mainly characteristic agricultural products such as Qingya Beer, Matsutake, Berobacteria, and wine. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;The Liliang section of the Yunnan -Tibet Railway is integrated into my country&#39;s developed transportation network, which will be in line with international channels such as the Chinese and Lao Lao Railway and the Western Luhai New Channel. There will be more markets that are in a wider market for the plateau. &quot;&lt;/P>; &lt;!-/Enpcontent->;</description><pubDate> Mon, 20 Nov 2023 05:26:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[02版要闻 - 关于评选表彰第九届全国道德模范的通知]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://paper.people.com.cn/rmrb/html/2023-11/20/nw.D110000renmrb_20231120_3-02.htm]]><description> &lt;div>; Monday, November 20, 2023 &lt;/div>; &lt;!-ENPCONTENT->; &lt;p>; Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, November 19th &amp; nbsp; &amp; nbsp; Central Propaganda Department, Central Spiritual Civilization Construction Office The Political Work Department of the Trade Union, the Communist Youth League, the National Women&#39;s Federation, and the Central Military Commission recently issued the &quot;Notice on the selection and recognition of the ninth national moral model&quot;.
