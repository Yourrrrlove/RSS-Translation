They have to kick up the loess to make it look good.&quot;&lt;/P>;&lt;P>;From Looking at Shaanxi from northern Shaanxi, the land of Sanqin in winter has strong momentum for green development. &lt;/P>;&lt;P>;In May this year, General Secretary Xi Jinping pointed out when listening to the work report of the Shaanxi Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial Government: &quot;We must focus on promoting the green and low-carbon transformation of the development model and improve the level of ecological civilization construction.&quot; Keep in mind General Secretary Xi Jinping&#39;s Yin Yin He entrusted the cadres and masses of Shaanxi Province to abide by &quot;green&quot; to shape the ecology, pursue &quot;green&quot; for the future, and use green to empower high-quality development. &lt;/P>;&lt;P>;Green has become the background color for Shaanxi’s ecological development in the new era. &lt;/P>;&lt;P>;There is Mu Us Sandy Land in the north, and the green net locks the quicksand; in the south, there is the Hanjiang River and Danjiang River, a long stream of clear water; the Qinling Mountains merge into the north and south, and the Yellow River divides Shaanxi and Shanxi. To protect the ecology, Shaanxi insists that Qingshan will not relax. &lt;/P>;&lt;P>;Artificial afforestation, aerial seeding afforestation, mountain closure for afforestation... Shaanxi continues to increase greening and protect greening, and solidly promotes major ecological projects such as improving the quality, efficiency and high-quality development of protective forests along the Yellow River. In the past 10 years, more than 9,100 afforestation has been completed. Thousands of acres. The green territory has been advanced more than 400 kilometers north, and Yan&#39;an, Yulin and other places have become &quot;national forest cities&quot;. &lt;/P>;&lt;P>;Protecting the environment and ecology has caused some places in Shaanxi to struggle, but they have persisted. &lt;/P>;&lt;P>;Caoba Village, Yang County, Hanzhong City, is located in the core area of ​​the Crested Ibis Reserve. &quot;The crested ibis has high environmental requirements and can serve as our &#39;quality inspector&#39; and &#39;spokesperson.&#39;&quot; said Liu Yuhua, secretary of the village party branch. Some people were once puzzled: &quot;How can we grow the land if we are not allowed to use pesticides and fertilizers?&quot; The idea has changed: the dry land has been restored to paddy fields, organic fertilizers have been used, and insecticidal lamps have been installed... This once-famous poverty-stricken village has solved the problem of &quot; &quot;Contradictory button&quot; is combined into a &quot;chain of wealth&quot;, and the secret lies in two words - &quot;organic&quot;. Today, Yang County has certified 110 kinds of organic products in 15 categories and a certified area of ​​170,800 acres. Good ecology brings good days. &lt;/P>;&lt;P>;People will not let down the green mountains, and the green mountains will never let down people. Apples from Weibei and northern Shaanxi, kiwis from the north and south of the Qinling Mountains, edible fungi from southern Shaanxi, and selenium-rich agricultural products from Qinba... holding an ecological bowl and eating ecological rice, Shaanxi &quot;digs gold&quot; from the ecology, making good mountains and rivers &quot; &quot;Look&quot; is more &quot;value&quot;. &lt;/P>;&lt;P>;Industry must also be green. Shaanxi, which is rich in energy resources, strives to promote the green transformation of the energy industry. &lt;/P>;&lt;P>;In Shaanxi Yanchang Petroleum Yulin Coal Chemical Co., Ltd., through capture, utilization and storage, liquefied carbon dioxide replaces water and is injected into underground oil flooding. &quot;Last year, we built a carbon dioxide capture project with an annual scale of 300,000 tons, and the annual carbon reduction is equivalent to nearly 17 million trees.&quot; said Feng Chenghai, the company&#39;s general manager. &lt;/P>;&lt;P>;To reduce carbon emissions and turn from &quot;black&quot; to &quot;green&quot;, Shaanxi is working hard on chain extension, chain repair and chain strengthening. Shaanxi has basically formed a modern coal chemical industry chain such as coal-to-oil, coal-to-ethylene glycol, and coal-based high-end chemicals. Among them, the output value of the coal-to-olefins (aromatic hydrocarbons) industry chain has reached hundreds of billions of yuan, and its production capacity ranks among the top in the country. &lt;/P>;&lt;P>;Shaanxi, which cherishes green, has tasted the gift of green, and has made greater efforts to improve the greenness of its economy and form a new growth point for green development. &lt;/P>;&lt;P>;In the first 10 months of this year, the total output value of Shaanxi&#39;s automobile manufacturing industry increased by 32.2% year-on-year. Among the new energy vehicles sold on the national market, about 1 in 8 was produced in Shaanxi; the solar photovoltaic industry nationwide Leading the way, products are sold at home and abroad; industrial clusters such as the semiconductor industry and aviation industry continue to develop, and their output value ranks among the top in the country... Green concepts are integrated into industrial development, and the construction of a modern industrial system in Shaanxi is accelerating. &lt;/P>;&lt;P>;Development is moving from &quot;new&quot; to &quot;green&quot;, chasing &quot;light&quot; and &quot;chain&quot;. A number of industries with high gold content, new content and green content are accelerating their growth in Sanqin. At present, there are 6 industrial chains in Shaanxi province with an output value exceeding 100 billion yuan. In the first three quarters of this year, the industrial chain achieved an industrial output value of 859.66 billion yuan. &quot;We are accelerating the development of photonics, hydrogen energy, drones, sensors and other industrial chains to become bigger and stronger and create a new engine for economic growth.&quot; said Huang Xinbo, deputy director of the Shaanxi Provincial Department of Industry and Information Technology. &lt;/P>;&lt;P>;Protect and enhance green, use green to strengthen green. The main responsible comrade of the Shaanxi Provincial Party Committee said: &quot;From the ecological background to the development quality, and then to the bright colors of transformation, the path for Shaanxi&#39;s green and low-carbon transformation in the new era is getting wider and wider.&quot;&lt;/P>;&lt;!--/enpcontent-->;</description><pubDate> Wed, 06 Dec 2023 05:56:08 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[01版要闻 - 两手抓  两不误  两促进]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://paper.people.com.cn/rmrb/html/2023-12/06/nw.D110000renmrb_20231206_2-01.htm]]><description> &lt;div>;Wednesday, December 06, 2023&lt;/div>; &lt;!--enpcontent-->;&lt;P>;“Adhering to the party’s leadership is the essential requirement and fundamental guarantee for Chinese-style modernization.” General Secretary Xi Jinping recently visited Shanghai At the same time, clear requirements were put forward around upholding and strengthening the party&#39;s leadership and solidly carrying out the second batch of thematic education, emphasizing that &quot;the second batch of thematic education is coming to an end. We must insist on not lowering the standards and not letting up the momentum, and integrating thematic education with all aspects of work.&quot; Together, we can grasp both sides, make sure both are correct, and promote both.&quot; &lt;/P>;&lt;P>;Carrying out thematic education on studying and implementing Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era is a major task for party building this year and a major event related to the overall situation. Since the launch of the second batch of thematic education, all localities have paid more attention to arming themselves with theory, classified guidance, strengthening the foundation, overall coordination, and leadership guidance, educating and guiding party members and cadres to firmly establish the concept of political performance that benefits the people. Adhere to asking the people for their plans and needs, focus on solving the urgent, difficult and anxious problems of the people, promote &quot;solving a type of problem&quot; by &quot;analyzing a problem&quot;, and effectively transform the enthusiasm for learning and work into overcoming difficulties and doing things The powerful driving force for entrepreneurship will continuously enhance the people&#39;s sense of gain, happiness and security through actual results in all aspects of work. The closer we get to the end, the more we need to be prudent and stay the course, to achieve high quality and good results in thematic education, and to ensure solid results. &lt;/P>;&lt;P>;The most important thing is simplicity. It should be noted that the second batch of thematic education is carried out close to the masses, the contact with the masses is more direct, the contradictions and problems faced are more complex, and the problems that the masses expect to be solved are more specific. The word &quot;real&quot; must be highlighted as it reaches the grassroots level. Insisting on not lowering standards and not slackening motivation, we must implement practical requirements throughout the entire process of thematic education and focus on solving practical problems. It is necessary to listen extensively to the opinions of the masses, take the study and promotion of &quot;four grassroots&quot; as an important starting point, and focus on solving the worries and troubles of the masses, and integrate key measures such as theoretical study, investigation and research, promotion of development, inspection and rectification , and make the work that benefits the people&#39;s livelihood, warms the people&#39;s hearts, and complies with the public opinion close to the hearts of the people. We must insist on proceeding from reality in everything, firmly grasp the goals and tasks of thematic education, study more on actual results and less on form, do not make superficial articles, do not engage in new tricks, and maintain the political nature and seriousness of thematic education with a strict style. It is necessary to firmly grasp the launch of the second batch of thematic education as an important political task, continue to give full play to the role of the leadership system and working mechanism established in the first batch of thematic education, and prevent the tendency of &quot;relaxing&quot; and &quot;resting&quot;, Ensure that theme education starts and ends well and is completed well. &lt;/P>;&lt;P>;Practicality is a distinctive feature of Marxism, and the purpose of learning is all about application. Only by adhering to the two-pronged approach in educational practice, ensuring both correctness and promotion, and preventing &quot;two skins&quot; can the truth power and practical power of the party&#39;s innovative theory be demonstrated. All regions, departments and units must adhere to the center and serve the overall situation, combine the development of thematic education with the implementation of the decisions and arrangements of the Party Central Committee, and the promotion of the central work of the region, department and unit, so as to improve the overall effectiveness of thematic education, Make the process of carrying out thematic education a process of transforming theoretical learning into practical application, and a process for party members and cadres to improve their ability to perform their duties and enhance their responsibility. At the end of the year and the beginning of the new year, the tasks at the end of the year and the beginning of the new year are heavy and there are many work clues. We must adhere to overall planning and balance, properly handle the relationship between thematic education and central work, coordinate the theme education with the comprehensive completion of various work tasks this year, highlight the promotion of high-quality development, and reflect the effectiveness of thematic education in solving problems in advancing the central work , use the effectiveness of central work to test the effectiveness of theme education. &lt;/P>;&lt;P>;For ours, the largest Marxist ruling party in the world, only with strong theory can we have clear direction, unified people and sufficient confidence. Persevere in using Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era to focus our minds and souls, insist on not lowering standards and never letting up on motivation, plan, organize, and implement thematic education well, and do a solid job in theoretical study and investigation and research, and do a solid job While reviewing and rectifying outstanding problems, we will do a good job in doing practical things that benefit the people, and do both, make sure we are correct, and promote both. We will definitely be able to use hard work to promote development, win the trust of the people, and show new achievements in promoting Chinese-style modernization.

Increase the density of bank openings and improve the quality and efficiency of trade finance services... To plan for the future, 20 work points in 7 categories have been refined. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;In April this year, the Ministry of Commerce, together with relevant departments and 13 relevant provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities, held the first meeting of the cooperation working mechanism to promote the construction of the New International Land-Sea Trade Corridor in Chongqing. All parties collide with needs, seek consensus, and promote more efficient cooperation. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The new mechanism promotes the formation of a new layout. At present, a provincial inter-ministerial joint meeting for the New Western Land-Sea Corridor has been established at the national level, and 12 western provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities have formed a &quot;13+2&quot; cooperation mechanism with Hainan Province, Zhanjiang City in Guangdong Province, and Huaihua City in Hunan Province. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The policy effects continue to be released, activating the &quot;innovation pool&quot; for the construction of the New Land-Sea Corridor, and the steady development momentum continues to increase. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;On October 12, a train carrying 950 tons of imported minerals from the New Western Land-Sea Corridor sailed into Chongqing Guoyuan Port. After checking the declaration elements of the enterprise, Chongqing Port Customs determined that the domestic railway freight of 87,400 yuan will not be included in the dutiable value of the goods. This marks the official implementation of the innovative initiative of &quot;Domestic Railway Freight Deduction for Sea-Rail Multimodal Transport under the New Western Land-Sea Corridor&quot;. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“This innovative measure is highly targeted and benefits a wide range of people. It can actually save costs, attract more goods to be transferred along the New Western Land-Sea Corridor, and drive the expansion of the channel to improve quality and efficiency.” Chongqing Customs Xiao Hui, deputy director of the Customs Department, said. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Services are frequently &quot;new&quot;, allowing enterprises to get more benefits. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;With the help of the New Western Land-Sea Corridor, Hengdu Group, a leading enterprise in Fengdu County, Chongqing, imports beef from South America through the rail-sea combined transport cold chain. &quot;Adopting the new &#39;one box to the end&#39; model and changing the inspection location from coastal ports to Chongqing local, transportation routes, logistics costs, port customs clearance, and transit efficiency have been significantly optimized, and market competitiveness has been greatly enhanced.&quot; said Zhu Gangquan, vice president of Hengdu Group. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Relying on the national market procurement and trade method to pilot the Dazu Longshui Hardware Market, Dazu District, Chongqing explores new paths to integrate the construction of international logistics channels and new foreign trade formats, and is assisted by measures such as value-added tax exemption, convenient customs clearance, and innovation in foreign exchange settlement. &quot;Group&quot; export of small commodities...&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;New exploration has given rise to a new atmosphere in the channel. Data show that in 2022, the trade volume between the 13 co-constructed provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities of the Western Land-Sea Corridor and the ten ASEAN countries will exceed US$130 billion, an increase of 73.3% from the beginning of the channel in 2017, and has exceeded US$100 billion for three consecutive years. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Interconnection improves quality and efficiency&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Infrastructure weaves &quot;threads&quot; into a &quot;network&quot;, which is the &quot;road&quot; of the New Western Land-Sea Corridor that fully plays its role One of the keys. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;At Sichuan Chengdu International Railway Port, the Sichuan-Guangxi-Sea Railway Intermodal Trains are operating stably and the shipment volume continues to grow. &quot;Starting from Chengdu and transferring to the ASEAN region via Qinzhou Port in Guangxi can save more than half the time compared with the previous river-sea combined transport method.&quot; Huang Jun, director of the dispatching workshop of Chengdu North Station of China Railway Chengdu Bureau Group Co., Ltd., was deeply touched. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;More changes are taking place across mountains and seas, connecting the world. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;After the new Chengdu-Kunming Railway is opened to traffic at the end of 2022, with the help of the &quot;Lancang-Mekong Express&quot; international freight train, the transportation time from Vientiane, Laos to Chengdu can be shortened to two days and 17 hours. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;In July this year, the upgraded version of the &quot;Lanmei-Rongcheng-Europe Express&quot; was launched.

Specialty products such as Laos rice and Thai durian will enter the Chinese market and be sold to the European market. More western specialties such as &quot;Guizhou Laoganma&quot; will be opened. Also go abroad. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&quot;Taking advantage of&quot; the New Land-Sea Corridor, Meitan County, Zunyi City, Guizhou Province has accelerated the pace of tea exports to the sea, forming a complete tea export industry chain and supply chain. &quot;Most of the company&#39;s products go south along the New Western Land-Sea Corridor, are transported by land to sea ports in Guangxi, and then reach Southeast Asian countries by sea. The time to sea is greatly shortened.&quot; Yu Nenghong, general manager of Zunyi Qiwei Mingxiang Tea Import and Export Co., Ltd. Said, &quot;We have established long-term cooperative relationships with many tea companies in Southeast Asia.&quot; In the first nine months of 2023, Meitan County&#39;s direct tea export volume was US$36.8972 million, a year-on-year increase of 11.4%. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Dushan County, located in the southern part of Guizhou Province, plays the role of the fulcrum of the New Western Land-Sea Corridor to build an important comprehensive logistics distribution center and bulk industrial product trading center in southern Guizhou and northern Guizhou. While promoting the development of an open economy, Promote the development of related industries such as basic materials and new building materials. In the first half of this year, the added value of industries above designated size in Dushan County accounted for more than one-third of the county&#39;s GDP. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Currently, Guizhou is taking the construction of new corridors as a guide to cultivate and build high-quality modern economic and trade corridors and modern industrial corridors, give full play to the driving role of corridors in economic development along the routes, and promote the optimization and upgrading of regional industrial structure. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Relying on advantageous industries such as automobiles and electronic information, Chongqing’s import and export trade volume with countries and regions co-building the “Belt and Road” will reach 333.14 billion yuan in 2022, attracting 319 Fortune 500 companies to Chongqing. invest. Domestic enterprises have cooperated with Laos to build a modern agricultural industrial park project, and have cooperated with Cambodia to explore an integrated banana supply chain of &quot;transportation, trade and industry&quot;... Each of these vivid cases explains the industrial driving effect of the construction of the new land-sea corridor. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Channels bring logistics, logistics brings economy and trade, and economy and trade bring industry, and the linkage effect is increasingly apparent. &quot;The New Western Land-Sea Corridor has become an important link for smooth dual circulation. Using economy and trade to drive more global industrial division of labor and cooperation, linking my country&#39;s western region with Southeast Asian and European markets will help create a new situation of high-quality development.&quot; Liu Wei express. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;(Our reporters Wang Mingfeng and Su Bin participated in the interview)&lt;/p>;&lt;!--/enpcontent-->;</description><pubDate> Wed, 06 Dec 2023 05:56:08 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[01版要闻 - 中央编办等五部门联合印发《关于做好大学生乡村医生专项计划编制保障工作的通知》]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://paper.people.com.cn/rmrb/html/2023-12/06/nw.D110000renmrb_20231206_4-01.htm]]><description> &lt;div>;Wednesday, December 06, 2023&lt;/div>; &lt;!--enpcontent-->;&lt;P>;This newspaper, Beijing, December 5th&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(Reporter Zhao Cheng) Rural doctors are my country’s rural medical and health services At the bottom of the network, the Party Central Committee attaches great importance to the construction of a team of rural doctors.
