The purpose of reforming the audit management system and establishing the Central Audit Committee is to strengthen the centralized and unified leadership of the Party Central Committee on audit work. Since the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, the Central Audit Commission has promoted the systematic and holistic reconstruction of the audit system, and the audit work has made historic achievements and undergone historic changes. Under the centralized and unified leadership of the Party Central Committee, the audit work has embarked on a new audit path that suits China&#39;s national conditions. The governance of the country in the new era has achieved important institutional results in the audit field. First, the reform of the audit management system has been further promoted, and the centralized and unified leadership of the Party Central Committee on audit work has been continuously refined, implemented and institutionalized. Second, the understanding of the regularity of socialist auditing with Chinese characteristics has been continuously deepened. Third, auditing is more proactive and more consistent in serving the overall interests of the party and the country, and its unique supervisory role is more evident. Fourth, the overall pattern of audit rectification has initially taken shape, and the use of audit results has become more smooth, authoritative, and efficient. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The article points out that in the new journey of building a strong country and rejuvenating the nation, auditing bears an important mission. It must be based on the positioning of economic supervision, focus on the main responsibilities and main businesses, and better utilize the unique role of auditing in promoting the party’s self-revolution. effect. To do a good job in the work of the new Central Audit Committee, we must adhere to the guidance of the Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, thoroughly implement the spirit of the 20th National Congress of the Party, fully, accurately and comprehensively implement the new development concept, accelerate the construction of a new development pattern, and strive to promote High-quality development, focusing on overall, long-term and strategic issues, strengthening strategic planning and top-level design in the audit field, and ensuring the overall work of the party and the country with powerful and effective audit supervision services. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The article pointed out that it is necessary to further promote the high-quality development of audit work. To do a good job in auditing in the new era and new journey, the general requirement is to focus on building a centralized, unified, comprehensive, authoritative and efficient audit supervision system and better play the role of audit supervision. Specifically, we must achieve the &quot;three such&quot;. One is to use your fingers like an arm. Audit supervision must be centralized and unified, adhere to and strengthen the centralized and unified leadership of the Party Central Committee on audit work, form a national chess game that is coherent and coordinated from top to bottom within the audit system, enhance the political attributes and political functions of audit, and accurately grasp the intentions and deployment of the Party Central Committee , understand thoroughly and implement well. The second is that they follow each other like a shadow. Audit supervision should be comprehensive, so that audit subjects feel that the audit is always around them like a shadow. In terms of form, all localities, departments and units that manage the use of public funds, state-owned assets and state-owned resources have the right to audit and supervise without exception, forming a normalized and dynamic deterrent; in terms of content, both quality and efficiency are taken into consideration , forming an actual and substantial deterrent. The third is like thunder. Audit supervision must be authoritative and efficient, so that audit supervision can be implemented smoothly, audit results can be used efficiently, and the audit role can be effectively played. On the one hand, we should strengthen our fighting skills and create a &quot;special force&quot; for economic supervision to identify problems accurately, deeply and thoroughly; on the other hand, we should ensure the coordination between audit supervision and other supervision to form a joint force of supervision. The &quot;Sword of Shang Fang&quot; of auditing is awarded by the Party Central Committee. We must be responsible to the Party Central Committee and serve as a sharp weapon for the party and the country. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The article pointed out that we must do a solid job in auditing this year. Adhere to the general tone of the work of seeking progress while maintaining stability, highlight major issues that are obvious in the program, increase audit efforts, and encourage all regions, departments and units to implement and implement the decisions and arrangements of the Party Central Committee. We must focus on the primary task of high-quality development, focus on stabilizing growth, stabilizing employment, and stabilizing prices, focusing on the development of the real economy, focusing on promoting the bottom line of people&#39;s livelihood, focusing on coordinating development and security, and focusing on the standardized operation of power. The “second half of the article” on auditing and rectification is equally important as the “first half of the article” on revealing problems, and must be promoted as one. It is necessary to make good use of audit results and make a good &quot;combination punch&quot; in audit rectification. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The article pointed out that it is necessary to strengthen the construction of audit itself. This year marks the 40th anniversary of the establishment of the audit agency. It is necessary to inherit the glorious tradition and fine style of auditing, shape professional spirit, and improve professional capabilities. It is necessary to comprehensively and strictly manage the party and audit, and build a team of high-quality professional audit cadres that are loyal, clean and responsible. Party committees at all levels must effectively shoulder their political responsibilities and improve their leadership in audit work. The main responsible comrades must personally handle and manage the work, and give full play to the audit committee&#39;s role in taking the lead and overall coordination. &lt;/p>;&lt;!--/enpcontent-->;</description><pubDate> Wed, 01 Nov 2023 06:26:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[01版要闻 - 习近平复信古巴科学家裴德乐]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://paper.people.com.cn/rmrb/html/2023-11/01/nw.D110000renmrb_20231101_4-01.htm]]><description> &lt;div>;Wednesday, November 1, 2023&lt;/div>; &lt;!--enpcontent-->;&lt;P>;Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 31: Recently, President Xi Jinping replied to a letter from the famous Cuban scientist Pedele. &lt;/P>;&lt;P>;Xi Jinping pointed out that you have long been committed to enhancing the special friendly relations between Cuba and China, actively promoted Sino-foreign research cooperation, and achieved many breakthroughs.
