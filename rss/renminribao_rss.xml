&lt;strong>; 夯实农业基础，稳步提升粮食产能&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;保障粮食安全，提升粮食产能是首要任务。甘肃省完善水利基础设施、提升耕地质量，增强农业防灾减灾能力。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“种的是高标准农田，浇的是引洮工程的水，马铃薯长势不错，预计早熟品种亩产3吨，晚熟品种亩产3吨半。”定西市安定区百泉马铃薯种植基地负责人何小谦种了2000多亩马铃薯，这几天忙着防病虫、追水肥。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;有了引洮水，旱塬变粮田。“水渠引来的水先提到1万多立方米的蓄水池里，再通过滴灌带精准输送到根系，土壤不硬化，每亩节水四成以上。”何小谦说。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;粮田还得是良田。“这几年，地块平整了，面积变大了，机耕道修通了，大农机开得进，种地效率高。起垄黑膜覆盖，增墒保温，抑制杂草。安装水肥一体化设施，营养更均衡。”何小谦说。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“陇中十年九旱，用水是关键。我们完善农田水利设施，建成高标准农田25万多亩，推广黑膜覆盖膜侧栽培技术，为马铃薯产业发展提供支撑。”安定区农业技术推广服务中心副主任刘小平介绍。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;农业基础设施加快完善。今年甘肃省水利厅实施调蓄设施、灌区改造等水利项目125个，17座水库（池）建成后将新增供水能力2.6亿立方米，6处大型灌区和19处中型灌区改造项目建成后，将有效改造灌区灌溉面积106.51万亩。今年全省将新建高标准农田265万亩。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;节水农业不断发展，用水效率提高，农业生产更可持续。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“窄膜宽窄行种植技术，种肥同播、水肥一体、精准滴灌，一亩地能节水100多立方米。”金昌市金川区双湾镇营盘村种植大户姚吉文说，“亩均还能增产80至100公斤、增效350元左右。”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;甘肃省耕地亩均水资源量只有全国平均水平的1/4，鼓励使用节水品种、推广节水技术、推进农业水价改革，一系列举措拧紧“水龙头”。全省高效农田节水技术年推广面积稳定在1000万亩以上，其中水肥一体化技术推广面积400万亩以上，水资源利用率持续提高。&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;坚决扛稳粮食安全重任，深入实施“藏粮于地、藏粮于技”战略，稳步提升粮食产能，甘肃奋力实现粮食生产新突破。&lt;/p>;&lt;!--/enpcontent-->;</description><pubDate> Mon, 25 Sep 2023 06:26:09 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[02版要闻 - 持续提升港口能力（实干笃行在一线）]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://paper.people.com.cn/rmrb/html/2023-09/25/nw.D110000renmrb_20230925_2-02.htm]]><description> &lt;div>;2023年09月25日星期一&lt;/div>;
