Have the floor heating pipes been laid?&quot; In the yard, four or five workers were mixing cement. Lu Wencheng pushed up his glasses and looked closely at the progress. &lt;/P>;&lt;P>;&quot;The path is coming.&quot; 63-year-old He Junyun stopped what he was doing and said, &quot;It&#39;s done, we can lay the floor tiles soon.&quot;&lt;/P>;&lt;P>;The Ding family Zhuangcun was severely affected by the heavy rainfall in Zhuozhou this year. The southern area of ​​the village where He Junyun&#39;s home is located is less than 1 kilometer away from the branch of the Beijuma River, and floods flooded into the village. After identification by relevant departments, Dingjiazhuang Village has 29 D-level dilapidated houses and more than 100 C-level dilapidated houses that cannot meet the requirements for normal use, most of which are concentrated in the south of the village. In order to allow the villagers to move into their new houses as soon as possible, Lu Wencheng goes to the south of the village almost every day to keep an eye on the progress of the repairs and coordinate to solve the villagers&#39; needs. &lt;/P>;&lt;P>;After looking at the progress, Lu Wencheng checked inside and out again and confirmed that there were no hidden dangers. Before leaving, he said, &quot;It&#39;s getting cold. If you have any problems, feel free to ask them. The village committee will help solve them.&quot; Then he turned around and walked to the next house to check the situation. &lt;/P>;&lt;P>;Lu Wencheng went door to door to understand the disaster situation and coordinate the reconstruction work. Today, more than 90% of Class C dilapidated buildings in the village have been repaired, and demolition and construction work has begun on Class D dilapidated buildings. &lt;/P>;&lt;P>;Towards noon, Lu Wencheng’s cell phone rang. It was a call from Zhang Aijuan, a big grower in the village: &quot;The wheat that was planted on trial has sprouted.&quot; &quot;I have to go and have a look.&quot; Lu Wencheng said I disconnected the phone and rushed excitedly to the wheat fields in the east of the village. &lt;/P>;&lt;P>;“This year’s soil condition is different from previous years. After watering, the soil is thin and full of bacteria, so wheat planting must be more precise.” The suitable sowing period for wheat is coming soon, and I am worried that watered soil will affect the growth of wheat, Lu Wencheng I came up with the idea of ​​trial planting in advance - asking large growers to plant multiple suitable varieties in small plots first, then apply fertilizer to sterilize and increase fertilizer, and prepare to select the best growing ones for large-scale planting. &lt;/P>;&lt;P>;Walking to the fields to the east of the village, three small experimental fields with an area of ​​about 1 square meter are sprouting with greenery. Lu Wencheng squatted down and recorded his growth with his mobile phone. &quot;These were just planted a few days ago. The seedlings in the middle are dense and green and grow best. You can observe them again.&quot; Lu Wencheng plans to organize a visit with the villagers in a few days. &lt;/P>;&lt;P>;He returned to the village committee and continued to collect statistics on reconstruction data and distribute donated materials... By the time Lu Wencheng returned home, it was already 9 o&#39;clock in the evening. &lt;/P>;&lt;P>;Under the light, several cracks can be seen on the walls of the house, and the food on the table is still steaming. &quot;The damage to our house is relatively minor and we haven&#39;t bothered to repair it yet. We&#39;ll start sorting it out slowly after everything in the village is settled,&quot; said Jia Pengyuan, Lu Wencheng&#39;s wife. &lt;/P>;&lt;P>;During this period, Lu Wencheng and Jia Pengyuan were used to going out early and coming back late every day for recovery and reconstruction. The steaming meals are her support for Lu Wencheng: &quot;The village needs him, and we can&#39;t hold back. I take good care of my family, and he takes care of everyone with peace of mind, and we can complete the reconstruction as soon as possible.&quot;&lt;/P>;&lt;P >;After dinner, Lu Wencheng’s cell phone rang again. There is an open space in the north of the village where post-disaster reconstruction materials from Dongchengfang Town are stored. &quot;Tonight, a batch of steel bars and sand for the reconstruction of dilapidated buildings will arrive. I will go over to check them and put them in storage.&quot; With that, Lu Wencheng walked out of the house quickly. &lt;/P>;&lt;!--/enpcontent-->;</description><pubDate> Thu, 05 Oct 2023 05:26:06 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[02版要闻 - 给家门口的盛会出份力（点赞新时代）]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://paper.people.com.cn/rmrb/html/2023-10/05/nw.D110000renmrb_20231005_2-02.htm]]><description> &lt;div>;Thursday, October 5, 2023&lt;/div>; &lt;!--enpcontent-->;&lt;P>;During the festival, the Hangzhou Asian Games is in full swing. For Miao Yingying, apart from excitement, there is also a different kind of busyness. &lt;/P>;&lt;P>;After lunch on October 3, Miao Yingying changed into city volunteer clothes and a red vest and came to Gongshu Canal Sports Park. Her task today is to provide off-field guidance for hockey games and take charge of social parking spots. &lt;/P>;&lt;P>;There are clear road signs at the points, and Miao Yingying also did her homework early and memorized the directions of travel to different venues. Commanding vehicles, guiding the audience, answering inquiries... During more than three hours of volunteer service, Miao Yingying stood the whole time with a smile on her face. &lt;/P>;&lt;P>;Miao Yingying is a staff member of the Hemu Street Federation of Trade Unions in Gongshu District. During this time, she not only served as a volunteer, but also did a good job in security work in the community. She and her colleagues went to the chemical fiber community in late August to serve 25 buildings and 1,125 households. I walk around communities and streets all day long, taking tens of thousands of steps every day. &quot;Every time I help everyone solve a problem, I feel a special sense of accomplishment.&quot; Miao Yingying said. &lt;/P>;&lt;P>;Looking through work notes, Miao Yingying’s recent work includes safety promotion, safety inspections, neighborly mutual assistance, civilized persuasion, etc. She applied her work experience in the community to the Asian Games protection work and felt that she was also a part of the Hangzhou Asian Games. &lt;/P>;&lt;P>;The sky is getting dark, and the day’s volunteer guidance work is over. Miao Yingying got on her electric bike and hurried home. On both sides of the road, thousands of lights gradually lit up. Under the bright moonlight, the wind along the way blew away the tiredness on her body. &lt;/P>;&lt;P>;As soon as I opened the door, I smelled the familiar aroma of food. The mother, who came all the way from her hometown in Wenzhou to help take care of her children, had already prepared dinner for the family. While eating, she shared her experiences with her mother and children. &lt;/P>;&lt;P>;And Miao Yingying&#39;s lover Xiao Ruiwen is still on duty on the streets of Tonglu. &lt;/P>;&lt;P>;Xiao Ruiwen is the captain of the water division squadron of the Tonglu Traffic Police Brigade of Hangzhou Public Security Bureau. Because the equestrian competition of the Hangzhou Asian Games was held in Tonglu County, Xiao Ruiwen has been on the front line since early August. &lt;/P>;&lt;P>;“We hope to take a tour from the perspective of tourists.” On the other end of the phone, Xiao Ruiwen told reporters that in order to comprehensively improve the road security level around the Asian Games venues, he and his colleagues have visited the venues seven or eight times. Check the surrounding area carefully. Xiao Ruiwen not only has to maintain traffic order outside the venue, but also coordinates horse transportation, duty along the road and other matters, without any carelessness. &lt;/P>;&lt;P>;Due to work, the couple meets no more than 2 days a week, and over time they have formed a tacit understanding. After a while, Xiao Ruiwen finished what he was doing and made another video call. The couple were chatting, and their son, who is in the second grade of junior high school this year, rushed to talk to his father. After hearing this, the younger daughter also came over, and the family laughed and laughed. &lt;/P>;&lt;P>;At the other end of the video, Xiao Ruiwen suggested: &quot;How about we go on a trip as a family when we are done with the work?&quot; Miao Yingying nodded and said, &quot;Don&#39;t worry about being on duty, I will guard the post at home.&quot;&lt;/P>;&lt;P>; P>;&lt;P>;&quot;The Hangzhou Asian Games is a grand event at our doorstep.
