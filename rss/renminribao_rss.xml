The &quot;Opinions&quot; closely focus on the important requirement of &quot;what should be known and what should be done&quot; and innovatively introduce a list system to further promote leading cadres to respect the law, study the law, abide by the law, and use it in a deep and practical way. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The key to government lies in winning people; the key to governing a country lies in people. To comprehensively govern the country according to law, we must seize the &quot;key minority&quot; of leading cadres. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, under the strong leadership of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core, leading cadres at all levels have thoroughly studied and implemented Xi Jinping’s thought on the rule of law, taking the lead in respecting the rule of law, respecting the law, understanding the law, and mastering the law. , abide by the law, defend the rule of law, strictly enforce the rule of law, and act in accordance with the law, drive the whole society to respect the law, learn the law, abide by the law, and use it, and jointly write a new chapter in comprehensively governing the country according to the law. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The report of the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China stated that &quot;leading cadres should play a leading role in demonstration and strive to make respecting the law, learning the law, abiding by the law and using it a common practice in the whole society.&quot; The &quot;Rule of Law in China Construction Plan (2020-2025)&quot; issued by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China )&quot; also clearly requires, &quot;Establish a list of laws and regulations that leading cadres should know and understand, and promote leading cadres to be role models in respecting, studying, abiding by, and using the laws.&quot;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The &quot;Opinions&quot; put forward overall requirements and delineated Focus on learning and clarify work measures. On the new journey, the implementation of the &quot;Opinions&quot; will surely further promote leading cadres at all levels to enhance their concept of the rule of law, improve their ability to think about the rule of law, actively set an example in abiding by party regulations and state laws, and ensure that all tasks of comprehensively governing the country according to law are implemented. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Take the lead in respecting the rule of law, fearing the law, and being a firm believer, active disseminator, and model practitioner of Xi Jinping’s thought on the rule of law&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“Only when you respect the rule of law in your heart, Only in this way can we abide by the law. Only the rule of law that is engraved in people&#39;s hearts is the truly unbreakable rule of law.&quot;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;As early as February 2015, General Secretary Xi Jinping gave a speech to the main leading cadres at the provincial and ministerial levels to study and implement the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China. The opening ceremony of the special seminar on comprehensively promoting the rule of law in the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the CPC Central Committee clearly stated, “Before, we usually talked about learning the law, respecting the law, observing the law, and using it. When preparing this speech, I thought about it repeatedly and felt that respecting the law should be put first. One, because leading cadres must first solve the problem of respecting the law to enhance their awareness of the rule of law and improve their literacy.&quot;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Respecting the rule of law and reverence for the law are the basic qualities that leading cadres must possess. Regarding the legal literacy of leading cadres, we must start to focus on them from the day they enter the cadre ranks, and educate and guide them to buckle the &quot;first button&quot; of the rule of law. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&quot;I swear: to be loyal to the Constitution of the People&#39;s Republic of China, to safeguard the authority of the Constitution, and to perform statutory duties...&quot; Nowadays, it has become normal for state workers to take the constitutional oath when taking office, inspiring and educating state workers to be loyal to the Constitution and abide by the Constitution. The sense of mission and responsibility to uphold the Constitution, safeguard the Constitution, and perform duties in accordance with the law continues to increase. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The Party Constitution is the fundamental law of the Party and the general rules that the entire Party must abide by. Since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, every revision of the Party Constitution embodies the wisdom and efforts of the entire Party, and embodies the Party’s new achievements in theoretical innovation, practical innovation, and institutional innovation. Leading cadres at all levels take the lead in learning the Party Constitution, abiding by the Party Constitution, implementing the Party Constitution, and safeguarding the Party Constitution, keeping in mind the original intention and mission, and tempering strong party spirit. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The law is established above, and the teachings are spread below. In order to further promote leading cadres at all levels to firmly establish awareness of the rule of law, various localities and departments have established and improved a series of systems and mechanisms. For example, through the legal reporting mechanism, the main leaders of local party committees and governments at or above the county level publish a &quot;report card&quot; on the construction of the rule of law every year, and the responsibilities of the person primarily responsible for promoting the construction of the rule of law are continuously consolidated. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The system for the heads of administrative agencies to appear in court to respond to lawsuits is also constantly being improved. It is no longer uncommon for &quot;complainants to appear before officials, appear in court and speak out&quot;. Many heads of administrative agencies who appeared in court to respond to the lawsuit said that this was a profound lesson in the rule of law. When sitting in the dock and facing off against the parties in court, I remind myself to respect the law and abide by the law at all times and everywhere. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;…………&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The authority of the law comes from the inner support and sincere belief of the people. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Xi Jinping’s Thought on the Rule of Law is the latest achievement of adapting Marxist rule of law theory to China and the times. It is the fundamental compliance and action guide for promoting comprehensive rule of law in the new era. Respect the rule of law, revere the law, and the most important thing is to truly learn, understand, believe and apply Xi Jinping’s thought on the rule of law. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core has incorporated comprehensive law-based governance into the &quot;Four Comprehensives&quot; strategic layout, made a series of major decisions, proposed a series of important measures, and led the way to ensure the party&#39;s and national undertakings have made historic achievements and undergone historic changes. This has greatly encouraged leading cadres at all levels to respect and strictly implement the rule of law, and consciously internalize the party&#39;s rules and regulations in their hearts and externalize them in their actions. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“Xi Jinping’s Thought on the Rule of Law is a powerful weapon that has been tested in practice and is rich in practical power.” Xiao Lihui, a professor at the Political and Legal Teaching and Research Department of the Central Party School (National School of Administration), said that the “Opinions” clearly stated that “the study should be mastered by Xi Jinping Rule of law thought as an important required course.&quot; Leading cadres at all levels must deeply understand the decisive significance of the &quot;two establishments&quot;, strengthen the &quot;four consciousnesses&quot;, strengthen the &quot;four self-confidences&quot;, achieve &quot;two safeguards&quot;, continue to work hard to deepen internalization and transformation, and ideologically We should rectify the source, consolidate the foundation and cultivate the talent, build a solid foundation of faith, replenish spiritual calcium, stabilize the rudder of thought, and be a firm believer, active disseminator and model practitioner of Xi Jinping’s thought on the rule of law. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>; &lt;strong>;Take the lead in understanding the law, mastering the law, and laying a solid theoretical foundation and knowledge base for acting in accordance with the law&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, General Secretary Xi Jinping has earnestly warned Leading cadres should be role models in studying the law and take the lead in understanding and mastering the law -&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&quot;Our party and government leading cadres should all become compound cadres and have a basic knowledge system no matter what position they work in.&quot; , the law is a basic component of it.&quot;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&quot;Leading cadres at all levels must especially understand how the law stipulates how we use our power, what we can and cannot do, and cannot be &#39;legally illiterate&#39;. In fact, Party discipline and state laws have clear provisions on many things. If you study and take a look at them carefully, or check and take a look carefully before doing something, you can avoid making mistakes and taking the wrong path.&quot;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;…………&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“Knowledge is the beginning of action, and action is the completion of knowledge.” Nowadays, leading cadres at all levels regard the study of party regulations and state laws as a required course, and strive to keep the mirror of law and discipline in their hearts, hold the ruler of law and discipline tightly in their hands, and know the standards for doing things as officials. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;In practice, various localities and departments continue to improve systems and mechanisms to promote normalization and long-term learning, such as establishing a legal study system for the central group of the Party Committee (Party Group); including learning and mastering intra-party regulations as part of the Party’s Organize the content of &quot;Three Meetings and One Lesson&quot;; incorporate intra-Party regulations and national laws into the teaching content of the Party School (Administrative School) and the required training courses for leading cadres&#39; appointment training and on-the-job training; build online classrooms, produce &quot;micro courses&quot;, and realize &quot;online Combining &quot;online + offline&quot;; holding an examination on the theoretical knowledge of the rule of law for newly appointed leading cadres, and promoting &quot;daily study of the law, annual testing, and promotion testing&quot;...&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Not long ago, the &quot;Hundreds of People&quot; in 2023 A special report meeting for central and state agencies was held in the &quot;Hundred Lectures by Jurists&quot; rule of law propaganda event. The speaker gave a report on the theme of &quot;Improving the Socialist Legal System with Chinese Characteristics with the Constitution as the Core&quot;. It is understood that leading cadres are important targets of the &quot;Double Hundred&quot; campaign. In 2022, more than 86,000 reporting sessions will be held across the country. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;As we embark on a new journey, what should leading cadres at all levels learn, how to learn, and what learning effects should they achieve? The content of the &quot;Opinions&quot; is analyzed piece by piece, and clear requirements are put forward - &lt;/p>;&lt;p>; Study Xi Jinping&#39;s thoughts on the rule of law, and thoroughly and systematically study General Secretary Xi Jinping&#39;s &quot;On Upholding the Comprehensive Rule of Law&quot;, &quot;Excerpts of Xi Jinping&#39;s Essays on Comprehensive Rule of Law&quot;, &quot;Xi Jinping&#39;s Thoughts on the Comprehensive Rule of Law&quot;, &quot;Excerpts of the Treatise on Governing the Party According to Regulations&quot; and study &quot;Xi Jinping&#39;s Outline for Studying the Rule of Law&quot;;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Study intra-party regulations, including conscientiously studying the Party Constitution, the Party&#39;s organizational regulations, the Party&#39;s leadership regulations, the Party&#39;s own construction regulations, The Party&#39;s supervision and guarantee regulations;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Study national laws, including careful study of the Constitution, the overall national security concept and the National Security Law, laws related to promoting high-quality development, the Civil Code, the Criminal Law and the Law on the Administrative Punishment of Public Servants, and the Administrative Law laws and other laws closely related to the performance of duties. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;To conscientiously implement the requirements of the &quot;Opinions&quot;, leading cadres at all levels must deeply understand the decisive significance of &quot;two establishments&quot; and achieve &quot;two maintenances&quot;; firmly establish awareness of the party constitution and more consciously study the party&#39;s laws and regulations, and use the Party Constitution, Party rules and Party disciplines to constrain one&#39;s words and deeds; firmly establish the basic rule of law concepts such as the supremacy of the Constitution and the law, equality before the law, power by law, and power exercise in accordance with the law, so as to think about problems, make decisions, and make decisions under the rule of law. doing something. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>; &lt;strong>;Take the lead in obeying the law, defending the rule of law, and ensuring that power always operates on the track of the rule of law&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The purpose of learning is all about application, &quot;what you should know and what you should know&quot; The key is to &quot;should meet&quot; and to act strictly according to the rules. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;General Secretary Xi Jinping emphasized that &quot;we must exercise power correctly, use power in accordance with the law, use power impartially, and use power with integrity.&quot; &quot;The beliefs, determination, and actions of leading cadres at all levels are of great importance to comprehensively advancing the rule of law.&quot; meaning&quot;. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;In the past, individual leading cadres violated regulations and interfered in judicial activities and disciplinary and law enforcement activities, and chaos such as &quot;relationship cases&quot;, &quot;favor cases&quot; and &quot;money cases&quot; occurred from time to time. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;On March 18, 2015, the &quot;Regulations on Recording, Notification and Accountability of Leading Cadres Intervening in Judicial Activities and Handling Specific Cases&quot; came into effect, clarifying the boundaries and drawing red lines, effectively guiding leaders at all levels to Cadres should be respectful, be wary, and stick to the bottom line. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;In the past, individual leading cadres were keen on &quot;achievement projects&quot; and &quot;face projects,&quot; and the phenomenon of &quot;making decisions with a pat on the head, expressing a position with a pat on the chest, and leaving with a pat on the back&quot; often occurred. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;On September 1, 2019, the &quot;Interim Regulations on Major Administrative Decision-making Procedures&quot; came into effect. All localities strictly implement legal procedures such as public participation, expert argumentation, risk assessment, legality review, and collective discussion and decision-making, and strive to ensure legal and scientific decision-making. &lt;p>; Exercise of power. During this period, a series of typical cases of violations of discipline and law also warned people that no one has the privilege to transcend the constitutional laws. Legal red lines cannot be crossed, and legal bottom lines cannot be touched. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Today, in order to ensure that power always operates on the track of the rule of law, government departments at the three levels of provinces, cities and counties across the country have published lists of powers and responsibilities. Which department has what powers, how many powers, how to use powers correctly and standardize law enforcement... The list of powers and responsibilities is concise, practical and clear at a glance. The concept of &quot;legal responsibilities must be performed, and what cannot be done without the authorization of the law&quot; is taken into mind and is effective in practice. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;To govern the country, we must first govern the party. To govern the party, we must be strict, and to be strict must be in accordance with the law. As important organizers, promoters, and practitioners of comprehensive rule of law, leading cadres must not only abide by the law, but also strictly demand themselves with higher standards in accordance with party rules and disciplines. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;For more than ten years, leading cadres at all levels have always put discipline and rules at the forefront, insisted on making decisions, managing people, and using power in accordance with intra-party laws and regulations, resolutely fighting against all kinds of violations of disciplines and laws, and doing political work. A sensible person who remains loyal, clean and responsible. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The great changes in the atmosphere brought about by the implementation of the eight-point regulations of the Central Committee are a strong confirmation. &quot;Bad habits in the club&quot;, &quot;waste on the tip of the tongue&quot; and &quot;corruption on the wheel&quot; and other phenomena have been resolutely rectified, and the strict tone, strict standards and strict atmosphere have been continuously strengthened. Leading cadres at all levels have awe and fear, consciously resist the &quot;four trends&quot;, keep in mind the spirit of the eight central regulations and their implementation rules, always respect themselves and self-reflect, be cautious in independence, be cautious in beginning, and be more and more accustomed to being under supervision and restraint. work and live in the environment. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&quot;Power is determined by law, and power is exercised in accordance with the law. Leading cadres must establish a correct view of power, establish rules for the exercise of power, and lock power in a cage of systems.&quot; Tianquan County Committee, Ya&#39;an City, Sichuan Province Secretary Yu Li said, &quot;This time the &quot;Opinions&quot; clearly stated &#39;what you should know and what you should do&#39;. This requires us not only to strengthen our study, but also to strictly abide by it, and truly be fearful, speak with caution, and act with restraint. .&quot;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>; &lt;strong>;Take the lead in strictly enforcing the rule of law, acting in accordance with the law, and constantly improving the ability to use legal thinking and legal methods&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&quot;The rule of law is the rule.&quot; Law It is an important tool for governing the country, and the rule of law is an important support for the national governance system and governance capabilities. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;General Secretary Xi Jinping clearly pointed out, “Leading cadres at all levels must improve their ability to use legal thinking and legal methods to deepen reform, promote development, resolve conflicts, and maintain stability, and strive to promote the formation of a system of handling affairs in accordance with the law, finding the law when encountering problems, We must create a good legal environment in which we can rely on the law to solve problems and resolve conflicts, and promote all work on the track of the rule of law.&quot;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, leading cadres at all levels have continuously improved their ability to use legal thinking and legal methods. Strengthen the concept that &quot;all major reforms must be based on the law&quot; and &quot;the rule of law is the best business environment&quot; are deeply rooted in the hearts of the people and put into practice. The construction of China under the rule of law has opened up a new situation, and the role of the rule of law in consolidating the foundation, stabilizing expectations, and benefiting the long-term Continuously manifest. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“To implement the new development concept and realize the shift of the economy from high-speed growth to high-quality development, we must adhere to the rule of law as the guide.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;This year, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council issued the &quot;Integrated Development Plan for the Construction of Digital China&quot; &quot;Layout Plan&quot;, which clearly stated that &quot;improve the legal and regulatory system, strengthen legislative coordination, study and formulate legislative plans in the digital field, and promptly adjust legal systems that are not suitable for digital development in accordance with procedures.&quot;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;For more than ten years. , all localities and departments use legal means to solve difficult and blocking problems in development and ensure the implementation of new development concepts: strengthen the legal protection of the entire chain of intellectual property rights and stimulate the innovation vitality of the whole society; carry out regional coordinated legislation and promote the implementation of regional coordinated development mechanisms Institutionalization and standardization; use the strictest system and strictest rule of law to protect the ecological environment and promote green development; formulate and revise foreign investment laws, foreign trade laws, etc. to inject strong legal impetus into open development; further improve social security policies and systems to effectively Promote common prosperity...&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&quot;The rule of law is an important achievement of human political civilization and a basic means of modern social governance.&quot;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;This year is Comrade Mao Zedong&#39;s instruction to study and promote the &quot;Maple Bridge Experience&quot; The 60th anniversary is the 20th anniversary of General Secretary Xi Jinping’s instructions to uphold and develop the “Maple Bridge Experience”. In the great practice of the new era, the &quot;Maple Bridge Experience&quot; continues to enrich and develop, and one of its distinctive features is that it further highlights the rule of law thinking. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;We pay close attention to outstanding social security issues that are strongly reflected by the masses, and severely crack down on various illegal and criminal activities in accordance with the law; resolve conflicts and disputes in accordance with the law and regulations, resolve reasonable demands with heart and emotion, and successfully resolve a number of backlogged petition cases; standardize law enforcement We must advance solidly in construction, dare to enforce the law, be good at enforcing the law, and strive to achieve the organic unity of legal effects and social effects... By continuously improving the level of legalization of social governance, the broad masses of the people enjoy an increasing sense of gain, happiness, and security. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;…………&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Comprehensively governing the country according to law is a profound revolution in national governance. The report of the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China proposed to comprehensively build a modern socialist country on the track of the rule of law. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“Leading cadres continue to improve their ability to use legal thinking and legal methods. This is a quality and skill that must be possessed on the new journey of comprehensively building a modern socialist country.” Chairman Chen Huanhuan said that in the implementation of the &quot;Opinions&quot;, leading cadres at all levels must &quot;know what they should know and do&quot; with higher standards. They must not only abide by the law and defend the rule of law, but also firmly establish the concept of the rule of law and constantly Improve the ability and level of performing duties in accordance with the law. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Today, in accordance with the requirements of the &quot;Opinions&quot;, various localities and departments are formulating hierarchical and classified lists of intra-party regulations and national laws that leading cadres should know and understand. Incorporate into the cadre education system, establish and improve the incentive mechanism for leading cadres to learn and use the law...A series of measures continue to promote learning to go deeper, to the reality, and to the heart, and the learning results are continuously transformed into the decision-making of leading cadres at all levels in accordance with the law, Conscious action to act in accordance with the law. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;If those who follow the law are strong, the country will be strong. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;On the new journey, leading cadres at all levels will take the lead in being firm believers, active disseminators, and model practitioners of Xi Jinping’s thought on the rule of law. They will take the lead in respecting the rules, learning the rules, abiding by the rules, and taking the lead in respecting the laws, studying the laws, observing the laws, and using them. Encouraging the whole society to abide by laws and know how to use them will surely continue to create a new situation in comprehensively governing the country according to law and contribute greater power of the rule of law to the promotion of Chinese modernization. &lt;/p>;&lt;!--/enpcontent-->;</description><pubDate> Wed, 20 Sep 2023 06:26:05 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[01版要闻 - 中欧班列10年累计开行7.7万列（新数据 新看点）]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://paper.people.com.cn/rmrb/html/2023-09/20/nw.D110000renmrb_20230920_4-01.htm]]><description> &lt;div>;Wednesday, September 20, 2023&lt;/div>; &lt;TABLE width=&quot;100%&quot;>;&lt;TBODY>;&lt;TR>;&lt;TD align=&quot;center&quot;>;&lt;IMG width=&quot;100%&quot; src=&quot;http: //paper.people.com.cn/rmrb/images/2023-09/20/01/rmrb2023092001p19_b.jpg&quot;>;&lt;/TD>;&lt;/TR>; &lt;TR>;&lt;TD>;&lt;p>;Data source: China-Europe Railway Express International Cooperation Forum&lt;BR/>;Drawing: Cai Huawei&lt;/p>;&lt;/TD>;&lt;/TR>;&lt;/TBODY>;&lt;/TABLE>; &lt;!--enpcontent-->;&lt;P>;Lianyungang, September 19th of this newspaper&amp;nbsp ;&amp;nbsp;(Reporters Li Xinping, Bai Guangdi) Reporters recently learned from the China-Europe Railway Express International Cooperation Forum: In the past 10 years, China-Europe freight trains have operated a total of 77,000 trains, transporting 7.31 million TEUs of goods with a value of more than 340 billion U.S. dollars, becoming an international economic and trade important bridge for cooperation. &lt;/P>;&lt;P>;After 10 years of development, China-Europe trains have opened up a new Asia-Europe land transportation channel. Domestically, three main transportation channels have been formed, namely west, middle and east, through Alashankou, Horgos, Erenhot, Manzhouli, Suifenhe and other ports. There are 86 planned China-Europe freight train lines with a speed of 120 kilometers per hour, and China Unicom has 112 cities; outside the country, three major corridors, north, central and south, have been initially formed, connecting 217 cities in 25 European countries and regions, as well as more than 100 cities in 11 Asian countries and regions along the route. &lt;/P>;&lt;P>;After 10 years of development, China-Europe freight trains have opened up a new situation in international transportation cooperation. Compared with sea transportation and air transportation, the transportation price of China-Europe freight trains is 1/5 of air transportation, and the transportation time is 1/4 of sea transportation. It is less affected by the natural environment and has high stability. The average carbon emissions of China-Europe trains are 1/15 of air transport and 1/7 of road transport. They have played an important demonstration role in responding to global climate change and promoting carbon peak and carbon neutrality. &lt;/P>;&lt;P>;After 10 years of development, China-Europe freight trains have brought new opportunities for the development of related industries.

A place that was unknown in the past is now attracting widespread attention due to its rapid development. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;In 2012, Changfeng County was lifted out of poverty; in 2016, it ranked 99th among the top 100 counties in the country in terms of comprehensive strength. Since then, the ranking has continued to rise, rising to 73rd in 2022. &quot;From &#39;poverty&#39; to &#39;Top 100&#39;, Changfeng&#39;s leap-forward development is the fruit of practicing new development concepts.&quot; Changfeng County Party Committee Secretary Li Mingshan said. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“Take innovation as the biggest policy, catch up and catch up.” “The key to achieving leapfrog development lies in innovation.” Bearing in mind General Secretary Xi Jinping’s earnest instructions during his inspection in Anhui, Changfeng’s cadres and masses used innovation to Opened up a new world of development. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;——The innovation of concepts has created a new pattern of county development. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;On the mountains in Gangji Town, Changfeng County, the boundary monument of the &quot;Jianghuai Watershed&quot; stands in between. Changfeng, located in the watershed of the Yangtze River and the Huaihe River, has become one of the few provincial capital cities to have jurisdiction over a key county for national poverty alleviation and development work due to poor soil, drought and little rain. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“Counties should be regarded as an important entry point for the integrated development of urban and rural areas, promote spatial layout, industrial development, infrastructure and other county-level coordination, properly handle the relationship between urban and rural areas, and design and promote them in an integrated manner.” New In this era, General Secretary Xi Jinping’s in-depth thinking and scientific guidance on the county economy have allowed Changfeng to find a way forward. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;With &quot;Two New and One Demonstration&quot;, the Hefei Municipal Party Committee has established a new development positioning for Changfeng County - to create a new highland for the development of Hefei&#39;s advanced manufacturing industry, achieve new breakthroughs in the coordinated development of the entire region, and strive to be the country&#39;s leader in consolidating and expanding poverty alleviation. A model county that effectively connects achievements and rural revitalization. This new positioning has allowed Changfeng to embark on a new path of building a strong county through manufacturing, technological innovation, and agriculture. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Changfeng re-examines its development direction and spatial layout. Changfeng County is in the north and Hefei City is in the south. &quot;Xiangnan proactively integrates into the center of Hefei and promotes integration.&quot; Changfeng decisively adjusted its strategy and scientifically planned its layout. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Open up your mind and lead development breakthroughs. Changfeng adapts measures to local conditions and follows the &quot;trend&quot; of the &quot;market&quot;. Seize the opportunity of Hefei to create a gathering place for emerging industries and vigorously develop the Shuangfeng Economic Development Zone in the south of the county; seize the momentum of the rise of Hefei Binhu New District and design the Beicheng New District of Changfeng County in an integrated manner to improve the quality and function of the city. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“The direction is clear, targeted efforts are made, a blueprint is drawn to the end, and one term is taken after another.

Jiang Xiuzhi, a major strawberry grower in Shuihu Town, is unhurried: &quot;As long as I turn on my mobile phone, I can monitor the growth of strawberries in real time and grasp the temperature, humidity, insect damage, light and other conditions.&quot;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Strawberries are Changfeng&#39;s number one Agricultural brand, the county has a planting area of ​​210,000 acres, more than 80,000 berry farmers, an annual output of about 350,000 tons, and an average annual income of nearly 30,000 yuan per mu. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“Our strawberries, from seed selection to seedling to cultivation, all use modern technology.” Xia Shixiang, president of the Changfeng County Strawberry Association, told us. Since 2018, the county has provided special funds of 20 million yuan to the strawberry industry every year for the introduction and promotion of new varieties and new technologies; in 2020, Changfeng cooperated with Zhongke Hefei Smart Agriculture Valley to develop a digital strawberry big data platform to realize strawberry production Visualization and linkage control of temperature, light, air, soil, fertilizer, and medicine... At present, the output value of the entire &quot;Changfeng Strawberry&quot; industry chain has exceeded 10 billion yuan. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Another &quot;tens of billions&quot; story happened in the new manufacturing industry. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Xiatang Town, located in the middle of the county, is famous for &quot;Xiatang Shaobing&quot;.

&lt;!--enpcontent-->;&lt;P>;“77国集团和中国”峰会日前在古巴首都哈瓦那举行，来自31个国家的国家元首或政府首脑、多名国际和区域组织负责人及116个国家的高级别代表团参加。在这个发展中国家重要的多边合作平台上，中国携手广大发展中国家高举发展旗帜，聚焦协调合作应对当前挑战，发出共同推动全球治理走向更加公平公正的有力声音，释放出全球南方国家团结自强的积极信号。 &lt;/P>;&lt;P>;当今世界正在经历百年未有之大变局，发展中国家力量不断壮大，南南合作为维护发展中国家群体性崛起势头、推动世界经济稳定增长发挥日益重要作用。面对单边主义、霸权主义甚嚣尘上，个别国家大搞单边制裁、脱钩断链，严重损害发展中国家正当发展权益和空间，发展中国家普遍希望加强团结合作，维护发展权利，捍卫公平正义，推动全球治理朝着更加公正合理的方向发展。 &lt;/P>;&lt;P>;峰会通过《哈瓦那宣言》，呼吁全面改革国际金融结构，构建更包容、协调的全球经济治理格局；反对对发展中国家实施单方面制裁。这些充分表明，77国集团和中国践行真正的多边主义，坚定维护国际公平正义，努力提升发展中国家话语权，维护广大发展中国家共同利益，是团结合作、共谋发展的正义力量。联合国秘书长古特雷斯在致辞中说，“77国集团和中国”始终拥护多边主义，在联合国框架下发挥重要作用。 &lt;/P>;&lt;P>;作为世界上最大的发展中国家、“全球南方”的天然成员，中国始终同广大发展中国家同呼吸、共命运。在世界进入动荡变革期、不稳定性不确定性因素增多的背景下，中国致力于携手各方共筑全球南方命运共同体，倡导广大发展中国家坚守独立自主、联合自强的初心，弘扬公道正义、平等包容的精神，践行发展振兴、合作共赢的使命。广大发展中国家共同反对集团对抗和冷战思维，坚持以和平方式解决国家间分歧和争端，才能更好地守护世界和平安宁；广大发展中国家在国际场合积极响亮发声、主持公道，才能不断提升发展中国家在全球治理中的话语权和代表性，更好地维护发展中国家共同利益。 &lt;/P>;&lt;P>;中国始终将南南合作作为对外合作的优先方向，是全球发展事业的坚定推动者和积极贡献者。中国向160多个国家提供发展援助，同150多个国家和30多个国际组织携手共建“一带一路”，同100多个国家和国际组织共同推进全球发展倡议合作，展现负责任大国担当。中国将继续同77国集团成员密切沟通协调，优化发展资源投入，发挥共建“一带一路”倡议等公共产品最大效能，破解发展难题。许多国家与会代表认为，中国积极促进南南合作，为发展中国家实现社会进步、改善人民福祉发挥重要作用。尼加拉瓜总统奥尔特加表示，中国对亚非拉人民的帮助不附加条件，为促进发展中国家的社会进步和人民福祉作出贡献。 &lt;/P>;&lt;P>;习近平主席提出构建人类命运共同体理念和共建“一带一路”倡议、全球发展倡议、全球安全倡议、全球文明倡议，为维护和平、推动发展、深化合作提供中国方案，为深化南南合作搭建重要实践平台。 《哈瓦那宣言》纳入多项中国理念和主张，明确指出有关各方应在共商、共建、共享基础上致力于实现全球发展和共赢合作，推动构建人类命运共同体。这再次表明，中国方案符合时代潮流，顺应广大发展中国家谋发展、促合作的共同期待。古巴国家主席迪亚斯—卡内尔指出，全球发展倡议具有重要意义和价值，这一包容性倡议顺应了建立新的公平公正国际秩序的时代潮流。吉布提总理卡米勒表示，发展中国家应探索相关机制和举措促进本国生产和科技进步，从而推动可持续发展，中国提出的全球发展倡议正与此相契合。 &lt;/P>;&lt;P>;中国坚定站在历史正确一边，坚定奉行“大道之行，天下为公”。无论发展到什么程度，中国都将永远是发展中国家大家庭的一员，永远是全球南方国家的一员。无论国际风云如何变幻，中国都将始终做广大发展中国家的真诚朋友和可靠伙伴，始终做77国集团的坚定支持者和同路人，致力于实现共同发展振兴，开创人类社会更加美好的明天。 &lt;/P>;&lt;!--/enpcontent-->;
