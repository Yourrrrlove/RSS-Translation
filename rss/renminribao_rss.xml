Since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, he has traveled to 9 provinces and regions in the upper, middle and lower reaches of the Yellow River. Wherever he looks and stops and thinks, he is all about the mother river. Foresight for the future. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“Let the Yellow River become a happy river that benefits the people.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;With sincere words and sincere emotions, the Nine-Meander Yellow River stirs up a more powerful symphony of the new era. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;The governance of the great river——&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;“The history of the Chinese nation’s governance of the Yellow River is also a history of country governance”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On September 17, 2019, Zhengzhou, Henan, the Yellow River Museum&#39;s &quot;River Management for Thousands of Years&quot; exhibition hall. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;General Secretary Xi Jinping stared for a long time in front of a historical map of the Yellow River diversion. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The area of ​​the overflow reaches Tianjin in the north and Jianghuai in the south, spanning 250,000 square kilometers. The swaying streamlines are like whips whipping towards the earth, bringing suffering to the people. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The Yellow River is not only the mother river and life river of the Chinese nation, but also a rebellious and troubled river. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Once upon a time, the Yellow River had &quot;many silts, many overflows, and many migrations&quot;, &quot;it burst twice every three years, and changed its course once every hundred years.&quot; In the more than 2,500 years before the founding of the People&#39;s Republic of China, there were more than 1,500 overflows in the lower reaches, and the course was changed. 26 times. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“When the Yellow River is peaceful, the world is at peace.” “In a sense, the history of the Chinese nation’s governance of the Yellow River is also a history of governing the country.” Thinking about thousands of years, the General Secretary has deeply thought about governing the Yellow River and governing the country. Relationship. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;For thousands of years, Chinese people have prayed for the safety of the Yellow River. After the founding of New China, history placed the important task of controlling Huang in the hands of the Chinese Communists. According to statistics, since the founding of the People&#39;s Republic of China, the Yellow River has survived the autumn floods for more than 70 years and has been flowing continuously for 24 years. It has withstood 12 major floods and created a miracle of &quot;hanging river above the ground&quot; management. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“Practice has proved that only under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and giving full play to the advantages of the socialist system can we truly realize the historic transformation of Yellow River governance from passive to active and fundamentally change the tragic situation of the Yellow River bursting every three years. .&quot; General Secretary Xi Jinping said. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Arriving at the Yellow River National Geopark, General Secretary Xi Jinping walked along the bank of the Yellow River to inspect the surrounding environment. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Leaning on the railing and looking into the distance, you can see the sky is high and the water is wide, and the birds are flying in the dense forest. In the mind of the General Secretary, he has a grand blueprint for the safety of the Yellow River. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Water is the greatest of the five evils. Well aware of the importance and difficulty of water control, General Secretary Xi Jinping once pointed out: &quot;In the history of our five thousand years of Chinese civilization, some places have prospered and declined several times. Many rises and declines in history have happened in succession. If you want the country to be peaceful and the people to be safe and prosperous, you must be good at water control.&quot;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The Yellow River is undoubtedly the top priority for water control. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&quot;Everyone is very busy on the eve of National Day. No matter how busy we are, we still need to arrange time to study the Yellow River issue seriously. The Party Central Committee attaches great importance to this issue.&quot; The second day of the symposium on ecological protection and high-quality development in the Yellow River Basin At the meeting, General Secretary Xi Jinping made a clear statement. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&quot;We all call the Yellow River the mother river. Protecting the Yellow River is a long-term plan related to the great rejuvenation and sustainable development of the Chinese nation.&quot; The words of the General Secretary fully explained the importance of the Yellow River to the survival of the Chinese nation. development significance. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“The Yellow River has less water and more sediment, and the uncoordinated relationship between water and sediment is the crux of the Yellow River’s complexity and difficulty.” “Although the Yellow River has not had major problems for many years, the hidden danger of water damage in the Yellow River is still like a sharp sword. Hanging over our heads, we cannot relax our vigilance at all.&quot;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;With such a sense of urgency, General Secretary Xi Jinping has visited the front line of the Yellow River many times to inspect the flood situation. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Dongying, Shandong Province, the mouth of the Yellow River. On October 20, 2021, General Secretary Xi Jinping came here. At that time, the autumn floods of the Yellow River had returned to the main river channel, but the &quot;crossing&quot; traces of more than 10 meters from the main river channel to the green belt of the dock were still clearly visible. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;As soon as he got off the car, the General Secretary asked where the water edge was when the water level was the highest some time ago. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&quot;This is the waterside line when the floodplain flooded on October 8.&quot; On the dock, the person in charge of the Yellow River Estuary Management Bureau held an exhibition board and reported to the General Secretary one by one. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The wind and waves were high at the pier, and the General Secretary stretched out his hand to help support the swaying display board, inspected it carefully, and interjected questions from time to time. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;When he heard that although the autumn floods on the Yellow River were &quot;severe and dangerous,&quot; there were no major losses or casualties, the General Secretary nodded in affirmation. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&quot;When I came here today, I have reached the upper, middle and lower reaches of the Yellow River, and I feel at ease.&quot; General Secretary Xi Jinping said. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;At the symposium two days later, the General Secretary once again talked to the comrades in charge of the Yellow River control about the original mission of the river control: to do a good job in the affairs of the Yellow River. &quot;This was also Chairman Mao&#39;s long-cherished wish back then.&quot; &quot;Now we&#39;re going to do it.&quot; &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&quot;We cannot be satisfied with the results we have achieved. We must adhere to a problem-oriented approach, make persistent efforts, and do a good job in all tasks unswervingly.&quot; The general secretary said sincerely. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;There is a vast &quot;beach area&quot; in the lower reaches of the Yellow River. The beach area between the main river channel and the flood control embankment is an important area for the Yellow River to carry out floods, detain floods, and settle sediment. It is also the place where people in the beach area live and produce. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&quot;After the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, I have been concerned about the relocation and reconstruction of the Yellow River floodplain area. It is a great thing to carry out comprehensive relocation and reconstruction.&quot; In Yangmiao Community, Kenli District, Dongying, Shandong, the general manager The secretary met the people in the Yellow River beach area whom he had always cared about. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“Three years to save money, three years to build a platform, three years to build a house, and three years to pay off debts” was a true portrayal of the housing difficulties of the people in the beach area. Today, in the Yangmiao community, rows of buildings and roads are neatly intertwined, and modern convenience service facilities are complete, confirming the dramatic changes in the &quot;poor den&quot; of the past. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;On the Yellow River dam, listen to history and see changes; in the restaurant for the elderly, lift the lid of the pot and talk about everyday things; in the homes of residents, ask about changes and listen to the voices of the people...Walking and watching and asking questions, the General Secretary A stone fell in my heart, &quot;I am very happy to see you living and working in peace and contentment.&quot;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&quot;What does the Communist Party do? It serves the people and seeks rejuvenation for the Chinese nation, so we must continue to Let’s look at what things need to be done well and what things must be done at an accelerated pace. Managing the Yellow River is one of the major things.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;This is the party’s commitment to the people and the leader’s deep feelings for the people. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;On the occasion of the arrival of 2022, General Secretary Xi Jinping delivered a New Year’s message. He said: &quot;In recent years, I have traveled to 9 provinces and regions in the upper, middle and lower reaches of the Yellow River. Whether it is the &#39;Mother River&#39; of the Yellow River and the Yangtze River, the rippling Qinghai Lake, the majestic Yarlung Zangbo River; whether it is the South-to-North Water Diversion Project of the Century, or the Seoul The &#39;green map&#39; of Hanba Forest Farm; whether it&#39;s Yunnan elephants traveling north and returning to the south, or Tibetan antelopes breeding and migrating... these all show that people will live up to the green mountains, and the green mountains will definitely live up to people.&quot;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Warmth His words are powerful and inspiring. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;The beauty of the river - &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;“Work together to achieve great protection and coordinate to promote great governance”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p >; &quot;I once said that the Yangtze River is sick, and the disease is not serious. Today I want to say that the Yellow River has always been weak and sick, with frequent flooding.&quot; General Secretary Xi Jinping is worried about the &quot;health&quot; of the mother river. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The disease of the Yellow River is caused by both the objective constraints of congenital deficiencies and the human factors of acquired malnutrition -&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Among the major river basins in the country, the Yellow River basin has the largest proportion of soil and water loss area in the basin land area. ; The ecology of the upper, middle and lower reaches is prone to degradation, and recovery is extremely difficult and the process is slow; pollution emission intensity is high in some areas. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Ecological issues test historical perspective. Standing at the height of the sustainable development of the Chinese nation, General Secretary Xi Jinping set the tone for ecological protection and high-quality development in the Yellow River Basin - &quot;jointly carry out major protection and coordinate to promote major governance.&quot; &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Overall pulse checking and systematic prescription. Coordinating the upstream and downstream, main branches, tributaries, and left and right banks, the General Secretary requested that the Yellow River ecosystem be planned as an organic whole: the upstream should focus on improving water source conservation capabilities; the midstream should focus on soil and water conservation and pollution control; the downstream should focus on protecting wetland ecology system to enhance biodiversity. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;In August 2016, General Secretary Xi Jinping visited Qinghai. Departing from Beijing, the plane headed west, passing through the North China Plain, crossing the Taihang Mountains, crossing the Loess Plateau, and arriving at the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Outside the porthole, the water of the Yellow River surges all the way. The complex and changeable topography on both sides tells people that the ecological protection and management of the Yellow River Basin is extremely difficult. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Qinghai sits at the source of the Yangtze River, Yellow River, and Lancang River. The clean water output from here every year accounts for about half of the entire Yellow River basin. In the General Secretary&#39;s mind, Qinghai&#39;s ecology is like crystal, precious and fragile. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;In the Qalhan Salt Lake, learn about the development of circular economy in Qaidam; in the clean energy company, inspect the solar cell production line; in the Provincial Ecological Environment Monitoring Center, observe the source of the Yellow River in Eling Lake-Zha through remote video Real-time monitoring of Linghu and other points...During the inspection, General Secretary Xi Jinping was very concerned about Qinghai&#39;s ecological protection issues. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The General Secretary made a clear request: &quot;Qinghai&#39;s greatest value lies in ecology, its greatest responsibility lies in ecology, and its greatest potential lies in ecology. The construction of ecological civilization must be placed in a prominent position.&quot; &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;At a symposium, when it came to protecting the &quot;Chinese Water Tower&quot;, the General Secretary proposed: Is it important to think about the GDP here or the green waters and green mountains? As a water conservation area, it is responsible for maximizing ecological functions, rather than deciding to build a factory, open a mine, and generate some GDP to live by yourself. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;From the &quot;Chinese Water Tower&quot; Sanjiangyuan in the upper reaches, to the &quot;Central Water Tower&quot; Qinling Mountains and &quot;North China Water Tower&quot; Shanxi in the middle reaches... Mountains are one step away, and water is one step away. The General Secretary is concerned about &quot;the great man of the country&quot; . &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“Your place is the North China Water Tower, a water conservation area in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, an important part of the Three-North Shelter Forest, and an important barrier to protect the ecological security of the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region and the Yellow River.” May 2020, General Secretary Xi Jinping emphasized this during his inspection in Shanxi. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The Fenhe River, the second largest tributary of the Yellow River, gave birth to the splendid culture of the Three Jin Dynasties. Due to over-development in the basin, the ecology of Fenhe River has been greatly damaged and the water quality has been seriously polluted. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;General Secretary Xi Jinping requested: “We must attach great importance to the ecological and environmental protection of the Fen River, so that the mother river of Shanxi will have abundant water, good water quality, and beautiful scenery.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p >;This time when he came to Shanxi, the General Secretary made a special trip to the bank of the Fen River to take a look. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Local comrades reported that Taiyuan City has adopted measures such as comprehensive management of the Fen River and &quot;Nine Rivers&quot; and ecological restoration of the watershed. The water quality of the Fen River has gradually improved, and the green belts on both sides have become a place for citizens to relax and entertain. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The General Secretary nodded frequently: &quot;What a great change! Taiyuan has had the reputation of &#39;Splendid Taiyuan City, surrounded by mountains on three sides and divided by water&#39; since ancient times. Now the beautiful scenery of Splendid Taiyuan is becoming a reality.&quot;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>; p>;&lt;p>;“We must effectively protect and manage the Fen River, reproduce the beauty of the late Yangfen River crossing in Kuching, and let a clear water flow into the Yellow River.” The general secretary emphasized to local leading cadres. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Looking north from the entrance of the Fen River to Huangkou, the Yellow River splits the Shanxi-Shaanxi Gorge, and the Loess Plateau on both sides is rolling. This is an important source of sediment for the Yellow River. Today, greenery is lighting up this yellow land. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;In the golden autumn of 2022, the apple orchard in Nangou Village, Gaoqiao Town, Ansai District, Yan&#39;an City, Shaanxi Province, was enjoying a bumper harvest. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;General Secretary Xi Jinping walked into the orchard, had cordial exchanges with fellow villagers, and picked a big red apple. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Yan&#39;an was once one of the areas with the most severe soil erosion in my country. Nowadays, with the continuous advancement of measures to control water and soil erosion such as returning farmland to forests and planting trees, the once ravines and maomaos have become shade trees and forests. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The general secretary once joined a team in northern Shaanxi. Recalling his days as an educated youth, he said that in the past, fellow villagers in northern Shaanxi built terraced fields and planted crops. They faced the loess and turned their backs to the sky. Nowadays, apples are planted on the hillsides after returning farmland to forests. The villagers have jobs and stable incomes, their children have good education, and the elderly have medical insurance. Their lives are getting better and better. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Think of what you do. From the source of the Three Rivers to the shores of the Bohai Sea, General Secretary Xi Jinping is full of concern wherever he goes and where his heart is. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;In October 2021, at the mouth of the Yellow River, the General Secretary walked into the depths of the wetland along the wooden plank road and observed this paradise of animals and plants - in autumn, the sea breeze blew, the reeds swayed, and several Swan geese and bar-headed geese inhabit small islands in the water. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The local responsible comrades said that in recent years, through returning farmland to wetland and returning land to beach, we have promoted wetland restoration and the ecological environment has become better and better. &quot;We are the hometown of China&#39;s Oriental White Stork and a breeding ground for black-billed gulls. Since last year, flamingos, white pelicans and spoon-billed sandpipers have been newly discovered.&quot;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&quot;Many tourists come here. &quot;?&quot; asked the General Secretary. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“At the peak, the annual number of tourists was 600,000. We have limited the maximum number of tourists per day.” The local person in charge replied. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The General Secretary warned: &quot;We must manage it well. Wetlands must not be polluted, and we must not hunt or set up nets to catch birds.&quot;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Now, the country&#39;s first land and sea coordination system is being created here. National Park, a series of ecological protection and restoration projects have been promoted, and the Damei Wetland is full of vitality. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“We must not do anything that is not conducive to the ecological protection of the Yellow River Basin.” The general secretary’s request was inspiring. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Upstream protection, midstream management, and downstream restoration. Following the guidance of General Secretary Xi Jinping, various localities have taken protection as the red line to &quot;treat&quot; the Yellow River, and the mother river has gradually regained its vitality. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;The importance of the river——&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;“Promote the high-quality development of the Yellow River Basin and create the Yellow River Cantata in the new era”&lt;/strong>;&lt; /p>;&lt;p>;“The seven provinces and autonomous regions in the upper and middle reaches of the Yellow River are underdeveloped areas. Compared with the eastern region and the Yangtze River Basin, there is a significant gap. The pace of transformation and upgrading of traditional industries lags behind, and the endogenous power is insufficient...&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Faced with the difficulties and problems existing in the high-quality development of the Yellow River Basin, General Secretary Xi Jinping once made such a profound analysis. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Develop first or protect first? Control supply or demand? Looking for a place or a river basin? To promote high-quality development and face more contradictions and entanglements in the Yellow River Basin, we need to have a foresighted mind and vision. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;From the source of the Sanjiang River to the estuary, from the &quot;Symposium on Ecological Protection and High-Quality Development in the Yellow River Basin&quot; to the &quot;Symposium on Deeply Promoting Ecological Protection and High-Quality Development in the Yellow River Basin&quot;, General Secretary Xi Jinping investigated and thought along the way. Solving problems along the way sets the tone. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;To promote high-quality development in the Yellow River Basin, it is necessary to clarify the relationship between development and protection. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;North Bank of the Yellow River, Yuncheng, Shanxi. The colorful Salt Lake witnesses the industrial transformation of the &quot;City of Salt Transport&quot;. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;On May 16, 2023, next to the Yuncheng Salt Lake, the white Hedong salt was placed on the exhibition stand. General Secretary Xi Jinping listened to relevant briefings based on display boards and exhibits, and inspected the Salt Lake on the spot. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;With more than 4,600 years of salt mining history and 70 years of inorganic salt development history - Yuncheng has prospered because of salt, but it also faces the dilemma of over-exploitation, obsolete industries and increased pollution due to long-term resource dependence. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&quot;Adhering to ecological priority and green development&quot;, with the implementation of the national strategy of ecological protection and high-quality development in the Yellow River Basin, Yuncheng is facing transformation opportunities. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Return the salt to the lake, vacate the cage and replace the bird! &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Starting from 2020, all industrial production will be stopped within the protection scope of the Salt Lake, and the Salt Lake will begin to transform from a mining area and industrial area into an ecological protection zone and a tourist check-in place. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;At the same time, Yuncheng is accelerating the cultivation and expansion of emerging industrial clusters such as automotive equipment manufacturing, new materials, green building materials, electronic information, food and medicine, and taking advantage of its location advantages to create a new highland for the opening up of inland areas. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;General Secretary Xi Jinping pointed out the development direction of the provinces and regions along the Yellow River: All provinces and regions in the Yellow River basin must insist on protecting the ecology of the Yellow River basin as the baseline for planning development and promoting high-quality development. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;To promote high-quality development in the Yellow River Basin, we must balance the relationship between supply and demand. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Nanyang, Henan Province, spans the three major river basins of the Yellow River, Yangtze River and Huaihe River, and is the location of the &quot;faucet&quot; and &quot;master switch&quot; of the first phase of the middle route of the South-to-North Water Diversion Project. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“I have always wanted to come to this place.” On May 13, 2021, the first phase of the central line project started. General Secretary Xi Jinping stood on the bow of the ship and spoke with concern, &quot;I have been paying attention to the construction of the South-to-North Water Diversion Project, the operation of this place and the immigration work here. I am very happy to take a look at it this time.&quot;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Water, The source of life and necessary for production. The spatiotemporal distribution of water resources in my country is extremely uneven, with summer floods and winter dryness, and the north is short of abundant and the south is abundant. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;At the symposium held later, General Secretary Xi Jinping pointed out: &quot;Entering a new stage of development, implementing new development concepts, building a new development pattern, forming a unified national market and a smooth domestic circulation, promoting north-south The coordinated development of both sides requires strong support from water resources.&quot;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;In one statement, water resources were placed at a strategic level related to national development. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The total amount of water resources in the Yellow River Basin is only 7% of that of the Yangtze River, but it is responsible for the water supply of 12% of the country’s population, 17% of its cultivated land, and more than 50 large and medium-sized cities. The contradiction between supply and demand is even more prominent. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;What’s the solution to the problem? &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;General Secretary Xi Jinping has a firm tone: we insist on using water to determine cities, water to determine land, water to determine people, and water to determine production. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;This is a battle for deep water conservation and water control: promoting water-saving irrigation, developing dry farming, carrying out water conservation in livestock and fisheries, strengthening the use of recycled water, and promoting the use of rainwater...&lt;/p>;&lt;p>; This is a strict rigid constraint: establish a zoning management and control system for water resources carrying capacity, limit the scale of urban development, the construction of high water consumption projects and large-scale tree planting in areas with severe water shortages, and establish a total water withdrawal control system covering the entire basin. ...&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The entire Yellow River Basin took action, and the simple truth of &quot;there are as many steamed buns as there are soups to soak in&quot; was deeply rooted in the hearts of the people. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;To promote high-quality development in the Yellow River Basin, we must coordinate the relationship between the whole and the parts. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The Ningxia Plain is benefited from irrigation by the Yellow River and has been known as the &quot;fortress to the south of the Yangtze River&quot; since ancient times. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;On June 9, 2020, at the Daoyu Space Rural Ecological Sightseeing Park in Helan County, Yinchuan City, General Secretary Xi Jinping climbed up to the observation tower and overlooked the entire park; he walked into the rice fields along the ridges and watched the The working villagers chatted cordially; scooped up fish fry and crab seedlings and put them into the canals beside the fields...&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Here, the General Secretary emphasized that we should pay attention to solving the rice-water conflict, adopt water-saving technologies, and actively develop water-saving technologies. Water-based, high-value-added farming industry protects the water resources of the Yellow River. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&quot;Strive to build a pioneering area for ecological protection and high-quality development in the Yellow River Basin.&quot; During that trip to Ningxia, General Secretary Xi Jinping put forward ardent expectations for Ningxia. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Being first is not only an encouragement to dare to venture and try, but also a positioning to consider deeply. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Require Sanjiangyuan, Qilian Mountain and other regions to &quot;create more ecological products&quot;, instruct major grain-producing areas such as the Hetao Irrigation District and Fenwei Plain to &quot;contribute to ensuring national food security&quot;, and instruct regional central cities and other economies Areas with good development conditions &quot;increase the economic and population carrying capacity&quot;...&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;From the overall perspective, General Secretary Xi Jinping accurately planned the development positioning of provinces and regions along the Yellow River, and guided the areas along the Yellow River to firmly establish a &quot;game of chess&quot; Thoughts, playing the Yellow River Cantata in the new era. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;To promote high-quality development in the Yellow River Basin, we must plan for current and long-term relationships. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&quot;The man who opened the canal will leave his name throughout the ages and history!&quot;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;On June 6, 2023, General Secretary Xi Jinping came to another agricultural land beside the Yellow River ——Bayannur, Inner Mongolia, stopped for a long time in front of the sand table at the Water Quantity Information Monitoring Center of the Hetao Irrigation District. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Since the founding of the People&#39;s Republic of China, decades of water conservancy construction have carved a seven-level irrigation and drainage system on the Hetao Plain that spreads like human blood vessels, with a total length of 64,000 kilometers, equivalent to a circle around the Earth&#39;s equator. Half. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The General Secretary was full of praise for this irrigation system: &quot;It will be left as a century-old and millennium foundation in the future.&quot;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The next day, General Secretary Xi Jinping listened to the local Introduction to developing new energy and new material industries, promoting optimization and adjustment of industrial structure, and promoting green and low-carbon development. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&quot;What are the plans next?&quot; the general secretary asked. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The local comrade responsible for the development of the energy industry reported: &quot;It is expected that by 2025, Inner Mongolia&#39;s new energy installed capacity and power generation will more than double that of 2022, and the external electricity will more than quadruple.&quot;&lt;/p >;&lt;p>;General Secretary Xi Jinping warned: &quot;Inner Mongolia&#39;s energy industry has long been dominated by coal and was born out of coal. However, the industry is too single and diversified development is the direction. Energy construction cannot rely solely on traditional industries, but must vigorously develop new energy , clean energy, strive to achieve carbon peak and carbon neutrality, and build a green China.”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;From the irrigation canal in front of us, we can see the millennium-old foundation; from the new energy industry, we can see the prospects of green China. General Secretary Xi Jinping We are concerned about the current Yellow River and also planning the future of the basin. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“Promoting ecological protection and high-quality development in the Yellow River Basin cannot be accomplished in a day.” To properly handle the relationship between the present and the future, General Secretary Xi Jinping earnestly warned—&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“We must maintain Historical patience and strategic determination, success does not have to be in my spiritual realm and success must have my historical responsibility. I must not only plan for the long term, but also work in the present, draw a blueprint to the end, and work on it one step at a time. Let the Yellow River benefit the people.&quot;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;The Soul of the River——&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;&quot;The Yellow River culture is an important part of Chinese civilization and the foundation of the Chinese nation. Roots and Souls&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;On January 26, 2022, the twenty-fourth day of the twelfth lunar month, auspicious snow fell on both sides of the Fenhe River and was covered in silver.

What new changes will the new mechanism bring? The reporter was informed that the difference between the new mechanism and the previous PPP policy was mainly three aspects: focusing on user payment projects, priority to choose private enterprises to participate, and all adopted a franchise model. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; Focus on user payment items &lt;/strong>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; It can form a stable cash flow expectation, prevent new local hidden debt from the source &lt;/strong >; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; According to the &quot;Opinions&quot;, the PPP project should focus on the user&#39;s payment project, clarify the charging channels and methods, the project operating income can cover the construction investment and operating costs, and have a certain return on investment.

Earlier, some government -based paid PPP projects were insufficient in PPP projects or even lacking sources of benefits. The government promised to make up for a fixed return or guarantee the minimum income in the direction, and locks in advance and solidify the government&#39;s future expenditure responsibilities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Li Zezheng, deputy director of the financing room of the Investment Research Institute of the National Development and Reform Commission, said that the new mechanism emphasizes &quot;focusing on user payment projects&quot;, requiring the project&#39;s operating income to cover the construction investment and operating costs, and have a certain return on investment. The source is to prevent new local hidden debt. Wang Yingying, assistant researcher at Tsinghua University Investment and Financing Policy Research Center, believes that projects with the basis of user paid usually meet the actual needs of the public, and can form a stable cash flow expectation. Focusing on these projects, it is conducive to squeezing out of excessive advancement or relative lag. s project. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The &quot;Opinions&quot; proposes that under the premise of strictly prevent the hidden debt of the new local government, meet the requirements of laws and regulations and relevant policies, give government investment support to the government&#39;s payment projects during the project construction period; The government&#39;s payment can only be allowed to operate in accordance with regulations, and the cost of construction cannot be subsidized. In addition, it is not allowed to use fiscal funds to make up for project construction and operating costs through any methods such as feasibility gap, commitment to guarantee the bottom, and available payment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;The new mechanism does not completely exclude government investment support and government payment, but strictly limits government expenditure conditions.&quot; Xu Chengbin, deputy director of the Research Center of China International Engineering Consulting Co., Ltd., said that according to the new mechanism, government investment, government investment The support is mainly due to the project construction period. It can be implemented through the form of government capital injection or construction investment subsidies. If it involves government capital injection, it should be included in the management of government investment projects in accordance with the requirements of the &quot;Government Investment Regulations&quot;; government payment is in project operations in the project operation During the period, &quot;subsidy operations in accordance with regulations&quot; usually use unified operation subsidy standards stipulated in industry or regional regulations, which are not directly related to whether the project adopts the PPP model, and will not add government expenditure responsibilities because of the PPP model. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; Preferential choice of private enterprise participation &lt;/strong>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; adhere to the original intention and return to the source >; &lt;p>; Industry experts said that in the PPP projects implemented in the past, many central enterprises and local state -owned enterprises participated in the role of social capital. Although they played a positive role, they had a certain degree of crowding effect on private investment. The &quot;Opinions&quot; proposes that we must adhere to the original intention and return to the origin, and to the greatest extent encourage private enterprises to participate in the new (including the reform and expansion) project. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;The new mechanism clarifies the participation of private enterprises first.&quot; The relevant person in charge of the Investment Department of the National Development and Reform Commission stated that the &quot;Opinions&quot; proposed to maximize the involvement of private enterprises to participate in the new (including reform and expansion) project, and And according to the strong and weak public attributes of different projects, the newly built (including reform and expansion) projects of PPP is divided into three categories. At the same time, the list of &quot;new construction (including reform and expansion) project (2023)&quot; (2023 version) &quot; &quot;List&quot;). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Xu Chengbin said that the &quot;List&quot; implements classification management: First, projects with higher marketization and weak public attributes, such as garbage solid waste treatment and waste incineration power generation projects, shall be wholly or ordered by private enterprises. Holdings; second, projects with strong national economy and people&#39;s livelihood and strong public attributes, such as urban water supply, gas supply, and heating projects. In principle, the proportion of private enterprises is not less than 35%; the third is projects with strong national security and public attributes. If large and medium -sized water conservancy projects with power generation functions should actively create conditions and support private enterprises to participate. &quot;The investment scale, public welfare attributes, and difficulties of construction in three types of projects have gradually improved, and the proportion of private equity participation has generally decreased. However, the second and third types of projects do not rule out the capable of wholly -owned or controlled private enterprises.&quot; Xu Chengbin said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The Opinions also make it clear that for PPP projects outside the fields listed in the List, they can also actively encourage private enterprises to participate; foreign investment companies participate in the PPP project, in accordance with the relevant requirements of foreign investment management and refer to relevant regulations with relevant regulations implement. The National Development and Reform Commission will timely collect and organize opinions and suggestions in the implementation of the list in all aspects, and conduct dynamic adjustments to the project list based on the new situation and new requirements of investment management. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The relevant person in charge of the Investment Department of the National Development and Reform Commission said that the new mechanism will extend the passage of the franchise to 40 years, and the projects with a large investment scale and a long return cycle can also be appropriately extended to clearly strengthen management and reduce costs to reduce costs. The additional income obtained by improving efficiency and active innovation is mainly owned by the operator, which helps to enhance the enthusiasm of private capital to participate in projects. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; All adopt a franchise mode &lt;/strong>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; Risk -controllable and strict supervision. P>; &lt;p>; &quot;Opinions&quot; proposes that all PPPs should be implemented in a franchise model, and in the contract clearly stipulates that the asset rights during the construction and operation period are clearly defined, and the relationship between the rights and responsibilities of all parties is clearly defined. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Experts interviewed believe that the risk of franchise mode is controllable, strict supervision, and clear investment returns. The new mechanism proposes that the PPP projects should be implemented in the franchise model, which is conducive to the formation of a better policy and market environment , Prevent irregular models and potential risks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In order to standardize the implementation of the construction and implementation, the Opinions strictly review the special operating plan, fair selection of franchisees, regulate the signing of franchise agreements, strictly perform investment management procedures, do a good job of project construction implementation and other aspects. A series of measures. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;In order to choose a franchise operator fair, the new mechanism clearly uses the project operation plan, charging unit price, and franchise period as an important evaluation standard for selecting franchisees, and pay attention to project operation management experience, professional operation capabilities, professional operation capabilities 2. Comprehensive strength and credit rating of the enterprise. &quot;Xu Chengbin said that these open competition conditions are no longer emphasizing financing and construction capabilities like before, which is conducive to excellent private enterprises to stand out. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; According to the &quot;Opinions&quot;, the PPP project that has not completed the bidding procurement before the cleanup and verification of the PPP project in February 2023 shall be implemented in accordance with the new mechanism. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The relevant person in charge of the Investment Department of the National Development and Reform Commission said that local governments at all levels must regulate the promotion of franchise projects within the scope of government rights at the same level, clarify the implementation agencies of franchise projects in accordance with laws and regulations, and effectively bear the main body. Responsibility; social capital side and consulting agency must comprehensively and accurately understand the connotation of the new mechanism, and promote specific projects objectively and reasonably from a professional perspective. &lt;/p>; &lt;!-/enpcontent->; &lt;br>; &lt;hr>; &lt;div>; Get more RSS: &lt;br>; &lt;a href = &quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style = &quot;color: orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.run&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https:// feedx.run&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 27 Nov 2023 05:56:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[02版要闻 - 习近平的黄河情怀]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://paper.people.com.cn/rmrb/html/2023-11/27/nw.D110000renmrb_20231127_2-02.htm]]><description> &lt;div>; Monday, November 27, 2023 &lt;/div>; &lt;!-ENPCONTENT->; &lt;p>; The Yellow River walks around the East China Sea, and write it into the chest. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Starting from the Qinghai -Tibet Plateau, wearing high mountains, Yue Canyon, Huibaichuan, Naqianliu, the Yellow River has more than 5,400 kilometers in the land of Shenzhou, nurturing tens of millions of Chinese children, nourishing the brilliant Chinese China civilization. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; General Secretary Xi Jinping cares about the mother river of this Chinese nation. Since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, he has traveled to 9 provinces and regions upstream and downstream of the Yellow River. Far conspiracy in the future. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;Let the Yellow River a happy river for the benefit of the people.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The words of words and love are cut, and the Jiuqu Yellow River stimulates a more majestic new era. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; The Governance of the Great River- &lt;/strong>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;The history of the Chinese nation&#39;s governance of the Yellow River is also a history &lt;p>; On September 17, 2019, Zhengzhou, Henan, the &quot;Qianqiu River&quot; exhibition hall of the Yellow River Museum. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In front of a historical Yellow River diversion map, General Secretary Xi Jinping stared for a long time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The scope of decisive overflowing to Tianjin, the south of the Jianghuai, 250,000 square kilometers in the south. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The Yellow River is both the mother and life of the Chinese nation, but also a unspeakable river. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Once upon a time, the Yellow River &quot;multi -stasis, multi -decision, more migration&quot;, &quot;three years of decisions, two years of changes in a hundred years&quot;. During the more than 2,500 years before the founding of New China, the downstream decided over 1,500 times. 26 times. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;Yellow River, the world is flat.&quot; &quot;In a sense, the history of the Chinese nation&#39;s governance of the Yellow River is also a history of governing the country.&quot; Relationship. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; For thousands of years, Huaxia&#39;s children prayed to the Yellow River Anlan. After the founding of New China, history placed the important task of controlling Huang in the hands of the Chinese Communists. According to statistics, since the founding of the People&#39;s Republic of China, the Yellow River has survived the autumn floods for more than 70 years and has been flowing continuously for 24 years. It has withstood 12 major floods and created a miracle of &quot;hanging river above the ground&quot; management. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;Practice has proved that only under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the advantage of the socialist system can truly realize the historic transformation from passive to active to active, and fundamentally change the tragic situation of the Yellow River in three years and two years. . &quot;General Secretary Xi Jinping said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; When you come to the Yellow River National Geological Park, General Secretary Xi Jinping sees the surrounding environment along the bank of the Yellow River. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Overlooking the bar, the sky is high in front of the eyes, and the forest is dense. In the mind of the General Secretary, he has a grand blueprint for the safety of the Yellow River. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The genus of the five harms, the water is the largest. Well aware of the importance and difficulty of water control, General Secretary Xi Jinping once pointed out: &quot;In the history of our five thousand years of Chinese civilization, some places have prospered and declined several times. Many rises and declines in history have happened in succession. If you want to be Guotai Min&#39;an and the year old, you must be good at controlling water. &quot;&lt;/P>; &lt;p>; Yellow River is undoubtedly the top priority of water treatment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;Everyone is very busy on the eve of the National Day. No matter how busy, the Yellow River problem still has to arrange the time to study it carefully. The Party Central Committee attaches great importance to this issue.&quot; At the meeting, General Secretary Xi Jinping Kai Zongyi. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;We all call the Yellow River as the mother river. Protecting the Yellow River is the great plan for the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation and the sustainable development.&quot; The significance of development. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;The Yellow River water is small and sand, and the relationship between water and sand is not coordinated. Hanging on his head, you can&#39;t relax your vigilance at all. &quot;&lt;/P>; &lt;p>; With such a sense of worry, General Secretary Xi Jinping has visited the Yellow River first line to inspect the flood situation many times. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Dongying, Shandong, the Yellow River enters Haikou. On October 20, 2021, General Secretary Xi Jinping came here. At that time, the autumn floods of the Yellow River had returned to the main river channel, but the &quot;crossing&quot; traces of more than 10 meters from the main river channel to the green belt of the dock were still clearly visible. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; As soon as I got off the car, the general secretary asked where the water edge line was when the water level was the highest time ago. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;This is the water edge of the beach on October 8th.&quot; On the dock, the person in charge of the Yellow River Estuary Administration held the exhibition board and reported to the General Secretary one by one. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The wharf is rushing, the general secretary reached out to help the shaking exhibition board, check carefully, and ask questions from time to time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; When I heard that the Yellow River Qiu Xun was &quot;shocked and dangerous&quot;, there was no major loss and casualties. The general secretary nodded. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;When you come here today, the Yellow River has arrived upstream, middle and downstream, and I feel at ease.&quot; General Secretary Xi Jinping said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; At the symposium two days later, the general secretary talked to the comrades responsible for governing Huang to talk about the original mission of the governance of the river: to do the matter of the Yellow River, &quot;This is also the wish of Chairman Mao that year.&quot; &quot;Now we have done it.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;We cannot be satisfied with the achievements we have achieved. We must adhere to the problem orientation, and make persistent efforts to do unswervingly.&quot; The general secretary said a long focus. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The lower reaches of the Yellow River has a vast &quot;beach area&quot;. The beach area between the main river channel and the flood control embankment is an important area for the Yellow River to carry out floods, detain floods, and settle sediment. It is also the place where people in the beach area live and produce. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;After the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, I care about the relocation of the Yellow River Beach District. It is a great thing to carry out relocation and relocation.&quot; The secretary saw the crowd of the Yellow River beach that he had been concerned about. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;Save money in three years, build a platform for three years, build a house for three years, and repay for three years&quot; is a true portrayal of the difficulty of the people in the beach area. Today, in the Yangmiao community, rows of buildings and roads are neatly intertwined, and modern convenience service facilities are complete, confirming the dramatic changes in the &quot;poor den&quot; of the past. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; On the Yellow River Dam, listen to history and see changes; in the restaurant of the elderly, the lid is lid, and the home is often; in the house of the residents, ask changes, listen to the voice of the people ... A stone in my heart fell to the ground, &quot;I am very pleased to see you living in peace and career.&quot; &lt;/P>; &lt;p>; &quot;What does the Communist Party do? It serves the people and seek revival for the Chinese nation, so we must continue to continue See what to do well, what must be done well, and governing the Yellow River is one of them. &quot;&lt;/P>; &lt;p>; This is the party&#39;s commitment to the people, and it is also the leader&#39;s deep affection for the people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; On the occasion of 2022, General Secretary Xi Jinping published a new year&#39;s congratulatory word. He said: &quot;In recent years, I have traveled to 9 provinces and regions of the Yellow River. Whether it is the Yellow River Yangtze River &#39;Mother River&#39;, or the rippling Qinghai Lake, the majestic Yarlung Zangbo River; The &#39;green map&#39; in the Hanya Forest Farm; whether it is the Yunnan Elephant Elephant to the north, or the Tibetan antelope reproduction and migration ... These are all showing that people live up to Qingshan, and Qingshan is not available. &quot;&lt;/P>; &lt;p>; Warm warmth The words are full of strength and inspiring. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; The Beauty of the Great River- &lt;/strong>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; >; &quot;I have said that the Yangtze River is sick and the disease is not light. Today I want to say that the Yellow River has always been weak and sick, and the water has frequent water.&quot; General Secretary Xi Jinping&#39;s &quot;health&quot; problem of the mother river was put on his stomach. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The disease of the Yellow River has not only the innate and incomplete objective constraints, but also the factors that have been demoded by the day after tomorrow -&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The soil and soil loss area of ​​the Yellow River Basin accounts for the largest proportion of the watershed area. ; Upstream and downstream ecology is easy to degenerate, the recovery is extremely difficult and the process is slow; the intensity of pollution emissions in some areas is high. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Ecological problems test historical vision. Standing at the height of the sustainable development of the Chinese nation, General Secretary Xi Jinping set a tone for the ecological protection and high -quality development of the Yellow River Basin- &quot;Grasp the Great Protection and Coordinate the Governance of Governance.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Overall the pulse and system. Coordinating upstream and downstream, dry tributaries, and left and right shores, the General Secretary requires the Yellow River ecosystem as an organic whole to plan: the upstream is mainly to improve the ability of water conservation; midstreams should highlight soil and water conservation and pollution control; downstream should focus on protecting the wetland ecology of the wetland ecology System, improve biodiversity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In August 2016, General Secretary Xi Jinping went to Qinghai to inspect. Starting from Beijing, the plane towards the west, via the North Plain, Yue Taihang Mountains, and passed the Loess Plateau to reach the Qinghai -Tibet Plateau. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Outside the porthole, the water of the Yellow River rushed all the way, and the complex and changeable topographic and generosity on both sides of the strait told people that the difficulty of ecological protection and governance of the Yellow River Basin facing is by no means unusual. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Qinghai has the source of the Yangtze River, the Yellow River, and Lancang River. The clean water output from here every year accounts for about half of the entire Yellow River Basin. In the minds of the General Secretary, Qinghai Ecology is like crystal, which is precious and very fragile. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In Charkhan Salt Lake, learn about the development of the Economic Development Economic Economic in Charhan; ​​in a clean energy enterprise, inspect the solar cell production line; at the provincial ecological environment monitoring center, look at the Eling Lake of Huanghe&#39;s source through remote videos -Zha -Zha Linghu and other points are monitored in real time ... During the inspection, General Secretary Xi Jinping was very concerned about the ecological protection of Qinghai. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; General Secretary clearly requires: &quot;The biggest value of Qinghai is ecological and greatest responsibility in ecology and the biggest potential in ecology, and the construction of ecological civilization must be placed in a prominent position.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; At a symposium, the protection of the &quot;China Water Pagoda&quot; was mentioned. The General Secretary proposed: If you think about whether this is important in China or the green mountains? As a place of water conservation, it takes the task of maximizing ecological functions, rather than decided to build a factory, open a mine, and get some domestic GDP. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; From the &quot;China Water Tower&quot; Sanjiang source from the upstream, to the &quot;Central Water Tower&quot; Qinling Mountains in the middle reaches, the &quot;North China Water Pagoda&quot; Shanxi ... Yamana, the water journey, the general secretary is the &quot;big of the country&quot; . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;You are the water source of the North China Water Tower, the water source of the Beijing -Tianjin -Hebei, it is an important part of the three north protective forests. General Secretary Xi Jinping emphasized during the investigation of Shanxi. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The second largest branch of the Yellow River has bred a splendid Sanjin culture. Due to excessive development in the basin, the Fenhe ecology has been greatly damaged, and the water quality is severely polluted. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; General Secretary Xi Jinping requested: &quot;We must pay great attention to the ecological environmental protection of the Fenhe River, so that the water volume of the mother&#39;s river in Shanxi is full, the water quality is better, and the scenery is beautiful.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p >; This time, when I came to Shanxi, the General Secretary made a special trip to the bank of the Fen River to take a look. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The local comrades reported that Taiyuan City adopted measures such as the comprehensive governance of the Fenhe and the &quot;Jiuhe&quot; and the ecological restoration of the river basin. The quality of the Fenhe River gradually improved. The greening belt on both sides of the strait became a place for citizens to leisure and entertainment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The General Secretary nodded frequently: &quot;It&#39;s really vicissitudes! Taiyuan has been&quot; Splendid Taiyuan City, surrounded by mountains on three sides, and the reputation of one water. Now the beauty of Taiyuan is becoming reality. &quot;&lt;/ P>; &lt;p>; &quot;It is necessary to effectively protect, manage the Fenhe River, reproduce the beautiful scenery of the late Fen River in the ancient Jin Dynasty, and let Yichong water enter the Yellow River.&quot; The General Secretary emphasized the local leading cadres. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Looking north from the Huangkou of the Fenhe River, the Yellow River split the Jin and Shaanxi Canyon, and the loess plateau on both sides is rolling and undulating. This is an important source of the Yellow River sediment. Today, Lvyi is dyeing this yellow land. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In the golden autumn season of 2022, the apple garden in Nantou Village, Gaoqiao Town, Ansai District, Yan&#39;an City, Shaanxi Province has a good harvest scene. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; General Secretary Xi Jinping walked into the orchard, and the fellows communicated cordially, and picked a big red apple. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Yan&#39;an, once one of the worst soil loss in my country. Today, as the measures to regurgle farmers and forests, trees planting, etc., the measures that continue to promote soil and soil loss have continued to advance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The General Secretary once cut in in northern Shaanxi, recalling the educated youth years, saying that in the past, the northern Shaanxi villagers cultivated terraces and planting crops, facing the loess to the sky, raised the old hoe to work, and they were widely planted. Nowadays, the farmland on the hillside has been species on apples. The fellows have work and stable income. Children have good education. The elderly have medical insurance, and their lives are getting better and better. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Think of it. From the source of the Sanjiang to the Bohai Sea, General Secretary Xi Jinping&#39;s steps and directions are full of concern. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In October 2021, when the Yellow River entered Haikou, the General Secretary walked deep into the wetland along the wooden boardwalk and inspected the park of this animation and plant -autumn, sea breeze blowing, reed flowers swaying, a few of them, a few of them, a few of them, a few of them, a few of them. Hongyan and spotted goose inhabit the small continents in the water. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The local responsible comrades introduced that in recent years, through the return of farmland to wet, recover the beach, promote the repair of wetland, and the ecological environment is getting better and better. &quot;We are the hometown of Eastern Baiji, China, and the black -billed gull breeding place. Since last year, a newly discovered flamingo, white pelicans, and spoon buns.&quot; &lt;/P>; &lt;p>; &quot;There are many tourists who come here ? &quot;The General Secretary asked. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;At the most, the number of tourists is 600,000 times, and we have limited the largest number of tourists every day.&quot; The local person in charge replied. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; General Secretary told: &quot;To manage well, we must not be polluted by wetlands, and we cannot hunt or set up birds to catch birds.&quot; &lt;/P>; &lt;p>; Today, the country is being created here. The national park, promoting a series of ecological protection and restoration projects, Damei Wetland shows its vitality. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;It is not conducive to the ecological protection of the Yellow River Basin, and it cannot be done.&quot; The General Secretary&#39;s request is deafening. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Upstream protection, midstream governance, downstream repair. Following the guidelines of General Secretary Xi Jinping, local governments take the protection as the red line and &quot;treat the disease&quot; for the Yellow River. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; The main river of the river- &lt;/strong>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; /P>; &lt;p>; &quot;7 provinces on the upper and middle reaches of the Yellow River are inadequate development, and there is a significant gap compared with the eastern region and the Yangtze River Basin. &lt;p>; Facing the difficulties and problems existing in the high -quality development of the Yellow River Basin, General Secretary Xi Jinping had deeply analyzed it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Develop or protect first? Control supply or control needs? Do you conspire or conspire? Promoting high -quality development, facing more contradictions and entanglements in the Yellow River Basin, you need to have thousands of miles of thinking and vision. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;从三江源到入海口，从“黄河流域生态保护和高质量发展座谈会”到“深入推动黄河流域生态保护和高质量发展座谈会”，习近平总书记一路调研思索、 The problem solving the problem. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; To promote the high -quality development of the Yellow River Basin, the relationship between development and protection must be clarified. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The north bank of the Yellow River, Yuncheng, Shanxi. The colorful salt lake witnessed the industrial change of &quot;Salt City&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; On May 16, 2023, next to the salt lake in Yuncheng, there was a white Hedong big salt on the booth. General Secretary Xi Jinping combined with the introduction of exhibition boards and exhibits to listen to the relevant situation, and inspect the scene of salt lake on the spot. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The history of salt mining for more than 4,600 years, and the history of 70 years of inorganic salt development -Yuncheng flooded due to salt, but also faced the dilemma of excessive mining, old industry, and aggravating pollution due to long -term resource dependence. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;Adhere to ecological priority and green development&quot;. With the implementation of ecological protection of the Yellow River Basin and the implementation of the national strategy of high -quality development, Yuncheng ushered in the opportunity of transformation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Retreat and return to the lake, and change the cage for birds! &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; From 2020, all industrial production has been stopped within the protection scope of salt lakes, and salt lakes have begun to transform from mining areas and industrial areas to ecological protection areas and tourist punch locations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; At the same time, Yuncheng accelerates the cultivation of emerging industrial clusters such as automotive equipment manufacturing, new materials, green building materials, electronic information, food and medicine, etc., and uses location advantages to create a new highlands to the outside world inland. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; General Secretary Xi Jinping pointed out the development direction of the provinces and regions along the Yellow River: the provinces and regions of the Yellow River Basin must adhere to the protection of the ecology of the Yellow River Basin as the benchmark line for planning development and promoting high -quality development. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; To promote the high -quality development of the Yellow River Basin, we must balance the relationship between supply and demand. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Nanyang, Henan, the three major basins of the Yellow River, Yangtze River, and Huaihe River, and the first phase of the South Water -to -North Diversion Middle Line &quot;faucet&quot; and &quot;general switch&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;I have always wanted to come in this place.&quot; On May 13, 2021, the first phase of the project canal. General Secretary Xi Jinping stood at the head of the ship and was concerned. &quot;The construction of the South Water and North Diversion Project, the operation of this place, and the immigration work here, I have been paying attention. I am very happy to see this time.&quot; The source of life is necessary. The distribution of water resources in my country is extremely uneven. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; At the subsequent symposium, General Secretary Xi Jinping pointed out: &quot;Entering the new stage of development, implementing the new development concept, and building a new development pattern, forming a large unified market and unblocked domestic cycle The coordinated development requires the strong support of water resources. &quot;&lt;/P>; &lt;p>; In a word, water resources are placed at a strategic height related to the development of the country. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The total amount of water resources is only 7%of the Yangtze River, but it undertakes the national population, 17%of cultivated land, and more than 50 large and medium -sized cities in the country. The contradiction between supply and demand is even more prominent. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; What is the problem? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; General Secretary Xi Jinping&#39;s book is firm: insisting on setting the city with water, setting the water with water, setting up water by water, and water production by water. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; This is a deep water -saving and water -controlling battle: the promotion of water -saving irrigation, developing drought agriculture, carrying out animal husbandry and fishery water saving, strengthening the use of recycled water, and promoting rainwater use ... &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; This is a strict rigid constraint: establish a water resource bearing capacity partition management and control system, restrict the construction scale of urban development, high water consumption projects and large -scale species trees in the area of ​​severe shortage of water resources, and establish a total water control system covering the total water control system covered in the entire basin … &lt;/P>; &lt;p>; Acting in the Yellow River Basin, the simplicity of &quot;how many soups are soaked&quot; are deeply rooted in people&#39;s hearts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; To promote the high -quality development of the Yellow River Basin, we must coordinate the relationship between the overall and local. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The profit of the Yellow River in the Ningxia Plain has been known as &quot;Jiangnan&quot; since ancient times. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; On June 9, 2020, in the rural ecological tourism park in the rice and fishing space in Helan County, Yinchuan City, General Secretary Xi Jinping boarded the viewing tower and overlooking the entire park; The working villagers talked cordially; picked up fish seedlings, crab seedlings, and put them into the canal of the field ... &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Here, the general secretary emphasized to pay attention to solving the contradiction between rice, water -saving technology, actively developing festivals, actively developing festivals Water type and high value -added breeding industry protect the Yellow River water resources. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;Efforts to build ecological protection and high -quality development zone in the Yellow River Basin.&quot; At that trip to Ningxia, General Secretary Xi Jinping put forward earnest expectations for Ningxia. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; First, it is not only the encouragement of daring to try, but also a profound positioning. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; It is required to &quot;create more ecological products&quot; in Sanjiangyuan, Qilian Mountain and other regions, and instructs the main food producing areas such as the river system irrigation district and the Fenwei Plain to &quot;contribute to ensure the safety of national food&quot; and instruct the regional central cities and other economies. In areas with good development conditions, &quot;Improving the Economic and Population Carrying Power&quot; ... &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Standing at the height of the overall situation, General Secretary Xi Jinping precisely planned to develop positioning along the provinces and regions of the Yellow River to guide the &quot;one game of chess&quot; along the coast of the Yellow River. Thought, play the Yellow River chorus of the new era. &lt;/P>; &lt;p>; To promote the high -quality development of the Yellow River Basin, we must plan the current relationship with the long -term relationship. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;The person who opened the canal, leave the name, leave the name of the history!&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; On June 6, 2023, General Secretary Xi Jinping came to another agricultural land on the edge of the Yellow River ——The Baba Iyano, Inner Mongolia, stops in front of the sand table in the water volume information monitoring center of the river irrigation area for a long time. &lt;/P>; &lt;p>; Since the founding of New China, the construction of water conservancy for decades has been printed on the river -style plain, and the 7 -level irrigation and arranging system is extended like human blood. Half. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; General Secretary admired this irrigation system: &quot;It will stay as a century -old and millennium base in the future.&quot; &lt;/P>; &lt;p>; The next day, General Secretary Xi Jinping listened to the local area in Hohhot City. The introduction of the development of new energy and new materials industries, promoting the optimization and adjustment of industrial structure, and promoting the development of green and low -carbon. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;What&#39;s the next plan?&quot; The general secretary asked. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The comrades responsible for the development of the energy industry reported: &quot;It is estimated that by 2025, the installation and power generation of new energy in Inner Mongolia will be more than 2022, and the amount of electricity will be more than two or more.&quot; &lt;/p >; &lt;p>; General Secretary Xi Jinping urged: &quot;Inner Mongolia&#39;s energy industry has been mainly coal and produced by coal for a long time. However, the industry is too single, and the diversified development is the direction. , Clean energy, work hard to achieve carbon peak carbon neutralization, and build green China. &quot;&lt;/P>; &lt;p>; From the irrigation canal, see the foundation of the millennium; from the new energy industry, see the prospects of green China, General Secretary Xi Jinping Care about the current Yellow River, and also draws the future of the basin. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;Promote the ecological protection and high -quality development of the Yellow River Basin, it is not a day.&quot; To deal with the current relationship between the current and the future, General Secretary Xi Jinping warned- &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;To maintain Historical patience and strategic determination, with achievements, do not have to have my historical responsibility in my spiritual realm and achievement.

&lt;strong>; “印尼和中国双边合作的杰出范例”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;记者上车后不久，高铁列车缓缓启动并逐渐提速。窗外，静谧的村庄、绿油油的农田一闪而过。车厢内，电子屏幕上滚动显示实时车速，最高时速达350公里。记者将矿泉水瓶倒立在窗台上，一路平稳。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“有了高铁，雅加达似乎离万隆更近了！”家住万隆的印尼姑娘索菲安·日吉娜告诉记者，高铁列车快速而平稳，车厢干净整洁，内部设计十分符合印尼人的喜好。日吉娜常常前往雅加达，她说：“高铁让我们节省了大量时间和精力，很自豪印尼有了先进便捷的高铁。”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;自2018年6月正式动工，到今年10月17日正式开通运营，中印尼两国建设者携手攻坚，历经近2000个日日夜夜，打通隧道13座，架设桥梁56座。在解决各类难题的过程中，“中国智造”不断彰显强大生命力。针对印尼地震多发，动车组专门配备地震预警系统；为应对当地高温、高湿、高盐雾气候对动车组服役寿命的影响，技术团队开展两年的现场户外试验，测试上百种车体材料和涂层样件，量身定制防腐优化方案；针对沿线复杂地形条件，升级10余版列车网络控制软件和牵引软件，成功开发高加速功能。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;印尼中国高速铁路有限公司董事总经理德维亚纳·斯拉梅·里亚迪表示：“两国建设者携手合作推动项目建设，克服了很多困难和障碍。雅万高铁项目各环节进展顺利，是印尼和中国双边合作的杰出范例。”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;西爪哇省万隆市的德卡鲁尔镇，周围群山环绕，河流蜿蜒而过。一座波浪形的建筑，高低错落，似山峦叠翠，与群山呼应，也似奔驰的列车，融入周遭山川河流。这就是雅万高铁的终点站德卡鲁尔车站。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;从泗水到雅加达出差的阿南沙，特意赶来乘坐雅万高铁。他告诉记者：“乘坐高铁的感觉棒极了！希望印尼的高铁线路进一步延伸，让我们的出行更加便利，让铁路沿线经济得到更大发展。”&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;出站口一侧，一家出租车公司的销售人员正在招揽客人。名叫萨塔的年轻人告诉记者，他此前在一家酒店做同样的工作，揽到的活儿十分有限。不久前，公司安排他到车站工作，每天能揽到40多单生意，业绩翻了好几番。萨塔说：“我现在每天都干劲儿十足。”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>; &lt;strong>; “高铁带来的不仅有人，还有机会”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;雅万高铁所在的爪哇岛人口约1.5亿，占印尼人口的一半多，是印尼经济文化最为发达的地区。西爪哇省前省长里德万·卡米勒表示：“高铁带来的不仅有人，还有机会。围绕交通枢纽规划新城市建设发展，将创造出新经济与新就业。”在德卡鲁尔车站工作的附近村民罗米深有同感：“雅万高铁让我们的生活有了更多的希望。”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;据不完全统计，雅万高铁迄今已为印尼累计带来5.1万人次就业，预计投入运营后的客运服务、设备检修及相关配套产业延伸服务将创造3万个就业岗位。同时，项目75%以上的服务和采购是在印尼当地，对本地供应链和劳动力就业的拉动作用明显，特别是为印尼培养了数千名合格的技术人员，为雅万高铁长期稳定运营奠定了Base. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;雅万高铁建设期间，通过建立培训机构、中方员工“师傅带徒弟”、现场实训等方式，累计培训印尼员工超过4.5万人次。 “听说印尼要建设第一条高铁，我专门到雅万高铁项目部寻找就业机会。”印尼籍员工詹振豪说，他从雅万高铁1号梁场的安全管理工作开始做起，现在已成为项目安全环保部副主任，还在项目部推荐下参加了雅万高铁印尼员工赴中国交流的活动。 “感谢中方团队传授的技术和经验，为印尼培养了第一批高铁技术人员。”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;在位于东爪哇省的小城茉莉芬，坐落着印尼交通部下属的印尼铁路理工学院.今年2月，雅万高铁首批运维人员培训班在这里举办。接受培训的印尼籍学员共173名，由中方运维管理团队和中国铁路专业院校负责授课，重点培养动车组司机、动车组机械师、运行控制中心调度人员和应急值守人员等4个专业岗位personnel. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;参加动车组机械师培训的安迪说：“中国拥有全球最大的高速铁路网。中方利用自己的先进技术和知识，帮助印尼培养自己的高铁技术人才，期待两国进一步加深合作。”卢斯菲安从印尼铁路理工学院毕业后转入培训班学习调度管理，她告诉记者：“培训期间，我收到了人生第一份工资，远高于茉莉芬当地的平均水平。雅万高铁不仅推动了印尼的经济发展，也切实改善了我们的生活。”&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“雅万高铁是中国和印尼人民共同建设的。”印尼中国高速铁路有限公司执行董事张超表示，在合作的过程中，中印尼团队相互交流、融合，促进了两国民心相通、相互理解，有助于巩固中印尼长期友好合作的基础。印尼交通部部长布迪·卡里亚·苏马迪说，雅万高铁为印尼提供了技术飞跃的机会，也能促进印尼本地配套产业链的发展。除了高铁外，印尼期待与中方在飞机制造、航运等领域进一步加强合作。 &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;（本报雅加达电）&lt;/p>;&lt;!--/enpcontent-->;</description><pubDate> Mon, 27 Nov 2023 05:56:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[03版要闻 - 马达加斯加农户有了新选择（国际论坛·共享机遇、共谋发展的阳光大道）]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://paper.people.com.cn/rmrb/html/2023-11/27/nw.D110000renmrb_20231127_2-03.htm]]><description> &lt;div>;2023年11月27日星期一&lt;/div>;
