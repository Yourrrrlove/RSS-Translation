The staff on duty immediately checked the camera and found that the tap water pipe excretion valve was leaked at a camera about 100 meters away from the pudding. Immediately contacted the tap water company maintenance personnel to the scene to handle it. In normal working status, &quot;intelligent monitoring can find problems in time. At the same time, after the pipeline is entered into the corridor, it is more convenient to avoid the situation of digging roads to digging the pipeline.&quot; &lt;/P>; &lt;p>; In addition, intelligent inspection robots are also in The &quot;staff&quot; of daily patrol can realize the functions of automatic collection, automatic analysis, and automatic alarm of the pipe gallery disease. At present, it has achieved more than 70%of the daily inspection items. It can be inspected more than 10 kilometers per day. Safety is becoming more and more secure. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; This is a microcosm of the comprehensive pipe corridor in Tianfu New District, Sichuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Chengdu has made efforts to promote the construction of underground pipe corridors in accordance with the pilot work of the National Underground Comprehensive Pipe Corridor, uniformly plan and centralize various pipelines. As of now, as the second batch of pilot cities of the underground comprehensive pipe galleries in the country, Chengdu is forming a pipe corridor construction model suitable for local characteristics. It has been built with 125.4 kilometers of pipe gallery, construction is 65.6 kilometers under construction, put into operation of 58.8 kilometers, and a total of 249.76 corridor is completed. kilometer. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;We closely focus on the use of underground space, coordinate layout, and build a sponge city to fully reflect the construction concept of construction industrialization and informatization &#39;.&quot; Liu Zhenxin said that at present, Tianfu New District has been built and has a mileage of more than 75 kilometers under construction, of which more than 60 kilometers are put into operation. The main streets are basically no longer there are &quot;urban spider web&quot; and &quot;zipper road&quot; and other phenomena. The web off -the -counter and other decreased decreased significantly used the urban underground space to make the park cities with &quot;face&quot; and &quot;li&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; At present, Chengdu is carried out a repair work on the special planning combined with the land and space planning, and is planned to build about 1,000 kilometers in 2035. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; For many years of exploration, Chengdu has realized the pipe gallery to make the pipe gallery through the construction method of &quot;ring+shooting&quot;. The pipelines in the Harmonies run efficiently. At the same time, Chengdu has gradually constructed the &quot;1+1+N&quot; intelligent management system including the Municipal General Control Center, Tianfu New District Disaster Center, and N sub -control centers. Platform, relying on information technology to explore unmanned supervision of the pipe gallery. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; The city is smarter &lt;/strong>; &lt;strong>; &amp; nbsp; &amp; nbsp; &lt;/strong>; &lt;strong>; Service efficiency &lt;/strong>; &lt;/p>; Voice warnings will be issued; visibility becomes poor, and the street lights will be dimmed on demand ... In Chengdu Dong&#39;an Lake Sports Park, 1,200 street lights are very &quot;smart&quot;. With the charging pile, LED information release screen, camera and other devices equipped with the light rod, relying on the Internet of Things and Internet technology, the street lights transformed into the nerve ending of the smart city, making Smart Rongcheng feel sensible. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The people&#39;s city is built, and the people&#39;s city is the people. How to make the city more intelligent? In recent years, focusing on public safety, public management, public services, and digital economies, Chengdu has taken the construction of Smart Rongcheng as a traction, and comprehensively improves the scientific and agile governance level of oversized cities in accordance with the overall idea of ​​&quot;1+4+2&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The party secretary and director of the Chengdu Municipal Government Service Management and Network Political Affairs Office, Feng Xiusu, introduced that Smart Rongcheng Construction of the &quot;Wang&quot; font structure can be summarized by &quot;three -level platforms and 5 applications&quot;: &quot;Wang&quot; The first horizontal word is the municipal city -level city transport platform. It connects the municipal department -level departments on the platform, and connects the county (city, district) platform vertically. Erheng, is a county (city, district) -level urban transport platform and municipal departments urban transportation platform, supporting the realization of the operation monitoring and early warning, rapid response, efficient disposal, uploading and off; third horizontal city transport platform The role of early discovery and early disposal of risks is played; The urban transport platform extends down to the village (community) and grids to form five -level applications. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Anchor the &quot;1&quot; goal.
