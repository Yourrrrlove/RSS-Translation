The determination and intensity are unprecedented. Today, the Yangtze River Economic Belt has increasingly become the main battlefield for my country&#39;s eco-first green development, smoothing the domestic and international dual-circulation aorta, and leading the main force in high-quality economic development. The development achievements are obvious to all, the quality of development has been steadily improved, and the development trend is getting better. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Thoughts lead development and strategies plan the future.

To promote high-quality development, we have hosted four symposiums and delivered important speeches in Chongqing, Wuhan, Nanjing, and Nanchang. We have conducted in-depth inspections and surveys along the Yangtze River for many times, and issued important instructions and instructions on the development of the Yangtze River Economic Belt.

We must further promote the high-quality development of the Yangtze River Economic Belt, implement new development concepts completely, accurately, and comprehensively, and adhere to joint efforts to jointly grasp the major issues. Protect and avoid large-scale development, adhere to ecological priority and green development, take scientific and technological innovation as the guide, coordinate the promotion of ecological environmental protection and economic and social development, strengthen policy coordination and work coordination, and strive to build the Yangtze River Economic Belt into a more beautiful ecology and better transportation A golden economic belt with smoother economy, more coordinated economy, more unified market and more scientific mechanism. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;General Secretary Xi Jinping emphasized: “In the long run, promoting the high-quality development of the Yangtze River Economic Belt fundamentally depends on the high-quality ecological environment of the Yangtze River Basin.
