Liu&#39;s first long article elaborated on his version of the inside story of the &quot;mother and son fighting for the birth&quot; of his ex-wife and their son, while the second long article accused Zhen Zhen of being incompetent in raising her son and &quot;being a shameless mother.&quot; After Liu Jiachang published his first long article, Zhen Zhen also published a thousand-word article to counterattack, and the two of them were &quot;at odds with each other&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Weibo promotion&quot; triggered by celebrities&#39; &quot;divorce essays&quot; once again occupied the hot search, and showed a similar plot to similar incidents in the past: one party took the lead in attacking, and looked eloquent. The words are righteous and well-founded; the other party fights back and refutes point by point, which seems to be righteous and sensible. For a time, public opinion was greatly divided. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu Jiachang’s main accusation against Zhen Zhen can be divided into two parts. The first is the issue of division of marital property. Liu Jiachang accused Zhenzhen of transferring Liu&#39;s assets to her name in various ways over the years, including but not limited to company equity, music copyrights and cash income; the second was the issue of his son&#39;s education and growth. Liu accused Zhen Zhen of controlling his son but failing to teach him how to spoil him. He made his son drop out of school again and again and became naughty. He got into troubles including drunkenness, racing, beating people, and soliciting prostitutes. Liu tried his best to encourage his son to make music, but failed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To sum up, Liu Jiachang claimed that he &quot;disclosed his family affairs&quot; because of his failed marriage and hurt feelings. He posted a long article accusing Zhenzhen mother and son just to vent his anger so as not to &quot;die unjustly&quot;. It seems inappropriate. It was all about fighting for property, because he also promised to donate his property to charity if he won the case. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Regarding Liu’s first long article, Zhen Zhen also issued a counterattack, accusing Liu Jiachang of being addicted to gambling and suppressing his son. It was Liu Jiachang who stole his property, not the other way around; Liu Jiachang After the second long article was released, Zhen Zhen also criticized Liu Jiachang for slandering herself and her son, saying, &quot;It&#39;s really shameless.&quot; Their son Zhang Liheng (formerly known as Liu Ziqian) also supported his mother on social media. The &quot;mutual conflict&quot; between the two sides shows that each has his own words, but in order to determine which is right and which is wrong, we should return to the level of facts and legal principles. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the property dispute between the two parties, there are many factual issues that are not difficult to prove or falsify. Written evidence can be used to determine whether these properties were earned by Liu Jiachang, or whether they were simply &quot;registered in the name of his wife Zhenzhen&quot; as joint property of the couple. For example, the audit report mentioned by Liu Jiachang, and the Income details, tax return records, property registration records from the three places across the Taiwan Strait and the United States, as well as legal documents regarding music copyrights, company equity, real estate ownership, and the agreements between the two parties regarding the property, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhen Zhen accused Liu Jiachang of being &quot;addicted to gambling&quot;, and Liu Jiachang responded that &quot;he only used his own money for gambling.&quot; Liu Jiachang accused Zhen Zhen of &quot;not filming for forty years&quot; and that all the joint property was earned by herself. Zhen Zhen also personally told the media that every penny earned by Liu was given to Zhen Zhen and her family. It&#39;s not difficult to prove. Liu&#39;s accusation and response can be summarized as, &quot;It is normal for a husband to make money outside and leave it to his wife to take care of, but Zhen Zhen should not assume that she earned all the money.&quot; Whether this argument can be established is the key issue in determining whether the dispute is right or wrong. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The second part of Liu Jiachang’s accusation, “Unvirtuous wife and unfilial son,” is even more difficult to verify because of its rich details and specific descriptions. Liu Wen accused Zhen Zhen of failing to teach her son well and his son was naughty and naughty. He was forced to drop out of school in Hong Kong, Shanghai, and the United States. He also got into troubles including drunkenness, beating people, speed driving, and soliciting prostitutes. Zhen Zhen even &quot;solicited prostitutes on behalf of her son.&quot; , these are specific and severe public accusations. Liu Jiachang should be responsible for providing evidence and ensuring the authenticity of the accusations, otherwise it will be suspected of slander. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu Jiachang also revealed in the long article that his son was able to successfully enroll in school or escape punishment many times by relying on his connections with &quot;big men&quot; such as Run Run Shaw. If these incidents really happened, there must be others. There are too many informed third parties who can verify one by one, and it does not rule out that there are still many cases that can be verified. Liu Jiachang also mentioned that he tried his best to help his son make music but failed. This can also be supported by the record company and related people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From a legal perspective, it is meaningless for both parties to resort to personal attacks in moral trials. The focus should still be on the common property division issues in divorce proceedings. Both parties accuse each other of embezzling their own property. This should be left to professional lawyers who specialize in marriage law and company law to litigate the game. Everything should be carried out according to normal litigation procedures; Zhen Zhen said that the two parties had divorced in the United States in 1987, and Liu Jiachang said It is said that the divorce was filed in Hong Kong in 2015. The truth needs to be determined by courts in many places and even many countries. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Whose essay should the public believe? This still requires facts as the basis and law as the criterion in order to arrive at a fairer judgment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The divorce dispute between Liu Jiachang and Zhen Zhen has actually been going on for many years. The reason why old matters have resurfaced is because of the property division disputes arising from the divorce, as well as the huge interest entanglement mixed with the relationship between parent and child. Even an ordinary couple will have similar &quot;Rashomon&quot; problems during divorce disputes, let alone a celebrity couple who need to divide huge amounts of property and have huge conflicts of interest. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Judging from Liu Jiachang&#39;s accusations, he is quite resentful of &quot;having his feelings hurt by money&quot; and resentment of &quot;having money hurt because of his feelings.&quot; The impression between the lines is that he was originally He is an &quot;old-school face-saving person&quot; who follows the traditional Chinese marriage and family values ​​of &quot;men taking care of the outside and women taking care of the house&quot;, but he is exhausted physically and mentally by his wife&#39;s deliberate &quot;marriage competition&quot;. The reason why their marriage failed was that they fell into a vicious cycle of &quot;talking about feelings hurts money, talking about money hurts feelings&quot;. Unclear financial decisions and inadequate marriage and love decisions were also important factors. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Comparing many cases of &quot;peaceful breakup&quot; and &quot;mutual divorce&quot; between celebrity couples, it can be seen that the key to the success of &quot;peaceful breakup&quot; is that both parties have fully completed the notarization of pre-marital property and the division of post-marital property. Procedure, the method of &quot;first being a villain and then being a gentleman&quot; is equivalent to &quot;pursuing common feelings with common interests&quot; rather than &quot;seeking interests in the name of feelings&quot;. Before marriage, clarify the distribution of property and custody rights in the event of divorce. In the end, the respective interests of both parties are better protected, and they will not be reduced to online battles with short essays. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is said that the merger of two well-off houses in first-tier cities is like the merger of two companies, and there will be problems in the distribution of large amounts of property. It is best to divide the property before marriage to effectively avoid possible disputes. In comparison, celebrity marriages involve huge amounts of property. Before getting married, they should agree on how to divide property and child custody rights in the event of a breakup. Otherwise, they will inevitably fall into a &quot;complaint dispute&quot;. This time Liu Jiachang and Zhen Zhen were at odds with each other, which once again proved this point. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 04 Nov 2023 17:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[环状RNA有望成为下一代重磅药物]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259706]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-04 15:15:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;For the invention of mRNA vaccine technology, American scientists Katalin Karikó and Drew Wei Drew Weissman won the 2023 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. The mRNA vaccine has not only saved millions of people around the world from being killed by the new coronavirus, but has also brought tens of billions of dollars in revenue to institutions and scientists engaged in vaccine development and production. This has drawn much attention to RNA, an unstable small nucleic acid molecule. Scientists and medical research and development institutions are working hard to develop new RNA drugs, and circular RNA is expected to become the next generation of blockbuster RNA drugs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/PeKYI0DjhC680SKp0veP23hYpVIlP2zwrilYSNFF.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1248&quot; height= &quot;814&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/PeKYI0DjhC680SKp0veP23hYpVIlP2zwrilYSNFF.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256317&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Circular RNA therapy is gaining more and more attention. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Nature website/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;What is circular RNA&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Each The DNA molecule of a gene generally contains several exon sequences, separated by introns. It must first be transcribed into a single-stranded precursor mRNA. After shearing by shearing enzyme, the intron part is cut out, and then the exon part is cut out. The exons are spliced ​​together to form a functional mRNA, which then binds to the ribosome and guides it to synthesize proteins. Therefore, mRNA is a &quot;reduced version&quot; of the gene&#39;s DNA molecule, carrying the complete genetic information of the gene in the most streamlined nucleotides. The reason why mRNA can be used as a vaccine is that it can directly instruct cells to synthesize the corresponding antigen proteins, thereby triggering the body&#39;s immune system to produce antibodies to fight the virus. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the mRNA vaccine had a bumpy road before encountering the new coronavirus, and it was basically ignored. As a result, Carrico was unable to receive funding, and was transferred, reduced, or even fired from his job many times. Compared with double-stranded DNA molecules of genes, mRNA molecules have a simple structure and are extremely unstable. They generally have a single-stranded linear structure and are easily broken down by RNase. Therefore, the half-life of mRNA in the body is usually only a few hours. Such a short survival time is enough for vaccines, because the mRNA can immediately guide the cells to synthesize antigen proteins after entering the cells. However, for diseases such as cancer, neurological diseases, and genetic diseases that require large amounts of continuous protein treatment, the RNA persists in the body. time is too short. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Interestingly, RNase mainly &quot;bullies&quot; linear RNA, but has no way of attacking circular RNA. In fact, scientists have discovered that there is a kind of RNA in living organisms that can be connected end to end and likes to circle around itself more than 40 years ago. Through the continuous efforts of scientists, this circular RNA has recently begun to show great medical uses. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1976, Swiss virologist Daniel Kola Kofsky and a German research team discovered circular RNAs in mouse and plant viruses respectively. Circular forms are present in viruses, but have not attracted enough attention. In the early 1990s, researchers discovered such circular RNA molecules in human and other mammalian cells and proved that these circular RNAs are the transcript products of certain genes. Later, scientists discovered that circular RNA exists in almost all living things. However, compared with linear RNA, most circular RNA splicing is often chaotic and cannot guide cells to synthesize the corresponding proteins. It is also unclear what the purpose of circular RNA is. In the first thirty years after the discovery of circular RNA, , people have always mistaken it as the product of incorrect splicing during gene transcription, so it has not attracted much attention. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;With the development of RNA sequencing technology, scientists have discovered that circular RNA is very abundant in mammalian cells, highly conserved, far more stable than linear RNA, and plays many functions, and is not dispensable &quot;junk&quot; . Research shows that more than 60% of human genes can produce both circular and linear transcripts. Currently, more than 100,000 types of circular RNA have been discovered in human cells, which is much higher than the number of known human genes (about 20,000). ). Because it is not susceptible to RNase degradation, in some cells, the half-life of natural circRNA can be 2-4 times that of linear RNA, or even longer, while synthetic circRNA can survive in cells for several days, and The abundance of circular RNA in cells can reach more than 10 times that of linear RNA of related genes. Scientists have also discovered that endogenous circRNAs are involved in a variety of biological functions, including gene transcription, protein translation, immune response, cell proliferation and physiological regulation of tumorigenesis, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Most circular RNAs lack the necessary structure for ribosome recognition and are generally non-coding, that is, they cannot translate proteins. However, there are also a few that are coding RNAs, and these encoded proteins can also function. normal functionality. In 1995, researchers at the University of Colorado Health Science Center realized the coding function of circular RNA in vitro for the first time. Adding an internal ribosome entry site was crucial. This also laid the foundation for the development of circular RNA as vaccines and protein drugs. . &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Technological breakthroughs bring hope&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Since most natural circular RNAs cannot encode proteins and must be artificially designed and synthesized, scientists have Circular RNA technology has undergone a series of improvements and improvements, and has achieved a series of major breakthroughs. For example, in July 2022, the research team of Howard Y. Chang at Stanford University published an important study in the journal Nature Biotechnology. They made a series of improvements to the structure of circular RNA and optimized the translation process. Modules such as the initiation region, termination region, and internal ribosome entry site are implemented, and modular assembly is achieved, making protein translation easier to initiate and more efficient. Compared with unmodified circRNA, the recombinant protein expression level of modified circRNA can be increased hundreds of times. In vivo experiments in mice have shown that circRNA can be maintained in cells for more than 7 days, and only a small amount of circRNA molecules are needed to maintain high protein levels in cells for a longer period of time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Other major technological breakthroughs include: adding complementary sequences at both ends and in the middle of RNA to allow RNA to automatically form a loop and be more stable; allowing circular RNA to carry longer nucleotide chains, such as more than 12,000 nucleotide dystrophin gene sequence to synthesize more complex proteins; optimize circRNA delivery systems, such as lentivirus or exosome systems, to efficiently deliver circRNA to target cells; use genetic engineering technology Prepare circRNA on a large scale to save a lot of cost and time in circRNA preparation, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to technological improvements, the potential application of circular RNA in the medical field is another research hotspot. In March 2022, Peking University Wei Wensheng&#39;s team published a paper in the journal Cell confirming that compared with linear mRNA vaccines, circular RNA vaccines can induce more neutralizing antibodies and more effective T Cellular response. In May 2023, Zhang Yuanhao&#39;s team at Stanford University published an article in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences proving that circRNA has the potential to be developed into anti-viral and anti-tumor vaccines. They used circRNA prepared in vitro (can encode viral protein antigens) Immunization of mice induces innate activation of dendritic cells, stimulating robust antigen-specific CD8 T cell responses in lymph nodes and tissues. Immunity experiments in mice showed that circular RNA designed for melanoma could significantly inhibit tumor growth in mice compared with untreated mice. This indicates that circRNA can be used as a therapeutic vaccine to induce strong cellular immunity and eliminate tumors. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Compared with linear mRNA products, circular RNA products have several major advantages. First, circular RNA is more stable and easier to store than linear mRNA. This is because of its structural characteristics, linear mRNA is easy to transport It is degraded by RNase during storage, delivery, etc., so it must be cryopreserved and cold-chain transported. Even if linear mRNA is subjected to a series of modifications such as nucleotide modification, the cost and effect are still not ideal, while circular RNA can be It can be stored at room temperature for about a month and can be frozen and thawed repeatedly. Secondly, circRNA is safer than linear RNA. Research shows that natural circRNA molecules show lower immunogenicity and cytotoxicity. Thirdly, circRNA is safer than linear RNA. RNA-like RNA has the ability to produce prolonged antigens and can induce a long-lasting immune response in the body, thus promoting the production of more antibodies and longer-lasting immune protection. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Therefore, circRNA products are expected to become a better choice in the field of RNA therapy for various refractory diseases such as viral infections, tumors, pathogenic bacterial infections, autoimmune diseases, metabolic diseases, etc. play a greater role in disease prevention and treatment. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Has received huge investments&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Inspired by the great success of mRNA vaccines, some scientists around the world who are engaged in pioneering research on circRNA have also established a number of A circular RNA company was founded, and it quickly became favored and sought after by capital. Some biopharmaceutical giants have also joined the trend of developing circular RNA pharmaceutical products, hoping to take the initiative in future competition. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Daniel Anderson of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and others founded Orna Therapeutics in 2019. The company’s pipeline products mainly include anti-tumor and anti-infection drugs. and circular RNA therapies for the treatment of genetic diseases, but they are all in the early stages of development. The company plans to launch the first clinical trial in 2024. In February 2021 and August 2022, Orna completed Series A and Series B financing of US$80 million and US$220 million respectively. Merck, a pharmaceutical giant with a history of 130 years, seems to be very optimistic about this startup. It has paid an advance payment of US$150 million and plans to jointly develop circular RNA therapies for infectious diseases with Orna Company, while injecting US$100 million to participate. Received Orna’s Series B financing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Laronde was founded by Flagship Pioneering with an investment of US$50 million on May 11, 2021. It received US$440 million in financing three months later, making it the largest environmental investment company so far. This is the largest financing ever received by an RNA company. Since the flagship Pioneer Company once incubated the RNA vaccine star company Moderna of the United States, Lloyd&#39;s Company is also known as &quot;Modena 2.0&quot;. After receiving huge financing, the company is focusing on preventive and therapeutic circular RNA product development and clinical trials. However, on June 12, 2023, a joint investigation report released by the Boston Globe and STAT showed that the company was suspected of falsifying preclinical experimental data. For example, the circular RNA it developed for weight loss drugs only worked in mice. Expression, but not in monkeys. In a subsequent statement, the company also admitted the data fraud designed in the above report and dealt with the relevant responsible persons. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yuanhao Zhang of MIT founded Orbital Therapeutics in September 2022 with Drew Weisman, pioneer of mRNA vaccine technology and winner of the 2023 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, and others. ) company, which completed a Series A financing of up to US$270 million in April 2023. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;China also has a number of start-up companies developing circRNA drugs. Circode Bio was founded in September 2018 by researcher Wang Zefeng of the Max Planck Institute of Computing Technology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and others. It is the world&#39;s first start-up company to develop nucleic acid drugs based on circular RNA. In December 2021, Huanma Biotech completed Pre-A round financing of more than 20 million US dollars, and in August 2023, it completed another tens of millions of US dollars in Series A financing. At present, the company has reached a research and development cooperation agreement with the American pharmaceutical giant Pfizer to jointly develop circular RNA therapies. Yuanyin Biotech was founded by Professor Wei Wensheng of Peking University and others in April 2021. In June 2022, it successfully completed a Series A financing of more than 280 million yuan. Together with the angel round and Pre-A round of financing, the company has accumulated more than 400 million yuan. The company&#39;s R&amp;D pipeline includes circRNA products for the treatment of infectious diseases, metabolic diseases and tumors. Among them, the fastest-growing product is the circRNA COVID-19 vaccine, which has completed preclinical trials and entered clinical trials. However, due to the global COVID-19 The epidemic has calmed down, and it is expected that the development of the new crown vaccine may be shelved. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, overall, the current research on circRNA therapy has just begun. To achieve what one start-up company predicts, circRNA will start a revolution or achieve 100 therapeutic goals within ten years. The promise of a new drug project still has a long way to go. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 04 Nov 2023 15:25:06 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[又见哄抢，还要纵容？？丨快评]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259965]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-04 15:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Recently, Chinese medicinal materials grown by a farmer in Huaiyang District, Zhoukou City, Henan Province were robbed by local villagers, once again causing Internet extremes Big attention. Not long ago, there was an incident of villagers robbing corn in the city. On a wider scale, such incidents of theft and robbery of large growers are common on the Internet. This is closely related to the fact that the place where the incident occurred deliberately downplayed the illegal nature of the villagers&#39; looting and condoned the villagers&#39; infringement of the rights and interests of agricultural investors. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the robbery of Chinese medicinal materials in Zhoukou attracted attention, the Huaiyang District Agriculture and Rural Affairs Bureau issued a situation report on November 1, saying that the incident was not a robbery, but the villagers &quot;mistakenly believed&quot; that the growers had harvested for the second time. After finishing, he went into the field to pick up medicinal materials. The growers called the police after trying to dissuade them to no avail. The police quickly arrived at the scene and &quot;persuaded&quot; the people to leave. The report also said that after the second harvest of medicinal materials is completed, it is &quot;a habit for many years&quot; for growers to allow villagers to pick up leftover medicinal materials in the fields. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Pick up&quot;, &quot;years of habit&quot; and &quot;mistake&quot; are cliches that can be seen in almost every incident where growers are robbed. Half a month ago, after the corn robbery incident in Dancheng County, Zhoukou City, the local Agriculture and Rural Affairs Bureau responded that &quot;people went to harvested plots to pick up corn.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These excuses are really ridiculous. Even if there is a local habit of &quot;picking up&quot;, even if the growers allow the villagers to pick up after the second harvest is completed, the growers have repeatedly blocked the looting. If the farmers turn a blind eye and don&#39;t hear, is this still &quot;allowed&quot; by the growers? Is this still legal &quot;picking&quot;? In the Dancheng County corn robbery incident, hundreds of villagers also ignored the growers&#39; obstruction and ran to the unharvested plots in front of the harvesters to &quot;pick up&quot; them, forcing the harvesters to stop working to avoid accidental injuries. Is this still traditional &quot;picking up&quot;? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the case of Gushi County public officials driving patrol cars to steal sorghum, the growers had not yet harvested the sorghum. This cannot be excused by &quot;picking up&quot;, right? But in the eyes of some local people, cutting a few ears of sorghum is not a big deal. &quot;Rural people just like to take advantage of themselves.&quot; Patrols are arranged to avoid safety accidents, not to stop theft. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When local officials faced the looting incident, they not only downplayed it in words and justified large-scale looting, but also in action. Whether it was the robbery of Chinese medicinal materials in Huaiyang or the robbery of corn in Dancheng, after the growers called the police and reported it to the government, the police arrived only to &quot;maintain order&quot; and &quot;persuade&quot; the villagers to leave. What order should be maintained? Do we still need the police to maintain order and escort during looting? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;How to characterize looting behavior? Article 268 of the Criminal Law stipulates that if a crowd is gathered to rob public or private property, the amount is relatively large or there are other serious circumstances, the ringleaders and active participants shall be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of not more than three years, criminal detention or surveillance, and shall also be fined; if the amount is huge or there are other special circumstances, If the circumstances are serious, the offender shall be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of not less than three years but not more than ten years, and shall also be fined. The standards for relatively large amounts and huge amounts shall be determined by each high court. According to the standards of the Shanghai High Court, robbery of property worth more than 4,000 yuan is considered a &quot;large amount&quot;, and more than 40,000 yuan is a &quot;huge amount.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The crime of gathering a crowd to rob property will only punish ringleaders and active participants. For ordinary participants, if they cannot be convicted, administrative penalties can also be imposed. The Public Security Administration Punishment Law stipulates that those who rob public or private property shall be detained for not less than five days but not more than ten days, and may also be fined not more than five hundred yuan; if the circumstances are serious, they shall be detained for not less than ten days but not more than fifteen days, and may also be fined not more than five hundred yuan. the following fines. For those who do not rob but steal, the provisions of the Criminal Law and the Public Security Administration Punishment Law on theft can be applied. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But in reality, the police often give a wide berth to these acts of robbery and theft. A few years ago, a melon farmer in Zhejiang had all 30,000 kilograms of watermelons stolen overnight. After investigation, the police determined that the melon pickers had mistakenly believed the rumor that &quot;the melon grower didn&#39;t want them any more.&quot; There was no theft. Based on the subjective intention, it was determined that it did not constitute theft, but was just a &quot;civil dispute&quot;, and the melon farmers were required to claim compensation through civil procedures. The watermelons grown by a melon farmer in Xi&#39;an, Shaanxi Province were also robbed by villagers. The village branch secretary said that the villagers &quot;believed the rumors.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If &quot;listening to rumors&quot; can be a reason for acquittal, then there is no illegal crime. If you want to steal something, just spread some &quot;rumors&quot;, and then you can steal it without hesitation. Is there such a ridiculous thing in the world? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some people defended the villagers on the grounds that the local farmers were old and helpless and had no means of living. These reasons are also untenable. Even if you encounter difficulties in your own life, you should go to the government to report the problem instead of grabbing other people&#39;s property. In fact, these excuses are completely imaginary excuses. Most of the villagers who participated in the looting were not in a state of poverty. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In recent years, similar incidents of robbery and theft have occurred frequently in many places. It must be said that they are related to the shielding, excuse and connivance of the local government and local police. After the incident, the local government only &quot;persuaded&quot; those who participated in the looting to hand back the looted property without punishing them. Even if some people refused to hand it back, nothing would happen. Of course, the robber will not stop, he will continue to rob next time, and he will not hand it back again. On the contrary, if after an incident, the relevant departments punish decisively, detain when they should be detained, sentence when they should be sentenced, and kill the chicken to scare the monkey, will anyone dare to rob it in the future? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2014, in Zhangzhou, Fujian, fish farmers from other places were robbed of fish by local villagers. The local police promptly filed a case and detained three villagers who participated in serious fish robbery and urged others to do so. The participating villagers &quot;surrendered&quot; and &quot;returned the stolen goods.&quot; Clearly declaring that looting is illegal and subject to legal penalties, and that the items stolen are &quot;stolen goods&quot; and must be returned, is the correct way to deal with this type of looting. Only in this way can we establish and maintain a good local business environment, attract more agricultural investment, and revitalize the countryside. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 04 Nov 2023 15:25:06 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[中国工商银行原副行长张红力接受审查调查]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259971]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-04 15:08:23&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;span>; Zhang Hongli, former member of the Party Committee and Vice President of the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, is suspected of serious violations of discipline and law and is currently under investigation by the Central Committee Disciplinary review and supervisory investigation by the National Commission for Discipline Inspection and Supervision. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color: orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https: //feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 04 Nov 2023 15:25:06 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[秋季以来持续偏暖影响几何？会是暖冬吗？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259961]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-04 14:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Since this autumn, temperatures have continued to be high in most parts of my country, and winter has been delayed in many places. Many members of the public have questions: Will this year be a mild winter? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At a press conference held by the China Meteorological Administration on the 3rd, Jia Xiaolong, deputy director of the National Climate Center, introduced that the national average temperature in October was 12.2°C, 1.6°C higher than the same period in normal years, and the highest temperature in the same period since 1961. Highest. Most of Northeast China, most of Shandong, most of Inner Mongolia, most of Xinjiang and other places were 2°C to 4°C higher. The temperatures in Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang, Tianjin and Liaoning were all the highest for the same period in history. The daily highest temperatures at 140 national weather stations exceeded October’s historical extreme value. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Since this autumn, the mid-to-high latitudes of Eurasia have been dominated by zonal circulation. my country has been controlled by positive anomalies in the height field. The intensity of the Siberian High has been generally weak, and cold air activity has been weak, resulting in persistent temperatures in most parts of my country. It’s on the high side,” Jia Xiaolong said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Experts said that high temperatures and weak cold air will have a certain impact on the development of fog and haze weather and agricultural production. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Recently, fog and haze weather has occurred in Huanghuai and other places in North China. Zhang Jiancheng, deputy director of the National Meteorological Center, analyzed that the main reason is that the zonal circulation has been dominated over North China recently and the cold air is weak. North China, Huanghuai and other places are located in the weak pressure field behind the high pressure, and southerly winds have prevailed for a long time. At the same time, accompanied by high humidity atmosphere, vertical temperature inversion structure and special topographic effects of the Taihang Mountains and Yanshan Mountains, the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region has continued to Severe fog and haze weather. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although winter has already begun in most of Northeast China, northwestern North China, and most of northwest China, the onset of winter in most of the above-mentioned areas is later than normal, and in some areas it is more than 5 days later. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Jia Xiaolong said that warm and hot weather may lead to low soil moisture, affecting crop emergence and growth, which is not conducive to spring plowing and sowing in the coming year; delaying winter may affect crop growth seasons and cycles, which is not conducive to agricultural production plans and Yield; warm and hot climates can easily lead to excessive growth of crops and are conducive to the overwintering and reproduction of pests and diseases. Severe winter rain and snow disasters and increased risks of pests and diseases in the coming year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Does the continued warmness mean that this year will be a mild winter? What impact will El Niño have on the climate this winter? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The National Climate Center issued a climate prediction bulletin on the 3rd, stating that the temperature in most parts of my country this winter will be close to or higher than normal for the same period of the year. The temperature has obvious phase characteristics, with the first winter being warmer and the latter winter close to normal. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Whether it is a warm winter depends on whether the temperature can reach the warm winter standard.” Jia Xiaolong said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Monitoring shows that the equatorial central and eastern Pacific Ocean has entered an El Niño state, and an El Niño event is about to form. Affected by this, abnormal anticyclonic circulation prevails in the lower troposphere over the northwest Pacific and South China Sea in winter, the East Asian trough is weak, the East Asian winter monsoon is weak, and temperatures in most central and eastern my country are higher than normal for the same period. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the other hand, the abnormal anticyclonic circulation is conducive to the transport of warm and moist water vapor from the tropics to the south of my country. In conjunction with the movement of cold air southward, it is easy to cause excessive precipitation in the southern region. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Statistics show that in the context of El Niño events, winter temperatures fluctuate greatly, and the number of cold air events that affect our country is often high. It is recommended to pay close attention to the possible adverse effects of periodic low-temperature rain and snow weather processes.&quot; Jia Xiaolong said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 04 Nov 2023 14:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[贫困大学生哭诉助学金被挤占：福利如何才能落到需要的人手里？丨快评]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259963]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-04 13:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Recently, a video of poor college students crying about being squeezed out of their scholarship qualifications has been widely circulated on social networks. attracted great attention. Tianjin Sino-German University of Applied Sciences, which was involved in the incident, said on November 2 that it had set up a special work team to conduct investigation and verification as soon as possible. The subsequent investigation results will be handled in accordance with regulations and announced in a timely manner. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the video posted online, a boy said that his father died and his mother married when he was young, and his grandfather also passed away when he was 18 years old. Now he only has his grandma as a relative. Their family is registered locally. poor households. After entering college, he received national scholarships in previous years, but this year, the class held a scholarship qualification selection, and he was not selected. The students who were selected were wearing real AJ sneakers (a sneaker brand owned by Nike, the price Not cheap), using Apple 14 Pro Max mobile phone and iPad Pro tablet, often having dinner parties and traveling. He reported the situation to the counselor, but was forced to move out of the dormitory. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If this is true, it is really outrageous, and this video has attracted a lot of attention. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In reality, fraud in scholarship applications is nothing new in some colleges and universities. National scholarships for colleges and universities are financial aid provided by the state finance to college students with financial difficulties. They are mainly used to meet the living expenses of students. The average aid standard is 3,000 yuan per person per year (not equal, can be divided into 2-3 levels), about 20% students may receive financial aid. Bursaries are a benefit provided by the state to some poor college students. Since it is welfare, how to distribute it and how to let people who really need it get this money is a very important issue. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to this student, their class’s scholarship qualifications were selected by the whole class because he was not satisfied with the results of the first selection and went to the teacher to report it. As a result, he came last in the second selection. , became the person least qualified to receive scholarships in the class. The whole class selection seems very &quot;reasonable&quot;, but when used here, it is undoubtedly very absurd. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Who is in financial difficulty and who is not is not a matter decided by one person and one vote. If the selection is held, it will become a &quot;connection&quot; competition, and it is inevitable that some students will form gangs and even bribe the vote. As for truly poor students, they may not be able to mingle with better-off classmates due to financial constraints, and as a result, they may not be eligible for financial aid. On social networks, it is not uncommon for a group of people to &quot;unite together&quot; to promote one person to receive a scholarship and treat them to dinner, and then another person will take turns to receive it next time. Such posts are not uncommon. As a result, some colleges and universities have issued notices that award-winning students are not allowed to use their scholarships to treat guests, otherwise their qualifications for future assessments will be cancelled. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some schools and classes even ask students applying for financial aid to tell their situations in front of the whole class and &quot;campaign&quot; for financial aid. This is letting people show their scars for others to see, which may cause a huge blow to the students&#39; self-esteem. Although some students are poor, they do not want others to know, especially in public. After all, poverty is not something worth showing off, and not everyone is compassionate. It is common for students to laugh at poor students in school. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is also not a good idea to let counselors, class teachers, etc. have the decision-making power about scholarship eligibility. First of all, it is difficult to ensure that these people are completely public-minded in the quota allocation process. Maybe most counselors are fair, but it is inevitable that there will be a few who are partial. Sometimes, financial aid eligibility may even become a tool to blackmail students into &quot;obedience.&quot; Secondly, counselors and others may not be able to fully understand the students&#39; financial situation, and lack sufficient and correct information to make correct judgments. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There should be some objective criteria for determining scholarship qualifications, rather than just subjective determination, whether it is the subjectivity of an individual person (identification by the counselor or class teacher) or the subjectivity of the entire class (selection by the whole class) . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What is the objective standard? Theoretically, it can be whether the student&#39;s family income is below a certain standard.但是学生家庭收入和资产情况，学校是无法直接获取的，所以很多学校会让贫困学生提供村委会或居委会的贫困证明。但是这些证明也并不完全可信。一来，这些贫困证明并不一定真实。尤其对不少农村来说，村里学生考上大学，即使家庭并不算特别贫困，但到村委会开一张贫困证明也不是难事，毕竟都是乡里乡亲，一纸证明就可以减轻一下家庭负担，很多村干部都是会给开的，除非家里的收入明显高于全村平均水平。二来，不同地区的贫困标准也不一样，经济发达地区的贫困，和西部地区的贫困，完全是两个概念。近年来，经常有政府官员走访“贫困”群众被吐槽的例子，其中固然有假贫困的，但也有一些确实是地域经济水平差异导致的误解。所以，生源地出具的家庭贫困证明，也只能是一个参考，不应作为决定因素。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;那助学金资格到底应该怎么定？这当然是一个非常复杂的问题，很难做到完全理想。但还是有一些可以参考的标准。比如，可以把申请助学贷款作为一个必要条件。在国家大学生资助政策体系中，助学贷款主要用来解决经济困难学生的学费、住宿费问题。而现在绝大多数学校的学费、住宿费都是远高于助学金标准的。如果学费、住宿费能自己解决了，那就说明不算太贫困，否则完全可以申请助学贷款交学费，把自己的钱留作生活费。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;也可以观察学生在校园内的消费情况。南京理工大学的做法就是一个很好的借鉴。 2016年，南京理工大学通过分析学生在食堂消费的数据，对那些每月在食堂吃饭超过60顿，总消费不超过420元的学生，列为资助对象，直接往饭卡中打钱。这是一个很聪明的做法。众所周知，学校食堂的饭菜要比外面便宜不少。如果一个学生几乎每顿饭都在校内食堂吃，平均每餐的消费也不高，很大概率上，这就是一个贫困学生了。有钱的学生，要么在校内食堂吃得少，经常下馆子叫外卖，要么在食堂消费高，吃得好。吃饭是人的刚需，不论穷富，都要吃饭，所以用饮食消费水平作为衡量标准，可以把所有学生都涵盖在内。而且饮食消费水平难以作假。一个习惯了高标准饮食的人，在经济条件没有变化的情况下，让他一个月几个月时间持续降低饮食标准，是很难的。当然，这种做法也有可能被投机取巧，每顿饭都在食堂吃一点，然后再去外面大吃大喝，但能这样坚持的有钱人，恐怕不多见。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;总之，国家助学金作为一个国家财政为贫困学生提供的福利，应该好钢用在刀刃上，真正为贫困学生减轻生活负担，而不应该成为人人想吃的唐僧肉。天津中德应用技术大学官方声称已经展开了调查，希望调查和处理结果能够公平公正。更重要的，助学金分配不公的问题，在很多高校都有，应该引起所有高校的警惕。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 04 Nov 2023 13:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[当一个盲人想要登上珠峰]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259956]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-04 12:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/03/olqpWxQWEpUrbnUzTSjDFES4jSoUR9IEeffnviOT.jpg&quot;

&lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;攀登过程中，脚下有纵横交错、完全不规则的冰裂缝，张洪需要先用登山杖试探位置和地形，再用脚来回丈量冰裂缝的大概宽度，最后才敢把脚迈出去。&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（受访者供图/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;站上世界最高峰的顶端，盲人张洪的第一个念头是“赶快下去”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“登山的事故，绝大部分是在下山途中出现。”张洪说，登山时，人的重心在前，哪怕摔跤，也有山体阻拦，而下山，“全凭潜意识”。他悬着一颗心，直到回到珠峰大本营，冰爪被脱掉才安然——那意味着危险真正意义上的远离。夏尔巴（注：居住在喜马拉雅山脉两侧的当地人，通常担任向导）给他一杯奶茶、几块饼干充饥。冲顶与返回之路几乎耗尽了他的力气，他几近昏迷。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;时隔两年，声音、听感和触觉构成的认知系统，让他对世界第一峰的回忆仍然鲜明。他清晰感知到不同海拔高度风的差异：低海拔冰川的风夹杂着冷冽的寒气，高海拔的暴风制造巨响，狂风卷起雪粒子、冰渣和小块岩石，给人粘稠的触感，像一堵高墙般让人难以逾越。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;徒步过冰川，脚底的冰块有坚硬的质地，踩上去有类似咬薯片的“咔嚓”声。即便蹬着冰爪，打滑的风险也难以避免。雪地厚实，脚步声被闷在里面，给人更踏实的踏感。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2021年5月24日，在珠穆朗玛峰8848.86米的峰顶，张洪循前人之例留下几张照片和一段15秒的小视频。前者成为他的微信头像，后者则是他“亚洲首位登顶珠峰的盲人”纪录的凭证。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;登顶成功的消息传到范立欣所在的大本营时，这位纪录片导演喜忧参半。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;他为张洪多年的努力得到回报而开心。2019年，他从一个登山的朋友那里听说张洪的宏愿：一位盲人按摩师渴望登上珠峰。身边人一合计都觉得不靠谱，范立欣却对这个人物产生了好奇，赌徒一般地要拍摄这个极有可能失败的故事。2020年5月，纪录片开机，两个“偏执”的人命运自此交汇。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;忧的是，因为氧气出了问题，随行跟拍的两个摄影师没能一起上去，张洪登顶的视频素材是空白，范立欣直呼崩溃，“巧妇难为无米之炊”。2023年10月27日，纪录片《看不见的顶峰》全国公映，范立欣用一段“黑”填补了素材的空白。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“我们拍了360多个小时的素材，剪辑花了一年。剪辑的时候我在想，这一段如果没有素材，不如&#39;将计就计&#39;，用一个黑场和沉浸式的（声音感受），把观众代入到一个盲人的世界里面。”范立欣对南方周末记者说，“用这个黑场带着观众，跟随张洪的脚步一起登上世界之巅。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/03/WivtRGd596cs3s9SoNMddIhhBxMGdd3QSXOa6bhS.jpg&quot;

&lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;张洪和妻子夏琼。&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（受访者供图/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;张洪对登顶珠峰有近乎偏执的渴求。那时，他在西藏的一所医院的中医医疗科做副主任，四十多岁，工作稳定，和妻子共事，还有一个儿子。所有人都对他“疯了”一样要登珠峰感到不解：“这个事完全不靠谱，手里有这么好的工作，稳定下来了，还要去做这个事情，这就是吃饱了撑的。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;张洪承认，执念来源于某种想要证明什么的欲望。“以前自己给自己贴上标签，我是社会上一个不幸的人。但是攀登珠峰的过程，让我学会了一件事：其实我和其他人都是一样的，社会和大自然对我并没有怎么另眼看待。”&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;“珠峰不会因为我是盲人，就给我更多的同情”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;正式拍摄登顶前，范立欣跟拍了张洪一年多。当时，张洪珠峰之行的最大焦虑是钱。纪录片开机时，张洪得到了一个基金会5000美金的支持，但离“小一百万”人民币的缺口还很大。镜头前，张洪借着酒劲，窘迫地和兄弟开口借。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“当时没什么眉目，说实话我也挺焦急的，他如果筹不到钱的话，就是想去也去不了，”范立欣对南方周末记者说，“有可能就变成一个&#39;堂吉诃德&#39;的故事。”后来通过众筹、品牌介入、医院托底，出发前一个星期，张洪才将钱堪堪凑齐。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;张洪走的是攀登珠峰的传统路线。从尼泊尔首都加德满都坐直升机或小型固定翼飞机到卢卡拉小镇，再徒步7天到珠峰大本营，“相当于初期的适应性训练”。在大本营稍事休整后，团队进行了两次拉练。第一次拉练的目的地是6100多米高的罗布切；第二次拉练，则要爬到海拔8300米处的C3营地。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;范立欣此前没爬过山，第一次拉练的罗布切，是他攀登过的第一座山。小时候他的腿部开过刀，膝盖被挖掉了三分之一，难以陪张洪一起攀登珠峰。他请来两名高山摄影师，算上兼任录音师的制片人，团队精简，只有4个人。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;从大本营爬到C1营地，海拔高度上升不多，但要途经被称为“恐怖冰川”的昆布冰川，冰川中遍布沟壕。宽大的冰沟间，两节梯子叠在一起做桥，人和摄像机一起从上面颤颤巍巍经过。饶是常年和珠峰交手的夏尔巴也不能掉以轻心。纪录片拍摄时，一名夏尔巴掉进了冰沟，命悬一线。同队的人费了一番工夫救他上来后，他的身体蜷曲着，耳朵冻得紫红。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;视力正常的登山者可以走一步望十步，张洪只能老老实实盯住眼下的这步。每一步都艰难。每走一步他就在心中默念：“这个雪地又接纳了我，脚下的脚印又承载了我。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/03/WPjpaab7QJy6eKt9fLqo3FPrpOBP9neXcuFCWk76.jpg&quot;

&lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;在珠峰拍摄时，最大的困难是电，因为柴油发电机的柴油需要一点点驼上来，只能靠太阳能充电，但攀登时常常三五天不见太阳，纪录片团队常常感到焦虑。&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（受访者供图/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“珠峰不会因为我是盲人，就给我更多的同情。冰川下面有冰窟窿，旁边是悬崖，梯子同样是摇晃的，不会因为我看不见而降低难度。”张洪第一次登山时，就被类似的感觉击中，“我能感觉到我和所有人一样，在一个同等的、公平的环境下做一件事情，我和所有人之间没有障碍，而不是之前我认为我自己是不幸的、另类的存在”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但因无法视物，攀冰对张洪来说阻碍重重。范立欣介绍，喜马拉雅山脉那年天气恶劣，路况复杂。攀爬冰壁时，视力健全的登山者可以踩在前面人踩过的冰坑上。但张洪看不见，脚下的钢制冰爪难以准确踢进旧坑，要比常人耗费更多力气踢出新坑。在冰壁上挂着时，登山者靠三点支撑，一手拉绳子，一手用冰镐砸冰，使劲把自己的身体往上拉。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“我们能看见，所以大概知道往哪儿砸，会拉得上劲，可是他看不见，他就是乱凿，凿一下，冰飞了就白凿了，就得再凿。爬十几米的冰壁就累得不行。”范立欣观察。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在第一次拉练时，张洪突然发了火，直言不想爬了，要求派直升机来接。同行的队伍里，有人嫌他的步频跟不上进度，拖慢进程，张洪面露不悦。“他跟团队之间是需要磨合的，他会觉得风险太过高了，他倒不是害怕自己出什么事，他最害怕的是还没有真正的攀登呢，只是在拉练就受伤了，或者体力耗尽。”范立欣对南方周末记者说。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“海拔五六千米之上，人的情绪和思维跟我们在平原地区，完全不一样。”张洪分析当时的心态，“如果还没有（正式）攀登，拉练的时候就受伤，就很不值得了。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;第二次拉练时，张洪的胆囊炎发作，痛得五官紧紧拧在一起。回到大本营，营地的医生对他做了一番检查。张洪从旁人那里得知，医生建议把他送回加德满都治疗，“甚至要动手术”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“一旦去治疗，攀登几乎就告吹了。”张洪把自己裹进睡袋，崩溃地哭了出来。“时间不等人，天气不好，窗口期有限，就那么几天。不能因为这点事情，就放弃攀登。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;他责怪自己没有对此做好预案，但又对病痛无计可施，只能尽力揉搓腹部，按摩肝经和胆经。他攀登珠峰，一个原因是为了打破外界对盲人的刻板印象，盲人不只能做按摩这行。但命定般的，按摩两三天后，病状真的缓解了。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“一切都是天意。”他说。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/03/pxIY9yIS7ks79vnYsbBCixImw9AWvHoKHvS1nygy.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;641&quot;

&lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;登顶&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;冲顶时刻在2021年5月23日晚上七点到来。张洪、中方向导、摄影师以及夏尔巴从C4营地出发向珠峰顶进发。离峰顶只有100米时，意外出现了。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;恶劣的天气冻坏了所有人的氧气调节阀，导致氧气泄漏。大家一合计，现有的氧气量难以支持所有人登顶。强子是张洪的中方向导，有过15年的高山向导经验，但从未登顶过珠峰。对登山爱好者来说，2小时就能攀完的那100米，是个“巨大的诱惑”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;强子最终决定把自己的氧气让出来，两位摄影师做出同样决定，三人下撤，由夏尔巴陪同张洪一个人登顶。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;范立欣后来问及放弃原因。强子说，和张洪认识三四年里，一路见证他的不易和委屈。“我是真心不愿意让他再走一趟，可能他这辈子也不会再有第二次机会再走了。训练、筹钱，顶住周围社会的舆论，亲戚朋友的质疑——你看不见，冒这么大的险干什么？大家不会想到说一个盲人也有权利去实现自己的理想，去追寻自己的人生价值，同时也为这个家里争口气。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;三个夏尔巴和张洪连在一根绳上，张洪推上升器前进。一个夏尔巴在约1.5米前引路，两人语言不通，只靠简单的英语词汇“go”“up”“down”交流。还有两个夏尔巴在后面背着氧气，其中一个夏尔巴偶尔拍拍他的腿，“表示安慰和鼓励”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;登顶前，最难的一段路程是“希拉里台阶”，那是一片刃状山脊，岩壁几近垂直，连“雪都挂不住”。张洪预估，窄处大概仅30公分，仅能容留下半只脚。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;手在这时成了他的眼睛。他一只手支撑，另一只手顺着脚尖往前探路，找到下一步的脚落点后，再靠另一只手寻找支撑点，每迈一步，“得停下来休息好久好久”。张洪形容，攀爬希拉里台阶，就像穿梭在他视力尚健全时看过的那种人造假山里，石缝完全不规则，“根本不知道下一步怎么走”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“希拉里台阶”距离峰顶只有12米，却花了张洪两个多小时。攀登时，他一度失去了时间概念，隔一段时间就左右摇晃绳子，询问领路的夏尔巴：“How long? How long?”夏尔巴的回答每次都是半小时。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“结果过了好几个半个小时还没到。也许我过了5分钟就问还有多久，过了10分钟又问。”张洪有点焦急，说了几次“不行”“我要死了”“我要下去”。起先夏尔巴并未理会他的抱怨，最后一次夏尔巴也被弄生气了，带着情绪同意了张洪要放弃的请求，转身准备帮他解掉上升器，换上下降器。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/03/FZaEOpaZ1qtetpzFuojXRkKa8TGvXX6nZFA75asj.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;586&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/03/FZaEOpaZ1qtetpzFuojXRkKa8TGvXX6nZFA75asj.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256988&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;范立欣回忆，那一年印度洋有两三个大的气旋，导致珠峰下大雪刮大风，张洪登顶那天，风速达到每小时60公里，人几乎要被吹倒，如果衣服划破、羽绒飞掉，后果将是“瞬间失温死掉”。&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（受访者供图/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;不甘的情绪攫住了张洪，他对夏尔巴说：“Go! Go! Go! ”“继续走。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;爬着爬着，张洪突然感觉冰爪踩上了一处软软的雪地，越往前走越觉得踩感厚实，直至积雪深得能将整只脚掌覆盖。他一下子撞上了前面人的背包。“You summit（你登顶了）。”他听见领路的夏尔巴转过头对他说。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“我并没有以为真的登顶了。”张洪回忆，“我也不知道走到哪里，反正就是这样走。可能是因为太累，还没能从&#39;走一步算一步&#39;的专注度里反应过来。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;他的感官先于意识捕捉到了周边环境的变化。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;上山时，张洪无形中感知到，正在攀爬的山体，像一个巨大的障碍挡在面前。但在那一刻，障碍感消失了。他听出周围变得空旷，一览无余的那种空旷。他把头往左转了转，又往右转了转，仔细听了听周围的声音，风声剧烈地在他的头上打转，听得他“毛骨悚然”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;他们在珠峰顶上停留时间不长，张洪听见夏尔巴说，“Photo, photo”，快速了留了几张影，下了山才知道，还拍了认证视频。他后来告诉范立欣，只听到对讲机里一直窜着各种听不懂的语言。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“他想起那个瞬间，甚至是有一点可笑，他准备了那么多年，准备了很多姿势、豪言壮语要在珠峰上说一下，什么都没有，就2秒钟，他就醒悟过来说，赶紧往下，这个地方太可怕了，就像地狱一样，那个风声呼号。”范立欣回忆，“他以前失明的时候，真的觉得世界崩塌，就像在地狱里一样。他说我爬了20年，从地狱里爬到平地上，再从平地爬到珠峰顶。（到了峰顶）感觉好像又到了地狱一样，于是赶紧往山下下。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;结束攀登后，他们被新一轮新冠疫情困在尼泊尔。那阵子，正是外部最喧腾的时候，范立欣统计过，包括BBC、法新社在内七十余家国际主流媒体都在报道他。张洪说，自己当时并未沉浸在被聚光灯照着的感觉中。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“他爬完珠峰以后才发现，登顶珠峰根本不是他所需要的高光时刻，而是让他明白了，当下的这一步是最重要的。因为这一步没有踩好，可能就掉下去，人就没了，根本没有什么所谓的高光时刻。真正的高光时刻有可能在你最危险的时刻才刚开始，电影里面的向导也说了：登顶不是终点，回到家里才是终点。”在尼泊尔时，范立欣和他聊天，“他说，你现在告诉我我现在站的地方就是珠峰顶，我也相信，因为我看不见”。&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;他想让别人觉得，盲人不只会做按摩师&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;刚开始拍摄张洪时，范立欣觉得他是个有些急躁的人，调试设备或更换电池的空隙，张洪会显得有些焦躁。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;急躁来源于他的突然失明。21岁那年，一次青光眼发作，他永久性丧失了视力。花了三四年时间，张洪尝试接受看不见这件事，性格也因此发生改变，他变得“情绪崩溃”“脾气暴躁”，要拿的东西没拿到，或者无意间碰翻了杯子都会展露急躁的一面。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;妻子夏琼柔软地接住了这些瞬间。她有一次试着换位思考丈夫的处境，把自己关在屋子里，熄灭全部的灯，闭紧窗户，“感觉四面墙都向你挤压过来”。她体会到丈夫身处未知的环境里，那种对危险的紧张感。“本来是很温顺的一只羊，自由的物种，突然间被困在一个看不见的黑色牢笼里。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;张洪小时候的成长环境，和“盲”紧密黏连。他的父亲和叔叔都是盲人，视力健全的他有时充当“盲杖”，三人拉一根竹竿，张洪就在前面领路。遇上雨天，路面滑湿，张洪摔倒，连着父亲和叔叔一起摔跤。在农村社会，他很早就感知到了盲人的境遇。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“我从小知道他们的生活，想到自己以后也要生活在这样的环境里面，就没有办法接受。”张洪说。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;夏琼察觉到，家庭背景和童年记忆，在张洪内心生出一种自我防御机制。结婚前，张洪从未和她主动谈起过父亲和叔叔的情况。他们结识于张洪还能和世界目光交错时，后来张洪失明，她调侃说，自己是被金庸的武侠小说给“害”了，侠肝义胆地觉得，“不应该让他一个人孤零零的没人管”。1999年，相恋3年的两人决定扯证。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;家族长辈们众口一致地反对，父亲在夏琼面前哭了出来。张洪承诺她：“我一定会让你家里人对你刮目相看。”她想，也许是从那个时候起，为丈夫之后的“不断折腾”埋下了伏笔。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在西藏安定下来前的二十年里，夏琼形容他们的生活是“风雨飘摇”。张洪在学校里学的专业是推拿，但并不醉心于此。失明后，专业反而救了他，让他不至于吃不上饭。夏琼也学了推拿。夫妻俩先是在成都当按摩师，日子过得“苟且偷生”。后来去上海的按摩店里打工，两人水平能排到“店里的前一二名”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2005年，夏琼回家待产，收到张洪从上海寄来的保健品，她知道丈夫又“折腾”了。张洪背着她把工作辞了，去干销售。“他有时候跟人家讲，他在上海一个人在地铁里面找不到出路，被困在地铁里面，在上海的马路上被困在十字路口。”夏琼说，“他是想要让别人觉得盲人不单单只会做按摩师，还会做别的。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2019年，登上7500多米的慕士塔格峰后，张洪决定为登珠峰做准备。为了节省开销，他采用了最经济划算的训练方式——爬楼梯。爬的同时穿上高山靴，戴阻氧面罩，同时负重二十多公斤，每天爬三四个小时。他住在医院的公寓楼，每天从一楼爬到十二楼，再坐电梯下来。碰见医院的同事，他感受到压力，“身边无数人质疑，觉得这哥们不但瞎了，还疯了。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;忍受身边人的异样眼光和筹措不到资金的困局，无数次，他坐上电梯后，手指在一层和自己家所在的层数犹豫、徘徊，“一直这样纠结了两年”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“有的人可能会觉得让妻子温饱，儿女有钱读书就可以；有的人觉得要给孩子一个榜样，让爱的人在人前人后脸上都有光。”夏琼说，丈夫张洪“可能是后者”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;张洪成功登顶珠峰后，一些细微的变化隐然发生。从前医院里的人提起张洪，是“夏医生的老公”，如今，他们称呼她为“张洪的太太”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;儿子两岁时，夏琼和一位亲戚关掉灯，在一片黑黢黢中问儿子：天黑了，你要保护谁？两岁的儿子奶乎乎地说：保护爸爸。夏琼和女亲戚百思不得其解：我们都是女性，为什么要保护爸爸？儿子想都不想地说：因为爸爸看不见。如今，儿子觉得爸爸“很可以”“比较强大”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;范立欣和夏琼都观察到，攀登珠峰成功之后，生活中的张洪变得松弛许多。失明之后，他曾一度难以接受弱人一等的感受。他和每一个普通人一样有自己的缺点，但他宁愿听到平视的批评，也不要俯视的褒奖。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“攀登珠峰之前，我在外面那么多年，从来不跟别人讲起我家人的事情，只有我老婆知道，除此之外没有第三个人知道，但是珠峰下来以后，我可以跟任何人分享我家里发生的任何事情，包括我爸爸、叔叔看不见，以前我是没有办法面对，现在我可以从容地面对这些事情。”张洪说。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;获取更多RSS：&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 04 Nov 2023 12:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[“制造业当家关键在于人”]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259951]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-04 11:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;In 2008, Hu Xiaoyan was elected as the first batch of migrant workers to the National People&#39;s Congress.

In order to pay off the foreign debt of more than 20,000 yuan owed by her family, she decided to leave her hometown of Guang&#39;an, Sichuan and embark on the furthest journey in her life. A trip - to work in Guangdong. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;35 years later, Hu Xiaoyan is already the full-time vice chairman of Foshan Sanshui District Federation of Industry and Commerce. On October 25, 2023, at the third &quot;Storytelling Meeting on the 45th Anniversary of Reform and Opening Up&quot;, she recalled the years when she first arrived in Guangdong to work hard. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In ten years, Hu Xiaoyan rose from a female assembly line worker in an electronics factory to the management of a ceramic production workshop, and was selected as one of the &quot;Top Ten Migrant Workers in Foshan&quot;. In 2008, for the first time, three representatives of the migrant workers group participated in the National Two Sessions, including Hu Xiaoyan from Guangdong, a major labor import province. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Since the reform and opening up, the &quot;tide of migrant workers&quot; has promoted China&#39;s industrialization and urbanization process. Guangdong is a major labor importer. In 1988 alone, the number of laborers from other provinces who came to work reached about 3 million. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The event was hosted by the Information Office of the Guangdong Provincial Government. In addition to Hu Xiaoyan, Shang Xiaodong, a second-level researcher at the South China Sea Institute of Oceanography, Chinese Academy of Sciences, and a mechanical technician from Guangdong Province were also invited College teacher Yang Denghui tells his story. The three people are from different generations and backgrounds, but what they have in common is that they are all foreign talents from Guangdong. Shang Xiaodong was admitted to Taiyuan Institute of Technology (now Taiyuan University of Technology) after the resumption of the college entrance examination. He entered graduate school at the age of 32. In 2005, he came to Guangdong to research physical ocean research. Yang Denghui, who was born in 1997, is the champion of the CNC milling project of the World Skills Competition. He studied at the Guangdong Mechanical Technician College and was elected as a representative of the 14th National People&#39;s Congress. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;On October 26, 2023, workers at an agricultural science and technology enterprise in Yunfu City were cultivating flower seedlings.

This trend continues today. According to the National Bureau of Statistics, the number of migrant workers was 78.49 million at the beginning of the century, and the total number in 2022 exceeded 295 million. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Guangdong occupies three of the four major special economic zones identified in 1979, which has created a huge demand for labor. Hu Xiaoyan thus joined the ranks heading south. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The emergence of migrant workers has also highlighted the problem of migrant workers. In 2006, relevant documents from the State Council mentioned that there were problems such as low wages and arrears for migrant workers, and many occupational diseases and work-related injuries. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In January 2008, Yang Chengyong, deputy director of the Election Committee of the Standing Committee of the Guangdong Provincial People&#39;s Congress, revealed to the media that Guangdong, as the province with the largest influx of migrant population, planned to elect After six migrant workers were elected as representatives to the Provincial People&#39;s Congress, one migrant worker was elected as a deputy to the National People&#39;s Congress. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Before that, Guangdong had been at the forefront in protecting the political rights of migrant workers. In 2000, four outsiders were elected during the general election of the Shenzhen Municipal People’s Congress. Representatives of migrant workers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In the end, Hu Xiaoyan became the first batch of migrant workers to be a deputy to the National People&#39;s Congress, but before that, she had never served as a deputy to any people&#39;s congress at the township, county, city, or province levels. Hu Xiaoyan recalled to Southern Weekend reporters: &quot;I don&#39;t find it difficult because I already live among them (migrant workers).&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Hu Xiaoyan mentioned To: &quot;The first batch of migrant workers to represent the National People&#39;s Congress became the most eye-catching label on me. From then on, I began to learn how to conduct research, write suggestions, speak, and learn how to perform my duties.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style= &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;After becoming a deputy to the National People&#39;s Congress, she used her vacation time to visit workers and put forward suggestions including criminalizing unpaid wages, connecting with medical insurance, off-site college entrance examinations, and housing benefits. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;At almost the same time, national policies also shifted to consider the new needs generated by migrant workers entering cities. Hu Xiaoyan once suggested “allowing the children of migrant workers to take the college entrance examination in the workplace.” At the end of 2013, Guangdong Province officially announced the implementation measures for the college entrance examination for migrant children in other places. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Today, more &quot;Hu Xiaoyans&quot; have become deputies to the National People&#39;s Congress.

It&#39;s just that it&#39;s much older. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The turning point occurred in 1978. Shang Xiaodong heard that his high school classmates were admitted to college, and he began to prepare for the exam. In the second year, he relied on self-study and was admitted to the physics teaching class of the Department of Physics Basics of Taiyuan Institute of Technology. After graduation, he was assigned to serve as a teacher at the Command College of the Chinese People&#39;s Armed Police Force. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;More than ten years later, he keenly discovered that there were more masters around him, and he felt that &quot;if you don&#39;t study, you will fall behind.&quot; After completing his postgraduate studies in the Department of Mechanics of Tianjin University, he went to Hong Kong, China and the United States for further studies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In 2005, Shang Xiaodong came to Guangdong and entered the South China Sea Institute of Oceanography, Chinese Academy of Sciences. Previously, Guangdong had just issued the “Decision on Accelerating the Construction of a Strong Science and Technology Province.” &quot;There is a good scientific research atmosphere here, and there is a passion for pioneering and bold attempts. This is why our family chose to take root in Guangdong.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Just returned to China At that time, ocean observation instruments had long been monopolized by foreign countries, so Shang Xiaodong decided to lead his team to independently develop ocean observation instruments. In the end, the team developed the &quot;fast temperature sensor for ocean detection&quot; with the fastest response in the world, with a response time of 7 milliseconds. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Under the policy of &quot;strengthening the province through science and technology&quot;, Guangdong also hopes to solve the problem of &quot;two skins&quot; between technology and economy. Empowering new manufacturing industries with new technologies focuses on the integration of technological innovation and industry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Yang Denghui said that after enrolling in a technician college in 2014, he &quot;competed with things thinner than a hair every day.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Yang Denghui, who was born as a technician, saw the new demand for talents behind the &quot;manufacturing industry&quot;. “The key to success in the manufacturing industry lies in people.” He believes that in addition to scientific research talents like Shang Xiaodong, it also needs a large number of highly skilled talents to support it. This is an important reason why he chose to stay in Guangdong Mechanical Technician College to teach. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;After entering the school, Yang Denghui was selected into the training team preparing for the 43rd World Skills Competition. The training project was CNC milling, which is an automatic processing technology that uses computers. Drawing and programming realize part machining. At that time, China had not won a gold medal in this event. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;If you want to achieve success in CNC milling projects, you must practice &quot;knife skills&quot;: choose appropriate tools according to different materials and production requirements of the parts, and strictly control them The accuracy of parts and components is controlled within 0.02 mm. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In 2017, Yang Denghui, who started his career again, won the CNC milling championship at the 44th World Skills Competition. He was only 20 years old that year. After graduation, he joined the technical education team, and the students he guided won the world championship gold medal in this project again in 2019 and 2022. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Data from the Guangdong Provincial Department of Human Resources and Social Security show that currently, the total number of skilled talents in Guangdong is 18.5 million, including 6.31 million highly skilled talents.

About 5 minutes later, The two woke up. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At this time, Liu Tiezhu, the project manager who was walking to the entrance of the central water pump room at +290m, felt a large fluctuation in the wind flow, and saw a lot of dust in the wind flow in the direction of Dongyi Shimen, so he went After checking, they saw the injured Lu Xiang, Gao Cai and Guo Wensheng respectively (Gao Cai and Guo Wensheng were seriously burned), and heard Leng Jun&#39;s voice at Mikami Pass, and then returned and took Lu Xiang to the +290m water pump room, and Call the dispatch office to report the incident. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&lt;span>;Accident rescue process&lt;/span>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;After receiving the accident report, dispatcher Meng Fanjun reported the accident to mine director Li Yonghai. Yonghai immediately reported the situation to mine investor Wang Haoming and legal representative Cong Peifu, and arranged for Li Tao and Huo Jianguo to organize personnel to go down the mine to carry out rescue. Rescuers met survivors such as Lu Xiang, Zhang Chengxue, Ji Yaomin, Guo Wensheng, Huang Fujun and Zhang Yong, and sent people to escort them to the well. At the same time, a person (Yang Lianpeng) was found buried in coal at the fan switch, with only one leg exposed. He was confirmed dead at the scene. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The rescuers found a fall at the Sishang Pass. They checked that the carbon monoxide concentration on the inside of the Sishang Pass was 999ppm (portable multi-function detector range 0~999ppm), the gas concentration was 0.1%, and the oxygen concentration was 5%. All people on the mountain were believed to have died, and the search for rescuers continued. When we reached the Sanshang Pass, coal fell and blocked the roadway. We found 4 people calling for help in Sanshang Mountain. We immediately cleared the coal and entered Sanshang Mountain to rescue the seriously injured Gao Cai and Li Junsheng. Then we lifted out Zhang Qinglong, who could not stand on his right leg, and finally Rescue Leng Jun and escort him to the surface. At 18:10, all survivors had reached the ground and were sent to hospitals for treatment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At 18:40, rescue workers began to clear the pile of coal where Yang Lianpeng died, and pulled out the body and transported it to the ground. Then the carbon monoxide was discharged section by section up the mountain. When the discharge reached 13 meters from the mountain pass, the deceased Wang Hongchang was found. The gas continued to be discharged, and the victims Wang Junfu and Sun Cheng were found about 1 meter below the shelter. So far, all the bodies of the victims have been found and transported to the ground. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&lt;span>;Direct reasons&lt;/span>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;+290m East Shimensi Mountain is connected to the +355m goaf area, and gas surges in the goaf area out; a local ventilator was used to supply air to three working locations at the same time.

Four workers who felt unwell were sent to Tonghua City Hospital for inhalation. Oxygen therapy. Wang Zhenshan sent the four victims to the Jiangyuan District Cemetery Funeral Home, Jiangyuan District Ni Tai Hospital, Sanchazi Forestry Bureau Hospital Morgue, and Textile Factory Funeral Home, and reached a compensation agreement with the families of the victims. Subsequently, he purchased two &quot;Resident Death Medical Certificates (Inference)&quot; (hereinafter referred to as &quot;Death Certificates&quot;) from Wang Yonghai, director of the textile factory funeral home, for 50,000 yuan each, resulting in the illegal disposal of the remains of the two deceased persons. At the same time, Wang Zhenshan arranged for personnel to delete video surveillance data related to the accident on the afternoon of April 5, deliberately concealing the accident. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At around 2:00 on April 3, after the on-site rescue work was completed, Li Yonghai arranged for Guan Yanlin to lead the ventilation team members into the well, and at the original sealed position of +290m East Shimen and +355m return air alley.

(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Halloween has passed, but the &quot;Ten Thousand Stem Festival&quot; has not. This large-scale carnival still has lingering warmth in the metropolis of Shanghai. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;November 1st every year is the traditional Western festival of Halloween. The most lively moment is on Halloween, when children dress up as various cute ghosts, knock on doors and do trick-or-treating. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Halloween in Shanghai in 2023 comes earlier. Starting from October 28, the city switches to the magical side. Major theme parks and some Internet celebrity bars will hold Halloween activities, as well as spontaneous street parties. Monsters and monsters of different shapes appeared on the street. What is unexpected is that Internet memes with a strong Chinese style have suddenly emerged and become popular all over the Internet. They are dubbed as a new trend of &quot;Renaissance&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When the lanterns come on, an ordinary old street can turn into a movable feast. It will be a fairy tale world where you can cosplay various characters and experience another identity; it can be a channel to release stress and express yourself; it can also be a traffic pool full of temptations. The cosplayers in the pool are eye-catching enough, and there are precedents for Xiti’s hot search lists on major platforms, which means that traffic and money will have the opportunity to be included in the bag. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporters interviewed more than a dozen &quot;crazy citizens&quot;. According to them, Shanghai has not been this lively for a long time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;On October 30, the Julu Road area was crowded with people. Visual China&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11 /03/66c8c013f9.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/03/66c8c013f9.jpg &quot; data-key=&quot;256937&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On October 30, the Julu Road area was crowded with people. (Visual China/Photo)&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;Pure happiness&quot; on Julu Road&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;After leaving the subway station, the flow of people under the bright yellow lights was surging in one direction. Even without navigation, you can determine the general direction of Julu Road. The closer you get there, the denser the crowds will be. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The location with the strongest Halloween atmosphere is Julu Road in Huangpu District, Shanghai. This is a commercial street named after the giant cruise ship &quot;Julu&quot; of the French Post Line. There are many exotic and Western-style shops. Historical buildings spread across this prosperous area. The most iconic one is the Sunken Plaza at No. 158 Julu Road, which has always been the most popular place to visit on Halloween. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the evening of October 31st, the night in Shanghai was getting darker and the carnival began. There is Tathagata Buddha riding a shared bicycle inadvertently passing by, exuding golden light; there is a zombie bride and the fire ghost king who are all dressed in red; there is also Lu Xun in a long robe, lamenting that studying medicine cannot save the Chinese people ; Pretending to be a potted plant, acting out a famous painting, or even raising a middle finger in a headband can create a bizarre landscape... The journey from Julu Road to Fuxing Park, less than 1 kilometer away, is packed with people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The level of crowding made police nervous. The entrance to Julu Road has been blocked by police with iron railings, and blue and red police lights are flashing everywhere. While maintaining order, the traffic police repeatedly emphasized: &quot;I am not a cosplayer.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Even the fence could not stop the enthusiastic flow of people. They took a shortcut from the nearby green slope about ten meters and sneaked into Julu road. Southern Weekend reporters followed the flow of people up the slope. Looking from above, Julu Road looked like a colorful light strip. The crowds of people almost filled the entire space on the road and flowed slowly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The adjacent Chengdu South Road disperses some of the flow of people overflowing from Julu Road. Relatively speaking, this place is a lot ordinary. There are two or three-story private houses on both sides of the road, full of clothing stores, leather bag stalls, taverns and fly restaurants. A restaurant owner sitting on the street is surrounded by a crowd of people. &quot;Normally there are not many people here.&quot; Here, from last Saturday until now, there are many people in the store.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If you take a few steps, you will see large and small black and white impermanences. They hold long red tongues. On their black and white high hats are written &quot;Peace in the world&quot; and &quot;Wealth at first sight&quot;. , including many children wearing thick black eye shadow and looking cute. At the corner, I met the White Snake and Fahai living in harmony. The masked men from the popular Korean drama &quot;Squid Game&quot; stood in a row against the wall and obediently cooperated with tourists to take photos. It had nothing to do with horror. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The most eye-catching people at the scene were the boys cosplaying Batman. They were tall and tall, with black masks covering their eyes, clear mandibles and indifferent expressions. From time to time, girls around him would scream, &quot;So handsome.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Batmans have been touring twice, always causing commotion at the scene. Their trump card is to take off their tight tops and expose their porcelain chest muscles if they disagree. Circle after circle of people gathered around to cheer. The tourists on the outside couldn&#39;t see it. They just stood on tiptoe and pointed their raised mobile phones towards the center to take pictures. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Within only three seconds, the Batmans were pushed out of the crowd by the police, and there was a burst of laughter from the crowd. This is a routine operation to maintain order on Halloween. People and &quot;ghosts&quot; causing congestion will be taken away by the police and moved to another place to ease the flow of people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;Batman Strong Man.

Photo by Li Zixuan&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A God of Wealth holding a gold ingot was undoubtedly respected. There was a long queue of tourists taking photos. Some people clasped their hands and bowed their heads in worship to the God of Wealth, begging her to bless them with good fortune. For about half an hour, the God of Wealth was blocked and did not move a step. The gold ingot was touched here and there. Every time he wanted to leave, he was pulled back by the person who took the photo. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The faces of the elderly also appeared in the crowd, and they were also very busy. Maybe it’s because “I can’t understand it, but I’m very shocked.” An elderly man sighed, “We also get to know the things of young people. It’s lively, fun, and fresh.”&lt;/p>; &lt; p>; &quot;Don&#39;t you think this is a release? A release of stress.&quot; Another Shanghai uncle talked to a Southern Weekend reporter. He had been standing on the roadside for two hours, observing and feeling the carnival atmosphere. My uncle is from Shanghai, but he has never seen such an atmosphere. &quot;I am very happy to see such an atmosphere. I think everyone is also happy from the bottom of their hearts. This is not a festival. Everyone is just using the festival as an excuse to be happy.&quot; , pure joy.” &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“Go crazy together and release stress”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;A novel scene appeared at the subway entrance near Julu Road. Many people gathered together to exchange professional opinions. So much so that the subway entrance was blocked again. Some said they were studying law, some were studying civil engineering, and some were studying architecture. Everyone complained that it was difficult to get along in the corresponding industry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What resonated strongly was the boy Xiao Xie who was surrounded. He looked haggard and had pale lips. The card hanging on his chest had four big words written on it: Studying Architecture. He was also carrying a bag with two wads of toilet paper. take-out box, looking impoverished. &quot;It is true that this industry is not very prosperous, and my work is not going well, so I take this opportunity to go crazy together.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Everyone is going crazy, and I want to go crazy too. It feels so good, and I put all my inner thoughts into it.&quot; Release the pressure.&quot; Xiao Xie just did a bold thing and resigned naked in October 2023. It was a period of work where &quot;I couldn&#39;t move even if I wanted to curl up, but I didn&#39;t dare to lie down&quot;. Everyone didn&#39;t dare to leave their seats after get off work, and they were chased by their leaders to make work demands. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The migrant worker who is even more out of the circle is Li Qiubai, the actor of Party B who wanders the same street. His makeup was rough and exaggerated. The dark eyeshadow and highlighter applied on his face made it look like his cheekbones were protruding and his cheeks were sunken. He had an A4 paper with &quot;Party B&quot; written on it in the collar of his checkered shirt, clearly showing a person who had been squeezed by Party A for a long time. haggard beat worker. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;Party B coser.

Photo provided by the interviewee&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“I cosplayed a character who had just finished his shift, and I didn’t expect the effect to be so good.” Li Qiubai had indeed just finished his shift, and it was already late at night when he arrived at Julu Road, so he decided to perform a Party B, who was tired, was constantly surrounded by people taking photos. The number of views on his social account has &quot;exploded&quot;, and many netizens have left messages expressing sympathy. &quot;Some people read the jokes, and some people look in the mirror. There are many comments like this.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Maybe it&#39;s because after the epidemic, there is no such activity that everyone can enjoy. Although the previous festivals were holidays, various tickets were not available.&quot; Li Qiubai said that now it has reached a In a festival where everyone can go crazy, I have an outlet to vent. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Here, Li Qiubai also encountered many poor people who did not need to dress up, as well as the resentful Party A. Some people held up signs: &quot;People who usually have a hard time pretending to be themselves don&#39;t need to dress up for Halloween.&quot; It&#39;s OK.&quot; Li Qiubai summed up this type of cosplay as: using realistic expression techniques to present the things that workers fear most. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the evening of October 31st, many cosplayers said they came over right after get off work. A King Zhou finished putting on a solemn dramatic face in his company, and walked around the streets to find two strangers, Daji, to form a CP; a 28-year-old young man drove here from Jiaxing City, Zhejiang Province, and she cosplayed Hayao Miyazaki&#39;s classic animated character, the Faceless Man, stood hunched silently on the roadside, with more than a hundred people gathered around to take a group photo. Because she had to go to work the next day, she returned to Jiaxing overnight. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Gongzi chose to release herself in another way. She played the role of SpongeBob SquarePants, who is also 37 years old. On weekdays, she is engaged in the company&#39;s business work, talking about cost-effectiveness and the company&#39;s maximum benefits. But before Halloween comes, the homemade yellow felt board square shell makes her purely the embodiment of happiness. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When Mr. Wang cosplayed Spongebob Squarepants into Happy Valley, he immediately became the center of attention and was even mistaken by tourists for being a professional staff member of the park. A crowd of chirping children followed her, stuffing her with candies and throwing out a hundred thousand whys: Did Mr. Krabs give you a day off? Why don&#39;t you bring Xiaowei to play with you? What’s the secret ingredient to the Krusty Krab? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;That night, Mr. Wang said, the whole group went crazy. Di Dixi, a colleague cosplaying as a Haidilao waiter, was originally a typical i person (referring to an introvert). In this atmosphere, she was directly reshaped into an e person (referring to an extrovert). She would take the initiative to get in front of some tourists. There is no real thing to do in the crazy performance, just twisting the hands in the air, but it is self-intoxicating. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;That night, Di Dixi also interviewed &quot;Li Jiaqi&quot; who sells eyebrow pencils for 79 yuan in cos. The other person replied in a long voice, &quot;Why is it so expensive? It&#39;s always the same price. It&#39;s really annoying.&quot; Dixi burst into laughter on the spot. Later, this video unexpectedly went viral. Prince Wang and his friends were all shocked. Is the Sheniu girl in front of them the same Didixi who dared not speak in front of others and pretended to be immersed in looking at her mobile phone? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;She became more aggressive after she woke up the next day. Looking back, she felt so embarrassed and a little bit ashamed.&quot; Didisi&#39;s friend recalled to a Southern Weekend reporter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Within a few days, Didixi led her two friends who were smarter than herself and headed towards Julu Road. She put on heavy makeup and went back. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;There are people on the street who cosplay and learn computers.

In 2022, he was dressed like An Lingrong and danced on roller skates, which made him a hot search. After all, &quot;The Legend of Zhen Huan&quot; is the &quot;electronic mustard&quot; for all. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this sea of ​​folk joy, Halloween has also become a traffic carnival, with many video teams wandering around. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“She is so hot.” ​​A Ying, who cosplayed An Lingrong’s Maid, was a little proud. She told Southern Weekend reporters that after deciding to perform the scene of “An Lingrong singing on the bow”, several commercials A team of people made careful planning and posted a &quot;thaw&quot; trailer on the short video platform, implying An Lingrong&#39;s return. They also made a video invitation with a route plan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“我们找的是货拉拉把道具船拖过去，刚从货拉拉下来，就有好多人喊安陵容。”10月28日晚，安陵容坐着船一出场，就被人流包围，直接分走了附近其他coser的流量。他们戴上廉价的假发，穿着与剧中一模一样的服装，船头的安陵容手持莲花，蓝牙音响里播放音乐《江南可采莲》，众人跟着合唱。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当时团队拍摄的短视频，点赞量飙升到数万。到了第二次在复兴公园出场时，现场直播有上千人观看。 “蛮好玩的，大家不约而同有非常多的创意，终于看到上海人民的松弛感了。”阿莹说。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;此前安陵容妆造的出圈，也启发到了杭州男孩醒醒。在这次万圣节中，他以cos向太的形象火出了圈。在其传播最广的一段视频中，醒醒穿着团队临时花了400元买来的粉红色大衣，一脸富贵相。有人问他怎么看待向太儿媳郭碧婷，他微微一笑：模仿道：“挺好操控的。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;对此，向太本人隔空回应：“衣服太low了，他应该模仿得更漂亮点。”这让醒醒团队受了惊，原本大家调侃，万圣节cos明星的阵仗，足以收到全网明星律师函，但火到这种程度，还是让人猝不及防。 “我们其实是有点害怕的，怕万一向佐团队找过来说我们有什么问题，但他们最后只说互动一下，那就去互动了。”醒醒团队工作人员阿眯对南方周末记者说。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;阿眯介绍，醒醒本职是一名自媒体美妆博主，向太妆造火后，有不少合作商家找上门，“非常多人私信我们谈合作，要醒醒去扮向太互动，我们拒绝了，挺怕被骂的。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;有人忐忑，有人欢喜。当看到向太和安陵容在网上爆火后，那英的扮演者这英也动了心。 “那我必须去呀。”11月1日，她在南方周末记者采访的电话那头模仿那英的口吻。此前，她买来《妻子的秘密》剧中黎明朗的衣服，最低配版的墨镜、发夹和话筒，连去巨鹿路三晚，模仿那英不断输出“那言那语”，“我一张嘴，他们就嗷嗷叫唤”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;效果立竿见影。这英版的那英，走到哪里都自带流量，即使是戴上口罩，摘掉眼镜，换上朋友的衣服，还是会被人认出来，狠狠体验了一把明星被追的待遇。 “他们以为我是真的那英，所有人尖叫，说太像了，喊&#39;那姐，别跑&#39;，&#39;那姐，给我拍照&#39;。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“我去之前我就知道会出圈，只是不确定会出圈到什么程度。”三天下来，这英的抖音粉丝涨了近十万，她紧紧抓住流量密码，“万圣节当晚回到家后，我还开了一场直播，希望可以趁着热度涨点粉”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在10月31日现场狂欢中，一声嘶吼突然让噪杂的人群顿了一下。 “还让不让人过了？”一个陷在人流里的外卖小哥发了火，他的车轮此刻寸步难行。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但很快气氛就恢复了，这样的场景并不陌生，时不时就有外卖员在沸腾的人群里嚷嚷：“让一让，超时了，超时了。”在这场分不清楚真真假假的狂欢活动中，很难不让人怀疑，他们是在cos外卖小哥。在采访期间，也有人向南方周末记者投来疑惑的眼神，问“你是在cos记者吗？”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;直到临近午夜时分，巨鹿路的人流逐渐淡了下来。跨过这个夜晚，上海又将回归大都市节奏紧张的一面。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;• &lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（文中受访者姓名均为化名）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;

&lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;田野在他的串串店图/网商银行公益小店联盟提供&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;海是蓝蓝的，一眼望不到边。向外是沙滩，长满了度假的人。再向外是主路，平坦宽阔，一台轮椅从远方驶来，正从沥青路向海边移动。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这里是海南三亚，松软细腻的沙粒尽显优质，然而却是对轮椅的挑战。轮椅的轮子容易下陷，田野坐在上面，得有人倒着向前拉，他才能缓缓移动，一点点，再一点点，沙滩和大海以更缓慢的速度，来到这个小伙身前。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;出门最艰难的处境在于，经常要等，“等一个帮助你的人出现”。田野几次跟我回忆旅途，比如从主路到沙滩，半米高的铁栏杆挡在眼前，别人能一下跨过去，他却不能。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;溜冰、散打、开车，17岁之前的西安小伙田野好动，眼中的未来“无所不能”。 2004年，一场意外车祸导致他高位截瘫，此后只能坐在轮椅上。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在被动等待之外，他和其他坐在轮椅上的“伤友”们互相鼓励着，走出门去，绘制出西安主城区三环内各处无障碍设施的地图，标记出存在的问题，打通出门的路。 3个月、4辆轮椅，每天15小时，成就一张597平方公里的无障碍地图，三种颜色分类做出了上千个标记，布满西安三环内所有主干道，相关部门据此清理障碍，更多出门的路出现在身障人士眼中。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一路走来，他们遭受过不少非议，“绕一下不就得了吗，为什么非走这条路？”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“没有想抄近路，我只是想走本来的那条路。”田野坐在轮椅上，重复这个回答。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/H8IgQNi0WPgEHVQguJObawbf6qFhz4KA5xiCCPJJ.jpg&quot;

&lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;“伤友”们一起推着轮椅行走在无障碍通道图/微电影《嘿，出来》 &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;被精确的身体需求&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;一辆轮椅遇见另一辆轮椅，越来越多，五六个开轮椅的人聚在空旷的场地上，“嘿，出来！”简单的招呼过后，他们开始了比赛——轮椅竞速。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;赛道很长，需要穿过一些无障碍通道，道路细微的不规范可能导致轮椅的减速甚至暂停，这是坐在轮椅上的他们驶过无数次的路，曾经的不规范被一一标注、反馈、打通。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;竞速结束，他们会相约去吃上一顿，聚餐地点在田野的串串店。在那里，身障人士就餐打五折，是“伤友”们的固定聚餐点。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但一连数日，我始终没等到这样的画面。 9月中旬，正逢西安雨季，持续十几天的阴雨，分隔开此前的夏与之后的冬。 “西安没秋，”当地人这么说。一转眼，天气由热转冷，不给人准备的时间。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;即便在西安生活了数十年，即便是天气的细微变化，“伤友”们也感觉不适，雨来了，他们更加出不去了。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;凑在一起，不容易。他们正在慢慢习惯，就像生活中很多的细节，都需要重新适应，在时间中寻找新的秩序。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;他们需要精确控制自己的身体需求。比如最简单的喝水，要定时、定量，做好精确管理，否则无法控制大小便的时间规律，给出门增加困难；不喝水是不行的，有人试过，膀胱系统感染、尿路感染的问题会随之而来。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/UlsQrXIjBHgH2o9TqtQrZZpjwhsb6zBL2GZwJCRj.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/UlsQrXIjBHgH2o9TqtQrZZpjwhsb6zBL2GZwJCRj.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256500&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;微电影拍摄杀青后，田野和剧组人员合照&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（网商银行公益小店联盟提供/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;喝水的速度也要控制，喝得太快、太猛，水过快从喉咙到了膀胱，误差随之出现，五分钟的时间差，对于出门的轮椅来说，就可能意味着超过两小时的意外。这两小时的行程是紧凑的：找到合适的地点、清理自己的身体，再推开门走上街，假装一切不曾发生。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;与身体培养默契，需要应对季节的变化。比如夏天和冬天，人的出汗量不同，对应的喝水规律自然不同。探索每一细小规律的方寸之差，源自“伤友们”心底深处难以抗拒出门的诱惑。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;田野开的打五折的串串店也是“伤友”们出门的诱惑之一。 17岁那年他遭遇意外车祸，高位截瘫，依靠轮椅出行，成为“伤友”圈的一员。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;第一次见到田野，是在他的家中。尿路感染是伤友们的常见病之一，田野刚从医院输液回来，坐在轮椅上，身体歪向一侧，讲话的尾音垂在地上，带着强撑精神的疲惫。脚上是运动鞋，不时需要人帮他搬动一下，确保踩在轮椅的踏板上，聊天时间一长，就需要移动一下。重力的作用会让他的脚越来越不舒服，直到向身边的人开口求助。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;大多数时候，这个人是他的爸爸。 “爸，喝水。”“爸，可乐。”不需要道谢，不需要解释，或者其他任何理由，漫长的时间会把这样的对话简化为最直接的表达。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;田野住在西安市曲江新区，这里平均每隔几百米建有一个公共卫生间，配备有无障碍卫生间。田野坐在电动轮椅上，熟练地开往家附近的一个公共卫生间。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;打开无障碍卫生间的门，里面设施完备，有能把婴童放在横板上躺着换尿布的设施，有能把婴童固定坐在一侧方便家长如厕的设施，也有带着扶手方便残障人士如厕的设施。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;而完备的另一面，只有真正使用的人才能感受到其中细微的差异。田野推着轮椅，走到镜子前，在平整洁净的半身镜中，他看不到自己。田野解释，镜子需要有一定的倾斜度，才能在低处看到自己的面貌。我试着弯腰低头，让自己的视线与坐在轮椅上的他的头部高度持平，不再敢说这是“细微”之差。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;从主路通往卫生间的无障碍通道的两边并不平整，而站在一旁却看不出异常。 “两边不平，”田野的爸爸用手比量了一下。相关道路规范是误差不能超过2厘米，“1厘米以内（误差）对于轮椅上下来说不影响，但这条路至少有5厘米的误差。”直到田野的轮椅缓缓上行，几次用力都推不上去，猛然加速可能侧翻，我才意识到视线内的毫厘之差对于轮椅意味着什么。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;田野接着解释刚刚走过的盲道分类：盲道砖是分两类，条形状的是引导砖，引导盲人安全放心前行的，这种称为行进盲道砖；另外一种就是圆点状的提示砖，用于提示盲人前面有障碍，应该进行转弯了，这种称为提示盲道砖。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“我以前什么都不懂，”田野笑了笑，开始回忆“懂”的节点，那是一场意外车祸。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/wQfffxl6KOaODmI8pg8ZKFKJx3CfUGGQw8fThb3J.jpg&quot;

&lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;田野的串串店成了“伤友”的相聚之地&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（网商银行公益小店联盟提供/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;给所有人看的戏&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;灰白色的桑塔纳穿过，车牌号留在田野心底，直到多年后他依然能脱口而出。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;车子尚未驶过之前，田野的人生是“动”的。他出生于1987年，祖祖辈辈在西安大雁塔附近生活。田野从小调皮好动，喜欢看武侠片。李连杰主演的《黄飞鸿》里“狮王争霸”的名场面给他留下深刻印象。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;后来，他去了武校，从13岁到15岁，整整两年，练习武术。年少时喜欢滑旱冰，他总是滑得最好最快的那一个。当时流行一种叫“开火车”的游戏，一群人前后拽着向前滑，时而直，时而斜，变换着队形，开在第一个的人被称作“火车头”，“火车快不快，全靠头来带”，田野总是扮演火车头的角色。有武校的底子在身，他的速度与平衡感、力量感都很出挑，“像秋天的叶子在空中飘落”，侧空翻、劈叉不在话下，拉火车能拉一百多人。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;再后来，不念书、不学武了，田野开过推土机，修过车。在工地，除了塔吊，别的能见到的“车”，他都开过。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这样的速度停在17岁那年。 2004年，田野遭遇车祸。捡回一条命后，他住了21天ICU（重症监护治疗病房），不知道花了多少钱，接着又在床上躺了8个月，瘦成皮包骨，那是人生中最痛苦的一段时间。田野回忆，当时他1米7多的身高，体重只有七八十斤，身上肋骨根根分明，看得真切。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;后来的10年里，父母带着他四处求医问药，去过专科医院，也找过江湖郎中。偏方、秘方不知试了多少，钱花了，苦吃了，人却没能站起来。 “凯子（&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;当地方言，意为&#39;傻子&#39;&lt;/span>;）上当，当当不一样，”田野感慨当时一家人的状态，不愿意接受事实，总觉得还能站起来，应该能站起来。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;现实中寻不到出口，田野把一个梦记在心里。梦里他进了一座庙，很多和尚正在打坐敲木鱼，他跪在佛像面前。大雄宝殿突然门开了，伴随一道金光，一个老和尚进来，他对着田野说，“你本应该下地狱。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;田野不解，哭着问，“我这么善良，没做过什么天大的坏事，为什么我要下地狱，为什么我要坐轮椅？”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;和尚回，“坐轮椅已经很不错了，你本来要下地狱的。”和尚在空中画了一个圈，像是个电视，田野在里面看到自己是一个王子，在战乱厮杀中跑进一座寺庙，拿木棍把一尊菩萨像的头打了下来。看完后，田野在梦里嚎啕大哭，醒来继续哭。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;哭过之后，尽管梦境虚幻，田野却好像从现实之外找到了某种安慰的理由。他不再困惑，不再觉得被命运针对。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;聊到转变的节点，田野沉吟了一会，说到“使命”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“你的使命是什么？”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“我在演一场戏，观众是所有人。过去我是个特别调皮的孩子，意外出了车祸，周围的一些人说那就是报应，或者说是因果，因为我以前太调皮了，别人会用我来教育自家孩子。一开始我觉得反感，后来我是开心的，我的遭遇成了家长教育孩子的反面教材——&#39;不要学田野&#39;。就从这里，我慢慢找到了自己人生的方向，便不再寂寞。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;田野决定开一家串串店。最早开在小区里，2013年5月，从8个蜂窝煤炉、一把伞、几条板凳，到六七十个炉子、搭了棚子，再到活动板房，“变得有模有样”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/HhSWrv4fr2rlVImIZRyMe3AFC0sx4JLiDOIl0a8O.jpg&quot;

&lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;2021年夏，田野和“伤友”们在西安曲江南湖体验无障碍设施&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（受访者提供/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2021年6月，小店搬到离家1公里左右的铺面，“那是生意最好的时候”。 120平方米的店面，每天能开百来桌，人多到坐不下。半年后，店面再次扩大，田野换租到隔壁300平米的店铺。刚搬完的当月中旬，西安出现新冠肺炎病例，2021年11月，田野的串串店刚开张就迎来闭店。 2022年整一年，小店关门180天，亏损几十万。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;到了2023年，田野以为疫情没了、政策放开了，一切会变好，但生意却变淡了。我们见面的9月中旬，店面正在装修，田野想用新的面貌来迎回曾经的红火。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“新店要不要装无障碍卫生间？”在田野的另一家米线店，我看着他问。这家米线店可能开不下去了，田野想缓解一点财务压力，以后有余力再做。米线店的房租支出一年在9万元左右，生意并不好，他分析是因为地段不好。我们在店门口聊天的时候，小雨时不时落下，这家店夹在写字楼的背面，附近还有几家快餐店，生意都不算好，雨天的街上行人稀少。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;他说，考虑过装无障碍卫生间，但还是不现实。好在方便的是，串串店附近一百米左右就有公共卫生间，那里有无障碍设施，方便“伤友”解决如厕问题。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;开店以来，身障人士来田野的串串店消费，一律打八五折。 2021年5月，网商银行公益小店联盟成立，田野的串串店加入，在网商银行的支持下，推出残障人士半价吃串的套餐活动。王烨是这个公益小店项目的发起人，她介绍平台的主要用户是小店主。在做这个公益项目的时候，她想知道“店主们”都是什么人。当时正处在疫情期间，王烨最先接触到一家西安饺子馆的店主，一些人来西安找工作没找到、钱花完了，老板在门口贴了张纸，大意是“有困难没什么大不了，进来吃碗饺子，不要钱”。公益小店项目给了饺子店主1万元扶持金。 “怎么会有这么真诚的人，他明明就很难。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;后来王烨发现了田野的串串店，同样给了1万元扶持金，“伤友五折吃串”的活动上线。王烨的工作任务是在全国找到1000家这样的店，“1000是我们的上限。我们不找一开始就下决心做公益的，那样很难坚持下去的，我们就找那种本来就在正常经营的。”接触过很多家这样的公益小店后，王烨感慨公益不是靠感性的冲动，需要有目标感，需要有价值观在心里，不能是一时的热血，一定是一直的信念，“我知道我在干嘛。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/HRxm6HYZRBJQrPvguHMPfH6yDPutZ5LttZbHWl4j.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/HRxm6HYZRBJQrPvguHMPfH6yDPutZ5LttZbHWl4j.jpg&quot;

&lt;h4>;交给时间去呈现&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;除串串店外，田野和伤友们的公益“版图”还在于绘制一张无障碍地图。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2018年8月，田野与结识的6名残障人士自筹资金共同成立“SCI无翼飞翔”公益中心。 “没有翅膀，也想飞行”是他们成立“无翼飞翔”的初衷。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“无翼飞翔”成立后，田野与伤友们用3个月的时间开展西安市三环内的道路无障碍环境调查，想法最初是“伤友”黄远提出来的。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;黄远，今年52岁，2011年7月遭遇车祸，胸部第9根到第12根肋骨受伤，此后需要借助轮椅出行。在轮椅上，他跑过半程马拉松。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;谈到和“伤友”一起出门，他觉得更加没有压力。最困难的可能是临时上厕所的问题，比如大小便没控制好，尤其是大便，要回到家中或者在无障碍厕所一点点清理自己，动辄一两个小时。 “伤友”之间一个眼神、一句话就完全懂，不需要解释，也能给予全部的理解，因为他们有“平等的身体”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;身体最严重的问题在于没有知觉，他的大腿在一次出门后肿成了原先的3倍，直到那时才发现受伤。右腿伤疤，是2022年5月份留下的，至今还没好。他挽起裤管，凹凸不平的小腿上有深深浅浅的疤痕。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;讲到出门，黄远总是笑意满满。 “伤友们”开着轮椅在路上观察，发现哪里的无障碍设施有问题就拍照传给黄远，汇集了上万张照片。黄远最终选择可用的5000张照片，制作成电子地图。这需要大量的幕后工作，比如GPS反向读出坐标，然后把照片对应到相应位置，用不同颜色的记号标注。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这份电子地图有不同图层加以区别：一是按照行政区域划分，二是按照原因分类，包括设计不规范、建设不到位和后期破坏与损耗三类。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;以黄远的经验来看，设计方案大部分是到位的，因为有标准图，但在施工建设和监督验收的环节，有时会出问题，出现“样子货”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;经过3个月的调研，黄远编写了《西安市无障碍设施状况调查报告》，制作出一份特殊的西安无障碍问题分布的电子地图，清晰标注了每一个存在无障碍问题的地点、图片展示、原因类别等。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;调查结果以电子邮件方式递送到相关路政部门，其中一些问题得到了整改。这份地图和报告依然在黄远的电脑中保留着，尽管“公益中心”目前已经因为资金不足无力维系。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;完整的调查并不是一开始就有的，最初是零星的“爱心贴”。刘思芳顺手从茶几下拿出一沓，粉红色的便利贴上印有“我是残障人士，您的车辆挡住了无障碍通道”的话语，他的轮椅背包里也有一摞，出门随身带。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;刘思芳今年60岁，50岁那年血管发病，颈动脉漏了，医生告诉他，患这种罕见病的人，世界范围内的记录不超过50例。 2014年，他在西安医学院做了手术，此后的生活离不开拐杖和轮椅。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;刘思芳家里养了几只鹦鹉，在房间里飞来飞去，一会儿落在肩上、一会儿落在头上，平添几分生气。他给这些鸟都起了名字，在家也算多个了乐趣。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;谈到制作爱心贴和做无障碍通道地图，刘思芳提到，“是给出门找一个理由。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;原先是零零星星的爱心贴，后来伤友们想，“算了，自己跑吧，做个整体的。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“验收的人也不是残疾人，”谈到使用无障碍设施遇到的问题，刘思芳更多选择了理解：会碰到不合规的“斜坡问题”，还有一些把无障碍通道做成石子路的，也许是为了美观，但小轮轮椅走不成，得是大轮轮椅，限制了一部分轮椅的出行……这样的细节只有坐在轮椅上才能有真正的认知。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;加速度会上瘾，为了让更多“伤友”出门，也为了鼓舞自我，3个月、4辆轮椅、每天15小时，小店“伤友”们在西安走出了一张597平方公里的无障碍地图，3种颜色、上千个标记，布满西安三环内所有主干道。 “伤友”们被称为“轮椅竞速小王子”，他们经常约在西安城郊，坐在轮椅上开展竞速赛。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;出门是困境，也是诱惑。田野去过最远的地方是三亚，那是在五六年前。面对大海，头上是阳光，脚下是沙滩，喝着冰镇西瓜汁，戴着墨镜，他仿佛置身于一个新世界。那是春节时分，远在千里之外的家乡西安正是隆冬，风照刮、雪照下。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;他并不擅长表达，海浪的声音怎么形容呢？谈到那种遥远，田野的目光拉长，变得越来越远，穿过面前的墙壁，淡淡的笑容浮现在脸上，他好像又听见了，那“像西安的春天”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“等一个帮助你的人出现”是出门可能需要的好运气。就在我们访谈的前几天，西安下了一场大雨。店里有事必须去对接一下，田野开着电动轮椅出门，一不小心栽倒在路边水坑，因为雨太大把坑盖住了没留意到。妈妈看他半天没过去，沿路回来找，才发现儿子人跪在地上，半个身子泡在水里。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;雨天行人不多，有位女士想帮忙扶，但力气不够，后来又来了一位男士，几人合力才把田野救出。等待足足花了半小时，“也有经过但没帮忙的人”，田野在最后淡淡补了一句。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;出门会听到反对的声音，“残疾人啥都干不了，就在家里别出来了。出门干嘛，尽给社会添乱。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;田野对这样的话感到愤怒，“一个正常的社会应该是一个包容的社会，不但包容人，连马路上的小动物、花花草草也应该包容。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;接触中，王烨感受到田野的乐观是带有悲凉底色的，“他不是没心没肺的、没有痛苦的，他会有很多沉思的时候，他遇到的困难都是经营上的，身体上的他已经习惯了。”在王烨眼中，田野是用心经营的一个店主，“我更愿意介绍他是一个用心努力的人，是一个店主，而不是先用残障人士去介绍他。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;10年前，有了想写一本书的念头，田野坐在轮椅上，断断续续述说过往，他想写自己这一生。窗户在他背面，屋外是淅淅沥沥的雨声，屋内有些凉意。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“我没有想过开头和结尾，”田野回答我对于“一辈子”这本书的疑问，“也许人生毫无意义，但并不代表应该随便度过。我知道自己的剧本是什么样子，但还是会把它演完。”这本书，他想一步一步讲，用时间去呈现。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 04 Nov 2023 09:25:03 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
