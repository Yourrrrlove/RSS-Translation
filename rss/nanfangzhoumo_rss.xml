Pictures and texts are irrelevant. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;You are no longer from our hospital.&quot; One sentence announced that Chen Min has been a non-staff nurse for ten years The end of a career. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In front of two doctors, three bedded patients and their families in the ward, the dismissal notice came suddenly. Staying for a second longer makes you feel embarrassed. In September 2023, Chen Min recalled to Southern Weekend that after hearing the order to leave, she did not hesitate, returned to the office, took off her nurse uniform, took away the cup and notebook, and kept a group photo with the department. In the cupboard. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Eight months ago, Chen Ming just turned 35 and became the first batch of labor dispatch workers dismissed from a second-class hospital in Hunan where she worked. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past ten years, she has shuttled between wards and departments, looking no different from other nurses. But somewhere invisible, there is always a thread named &quot;weaving&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Using this line as the boundary, people like Chen Min who work in state agencies or institutions in the form of labor dispatch but are not within the establishment are called &quot;non-staff personnel.&quot; In addition, common non-staff personnel include “contract workers” hired by government agencies, hospitals, schools and other units who sign contracts with workers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In recent years, information about “retiring non-staff personnel” that has appeared from time to time has attracted attention to this group. In 2022, Fangxian County, Hubei Province promoted the standardization of the clean-up of non-staff employed personnel, and stated that &quot;the clean-up of non-staff personnel involves a wide range of areas and a large number&quot;, and the clean-up process needs to &quot;effectively safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of government agencies, institutions and non-staff personnel.&quot; In February 2023, a symposium on the clean-up and standardization of non-staff personnel held in Tongcheng City, Anhui Province mentioned that clean-up and retirement is not the ultimate goal, but to standardize and rectify the chaos of non-staff employment and improve government administrative efficiency and service levels. Provide employment assistance for retired personnel, and actively and steadily promote special actions to clean up and standardize non-staff personnel.&quot; In August, the Lichuan City Institutional Establishment Committee Office in Hubei Province stated that the city had eliminated 301 irregular non-staff employees. In Jianli, Hubei, Linxiang, Hunan, Harbin, Heilongjiang and other places, public information shows that the removal of non-staff personnel is also in progress. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this wave, some non-staff personnel are deeply frustrated, and some take the opportunity to step out of their comfort zones and look for a decent job again. News from Daoxian County, Yongzhou City, Hunan Province stated that as of September 20, 1,038 laid-off non-staff personnel had been re-employed in the county. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Premonition of unemployment&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The non-staff personnel interviewed had a premonition of being laid off. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As early as 2022, Chen Min heard from colleagues about the news of eliminating non-staff personnel. At first, he didn’t believe it. Later, he searched online and found that other cities had taken action. But the news only circulated secretly in the hospital, and she never saw the red-headed document. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On December 31, 2022, the contract signed by Chen Min with a third-party labor dispatch company expired. The hospital leader told her that &quot;the epidemic has just ended and there is no time to sign the contract, so she must go to work first.&quot; Just two or three days later, she was fired on the grounds that &quot;the state had issued a policy.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In March 2023, similar &quot;gossip&quot; spread in a hospital in Dengta City, Liaoning Province. Li Zhen, 28, has worked in the vaccination department of the hospital for nearly seven years. In this hospital with less than 400 employees, it only takes a few turns for the news to reach her ears. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, Li Zhen felt the signal even stronger. Salaries that cannot be paid on time, successive layoffs in other departments, rumors that leaders in charge of each department are fighting to keep their subordinates, the newly appointed dean twice went to the vaccination department and mentioned &quot;there are too many people&quot;... these have given rise to unemployment. The real feeling of pressing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The more precise news came on the night of May 16, the day before she was dismissed. She heard from a relative who had an acquaintance working in the hospital that the layoffs might &quot;be your turn.&quot; A few.&quot; The next day, the leader in charge of the department called: &quot;There is bad news. You can&#39;t keep it this time.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Zhen said that in the memories of the old nurses at the hospital, there were more than 30 people working in the hospital. This is the first time that no one has been laid off in recent years. The hospital told her, &quot;The hospital now owes money and cannot support so many people. You should understand the hospital.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hu Xiaodong, a professor at the School of Politics and Public Administration at China University of Political Science and Law, analyzed to Southern Weekend the existence of non-staff personnel. There are historical reasons for this and development, which were influenced by the thinking of “more people make things easier” and the increase in workload at that time. When public institutions like hospitals are saturated with workload and existing staff cannot complete the work, they recruit non-staff personnel to assist in the work. And the hospital&#39;s &quot;most of the funds for supporting non-staff personnel come from their own income.&quot; The main reason for dismissing non-staff personnel now may be related to its own profits and policies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, Hu Xiaodong mentioned that the &quot;Party and State Institutional Reform Plan&quot; released in March 2023 mentioned streamlining the establishment, but it was limited to central and state agencies and local party and government agencies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Non-staff personnel in some government agencies have been affected before. 29-year-old Lin Jiangtao has been working in a government unit in Yuxi, Yunnan for four years. At the end of December 2022, while he was on paternity leave, he received a notice of competitive employment from the unit. Due to economic layoffs, 36 people outside the establishment were required to undergo written examinations and interviews. Decided to stay or go. &quot;I probably understood it when I heard this. I guess I will be laid off this time.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Uneasiness surged in Lin Jiangtao&#39;s heart. He recalled that at that time, he frequently looked at job information on local talent recruitment websites, viewed short videos on social media that taught people how to deal with middle-aged unemployment, and even asked a master to tell fortunes. Lin Jiangtao sent his birth date and work address, and the master told him that he &quot;may not be unemployed.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For insurance, Lin Jiangtao hired a teacher to conduct structured interviews, which cost 1,500 yuan for two days. On December 29, 2022, the day before his birthday, he still received a text message that he was dismissed. He was competing for the last place in the induction examination. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The removal of non-staff personnel is related to the reduction of staff. Hu Xiaodong explained that the key to the increase or decrease of establishment is whether the use of establishment can improve work efficiency. Nowadays, non-staff personnel in government departments at all levels bear the actual work of many internal staff. “It is necessary to return the civil servant work performed or replaced by existing non-staff personnel to the civil servants themselves and return the responsibilities of civil servants.” &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Before the crisis&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;After graduating from technical secondary school, Li Zhen once thought about working in Shenyang, which is 40 to 50 minutes&#39; drive away from home. As the only child in the family, her father was reluctant to let her go away, so he asked someone to find connections to get her to come to this hospital. Although the average salary was only more than 2,000 yuan a month, &quot;as long as she has a place to occupy herself.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are eight people in the vaccination department, all of whom are &quot;contract workers.&quot; Li Zhen is mainly responsible for vaccine information registration in the department. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Almost all children in the county are vaccinated at their hospital. During busy times, it takes three hours in the morning to register the information of about a hundred children. Over time, Li Zhen developed the habit of speaking and typing quickly. When I met the children and parents who came for vaccination, I blurted out three key questions in Northeastern dialect: &quot;Is the child sick, has he taken medicine, and is he healthy?&quot; In the time it takes a new colleague to enter the information of one child, Li Zhen can enter the information of three. As soon as he sees the child&#39;s age in months, he knows which injection should be given to the child. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When you have free time, you can get off work early after finishing your busy morning. &quot;The job is easy, the salary is fixed&quot;, and there is also medical insurance and pension insurance paid by the hospital - this is already a good job in a small county. Li Zhen has no mortgage, car loan or children, and her husband&#39;s monthly salary is five to six thousand yuan. They live a stress-free life in a small county with low prices. With the idea of ​​&quot;leaving this place for retirement&quot;, Li Zhen never thought of leaving. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before the unemployment crisis, many people believed that non-staff work could be done &quot;until retirement&quot; because it was &quot;close to the establishment.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The same goes for Lin Jiangtao. In his view, his job is no different from that of a clerk, &quot;delivering information, setting up accounts, and at most compiling information at the end of the year.&quot; Because of the nature of the company, I need to go to the company for safety inspections, and I don’t have to strictly stay on duty. There are also five insurances paid by the company. “I can’t find a more satisfying (job) than this.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When &quot;Lingping&quot; was in the unit, two or three non-staff colleagues left because they were admitted to civil servants or public institutions. Lin Jiangtao felt envious, but did not act. It wasn&#39;t until he lost his job that he realized how &quot;fragrant&quot; the establishment was. If the time could go back ten years, he would like to advise his 19-year-old self to make a good life plan and consider taking a job. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the cruel reality is that even if Lin Jiangtao goes back to ten years ago and tries his best to take the exam, the result may not be satisfactory. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Chen Min spent ten years preparing for the exam. From the time she got a part-time job, her life was spent working and preparing for exams. After get off work every night, her schedule is to go back to her room to read and prepare for exams. She is unable to respond to her colleagues&#39; calls to eat and play cards, and she cannot &quot;waste&quot; more time cooking or spending time with her family. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Unlike the comfort Lin Jiangtao felt at work, Chen Min&#39;s work in the hospital was unstable. In the past ten years, she has been rotated through at least eight departments. The shortest one she stayed in was only half a year, and the doctors in the department were not fully recognized. The longest one was less than three years. When I go to some new departments, I even have to start from scratch. However, the transfer of colleagues within the staff will not be so frequent. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In her perception, hospital employees are divided into four levels based on employment forms. The highest level is within the establishment, followed by personnel agency, labor contract, and labor dispatch. Dispatched workers also have five insurances and one housing fund, but their wages are the lowest. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The difference buried in daily work always reminds me that I am a &quot;non-staff person&quot;, and the age limit of &quot;under 35 years old&quot; for the staff examination is tightly pressed, which further intensifies Chen Min&#39;s pursuit of staff. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Whenever there is a recruitment announcement in her hospital, Chen Min will sign up. On several occasions, she passed the written exam but was dropped again after the interview. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/04/HUsJgmRsZHd34X3wdBGavXwIPRGxouwipDVaif7w.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;768&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/04/HUsJgmRsZHd34X3wdBGavXwIPRGxouwipDVaif7w.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253010&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Many places require that the removal of non-staff personnel be actively and steadily promoted. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Survival and Emotion&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;After being fired, for more than a month, Chen Min is immersed in anxiety and relies on medication to maintain sleep every day. At a rehabilitation hospital near her home, Chen Min was diagnosed with moderate depression. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The treating doctor advised Chen Min to learn to look away and not push herself too hard. Her parents-in-law also told her that it didn’t matter if she didn’t go to work. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For those who have accumulated some &quot;capital&quot; after working for many years, after losing their jobs, survival is not the first concern that arises, but emotions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Over the past few years, Chen Min considers himself devoted to his work. Her home is close to the hospital, only ten minutes&#39; walk. When she was not working the night shift, she also told the doctors and nurses after work, &quot;If you are too busy at night, just call me and I will come right away.&quot; Her WeChat ID is still left in the previous department for patients Appointments, consultations, return visits. Chen Min described her work as her lover, and the sudden unemployment felt like being separated from her lover. &quot;It will probably be difficult to get out of it within a year or two.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For retired non-staff personnel, a buffer period may be needed. Hu Xiaodong mentioned that for the sake of humanistic care, the unit should set up a buffer period to &quot;give them a buffer space from psychology to behavior. The unit can also help non-staff personnel who are about to be laid off find new jobs in accordance with laws and regulations.&quot; In addition, he also suggested designing a return-to-work appointment system. When these non-staff personnel are needed again in the future, units can give priority to hiring personnel with return-to-work certificates. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to divert his attention and renew his suspended social security payment, Chen Min began to look for a new job. Health care centers, specialized hospitals, private clinics, confinement centers, and places related to nursing are the first to be considered. More than ten years ago, she applied for the nursing major because &quot;it was easy to find a job.&quot; Now the number of nurses has exceeded 5 million, and employers have more and younger choices. Chen Min said that because she was over 35 years old, she was either unable to register for the exam or was not accepted. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lin Jiangtao also encountered a similar situation. He saw a job opening at a vocational training company on the local talent recruitment website. On the day of the interview, his boss, who was in his forties, introduced to him what he had achieved in his twenties and asked him: &quot;Why are you still looking for a job at the age of 29?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lin Jiangtao restrained his emotions. , replied calmly: &quot;Why can&#39;t you find a job at the age of 29? People who are 59, 69 or even 79 may be looking for a job.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When he first lost his job, Lin Jiangtao also had self-doubt. But soon, he told himself that when he was at a low point in his life, he must not push himself too hard or go against himself; when he encountered a suitable opportunity, he would take the initiative to fight for it, but there was no need to be too anxious. &quot;Looking for a job is like looking for a partner, take your time.&quot; . &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Step out of the comfort zone&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;From May to August, Li Zhen rested at home for three months. Not long ago, he went to Nantong, Jiangsu, intending to try home textile live broadcast. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are requirements for live broadcasts. You must dress fashionably and wear heavy makeup. You can&#39;t just wear sportswear and white shoes on the inside, a nurse&#39;s uniform on the outside, and light makeup like you do in the hospital. Even when he speaks, he pays attention to standard Mandarin. &quot;After speaking Northeastern dialect for so many years, it suddenly feels so awkward.&quot; Li Zhen stood next to the anchor, feeling a sense of discomfort that made her shrink back. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After staying in Jiangsu for half a month, Li Zhen returned to his hometown and spent 7 days learning to make milk tea locally. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In September, she and her friends opened a milk tea shop near the school. Although it was more tiring, she could adapt. The work is busier than before, but she thinks that the more work she does, the more she will get. &quot;Maybe by selling this extra hour, I can make more money. I think it is for myself.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some people have taken bigger steps, such as Chen Min, who moved from the hospital to small restaurants and barbecue stalls. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After looking for a job for more than a month and asking for more than 20 nursing-related positions, Chen Min still found nothing. After consulting teachers from her previous school, she turned to preparing for the Licensed Pharmacist Qualification Certificate. If she passed the exam, she could work in a chain pharmacy. &quot;It&#39;s relatively stable and there&#39;s no age limit.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But before that, I have to find a job to transition. Chen Min walked along the street from shop to shop until he saw a notice recruiting waiters at a small restaurant on the street, and worked as a waiter there. After being introduced by the restaurant owner&#39;s wife, I came to work part-time as a dishwasher at a nearby barbecue stall. The total of the two salaries is not much different from that of working in the hospital. Chen Min also paid social security again in the form of flexible employment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, Chen Min still has her own concerns about these two jobs. When looking for a job, she deliberately avoided being near the hospital because she didn&#39;t want to run into her former colleagues. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When working in the hospital, the nurses wear the same uniforms and masks, with their eyes exposed. Most of the time, patients have difficulty even distinguishing nurses with different appearances, and they treat nurses with the same courtesy and respect. But after taking off her nurse&#39;s uniform and mask, she was still a little worried when facing the guests, food and dishes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Now her time is divided into four periods. She gets up at 7 a.m. to prepare for the exam, works as a waiter in a restaurant from 10:30 a.m. to 7 p.m., then washes dishes at a barbecue stall, and returns around 12 p.m. home, and then continue reading until 2 o&#39;clock in the morning. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Her parents-in-law still take care of everything at home for her, and her husband also supports her to continue taking exams and do what she wants to do. Occasionally, my 7-year-old son saw Chen Min reading in her room and brought her own books to keep her company. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On social media, Chen Min wrote: &quot;My failure to pass the establishment examination is definitely not because I didn&#39;t work hard enough, but I still believe that hard work will reward me in another way in the future.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt; p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(Chen Min, Li Zhen, and Lin Jiangtao are pseudonyms)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 05 Oct 2023 10:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[调停俄乌冲突，百岁基辛格的功绩与争议丨智库视点]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258084]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-05 09:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;On September 24, 2023 local time, according to the &quot;Ukrainian Pravda&quot; report, Ukrainian President Zelensky During his recent visit to the United States, he met with former US Secretary of State Kissinger. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Andrei Yermak, director of the Ukrainian Presidential Office, posted the above news on social media. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Kissinger visited China two months ago and attended the Bund Financial Summit online on September 23. The centenarian is still playing his part on the international stage. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Why Kissinger is still active&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The world today is facing huge risks, unlike any risks since the Cold War. Previous risks, whether the United States sent troops to Afghanistan or Iraq, occurred between world powers and small and medium-sized countries, and the risk of escalation is unlikely. But this time, it has become a confrontation between world powers and a strategic confrontation between nuclear powers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the one hand, the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the Great Game between Russia and the West behind it have had a strong impact on the post-Cold War world order. The conflict between Russia and Ukraine marks a serious challenge to the post-Cold War world order. On the other hand, this is also the first indirect confrontation between Russia and the US and Western camps after the Cold War. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to Yermak&#39;s account, Kissinger told Zelensky during the meeting, &quot;Before this war, I opposed Ukraine joining NATO because I was worried that it would set in motion the war we are seeing now. process (the outbreak of the conflict). Now this process has reached such an extent that the idea of ​​​​keeping Ukraine neutral in this situation no longer makes sense.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is not the first time Kissinger has mentioned Ukraine joining NATO. On May 17, The Economist published an exclusive interview with Kissinger. During the interview, Kissinger stated that he supports Ukraine&#39;s membership of NATO. He also said: &quot;Ukraine should continue to be protected by Europe, rather than becoming an isolated country that protects itself on its own.&quot; Regarding Russia, Kissinger said, &quot;If I talk to (Russian President) Putin, I will tell him , Ukraine will be safer if it stays in NATO.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Regarding the Russia-Ukraine conflict, Kissinger called on all parties to sit down and carry out diplomatic negotiations. He warned that there is now a risk that the great powers&#39; military relationships dominate their geopolitical calculations. The Russia-Ukraine conflict may therefore develop into a global conflict, and diplomatic negotiations will become &quot;increasingly important.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the other hand, Sino-US relations have undergone qualitative changes since the Trump era. Conflict has begun to replace cooperation and become the key word in Sino-US relations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Therefore, the relationship between the world&#39;s major powers, represented by the relationship between China, the United States and Russia, has become very dangerous. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this context, Kissinger became increasingly worried about Sino-US relations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to a report by Xinhua News Agency on June 16, Kissinger said in an interview with the media that Sino-US relations are on &quot;a cliff&quot; and &quot;the current trajectory of the relationship must change.&quot; Later, Kissinger also said that the Cold War between China and the United States is now &quot;walking on a mountain road.&quot; Kissinger believes that China and the United States &quot;both believe that the other side poses a strategic threat. We are moving towards a confrontation between major powers.&quot; This is a process that &quot;should not continue&quot;. Once a conflict breaks out between China and the United States, it will be comparable to World War I. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Therefore, Kissinger actively mediates the conflict between Russia and Ukraine and drags his old body to visit China, which is an attempt to stabilize Sino-US relations and exert his residual energy. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Why Kissinger? &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In the United States, there are many influential strategists. There are also many people who are worried about the international situation and are trying to improve Russia-Ukraine relations and Sino-U.S. relations. But why Kissinger and not someone else? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the one hand, Kissinger has a superstitious admiration and sense of mission for the United States. As a German Jew who escaped the Nazi regime, to hold a high position in the United States is an example of an American success story. This also makes him always grateful to the United States. He once wrote: &quot;The same generosity of spirit and lack of malice can be found anywhere else.&quot; This almost sentimental gratitude and admiration for the United States made him serve the United States at all costs in diplomacy and devote himself to Maximize the national interests of the United States. For this reason, he did not hesitate to sacrifice his personal beliefs and did not care about his personal success or failure, reaching the height of &quot;living and dying for the benefit of the country, how can he avoid it for the sake of misfortunes and blessings&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the other hand, more than half of Kissinger’s diplomatic achievements are in Sino-US relations. Kissinger is an eyewitness and operator of America&#39;s transformation from decline to prosperity. If President Nixon had not accepted his suggestion, destroyed the Sino-Soviet alliance, and shifted the strategic focus of the United States from Asia to Europe, it would have been difficult for the United States to win the Cold War in this way. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When he entered American politics, the United States was experiencing its lowest point after World War II, and was experiencing triple crises of foreign strategy, economy, and society. The United States was trapped in the Vietnam War and was unable to extricate itself; it was in economic difficulties, and the U.S. dollar lost its ability and credibility to redeem gold; domestic society was in chaos. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When Kissinger left American politics, the United States had successfully transformed China from an enemy of the United States into a &quot;friendly non-ally&quot; of the United States against the Soviet Union. Although the U.S. dollar can no longer be redeemed freely with gold, it has been tied back to the oil trade, achieving an upgrade from the U.S. dollar to an international standard currency. The U.S. dollar has transformed from an intermediary in world economic and trade to a truly hegemonic currency and an international standard currency. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These all make Kissinger unique and a myth and legend in the diplomatic community. His status and influence in international politics, especially in Sino-US relations, are irreplaceable. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Symbol of the Times&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;On June 16, 2023, according to Xinhua News Agency, Kissinger said in an interview with the media that American politics is polarized , is currently &quot;overly focused&quot; on its own interests, and if its foreign policy fails to balance the interests of the United States and the world, the United States &quot;will become isolated.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The reason why Sino-US relations turned from hostility to cooperation was that both countries had to deal with the threat from the Soviet Union. However, without Kissinger&#39;s insight and courage, it would be difficult for China-US relations to quickly restart in such a bad bilateral relationship. The symbolic effect produced by this overlapping interaction between individuals and times is something that no one else can possess. Kissinger has become a symbol, a symbol of an era, and is unrepeatable. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Historically, it was a product of the times when China and the United States united to fight against the Soviet Union during difficult times. When Kissinger secretly visited China, it was the Soviet Union&#39;s rise and hardening period, and it was a difficult period for China and the United States. The handshake between China and the United States across the Pacific and across the ideological divide not only created a diplomatic legend, but also stabilized the world situation at the time and destined the outcome of the Cold War in advance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When Kissinger came to China, he saw the strategic contradictions and ideological differences between China and the Soviet Union, and wanted to contact China to jointly fight the Soviet Union. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this sense, China and the United States have become the biggest beneficiaries of the end of the Cold War. After the end of the Cold War, both China and the United States were able to get rid of security concerns, reduce security burdens, and focus on economic development. The rise of China in the world and the rise of the United States within the Western camp complement each other. It can be said that Kissinger&#39;s personal luck lies in standing at a turning point in Sino-US relations and the world structure. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On a personal level, Kissinger is often called a realist, mainly because he puts strategic thinking ahead of ideology. This distinguishes Kissinger from the current strategic researchers in the United States who are guided by ideology. However, he did not take ideological factors into consideration. In fact, he calls his foreign policy principles &quot;liberal internationalism,&quot; which is equivalent to the neoconservatism of the George W. Bush era. It is the product of combining the emphasis on values, internationalist principles, and diplomacy based on national strength. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is precisely because of this kind of liberal internationalism that he offended the two US presidents, Trump and Biden. On November 25, 2020, Trump fired Kissinger from his position as an advisor to the U.S. Defense Policy Council. However, he is also dissatisfied with Biden&#39;s withdrawal from Afghanistan, believing it to be an irresponsible act that betrays the tradition of U.S. foreign policy dating back to President Wilson. One result of expressing this rhetoric is that Biden inherits Trump&#39;s approach to Kissinger. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, there are many talents in the U.S. strategic field, and many of the younger generation of strategic people than Kissinger have also withdrawn from the stage. The young and middle-aged strategic talents in the United States are now leading the charge in the United States. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, age is a major advantage for Kissinger. Kissinger is 100 years old and has outlived all his friends and opponents. Kissinger is the only 100-year-old international politician in the world who is still active and has great influence. This makes Kissinger&#39;s role largely unrepeatable. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Can Kissinger be copied? &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Kissinger is a product of his times. Times cannot be repeated, and Kissinger cannot be copied. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the one hand, the shape of Sino-US relations has changed. During the Cold War, the biggest external threat to China and the United States was the Soviet Union. For the sake of their own security, China and the United States have established a quasi-alliance system across the ideological divide, which is in line with their own interests. Now, as China has unprecedentedly entered the center of the world&#39;s power stage, Sino-US relations have become the most important bilateral relationship. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the other hand, the characteristics of diplomacy have changed. The realists represented by Kissinger advocate personal factors and are superstitious about secret diplomacy. This was already outdated by the end of the Cold War. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Kissinger was obsessed with those passionate years throughout his life, and was intoxicated by the thrill and excitement of secretly boarding a plane from Pakistan to Beijing. In the post-Cold War era, especially in the era of highly transparent and open self-media, these individual heroic diplomatic behaviors are difficult to reproduce. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, Kissinger’s influence in the United States has declined much faster than in China. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the context of the new era, many Americans are also reflecting on and challenging Kissinger&#39;s past contributions and achievements. The famous international relations scholar Hans Morgenthau has long said that Kissinger, like Odysseus in Homer&#39;s epic poem, &quot;has many facades.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the United States, there are two descriptions of Kissinger: one is a liar. This person never tells the truth, always speaks ambiguous words, and almost never makes clear public comments on major events. This may be one of the secrets of his longevity in the world of international relations. Second, Kissinger is an amazing person with an excellent memory. He was an eyewitness and living dictionary of many major events. Christopher Hitchens&#39;s description of Kissinger is perhaps more accurate, calling him &quot;a stunning liar with an incredible memory.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Finally, there is something very dangerous. Compared with Kissinger, whose main achievement was during the Cold War, current American strategists basically grew up in a peaceful atmosphere. For them, peace is no longer the primary goal of international politics, but the premise or background of international politics, which does not need to be fought for or paid for. Therefore, we can see that compared with Kissinger&#39;s concerns about the prospect of conflict, many American strategists seem not to be concerned about the possibility of conflict. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Therefore, there will be no second Kissinger, but the crisis that Kissinger is worried about will continue to repeat itself. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(The author is a professor at the American Studies Center of Fudan University)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 05 Oct 2023 09:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[为啥没有诺贝尔数学奖：因为诺贝尔的妻子被数学家拐跑了？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258076]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-05 08:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;It was not until Nobel&#39;s death in 1896 that his family, friends and colleagues knew that the Swedish billionaire 94% of his property was donated to the foundation to establish 5 awards: Physics Award, Chemistry Award, Physiology or Medicine Award, Literature Award, Peace Award, and held the first award ceremony in 1901 - today, There is also a sixth award, the Nobel Prize in Economics, which was established by the Swedish Central Bank in 1969 to commemorate Nobel, so it is sometimes not regarded as the orthodox Nobel Prize. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Whether it is the five Nobel Prizes or the six Nobel Prizes, mathematics prizes are not included. As for why, you may have heard a legend: Swedish mathematician Gosta Mittag-Leffler kidnapped Nobel&#39;s wife, so Nobel hated everyone who studied mathematics and refused to establish a mathematics prize from the foundation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is actually a complete rumor. Nobel was never married and had no wife at all. In fact, if Nobel had a wife and children, he might not be able to donate his property to the foundation to establish awards. Therefore, in some versions of the story, it was not Nobel&#39;s wife who was abducted, but his lover. However, when we look back at Nobel&#39;s life today, we will find that this extremely wealthy inventor did not have a smooth relationship. His only two scandal targets had nothing to do with mathematicians. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 21, 1833, a baby boy was born to an intellectual family in Stockholm, Sweden. He was named Alfred Nobel. He later became a famous scientist, inventor, and businessman. and founder of the Nobel Prize. His father, Nobel Sr., was a construction engineer with extensive research in the field of rock blasting. Alfred Nobel later embarked on the path of developing explosives and engineering inventions, which was actually his family background. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, in the same year that little Nobel was born, his father&#39;s career was not going well and he went bankrupt due to a construction accident. When he was 4 years old, the old Nobel saw that he could not make money in Sweden, so he decided to go to Finland and Russia to make a living. His wife and children were left behind to guard a small grocery store and eke out a living in Stockholm. As a result, little Nobel lived a very hungry and cold childhood, and did not go to school well. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fortunately, old Nobel finally made a name for himself in Russia. He opened a machine shop in St. Petersburg and designed a new type of simple mine to provide equipment for the Russian army: He asked the Tsar and generals It was believed that the mines could prevent enemy ships from approaching the capital. During the Crimean War from 1853 to 1856, these mines successfully prevented British naval attacks on St. Petersburg. Russia&#39;s earliest central heating device was also manufactured in the old Nobel factory. The Nobel family was the first in Russia to install central heating. This was a big shock to the country of &quot;General Winter&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;With his father&#39;s success in Russia, Nobel&#39;s family moved to St. Petersburg in 1842. Little Nobel, who had not even finished primary school, finally had the opportunity to receive a first-class education. Little Nobel was most interested in literature, chemistry and physics, and left a deep impression on his teachers: he was extremely intelligent but sickly, liked solitude and contemplation, and was particularly fascinated by English literature, especially the poets Byron and Shelley. - As a student, Nobel regarded Shelley&#39;s philanthropy, pacifism, agnosticism and atheism as his guiding principles in life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But the elder Nobel hoped that his sons could inherit their father&#39;s legacy and was dissatisfied with the younger Nobel&#39;s literary ambitions. He then decided to send the young man to study abroad to become a chemical engineer. In this way, the young Nobel came to Paris to study under the famous chemist Peroz. Under Professor Perozzi, he met Sobrero, a young Italian chemist. Three years ago, Sobrero invented nitroglycerin, a highly explosive liquid. Sobrero thought the thing was too dangerous to be of practical use. However, Nobel was very interested in nitroglycerin and believed that it had great future in engineering. After he completed his studies and returned to Russia, he and his father started the research and development of nitroglycerin. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But by then the Crimean War had ended, and my father’s business was deteriorating, and he finally had to move back to Sweden. Nobel&#39;s two brothers remained in Russia, trying to save what was left of the family business. They eventually succeeded, turning to the emerging oil industry in southern Russia. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1863, Nobel returned to Sweden with his father and concentrated on developing nitroglycerin dynamite. Unfortunately, these experiments went awry, resulting in the deaths of several people, including Nobel&#39;s brother Emile. The Swedish government has ordered a ban on explosives testing within the city of Stockholm. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But Nobel did not give up and moved the experiment to a barge on Lake Mälaren in Sweden. In 1866, his experiments finally achieved a breakthrough: by mixing nitroglycerin with a type of fine sand called diatomaceous earth, the liquid could be turned into a paste, and dynamite sticks could be made. He also incidentally invented the detonator, which could be detonated by lighting a fuse. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Unlike his father who studied mines, Nobel, as a pacifist, put these inventions into civilian fields, such as drilling tunnels, blasting rocks, and building canals. The invention of explosives and detonators greatly reduced project costs and immediately became popular in the construction industry. Nobel therefore set up factories in 90 different places, but demand still exceeded supply. He lived in Paris but frequently traveled to his factories in more than 20 countries, earning him the nickname &quot;Europe&#39;s richest tramp&quot; by Victor Hugo. He also developed synthetic rubber, leather and rayon, and obtained 355 patents in his lifetime, making him a veritable invention king. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Intensive work and travel left this inventor with no time to solve personal problems, and he has always been a bachelor. It was not until the age of 43 that Nobel hired Bertha Kinski, a multilingual and well-educated Austrian housekeeper. Nobel fell in love with her at first sight, but Bertha already had a crush on her. After working for Nobel for a short period of time, she decided to return to Austria to marry her fiancé. Despite this, Nobel and Bertha became good friends and continued to write to each other for decades. Bertha was a well-known anti-war activist and wrote the masterpiece &quot;Lay Down Your Arms&quot;. She had a great influence on Nobel, not only strengthening Nobel&#39;s pacifist belief, but also the key to Nobel&#39;s final establishment of the Peace Prize. After Nobel&#39;s death, the Norwegian Parliament awarded the 1905 Nobel Peace Prize to Bertha. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Nobel’s second relationship originated from a commercial trip in the autumn of 1876. Nobel came to Austria and met the poor and beautiful girl Sophia. Nobel was attracted by her frankness and beauty, and Sophia was attracted by Nobel&#39;s money - it was obvious that this relationship was doomed to tragedy from the beginning. Nobel loved and cared for Sophia, gave her money, spent time teaching her, and tried to improve her moral character and knowledge, but to no avail. Sofia became more and more willful and took up a lover in the luxurious Paris apartment prepared for her by Nobel. Nobel decided to break up several times, but he couldn&#39;t stand Sophia&#39;s entanglement and indulged her willfulness year after year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since his student days, Nobel has been introverted and lonely, and was once hospitalized for treatment for depression. Continuous emotional difficulties aggravated his illness, so much so that he once wrote: &quot;Only in dogs can you find many friends.&quot; In his later years, Nobel suffered from hearing problems and angina, and the doctor recommended that he take nitric acid Glycerin - this is the explosive ingredient that made him famous. Nobel complained in a letter to his relatives and friends: &quot;It seems like an irony of fate that they prescribed nitroglycerin for oral administration to me!&quot; To this day, nitroglycerin is still an effective drug for the treatment of acute angina. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the spring of 1891, just five years before Nobel&#39;s death, Sophia wrote him another letter asking for money on the grounds that she was pregnant. But Nobel knew that the child&#39;s father was a young Hungarian officer, and the two were preparing to get married. The main source of income for this young couple after their marriage was shamelessly writing to Nobel asking for a huge sum of money - and in Nobel&#39;s will, he actually took out a large sum of money from the remaining 6%. To Sophia. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for the Swedish mathematician Gosta Mittag-Leffler who is rumored to have kidnapped Nobel’s wife, he was 13 years younger than Nobel. When Nobel moved to France, he was still there. go to school. Gosta had nothing to do with Nobel throughout his life, but he had a lot to do with the Nobel Prize: he was elected as a member of the Nobel Prize Committee in 1903, and insisted on awarding the Nobel Prize to Curie against all odds. A couple, not Mr. Curie alone. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 05 Oct 2023 08:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[奇峰峻岭“外星谷”丨指尖华夏⑥]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257589]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-04 23:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;The Alien Valley Interstellar Theme Geopark has protruding peaks, rugged rock pillars, steep ridges and colorful mountains.

You would think that those salesmen you meet in a noisy restaurant who are engrossed in eating with their colleagues, wearing short-sleeved white shirts day after day, and thinking about which shared bicycle monthly pass to buy when they leave, behind the lean and ordinary appearance In fact, they are all experts at experiencing life. They absorb everything around them delicately and keenly, and when they return to their shared home, they all become Kafka. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Crashing into the Sky&quot; is a novel published in August 2023. The protagonist in the book is a clerk working in downtown Guangzhou. The pen name of the person who wrote it is You Yu. He is in his early 30s and is naturally also known as I think I have had similar experiences. Of course, he also took some classes that were neither salty nor bland, and also ran a restaurant selling braised chicken. But when he started writing this novel with a rich sense of place, it had only been two or three years since he moved to Guangzhou, and he had only a few encounters with the streets that appear repeatedly in the story. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;With no intention of finding a job, he decided to come to Guangzhou to live a low-cost creative life with the money he earned from opening a restaurant. After inspecting several district libraries, and taking into account the environment, the flow of people, and the rent, he rented one at the terminus of the subway line and went to the nearby Huangpu District Library from nine to five every day to write. According to the air-conditioning vents in the four seasons, The scenery outside the window changes the favorite seats in the museum, listening to Bach&#39;s unaccompanied cello suites, and constructing the life of office workers 30 kilometers away. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is completely different from the type of novelist who needs to be rooted in a strange environment for a long time before he can write confidently. In his eyes, the external life that others try to figure out is like being covered with a tight and difficult-to-remove plastic film. Transparent and fragile bubbles that pop when poked. While shopping, he felt that his brain was uncontrollably breaking through physical boundaries, spreading and landing on everything around him. Buildings, chairs, and even the moving light spots on a small leaf were all sending information to him in a steady stream. . It is so abundant that it can even become a burden, causing you to almost collapse every time you go home. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After starting to write, he finally found a way to release. Occasionally speaking about this &quot;trouble&quot;, he seemed to tentatively wipe the dust on the cabinet wall with his index finger. Only when he saw a clumsy and obvious trace did he realize, oh, it turns out that other people are different from me. Critic Li Jing fully felt his &quot;idiosyncrasies&quot; and described him as being like a radar, always in a state of sensing the situation around him. &quot;And he seems to be completely unable to ignore any kind of information or any kind of situation. He can react in his mind at any time, and express this reaction in a particularly precise, poetic language.&quot; She called him &quot;The opposite of Medusa&quot; means that wherever he looks, all solid objects dissolve into living, liquid or gaseous objects, becoming music, birds, and life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When you think back, this &quot;special ability&quot; seems to have nothing to do with location. He could not escape this experience in his hometown in Henan when he was studying and in Shanghai when he was working. The division in time is even more obvious. &quot;The moment I learned that my mother died in a car accident, my hearing seemed to be different all of a sudden. There were dozens of people around, and everyone was talking, but I could hear them all. What are you talking about? I cried all of a sudden, but actually I didn’t feel sad in my heart. What happened to death? Many people around me praised me for being sensible and knowing how to cry. Instead, they gave me a kind of encouragement and made me cry. Even harder, letting me know that I should cry even more. Before, as a child, the entire adult world was actually surrounded by a wall, but after that, you will feel that the dam collapsed all of a sudden, and it poured directly into my body like a flood ( (in front of me). I have personally experienced the changes in every relationship, not only with family members, but also with anyone in the surrounding environment. Everything is changing. This change made me particularly clearly aware of how to come up with a relationship that is consistent with the situation. Everyone is expecting it, but in fact I know in my heart that I am performing for everyone to see.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For fear of disturbing others, his already low volume was lowered. From the first floor to the second floor, we changed seats three times, but we still couldn&#39;t escape the fate of being overwhelmed by the sound, other people&#39;s conversations, and the static of the coffee machine. With an anxious mood, I struggled to salvage his weak response - I had sold insurance, managed the Tmall flagship store of a pet company, had outstanding performance in after-sales work at a software sales company, and had to deal with endless abuse from customers. He was very patient, but when his boss promoted him to lead the team, he resigned decisively. He regards work as a mechanical performance, &quot;I just don&#39;t believe in evil and still have to do it. In fact, I am just avoiding writing.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When faced with questions, he rarely responds directly, with a novelist&#39;s narrative The rhythm is not as simple as taking a small detour, but going straight to a completely unrelated route, suddenly braking when you are not sure whether you will come back - &quot;I&#39;ll tell you from the beginning.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt; h4>;Avoid writing&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You have wanted to write a long time ago ?

I have loved reading since I could learn to read, but at that time we couldn&#39;t afford books. Apart from textbooks, I read wherever I can see words, such as fertilizer bags, ingredient lists on pesticide labels, and opening paper balls. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The first time I read a book was probably after my mother passed away. She passed away when I was in the fourth grade of elementary school. My sisters were in junior high school at that time, and they brought books back several times on the weekends, including &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; and &quot;Jane Eyre.&quot; At that time, I didn&#39;t understand much about romance and didn&#39;t remember the specific plot. After watching it, I felt that these people were weird and interesting, and they were different from the people around me. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Do you still remember the feeling of reading a book at that time? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;You Yu: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;The clearest feeling is &quot;War and Peace&quot;. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When I entered junior high school—I lived on campus at that time—I would ride a few kilometers to the school in the town every Sunday evening. In the beginning, I had to use meal tickets to eat at school. I had to carry a bag of wheat to the flour mill next to the school and give it to the cooperative flour mill. I then took the note to the accountant and exchanged it for meal tickets. When I was in the second grade of junior high school, the price of food seemed to have gone up a bit. My dad did some math and thought it might be more cost-effective to give me money, so he gave me only 10 yuan a week. But he didn&#39;t realize that I was growing stronger and my appetite had increased. (I) was hungry every meal. I knew it was very difficult to make money at that time, so I didn’t say anything. Occasionally, I can have a good meal at my aunt&#39;s house, so now that I see my dear aunt, I still feel full and feel very at ease. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Once we entered a bookstore, there were pirated books by Li Liang and Gu Long everywhere, while those by Tolstoy and Hugo were shivering in the corner. I definitely couldn&#39;t afford it at that time, not even more than one yuan. After all, I wouldn&#39;t even have enough to eat. I don’t know how I saved a few dollars in the end. Maybe a few months later, I bought two books before the summer vacation. One was &quot;War and Peace&quot; and the other one I really can’t remember. After I bought it, I opened it and found that the first page was densely packed with words and a lot of French. At that time, it rained continuously and the sky was covered with rain. The ground is covered with yellow water, branches are sometimes blown off, and the sound of rain is mixed with the sound of the last cicadas in late summer and the screams of young birds after their nests are blown away. Under these sounds, I watched &quot;War and Peace&quot; on the lounge chair in the main room without realizing it was dark. My dad came out of nowhere and said it was so dark it was ruining his eyesight. Because the wires were broken at that time, I moved to the porch at the door until I saw that there was no light at all. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When I woke up the next morning, I could see the words again.

Perhaps when these four unite to become a complete one, that is truly true. If this were the case, I might not hate myself so much.

After writing, I didn’t think people would need me to talk about myself. Maybe they just needed to talk about how I wrote.

Why was this? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Especially at that time, it was the first time I really met readers and looked at their faces. Before, I had been writing alone in the library. After the conversation, a girl came to me and asked me. She said that she was also writing, but was a little confused. At that time, I realized that although my answer might not have that big an impact, it might have a small impact. This thing makes me feel quite panicked and scared. I tried my best to tell what I was sincere about, so that I would not be so panicked. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I didn’t actually love literature before. The reason why I wrote it was because it was indeed a way I could find for me to get along with the world, others, and myself.

Many books clearly understand people so deeply, so why do people still use such simple terms? way to understand people? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I felt quite empty at the end of &quot;Crashing into the Sky&quot;. At that time, I thought of a long theme, and wanted to write about a person&#39;s 20 or 30 years in a chronological style, but I was When I was sorting through it, I found that there was a person in it who seemed to be a good novella. Then I started writing that, but during that time the library was not allowed in, so I wrote in my room. At that time, I was suffering from rhinitis all the time, and later I was infected with the new coronavirus. I had a fever for five days and died in pain. During that process, it took maybe two or three months to finish writing the novella, which was about 40,000 words. In fact, it’s something I don’t want to publish, and I don’t want to show it to others. After I finished writing, a friend happened to ask me. She said she just wanted to read something and asked me if I had any. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She goes to work, doesn&#39;t write anything, and hasn&#39;t watched &quot;The Sky&quot;. I showed her the novella with mother and daughter as the main line. It was posted in the afternoon, but she finished reading it in the evening and said that she felt very blocked and uncomfortable. After that, she called her mother, and the two cried bitterly on the phone for the first time. For the first time, she heard her mother talk about her youth, her love and her emotions when she was simply a woman. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I don’t think my writing was very good, or that it really played such a big role. Maybe it gave her an opportunity at that point in time, and she was finally willing to have that kind of communication with her mother. If what I write has a little effect on such a specific person, I will feel a little comfort in my heart. She and her mother have maintained relatively good communication since then.

After I woke up, I slowly wrote a poem. A man lives in Guangzhou, but when he closes his eyes, he will have another identity, a story about going to Saili Shilong Cave. After I finished writing it, I realized that it was just a man&#39;s self-pity and pretentiousness. Taken alone, at least for me, I couldn&#39;t accept it and it was untenable.

On September 29, the official website of Northwest Normal University issued a notice stating that the school’s “serious work errors by staff” resulted in “the number of announced postgraduate students being recommended for exemption exceeds the quota for the recommendation plan.” After discovering the problem, the school withdrew the quota for the excess exemption plan and explained to the affected students. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Han Yong (pseudonym), the student involved, said that the publicity period was from September 20th to 29th, and they were only informed of the &quot;recruitment for postgraduate qualifications&quot; on the afternoon of the 28th, the day before the end of the publicity period. got canceled&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Insurance Research Incident” and “Research Qualification Cancellation” have become the hot search titles of this incident. However, there are still many factual details that need to be clarified in this incident, and it cannot be simply classified as an &quot;accident&quot; or even a &quot;shady incident.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Recommended exemption from examination&quot; and &quot;successful admission&quot; in postgraduate studies are two completely different concepts. This point was intentionally or unintentionally blurred in media reports, which also made the direction of the incident somewhat out of focus. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Generally speaking, senior students seeking postgraduate study must first seek exemption qualifications from their own school before they can apply for pre-admission qualifications from their own school or other schools. At the same time, there are still divisions in the admission methods of the postgraduate entrance examination such as &quot;summer camp&quot;, &quot;pre-recommendation exemption&quot; and &quot;nine recommendation&quot; (exemption in September). In terms of acceptance units, there are also &quot;internal protection&quot; (our school) and &quot;external recommendation&quot; (other schools). ) difference. The priority of summer camp and pre-recommendation exemption is higher than that of &quot;nine promotions&quot;, and &quot;internal protection&quot; is more certain than &quot;external promotion&quot;. These are subdivided tracks in the &quot;protection research world&quot;, and each competition The rules of the Tao game are also different and cannot be generalized. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this &quot;recruitment accident&quot;, the &quot;disqualified&quot; students participated in the &quot;September Exemption&quot;, which is referred to as the &quot;Nine Promotions&quot;. According to the &quot;Notice on Recommending Excellent Fresh Undergraduates to Study for Master&#39;s Degrees Without Examination in 2024&quot; released on the official website of Northwest Normal University on September 16, the timetable for this promotion is &quot;Students apply on September 17, 9 From September 17th to 20th, the college will recommend, and the school will review it on September 20th.&quot; Then it is &quot;from September 20th to 29th, the school will publicize the list of proposed recommendations, and the publicity period will be 10 days.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to the general exemptions, Northwest Normal University’s notice on September 16 also announced other types of “September exemptions”, such as the “Bachelor-Master Integration” special program, “Counselor Program” &quot;Special Program&quot;, &quot;Rural School Education Master Teacher Training Program&quot; (referred to as &quot;Agricultural Master&quot;), &quot;Graduate Education Support Team&quot; special program, etc. are recommended to exempt enrollment plans. Among them, the recommendation work for “counselor special projects” is the responsibility of the Student Affairs Department of the Party Committee and belongs to the “Administrative Research Guarantee in Colleges and Universities”. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to &quot;Zongpan News&quot; quoting the student involved, Xiao Hong (pseudonym), more than 100 students were affected by this &quot;accident&quot;, and they mainly applied for the &quot;Undergraduate and Master&#39;s Integrated Excellent Middle School&quot; There are two promotion projects: &quot;Teacher&quot; and &quot;Counselor Special&quot;. China News Network’s report also showed that the two students interviewed applied for the “Counselor Special Program” and were subsequently disqualified. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The notice shows that the &quot;Counselor Special Program&quot; is recommended by the Party Committee&#39;s Academic Affairs Department, and the academic system is &quot;1+Basic Academic System&quot;. After graduating from senior year, students must be full-time counselors for one year; &quot;Bachelor and Master&#39;s Integration&quot; The selection process is limited to the college and the receiving major, and a training agreement needs to be signed. The academic system is &quot;3+1+2&quot;, that is, three years for undergraduates, one year for transition, and two years for the master&#39;s degree in education. At least judging from the literal meaning of this document, the school has greater discretion and decision-making power over the admissions of these two internal postgraduate programs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Pushing the issue to this point, based on the existing information, it is not difficult to conclude that there is indeed a possibility that the school made a mistake, that is, the school staff &quot;slid&quot;, allowing two &quot;internal graduate protection of the school&quot; projects The announced number of graduate students recommended for exemption exceeds the number of places in the recommendation plan, resulting in an excess quota. The key lies in how the planned quota of the disqualified postgraduate program is calculated, whether it is included in the total quota, and whether the school has the right to cancel it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A &quot;Boya Database&quot; published by Northwest Normal University on September 16 released the &quot;2024 Excellent Fresh Undergraduate Graduates Recommended Master&#39;s Degree Distribution Table&quot; shows that Northwest Normal University&#39;s &quot;2024 Class of There are 702 postgraduate positions, which is a significant increase from the previous session (641 people).&quot; Among them, 35 people are planned to be admitted to the &quot;Counselor Special Program&quot; and as many as 100 people are planned to be admitted to the &quot;Bachelor-Master Integrated Special Program&quot;. And these 702 people do not include the &quot;counselor specialization&quot;. Can it be said that the &quot;counselor special project&quot; itself is somewhat &quot;supernumerary&quot; in nature, so the school has the right to handle it flexibly? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The quotas for the &quot;Counselor Special Program&quot; and &quot;Bachelor-Master&#39;s Integrated Program&quot; last year were 40 and 60 respectively. It can be seen that this year, the number of places for the &quot;Counselor Special Program&quot; has decreased while the number of places for the &quot;Integrated Bachelor&#39;s and Master&#39;s Program&quot; has increased. After the &quot;accident&quot;, Zhao Qin (pseudonym) said in an interview with China News Network that &quot;it was the middle part that was disqualified&quot; because &quot;Nongshuo has signed a contract and the deal is done, so we can only cancel ours.&quot; Han Yong also said that &quot;all counselors in our college who have been specially guaranteed for postgraduate study have been disqualified.&quot; This detail also shows that the contract signing time and formal enrollment for the &quot;Counselor Special Program&quot; are later. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At what point in time did the mistake of &quot;excess public announcement of personnel&quot; occur? Why is there overstaffing? On what basis were the personnel quotas for the two affected research protection projects determined to be &quot;excess&quot;? Are the only over-subscribed projects the “counselor specialization” and “undergraduate and master’s degree integration”? Or could it be said that the school does have greater discretion over the two &quot;internally guaranteed postgraduate programs within the school&quot; and has the right to cancel or change the enrollment plan during the list publicity period? The answers to these questions will determine whether the nature of the &quot;accident&quot; is just a work error or a procedural breach of trust. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Therefore, the school should answer the specific details of the &quot;excess number of students found&quot; and announce to the outside world the specific rules of the several &quot;our school&#39;s postgraduate protection&quot; projects affected this time. In this way, it will be clear at a glance whether it is a mistake or a breach of trust. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 04 Oct 2023 21:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[指定居所监视居住，不能走样变形丨法眼]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258078]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-04 20:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/04/uhg2cLvAxVLP9h2Z4iB0ZrIzgaZpOHEBlp6IYrBu.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1269&quot; height=&quot;951&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/04/uhg2cLvAxVLP9h2Z4iB0ZrIzgaZpOH EBlp6IYrBu. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252997&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On September 14, 2023, on the first floor of Xinle Hotel, Xinle City, Hebei Province, there are The four walls of the room are all soft walls.

He was taken away from his home in Yuhua District.

Residential surveillance shall be carried out by the local public security police station, or by an entrusted The people&#39;s commune and the unit where the defendant works shall be implemented.&quot; At that time, suspects and defendants were collectively referred to as &quot;defendants&quot;, and residential surveillance measures did not distinguish between &quot;residences&quot; where they lived. Judging from the application of this measure, residential surveillance is a non-custodial measure. Although the scope of activities of suspects and defendants is restricted, their personal freedom is not deprived. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1996, when the Criminal Procedure Law was revised, residential surveillance measures separated a &quot;residential residence&quot; from the residential surveillance that restricts personal freedom, and was used for suspects and defendants who &quot;have no fixed residence&quot; The suspects and defendants are required to &quot;not leave their designated residence without approval&quot; and the scope of their personal freedom is narrowed to &quot;the designated residence&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From the semantic point of view of the legal provisions, &quot;not leaving without permission&quot; is a restriction on the person who is &quot;designated to live&quot;. The suspects and defendants still have personal freedom to &quot;leave&quot; the designated residence. The possibility, that is, not being completely deprived, probably belongs to a kind of &quot;house arrest.&quot; However, in practice, being &quot;resident&quot; is no longer the original meaning of &quot;residential surveillance&quot;, but has become a kind of detention, which is just different from being detained in a detention center like detention or arrest. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2012, the Criminal Procedure Law was revised again, and the conditions for release on bail pending trial and residential surveillance were separated. Only those who meet the arrest conditions and legal circumstances can be released on bail pending trial. Article 73 of the law stipulates: &quot;Residential surveillance shall be carried out after the crime has been committed.&quot; The execution may be carried out at the residence of the suspect or defendant; if there is no fixed residence, the execution may be carried out at a designated residence. For suspected crimes endangering national security, crimes of leaving terrorist activities, or particularly serious bribery crimes, execution at the residence may hinder the investigation, after the previous With the approval of the People&#39;s Procuratorate at the highest level and the public security organ, enforcement can also be carried out in a designated residence. However, it cannot be carried out in a place of detention or a special case handling place.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So far, the legislation has tacitly approved the use of residential surveillance in a designated residence as a form of surveillance. This hidden meaning can also be seen in the practice of various detention measures, and the applicable conditions for residential surveillance are closer to the conditions for arrest. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this way, residential surveillance has changed from a non-custodial measure to a custodial measure, and the suspects and defendants who have been &quot;residenced&quot; are deprived of their personal freedom. Not only that, the place of residential surveillance has also become a place of interrogation. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Become &lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>; a temporary “case handling place” &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Article 73 of the Criminal Procedure Law stipulates that “it shall not be used in places of detention, specialized It is not prohibited to turn a residence under designated residential surveillance into a temporary &quot;case-handling place&quot;. In fact, the measure of residential surveillance has become an investigative measure to obtain confessions due to the designated residence. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This combination of detention and interrogation means that for the case-handling agency, the interrogation conducted at the designated residence is subject to few external constraints, and the interrogation process is conducive to the control and regulation of the case-handling personnel. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Interrogation is conducted in a confined space outside a detention center. If the rights of criminal suspects and defendants are not to be infringed, they must submit obediently and provide the confessions expected by the investigators on a tap; or the investigators must comply with the interrogation. Standardize and consciously restrain the inertia and impulse of illegal evidence collection. When criminal suspects and defendants are not docile and actively cooperate, torture, torture, and corporal punishment and abuse can easily occur. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since the place of &quot;residence&quot; is also a temporary &quot;case handling place&quot;, the case handlers in the pre-trial stage also become caretakers. Therefore, eliminating outside interference has become an inevitable choice. Not only are close relatives of people under such residential surveillance not allowed to meet with them, even lawyers are not allowed to meet with them, and they cannot even know where the criminal suspects or defendants are designated to live. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The defense lawyer complained that the accused residents’ rights to lawyers were not even as good as those of criminal suspects and defendants when they were detained in the detention center, because criminal suspects and defendants could still meet with their lawyers in the detention center. , but they are not allowed to meet him while under residential surveillance, creating a reality that is obviously disproportionate to the principle of proportionality. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is worth noting that the close relatives of the accused resident are not informed of their designated place during the pretrial proceedings. Article 161 of the Supreme People&#39;s Court&#39;s &quot;Interpretation on the Application of the Criminal Procedure Law of the People&#39;s Republic of China&quot; Paragraph 2 stipulates that the close relatives of the parties should be notified of the reason and location of residence. This is because after investigation, review and prosecution of the case, it is no longer necessary to obtain confessions from the defendant outside the court. Therefore, the details of the coercive measures taken have also changed. The accusation without the function of obtaining confessions is undoubtedly closer to the essence of residential surveillance. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;The non-custodial nature should be returned&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;According to the name, if &quot;resident residence&quot; is still a &quot;residential surveillance&quot; measure, it should be related to the custodial measure. Essentially different, not just a formal and meaningful difference in the form of a place of detention. In other words, people under residential surveillance should have a certain degree of personal freedom. If this freedom is completely deprived, it is a measure of detention rather than residential surveillance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although nothing can be seen from the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Law itself, in actual case handling, residential surveillance at a designated location has indeed lost its essence of residential surveillance and has become a detention measure. During the Republic of my country, the Criminal Procedure Law of our country already included &quot;residential surveillance&quot;. This measure existed as an alternative to detention, or as a measure to release from detention. The current residential surveillance is slightly different from the word order, but the nature of this measure is originally the same. Confusing residential surveillance with detention measures, even though there are differences in detention places, is still a flaw in the design of the criminal justice system or an act that exceeds legal boundaries in judicial practice. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Personal freedom is a basic human right second only to the right to life and health, and is guaranteed by the solemn commitment of the Constitution. Personal freedom is not absolute. Personal freedom can be restricted or deprived for the needs of social defense, the need for litigation and evidence preservation, the need for the personal preservation of the person being prosecuted, and as a penalty measure. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, deprivation of personal freedom—whether as a social defense measure, a litigation safeguard measure, or a punishment method—needs to go through legal due process, that is, it is decided by the judicial authority, which leads to the judicial monopoly of the power of imprisonment. Sexuality and inalienability, non-judicial authorities may not deprive personal liberty for the above purposes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is worth noting that the deprivation of personal liberty stipulated in the Constitution as a protective measure appears with the word &quot;arrest&quot;. &quot;Arrest&quot; in the Constitution cannot be understood as an arrest in various coercive measures in criminal proceedings. It should be understood in a broad sense, that is, any arrest substance, no matter what the name is, will be regarded as an &quot;arrest&quot; in the Constitution and must be carried out in accordance with the Constitution. The prescribed restrictions are implemented - approval or decision of the People&#39;s Procuratorate and decision of the People&#39;s Court. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The deprivation of personal freedom as a protective measure in our country ignores the broad nature of &quot;arrest&quot; in the Constitution. In addition to arrest, there are many personal freedoms that have the same essence as arrest but do not appear in the name of arrest. Deprivation measures have caused the constitutional guarantee of personal freedom to become undistributed in practice. Zhiju refers to a detention measure that is not in the name of &quot;arrest&quot; and is not held in a detention place but has the same essence as arrest. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The death of Bao Qinrui gives us the opportunity to examine the custodialization of residential surveillance and let us think: we should return residential surveillance to its non-custodial nature and avoid confusing its essence with custodial measures. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 04 Oct 2023 20:25:05 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[史上首次，美国“三号人物”被投票罢免]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258082]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-04 19:26:21&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;video id=&quot;contents-video-0&quot; data-fileid=&quot;5576678021854946024&quot; data-media=&quot; video&quot; data-resource=&quot;tencent&quot; data-filename=&quot;For the first time in history, the &quot;No. 3&quot; figure in the United States was voted out of office.mp4&quot; data-cover=&quot;http://1251434507.vod2.myqcloud.com/d9dca36avodtranscq1251434507/543d88ee5576678021854946024/sampleSnapshot /sampleSnapshot_10_0.jpg&quot; data-url=&quot;http://1251434507.vod2.myqcloud.com/02f2b5c2vodcq1251434507/543d88ee5576678021854946024/bJQdQltDrtQA.mp4&quot; poster=&quot;&quot; controls=&quot;controls&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height =&quot;360&quot;>; &lt;source src=&quot;http://1251434507.vod2.myqcloud.com/02f2b5c2vodcq1251434507/543d88ee5576678021854946024/bJQdQltDrtQA.mp4&quot; type=&quot;video/mp4&quot;>;&lt;/video>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 04 Oct 2023 19:55:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[全红婵 陈芋汐：神仙姐妹交相辉映]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258068]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-04 18:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/04/ssInabNEeMfdv7wu3WdauUzBwGZTGEBjjefNE7g7.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/04/ssInabNEeMfdv7wu3WdauUzBwGZTGEBjjefNE7 g7. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252991&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On September 30, 2023, the women&#39;s synchronized 10-meter platform final of the diving event at the Hangzhou Asian Games , the champion Chinese combination Quan Hongchan (right) and Chen Yuxi (left) at the award ceremony &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>; (Xinhua News Agency/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In the women&#39;s single 10-meter platform final of the Asian Games held on the afternoon of October 3, 2023, Quan Hongchan reproduced the &quot;splash disappearing technique&quot; and won the championship with 438.20 points.

Quan Hongchan has always danced very well before. The problem is that she has grown taller and her position For female divers, development difficulties must be faced.&quot; He Weiyi, Quan Hongchan&#39;s head coach of the Guangdong Provincial Team, analyzed in a post-match review. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the two years since the Tokyo Olympics, Quan Hongchan has grown 7 centimeters in height and gained weight, which is a difficult problem for divers. Zhou Jihong, the current leader of the national diving team, once pointed out that the women&#39;s 10-meter platform has extremely strict requirements on the height and weight of athletes. Among all diving events, this is the one with the most frequent and cruel personnel iterations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Perhaps the most typical positive example is Quan Hongchan’s current head coach and former Olympic diving champion Chen Ruolin. Beginning in 2010, 18-year-old Chen Ruolin began to diet in order to prevent her physical development from interfering with her diving career. She only ate one full meal a day all year round and persisted for 6 years until she retired. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the Tokyo Olympics, He Weiyi once expressed concern about Quan Hongchan, &quot;Her natural sense of strength is fully capable of helping her through the growth period, but the premise of all this is: she needs enough Self-disciplined and using very strict standards to control her weight.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for the title of &quot;genius&quot;, He Weiyi does not agree, &quot;People on the Internet praise her too highly.

The topic of UFOs and aliens has always been a hot topic of public concern, triggering continuous discussions and becoming a classic theme in science fiction works. At the same time, scientists are also trying to use scientific methods to study this field and look beyond the earth to search for signs of life on exoplanets. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Remains of extraterrestrial creatures&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Farce&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;There are endless revelations about aliens around the world, most of which are due to lack of evidence. Can&#39;t make much of a splash. However, the appearance of the remains of two suspected &quot;alien creatures&quot; at a hearing in the Mexican Congress attracted widespread attention from the media and the public. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On September 12, 2023, local time, the Mexican Congress held the first public hearing related to the &quot;Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena, UAP&quot; in the capital, Mexico City. At this hearing, Mexican journalist, author and UFO enthusiast Jaime Maussan presented his &quot;discovery&quot; of the remains of two suspected &quot;alien creatures&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to Mozan, the two remains were discovered in a diatom mine in Cusco, Peru, in 2017. After dating by the National Autonomous University of Mexico, the two remains were dated 1,800 years ago. years and 700 years. As can be seen from the pictures at the scene, the remains have an elongated head and three fingers on each hand. The appearance of the two remains is very similar to the alien images described in some science fiction works, causing heated discussions on social media. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Mossan stated: &quot;These two remains have nothing to do with humans.&quot; However, the &quot;alien creatures&quot; mentioned by Moosang immediately aroused huge doubts. This is not the first time that Moissan has thrown out similar news. In 2015, Mossan claimed to have discovered the remains of a suspected &quot;alien creature&quot; in Peru and held a ticketed tour. However, the remains were later confirmed to be the mummified remains of a child. In 2017, Mozan claimed to have discovered the remains of &quot;alien creatures&quot; in the Nazca region of Peru, but was immediately refuted by Peruvian officials. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The so-called &quot;evidence&quot; Moissan gave this time is also unconvincing. In response to Mosan&#39;s statement, the National Accelerator Mass Spectrometry Laboratory of the National Autonomous University of Mexico re-issued a statement that was first released in 2017. The laboratory said in a statement that they were not involved in collecting the samples and had not seen the entire specimen. Therefore, they were only responsible for testing the age of the samples submitted for inspection and would not draw conclusions about the source of the samples. Mosang also claimed that he invited forensic doctors to use X-ray scanning technology to examine the remains and found that there were egg-like structures in the remains. Julieta Fierro, a scientist at the Astronomy Research Center of the National Autonomous University of Mexico, criticized this, saying that more advanced technology than X-ray scanning would be needed to determine whether the two remains were human. Antígona Segura, an astrobiologist at the Nuclear Science Research Center of the National Autonomous University of Mexico, even said: &quot;These conclusions are not supported by evidence at all. The whole thing is shameful.&quot;&lt;/p >; &lt;p>;The Mexican Congress held this hearing to discuss the AirSpace Protection Law (AirSpace Protection Law) and promote relevant legislation. If this law is passed, Mexico will become the first country in the world to recognize &quot;extraterrestrial life forms&quot; &quot;Country that exists. However, after the hearing, the Mexican Congress did not provide conclusive opinions, and the future of this bill is still unclear. Sergio Gutierrez, a member of the Mexican Congress, said: &quot;We are paying attention to this issue and we can continue to discuss it.&quot; However, after being criticized by the scientific community, Moissan&#39;s &quot;discovery&quot; this time There is a high probability that it will end hastily again. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;New &lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Report&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;When the remains of &quot;alien creatures&quot; once again arouse people&#39;s attention to extraterrestrial creatures, The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) held a press conference at its headquarters in Washington, DC, on September 14, 2023, local time, and released the latest research report of an independent research team formed by the agency to study unknown anomalies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;NASA defines &quot;unidentified anomalies&quot; as &quot;observations in the sky that cannot be scientifically identified as aircraft or known natural phenomena.&quot; On June 9, 2022, NASA announced the establishment of this research team. The team is composed of 16 experts from different fields such as astronomy, physics, meteorology, etc. These disciplines have varying degrees of connection with the study of unknown anomalies. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;NASA believes that researchers have now obtained a certain number of high-quality observations of unknown abnormal events, and have the basic conditions to draw solid scientific conclusions about the nature of these events. Therefore, NASA established this independent research group to examine unidentified anomalies from a scientific perspective and develop a roadmap for how to use data and scientific tools to advance our understanding of unidentified anomalies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The public can download the 36-page report from NASA&#39;s official website. The report consists of several parts: the first part briefly introduces the research team and this report, the middle part answers questions such as how the team conducted the research in the form of 8 questions and answers, and the last part is the conclusions, suggestions and Acknowledgments. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The research team concluded in this report that there is currently no evidence to support the existence of aliens, and most UFO incidents can be explained by science. But at the same time, they haven&#39;t completely ruled out the possibility of aliens. While the conclusions are not unexpected, the report is important in suggesting what possible data NASA could collect in the future to explore the nature and origins of unidentified anomalies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In a press release, NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said: &quot;At NASA, it&#39;s in our DNA to explore and ask why things are the way they are. I would like to express my gratitude to the independent research team for inspiring us on how to better study and analyze unidentified anomalies in the future.&quot; He also emphasized that NASA&#39;s goal is to shift people&#39;s discussion of unidentified anomalies from fantasy to science level. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At a press conference, NASA said that it has appointed a new director of unidentified anomaly research, who will lead the research team to strengthen artificial intelligence in the process of collecting and analyzing data and the use of machine learning. The report also highlights the need to enhance the application of new technologies in future research. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;The answer may be on extrasolar planets&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Planet&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Efforts to find alien life on Earth are based on the fact that alien life has visited the Earth. Such a premise limits the search scope to intelligent creatures capable of reaching the earth. But just as life forms on Earth vary widely, if there is life elsewhere in the universe, it may not be intelligent life, but rudimentary forms like microorganisms on Earth. So when astronomers set their sights on the search for exoplanets, they will be on the lookout for any possible signs of life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On September 11, 2023, at the James Webb Space Telescope’s first year of operation meeting held in Baltimore, Maryland, the United States, an international research team led by the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom announced the results of a famous satellite. This is the latest research result of the exoplanet K2-18&amp;nbsp;b. They found methane and carbon dioxide in the planet&#39;s atmosphere. This is the first time astronomers have found carbon-based molecules in the atmosphere of an exoplanet located in the habitable zone. At the same time, they may also have discovered what is believed to be a chemical on Earth. Chemical substances related to life activities. The research results will also be published in the Astrophysical Journal Letters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This exoplanet is 120 light-years away from the Earth, has a mass about 8.6 times that of the Earth, and a radius 2.6 times that of the Earth. It orbits the cold dwarf star K2-18 and is located in the habitable zone of this system. . Astronomers first probed the planet&#39;s atmosphere using the Hubble Space Telescope, but its composition was controversial at the time. After research, astronomers classified this planet into a category of exoplanets called &quot;Hycean exoplanet&quot;. Such planets have hydrogen-rich atmospheres and ocean-covered planetary surfaces. There are no planets of this size between Earth and Neptune in our solar system. Since then, they have used the James Webb Space Telescope to study the planet in more detail. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Using the high-resolution instruments of the James Webb Space Telescope, they confirmed in newly published research that the planet&#39;s atmosphere contains methane and carbon dioxide. At the same time, they also found a weak signal in the spectrum of K2-18&amp;nbsp;b. Analysis showed that this signal may be generated by a molecule called dimethyl sulphide (DMS). On Earth, we currently know that dimethyl sulfide can only be produced by life activities. Most of the dimethyl sulfide in the Earth&#39;s atmosphere is released by marine phytoplankton, which indicates that it may also exist on K2-18&amp;nbsp;b similar life activities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Our findings highlight the diverse considerations that need to be taken into account in the search for life elsewhere,” said Nikku Madhusudhan, an astronomer at the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom and lead author of the paper. The importance of habitable environments. The search for life on exoplanets has traditionally focused on smaller, rocky planets, but larger hydrogen-marine planets are clearly more amenable to atmospheric observations.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, , astronomers still need further observations to confirm the existence of dimethyl sulfide. Madhusudhan said that subsequent observations by the James Webb Telescope will confirm whether dimethyl sulfide is indeed present in the atmosphere of K2-18&amp;nbsp;b. This research team believes that K2-18&amp;nbsp;b and other hydrogen sea planets may be excellent places for us to discover life outside the solar system. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The James Webb Space Telescope has been in use for more than a year, demonstrating its powerful observation capabilities and constantly surprising astronomers. As more and more powerful space telescopes and ground-based telescopes are put into use, constructed or put on the development schedule, astronomers will gain increasingly powerful capabilities to observe exoplanets. Maybe discovering extraterrestrial life on Earth is just a fantasy, but if extraterrestrial life really exists, we will be able to detect signs of their activities on an exoplanet in the near future. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/03/LdhG4qqa7a7vUhM2yf5FXKKIbvDGmUxPyUFpWymE.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;635&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/03/LdhG4qqa7a7vUhM2yf5FXKKIbvDGmUxPyUFpWymE.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252973&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Remains on display during a hearing in the Mexican Congress. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Reuters/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/ 23/10/03/2mapv6MsFjVZXXjxxbF70wRaXgQj9T8abzGIy1tm.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;2560&quot; height=&quot;1094&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/03/ 2mapv6MsFjVZXXjxxbF70wRaXgQj9T8abzGIy1tm.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252972&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Member of NASA&#39;s Unidentified Anomaly Research Team. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（NASA/Picture）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23 /10/03/thCtXyW4lh5rn7bzhiFcHXpwr6JJ30BM9cjSnprR.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;540&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/03/thCtXyW4lh5rn7bzhiFcHXpwr6JJ30 BM9cjSnprR .jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252971&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Artistic imagination of the exoplanet K2-18 b orbiting the cold dwarf star K2-18 picture. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(NASA/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 04 Oct 2023 17:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[南阳迷笛音乐节营地大量失窃上热搜：全力破案方能挽回声誉丨快评]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258070]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-04 15:28:30&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Halfway through the long holiday, the Midi Music Festival held in Nanyang, Henan suddenly appeared on the social media hot search list, not because How well done, but because - &quot;stealing things&quot;. For this city that was once famous for Zhuge Wolong, if the case cannot be solved as soon as possible, not only may the next Midi Music Festival be ruined, but it will also affect the reputation of the entire city. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 3, the keywords &quot;Midi steals things&quot; quickly became hot topics on social media. According to information released by netizens at the scene, the music festival had ended the day before, and many music fans who participated in the music festival had not yet evacuated. However, a large number of nearby villagers went into the campground to search for things. According to Solitaire’s stolen property statistics, some people’s clothing and shoes were stolen, some wine and tea were stolen, some camping equipment such as tents, sleeping bags, and moisture-proof mats were lost, and high-value electronic and digital products such as computers, mobile phones, cameras, and recording equipment were stolen. Some &quot;thiefs&quot; only took away the tent, leaving other materials neatly in place. Even the fist-thick cables on the stage were stolen. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to self-reported information by the thieves, the total value of the stolen materials may reach hundreds of thousands of yuan. A video circulating on the Internet shows a middle-aged woman who was caught taking something out of her bag while defending herself: &quot;We just went to get it when no one was there,&quot; as if the owner of the tent had temporarily left ( Maybe you go out to eat or even just use the toilet), the things in the tent become ownerless and can be taken as you please. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As the first original music festival in China, the Midi Music Festival with a history of more than 20 years has become one of the most famous carnivals in the Chinese music industry, especially rock music. For the venue where the music festival is held, tens of thousands of enthusiastic music fans from all over the country will not only bring direct income to the local area, but also become an excellent opportunity to promote the local area. Therefore, many cities, especially third- and fourth-tier cities, are competing to hold or invite large-scale music festivals to be held locally. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This Midi Music Festival was held in Nanyang and also received great attention from the local area. According to the official social media account &quot;Nanyang Release&quot; of the Nanyang Municipal Government Information Office, on September 29, the opening day of the Central Plains Midi Music Festival, the Secretary of the Nanyang Municipal Party Committee and the Mayor, wearing red volunteer uniforms, personally greeted the guests at the exit of Nanyang Railway Station. Music fans all over the country. Half a month ago, Nanyang City held a preparatory meeting for the Midi Music Festival. The Secretary of the Municipal Party Committee personally made arrangements and required the establishment of a high-standard headquarters at the municipal level to carefully carry out various guarantee work for the music festival. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A few days before the opening of the music festival, the Nanyang Municipal Government Information Office also released a city image promotional video and a local &quot;food, drink, and fun picture&quot; through its official account to promote local tourism resources. Such high-standard preparation and reception highlight the importance attached to the music festival. It was with this kind of attention that the music festival itself seemed to go without any problems. However, what was unexpected was that large-scale thefts occurred after the festival. It can be said that the previous efforts were ruined. This makes the previous official statement of “protecting the personal and property safety of tourists” a joke. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to theft, netizens who attended the music festival accused some people of harassing tourists in the name of toasting during dinner in the hotel, and even beating tourists while drunk. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This information spreads rapidly through social networks. If the local area fails to take prompt measures to identify problems such as theft and harassment, it will greatly damage the image of the local area. In addition to the stolen music fans who said that if there is no result in handling this incident, they will never visit Nanyang again. Some netizens also said that they felt very unsafe after watching the video of the villagers taking things away, and they will definitely do so when traveling in the future. Avoid this place. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the descriptions of the thieves and live music fans, most of the thieves were local villagers, who even used tricycles to pull the items. This scene can&#39;t help but remind people of the situations that have happened in many places before where villagers stole the crops of foreign agricultural entrepreneurs. It was reported in the summer of 2019 that a sweet potato farmer in Henan contracted 200 acres of land to grow watermelons. When the watermelons matured, nearby villagers gathered in groups to steal the melons. A melon-picking incident also occurred in Jiaxing, Zhejiang, where almost all the watermelons from more than 20 greenhouses were stolen. Some melon thieves were even caught by melon farmers and fell to the ground and were &quot;injured&quot; during the pulling process. Instead, the melon farmers were asked to pay compensation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In these theft incidents, some places often use various excuses to excuse local farmers. For example, it is not &quot;theft&quot;, but they believe the rumor that &quot;the owner doesn&#39;t want it anymore&quot;, or there are people in the local area who are not the owners. The tradition of “picking up the leaks” after harvesting, etc. In the Midi Music Festival theft incident, some participants alleged that after catching the thief and calling the police, the police let the villagers go because &quot;there was no evidence to prove the theft.&quot; If the property of participants cannot be protected for a large-scale event that the government attaches so much importance to, who will dare to come here in the future? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is true that the quality of villagers in some places is not high, they are greedy for petty gains, and their legal awareness is weak. They have the idea that the law does not punish the public, and they feel that taking some things from &quot;outsiders&quot; will not do anything. If local officials do not take severe measures to punish these thieving villagers and cannot effectively protect the interests of foreign tourists or investors, and their reputation is ruined, no one will dare to travel or invest here again. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the announcement from the Midi Music Festival Organizing Committee, the local police have set up a task force to investigate the theft cases. Some fans also reported that some of the stolen items had been recovered. This time Nanyang must make every effort to solve the case, recover the stolen goods, reduce the losses of music fans, and at the same time severely punish the thieves without mercy. Only in this way can it be possible to restore the reputation, restore the music festival, restore the music fans, and restore the tourists from all over the country. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 04 Oct 2023 15:55:04 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
