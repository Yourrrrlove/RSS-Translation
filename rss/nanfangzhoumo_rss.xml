He was referring to the interview with Southern People Weekly in 2019, when he had just graduated from the Central Academy of Drama. In the past few years, his acting career had become more mature. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhang Xincheng has appeared in more types of film and television works and discovered more diverse artistic skills, including participating in reality shows, releasing music albums, and expressing his thoughts more freely in interviews, showing a more relaxed attitude. On the one hand, &quot;I used to think this was not good, that was not good, but now I feel more confident.&quot; But he still habitually looks at himself and cares about his external presentation, just like when he was watching a movie on set Playback in the viewfinder, scrolling through audience comments on social media. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The radar of self-examination is always on. Zhang Xincheng will often make corrections or additions to a sentence after finishing it. &quot;When making a movie, you will feel that you are dedicating yourself to art. ... The art here is a false proposition. It is not art in a broad sense, but the art you think you are. When you dedicate yourself to it, you will feel very ritualistic. &quot;Every time the team we work with work hard, everyone is immersed in it, there are no bystanders. Of course, there will be a creator trap for insiders, and they may go to the other extreme, but the process is wonderful.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Family education and schooling experience have shaped Zhang Xincheng’s serious and rigorous character. In middle school, he was taught to be a top student. &quot;My mother always told me not to do anything inappropriate, so I stuck to the rules most of the time.&quot; After entering the Chinese Opera, he was taught to be a good actor. He will use an academic attitude to talk about performance, how to speak lines accurately and naturally, and how to design habitual actions to distinguish characters. His rationality and prudence even allow him to design the flaws of characters, because perfect people do not exist. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But Zhang Xincheng feels that he is not a very self-motivated person in nature. He is lazy and procrastinates. He is also not a person who uses rationality to choose the optimal solution. He is more willing to follow his inner thoughts of escape. After working, like all young people who are just beginning to try to be independent, he slowly freed himself from the shackles of previous disciplines and &quot;opened up&quot; himself through the profession of actor. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhang Xincheng, who views himself &quot;rationally&quot;, is more &quot;emotional&quot; in his choice of scripts. He still tends to choose tragic characters that he is more interested in, such as Cheng Yizhi in &quot;The Light&quot;, who is born like Weed, who has been tortured, has seen all the darkness and filth in the world; Pei Zhi in &quot;The Basics of Genius&quot; has been making a choice between sacrificing for his family and pursuing himself. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhang Xincheng has gained an ancient Greek tragic aesthetic in these characters, &quot;Life itself is dull, but the life in the drama has ups and downs. There may be a car accident, and the life will be broken; there may be a meeting To the death of loved ones. But pain is directly proportional to happiness. During the filming process, the more pain and torture I experienced, the more happiness I felt in retrospect.&quot; In the unusual tragic experience, the perceptual switch was turned on. Open it, &quot;I can feel the emotions of the world more and start to receive signals.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Equal time&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;It&#39;s like building blocks high and then knocking them all down again. From learning to be a Since he was an actor, Zhang Xincheng has been training himself to shape characters, designing and reviewing at the same time. When filming &quot;Basic Method of Genius&quot;, he felt that these external formal things were &quot;finished&quot; and no longer needed to be done deliberately. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“I suddenly noticed that when I say a line, I don’t just say it to rhythm and handle it well, but to put this sentence into the opponent’s heart. Every expression and line I make, It is stimulating the opponent. All the designs are not important. When you feel the emotion in your heart, you will naturally express it.&quot; When filming &quot;Dark Fire&quot;, Zhang Xincheng acted in Mandarin with dialect color, and he no longer thought about how to act. He spoke his lines but didn&#39;t say a single word wrong. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The process of building, tearing down and rebuilding was not peaceful and was accompanied by long periods of anxiety. Zhang Xincheng&#39;s debut went smoothly. He started taking roles while he was in school, and one crew followed another. But he felt that he did not have a particularly distinctive trait that made people remember him, and he could not find one for himself. &quot;It seems difficult for me to do it.&quot; When participating in a reality show, he should have found a way to highlight himself, but he was still used to it. hide behind; follow your heart when choosing a script. When the results are not satisfactory, you will inevitably fall into self-doubt, &quot;Am I not capable enough?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Until this year, Zhang Xincheng was able to say it calmly. , &quot;I can&#39;t do this&quot;, and can accept all choices calmly, &quot;I want to understand, time is equal, you didn&#39;t do that thing in those four months, but you did other things, you got It’s like opening a box, you can only choose one box, and you can’t see the contents of other boxes. You lose the other boxes, but you get this one.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; After the sense of gain and loss and utilitarianism became less strong, looking back on the past, he finally changed his self-evaluation passing score to 90 points. &quot;If life is lived for a result, it seems that time will become shorter. If the process is unfolded, , it seems that a lot of things have happened, just have fun in the process.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhang Xincheng knows what the pinnacle of his career is: to become a highly reputable actor, not just for his excellent acting skills. , has commercial value, is respected by others, and is unique. He also missed the beginning of his career. At an age when he didn’t know what filming was, he had endless energy every day. After filming, he would play with the crew and take photos with costumes, props, and scene management. “I don’t think so. I was stupid at that time, and I thought it was quite valuable. It took a long time to receive education and change the habits of childhood, but it would be very difficult to finally return to the freedom of childhood.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;True The Paradox&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 凯体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;What adjectives would you use to describe yourself? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Zhang Xincheng: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Lazy, out-of-the-box thinking, and optimistic. I used to think that I was pessimistic, because I often saw things in a bad light, but I found that there might be a layer of optimism underneath the pessimism. After thinking about it, I still felt that things would definitely get better, and I still believed in some hope. Although I prefer tragedies, it is precisely because I have a relatively optimistic core that I like tragedies and dare to watch them. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;What do you think is your most distinctive trait? , a trait that comes to mind when everyone mentions it, or do you think you have such a trait? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Zhang Xincheng: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I don’t think I have such a trait. Everyone knows that I usually play the roles I have played, but actually I don’t know either. What are your own personal characteristics. In this short video era, people are always required to have a very obvious label. But I feel like I&#39;m not that kind of person. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;When you participate in a reality show, you will give Do you want to find a characteristic that you want to show to everyone? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Zhang Xincheng: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;No, I participated in the variety show just to rest, not to highlight myself. I don’t speak much in it, and I don’t lead opinions. Everyone says you have to do this or that, stand out and let everyone remember you. I think that will put a lot of pressure on me. I am not a person who talks a lot at any time, so I don’t force myself to talk deliberately. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;What do you think you are in the reality show? The real you? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Zhang Xincheng: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Reality shows have a very real part. Not everything is deliberately created, but people have many shortcomings. In real people, When I show off, I try my best to cover up these shortcomings and try my best to be the best version of myself. I feel that this is not the real me. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is different when you are acting, because you are not yourself, so you are very free. When we were children, we played a game called &quot;Grand Theft Auto&quot; in which we raced and shot. In reality, no one would do this because they are bound by morality, but in the game there is no such thing. It does not mean that everyone desires to do sinful things. It just means you are freest when you are not yourself. The role is played by you, and you do his things, but people don’t think you are him. You are not “you”, but you are “you”. Instead, reality shows must become a better “you”. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You often share your life on social media, what do you like to shoot? What kind of photos? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Zhang Xincheng:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;According to my previous personality, I didn’t like to record. Why should we record? Can’t we just move forward? Now I will stop and take a few photos without knowing what I am taking, as if it is stored in the camera forever. I especially don&#39;t like to delete any record. So much memory is just for a certain moment in life, and I suddenly want to see it. I don&#39;t want this to get lost. It felt like I had seized the moment. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I like to take black and white photos, high-contrast black and white, followed by photos with rich tones. It is a flaw that does not restore reality very well, but it is also a kind of beauty and has a sense of story. The sense of story is what attracts me, because there are so many good-looking things that make people dazzled and even attracted. But a photo with a story is rare in daily life and is relatively precious. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.run&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. run&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 26 Nov 2023 15:25:05 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[守护“千年鸟道”]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261251]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-26 14:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 11/22/eOvutWJW8Nobv2bGQ5Xv1RJqvRtwZxeiKuL383km.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;669&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/22/eOvutWJW8Nobv2bGQ5Xv1RJqvRtw ZxeiKuL383km. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;259229&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On October 26, 2023, Congjiang Town, Guidong County, Hunan Province and Jiangxi Province At the Nanfengao Migratory Bird Protection Station at the junction of Yingpanwei Township, Suichuan County, bird rangers from the two provinces and two counties conduct joint bird protection inspections in the mountains &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Guo Liliang/Photo)&lt;/ span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Billions of migratory birds migrate across continents every year, and 3 of the 8 migration routes pass through China. In autumn, flocks of migratory birds take off from Siberia, the grasslands of Inner Mongolia, the North China Plain and other places, and fly to southern China via the east, middle and west routes to spend the winter.

Recently, some new energy vehicle owners have reported that charging fees at public charging piles have increased since the second half of the year. Does this situation exist? With this question in mind, reporters conducted investigations in many places. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Drivers of operating vehicles are more sensitive to changes in charging fees for new energy vehicles. Master Wei is an online ride-hailing driver in Zhengzhou, Henan, because he goes to public charging stations to charge once or twice a day. His mobile phone clearly records the cost of each charge. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/26/8707fe1a673b3f7a07d093f566fc40ca.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1176&quot; height= &quot;661&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/26/8707fe1a673b3f7a07d093f566fc40ca.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;259659&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Henan Zhengzhou Net Ride-hailing driver Wei Zhenhua: My charging fee has obviously increased. It used to be 1,200 yuan a month, but now it is as high as 1,500 yuan. It has indeed increased a lot. Especially after August, it rose by about 20 to 30%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The charging fee at public charging piles consists of two parts: electricity price and service fee. Electricity prices have been mainly formed by the market, with &quot;level in and level out&quot; and charging pile operators are not allowed to increase prices. Prices vary in different seasons and during peak, wave, and flat periods every day. The service fee is determined by each charging pile operating company based on market conditions. During the interview, the reporter found that charging fees at public piles have increased not only in Zhengzhou but also in many cities in Henan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/26/06b4189b0c487b25cc2eed44e60cad19.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1176&quot; height= &quot;662&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/26/06b4189b0c487b25cc2eed44e60cad19.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;259661&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A new energy Co., Ltd. Henan regional director Yu Haitao: We charging companies have raised the service fee for primary charging. It has been raised by about 1 jiao to 1 jiao and 2 cents compared to the beginning of the year. So overall, everyone feels the increase in charging prices. The amplitude is relatively large. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Surveys show that the service fees of some charging companies have even increased by about 50%. So, why do they want to adjust the price? Some charging pile operating companies told reporters that the high cost of early investment in charging pile construction and the long-term strategy of &quot;grabbing the market&quot; for low-price operations have put them under greater operating pressure. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/26/97ea8d2c1b65c4cf380c9c6814e67c0b.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1176&quot; height= &quot;661&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/26/97ea8d2c1b65c4cf380c9c6814e67c0b.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;259657&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;An electronics company in Henan Wei Hongyu, Operations Director of Technology Co., Ltd.: The main reason for this increase is that as our operations deepen, we find that there is even a risk of inversion in the service fee income of charging stations compared to our station construction costs and our operating costs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Financial reports of some charging operation companies show that although the company&#39;s operating income is rising every year, it is negative profits every year. At the same time, in order to attract more users, operators tend to build high-power charging piles. However, the basic cost of high-power charging piles is relatively high. Some also need to build additional corresponding distribution boxes, and maintenance costs will naturally increase. . Therefore, raising service fees has become the current solution to recover costs. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The cost of using new energy vehicles still has a greater advantage than that of gasoline vehicles&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Through interviews and surveys, the reporter found that in some cities, the rising charging costs of electric vehicles do exist. So this situation Does it happen in all cities across the country? Are the cost advantages of buying an electric car still there? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During interviews and surveys in many places, reporters found that the rise in charging costs for new energy vehicles only occurred in some cities, and charging costs in most cities across the country fell into a stable range. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/26/51786d4413d5411912229c0755b9dc9e.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1176&quot; height= &quot;661&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/26/51786d4413d5411912229c0755b9dc9e.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;259658&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Beijing New Energy Car owner: There is not much increase. I have charged at several nearby charging stations. There is not much change. It is basically the same as before. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Shenzhen new energy vehicle owners: The electricity price at this time is 1.27 yuan per unit. The overall cost is not particularly high and it is quite affordable. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Data from the China Electric Vehicle Charging Infrastructure Promotion Alliance show that from January to October this year, the number of public charging piles in my country was 728,000, and the number in October was 63,000, a year-on-year increase of 50.3%. The increase in the number of charging piles not only meets the rapid development of new energy vehicles, but also makes competition among charging pile operating companies more intense. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/26/b7fa96dfbaeb011d9617520d6d2e690a.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1176&quot; height= &quot;661&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/26/b7fa96dfbaeb011d9617520d6d2e690a.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;259662&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A smart phone in Beijing Chen Dong, the person in charge of Technology Co., Ltd.: The overall charging price is still relatively low now, because the competition in the industry is fierce. We have more than 40 charging stations in Beijing. Winter is the peak charging season, and the overall cost has not been adjusted upwards. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Experts said that fluctuations in charging fees in most cities are the result of market supply and demand adjustments, and the quality of increases or decreases cannot be judged absolutely. Most cities have now abolished the maximum price limit on service fees, and each operator can determine the level of charging service fees based on market competition. At the same time, in the face of the issue raised by some netizens that the cost of using new energy vehicles is almost equal to that of gasoline vehicles, experts also gave reporters a calculation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/26/4bc772773657773a07d7dfe0eb594a4d.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1176&quot; height= &quot;661&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/26/4bc772773657773a07d7dfe0eb594a4d.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;259660&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;China Electric Power Corporation Liu Yongdong, deputy secretary-general of the federation: For example, for every 100 kilometers of our oil truck, the industry requires about 10 liters of oil. We estimate that it will be calculated at about 8 yuan, which is 80 yuan. Let&#39;s look at the tram again. On average, it requires about 15 kilowatt hours of electricity per 100 kilometers. The overall consumption of each kilowatt hour of electricity plus service fees is about 1.5 yuan. So the entire 15 kilowatt hours of electricity is about 22.5 yuan. Even if it is 25 yuan, we Comparing 25 yuan with 80 yuan, it should be said that there is still a huge gap. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>; Various regions have launched new measures to shape the healthy development of new energy vehicles&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; In order to ensure a good charging experience for new energy vehicle owners, various regions have successively introduced new policies such as time-of-use electricity prices for charging facilities. The implementation of relevant measures will not only guide car owners to use electricity rationally, but will also be more conducive to the healthy and sustainable development of the new energy vehicle industry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In September this year, Shandong began to implement a new time-of-use electricity price policy for residents&#39; charging, which subdivided the peak and valley periods and added deep valley and peak periods. During the deep valley period, the electricity price was 0.222 yuan per kilowatt hour, which is the same as The price difference during peak hours is 0.666 yuan per kilowatt hour. By widening the price difference, users are guided to avoid charging during peak hours. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/26/97416b76a8b4710da6eed33e4ef12df7.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1176&quot; height= &quot;661&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/26/97416b76a8b4710da6eed33e4ef12df7.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;259663&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Jimo District, Qingdao New energy vehicle owners: Now the electricity price in Shengu for charging at noon is only more than 2 cents per degree. If you go home and have a meal, the electricity will be fully charged. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Not only Shandong, but also Guangdong, Jiangxi, Hunan, Shaanxi and other places have successively introduced time-of-use electricity price policies for residents’ electric vehicle charging facilities. During peak and peak hours, charging car owners need to bear more costs, and During off-peak periods, car owners can enjoy lower prices than before. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/26/ac2c310d54f1abcd7b404c830cf87215.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1176&quot; height= &quot;661&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/26/ac2c310d54f1abcd7b404c830cf87215.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;259667&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Shenzhen New Energy Car owner: It is the peak period for charging now. The current price is 1.49 degrees. We usually choose to charge at noon or at night, and the price will be more favorable. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to the continued efforts of government policies, some charging operating companies are also actively exploring new trends in future development. On the one hand, it is necessary to add new momentum to corporate operations, and on the other hand, the charging experience of car owners must also be considered. In order to &quot;stand out&quot; in the market competition, they choose to provide more comprehensive services. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/26/97bd9ffcf65eb191c4e283ced6f959ab.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1176&quot; height= &quot;661&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/26/97bd9ffcf65eb191c4e283ced6f959ab.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;259665&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A new person in Shenzhen Chen Huanyu, operations director of the energy company: Our service fee is only about a little more than a triangle, which is 5% higher than the service fee of surrounding operators. Our advantage is that the supporting facilities are relatively complete, which solves the driver&#39;s dining problem. To solve the problem of rest, we also have a comprehensive service area with quick car repairs, quick washes, and a comprehensive online car-hailing service platform. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, charging operation companies have also strengthened the level of interconnection and interoperability. In Hainan, the reporter saw that the supervision and operation service platform linked different operators together. There are 165 charging and swapping operators, 63 public battery swapping stations, and 3,358 charging stations connected here. The access rate of the province&#39;s public charging pile platform reaches 100%. The construction of the platform not only unifies the payment methods, making it more convenient for car owners to &quot;find charging stations&quot;, but also facilitates the monitoring of charging fee fluctuations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/26/d3189767590c844c999708027249926b.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1176&quot; height= &quot;661&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/26/d3189767590c844c999708027249926b.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;259664&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hainan Province Charge Wang Jin, Operations Director of Battery Exchange Network Service Co., Ltd.: Realize the interconnection of pile networks and power grids, promptly report charging stations with irregular charging pricing to pile companies for rectification, and report to the local government management department. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Experts said that both the time-of-use electricity price policy and the active attempts and interconnection measures of charging companies are releasing positive signals and exploring new opportunities for the development of the entire new energy vehicle charging industry. path of. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/26/be2c6bc8f9950f6ebf24436e7242ca9d.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1176&quot; height= &quot;661&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/26/be2c6bc8f9950f6ebf24436e7242ca9d.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;259666&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;China Electric Power Corporation Liu Yongdong, deputy secretary-general of the Federation: Our country is unswervingly committed to developing new energy vehicles.

Over the past ten years, she has gradually been dubbed a science popularization expert because of her tireless science popularization and vivid and humorous narration. title. In the past two years, she has won important honors such as Top Ten Science Communication Figures in China, Chief Science Communication Expert, and Female Science Popularization Expert. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the day of the interview, she spared a few hours, ate a sandwich at noon, and rushed home to prepare for the live broadcast at 4 p.m. Not long ago, she went to attend classes at universities and party schools. The topic she taught was the core of leadership from the perspective of biological evolution, from natural science to humanities and then to philosophy (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 毷体, 毷体_GB2312, STKaiti; &quot;>;This is her usual style&lt;/span>;), recalling her hearty smile and said, &quot;There was no urine in the whole process&quot;; then she was also invited to participate in a TED speech, the theme was &quot;If your major is a transfer, you What will happen next in life?” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Experienced the transition from engineering to science (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Undergraduate survey technology and engineering, postgraduate geological engineering, doctoral geology&lt;/p>; span>;), Tang Limei decided to switch his research field to marine geology after listening to a lecture by chance while studying for his PhD. He realized early on that life has no limits and is full of unexpected and unplanned nodes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;With ten years of accumulation in science popularization, she will bring a new book &quot;Exploring the Deep Sea with the &quot;Dragon&quot;&quot; at the end of 2023 to show people a new face of a science popularization writer. The book will introduce the basic knowledge of the ocean (&lt;span style= &quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;For example, what is the sea, what is the ocean, how to form&lt;/span>;), the five major oceans of the world (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_ GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Newly included in the Southern Ocean in 2021&lt;/span>;)&#39;s cutting-edge knowledge, personal experience in deep-sea exploration, and the development history of the country&#39;s manned deep submersibles, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It took less than half a year to write the book. She was busier than before. She didn&#39;t even have time to wash her face after getting up every morning. She said that her days now consist of only three things: work, exercise, and reading and thinking. She has been able to maintain her body shape for nearly 20 years after getting up early for a run. During the interview, she was wearing the team uniform she wore during the Antarctic scientific expedition in 2017, and it still fit her perfectly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Other than that, there are very few pastimes, and I hardly watch movies. Everything I do must &quot;generate value and meaning.&quot; She would refuse without hesitation if asked to travel to the beach. Only when it became a matter of spending time with her children and family would she be willing to do so. &quot;I can&#39;t go out to play by myself, but I&#39;m willing to do it with others. It&#39;s valuable.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She recalled more than ten years ago when life was not so full. , I still have plenty of time to watch &quot;The Legend of Zhen Huan&quot;, and during the period when I went to the Pacific to &quot;isolate&quot;, I watched it intermittently nearly 20 times in total. &quot;It wouldn&#39;t be so busy then. I would definitely choose to read a book now.&quot; It wasn&#39;t until 2022 that she turned the content of the TV series into a class, and then she finally let go of the time wasted. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/22/GDFKKq1U2uGe4wXxCkfhZo5gEfOBJvo01JL7UOFU.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;540&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/22/GDFKKq1U2uGe4wXxCkfhZo5gEfOBJvo01JL7UOFU.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;259210&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Ocean Open Class&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(video screenshot/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The lecture content revolves around &quot;Zhen Huan&quot; &quot;Scientific trivia in the Biography&quot;, &quot;For example, there is an episode where the emperor went to An Lingrong&#39;s place to celebrate her birthday. He was very tired of eating, so he happened to get him some light pastries. Why do we eat dessert after a meal? It&#39;s because we The perception of sweetness is at the tip of the tongue, and the perception of bitterness is at the back of the tongue, and then there are other areas in the middle, such as spicy food. Therefore, we can still eat something sweet after a meal because we can feel sweetness at the tip of the tongue at the earliest. .&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;There is also braised pork, which is the Maillard reaction. Isn&#39;t the Maillard color popular this year? Maillard is actually caramel color, which is what it turns into after the sugar is burned. Color, what happens between it and braised pork is the Maillard reaction. Why do we need to add sugar? When you make braised pork, you can educate your children about science. These knowledge points are closely related to life; and why do we have oleander powder? Poisonous? I explained its formula, and then what is the most poisonous part of it? Tree trunks, leaves and flowers are all poisonous. Finally, why are these women fighting in the play? These are the backward ideas of feudal society. Let’s talk about it finally. The awakening of women in our new era includes humanistic methods.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She believes that subject segmentation is actually unscientific because &quot;all knowledge is interlinked&quot; and is often lacking in the dissemination of knowledge. Not even one. She likes the title of &quot;Science Communication Figure&quot;, &quot;It&#39;s quite appropriate. Just like preaching, science is also a cognitive system.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She looks at everything around her with a comprehensive view of the universe and cherishes it. Curious, &quot;Actually, everything is learning. You may have thought it was entertainment before, but with a learning mentality, if you really understand the background, culture or meaning of TV series, movies and other cultural works, it is actually learning.&quot;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;In her spare time during the Antarctic scientific expedition, Tang Limei also watched a few sporadic movies, including the literary film &quot;Sunset Trilogy&quot; series, which she also watched repeatedly. What attracts her is not the romantic encounter between the male and female protagonists, but the social topics that the two communicate and discuss from sunset to sunrise. &quot;In fact, the most attractive thing about it is its topic. It is not that two people are in love, they discuss They are all the destruction of society by developed countries, the infringement of weak countries, the garbage we produce now, the underlying logic of society, etc.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She has also watched some of &quot;Celebrating More Than Years&quot; and she likes it. With time-travel elements, I am also planning to write some science fiction novels next, &quot;For example, two fishes (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 毷体, 毷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;because we humans evolved from fish (&lt;/span>;), a story of pure love that has gone through five mass extinctions, nine evolutions, and then traveled through several lives. In this long evolution, &quot;The Three-Body Problem&quot; is set in the universe. It may be based on the hundreds of millions of years of biological evolution.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Now that she is in the conceptual stage, she is already very excited. &quot;It should be particularly enjoyable if I write it later. In fact, this is a process of creation. The meaning of life lies in creation. Only when you create something you love, will you feel happy and in a flow.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In 2019, she participated in a training session at the Youth League School of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, and later became a member of the Youth Lecturers Group of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League. Since then, she has frequently given lectures in colleges and universities. She noticed that the new generation of young people are increasingly concerned about spiritual values. &quot;Public welfare must be the trend in the future. There will definitely be more and more people engaged in charity and volunteer services among the post-2000 generation, because it may be difficult for them to make a rapid economic leap from their work, so they will look for other ways. To realize your own value, engage more in charity and manual work, that is, to help others and feel happiness from the process of serving others.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;There will be more and more of these industries, like my daughter, What can you say to make her feel happy? It’s not that her mother went to her school and gave a speech. Everyone regarded me as an idol and worshiped me. This was a pressure for her; her happiness was similar to that once I took her to a friend&#39;s birthday party, and after she gave the butterfly she made with a twist stick to someone else, she felt sincerely happy because of the other person&#39;s gratitude.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The first book has not yet been released, and it is non-stop. Tang Limei has already begun to imagine her future &quot;writing ambitions&quot;. &quot;If I publish one book every year, I can probably write 20 more in my life. I hope one or two of them will be popular science classics for teenagers.&quot; Through these words again and again. and written words. What she is committed to disseminating is not only scientific knowledge, but also &quot;the meaning of life.&quot; She hopes that her slightly tortuous but persevering experience can inspire young people and make those young faces in the audience understand, &quot;Everyone should have their own way out and live well.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https ://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.run&quot; style=&quot; color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.run&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 26 Nov 2023 12:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[吴慷仁，给自己拍拍手吧]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261336]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-26 10:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 11/25/ZJCNUHvqqsswjIpk4Tq6AEUJT96BP6xETrXHQmgA.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/25/ZJCNUHvqqsswjIpk4Tq6AEUJT96BP 6xETrXHQmgA. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;259646&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Wu Kangren (Visual China) &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt; /span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Newcomer Wu Kangren&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Wu Kangren is standing in the middle of the lobby of a hotel in Xiamen, dancing and talking with people.

By 2015, he left his agent to work independently. Just before he was about to win his first Golden Bell Award, Wu Kangren suddenly took off his mask. &quot;Wearing a mask is uncomfortable,&quot; he said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When someone looked at him, he looked back with a smile; when someone patted him, he waved his hand from a distance; when someone stared at him, he slowly changed his position to avoid it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“When I didn’t care much about what other people thought of me, I felt a lot less burdened.” Wu Kangren said, “I began to realize that the identity I originally cared about was just my career and an external label. . I want to get back my identity and my life. What I have to do at the moment is the most important, such as going out to buy things.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past ten years, Wu Kangren has starred in many word-of-mouth movies.

In Xiamen, young people shouted to him: &quot;Gao Jiayue, praise, praise, praise!&quot; &quot;Gao Jiayue is his character in the new drama &quot;Lifetime&quot;, and his catchphrase is &quot;Zan Zan Zan&quot;.

It has won awards at many international film festivals. Wu Kangren won this year&#39;s First Youth Award Best Actor at the Film Festival.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He received the First trophy in Xiamen, took a group photo, and then held it halfway. He was also the Best Actor in this year&#39;s First Film Festival media selection. When he heard that there were also trophies for the venue selection, he shook with joy.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He cherishes every recognition he gets, whether it is an award or the favor of his seniors. This is why he often plays guest roles. : To repay a favor. He made a cameo appearance as a pervert who sexually harassed a female subordinate in the TV series &quot;Her and Her Her&quot;, but he couldn&#39;t find an actor for this disgusting role. Out of gratitude for the producer of the show who had taken care of him in the past, Wu Kangren took over the role. The original male lead of &quot;Copycat&quot; missed the appointment due to schedule, and the crew was at a standstill. They were in urgent need of a replacement who could be accepted by Netflix. It was Wu Kangren again. In order not to affect the follow-up film appointments, he rushed to work for 16 days in a row. He only sleeps two or three hours a day.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He thanked Chen Huiling, the director of &quot;Next Stop, Happiness&quot; many times. &quot;(To the director) jokingly said that there was no opportunity to perform in &quot;Next Stop&quot; at that time, maybe now I was still serving plates in restaurants and stuff like that, but I actually meant it. &quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2009, Wu Kangren starred in the idol drama &quot;Next Stop, Happiness&quot; as Hua Takuya, the second male lead who silently protected the heroine for many years and finally let go. He created a chapter in the history of Taiwanese idol dramas Classic: With tears in his eyes, he suppressed the sadness rushing out of his chest, and said to the heroine with a smile: &quot;Why, I was the one who met you first, but you still chose to lead him six years ago and six years later. hand. ”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/25/UfGy4Qfh5w7K2VHjG4Qa5ctSc3ksZ3zcvRcMN3h6.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;680&quot; height =&quot;1024&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/25/UfGy4Qfh5w7K2VHjG4Qa5ctSc3ksZ3zcvRcMN3h6.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;259648&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot; color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Next Stop, Happiness (2009) &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I watched it for the first time He was surprised when he was acting, how could someone crying be so touching. I asked director Chen Huiling, and the director said it was because he was acting with his life. &quot;said screenwriter Lu Shiyuan. Wu Kangren later became the leading actor in her works &quot;The Exit Office&quot; and &quot;The Distance Between Us and Evil&quot;. Both of these dramas brought Wu Kangren nominations for Best Actor at the Golden Bell Awards.&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;In this way, Wu Kangren, who had just quit his job as a bartender, emerged with &quot;Hua Tuoye&quot;.

A way to make money for a living. &quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, &quot;Next Stop, Happiness&quot; was the last peak of Taiwanese idol dramas. Since then, Taiwanese dramas, which have been popular in Asia for ten years, have been declining. What is mutually responsible for the decline of Taiwanese dramas is that mainland TV dramas and Korean dramas gradually occupied Taiwanese TV stations, and Taiwanese dramas that lost their audience also lost the funds of the TV stations. It was also at that time that the backbone of Taiwanese dramas and future stars, such as Ethan Ruan, Zhao Youting, Chen Bolin, Ariel Ariel, Chen Qiaoen, etc., all turned to the mainland Development.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Newcomer Wu Kangren stayed in Taiwan and worked hard to act in his own way.&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Like a foreign worker&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Starring &quot;Fudu Youth&quot; was won by Wu Kangren.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What he saw was the synopsis of the venture capital period.

One day he was staring at his cat and suddenly felt that filming in Taiwan was out of his comfort zone, and he wanted to change places. He thought of &quot;Fudu Youth&quot;, so he called the director and asked if you were still filming and if you didn&#39;t plan to find me.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;The director also told me honestly: they do have other candidates. . But I feel that I am very sincere and can go to Malaysia a month earlier and the (remuneration) can be cheaper. &quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For Wu Kangren, &quot;Fudu Youth&quot; is a rare opportunity. Nowadays, professional dramas are popular in Taiwan. He has portrayed etiquette masters, lawyers, prosecutors, etc. He has also tried many unconventional characters, For example, mamasang, habitual thieves who steal women&#39;s underwear, etc. This is how he trains himself.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 11/25/oFjvo5nnR54pP2w1ScDw66JDokygZzTeBkAo528W.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/25/oFjvo5nnR54pP2w1ScDw66JDokygZzTe BkAo528W. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;259639&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Fudu Youth (2023) &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>; &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Fudu Youth&quot; is different. The people in the film have no career difficulties. They seem unconventional and marginal, but they actually exist in Malaysia. It tells the story of a pair of undocumented foreign workers. The brothers are living an ignoble existence in an old community in Fudu where foreign workers gather. The elder brother Abang (played by Wu Kangren) was born mute, and he works hard and accepts his fate. The younger brother Adi (played by Chen Zeyao) is unwilling to bow to fate. He only wants to make money and takes his brother with him. Leave this disgusting place.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Lilin is the producer of the movies &quot;Decibel Life&quot; and &quot;Lost Andy&quot;. When he was filming for &quot;Decibel Life&quot;, he observed that there were many problems in the Pudu community of Kuala Lumpur. Foreign workers, lonely elderly people, transgender people, etc. Three years later, he decided to shoot his first film with some unidentified people as the protagonists in the market of Fudu.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot; Since &quot;Decibel Life&quot;, I have wanted to be close to these people, and I feel very strongly about them. &quot;Wang Lilin said.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This movie, from the director to the leading actors, followed the principle of &quot;really listening, seeing, and feeling.&quot; After Wu Kangren and Chen Zeyao worked in the market and learned sign language for about a month, the movie was released in Filming in Fudu has officially started.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fudu has a smell. The market where you work has the smell of fish, chicken and sweet fruits, and the enclosed building where you live has the smell of food, soap, sweat and Urine.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the film, there is a close-up scene of washing hands. Wu Kangren carefully rubs each fingernail. &quot;This is indeed an action I do every day at the end of the day, because the smell on my hands is so rich. &quot;Wu Kangren said, &quot;When I smoked, I smelled the smell of offal on my fingertips, so I thought, hey, I should wash it again. ”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The script gives branches, but the flesh and blood of the film depends on the actors themselves.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Abang makes a living by killing chickens and moving goods, so Wu Kangren killed chickens that were 20 days old— —Although the director initially did not plan to shoot a scene of killing a chicken. Eggs can be found by poking the butt of a chicken, and foreign workers often eat the eggs raw. They wanted to give them to Wu Kangren several times, and Wu Kangren repeatedly said, &quot;Thank you, thank you, thank you.&quot;&lt; /p>; &lt;p>;Although the raw eggs were not eaten, Wu Kangren brought this detail into the movie: Abang, who came home from work, carried a bag of eggs and shared them with his neighbor and his daughter.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He wanted to let I am truly like a foreign worker in a rich city. Not only can I work, but I have also become black, thin and slovenly. &quot;When I first went there, I was like this now. I weighed more than 70 kilograms in vain.

They collected money and handed over He had no energy to have more interactions with people.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He was killing chickens while approaching Fudu. He smoked, ate, and chatted with the foreign workers, looking at the expired passports they carried with them, and listening to their He talked about having a girlfriend or quarreling with his wife. He observed rats and said that he had never seen rats that looked like they had been trained. They ran past in groups, clanking and clanking, and dispersed like Moses parting the sea when they saw people.

When he first lost weight rapidly for the movie &quot;Termites&quot; (2016), he was a little optimistic, thinking that if his body changed first, he would be able to observe the psychological changes. He was also a little intentional, thinking that this might be able to be used in acting. There are unexpected effects.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before becoming an actor, he sweated and sweated on the construction site and got paid, so he firmly believed that hard work would be rewarded. He washed cups in the kitchen and had to work on the countertop and off stage. Just as clean, this later even became his belief: I, Wu Kangren, show you the same in person as I do in private. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The same goes for getting fatter and thinner. No one knew what to gain by acting like this, but he wanted to know; he&#39;d tried it, so he knew the power of shape-shifting. &quot;I&#39;m quite fortunate to have done this. It helped me a lot.&quot; He said, &quot;This is irreplaceable and is self-cultivation.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Mute&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; h4>; &lt;p>;When &quot;Fudu Youth&quot; was finalized, the crew gave Wu Kangren a cake, and he started crying when he saw the cake. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I can finally eat!&quot; He said that he was so excited that he cried. &quot;I went to eat chicken the day after the filming was completed!&quot; Once again, Wu Kangren solved the difficulty with a joke. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before Abang was executed, the prison arranged for him to meet with the Master for his final confession. In this play, the director gave full play to &quot;listening, watching, and feeling&quot;: Wu Kangren&#39;s script only has the word &quot;accusation&quot; and no lines; the master is a real eminent monk, Master Kaizhao who has been preaching Buddhism to death row prisoners for more than 30 years. , and there is no script. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wu Kangren and the director rehearsed the scene more than thirty times, trying to understand why Abang had such a strong reaction to release himself in such a situation. &quot;We can imagine that he will have a display of strength in the end, but we didn&#39;t understand where the base point of strength is.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/ image/23/11/25/PnousbgA6PNRLpQfUXmEoJ692wqpfd4Yaarsu6IS.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/ 25/PnousbgA6PNRLpQfUXmEoJ692wqpfd4Yaarsu6IS.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;259641&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Fudu Youth (2023) &lt;span style=&quot;color: # aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Due to the long preparation period and the shooting in chronological order, the actors have enough time to integrate into the characters, so when Wu Kangren heard Master Kaizhao say &quot;live well&quot; , suddenly mourning Abang endlessly. &quot;Living well is the most difficult thing for him. What seems simple to us is a luxury for them. So we must start from this sentence.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Abang and Adi cannot rent The house often wakes up from sleep in the middle of the night to avoid inspection; it is impossible to open a bank account, and all the working money is kept in a rusty cookie box; I cannot buy a motorcycle because I cannot get a driver&#39;s license, so I can only take the bus or walk everywhere. Without status, they will always be forced to work as laborers in Fudu. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Abang once encountered love, but it was fleeting; he once thought he could live a stable life with his brother in Fudu, but his fate overturned it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But they also had their happy moments. Abang, Adi and Sister Money, a transgender person, depend on each other - in Malaysia, transgender people have no identity in another sense - they eat together and dance together. Three people hit their heads with eggs at the dinner table, screaming and laughing in pain. This is Wu Kangren&#39;s favorite scene. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I think the most precious thing is the smiles in life. Throughout the play, they rarely smile, and the things that are taken for granted in life are too harsh for them.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the end, Facing Master Kaizhao, Abang complained: I always wonder why I was born, I have no home, I don’t even have parents, I can only watch from a distance. I&#39;m jealous of you. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I want to be like you. But I can&#39;t! Why is this? I want to talk, I want to be loved and liked, but there is nothing. You told me not to give up, to keep living. But I can&#39;t do it at all. I always have to be careful, alert, hiding, running away. It&#39;s not fair, I did something wrong.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;My life is terrible and I want to change my life, but Impossible. I have no future.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These accusations were made in sign language and facial expressions. The expressions on those who carefully observed the surroundings, the echo of the wrist chain hitting the table, and the tears that had been rolling in the eye sockets for a long time but did not fall, all made this silent accusation deafening. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Don&#39;t preach to me, I have no identity.&quot; Abang pointed to the code on his prison uniform. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Master Kaizhao suddenly held Abang’s hand. Abang calmed down, tears fell, and he sobbed out incomprehensible syllables: &quot;I want to die, I want to die, I want...&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He looked around and found that no one could understand. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Abang is mute, which is a fateful coupling. &quot;A group of people without identity are just like the mute. Even if they speak out, there will be no change.&quot; Wu Kangren said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When Chen Zeyao, who played the younger brother, later saw this silent accusation on the screen, he was shocked and hurt, &quot;It turns out that this is what Abang thinks. It turns out that he has always felt that he is a shadow. I can&#39;t be with you.&quot; I talk too much about my inner feelings because it really hurts.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the scene where the brothers bid farewell, Chen Zeyao instinctively expressed his feelings for his brother in sign language. &quot;I burst into tears and forgot to say my lines. Later I found out that everyone can feel it even if I don&#39;t say my lines.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Abang, next time, I say next time, I will be your brother to protect you.&quot; Adi said. More than 20 years ago, street children Abang and Adi met on the street and became brothers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For Wang Lilin, the &quot;Fudu Youth&quot; presented now has fulfilled his expectations. &quot;I want to talk about human emotions in the context of foreign workers in Fudu, and the precious warmth and goodwill between people in such a cruel and oppressive society.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;What about Wu Kangren, right? What can we expect from &quot;Fudu Youth&quot;?&quot; we asked. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Just don&#39;t lose money, it&#39;s a movie they worked so hard to make.&quot; He replied. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The day after filming wrapped, Wu Kangren posted on social media: &quot;We have done a great thing.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/ cms/medias/image/23/11/25/1Mj220voE9O4TyIqiVik3Kr0yE1Alckh7WTsQfLg.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;686&quot; height=&quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/ 23/11/25/1Mj220voE9O4TyIqiVik3Kr0yE1Alckh7WTsQfLg.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;259642&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa; &quot;>;(Wu Kangren’s personal social media account/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Clap your hands&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In 2016, Wu Kangren won the first prize with his role in &quot;A Handful of Youth&quot; The role of &quot;Guo Zhen&quot; won the Golden Bell Award for Best Actor. This is one of the most successful characters he has created, mixed with a cynical sense of youth and the vicissitudes of war and life and death, and with deep love for his lover, he was extinguished in the gunfire. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;His acceptance speech was like a plea: a plea for more resources for actors, a plea for TV stations to develop more different types of dramas. &quot;They (actors) are waiting, just like me before, waiting for someone like Director Cho Sei-won to choose me. We need more resources to help us. Maybe we are not the most talented, but we can always be the most talented. The one who works hard.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/25/6cdQYotwZsx1KCe1gvLjXjL3iGl88Q4QZOBu9i37.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width= &quot;960&quot; height=&quot;673&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/25/6cdQYotwZsx1KCe1gvLjXjL3iGl88Q4QZOBu9i37.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;259645&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt; p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;A handful of green (2015) &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Relying on government subsidies and Later, with the investment of streaming media platforms, Taiwanese dramas have been innovative in the past few years. Around 2015, &quot;A Handful of Youth&quot; and the genre dramas &quot;Exit Office&quot; and &quot;Narcotic Storm&quot; were regarded as the first new trend. After 2019, dramas that focus on social issues, such as &quot;The Distance Between Us&quot; and &quot;The Distance Between Us&quot;, mark that Taiwanese dramas have basically passed the trough period. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the above-mentioned Taiwanese dramas, Wu Kangren played the leading role. From idol dramas to realism, his acting career overlaps with the ups and downs, changes and breakthroughs of Taiwanese dramas in the past 15 years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;To be honest, I became famous because there was a shortage of people (filming) in Taiwan at that time. There were not many Taiwanese actors my age.&quot; He said in an interview with &quot;Taiwan Film&quot; at the end of 2018. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When he entered the industry, he thought that he was not outstanding in appearance and qualifications, but &quot;hard work is more important than talent.&quot; When he was working as a bartender, he didn&#39;t speak English, so after finishing work in the early morning, he would go to the all-night Eslite Bookstore, read bartending books, and memorize words in Pinyin. Many years later, when the media interviewed the bar owner, the bar owner described Wu Kangren as &quot;a life on the line&quot;: a lifetime of hard work for one thing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He went through phases of conceitedness. He knows what he is doing, he gives 200%, is strict with himself, and requires everyone around him to work as hard as he does. &quot;I used to be quite radical at work, so there were rumors that Wu Kangren was difficult to deal with. Only in the past two years have I gradually realized that this is a team work.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But precisely because Wu Kangren always emphasized hard work, He often says that he is not talented enough, and few people talk about his talent as an actor. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He has beautiful eyes and expressive features, which makes him good at performing explosive moments with complex emotions. He is good at observation and describes many details of the old district of Fudu vividly and vividly. Although he is taciturn and serious in daily life, when standing on the stage and in front of the camera, he is talkative and humorous, with rich expressions and body movements. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He is confident that he can persist in acting and yearns to be a good actor like Li Xuejian for a lifetime, but he is also not optimistic about his career as an actor. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I don&#39;t think I will always be able to act. I just want to be exposed to many possibilities earlier and faster. It may only take three to five years to act in a film. I strive for it because of fate.&quot; He thought for a while and said, &quot;You won&#39;t see &quot;Fudu Youth&quot; again in five years. I have been in the industry for 15 years and only saw &quot;Fudu Youth&quot; once.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is This is the reason why he tried a variety of unconventional roles after 2015. He wanted to know how many possibilities he had and how to improve his performance. He went to training classes to practice his vocal skills; he filmed 5 movies in 2022 and felt very at ease. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Perhaps because he does not have an agent, Wu Kangren has limited access to film resources. He has expressed his love for mainland art films several times, and he also admitted that he respects acting in mainland China. &quot;You have to be prepared before going, not just to make money and leave.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But it is also because Without an agent, Wu Kangren makes all his work decisions by himself. After experiencing a period of panic, he is now very accustomed to this way of working: he knows what is important, and he just needs to perform well. He can take care of himself. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He yearns for Hong Kong actors in the golden age of Hong Kong films, such as Tony Leung Ka-fai, Tony Leung Chiu-wai, and Andy Lau. &quot;Each actor has accumulated hundreds of films and has his own place.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p >;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/25/3ps1FPdK7ZJ6bSD1hSXs9Jb3QbmFYuu7aYJgorhx.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;1440&quot; data-src =&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/25/3ps1FPdK7ZJ6bSD1hSXs9Jb3QbmFYuu7aYJgorhx.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;259647&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text- align: center;&quot;>;In My Lifetime (2023) &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The title of &quot;In My Lifetime&quot; is Gao Jiayue&#39;s life summary. Gao Jiayue scrawled and corrected it and wrote on the back of the &quot;suicide note&quot;: It would be good to grow this big in my lifetime. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wu Kangren started working at the age of 14. The first job was to do electrical box welding with bare eyes. After work, my vision was so white that I thought I was going blind. Since then, he has worked more than 50 jobs, shuttling between 20-story scaffolding without safety helmets and safety nets, washing dishes, cutting vegetables, and entertaining guests in various restaurants. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Twenty years later, Wu Kangren was asked what he wanted to say to himself at that time. He replied:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;15-year-old Wu Kangren, the things you were afraid of at that time, None of this happened, because you didn’t learn bad things, and you are taking good care of your mother now. Your decision at that time was right, and you got a wonderful life in exchange for it, so give yourself a pat on the back.”&lt;/p>; &lt; p>;He raised his hands above his head and clapped himself. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 26 Nov 2023 10:25:05 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[首位博士说丨林超民：研究历史才能看到未来]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261332]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-26 09:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;On November 2, 2023, Lin Chaomin was at the Wu Mayao Anthropology Museum of Yunnan University.

It is close to Green Lake. Every winter, you can see the scenery from A red-billed gull flies from Siberia to spend the winter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In 1962, Lin Chaomin was admitted to Yunnan University as a history major. At that time, the Department of History gathered together scholars such as Fang Guoyu, Jiang Yingliang, Yang Kun, and Li Wei to establish the first Chinese ethnic history major. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The first time he came into contact with the ethnic history major in a relatively systematic way was due to the &quot;special task&quot; Lin Chaomin was assigned before graduation: Fang Guoyu, who would become his mentor in the future. Collect &quot;evidence of guilt&quot; from his writings. Yunda University students only have 6 library cards, but Lin Chaomin, who shoulders the &quot;task&quot;, after receiving 20 library cards, plunged into Fang Guoyu&#39;s works. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;As a result, &quot;After reading for a long time, I didn&#39;t find anything reactionary about Mr. Fang, but I myself became interested in the study of national history.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Later, due to various reasons, this class of history students who were full of expectations for the future were collectively sent to farms for re-education after six years of undergraduate studies. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In May 1970, Lin Chaomin was assigned to work as a worker in the Menghai Tea Factory in Xishuangbanna Province, and later taught in Menghai No. 1 Middle School. During this period, he was appreciated by Ren Jiyu, professor of the Department of Philosophy at Peking University, for an article discussing Confucius&#39; thoughts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In 1978, Lin Chaomin was 33 years old. He heard that he could take the postgraduate entrance examination, so he thought of the Chinese Ethnic History major at Yunnan University. But compared with the exam, getting people released from middle school was more difficult. “I went to the then county party secretary Yan Xiangkan, who was from the Blang ethnic group. When he heard that I was going to study ethnic history, I immediately Said, &#39;I hope you will study the history of our Brown people carefully.&#39;&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Some people once commented that Lin Chaomin was &quot;a pioneer in the trend.&quot; In 1985, he passed the defense , became the first doctorate in Chinese national history. One of his mentors, Jiang Yingliang, has a plan for him: &quot;He is expected to make creative achievements in the study of ethnic history. We hope that he will not be held in administrative affairs, which will affect his research and teaching.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;However, after graduating from the Ph.D., he was immediately appointed as the deputy director of the History Department of Yunnan University, and later served as the vice president of Yunnan University. As an administrator, he once faced the question of where the history department should go in the face of the decline of liberal arts. At that time, in the context of difficulty in recruiting students, allocating resources, and generating income, many teachers called the history department a &quot;shit pit&quot; and shouted that they should jump out of the &quot;shit pit.&quot; pit&quot;. During his tenure, Lin Chaomin successively organized and applied for history base classes, established anthropology, social work and other majors, and established the first Institute of Film and Television Anthropology in Asia, allowing this university located in the southwest border to seize the opportunity in the discipline establishment. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;After retirement, Lin Chaomin can spend time on research. In recent years, he has paid special attention to the integrity of Chinese history. On October 28, 2023, he organized a seminar on Fang Guoyu&#39;s historical thoughts to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the publication of the theory &quot;On the Integration of Chinese Historical Development&quot; and the 120th anniversary of Fang Guoyu&#39;s birth. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On November 2, 2023, on the campus of Yunnan University, Lin Chaomin accepted an exclusive interview with a reporter from Southern Weekend. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;Lin Chaomin&#39;s doctoral thesis defense scene, taken in 1985.

When the Japanese occupied Tengchong in 1942, my parents fled to Dali, where I was born. After the Chinese Expeditionary Force recaptured Tengchong in September 1944, we came back from Dali. At that time, Tengchong was bombed by aircraft and artillery due to the Anti-Japanese War. The city was in rubble, with almost no standing house. The central primary school where we study is the Confucian Temple. The Japanese used it as a headquarters before. It has been preserved because of its strong construction. There are still many bullet holes in the walls and pillars inside. When I was in sixth grade, the school was building a sports ground and we dug up a lot of bullet casings and bayonets from Type 38 rifles. It wasn’t until I graduated from high school in 1962 and entered college that I left Tengchong. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;When I was young, I didn’t know what to do, I just knew that I wanted to read good books. At that time, my mother subscribed to different magazines for each age group of us brothers and sisters. For example, when I was very young, I read &quot;Children&quot;, &quot;Red Scarf&quot;, &quot;Middle School Students&quot; and &quot;Youth Literature&quot;. Later, when I was older, I read &quot;Students&quot; published in the Republic of China. Youwenku&quot;. At that time, I read Lin Handa&#39;s &quot;New Collection of Stories from the Eastern Zhou Dynasty&quot;, &quot;New Collection of Stories from the Later and Later Han Dynasties&quot;, &quot;Stories of the Three Kingdoms&quot;, &quot;Tai Shi Not Afraid of Death&quot;, etc., and developed a strong interest in history. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Why did you apply in the end?

Roads, ditches, reservoirs, he often told me that after the founding of the People&#39;s Republic of China, the motherland must be industrialized, and you should study engineering and work hard for modernization. My mother was a middle school teacher. During the anti-rightist movement in 1957, many liberal arts teachers in Tengchong No. 1 Middle School were misclassified. My mother said that we could not study liberal arts because it would be easy to make mistakes, so I always wanted to study science and engineering. Later, my mother also advocated that I study medicine because it would be useful at any time. In high school, I was good in all subjects, but I excelled in liberal arts. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;I was a senior in high school in 1962. After the graduation exam last semester, the school divided us into three groups according to the subjects we applied for. One group was science and engineering. The other group is medicine and agriculture, and the other group is liberal arts. My family decided to choose science and engineering, but when it came to the specific subjects, I was assigned to the liberal arts group under the arrangement of the head teacher, Chinese teacher, and history teacher. At that time, I went to Baoshan, Yunnan to take the college entrance examination, and I sent out application letters before the exam. Each person can fill in five choices, so I filled out the history departments of Peking University, Renmin University of China, Nanjing University, Fudan and Yunda University, and was later admitted to Yunda University. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Why was Yunda University at that time Is the history department a &quot;five-year system&quot;? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Lin Chaomin:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Our history department only had one major: history, and we recruited 32 people.

The curriculum arrangement is that the first, second and third grade students take basic courses, such as ancient literature, politics, foreign languages, Chinese and foreign general history, etc., and the fourth grade is divided into &quot;specialized (groups)&quot;. When I was studying, there were three special groups: Chinese national history, ancient Chinese economic history, and modern Chinese economic history. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;I didn’t study well when I was in college. Since 1958, labor education has been relatively common in universities. The central government formulated the Sixty Articles for Higher Education, emphasizing the emphasis on teaching. At that time, the Ministry of Education stipulated that students should attend labor classes for five weeks in a school year, which implied that it could not exceed five weeks. But in reality it’s more than five weeks of labor each school year. At that time, Yunnan University had three farms, growing rice, corn, wheat, vegetables, as well as apple orchards and pig farms. In addition, there was a lot of public welfare work, such as planting trees in the mountains, and supporting spring plowing and autumn harvesting during busy farming periods. Later, when Kunming was building a railway station, we were asked to help. In 1961, after a survey, the Ministry of Higher Education found that students had to work and go to school at the same time, and could not learn much in four years, so they decided to turn key universities into five-year institutions, and Yunda University was also changed to a five-year institution. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You studied under Mr. Fang Guoyu when you were a graduate student because you went to Fang Sir&#39;s class? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Lin Chaomin:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;When I was in college, Mr. Fang was responsible for the national task of compiling the southwest part of China’s historical map. He only teaches graduate students, and ethnic history is a senior professional course that is only taken in the fourth grade and is taught by his assistants Mr. You Zhong and Mr. Mu Qin. On April 20, 1963, Mr. Fang gave a speech on &quot;On the Integration of China&#39;s Historical Development&quot; at school. I met him for the first time, but because he was from Lijiang and of the Naxi ethnic group, he had a strong accent and I didn&#39;t understand much. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;But I was deeply impressed after reading the article. In September 1966, when I was a senior in college, classes were suspended again due to the &quot;Cultural Revolution&quot;, and the school began to engage in mass criticism to criticize reactionary academic authority. At that time, Yunnan University established a large criticism group, which included a Chinese group and a history group. The history group mainly criticized the &quot;three mountains&quot; of the history department. The first one was Fang Guoyu who &quot;represented&quot; feudalism, and the second one was &quot; Jiang Yingliang (who once served as county magistrate in Che, now Jinghong) represents &quot;bureaucratic capitalism&quot;, and the third one &quot;represents&quot; imperialism is Yang Kun (studied at the University of Sino-French in Lyon, France). There are five or six classmates in the history group I am in. The group members do not need to study in the department. Two young teachers organize us to go to these old gentlemen&#39;s books and find questions from the books. The average college student only has 6 library cards. , our criticism group has 20 library cards, and can go into the library to check books. It was also at this time that I dug out all of Mr. Fang&#39;s works and read them. His &quot;Inspection Notes on the Western Yunnan Border Area&quot; talked about his field trips to the Awa Mountains in the Lincang border area. I was very interested in reading it and felt that it was well written. Very good, no problems found. I didn’t write an article criticizing Mr. Fang. Instead, I learned about the social history of border areas and the customs and customs of ethnic minorities, and felt that his &quot;On the Integration of Chinese Historical Development&quot; and other articles were good articles for safeguarding national unity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;Fang Guoyu (first from left) instructs Lin Chaomin (second from left), photographed in Professor Fang Guoyu&#39;s study in March 1973.

The more popular ones are in the modern history group. Every school has party history. Courses are in great demand for employment. Previously, all students majoring in modern history were assigned to the General Political Department of the People&#39;s Liberation Army. In addition, many people go to the Department of Philosophy and Social Sciences of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (now the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences). At that time, Yunda University&#39;s ethnic history major was ranked first in the country. Those who studied the history of Dai, Yi, Bai, and Naxi people in the Institute of Ethnology of the Department of Philosophy and Social Sciences were all Yunda graduates. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Logically speaking, we should have graduated in July 1967, but until October 1968, except for a few in agriculture and medicine, our group of college students Except for majors, all were sent to farms to receive re-education and labor training. It was not until April 1970 that work began to be assigned. At that time, it was stipulated that college students should achieve &quot;four orientations&quot;, facing the grassroots, facing the countryside, facing the industry and mining, and facing the frontier. At the time of the distribution, no one wanted to go to Xishuangbanna. I read Mr. Fang&#39;s &quot;Inspection Notes on the Western Yunnan Border Region&quot;, Mr. Jiang Yingliang&#39;s &quot;Economic Life of the Paiyi&quot;, &quot;Life and Culture of the Paiyi&quot;, etc., and I was very interested in the border ethnic groups, so I Take the initiative to sign up to go to Xishuangbanna. In May 1970, when I arrived in Menghai County, Xishuangbanna, I was assigned to be a worker in the Menghai Tea Factory. I was transferred to the factory from time to time to write work summaries, publicity reports, etc. In 1972, Menghai No. 1 Middle School opened a high school and needed high school teachers, but the factory refused to let them go. It wasn’t until 1973 that I was transferred as a history and Chinese teacher. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;I heard you are When working at the Menghai Tea Factory, he was also appreciated by Professor Ren Jiyu of Peking University? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Lin Chaomin:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I work 8 hours a day in the tea factory, and the rest of the time is my own. When I was in college, I was very interested in the history of Chinese thought. I read Hou Wailu&#39;s &quot;General History of Chinese Thought&quot;, Zhao Jibin&#39;s &quot;A New Exploration of the Analects&quot;, Guo Moruo&#39;s &quot;Ten Critiques&quot;, etc., and took notes. When I went to Menghai, I brought a copy of the &quot;Four Books&quot; with me. In his spare time, he wrote an article about Confucius&#39; thought and sent it to Professor Li Cuo in the department for his advice. He gave the article to Professor Zhang Deguang, an expert in the history of ancient Chinese thought, and Mr. Zhang recommended it to Ren Jiyu. Mr. Ren wrote me back a letter, saying that in a remote place like Xishuangbanna, it was not easy for me to persist in studying Confucius and write such an article. However, he also pointed out that my article did not criticize Confucius enough. Mr. Ren also sent me a copy of &quot;A Brief History of Chinese Philosophy&quot; edited by him. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In 1972, Mr. Ren wrote to me and told me that Peking University was preparing to recruit 10 graduate students in the history of Chinese philosophy. He hoped that I would be ready. Admitted to his graduate school. So I studied foreign languages ​​every day, systematically studied the history of Chinese philosophy, and often wrote to him for advice. But then the Zhang Tiesheng hand-in-the-blank incident happened, and Mr. Ren wrote to me to tell me that the recruitment of graduate students had been stopped, and that in the future, graduate students would also be recruited through the recommendation of workers, peasants and soldiers. I wouldn&#39;t have a chance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Until 1978, it was restored During the postgraduate enrollment period, you were finally able to take the postgraduate entrance examination, but why didn’t you contact Professor Ren Jiyu again? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Lin Chaomin:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I also thought about writing to Mr. Ren and doing research on the history of philosophy with him, but I was in Xishuangbanna at the time, and my thoughts changed.

Later, when I became a middle school teacher, some students asked me questions about ethnic minorities, and I couldn’t answer them. , at this time, I remembered the research on ethnic minorities by Mr. Fang Guoyu and Mr. Jiang Yingliang. I felt that there were more people doing the history of philosophy in the country, but too few people doing the history of ethnic groups, which was not popular, so I chose to study under Mr. Fang’s graduate school. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;In the 1960s, Lin Chaomin planted vegetables and watered vegetables at the PLA farm.

I didn’t understand it at that time. When I was reporting, he asked me how many books I had read. I said I had only read a few books, and he said it’s not good for you to read books like this. I read them one book at a time, but flipped through the bookshelves one by one. He asked me to start with bibliography and read books such as &quot;Summary of the General Catalog of All Siku&quot;, &quot;Diagnosis of Synopsis of Siku&quot; by Yu Jiaxi, and &quot;Answers to the Bibliography&quot; by Zhang Zhidong. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Mr. Fang has never criticized me directly. When I was studying for my master&#39;s degree, I wrote some small articles in &quot;Yunnan Daily&quot;. Mr. Fang just said, You haven&#39;t read enough books yet. What you posted in &quot;Yunnan Daily&quot; is just a trivial skill, building blocks. Your task is to build a tall building.

He does not advocate rushing to publish articles and believes that first Read good books. He said that no article should be refried, and if there is no new idea, don’t write an article. He said that some people nowadays do not study seriously, but are busy writing articles, rushing to publish articles, and eager for quick success. Many articles are about stir-fried twice-cooked pork. This won&#39;t work! Doctoral students do not use pigs raised by others to make steamed pork, Qianzhang pork, or braised pork. Instead, they have to cultivate new pig species themselves, create something, and invent something. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Later, I summarized doctoral studies as having all five &quot;unique&quot; aspects.

In 1939, Mr. Fang wrote &quot;Bo People and Baizi&quot; and published it in &quot;Yi Shi Bao&quot;, criticizing the fallacy of the British and French in describing Nanzhao as an independent country established by the Dai people. His study of border issues was not only In order to examine historical issues, but to maintain national unity and national unity. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In 1963, Mr. Fang published &quot;On the Integration of China&#39;s Historical Development&quot; and began to talk about the integrity of China&#39;s historical development. The article aims at the absurd remarks of some scholars at home and abroad who regard Chinese history as a single history of the Han people and exclude the history of non-Han Chinese ethnic minorities from Chinese history. It points out that the development of Chinese history has always been a whole, and that history and reality, the Central Plains and the Central Plains are The border areas, the Han and ethnic minorities, the Chinese nation, etc. are all one entity. Chinese history refers to the history of the people of all ethnic groups living on this land. It should include their entire history and cannot be &quot;changed or expanded.&quot; Chinese history has its own integrity. Within the whole, no matter how many regimes appear and no matter how inconsistent the politics, the whole has not been broken. China as a whole should be the scope of history, not the territory of past dynasties. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Later I assisted Mr. Fang in teaching the local history of Yunnan, and he reiterated this point of view in the introduction to &quot;Lecture Notes on the Local History of Yunnan&quot;. When Yunnan University celebrated its 70th anniversary in 1983, he guided me to write an article called &quot;Several Issues Related to the Thirty-seven Alliance Oath Monuments in Dali&quot;, which also used this monument to talk about the unification of Chinese history. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;From an international perspective , some historians may also hold other views on the unified view of history. How should we understand the border issue? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Lin Chaomin:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Border issues are relatively complex. In the past, China had no border issues, only the relationship between China and the four barbarians, which meant the &quot;five-party republic&quot; between China and the four barbarians and &quot;the unification of the world, the seamless connection between China and barbarians&quot;. From the central to the local governments, they were one whole. Even during the period of division, both Han and ethnic minorities pursued &quot;unification of the world&quot; and regarded the dynasties they established as Chinese orthodoxy; the dynasty systems they established were based on inheriting the Qin and Han systems and did not change the overall Economic, political, and cultural structures. Because all ethnic groups have lived together for a long time, they have already formed a complementary and unified production and lifestyle, which has given birth to a very inclusive and absorbing Chinese civilization, allowing the Chinese nation to form a strong cohesion based on &quot;commonality&quot;. Even during the period of division, this way of production and life has not changed, the political system has not changed, the overall consciousness has not changed, and the culture has continued. This is reflected in the national outlook and national outlook as the &quot;grand unified&quot; national outlook and the overall consciousness of the Chinese nation. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Modern frontier studies began to rise because of the arrival of Western colonialism from the East. The first is the political &quot;frontier&quot;. In history, the division and reunification of many places was a process of development. For example, Yunnan was Nanzhao in the Tang Dynasty. In the 10th year of Zhenyuan (794), the Yunnan Pacifying Department was established, and the Jiannan Jiedushi was appointed as the Yunnan Pacifying Envoy. It is an autonomous local government. Dali State was also an autonomous local government. Mongolia pacified Dali in 1253, and the Yuan Dynasty established a province in Yunnan in 1274. The Yuan Dynasty also established the province of Myanmar, which was later placed under the administration of Yunnan Province. It is a chieftain land under the jurisdiction of Yunnan Province. After the founding of New China, the China-Myanmar border was officially delimited in 1961. China erected the No. 1 boundary monument of the People&#39;s Republic of China on the border with Tengchong. Indicates that we formally respect the demarcation of borders under international law, that is, borders under international law. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;There are also cultural borders. For example, the culture of the Wa people in China and the Wa state in northern Myanmar have many similarities. Although there are political boundaries at this time, But in fact, we all have the same culture and history, and we are a community with a shared future. Therefore, from a domestic perspective, it is the integrity of the Chinese nation, and from a foreign perspective, it should be regarded as a community. Domestically, we safeguard China&#39;s integrity and safeguard national unity. Internationally, we build a community with a shared future for mankind. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;Lin Chaomin&#39;s doctoral thesis is entitled &quot;Anbeiting Protectorate and the Western Frontier of the Tang Dynasty&quot;, taken in 1985.

Each department wants to generate income. Teachers in the Department of Economics and Foreign Languages, for example, can give lectures and tutors to earn extra money. Although the salary is the same, their extra money is several times that of ours. At that time, some teachers majoring in history said that they should think beyond the &quot;shit&quot; pit&quot;. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Students&#39; thoughts were not very stable, so I put forward a point of view. History may seem useless, but useless things are very useful. I told the students that the tables, chairs, benches, doors, windows, and lights in the classroom are all useful, but what is invisible and useless is the space. But without this space, there would be nowhere to put the tables, chairs, benches, and lights. History is human time and space. You can&#39;t see or touch it, but you can&#39;t live without it at all times. It&#39;s very useful anytime and anywhere. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Later, the Ministry of Education proposed to build 10 &quot;bases&quot; in each of the three major categories of literature, history, and philosophy. When the document was issued to the school, it was less than the application deadline. For 5 days, I filled out the application form day and night, and stated at the review meeting that Yunnan University is a border university, inferior to Peking University, Fudan University, etc. in many aspects, but its research on border issues and ethnic issues is unique in the country and is related to national unity. , national unity, which is irreplaceable by other schools. The characteristics of the History Department of Yunda University are borderlands and ethnic groups, which cannot be replaced by any other school. In this way, in 1987, Yunda University became one of the 10 bases. The base class has brought new opportunities to Yunda University. The state invests 300,000 yuan in construction funds for the base class every year, and more than half of the students can be recommended to graduate school. Employment after graduation is no longer a problem. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Later, you also Did you encounter any difficulties in establishing the ethnology and social work majors? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Lin Chaomin:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;In 1986, I proposed that Yunda University should establish an ethnology major, and the school leaders were very supportive. , reported to the Yunnan Provincial Education Commission, the Education Commission said that ethnology is run by the Nationalities College, and it is not appropriate to have two ethnology majors in one province. In the end, it was not completed. Later, I rewrote the report and applied to establish the anthropology major. In 1987, the State Education Commission approved Yunda to establish the anthropology major. We are the second anthropology major in a national university. The first one is Xiamen University, and the first one with an anthropology department is Sun Yat-sen University. In 1988, we enrolled the first batch of undergraduate students. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;After the Anthropology major was established in 1988, I began to plan to apply for the Sociology major. In July 1939, Wu Wenzao founded the Department of Sociology at Yunda University. By 1954, the Department of Sociology was abolished, and the head of the department at that time was Mr. Yang Kun. In 1984 and 1986, I visited Mr. Yang twice at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. Mr. Yang repeatedly told me that it was wrong to abolish the Department of Sociology and that it should be restored and rebuilt as soon as possible. I brought his opinions back to school and reported them to the leaders. Although they were ignored, I always kept his words in mind. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In October 1990, I visited the United States to study. I knew that social work is a major that is very needed by society. Social development will bring many problems and requires specialized professionals. Social workers come to the rescue. Both rich and poor have social problems. When I passed through Hong Kong when I returned to China, I went to some universities to learn about the social work major. One of their social work features is to help disadvantaged groups, the poor, the unemployed, the disabled, etc. After I came back, I told the school that if the sociology major could not be offered, we would not be able to offer it. Social work major. At that time, most people in the academic affairs office of the school did not know what social work was, so I explained it over and over again. After the school agreed, it was reported to the Provincial Education Commission and the National Education Commission, and it was quickly approved.

Just like air, we can&#39;t see or touch it, but we can&#39;t live without it for a moment. We study history in order to create the future. To move forward, we can only ask about history; only by learning from history can we create the future. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(Southern Weekend intern Huang Xiaoying also contributed to this article)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt; /p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https:// feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.run&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.run&lt;/a>;&lt;br>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 26 Nov 2023 09:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[徐卓媛：因为喜爱去攀登]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261243]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-26 08:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 11/22/jlh4uLkDEV5I0wjzaQur3Al4838vctWvTfIIMEXL.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;719&quot; height=&quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/22/jlh4uLkDEV5I0wjzaQur3Al4838vctWv TfIIMEXL. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;259209&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Picture from Honor 100 series Photography/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In mid-May 2023, after nearly 10 hours of arduous climbing, Changsha girl Xu Zhuoyuan successfully climbed to the summit of Mount Everest. Four years ago, she once shouted &quot;I want to climb Mount Everest&quot; on a variety show. Four years later, at the age of 16, she fulfilled her promise with practical actions and became the youngest person in China to climb Mount Everest from the south slope. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Influenced by her father, Xu Zhuoyuan started climbing when she was very young. When she was 4 years old, her parents took her to climb Mount Siguniang and unexpectedly found that she adapted well to altitude sickness. When she was 12 years old, she traveled to Tibet with her father Xu Jianglei. At that time, she regretted not being able to see the sunrise on Mount Everest due to weather conditions. On the way back, she climbed the peak of Mount Siguniang with her father. “It was my first time to climb a snow-capped mountain in a real sense.” From then on, she buried her desire to climb Mount Everest. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Mountain climbing is an extreme sport that relies on luck. Since she came into contact with climbing, her mood has become more stable. &quot;People often die during climbing. Now for me, life and death are no big deal.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt; p>;This climb six months ago was Xu Zhuoyuan’s first challenge on Mount Everest. Before setting off, she packed her father Xu Jianglei&#39;s gloves when he climbed Mount Everest into his backpack, hoping to keep them as &quot;a kind of inheritance.&quot; In 2007, Xu Jianglei climbed to the summit of Mount Everest, becoming the first person in Hunan Province to summit Mount Everest. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xu Zhuoyuan remembered that when she was approaching the summit, the Sherpa guide beside her reminded her that she was almost at the top and it was still dark. &quot;The only thought in my mind was that I must see the top of Mount Everest.&quot; At sunrise on the mountain, my father’s summit photo has always impressed me. In the photo, he is high-spirited and smiling brightly facing the sun. I can feel his love for the snow-capped mountains. That photo is still displayed in my home. .&quot; Fortunately, the sun came out almost at the moment she reached the top. Now, next to a picture of her father, there is a picture of her reaching the summit, with the rising sun behind her. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;I want to climb Mount Everest&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot; >;When you were 12 years old, you said &quot;I want to climb Mount Everest&quot; on a show. What did you think at the time? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xu Zhuoyuan:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>; Ever since I was a child, Mount Everest has always had a different meaning to me. The summer after I graduated from elementary school when I was 12 years old, my father took me to Tibet, but due to the weather, I didn’t see the Rizhao Jinshan Mountain. Later, my father and I went to climb the peak of Siguniang Mountain together. This was my first time to truly climb a snow-capped mountain. It snowed on the mountain at that time. As a southerner, I found it very novel. From then on, I very much hoped to have the opportunity to climb Mount Everest to watch the sunrise. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;After setting that goal at the age of 12, my father How to say? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xu Zhuoyuan:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;He was quite shocked at the time. He didn’t expect that I would have this idea, and he probably thought that I wouldn’t really take action. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Did you set a deadline for yourself at that time? ? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xu Zhuoyuan:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;What I wanted at that time was to complete it as soon as possible.

It is indeed difficult to balance them, but if you really love it, you will try your best. All ways to balance. My current high school coursework is very heavy, and my mountaineering training is also very heavy, so I will fill up all my free time and study ahead of schedule. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Climbing to the top is not success, returning home is&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: italics, italics _GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;How did you feel when you climbed to the top of Mount Everest? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xu Zhuoyuan:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I thought I would be very excited. Climbing to the top would be regarded as fulfilling my dream of the past four years, but I didn’t know it was because the weather was too bad at that time. Cold and high altitude can compress some of people&#39;s emotions, but I&#39;m actually quite calm. I remember taking out the flags in my bag one by one, taking pictures, and then calling my mother to report that everything was safe. Because the weather was so bad and there was a heavy snowstorm, the Sherpa guide urged me to retreat quickly, so I thought about retreating quickly. At that time, my parents suggested that I stay at Camp 2 for one more day and take a helicopter back to Everest Base Camp the next day. But I stayed on the mountain for 8 days. I didn’t take a shower or have an Internet connection for 8 days. This actually reached the limit for me. I threw my sleeping bag and moisture-proof mat directly to Camp 4 and decided to return to the base camp that day. , so it took me 22 hours to withdraw that day. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;In addition to not being able to take a shower, as a girl, you What difficulties did you encounter during the climb? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xu Zhuoyuan:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;In fact, women have more inconveniences when climbing than men, such as washing and going to the toilet. But both men and women are equal in front of the mountain, but women have to work harder to achieve this goal. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 凯体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;In the 8 days without the Internet, you have nothing but What are you doing for training? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xu Zhuoyuan: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>; Mainly training. We adapted to Camp 2 for 3 days, and then we were waiting for news from Camp 3 to see the road construction team. Can it be cultivated to the top? We were very lucky. If the road construction team had not repaired it at that time, we might have to withdraw to the Everest base camp and wait for the next cycle. The rest of the time, I would chat with my teammates on the mountaineering team, play cards, and fight against altitude sickness. I vomited violently the night I first arrived at Everest Base Camp. I don’t know if it was because I was not used to the climate in Nepal, so I rested for about two days before recovering. Later, I was training alone with my teammates at the base camp. My mother called me and advised me to withdraw. So this is also my first time to climb a mountain without my parents. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Didn’t you think about withdrawing it at that time? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xu Zhuoyuan: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Maybe I am a bit stubborn, thinking that I have suffered so much and have to climb so many snow-capped mountains in one day before climbing Mount Everest.

Feeling humiliated and excited at the same time, he opened the first page of the computer document and read &quot;Mistake by the River&quot; in enlarged font size. Below it were two lines of small characters, original work: Yu Hua, director: Wei Shujun. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He wants to adapt this novella published in 1988. The perpetrators of the three murders all pointed to madmen, but they could not build a complete chain of evidence to bring him to justice, which made both the town and the criminal police captain Ma Zhe uneasy. Writer Yu Hua&#39;s parody of detective novels in the avant-garde literature period used violent absurdity as the surface and subversion of tradition as the core. I have sold the copyright several times but have never changed it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The difficult thing is to find a word that points to the philosophy behind all suspenseful stories. In 2021, Wei Shujun and screenwriter Kang Chunlei entered the second year of their adaptation. After overturning the general direction twice, they were determined to find the word. They searched for two days and two nights, wandering around the house until they got something. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;Bug.&quot; He was quite satisfied with this new development. &quot;It is a word born from the progress of information technology. It is a vulnerability problem based on code and the best rational logic. We think it is too accurate. , isn&#39;t our &quot;Yong&#39;an Town Story Collection&quot; called &#39;Ripples of Life&#39;, this one is called &#39;Bugs of Life&#39;.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It was August 2021, and Wei Shujun was preparing to shoot a new film in Northeast China &quot;White Crane Spreads Wings&quot;. After work, the crew plays badminton together. However, indoor venues have been closed due to the new crown epidemic, and they are planning to play basketball outdoors instead. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A month ago, his second feature film &quot;The Story of Yong&#39;an Town&quot; was selected for the Directors&#39; Fortnight section of the Cannes Film Festival; a year ago, his first feature film &quot;Wild Horse Parting Mane&quot; was nominated for the Cannes Newcomer Award. As a feature film director, his graduate work &quot;Yanbian Boy&quot; won the Cannes Short Film Special Mention Award. He received critical acclaim when he first appeared on the scene. Industry seniors and critics praised his talents and talents, and were curious about the possibilities he brought to the table. sex. Wei Shujun received attention as a result. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the adaptation of &quot;The Mistake by the River&quot; quickly fell into another strange circle. Bugs do not exist alone. To describe rational loopholes and loss of control, the premise is to explain what rationality is. The argument about rationality is a wide-ranging, academic discussion that is energy-consuming and unnecessary. &quot;We looked in the wrong direction again,&quot; we had to give up. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;By chance, while scouting locations in Hangzhou, Wei Shujun felt that there should be a dream at the end of the story. &quot;The causes of their deaths are not completely connected on a rational level and cannot serve to solve the case. But in the dream, they interlock with each other, as if they are all established, revealing a certain inevitability in a series of accidents, giving people a creepy feeling.&quot; In the final version of the script, dreams became the core sequence. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This seems to be his consistent creative approach, which values ​​the true feelings of the creative subject and expresses them effectively in the film. Photography director Cheng Ma, who has worked with him three times, provided evidence: &quot;We basically create based on our feelings.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Cheng Ma and Wei Shujun met for the first time in Shanghai three years ago, and they chatted quite well. . They have many consensuses on the nature and creative concepts of movies, two of which are simple but very important: movies were created to create &quot;realistic illusions&quot; at the beginning, and they should still be so today, and movies may not be the best way to tell stories. It is a medium, but it is a channel for storing and transmitting the creator’s feelings. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, regarding &quot;The Mistake by the River&quot;, Wei Shujun told Cheng Ma that it was restrained, quiet, and elegant, and that many things happened on a humid and rainy day. This was how he felt when reading the novel. Accordingly, Cheng Ma felt that the images should be consistent with the 1990s, when the characters were wandering and out of place, and geographical features such as counties or towns were far away, not close. Cheng Ma suggested shooting on 16mm film, and they hit it off immediately. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In November 2022, with 45 days left before filming, the crew arrived in Nanfeng, Jiangxi Province, where the filming took place, to make preparations. The actors were busy with their own work. Tong Linkai had to practice splits and back fists. Zhu Yilong wore a leather jacket to visit the local police and gained 30 pounds to achieve an overworked figure. Zeng Meihuizi was also making herself gain weight in order to look like a pregnant woman. The crew cooked together, watched movies, and played badminton. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“I think the best state of creation is when all the main creators are relaxed. I don’t like that kind of tense, night-and-night (state) like a repair project, which is very tiring. That is to say, although it is You are working, but you still have your own life order, and you still retain your pursuit of beauty and passion for life.&quot; Wei Shujun said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He often carries a film camera with him - the crew has a total of more than 20 film cameras, and even a darkroom for developing black and white photos - to capture the daily life of the crew. There are more saved in the photo album on his mobile phone. When he opens it and looks through it, he sees friends meeting, travel scenes, rivers, trees, and the sea. “It seems to have some kind of ability to leave time behind, making you think of it as a pleasant time.” In the afternoon, a happy state.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Relaxation is rare. What is also rare is that, in Cheng Ma&#39;s words, Wei Shujun places a particularly high importance on creation. &quot;As a director of his age, he can actually withstand a lot of pressure. We have to shoot smoothly, but many people ask us what to do with the scenes and what to do with the actors&#39; time. For example, a certain role has many scenes, but the actors can only come for 10 days in total. , the usual approach of the crew is to focus on filming all his scenes in these 10 days. But Wei Shujun feels that smooth filming is of great value to his creation, so he will give up scenes that cannot be matched by actors or at inappropriate times.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Kang Chunlei also said: &quot;I think he has an almost intuitive ability to control the scene. I always told him, you shine on the scene.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Also Once, Wei Shujun changed his character&#39;s name on the spot. In the novel, Ma Zhe&#39;s subordinate is Xiao Li, a young man who takes the initiative to report case analysis from time to time. So of course Tong Linkai’s name is Xiao Li. After a few days of filming, Wei Shujun suddenly said, thank you so much &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>; (&quot;Thanks&quot; means shit)&lt;/span>;, don&#39;t call me Xiao Li. Just call me Xiao Xie. Wei Shujun greeted other actors and revised his lines. The printed police officer ID card of Xiao Li was re-attached. Tong Linkai&#39;s role became Xiao Xie. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But to be honest, the feeling at the scene was not that wonderful. Wei Shujun&#39;s own version is: &quot;Imagine that when you were in school, you had to sit in the classroom at 7 a.m. every morning to study early. On the way from home after breakfast, you felt that you were still waking up. When you got to class, you thought about writing yesterday&#39;s homework. No, I didn’t write it, so I wrote it quickly. After I wrote it, I felt very at ease. I started to think about going to the canteen to buy something to eat during recess, and then I went to the actual class to listen to the teacher. It was the same on the set, everyone was here, Shui After brewing it, we started drinking water. We walked around the scene and the actors were almost done. Then we discussed the scene and confirmed our schedule with the photographer. Everyone prepared individually and then started to prepare for shooting. If something didn’t feel right in the first two days, Adjust it, and it feels good. If you take a few more shots, it will be time for lunch. It really feels like this.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;There is a slope every day, and you have to climb up a slope. You have to crawl over to get to that position.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;The Mistake by the River&quot; was completed accurately and efficiently, and was shortlisted for the &quot;Un Certain Regard&quot; section of the Cannes Film Festival. Five months later, it won two honors: Best Film and Cinephile Choice at the Pingyao International Film Festival. After another four days, it was released nationwide. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the end of the film, there was often chatter in the theater. Wei Shujun used a long dream to allow Ma Zhe to reveal himself in order to resolve his own uneasiness and chaos. The dream was clear, coherent but illogical. After witnessing everyone&#39;s death by the river, Ma Zhe sat on an old cinema seat and saw the director on the big screen holding a ping pong ball with the number 3 printed on it, shouting at him. ——Ma Zhe! Third class merit! In this shot where conjecture and prophecy overlap, thousands of ping pong balls roll down from the bottom of the screen and swarm towards Ma Zhe. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Everyone was very excited during the shooting. After taking one shot, everyone picked up the thousands of ping pong balls while shouting &quot;One more, another one&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the end of the show, the audience was full of doubts and endless interpretations and comments about the film, forming multiple dreams outside the screen, a kind of &quot;rationality and irrationality, the combination of the viewer and the viewer.&quot; effect&quot;. From this perspective, Wei Shujun&#39;s initial uneasiness when reading the novel, his exploration of the creator&#39;s intentions, and his several elusive moments during the adaptation were all conveyed to the audience. We think we have the answer, but in fact we have the illusion of an answer. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I am not too obsessed with pursuing the truth in life, because I feel that it is difficult to find it.&quot; Cheng Ma said that this is another consensus between him and Wei Shujun that the truth is difficult to find, &quot;the so-called The fate of your life is a random existence. You can only see its existence and don’t know the truth behind it.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The slight existentialist tendency of &quot;The Mistake by the River&quot; is just that Back to &quot;existence precedes essence&quot;, or in other words, &quot;back to the thing itself&quot;.

As a tribute to the centenary, &quot;Star Wish&quot; certainly closely follows this theme. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The background of the movie is set in a kingdom of wishes called Rosas. People come from all directions to offer their dreams to the magical King Manifico, and the king will choose the right person from them. Help them achieve it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The heroine Yasha’s biggest wish is that her grandfather’s dream comes true.

And &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;No matter what the situation, Asha was always loyal to her heart, &lt;/span>; and won more allies, and finally overthrew Manifico&#39;s rule. The dystopian nature of the movie is very un-Disney. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I don&#39;t agree with your point of view, but I will defend to the death your right to speak.&quot; Putting it here is an excellent comment. Everyone has the right to pursue their dreams, and the king cannot deny it easily. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to being good at creating dreams, Disney is also good at creating princesses. Since the release of Snow White (Disney&#39;s first animated feature film &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot;) in 1937, Disney has followed the development of the times for more than 80 years and successively launched more than a dozen characters.

Starting from this&lt;/span>;movie, Disney princesses completely got rid of the male gaze. They took off their costumes and became their own heroes. Like the &lt;span>; princesses in &quot;Moana&quot; (2016) and &quot;Legend of the Dragon&quot; (2021), they all gave up on romance. One lived her life how she wanted, and the other led her people to protect their home and country. . &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/25/0c8e54ba1a97dd0ceb9f0f15dd4a0e8d.gif&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;224&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/25/0c8e54ba1a97dd0ceb9f0f15dd4a0e8d.gif&quot; data-key=&quot;259607 &quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;And this &quot;Star Wish&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;span>; is also of the same origin&lt;/span>;. Asha dares to question and is not afraid of power. In order to protect all the residents of Rosas He did not hesitate to stand on the opposite side of King Manifico. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But compared with the previous princesses, Asha&#39;s combat effectiveness is obviously weakened. She no longer has the ability to go to heaven and earth. She is more like an ordinary person, a civilian hero who resists the aloof king. Just like the theme song of the movie sings, &quot;Maybe you are afraid but you still reach out your hand, and you will not run away because of a weak tremor.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;This may also be the century-old road that Disney has walked for itself.

Each one has a story that is compelling and extraordinary. But Yi Mengling’s story clearly does not fall into this category. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;How to define Yi Mengling seems to be an issue that the public is more interested in now. She is a model, a blogger, an Internet celebrity, and a newcomer to the film and television industry. And Yi Mengling is still making a lot of attempts and challenges. Maybe there will be more labels and identities added to her name in the future. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is widely known because of Yi Mengling’s unique style of photos and short videos. With good aesthetics, makeup and outfits, coupled with sunshine, smile and always bright attitude, Yi Mengling has gained tens of millions of fans on social platforms. She didn&#39;t take the initiative to define anything, but various labels followed, such as &quot;a sense of atmosphere&quot; and &quot;a sense of pure desire&quot;...these labels were either envy, love, or ill-intentioned. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the day of the interview, this thin girl who attracted too much attention walked up to the filming site on the second floor and greeted everyone who came her way. During the shooting break, she skillfully communicated with the photographer about technical issues, &quot;You have to trust me.&quot; When discussing a certain lighting technique, she sincerely gave her suggestions, which made the photographer laugh out loud. laugh. Yi Mengling had not eaten anything from morning to noon. When the accompanying staff hurriedly delivered the takeaway during the break, she said, &quot;Just a few bites&quot; and &quot;call me when you are ready.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This may be a more realistic look of Yi Mengling. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For a long time, some people imitated her, some people disdained her, and there were more and more discussions about her. However, Yi Mengling rarely fought with netizens, and she still only exported life related to herself. fragment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She also occasionally responds to some controversial discussions. For example, &quot;Big Mouth&quot; brings a signature smile, but also brings ridicule. Yi Mengling&#39;s response is more of self-acceptance and gratitude, which makes her unique in the field of modeling. For example, after recording her first experience in acting and variety shows, netizens compared her with female celebrities because of her acting skills and appearance. More comments about &quot;Internet celebrities should not enter the entertainment industry&quot; followed. But in Yi Mengling&#39;s view, she treats the world as a big playground and is an experiential player. It takes courage to try different things and challenge different things, but she thinks the process of taking the challenge is cool, and she is also cool if she chooses to challenge herself. &quot;No matter what the result is, it is all experience. I think it is worth it.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Everyone likes Yi Mengling. In addition to her beauty, they also like her calm personality. Many times, she is trying her best to relieve some anxiety and output some positive energy. For example, she appeared without makeup, shared her tips behind taking photos, and posted photos of her belly with meat after meals, making everyone feel that beauty is not a statue, but a living person. Similarly, such behavior will still cause dissatisfaction. Some people feel that this is deliberate or a &quot;concave and down-to-earth persona&quot;. No matter what she said, Yi Mengling accepted it all. In her opinion, she actually has nothing to be taboo about. As a public figure, it is essential to face criticism. Many of the things others said were exaggerated, so just laugh after reading them. Yi Mengling said: &quot;Try not to fall into the vicious circle of self-evidence. After all, explanations are never-ending.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She is an amateur and has a place on the Internet with her own advantages. It seems that all internet celebrities can be found in her, but she cannot be classified into the same category as anyone. Yi Mengling&#39;s story may not be complicated, but no matter what, she fought her way out of the siege in a place where the fighting was more intense. To a certain extent, whether the public recognizes it or not, she has courage, tenacity and strength beyond her age. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;About an ordinary girl becoming the focus of the spotlight, how does she face all this? The following is Yi Mengling’s answer. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;Rather than being self-consistent, it is better to say that I am trying to find growth here&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font- family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Do you still remember the turning points that you think are important?

After all, your job and identity require a lot of output. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Yi Mengling:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;In addition to traveling to different places and meeting people from all walks of life, a new hobby I have this year is listening to podcasts . Listening to podcasts is a good choice when doing housework at home or taking a bath. The content of many programs is very current, and the angles and viewpoints are also very novel. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Our theme this time is &quot;New Faces&quot; &quot;, what &quot;new things&quot; do you think you bring to everyone? New also means not repeating yourself, which means a lot. What is the state or appearance that you hope to always maintain? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Yi Mengling: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Trying different challenges, breaking conventions and comfort zones are all things I want to show everyone the new me. I want my status to be undefined. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You feel that you have gained Which ones are worth losing, and which ones are lost that you really don’t want to lose? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Yi Mengling: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I think the biggest gain is my growth. From a child who didn’t understand anything, to now I have become a person worth going to. The &quot;adults&quot; I rely on have made a lot of progress in both my abilities and my mentality. What I regret to lose may still be some &quot;willful rights&quot;. In the past, I could post whatever I wanted, and there would not be so many interpretations. Now, as a public figure, I really need to restrain myself with words and deeds. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Do you think it is very important to prove yourself? Difficult things? At what point did you have a strong desire to prove yourself? Or say no? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Yi Mengling: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I am more of a &quot;Buddha&quot;. Nothing must be proven to someone. Everything in the process must be proven. Do your best and leave the result to time and fate. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;What will you do to eliminate your own bad habits? mood? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Yi Mengling: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Go travel, nature will give you the most primitive healing and peace. When you are far away from the city, you will feel that the starry sky is infinite, and we are just a small dot on one of the planets. In a long time, the things we encounter are actually so insignificant. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 25 Nov 2023 21:25:04 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
