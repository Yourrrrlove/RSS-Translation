Netizens ridiculed Jinxing&#39;s fighting behavior to attract business, &quot;Is this a &#39;business war&#39;?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In fact, Jinxing&#39;s &quot;business war&quot; has always been quite controversial. Fierce, from competing for the surname &quot;Zhou&quot; to now &quot;fighting&quot; to compete for the market. Is such low-quality competition really conducive to the long-term development of domestic jewelry companies? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/23/wGz3dhhd4CDXkvhPLQvgDrkH4GxKYoxNfI5u1tMC.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/23/wGz3dhhd4CDXkvhPLQvgDrkH4GxKYoxNfI5u1tMC.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;259328&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; >;&lt;strong>;Robbing for the surname &quot;Zhou&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Many consumers who don’t know much about gold brands have inevitably encountered such confusion: Why do so many gold companies have the surname &quot;Zhou&quot;? For example, Chow Tai Fook, Chow Sang Sang, Chow Tai Sang, Saturday Fook, Chow Jin Sang, Chow Pak Fook, Chow Fu Sang... In fact, the founders of many of them are not named &quot;Chow&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Chow Tai Fook is a well-known old brand. As early as 1929, Chow Tai Fook&#39;s founder Zhou Zhiyuan founded the first &quot;Chow Tai Fook Gold Store&quot; on Hongde Road, Guangzhou, mainly selling traditional gold jewelry. In the 1930s, due to the current situation, Zhou Zhiyuan moved Chow Tai Fook Bank from Guangzhou to Macau, and later opened a branch in Hong Kong. In 2011, Chow Tai Fook was listed in Hong Kong. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Chow Sang Sang is also an old brand, and the founder is also named Zhou. In 1934, Shunde native Zhou Fangpu founded Jinhang in Guangzhou. From the 1930s to the 1940s, Chow Sang Sang had opened many branches in Hong Kong and Macao. Chow Sang Sang was listed in 1973. It was the first listed gold and jewelry company in Hong Kong. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Chow Tai Sang was established much later than Chow Tai Fook and Chow Sang Sang. It opened its first counter in Wangfujing Department Store in Beijing in 1999 and was listed on the Shenzhen Main Board in 2017. The founder of Zhou Dasheng, Zhou Zongwen, is from Fuqing, Fujian Province, but his surname is indeed &quot;Zhou&quot;, so there is nothing wrong with naming the gold bank Zhou Dasheng. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Saturday Fu&#39;s surname is &quot;Zhou&quot;, which has caused a lot of controversy. In 2004, Li Weipeng and Chen Chuangjin jointly invested in the establishment of Saturday Fortune. In 2005, Chen Chuangjin transferred 50% of the equity held by Li Weipeng to Li Weizhu, Li Weipeng&#39;s brother. In other words, the founder and current head of Saturday Fortune is named &quot;Li&quot;. The name of Luk Fook will also cause consumers to confuse it with &quot;Luk Fook Jewelry&quot;. Lukfook Jewelry was established in Hong Kong in 1991 and listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in 1997. It is more senior than Lukfook. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Some jewelry brands named &quot;Zhou&quot; that appeared after 2000 did not have founders named Zhou. For example, the founders of Zhou Jinsheng are surnamed Li, the founders of Zhou Baifu are surnamed Ye, and the founders of Zhou Fusheng are surnamed Zheng... The founders of these brands must be well aware of whether there is a motive for &quot;taking advantage of&quot; the brand. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The rush to surname &quot;Zhou&quot; reflects a dilemma of domestic jewelry brands: There is still a lack of domestic jewelry brands that are truly out of the circle, and consumers fail to understand some of the problems. Some brands generate real loyalty. Gold banks look similar, and consumers don’t care that much. This gives those who “fake” the brand an opportunity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/23/3q8lLZ1kdijbLfTD5NOyZfbGST9i21Ndx4qJPKzJ.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/23/3q8lLZ1kdijbLfTD5NOyZfbGST9i21Ndx4qJPKzJ.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;259329&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; >;&lt;strong>;Seize for the sinking market&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Not only are they competing for the surname &quot;Zhou&quot;, China&#39;s major gold banks are also competing for the market. This time, the employees of Zhou Taisheng and Lao Fengxiang fought over soliciting business, which is a microcosm of the current situation of jewelry brands competing for the sinking market. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Whether it is Lao Fengxiang, China Gold, or a group of gold banks named &quot;Zhou&quot;, they have opened stores in the sinking market. Some netizens posted that their hometown is a small county, but “seven or eight gold stores have opened on one street.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Chow Tai Fook&#39;s first quarter financial report of this year shows that in the first quarter, Chow Tai Fook opened 248 new retail points in the mainland. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Chow Tai Sang&#39;s financial report shows that as of the first quarter of 2023, the number of Chow Tai Sang&#39;s terminal stores has increased by a net of 133 stores compared with the end of the same period last year, and by a net increase of 21 stores from the beginning of the year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;China Gold&#39;s 2023 first quarter financial report shows that China Gold added 21 direct-operated stores and 325 franchise stores in the first quarter; Chow Sang Sang also predicted in the financial report , the group will have a net increase of approximately 100 branches in 2023. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Most of these branches are in third- and fourth-tier cities. For example, in 2022, more than half of Chow Tai Fook&#39;s new stores will be located in sinking markets, and the proportion of retail value in third-tier, fourth-tier and other cities has reached one-third. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The reason why we target the sinking market is that on the one hand, the gold and jewelry market in first- and second-tier cities has gradually become saturated, and there is no shortage of gold banks and gold stores. Expand market share and begin to extend to lower-tier markets. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On the other hand, in addition to investment and self-wear, a very critical part of the consumer demand for jewelry is wedding demand. In small counties, there are customary requirements for &quot;three golds&quot; (gold necklaces, gold rings, gold earrings) or &quot;hardwares&quot; (gold bracelets and gold headdresses are added to the &quot;three golds&quot;) for weddings. Gold consumption of 10,000 yuan is &quot;standard&quot; in many places. This is a big cake. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;However, the sinking of gold brands has also brought new problems. The first thing to bear the brunt is brand management. Many new stores are franchise stores of the brand. The management level of the franchisees varies. Once a problem occurs, it becomes a brand problem and has an impact on the brand image. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;What is even more embarrassing is that for consumers in the sinking market, whether you are the senior Lao Fengxiang, Chow Tai Fook, the much younger Chow Tai Seng, or the local There is no fundamental difference between some &quot;no-name&quot; gold banks. Consumers &quot;buy whichever one is cheaper&quot;. Anyway, they are all gold, so whoever you buy is not buying. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Therefore, the &quot;business war&quot; of gold banks in the sinking market sometimes involves simply and crudely grabbing customers, which may lead to conflicts. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Need to work hard on craftsmanship and brand management&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;No matter Whether they are competing for the surname &quot;Zhou&quot; or the outrageous conflicts caused by low-quality competition, they have jointly exposed the common dilemma of domestic gold brands: the brand premium is not high, consumers&#39; brand loyalty is not high, and competition is still in the &quot;reckless&quot; stage. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Precisely because the brand premium is not high, the profit margins of domestic gold brands are not high. No matter how the gold price outside rises, buying gold at a gold bank only adds a labor fee to the gold price. According to industry analysis, the retail gross profit margin of gold is 10%-20%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;As for profit margins, they are even lower. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;For example, Lao Fengxiang&#39;s first quarter financial report for 2023 shows that during the reporting period, the company achieved total operating income of 24.558 billion yuan, net profit attributable to the parent company of 716 million yuan, and a profit margin of 2.9%; China Gold’s operating income in the first quarter of 2023 was 16.139 billion yuan, net profit attributable to the parent company was 300 million yuan, and the profit margin was 1.86%...&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In comparison , some foreign luxury jewelry brands, such as Tiffany, Bulgari, and Van Cleef &amp; Arpels, have enviable retail gross profit margins, which can reach 50%-60%. The materials used are obviously ordinary materials that are cheaper than gold, but the price is eye-popping, and consumers still flock to it. Labeling consumers as &quot;foolish people with too much money&quot; is just the self-comfort of those who are lagging behind. Domestic gold brands need to face the gap head-on. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Where do these luxury brands “win”? On the one hand, luxury brand craftsmanship and innovation have elements of originality and originality. For example, Van Cleef &amp; Arpels&#39; &quot;Four-Leaf Clover&quot; series has become a hit because of its classics. Domestic gold brands have also been exploring craftsmanship in recent years. For example, Chow Tai Fook&#39;s &quot;ancient gold&quot; is very popular among young consumers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Unfortunately, following the trend in China is still too serious. Nowadays, almost every mainstream gold brand has an ancient gold series, and the distinction between brands is even worse. Disappeared. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The other is the continuous cultivation of brand image. Nowadays, many gold brands co-brand with brands that young people like, such as Harry Potter and Zootopia. This is of course one way, but the co-branding itself relies more on the power of other brands and cannot be converted into the value of its own brand. . Consumers will buy co-branded models, but they will not become loyal users of gold brands. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In the final analysis, to enhance brand power, we must avoid short-sightedness, avoid eagerness for quick success, avoid following the trend, be calm, sit back, and work hard on craftsmanship. Enhance the artistry and sense of nobility of the brand, making it difficult for other brands to copy it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Otherwise, if you blindly follow the trend, blindly expand the market and open franchises, it may seem that you have a large market share, but in fact, you will still earn money through hard work. fee. In the end, no matter how fierce the &quot;fight&quot; is, consumers will still buy the cheaper one - and your &quot;fight&quot; is in vain. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 23 Nov 2023 14:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[儿童医院人满为患，国家卫健委回应]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261135]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-23 13:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;In view of the recent increase in the number of outpatient and emergency visits in hospitals and the increase in the number of children infected with respiratory diseases in some places, the National Health Commission In an exclusive interview with Xinhua News Agency on November 23, the relevant responsible comrades of the Health Committee answered some questions that the public, especially families of children, are concerned about. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Question:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Recently, many local children’s hospitals have been overcrowded, and the National Health Commission has taken measures What measures are in place to provide relief? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Answer:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Recently, we have continued to pay attention to the diagnosis and treatment of vulnerable groups in children during the period of high incidence of infectious diseases, and guided all localities to strengthen overall planning and implement hierarchical diagnosis and treatment. system. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Question:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Some community hospitals have recently opened examinations for children services, but some parents are worried that community hospitals have insufficient diagnostic and treatment capabilities and may delay their children’s condition.

After looking at the collection of the library, I couldn’t help but wonder, just for the Chinese local chronicles, which library in China has so many original local chronicles from the early Qing Dynasty, where you can read them by hand, take photos for free, and each set of rare books has been specially protected. Protected and carefully collected, this is just the tip of the iceberg of Harvard&#39;s many libraries. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Professor Zhao Kui said that some of Harvard University’s chronicles were purchased by Yenching University when it was running a school in China in the late Qing Dynasty and the Republic of China, some were purchased from Japanese collectors after Japan’s defeat, and many were purchased by Chinese collectors. The income is directly donated by the family, which is the accumulated income of hundreds of years and generations of research. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Regardless of the amount of information, Harvard University’s openness is worth promoting in China. Foreigners who intend to visit the Harvard University Library can enter the library with valid documents after applying for a visit. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In China&#39;s relevant laws and policies, public libraries must be open to the public free of charge. However, school libraries do not have this obligation. In 2017, the second draft of the Public Library Law was reviewed, and Article 47 stipulated: “The state encourages school libraries, libraries of scientific research institutions, and other types of libraries to be open to the public.” Article 48 of the Public Library Law that was finally implemented stipulates: &quot;The state supports school libraries, scientific research institution libraries and other types of libraries to be open to the public.&quot; From encouragement to support, opening school libraries to the public On the issue of openness, the attitude has become weaker. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some people believe that libraries in universities and scientific research institutions serve specific teachers and students, and students also pay fees to go to university. Therefore, libraries in universities and scientific research institutions should put the interests of teachers and students first. In the first place, there is no obligation to the public. From the perspective of resources and capabilities, school libraries have limited space. Now many university libraries are overcrowded and it is difficult to find a library. University libraries are unable to assume the responsibility of opening to the outside world. Opening up to the outside world will worsen the experience of teachers and students in schools. After it is opened to the outside world, even if there is access through ID cards, citizen cards, etc., it cannot be strictly managed like subway security inspections. There are great dangers and hidden dangers, which is not conducive to protecting students. In addition, there will be management issues, such as the problem of non-return after lending. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Actually, these reasons are not valid. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First of all, although students pay tuition fees, the running costs of the university cannot be covered by tuition fees. China&#39;s universities and scientific research institutions are all supported by state funding, including libraries, and state funding comes from taxes paid by each citizen. University libraries are also public libraries to some extent. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The public&#39;s demand for the library is mainly for borrowing, which will not put too much pressure on the venue. In terms of management, the credit system is now very developed and can fully undertake the management of university libraries opening to the outside world. In addition to ID cards, citizen cards, and financial credit systems, social credit systems such as Zhima Fen are now very efficient. Not only can you borrow power banks and shared bicycles without a deposit, you can even rent a car without a deposit. These values ​​are more expensive than books. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for security issues, borrowing itself is a screening demand. Those who have this demand are people with some education. Even if it is open, it will not be like a teahouse or bar, and the demand will not skyrocket and the pressure will not be Not big. Of course, there are always more risks when there are more people, but this risk is no higher than college students taking the subway or walking on the street, so the so-called safety issues are not valid. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, there is another very important reason why universities and research institutions do not open their libraries, that is, they can monopolize scarce information and academic resources, thereby gaining advantages in publishing papers and producing results. But obviously, academic libraries supported by public finance should not become exclusive academic resources. Someone said on Weibo that he went to the National Library and wanted to read the only copy of &quot;The Book of Fishing&quot; from the Ming Dynasty. He only saw it after asking for help. He was not allowed to take pictures. It took him three days to enter it on the computer and spent more than 500 yuan on the remaining part. Copying, and you also need to sign a &quot;no publication&quot; guarantee before you can read it. The original copies of the Ming Dynasty have long lost their copyright. The library should be responsible for disseminating knowledge, but it regards this as an exclusive resource. This phenomenon is more serious in universities and research institutions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The libraries of universities and research institutions are more professional than public libraries and have more comprehensive subject materials. If they are only used by one family, it will cause waste. If they are open to the public, they can exert greater value and make more people use it. Many people benefit, and it is also conducive to academic competition and innovation. On the other hand, university libraries are independent, which will lead to duplication of construction and is not conducive to the efficient use of resources. Opening up university libraries and sharing resources is conducive to the differentiation of university libraries into professional directions, which is also a good thing for universities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Good Will Hunting&quot;, which was nominated for Best Picture at the 70th Academy Awards together with &quot;Titanic&quot;, tells the story of the growth of a talented boy. In the film, a Harvard college student laughs at the male protagonist, and the male protagonist counterattacks: &quot;The education you spent fifteen thousand dollars on, I can get in a public library for only one and a half dollars.&quot; Open libraries are conducive to education. Fairness and fair opportunities allow more people who have not entered universities or scientific research institutions to easily obtain academic materials and promote the development of China&#39;s science, technology, and cultural knowledge. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In March 2017, the Ministry of Education and the General Administration of Sports jointly issued the &quot;Implementation Opinions on Promoting the Opening of School Sports Venues to the Society&quot;, which aims to effectively alleviate the growing sports and fitness needs of young people and the general public. The contradiction between sports venues and insufficient supply of resources promotes the prosperity and development of national fitness. Objectively speaking, the operation of sports venues is a zero-sum game with little flexibility and an either-or for users. But the library is different. If it is just for borrowing, opening it to the public will have little impact on students and researchers. Therefore, since university stadiums can &quot;promote opening to the public&quot;, then there is no reason for university libraries to be closed and refused to be open to the public. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The library is a public service with strong externalities. It can popularize knowledge, help innovation, and drive the country&#39;s technological and economic progress and social development. The more borrowings there are, the stronger the role of the library. It is a great thing for the country and individuals for libraries to operate at a higher intensity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Therefore, the state should promote, encourage and even require libraries in universities and research institutions to be open to the public. Nowadays, libraries have a lot of electronic materials, which are open to the public. They do not occupy library space and do not put a lot of pressure on the network. Electronic materials in colleges and universities are open to the public, and this can be done immediately. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 23 Nov 2023 12:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[这对错置的父女，治愈又温情]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261059]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-23 11:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data-mpa-powered-by=&quot;yiban.io&quot;>;&lt;span>;There is a new movie recently.

He is the one who needs to be taken care of. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This contrary narration method makes the film full of a childishness that pretends to be mature. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/22/f150d9df5aa87d07e290d3bffcacb8f1.gif&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;264&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/22/f150d9df5aa87d07e290d3bffcacb8f1.gif&quot; data-key=&quot;259125&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In our traditional understanding, fathers are often figures of silent giving. For example, in Zhu Ziqing&#39;s novel, the father left a deep shadow after turning over the tracks to buy oranges for his son; for example, the father played by Zhang Yi in the currently released &quot;Priceless Treasure&quot; is very willing to protect and pay for his adopted daughter, even if he faces jail, he still has to protect his daughter&#39;s safety. . &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;A father from this perspective is always like a mountain, extending his hands when his children need them, and becoming a beacon when their children move forward. Likewise, as children, they should also go Understand their hardship and be grateful for their efforts. &lt;/span>;This is a profound expression of father&#39;s love, and also contains a spiritual expectation of parents for their children, hoping that they will be considerate and filial in return. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;However, &quot;Occasional Echoes&quot; misplaced the maturity of the little girl and her father in an exaggerated way, causing the father to confess that he was not sensible and did not know how to take care of him as soon as he appeared. child. The daughter, on the other hand, cleans the house the way her mother did when she was alive, so that every place in the house always looks like it did when her mother was alive. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In this contrary misplacement, the movie&lt;/span>; rarely restores the world of a child. There is the joy that only belongs to children here. She dances cutely downstairs to please the neighbors, rolls around on the grass with her friends, thinks she can steal other people&#39;s bicycles seamlessly, and thinks she is confident in bargaining with unscrupulous car dealers. This is a child who forces himself to mature and begins to explore the grand world, full of vitality. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, the film generously acknowledges that our parents can also be outrageous. For example, he would join his daughter&#39;s theft, not only to help her look out, but also to start the operation.

The film not only captures the panic and anxiety of children trying to grow into adults, but also captures the panic and fear of men becoming fathers. They are limited to their first time. The father must learn to accompany and the daughter must learn to accept. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Towards the end of the movie, there is a plot that makes people laugh out loud - the little girl&lt;/span>; heard her mother leaving a &lt;span>;message&lt; to her father on the phone&lt; /span>; &quot;Take good care of your daughter&quot;, but in a blink of an eye she found that her father was not in the house. She searched in panic, and finally heard the boy playing football calling &quot;Jason&quot; next to a football field on the corner of the street.

Selling tofu bread in a bun shop may indeed violate the regulations, but it does not necessarily require a huge penalty. Is there a more humane way? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the China Quality News Network, a subsidiary of China Quality Newspaper and Periodicals, which is in charge of the State Administration of Municipal Supervision, an administrative penalty published on the official website of the Beijing Municipal Supervision Bureau recently showed that the &quot;Beijing Wannan Wenxin Baozi Shop&quot; will be closed in 2022. From April 23 to July 27, 2023, &quot;1,169 orders of tofu nao (salty) were sold on a food delivery platform, priced at 6 yuan/order, with a value of 7,014 yuan.&quot; The Chaoyang District Municipal Supervision Bureau believes that the bun shop sells hot food beyond the scope of its licensed business items and violates Article 16, paragraph 1, of the Measures for the Investigation and Punishment of Illegal Activities on Online Food Safety and the Measures for the Supervision and Administration of Food Safety in Online Catering Services 》Article 4 stipulates that he shall be fined 15,000 yuan according to law; his illegal income of 7,014 yuan shall be confiscated. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is undoubtedly surprising that the bun shop cannot sell tofu pudding. As a result, the penalty quickly attracted a lot of attention on social media. Many netizens made fun of it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The clause quoted in the administrative penalty decision stipulates that food operators shall not operate beyond the scope of the food business license. But why is it beyond the business scope of a bun shop to sell tofu? This really leaves a lot of people scratching their heads. According to the Chaoyang District Municipal Supervision Bureau, selling tofu curd is exceeding the permitted scope of selling hot food, but aren’t steamed buns a hot food? Since you can sell steamed buns, it means you have a hot food business license, so why can&#39;t you sell tofu puffs? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The public administrative penalty information does not provide any further explanation. Then we can only look up more information. Judging from the industrial and commercial registration information, the business license of this bun shop was registered in 2018, and its business scope includes catering services and food sales. According to the Food Safety Law, food-related business activities require a food business license. Then I checked its food business license information and found that its licensed business item is &quot;manufacture and sales of hot food (limited to staple food products)&quot;. The &quot;restricted to staple food products&quot; in the brackets is probably the reason why this bun shop was fined. Although they are all hot foods, steamed buns are a staple food, so their production and sale are allowed, while tofu curd is not considered a staple food, so they cannot be sold. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From this point of view, the punishment imposed by the Chaoyang Municipal Supervision Bureau cannot be said to be illegal. However, its rationality is still questionable. First of all, why is the scope of the food business license of this bun shop so narrow? According to the &quot;Food Business License Management Measures&quot; formulated by the former State Food and Drug Administration, the food business license items applied for by catering service operators are divided into hot food production and sales, cold food food production and sales, raw food food production and sales, and cakes. Production and sales of food, homemade drinks and other types of food. Except for the specific varieties approved by the Food and Drug Administration, which should be clearly marked for the production and sale of other types of food, other categories do not need to be specially labeled. So why is the food business license of this bun shop marked as limited to staple food products? If regulations do not stipulate that different business licenses apply to staple food and non-staple hot food, is the license originally issued by the Chaoyang Municipal Supervision Bureau suspected of not being administered in accordance with the law and improperly restricting the business scope of the business? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It should be noted that information from the official website of the Beijing Municipal Supervision Bureau shows that the food business license of Wannan Wenxin Baozi Shop was issued on October 17, 2023. The penalty decision for operating beyond the scope was made on November 13. The illegal facts in the penalty decision show that Baozipu has been selling tofu nao on the takeout website since April 2022. So, when this bun shop applied for a food business license in 2023, why did it only apply for the production and sale of &quot;staple food&quot; hot foods? Knowing that in addition to steamed buns, their store also sells tofu puffs, and that there is no need to apply separately for hot food business licenses for staple food and non-staple food, the store deliberately only applied for a manufacturing and sales license for &quot;staple food&quot; to limit its business scope and Excluding the tofu pudding that you are already selling, are you digging a hole for yourself? Were you misled when you applied for a food business license? Have the staff of the competent department fulfilled their duty of explanation? Is it even possible that when applying for a license, they deliberately misled them to only apply for a staple food license, and then investigated and punished them for selling non-staple food beyond the scope? Considering that he was investigated and fined less than a month after applying for the license, such a timing coincidence can easily lead to other suspicions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Even if there are no problems with the above process, imposing such a heavy penalty violates the basic principle of administrative punishment that the penalty should be commensurate with the offense. The Administrative Penalty Law clearly stipulates that if the violation is minor and corrected in a timely manner without causing harmful consequences, administrative penalties will not be imposed. Baozi and tofu are both hot foods, and regulations do not make any special distinction between the safety supervision of the two. The sale of tofu in the bun shop has not caused any food safety consequences. Even if there is any violation of law, the circumstances are very minor, and it can be given a warning and ordered to make corrections. At the beginning, more than 7,000 &quot;illegal gains&quot; were confiscated and fined 15,000 yuan. A total of more than 20,000 yuan. How long does it take for a bun shop to make money back? At a time when it is difficult to make a living in a small business, imposing such heavy penalties on small businessmen will of course arouse strong dissatisfaction among the public. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is not uncommon for small mistakes to be punished heavily. In 2021, a vegetable shop owner in Yulin, Shaanxi Province was fined 66,000 yuan by the market supervision department for selling 5 kilograms of substandard celery. After being exposed by the State Council Supervision Bureau, the deputy director of the city&#39;s Municipal Supervision Bureau admitted that the punishment was too severe and was not proportionate. A CCTV report found that among the more than 50 penalties imposed on small and micro market entities by the city&#39;s Municipal Supervision Bureau since 2021, 21 cases were fined more than 50,000 yuan, and the case value was only tens or hundreds of yuan. The Chaoyang Municipal Supervision Bureau in Beijing imposed a heavy fine on Baozi Shop, which is comparable to the case in Yulin. Is this kind of supervision for supervision or for fines? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Food safety supervision is of course very important, but supervision cannot be for the sake of supervision, let alone supervision for the sake of fines. Under the current economic situation, providing good services to small and micro market entities and creating a good market environment should be the primary responsibility of regulatory authorities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 23 Nov 2023 10:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[“阿根廷特朗普”米莱：他承诺去做的和他将会去做的]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261100]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-23 09:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 11/22/VYQXzpdI0T4ZMuFEFaFT7g8Rc2qZzVWbsN7BPZzu.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/22/VYQXzpdI0T4ZMuFEFaFT7g8Rc2qZzV WbsN7BPZzu. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;259316&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On November 19, 2023, the candidate of the Argentine far-right electoral alliance &quot;Freedom Forward Party&quot; Milai greeted the people at a polling station in the capital Buenos Aires &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Xinhua News Agency/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Local On October 22, the results of the second round of the Argentine presidential election were announced.

Since 2017, he has become interested in politics. In 2021, he founded the far-right political party &quot;Avanza Libertad&quot; (Avanza Libertad) and was successfully elected to the House of Representatives as the party&#39;s candidate. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2023, he announced his participation in the presidential election. Initially, because he was a &quot;rookie&quot; in politics and his political party was very weak, he was generally considered to be a &quot;student with the prince&quot;, and even got the nickname &quot;El Loco&quot; ) nickname. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But the primary election on August 13 (a unique electoral stage in Argentina. Due to the large number of small parties in Congress, several larger party alliances must be formed, and each alliance recommends a single presidential candidate. The purpose of the primary election (the single candidate for the election of each coalition), Millais not only stood out from the &quot;Juntos por el Cambio&quot; coalition composed of 12 right-wing parties, becoming the only candidate of the coalition, but also passed all 5 Among the candidates in the primary election, he topped the list with 30% of the vote and became the most popular candidate in the election overnight. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the first round of voting on October 22, Milais received 29.99% of the votes, second only to Massa (36.78%). Due to Argentina’s election rules, the person elected as president needs to obtain a majority. In the second round of voting on November 19, Millay won with an absolute advantage of 55.7% to 44.3%, and won 21 of Argentina&#39;s 24 provinces. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Why was the &quot;madman&quot; elected?&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Argentina&#39;s annual inflation rate has reached 140%, and may even exceed 200% by the end of the year. More than 40% of the population lives below the poverty line. In the past 20 years, It has defaulted on its international sovereign debt three times in the past few years, and the latest time it even caused neighboring Bolivia and Brazil to refuse to deliver the pineapples and bananas they ordered as part of the contract to avoid defaulting on their debts. Argentina, nicknamed &quot;the only developed country to develop into a developing country in modern times&quot;, ranked sixth in the world in terms of economic aggregate at the beginning of the 20th century, but has now fallen to 66th. Argentines have long complained about this. Not only that, massive public expenditures, deteriorating social security, and the prevalence of nepotism known as &quot;political casteization&quot; have become the targets of public outrage. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It was against this background that Milais, who appeared with an alternative image of &quot;wild hair and a big mouth&quot;, entered the political arena as an &quot;amateur internet celebrity gunner&quot; and shouted out a series of remarks that seemed shocking but were actually The alternative political platform of &quot;Directed Demolition&quot;: Abolish the central bank and the local currency and switch to the US dollar, which is intended to cater to the public&#39;s distrust of the local currency and central bank accumulated due to long-term inflation and local currency establishment, and the public&#39;s belief that &quot;strong medicine may be able to eradicate inflation and &quot;Wealth shrinkage&quot; is expected; the abolition of more than half of the ministries and commissions is intended to cater to public dissatisfaction with nepotism and bureaucracy; the withdrawal from the &quot;BRIC&quot;, the freeze of large-scale engineering projects, and the privatization of public service enterprises and educational institutions such as schools, radio and television facilities, and electricity ization is intended to cater to the public’s strong desire to reduce public expenditures. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for other &quot;alternative propositions&quot;, they are mostly put forward to highlight their &quot;core values&quot; or attract core supporters, such as advocating anti-abortion and anti-contraception, opposing energy conservation and emission reduction, and drastically cutting social welfare and Medical privatization, etc., are all in line with its &quot;basic color&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At one point, he also proposed that &quot;everyone has a gun&quot; and even allowed his die-hard supporters to insult the current Pope Francis, who is also an Argentinian. This was also his &quot;true performance.&quot; As for the drug liberalization policy, which is very different from the &quot;Trump replicas&quot; of most other countries, it was &quot;condescendingly&quot; proposed to cater to the tastes of some low-level people in Argentina. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Most analysts point out that although the majority of the Argentine public may not really believe that Millais can &quot;cure all diseases&quot;, given the negative impact of left-wing Peronism in the past Having won 10 out of 13 general elections, the left wing has already overdrafted the trust and patience of voters, while the traditional right wing has failed to reverse the situation in the last two elections. Therefore, &quot;since other methods don&#39;t work, we might as well try strong medicine.&quot; This kind of &quot;maybe it might work&quot; thinking quickly became popular, and allowed Millay, who had participated in a &quot;copycat&quot; Rolling Stones band and was familiar with the way of pop success, to win the presidency. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some analysts pointed out that after Millais suddenly emerged in the primary election, the government used a propaganda machine to &quot;demonize&quot; him in a panic, which was counterproductive. Some works intended to arouse public panic about Milley&#39;s administration (such as claiming that Milley&#39;s public spending cuts will cause the Buenos Aires metro ticket to rise to 1,100 pesos, while the current price is only 56 pesos) have actually done the government a disservice because The public can easily associate this with the soaring prices, and be led away by Milley&#39;s propaganda that &quot;the government spends money indiscriminately like this.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some local observers pointed out that Millais carefully created the image of a &quot;political outsider&quot; and successfully attracted a large number of grassroots votes under the banner of &quot;understanding the sufferings of the people&quot; and &quot;opposing nepotism&quot;, but his The image of &quot;grassroots spokesperson&quot; is carefully created by a group of the richest people in Argentina: billionaire Eduardo Eurnekian is one of Millay&#39;s most important supporters, and the media network &quot;A24&quot; he controls is Millay&#39;s The main shaper and promoter of successful political public relations images, and successfully &quot;killed&quot; the mediocre public media in a series of dazzling combinations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The right-wing’s decisive choice after the first round is a tactical key: Patricia Bullrich, also a far-right but “relatively less right” candidate, won the primary election as “ The slogan &quot;Anti-high crime rate&quot; competed with Millais&#39;s snipe and clam, and won 23.81% of the votes in the first round, ranking third after Massa and Millais. After the first round, Milley decisively stopped his criticism of Burridge, who quickly announced his support for Milley after weighing the pros and cons. In fact, Milley&#39;s vote share in the second round (55.7%) was the same as in the first round. The combined votes of Millais and Burridge (53.90%) were about the same. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/22/cdRisNIh3HwbGLwcb0IvcmMiztRxeqzryQU7RPLV.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/22/cdRisNIh3HwbGLwcb0IvcmMiztRxeqzryQU7RPLV.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;259318&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On November 19, 2023, Massa, candidate of Argentina&#39;s center-left ruling coalition Fatherland, gave a speech after voting at a polling station in Tigre, Buenos Aires Province. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Xinhua News Agency/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Civil and military officials and the &quot;prime minister in black&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Because of the political party to which Milai belongs It is too small and the core team is not large.

This celebrity who is well-versed in &quot;Internet celebrity economics&quot; is in the election campaign In the process, he came up with many clever ideas for Mi Lai. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;His vice-presidential partner Victoria Villarruel is a controversial figure: she has a high profile and considerable appeal in the right-wing camp, but because she was born in the former military government He comes from a family of military officials, and has been controversial for his public advocacy of &quot;rehabilitating&quot; important members of the military government. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for the &quot;prime minister in black&quot; who does not hold public office, but may have a significant impact on the new government&#39;s strategy and policy direction, in addition to the aforementioned billionaire Ernekian and others, he calls him Sister Karina Milei, who is known as &quot;My Moses&quot; and is called &quot;the one who has the greatest influence on Milei&quot; by insiders, is also a figure that cannot be ignored. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Promises that will be fulfilled, will not be fulfilled and may not be fulfilled&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&quot;Stay away from the &#39;BRIC&#39;&quot;, cut public spending and freeze large projects, it seems that Milai will come to power at present campaign promises that will definitely be fulfilled in the future, because these promises have a broader voter base and are interlocking (for example, the former government actively sought to join the &quot;BRICS&quot; in order to launch more large-scale project financing), which is also the reason for the left-wing and former government core platform and least popular policies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Privatizing public media&quot; will also be launched as soon as possible, not only because too many public officials are the focus of social dissatisfaction (Millay once slammed &quot;6.2 million people in the private sector&quot; on a radio show Argentinian employees working in companies have to support 20 million public servants&quot;, which won a round of applause), and also because of the &quot;witch-hunting frenzy&quot; and &quot;targeted smear campaign&quot; against Milley after the primary election, fearing that Milley would lose his job if he came to power. Public media employees were in high spirits. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/22/ve41ebVCsbEYGL3fC3aemeeKyqzo5G3aO3NoKHhh.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/22/ve41ebVCsbEYGL3fC3aemeeKyqzo5G3aO3NoKHhh.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;259315&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On November 16, 2023, in Cordoba, Argentina, Milai (middle), candidate of the far-right electoral alliance &quot;Freedom Forward Party&quot;, attended a campaign rally&lt;span style=&quot; color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Xinhua News Agency/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some campaign promises will be fulfilled, but most of them will be &quot;discounted&quot;: ministries and commissions will definitely be reduced, but it is not expected to be as previously announced Shutting down more than half of the ministries and central banks is not only overkill, but as a smaller ruling party, it is also not conducive to arranging the personnel of allies based on merit; the &quot;alienation&quot; of countries such as Brazil and China will continue, but it will not go too far: Chapter 2 Before the second round of voting, he had low-key stated that he &quot;will abide by the contracts he has signed with Chinese companies.&quot; Many analysts pointed out that his &quot;National Olympics&quot; economic and financial strategy relies heavily on overseas financing. However, in the United States, whether the Democratic or Republican Party is in charge, (Interestingly, Trump, whom Milai admired and congratulated on his election, was an American politician who openly opposed continuing to provide financing facilities to Argentina). It was a mess. Relations with China, an important source of international investment, may not be of any benefit to Argentina. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, he once publicly threatened to visit the United States and Israel as soon as possible after being elected, and pay homage to many Jewish leaders (he once declared that he would convert to Judaism), but he has obviously lowered his tone recently because of the latest democratic reforms. Polls show that mainstream public opinion in Argentina is very interested in the U.S. dollar, but has little interest in having the country get too close to Israel, especially in having its president &quot;Judaized.&quot; Therefore, the visit is likely to take place, but it is not expected to be &quot;excessive.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Promises that are almost certain to be unfulfilled include bashing the Pope (apologized before the second round of voting), &quot;guns for all&quot; (publicly abandoned after the first round of voting due to reverse polls), privatization of health care decentralization and large-scale cuts in public welfare (which has been significantly retracted after the strong reversal in the polls), as well as &quot;ceding the Falklands to the United Kingdom&quot; - most allies in his campaign coalition are openly opposed to it, and his vice presidential candidate Villarreal endorses it. Several Falklands War veteran organizations reacted fiercely to this, and public opinion feedback was not ideal. He has rarely mentioned it recently. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It remains to be seen whether or to what extent some of the promises are fulfilled, the most prominent being &quot;abandoning the local currency and switching to the U.S. dollar.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some analysts believe that given that Argentina’s local currency has long been discredited at home and abroad, and that Argentine companies and ordinary people have actually begun to switch to the U.S. dollar, the resistance to “currency dollarization” is not as great as imagined. , coupled with public complaints about &quot;the government creating inflation and poverty through money printing,&quot; this move is also expected to gain popularity in a short period of time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But most analysts, such as William Jackson, chief emerging markets economist at Capital Economics and Thierry Larose, portfolio manager at Vontobel Asset Management in Zurich, believe that the situation is It’s not that simple: Argentina is the third largest economy in Latin America. Giving up its local currency and switching to the U.S. dollar means giving up control of its own fiscal and financial policies, “financial colonization” of the country, and letting the Federal Reserve control the lifeline of Argentina’s economy. Once the economic situation is further affected, Due to setbacks, public sentiment can easily reverse in the Latin American environment, thus putting the initiator of this policy into a desperate situation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Not only that, because Argentina’s international credit rating is so bad, it is still unknown whether the Federal Reserve, which has tended to “America first” in recent years, is willing to accept the offer. They also pointed out that &quot;currency dollarization&quot; may be able to control inflation, but it cannot solve Argentina&#39;s financial difficulties, and the latter is the root of Argentina&#39;s economic and financial difficulties. In fact, in his victory speech, Milley did avoid slogans such as &quot;dollarization of currency&quot; and &quot;closing the central bank&quot; that he had repeatedly shouted before. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is also unknown whether the privatization of public services and large state-owned enterprises will be fully implemented, because refusing to fulfill promises will certainly offend many voters and continue to bear a heavy financial burden, but complete &quot;smashing&quot; will definitely cause In the violent social turmoil, it is difficult to decide how to choose. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is recognized that there are two things that are not among the campaign promises but will definitely be done:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The first is to try international debt restructuring again. The reason why it will be done is because it is impossible not to do it. The reason why they did not make a big deal out of it is because the left wingers were doing the same thing when they were in power;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The second is to carry out legal liquidation of dignitaries of the current government after taking office, such as the first lady and vice president who were criticized by the public. Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner is likely to be taken to court or even sent to prison after leaving office. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many analysts believe that given that Milley’s party only accounts for 10% of the seats in the Argentine Senate and only 5% of the seats in the House of Representatives, the Alliance for Common Change is still a minority in parliament, and Milais is still a minority in parliament. Lai himself is also very inactive in parliament (it is said that he only participated in co-signing one law draft during his tenure as a member), and many of his too radical and controversial campaign promises will face varying degrees of &quot;discounting and dumping&quot; in the future. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 23 Nov 2023 09:25:05 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[融创完成900亿元债务重组，保交楼压力仍在]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261096]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-23 08:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;A real estate project in Sunac Beijing.

Visual China/Picture&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After 18 months, Sunac China (01918.HK) fully resolved the debt risk of approximately 90 billion yuan, and completed all domestic and overseas debt restructuring. The real estate industry ushered in the first large-scale real estate company to complete debt restructuring. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On November 20, 2023, Sunac issued an announcement announcing that all conditions for overseas debt restructuring had been met and it officially took effect on that day. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the announcement, creditors’ existing debt of approximately US$10 billion will be replaced with new notes, mandatory convertible bonds, convertible bonds, and shares of Sunac Services (01516.HK) at a consideration of 57 respectively. US$1 billion, US$2.75 billion, US$1 billion, US$775 million. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among them, three products: new notes, mandatory convertible bonds, and convertible bonds are expected to be listed on the SGX on November 21; Sunac Services shares have been transferred to the account of the plan creditors. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since the second half of 2021, more than 50 listed real estate companies have initiated debt restructuring. In May 2022, Sunac defaulted on its debt and completed domestic debt restructuring at the end of that year. &quot;In the next stage, the company&#39;s focus will be on the Baojiao Building.&quot; A Sunac insider told a reporter from Southern Weekend. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“Sunac can still be saved”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Information provided by the above-mentioned insiders shows that after the restructuring of Sunac’s overseas debt, it has reduced its debt by approximately US$4.5 billion (over 30 billion yuan) scale, the annual debt repayment pressure has dropped by nearly 2.5 billion yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the debt restructuring, Sunac’s first extended note matures in September 2025. At the same time, the company has the right to extend it for one year. After the extension, it will mature in September 2026, providing the company with Breathing window in the past 3 years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, the company can choose to pay interest in kind in the first two years. In the first year, the interest can be fully capitalized. In the second year, the company can choose to support only 2% cash interest (the remaining part of the interest is capitalized), which reduces The company’s overseas cash repayment pressure within two years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The above-mentioned insiders said that the restructuring plan won the support of more than 98% of the creditor&#39;s rights and more than 99% of the creditors at the creditors&#39; meeting in September 2023. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xie Yifeng, president of the China Urban Real Estate Research Institute, analyzed to Southern Weekend reporters that the debt conversion of real estate enterprises usually requires the help of third parties, such as the intervention of financial institutions, central state-owned enterprises, overseas capital, etc., and the pledge of equity, land, etc. , protecting the principal and interest income of creditors. This way you can get an extension and avoid liquidation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the overseas debt restructuring telephone briefing on March 29, 2023, Sunac Executive Director and CEO Wang Mengde introduced that some loan extension projects are actively seeking support from banks and other financial institutions, and introducing AMC ( Asset management companies) and other third-party funds solve difficult-to-extend financing such as trusts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to Sunac’s official WeChat account, six banks led by Shanghai Pudong Development Bank, China Huarong (02799.HK), and CITIC Trust jointly injected capital into Sunac’s Shanghai Dongjiadu project, with a scale of over 12 billion yuan, the first Funding will be completed in January 2023. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The above-mentioned insiders said that since 2022, Sunac has received a total of 19 billion yuan in bailout funds, and has carried out extensive cooperation with AMC, obtaining more than 20 billion yuan in new financing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xie Yifeng believes that Sunac&#39;s successful debt restructuring reflects the fact that creditors and third-party institutions believe that &quot;Sunac can still be saved&quot; after evaluating its assets and debt situation. Confidence in the real estate market. Compared with other explosive real estate companies, Sunac&#39;s debt scale is relatively small and its asset quality is higher. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But in his view, Sunac’s debt restructuring has limited reference significance for other real estate companies. Since the assets and liabilities of each real estate company are different, it needs to be evaluated on a &quot;one house, one policy&quot; basis. For example, Country Garden (02007.HK), Sino-Ocean Group (03377.HK), Gemdale Group (600383.SH) and other real estate companies that are also facing debt pressure have failed to apply for extension. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The annual guaranteed delivery target is 300,000 units&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;It is worth noting that the completion of debt restructuring only means that Sunac has eliminated short-term debt risks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But after the window period ends, Sunac still faces challenges. &quot;As long as the real estate market does not recover and the company does not receive payment from sales, there may be a default on debts such as commercial bills,&quot; Xie Yifeng said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He explained that Sunac is currently only extending domestic and overseas bank loans, bonds, etc., but the scale of commercial bills to pay for the project is still large. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sunac’s 2023 interim report shows that as of June 30, 2023, the company’s trade and other payables were 274.1 billion yuan, and contract liabilities were 292.6 billion yuan. This means that Sunac owes nearly 600 billion yuan to suppliers and owners of uncollected properties. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xie Yifeng analyzed that in an environment where real estate is down and the market is cold, in order to solve this level of debt risk, companies can only adopt three options: extension, using housing as payment, or introducing new shareholders to cooperate in development. Way. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“The primary focus of the next step is to speed up sales collection.” Xie Yifeng said that once there is a problem with sales collection, it is easy to have problems such as arrears in project payments and commercial invoice defaults. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On February 22, 2023, Sunac issued an announcement that the company was included in the list of persons subject to enforcement for dishonesty, which showed that Sunac had eight breaches of trust, involving a face value of approximately 6.6175 million yuan, interest losses, litigation costs, etc. , the reason is that commercial bills of varying amounts have expired and have not been paid. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xie Yifeng believes that after debt restructuring, real estate companies still need to increase revenue and reduce expenditure. While developing financing channels, we should deal with negative assets, reduce scale, reduce land acquisition, and reduce pressure on the capital chain. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The above-mentioned Sunac insiders said that the company’s consideration is to invest more funds and manpower in the guaranteed building in the window period of 2-3 years after the debt restructuring. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“As of October, we have delivered 205,000 units, ranking second in the industry.” He said that the company’s goal in 2023 is to deliver 300,000 units, and the task in 2024 is equivalent to this. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This means that in the last two months of 2023, Sunac still has the task of delivering nearly 100,000 houses. The insider admitted that &lt;span>; the company is still facing delivery pressure and is using multiple financing channels to ease financial pressure. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color: orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https: //feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 23 Nov 2023 08:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[直击人性底线，大逃杀王者回归]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261053]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-22 23:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data-mpa-powered-by=&quot;yiban.io&quot;>;&lt;span>;Eleven years ago, &quot;Hunger&quot; The main trilogy of &quot;Game&quot; (four films in total) has become popular all over the world, with a cumulative box office of nearly 3 billion.

The slogan on the title page of the novel &quot;From a handsome boy to a president, Snow The description of &quot;what a price was paid&quot; is also worthy of scrutiny. Judging from the information conveyed in the film, Snowburn is an ambitious, ruthless, paranoid, sensitive and powerful egoist. In the process of betraying his friends and abandoning his lover, he gradually tore off the mask of elegance and respectability, buried the compassion of the young man, and finally returned to his true self. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/22/d84e8f7ed303a2dcec5795c8f77bd148.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1036&quot; height=&quot;432&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/22/d84e8f7ed303a2dcec5795c8f77bd148.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;259115 &quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The successful portrayal of Snow is the biggest highlight of &quot;The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes&quot;. His character arc in one movie even exceeds that of Kegnis in four movies. The latter is already a character carefully portrayed in commercial blockbusters. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Otherwise, however, &quot;Song of Songbirds and Snakes&quot; is lackluster. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Let’s talk about the controversial heroine first.

The heroine of &quot;Snow White&quot;. &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;In &quot;The Song of Songbirds and Snakes&quot;, she sang well, but her acting skills were &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;speak&lt;/span>;&lt;span>; barely watchable&lt;/span>;&lt;span>; , and the gap between her and the male protagonist in the affectionate scene is extremely obvious&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;. &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;It’s not that the audience &lt;/span>;&lt;span>; is harsh, but compared with Jennifer Lawrence, she does still have a long way to go. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/22/23d52c2f9a95d02fa380f7b0c909cbac.gif&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;245&quot; height=&quot;130&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/22/23d52c2f9a95d02fa380f7b0c909cbac.gif&quot; data-key=&quot;259116 &quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/22/68fdf8e7c843b4f6df1bb52a55e95b42.gif&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;545&quot; height=&quot;243&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/22/68fdf8e7c843b4f6df1bb52a55e95b42.gif&quot; data-key=&quot;259117&quot;>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span>;(The picture shows a comparison of the same action)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;About the game Setting, obviously the 74th Hunger Games depicted in the first part of the sequel is the best. Both the pre-game preparation and the actual combat are full of ingenuity, allowing the audience to feast their eyes on the visual spectacle. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The 10th Hunger Games in &quot;The Song of Songbirds and Snakes&quot; was quite simple. It was still an indoor game in a stadium, which made the action scenes that the series is proud of completely absent. No room for display. After watching the game, all I remember is that a group of tributes finished the game in a hurry, offering their heads one by one without any highlights. Audiences looking for the thrill of a battle royale game may be disappointed, because the movie is quite restrained in its presentation of spectacles such as killing and violence. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/22/86f56582524ffc2bd8dc4cc7acd95bc6.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;451&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/22/86f56582524ffc2bd8dc4cc7acd95bc6.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;259118 &quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;On the other hand, the reflections on reality shows and the discussion of revolution in the main trilogy are nowhere to be found in &quot;The Song of Songbirds and Snakes&quot;. This may be the filmmaker&#39;s strategy to avoid repeating itself, but it also blocks the possibility of the text digging deeper into derivatives. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/22/9a1b5b6d556ed3df4774259cc065da4c.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;449&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/22/9a1b5b6d556ed3df4774259cc065da4c.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;259119 &quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Therefore, if you are looking for the critical and gaming experience of the &quot;Hunger Games&quot; series in the movie, you may be disappointed. But if you are interested in character stories, you can still watch it. &quot;Song of Songbirds and Snakes&quot; does have some subtle touches in this regard, which makes people suddenly moved by the foreshadowing of fate. &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;&lt;span>;When old President Snow sees the rebellious girl Katniss from District 12 singing &quot;The Hanging Tree&quot;, will he think of his youth?

(Information picture)&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Let me briefly introduce myself first.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A simple opening question was handed over from the other side. The answer to this question could be &quot;f(x)&#39;s Sulli&quot; or &quot;actress Choi Sulli&quot;. In front of the camera, senior artist Cui Sulli seemed a little unable to answer the question. She was silent and hesitated for about nine seconds. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I am Cui Zhenli.&quot; His tone sounded calm. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Compared with &quot;Cui Zhenli&quot;, in the Korean cultural circle, Cui Zhenli has a more famous stage name &quot;Cui Shirley&quot;. What is bound to &quot;Cui Xueli&quot; is a sweet and pure face. In 2005, Choi Jin-ri became a contracted trainee with the Korean entertainment company SM. Four years later, she debuted as a member of the girl group f(x). Because her skin is fair and she loves to laugh, fans call her &quot;Peach in the World&quot; and &quot;Pocket Sister&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sulli Cui maintains a sweet image in front of the public. But she said that she is not a &quot;cute&quot; person and is far from the public&#39;s imagination of her as a &quot;pocket sister.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At a certain moment, she doubted everything. &quot;I do what others ask me to do, but I don&#39;t know the reason for doing it.&quot; She began to seemingly rebelliously talk about a relationship that was not recognized by fans and family members, uploading sexy photos on her personal social platform, and in terms of gender concepts Conservative South Korea publishes avant-garde female perspectives. What happened next is known: the torrent of bad reviews hit her brutally. On October 14, 2019, she committed suicide at home. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On November 13, 2023, four years after Cui Shirley&#39;s death, Netflix released her posthumous work &quot;To the Truth&quot;. In this documentary, interviewers talk to her about her pain and weakness during those years, as well as her doubts and reflections about being in the star-making industry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For each question, she remained silent and thinking for a long time. In &quot;To the Truth&quot;, she expresses the suppression of people by the entertainment industry. &quot;Do you know &quot;Nikita&quot;? It&#39;s like that movie. You can say that we are all puppets, who cares if we are tired?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Being a K-pop idol is the worst. &quot;In between interviews in the documentary, she bluntly said that people don&#39;t seem to think celebrities are people. &quot;When I first entered the entertainment industry, people kept telling me one thing, you are a product. I didn&#39;t think it was ridiculous at the time. You must be the most beautiful and first-class product facing the public.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt; p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;For a long time after her debut, Cui Xueli maintained a sweet and smiling public image.

(Visual China Picture)&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“The only thing I can control is self-blame and self-deprecation”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Before becoming the artist Choi Shirley, Choi Jin-jin was born in Busan, South Korea. Her parents divorced when she was 7 years old. The mother raised three children and was financially strapped, so she had to work hard to make a living in the labor market. When Cui Zhenli reached the age of going to school, her mother thought, &quot;Instead of sending her to kindergarten, it is better to send her to an (acting) academy.&quot; That was the starting point for the intersection between Cui Jinri&#39;s life and the entertainment industry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Cui Zhenli only has a vague impression of his father - a man who is always half-lying and watching TV, but he has a deep attachment to his mother. When she was a child, her mother was often not at home. &quot;It was my job to wait for my mother every day. I wanted to make a doll that was exactly like my mother.&quot; She said that the relationship between mother and daughter was like &quot;twins or doppelgangers.&quot; &quot;I don&#39;t like green. It&#39;s not my favorite color. One day I asked her (mother), what is your favorite color? She said green. I told everyone that I like green.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In the art film &quot;4: Clean Island&quot; based on Shirley&#39;s personal experience, the mother is an image who died very early. She writes a &quot;4&quot; on the face of her young daughter with blood, and the daughter grows up alone. Big, living as a butcher of pigs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Why am I so unconfident in everything? I really think about the injuries I suffered when I was a child. Love. I left my father without doing anything wrong. I was afraid that if I did something wrong and caused trouble, even my mother would leave. So I always had no self and only agreed and listened to my mother&#39;s opinions.&quot; Cui Zhenli later Such revealing of inner thoughts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Cui Zhenli became Cui Xueli because of a report. At that time, she was spotted by Lee Byung-hun, the director of &quot;Dae Jang Geum&quot;, and among more than a hundred young actors, she was selected to play the role of Princess Sun Hwa in &quot;The Rhyme of Sweet Potatoes&quot;. The reporter who came to interview felt that the name &quot;Truth&quot; had too strong a Christian connotation, so they discussed changing the name. Later, the report appeared in the newspapers, and Cui Zhenli became Cui Xueli. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is how Cui Xueli was noticed by SM Entertainment. In the fifth grade of elementary school, Cui Xueli left Busan and started life as a trainee at SM Entertainment in Seoul. A new life unfolded, and while she was excited, she also felt hidden worries: &quot;Do I really have to live separately from my family?&quot; &quot;Can I adapt here?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;While living in the dormitory, she was actually very worried. It is difficult to fully take care of your own life. My mother later learned from the staff that Shirley’s hair often had a rancid smell at that time because she couldn’t wash her hair cleanly. Cui Shirley once said during her lifetime that she &quot;often had to look at people&#39;s looks in order to survive.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Having just signed with SM, the company’s training goal for Cui Xueli is not a Korean idol, but an actor. At that time, Shirley had already made a name for herself in film and television productions such as &quot;The Sweet Potato Rhyme&quot;. She stayed in Seoul until she graduated from elementary school, and she suddenly grew to over 1.7 meters tall. This is an embarrassing height for a child actor. My body type is no longer suitable for being a child actor and playing teenage roles, and my mind and experience are not up to par. SM Entertainment, which made its fortune with idol groups, placed her on another track: becoming a member of a girl group. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2009, Cui Shirley debuted as a member of the Korean girl group f(x). She quickly became popular among fans for her outstanding appearance. After transitioning from an actress to an idol, she faced another complete, precise and streamlined idol-starmaking industry. There is an unwritten underlying concept in the Korean entertainment industry. Actors have a higher level than idols, and actors have more autonomy, while idols must be cautious even in love. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As an idol, Cui Xueli has a wary attitude towards fame, &quot;I understand what it means to be famous, but I am also very scared. I always feel that it is a bubble. So try not to look at it. Try to Turn around.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before the age of 20, Cui Xueli endured everything that &quot;beautiful&quot; brought to her - the support of the crowd and the love of fans. Korean entertainment reporters commented on her appearance, saying that even if she is away from the team, she can still attract fans with her beauty. But she also felt trapped by her appearance. &quot;Every time someone complimented me on my beauty, I wanted to know why they said that... I felt that I had to be beautiful. I was even left out because my behavior was not beautiful enough.&quot; .&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Truth, you seem to be under strict control and restraint. How do you cope with such great pressure?&quot; In the documentary &quot;To Truth&quot;, the interviewer asked a question. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“The only thing I have control over is blaming myself and putting myself down,” she replied. “The only time I feel like I have control is when I make myself miserable.”&lt; /p>; &lt;p>;&quot;But that&#39;s too painful. There is a limit to people&#39;s ability to endure pain. Maybe the problem is in the industry itself, not necessarily your problem.&quot; The interviewer said, &quot;This may not be your fault.&quot;&lt; /p>; &lt;p>;In front of the camera, Cui Xueli’s eyes suddenly became moist. She raised her head and said, &quot;No,&quot; pretending to be relaxed. Then she faced the camera, showed a standard smile, and asked, &quot;Can I laugh?&quot; She choked with sobs and said, &quot;I don&#39;t have this choice.&quot;&lt;/p >; &lt;p>;She said that she has always been wearing a mask called &quot;being brave&quot; and often &quot;pretending to be okay&quot;. &quot;I always don&#39;t want to show that I am weak. I feel embarrassed. I often have such a sense of shame.&quot;&lt; /p>; &lt;p>;During the interview, she said more than once that she &quot;screwed up&quot; the interview. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;Sulli Cui starred in the personal reality show &quot;The Truth Store&quot;.

(File photo)&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;The feeling of being left alone in this world&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;At the age of 20, Cui Xueli decided to break the idol&#39;s mask. She plans to do two things. The first is to find herself a therapist, and the second is to date someone else. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the eyes of many people, the &quot;personality&quot; of Sulli that fans and the public bought into began to collapse after she fell in love. In the past, the outside world fixed her image as the girl next door. News of her relationship broke out that she was dating Cui Zi, a member of the hip-hop group Dynamicduo, who is 14 years older than her. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“The first love rumors are inherently very sensitive for idols. Who the first love rumors are about is really important. Everyone is concerned about Sulli’s first love &quot;The target.&quot; TVDaily reporter Kim Ji-hyun said in an MBC documentary, &quot;The problem is Choi Ja who is too different in age.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;My mother, Kim Soo-jung, was firmly opposed to this relationship, and the mother and daughter even broke up because of it. No more contact. In Jin Xiujing&#39;s view, that was the starting point of the family&#39;s misfortune. &quot;Before the love rumors broke out, our family was happy. It has always been.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fans are also dissatisfied with this relationship. When the love affair broke out, it was during the golden period of f(x)&#39;s development, and love affects the development of the team. Some fans noticed in the live stage video that Cui Xueli sometimes did not dance properly, and suspected that she was &quot;paddling&quot;. Kim Soo-jung revealed that since then, her daughter has suffered from depression and panic disorder. &quot;The fans are cheering right in front of me, and there are good and bad words. You have to listen to these while performing on the stage.&quot; After Shirley passed away, Jin Xiujing returned to the empty house and discovered countless medicines that were far beyond the digestion capacity of ordinary people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although Cui Xueli felt happy in this relationship, during their relationship, Cui Zi caused controversy due to the more explicit lyrics in the new song &quot;Eat, Sleep,&quot;. In 2015, Sulli officially quit f(x). In 2017, the two announced their breakup. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“(I) was hurt by others, and the whole person collapsed at that time. Because of these people, I can rely on someone. Hiding behind others, I can also feel positive energy. But I am very close to you. People close to me and people around me gradually left me. Because they are also cowardly people, they only take care of themselves. I also thought about asking for help, but they did not lend a hand at that time.&quot; Cui Shirley said that she had the feeling that &quot;a person is being The feeling of remaining in this world.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A few years before her death, many of the contents Cui Shirley posted on social platforms were accused of being &quot;out of line.&quot; A video of squirting cream in the mouth was considered by netizens to have &quot;sexual connotations&quot;; a dinner party with friends and the embarrassment of being drunk was considered &quot;crazy&quot;; a photo of a party with close friends showed a group of men and women hugging happily, causing &quot; Doing drugs&quot; suspicion. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Every move she makes is noticed, and the media loves to create some eye-catching headlines. Every time there is a new trend, abusive comments flood into the news links. During a live broadcast, a friend read out a comment from an onlooker: I came to the live broadcast room just to see what strange things Cui Xueli did again. She is called &quot;Guan Zhong&quot; by many people, which means: someone who loves to show off her position to attract people&#39;s attention. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For young Cui Xueli, these turbulent malices and doubts are not easy to resist. In a video interview, Cui Xueli smiled and said to the camera as if begging for mercy: &quot;Viewers, please love me a little more, journalists, please love me a little more.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I really am not Bad guy,” she said on numerous occasions. &lt;p>; 》Stills.

After a long period of silence, she participated in &quot;The Truth Store&quot; and Variety shows such as &quot;Night of Bad Comments&quot; have more public schedules. In the same year, she released her first album &quot;Goblin&quot;. In June of that year, at a fan meeting to commemorate the release of her first solo album, she told the fans in the audience: &quot;I will live seriously.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Four months later, she lived alone He ended his life at home. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the 2019 Korean variety show &quot;Night of Bad Comments&quot;, Cui Xueli, a pink-haired girl, responded one by one to the negative comments that netizens have put on her over the years. She talked about the &quot;no bra&quot; controversy that has been surrounding her, and naturally talked to the host about her understanding of underwear, &quot;underwear is like accessories.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“When I first posted the photo without underwear, a lot of people were talking about it. I was scared and could have hidden it, but I didn’t. The reason was that I wanted to change people’s perception of it &quot;I also want to say that it&#39;s not a big deal,&quot; she said. &quot;I think it&#39;s about personal freedom. Underwear is not good for health. They have underwires, which are not good for the digestive organs. I also have problems with my digestion.&quot; . It’s more comfortable not to wear them, so I won’t wear them.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After Shirley’s death, some foreign media commented that she is in an industry that “encourages performers to remain silent off stage.” She exists as a valuable rebel. Another potential consensus regarding idols as commodities in South Korea is that idols should not talk about current affairs or comment on social events. But Cui Shirley chose to break it time and time again. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Korean society where gender concepts are relatively conservative, many of her public expressions appear to be avant-garde. She said she wanted to get rid of &quot;menstrual shame&quot; and told the male host on a variety show that if you support equality between men and women, then you are a feminist. On April 11, 2019, South Korea abolished the crime of abortion, and she was one of the few female public figures to publicly express support. On Instagram that day, she posted: &quot;Today is such a glorious day, giving all women the right to choose.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Those things I do on social media are all done because I want to Do. My behavior and consciousness are fundamentally consistent with those who support feminism. The idea that women should not do that, speak loudly or have strong opinions is contrary to who I am as a person. I don’t like what they say. Men can talk openly about sex, their desires or dissatisfaction, and will be praised for being outspoken in these areas. But if women do the same, they will be regarded as vulgar and self-righteous, and they will be reprimanded.&quot; In the documentary &quot;For&quot; &quot;Truth&quot;, Cui Shirley responded. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;The fact that Shirley repeatedly did things that misogynists didn&#39;t like and refused to apologize is what really attracted her attention.&quot; After Shirley&#39;s death, Indiana University Korean Culture and Society Expert CedarBough Saeji said in an interview with CNN, &quot;It&#39;s incredible that society criticized her so harshly just because she showed her personality in a way that didn&#39;t fully conform to the norms of Korean society.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She Shortly before her death, a friend received a call from her. Friends recalled that Shirley&#39;s voice sounded worse than bad. She said she felt lonely. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For a long time, Cui Shirley has had a need for a sense of belonging and security around her. &quot;From the beginning, I had to directly enter the complex real world. As a result, I didn&#39;t understand many things. This led me to want to find a sense of belonging. And the stable state that comes with a sense of belonging.&quot; In the documentary , the interviewer asked her who she cared about most, and she said they were the members of f(x). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In a video interview, f(x) member Luna said that they had not seen each other for five years since Sulli left the group. Shirley once took the initiative to contact her and sent her a text message: &quot;Sister, I miss my sister.&quot; That was the first time in the 15 years since they had known each other that Shirley used the semi-speech between peers instead of honorifics to talk to her. Speech. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;It feels like I sent this text message after enduring it for a long time. As a sister, I feel sorry. I should have gone to her first.&quot; Luna cried in front of the camera. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Cui Xueli stayed in the &quot;unstable state&quot; of cutting off contact with her mother, falling out of love, leaving the team, and being criticized by the outside world for a long time. Sometimes, she broadcasts live and communicates with fans. Sometimes she shows almost restless excitement, and sometimes she falls into a trance, and her eyes almost lose their sparkle. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sulli Cui participated in the creation of all lyrics in the album &quot;Goblin&quot;. One of them is called &quot;On the Moon&quot;, and her true feelings may be hidden in the lyrics. The lyrics read: &quot;Let us ride on the Galaxy Railway 999 together/Now I want to be/a happy girl forever/Your happy girl/Carry the doll in my sleeping dreamland/Drive away the fear in my beautiful dream / The little man on the shoulder took over my memories / Easily took away the flying colors that painted me / In the middle of the night, with my fascination with the world in the book / Take away the freedom of this cold body / Stop my mother from clasping her hands &#39;s prayer/to the moon.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2013, the five members of f(x) went to New Zealand to film a variety show, where they jointly buried their first time capsule as adults.

The article &quot;Talk about my courage education for children&lt;/u>;&lt;/a>;&lt;/span>;&quot; made me think back to my past cowardice and think again about what I should do when my children are bullied. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One day not long ago, my child came back and told me that a classmate always stepped on his feet when waiting in line and frequently pushed himself during outdoor activities. I asked him, had he told the teacher? The child said that he told her, but when confronted, the other party said that he had not stepped in, and then the matter was settled. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I thought about it and the only way I could think of was to stay away from him. I told my son, if he sees him approaching you during outdoor activities, you should stay away from him quickly. My son smiled and said he was so tired, and asked me what if I didn&#39;t guard against him. I was dumbfounded. I wanted to tell him to adapt to circumstances. The subtext of this sentence was to step back, but I didn&#39;t say it out loud. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A few days later, I went to pick up my children from school. I went there early and was first in line. After picking up my children, I waited aside. When the child&#39;s parents showed up, I walked over and explained the situation to the other mother. The other mother was very polite and said that her child sometimes goes &quot;crazy&quot; and likes to be clingy to others. We will talk about it later. After some time, I asked the child if he had been stepped on recently. The child said that after successfully hiding a few times, he had not been stepped on recently. He went to step on others. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;My earliest memory of bullying is in the toilet on the rural primary school campus. Several children surrounded a classmate who was urinating. Some were holding small bricks in their hands, and some were moving their fists as if to do something. Ready to swing out at any time. At that time, I often timidly walked out after going to the toilet. Occasionally when no one was outside, I would shout &quot;The teacher is here&quot; and then run away. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At that time, there were no obvious differences in the families of bullies or victims. The only obvious difference was that if the victims came from towns, they were more likely to have parents come to school to complain about their children, while victims from rural families were more likely Most of them will not be taken seriously by their parents. Firstly, they are busy with farm work. Secondly, they think that small fights are normal and not worth mentioning. Unless there is a serious physical injury, they will come to school to seek feedback from the teacher. Of course, the quality of the feedback depends on whether you can meet a fair and strict class teacher, rather than being a messy teacher. As for psychological trauma, in rural schools twenty years ago, almost no one had ever heard of such a term. Such neglect will make the victim&#39;s memory become unforgettable, and even decades later it will be awakened due to certain factors. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After all these years, I still remember a Japanese drama &quot;Housekeeper Mita&quot; I watched ten years ago. In foreign works, I found some common emotional cowardice in human nature. In the play, while the family was having dinner, they watched a news story about a primary school student who committed suicide after being bullied, which aroused discussion among the family. During the discussion, the younger son was asked if he had been bullied, but he chose to conceal it and deny it. The youngest daughter who is in kindergarten asked Mita why some people bully others. Mita replied expressionlessly that it is because humans are fragile animals who bully the weak and fear the strong. The answer was sharp and harsh. The younger son experienced being coerced by classmates to cooperate in cheating, and finally when he was coerced into stealing, he chose to ask Mita for help. Mita&#39;s &quot;violence&quot; helped put the boy into a dilemma of more serious threats and misunderstandings by his relatives and teachers. When faced with more severe threats of bullying, the younger son once again sought Mita&#39;s &quot;violent&quot; help. This time the help rose to the threat of death. In the confrontation with the bully, the younger son completed his ideological transformation and awakening. He stopped Sita in time and started a boy-to-boy duel with him. Those words of accusation are heartbreaking, but these blood and tears have not changed the bullies, which makes people sigh. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Looking back on the bullying I encountered when I was young, the usual solution was to endure it or avoid it, mostly to survive the sorting or further education. So, when my children faced similar bullying, I didn’t have many alternative answers in mind, and the solutions I threw out were old and pedantic. When I asked a friend who has children, what do you hope to gain if your child is bullied by others, she said that she can communicate freely without being influenced by external factors. She said it in a subtle way. I know that what she is afraid of is encountering injustice. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In real-life cases, bullies rarely turn to kindness. Looking at the Korean dramas that are rich in campus bullying dramas, the mode of those dramas will probably move towards the &quot;cool drama&quot; mode, that is, in the end, violence is used to counter violence, and the victim In the end, the violence was suppressed, and the perpetrators were punished by law. However, the reality is that both parties often go to the abyss of tragedy, and the positive ending we expect rarely occurs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Children can be healed from the trauma of bullying. In addition to a small chance of self-healing, the other part is the gentle treatment by other students. When children come back every day, they will share their happiness in school. In addition to occasionally telling who they were bullied by, they also share who helped them. For example, who shared a mosquito repellent bracelet with them, and who helped them forget to forget during outdoor activities. Take the kettle back to the classroom, etc. Those actions that many adults think are trivial have established the feelings of friendship and mutual help among children since childhood. At this time, I will tell him that when others encounter similar problems and you happen to be able to help, you should help. Such actions will invisibly take root and blossom in the other person&#39;s heart. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The impact of injury or redemption in youth often lasts a lifetime. This has been verified in many realistic works. Fortunately, I still have a warm memory. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fifteen years ago, I was in my second year of high school. There was a small college entrance examination that year. I took a few subjects in advance and needed to take a two-hour bus from the town to the city. I had never been on a long-distance bus before, and I started to get motion sickness as soon as I got on the bus. I was sweating and felt dizzy. There were more than a dozen seats in that minibus, and most people had to stand. The female classmates next to me quickly noticed something strange about me. The two girls stood up and asked me to lie down on the seat. They took out cooling oil and applied it to me. That kind of tenderness still warms my heart when I think about it. Their actions helped me learn and have empathy very early on. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If I were to compare my progress with that of the previous generation of parents when their children were bullied, it would probably be that my first reaction was to ask where the child was hurt, rather than asking why the child bullied you. Not bullying others. But my parents and I face the same dilemma. Apart from keeping our children away from bullies, there are not many routes and methods for us to choose calmly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(The author is a worker in the cultural industry)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>; •&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;(The &quot;hi, Southern Weekly&quot; column of Southern Weekend App is looking forward to your contributions.

The school stipulates that if the front row is not full, the last row will be in violation, which is staggering. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Henan Xinxiang Medical College has launched a school-wide special inspection of academic style since November 20. The inspections included &quot;four no&#39;s&quot;: not bringing teaching materials, not taking notes, not asking questions, and not sitting in the front row. Phenomenon. Henan Institute of Technology requires the establishment of an &quot;inspection-nurture&quot; system, focusing on checking the &quot;attendance rate, head-up rate, and front-row student occupancy rate&quot; of students&#39; classrooms. The School of Transportation Engineering of Changsha University of Science and Technology requires students to take the initiative to &quot;sit in the front row, raise their heads, bring teaching materials, and ask questions&quot;...&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The first impression this gives people is , treating college students as children. In addition to requiring college students to bring textbooks, sit in the front row, and take notes, many colleges and universities require students not to stay in the dormitory for self-study at night, and there are also bed and hygiene checks. In fact, except for professional courses, classmates may not take the same courses, and different courses use different classrooms. They do not have fixed classrooms and locations like middle school and high school students. Why should we discipline college students like children and fail to respect the right of adults to self-determination? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When I was in college more than 20 years ago, I still remember that there were two ways for people to occupy positions. For courses with well-educated teachers, wonderful lectures, and popular courses, the front rows will be occupied first, and those who come later will have to sit in the back; for courses with mediocre or unsatisfactory teachers, dry lectures, and less popular courses, Those who came first would occupy the back row, while those who came later had to sit in the front row, endure the direct attention of the teacher, and had to pretend to listen carefully and respond positively. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The former method is a medal for a good teacher. The latter method is often because although the class is not interesting or the teaching is poor, but you don’t want to fail, or because the teacher has to take attendance and take attendance, but he can’t retain the students. students will resist in a negative way. Therefore, some teachers often say in the first class: Come and go as you please, without calling names, but you will be responsible for not doing your homework or failing the exam. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So, for teachers, their primary mission is to transfer valuable professional knowledge and skills to students by relying on their profound knowledge and superb teaching skills. This is to attract students rather than force them to accept it. own teaching content. Good spiritual food is full of fragrant air. If you don&#39;t say anything about peaches and plums, you will make your own mistakes. A melon that is twisted is not sweet, and a horse that doesn&#39;t drink water is meaningless. These principles are well known to everyone, and this is also the basic way to be a teacher. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In other words, teachers and schools can only ask themselves to have a good &quot;teaching style&quot; and convince students; instead of first requiring students to have a certain ideal &quot;study style&quot;, There are no requirements for teachers’ teaching ability. This is simply putting the cart before the horse. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The lectures are clearly scripted and lackluster. They also require students to sit in the front row as if they are taking a popular course. They force students to raise their heads and act like they are listening attentively, interact in a pretentious manner, and deprive students of passive coping skills. The rights of the curriculum, this is simply to torture students mentally. Moreover, forcing bad courses and bad teachers to enjoy the same treatment as good courses and good teachers is like trying to sell rotten and sour apples at the same price as good and sweet apples. It is completely challenging the laws of the market and human nature. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From an economic point of view, higher education or packaged professional subject knowledge products are no different from other goods and services. Teachers and schools are the providers, and students are the demanders. The rights and interests of both parties They are equal in terms of personality, and there is no reason why one party can discipline the other party infinitely. Reasonable classroom discipline is required. For example, no student can disrupt the peace and process of the classroom, because this damages the dignity of the teacher and the rights of other students. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But conversely, it cannot be established as a rule or obligation to require college students to listen carefully, because college students are adults. From the perspective of interests, if he feels that the content is important, he will listen carefully and even study further after class. However, if he feels that he has mastered it, either this part of the content is not important, or he underestimates the importance of the content and wanders around. Outside of that, as long as it doesn&#39;t disrupt the peace and flow of the class, it shouldn&#39;t be considered a problem that needs to be solved. From the perspective of rights, there are reasonable boundaries between teachers and students. Students&#39; passive coping is the basic freedom. Students&#39; activeness and seriousness are earned (earned), not deserved. Let students grab the front row and occupy a good seat to get the best. The mental and spiritual enjoyment is the goal of teachers and can even be said to be their duty. At this point, the treatment of college students should be different from that of primary and secondary school students. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for supervising whether college students bring textbooks and take notes, this ignores the characteristics of university knowledge transfer. As long as you go to a higher-end university and have teachers who are interested in teaching, the teaching materials for a course are often only outlines and summary, which will definitely involve the reading and discussion of a large number of related books and papers. Unless certain courses follow the textbook, it will be difficult to read. There is no reason why all students must bring textbooks; of course, if the textbook itself is a classic and worthy of in-depth study word for word, then students should generally bring textbooks, but if a student occasionally forgets to bring them, it is not a problem. It can be a perfect solution when used together in the classroom. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If the teacher is reading from the text, there is no need for students to take notes; if the teacher’s lecture is particularly exciting, then the students will pay full attention and devote themselves to listening, absorbing, and absorbing what the teacher has to say. It becomes your own thing. There is no need to take notes in class, so as not to affect the absorption effect of the present. It can be summarized and organized afterwards, and it can further deepen the understanding. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A good teaching and learning style is to respect students&#39; sovereignty as adults, allow students to exert their personal autonomy, enhance their ability to self-govern, and cultivate their sense of personal responsibility. The biggest difference between studying in universities and primary and secondary schools is that college students need to invest more in thinking and sharpen their personal understanding and analysis. Learning a major is to logically build a complete knowledge system in their brains and become a major. Part of subjectivity, the memory part is relatively secondary. Force and indoctrination are meaningless. Only things that students truly think through will become their own. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to improve the teaching style and study style of a certain university, a &quot;Typical Case of the School of Medical Imaging Testing and Rehabilitation&quot; was established, and three rules were established: &quot;Sit in the front row&quot;, requiring students to give priority to sitting in the front row; &quot;Double reporting&quot; , if the front row is not full, the school committee will record the list of students in the last row and report it to the teacher and counselor. Pay close attention to the implementation so that everyone does not dare to violate the rules: first time: anonymously report his behavior and ask other students to learn from it; second time: ask him to publicly review his name during the evening roll call, and the class will set up a special team to follow up and inspect; third time: Times: Inform parents that if they commit the crime again, they will need to come to the school to communicate, or they will be &quot;accompanied&quot;. Frankly speaking, this is a way to manage primary school students, and it is a very bad way to manage primary school students. It is not only inappropriate to use it on college students. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 22 Nov 2023 20:25:03 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
