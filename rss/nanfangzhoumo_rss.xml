Although the Serbian team failed to win the final victory in the decisive battle, in this World Cup they made it all the way to the final in the absence of several top stars, which once again proved the amazing strength of this veteran European team. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some are happy and some are sad. The Chinese men’s basketball team ranked only 29th among the 32 participating teams. The coach is Alexander Djordje, the famous coach who holds the Lifetime Achievement Award of the Serbian Basketball Coaches Association. Vicky, for him and the Chinese men&#39;s basketball team, the trip to the Philippines World Cup was full of frustration and depression. The Chinese men&#39;s basketball team lost to Serbia 63-105 in the first game of the World Cup. This day happened to be Lao Qiao&#39;s 56th birthday. Before the game, many members of the Serbian team sent blessings to the legend, but after the game started, the birthday boy could only shake his head. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On November 16, 2022, the Chinese Basketball Association made adjustments to the head coach of the Chinese Men’s Basketball National Team and announced the selection of Djordjevic as the head coach of the Chinese Men’s Basketball National Team. His task is to lead the Chinese men&#39;s basketball team in the sixth window of the 2023 Men&#39;s Basketball World Cup qualifying period and the 2023 Men&#39;s Basketball World Cup, striving to lead the team to qualify for the 2024 Paris Olympics. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Chinese men’s basketball team spent a lot of money to hire a world-class coach to lead the army, and naturalized NBA star Kyle Lee joined the team. The largest investment in the history of the Chinese men’s basketball team resulted in one win and four losses in this World Cup, setting the worst record in history. At the same time, he lost his Olympic ticket again and fell into the abyss. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Chinese men’s basketball team performed poorly in the last Olympic cycle and failed to qualify for the Tokyo Olympics. This time it failed to qualify for the Paris Olympics, which means that a generation of players cannot participate in the highest level during their golden period of competition. competition. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past, when participating in the Olympic Games, the flag bearer of the Chinese delegation would be a tall and handsome Chinese men&#39;s basketball star. Now, the Chinese men&#39;s basketball team, which has missed two consecutive Olympics, has even lost a standard-bearer who can guide the direction - veteran Yi Jianlian, who was unable to go with the team, announced his retirement before the last game of the Chinese men&#39;s basketball group stage. Fans lamented that since before the Olympics, Without being able to compete for eight to eight years, the glory of the Chinese men&#39;s basketball team has completely faded. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;How should the Chinese men’s basketball team move forward? &quot;Southern People Weekly&quot; conducted an exclusive interview with Gong Luming, the famous Chinese basketball coach. At the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, at the age of 39, he directed the Chinese team to reach the top eight in the Olympics for the first time. This is the best record that has not been broken so far. This group of players is also known as the &quot;96 Golden Generation&quot;. When the Chinese men&#39;s basketball team hit a trough in 2014, he was asked to come out. A year later, he once again brought the Chinese men&#39;s basketball team back to the top in Asia. This legendary guard, who is only 1.72 meters tall, is known as the &quot;fire-fighting master&quot; of Chinese basketball. In 1999, he became the head coach at the lowest point when the Chinese women&#39;s basketball team lost the qualification to compete in the Sydney Olympics. Through major changes and all-round team building, he created a young and brave golden generation of women&#39;s basketball, winning the 2001 Asian Women&#39;s Basketball Championship and the 2001 Women&#39;s Basketball Asian Championship. He won two titles at the 2002 Asian Games and finished sixth at the 2002 World Championships. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The following is the self-report of coach Gong Luming:&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;1&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>; I personally strongly agree with the strengthening of international exchanges in Chinese basketball. It is a good thing for the Chinese Basketball Association to hire foreign coaches, especially famous foreign coaches. They can bring us a lot of good experience in terms of confrontation, concepts, and methods. . However, some practical factors must be taken into consideration on how to properly coordinate the coaching team and how to give full play to the role of foreign teachers. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;The specialty of foreign coaches is high professionalism, concentration and seriousness, and their coaching level is also certain He was selected by the Chinese Basketball Association only after he has reached a certain height. There is no doubt about this. Most of them grew up in a highly professional basketball environment and believe that everyone in the team, including themselves, has sufficient professionalism. After assembling a national team, foreign teachers rarely think that the construction and management of the team and the improvement of athletes&#39; skills are also one of the priorities of the head coach. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;They are more accustomed to focusing on the court, such as the tactical system, lineup configuration, and opponents. Research, etc., and many other things, he will think that it is your athlete&#39;s own business, or that a mature professional athlete should have solved the problem long ago. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;When foreign teachers serve as head coaches, although they will be equipped with excellent Chinese coaches as assistants, the basic Foreign head coaches rarely have in-depth and active communication with Chinese coaches. To be honest, they may not necessarily like our Chinese coaches, so we will see that the foreign head coaches are very dedicated and very courageous to carry out their work, but there are very few opportunities for Chinese and foreign coaches to formally exchange opinions or communicate. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;From our past experience, if a foreign teacher serves as an assistant coach, he will actively communicate with the head coach To communicate, he will actively communicate with the Chinese coaching staff the various information he has seen and collected, as well as how to deal with it. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Over the years, whether it is the national team or local clubs, our basketball world has formed such a The coaching environment: Unless the Chinese coach is very proactive and actively cooperates with the foreign teacher and asks the foreign teacher for advice, he may talk more to the Chinese coach. If you don&#39;t do this and you just follow the foreign teacher, he will not actually give you any help. But if the Chinese side is the head coach, the foreign teacher will actively communicate with you about his experience, knowledge or methods. This is a very realistic thing. Such a coaching culture has been formed over the years. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Another point is that even if there are no foreign teachers, the coaching staff is all local coaches. There is also an unwritten rule. I am used to following the arrangements of the head coach. To put it simply, if you don’t arrange things, I won’t do it. If the head coach has spoken and arranged for me, I will do it. If the head coach does not ask for it, then the assistant coach will not express his opinion easily. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;These are our &quot;basketball culture&quot;. When hiring foreign teachers, you must consider these practical factors. In fact, it is very difficult. There has been a consensus within the circle for a long time that foreign teachers can be used and the ball can be lost, but the initiative must be in our own hands. Even if we lose, we must let our own coaches know how to lose. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/O4yeTzwTaxr80Zv1c1vc6sHZGmgOxdACXvM7x0pw.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/O4yeTzwTaxr80Zv1c1vc6sHZGmgOxdACXvM7x0pw.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250580&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On October 3, 2015, in Changsha, Hunan, the Chinese men&#39;s basketball team won the 2015 Asian Men&#39;s Basketball Championship.

Can foreign teachers really save Chinese basketball? not necessarily! To this day, the best record in the history of China&#39;s men&#39;s and women&#39;s basketball teams is still led by our own local coaches. Group projects have their own particularity and complexity. It is not easy to achieve a breakthrough through a foreign teacher. This is something we must think about when building our team. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;When you invite foreign teachers in, you can&#39;t lose all your own things. Your own things have been accumulated over several generations and are suitable for your own personnel characteristics and specific environment. These experiences have been tested by specific practices. You can&#39;t just follow others and succeed. Making up for our shortcomings and developing our own strengths is fundamental. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Some words may sound a bit outdated, but I still have to say that I always insist on paying attention to team building Ideological work. The so-called ideological work is not an empty long speech. It can be combined with many things in daily work requirements and business learning. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Foreign teachers don’t care about team building, and they don’t know how to do this kind of ideological work. Before the competition, they Carrying a jersey to that station and saying that you must be worthy of the national flag on it is considered the ideological work he has done for the players. A person&#39;s mind is not that simple. Why do you play basketball? What basic quality requirements does this profession require of you? Going a step further, what is your specific understanding of the era you live in? What requirements does this specific background of the times place on yourself and the sports industry? You can&#39;t take the ball with nothing in mind. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;It is not just the national team that lacks quality ideological work, our current professional league, there are people who can do it Is ideological education work? What social role should a professional basketball player play in today&#39;s environment? How many people can answer? We have engaged in professionalization, and players&#39; salaries have gone up, but their ideological understanding has not kept up. Athletes need guidance. Hearing people criticize the Chinese men&#39;s basketball team for &quot;male football&quot; brings disgrace to our work in basketball and football. As the old saying goes, &quot;A teacher once is a father forever&quot; and &quot;It is the fault of a son not to teach his father.&quot; From the club to the national team, have our coaches and team leaders fulfilled their responsibilities in influencing and educating young people? If a player has a problem, it must be related to management and education. No one educates him in the national team, and no one educates him when he returns home. He wanders around every day, even begging him and coaxing him, right? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/VGjynPqZDGsRtIwxJasuc8S7aHF3iszemchidAPX.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/VGjynPqZDGsRtIwxJasuc8S7aHF3iszemchidAPX.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250579&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On September 2, 2023, Manila, Philippines, in the 17-32nd group stage of the 2023 Men&#39;s Basketball World Cup, the Chinese men&#39;s basketball team lost to the Philippine men&#39;s basketball team 75-96.

What kind of atmosphere your words and deeds create is very important. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;The coach is actually an ascetic. If you want to be a good coach, you have to focus and give up many hobbies. You usually make a group of friends, train here, and arrange what to do in the evening there, so where can you go? When you are a player, you just have to take care of yourself. When you are the coach, you have to consider the affairs of the whole team. The affairs of the whole team are not one or two things. Team formation, communication between top and bottom, communication with parents, ideological issues, technical issues, the construction of the offensive and defensive system of the entire team, and opponent research, you are too busy working 24 hours a day, do you still have time to do other things? Failure to focus simply cannot solve these problems. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;A person must respect his or her job, this is what you rely on for survival or for your food. . When I was coaching the Chinese women&#39;s basketball team, I always ate out of a porcelain bowl, just to remind myself that you have to take good care of your own job, don&#39;t fight, otherwise you won&#39;t have anything to eat. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Whether you are a star athlete or a coach, you should abide by your duties and not sacrifice to show your personality. The core values ​​of sports are sunshine, health and positivity. In the past, before the national team completed training or competition tasks and before the players returned to the club, we had to set requirements for them. After returning, you must reflect the level and value of the national team members, lead by example, and take the lead in all aspects. , instead of going back to being a big name. Everyone in the league still has specific technical problems that need to be solved, and we will check them when we come back. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Wang Chen, president of Peking Union Medical College and academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, said in his 2023 opening speech, &quot;It is necessary to Take the world as your own responsibility, have real skills, and embody the nobility of life, the nobility of industry, and the nobility of health care in simple labor.&quot; Every industry must have its own professional beliefs, and the Chinese men&#39;s basketball team relies on the accumulation of generations of people If you gain a little bit of family wealth, the whole industry needs to cherish it and make practical contributions.

On the way, he talked about Guinan School, which is located at the foot of Wugui Mountain in Zhongshan City. The implication is that this private primary and secondary school has an average admission rate. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I have heard too many of the same stories. Designer and school art group teacher Zhang Yaoren could only smile helplessly. What is good and what is bad? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Achievements&quot; are always the only yardstick for most people. Zhang Yaoren didn’t think so. He is thin, in his fifties, and has been at Guinan School for more than five years. Old P, as people like to call him, is from Henan. He has been in Guangdong for more than thirty years. He settled in nearby Qixi Village a few years ago. He and Shi Lei, the principal of Guinan School, hit it off on this topic: &quot;Do children in rural areas need... Need aesthetic education?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/16/vMCE1SIISojaA1pyEdXttSCFwmE6MrnjJsd4NQjL.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 960&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/16/vMCE1SIISojaA1pyEdXttSCFwmE6MrnjJsd4NQjL.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250958&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Works by Guinan School students. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of interviewee)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Independent artist and curator Guan Yong is in his forties, has a tall figure and likes to wear Straw sandals. He has been engaged in art education since he was nineteen years old, working in kindergartens, primary schools, and art galleries in Zhuhai, Guangzhou, Macau and other places. Later, he also participated in this miniature rural aesthetic education experiment as an art director. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Initially, Guinan School had more than 40 classes, more than 1,700 students, and 3 art teachers, but there was no art classroom. In July 2018, Guinan School converted six classrooms on the first floor into art classrooms. Now, the school has eight full-time art teachers, four studios and a reading room. The teaching content involves traditional Chinese painting, printmaking, pottery, paper-cutting, etc. Guinan&#39;s campus also has a miniature art gallery that displays students&#39; works. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When visiting this place, Southern Weekend reporters were surprised by the art works hidden on campus. These works are displayed all over the campus. A large number of clay sculptures are dried on the ground, prints are posted on the walls, installation art is hung in the corridors, and handmade works are posted under the eaves. These works are quite childish, and the largest number are clay sculptures, including cups, plates, bottles, jars, and various clay figures with strange shapes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/16/Up3LZQx8CNfkgURkqUALPuYpCgqb4Tv173RGEIYA.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/16/Up3LZQx8CNfkgURkqUALPuYpCgqb4Tv173RGEIYA.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250959&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Student art works in the corridor of the teaching building of Guinan School. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of interviewee)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the comprehensive studio, weaving, sewing, embroidery and other handicrafts are completed here; folk crafts The studio is for students; the folk art room is filled with students&#39; prints, paper-cuts, etc.; in the comprehensive painting studio, you can see Chinese paintings, watercolors, oil paintings and other works by students. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/16/K4RhNWazPNxMQUDqRo9O4X3j0zIZBlSXxoWguIr8.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;720&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/16/K4RhNWazPNxMQUDqRo9O4X3j0zIZBlSXxoWguIr8.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250963&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Student prints from Guinan School. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern Weekend reporter Zhang Rui/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If you travel through the countryside, you can also see the works of students. &quot;Children&#39;s things are natural things.&quot; Zhang Yaoren pointed to the student works along the country road and said, &quot;(In the past) many paintings on the walls were relatively stiff.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In August 2023, Guan Yong and others started a rural teacher program to provide teaching support to front-line teachers from rural areas and plan to complete the training of one thousand teachers within two years. Zhang Yaoren said: &quot;We do the Thousand Talents Plan precisely because we believe that (aesthetic education) is the most important thing.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;If you have never done carpentry, you will do carpentry; if you have never played in mud, you will play in mud.&quot;&lt;/h4 >; &lt;p>;Local children mostly choose to go to public schools in towns. The students recruited by Guinan School are basically the children of migrant workers. Most of these students come from Sichuan, Hunan, Anhui and other places. Their parents left their hometown and came to the Pearl River Delta. While the students are in class, their parents sell things at nearby markets, work in factories, and do odd jobs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhang Yaoren recalled to Southern Weekend reporters that students would leave every semester. The fathers left the worksite, and the children flew away like birds. Academic performance has nothing to do with art. Zhang Yaoren said that they did not disclose the idea of ​​​​art courses to the parents of the students. He understands the parents’ thinking. Art is useless. It’s better to do more questions: “The parents must have said that my son only scored 85 points in math. Can you not let him attend the 90 minutes of art class? He might get 90 points in the exam. ”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Guan Yong has a point of view. Regarding the curriculum, the art textbooks compiled by the state are always the basis, accounting for 70% of the curriculum. The remaining 30% is carried out by the teaching team for outreach and expansion. The content of the 18 textbooks for grades one to nine was broken up and reconnected with the four studios. As the grades increase, the content offered by each studio becomes deeper. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/16/yPaKd9OGAQgZTSxdq2wI90zCjjZziTskqh66IZUd.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;720&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/16/yPaKd9OGAQgZTSxdq2wI90zCjjZziTskqh66IZUd.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250955&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Gouache painting by Guinan School students. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern Weekend reporter Zhang Rui/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;All the teaching materials were smashed and placed in the studio... The textbooks are relatively thin ,&quot; Zhang Yaoren gave an example, &quot;One class (textbook) says that the mud will be gone, but we asked the first-grade children to work here for four consecutive weeks making mud, and (the students) wanted to make bowls after finishing the cups. I also want to make a vessel with a handle, so that the child will have an understanding of the properties of clay, the complexity of materials, and the complexity of creation.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Improving teachers&#39; aesthetic and teaching abilities is the key . Five years ago, there were only two art teachers in Guinan School, and students would take out A4 paper to sketch in class. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;(Rural Art Teachers) Their professionalism is not deep. How come teachers who graduated from the National Academy of Arts and Central America come to our place? When the professional level of the teachers is not that high, how can Can you improve their level?&quot; Zhang Yaoren told the Southern Weekend reporter, &quot;Teach you how to work. If you have never done carpentry before, do carpentry, and if you have never played with mud, just play with mud.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Guan Yong et al. People prefer to refer to entering the classroom as entering the studio. They believe that art is the vocabulary of the adult world, while children&#39;s basic art education is &quot;enlightenment of students&#39; creativity and self-expression&quot; and is more like &quot;an artistic job&quot;. He rarely talks about art theory. When he encounters a problem, Guan Yong always says &quot;get moving&quot;. What should I do if I don’t have an art foundation? Guan Yong said, then work! As you dry it, you will feel it on your hands. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/16/1EySt6Joa4v1Qfj3z416218QnPl4KnxPxxZ1Z1UV.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/16/1EySt6Joa4v1Qfj3z416218QnPl4KnxPxxZ1Z1UV.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250957&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The art studio of Guinan School. Every time students finish class, they will clean up the studio as required. Zhang Yaoren believes that this is also part of aesthetic education. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of interviewee)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Guinan School does not add additional time for art classes, and of course does not allow preemption of art classes. time, students are required to complete a ninety-minute class once a week. Forty minutes of art class is simply not enough to keep children &quot;enjoyed.&quot; There is always an appreciation session at the beginning of the course. The teacher brings the pictures related to the curriculum to the children to “look at”. In nine years, students can look at tens of thousands of pictures, and these pictures become one of the sources of their aesthetic appreciation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, in the second grade course &quot;Paper Cutting - Transformation&quot;, students need to learn origami, binding, cutting and collage heads, and watch the works of Huang Yongyu, Komatsu Miu, Han Meilin and others; fifth grade The ninety-minute class in the first semester is titled &quot;Color Blow Molding - Vase Flowers&quot;. The teaching content includes engraving outlines and patterns. The materials viewed include the works of Davids, Van Gogh, Matisse, etc.; In the ninth-grade course &quot;Comprehensive Printmaking - Mask&quot;, students have to learn how to engrave lightness and grayscale, and watch the works of Gu Kaizhi, Wu Daozi, and Zhang Xuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are various equipment in the studio, including expensive printmaking machines, as well as various painting tools, glue guns, saws, etc. According to statistics, there are more than thirty kinds of paper. These materials come from Guinan School Expenditures. Zhang Yaoren said that the school has made great efforts&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/16/Q4vVA4zYwX0QyIXfpOnDVbYEIDsoi3KyR1mlocmq.jpg&quot; border =&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/16/Q4vVA4zYwX0QyIXfpOnDVbYEIDsoi3KyR1mlocmq.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250956&quot; >;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In the art studio of Guinan School, the drawers are filled with papers of various materials. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of interviewee)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, not every school has enough funding for materials. Some materials also come from the land. The art teacher took the students to collect leaves, soil, discarded paper, old clothes, plastic bottles, etc. Every semester, children in Guinan consume tons of soil. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The art teacher became the leader of the main subject&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Zhang Yaoren once visited some rural schools in western Guangdong, and the proportion of left-behind children in these schools accounted for more than 60%. In a central primary school in a certain town, there are only 180 students. In the context of &quot;dismantling sites and merging schools&quot;, data from NetEase Digital shows that in the forty years from 1976 to 2016, 916,000 primary schools disappeared in China, and most of them were rural primary schools. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many art teachers who participated in the training confirmed this statement to Southern Weekend reporters. A rural teacher in Hengyang, Hunan told a Southern Weekend reporter with sadness that her rural primary school will be merged next semester. She came in a hurry from other places with great expectations in her heart, wanting to bring something new to the children in the village. After working for four years, she watched the number of students drop from more than one hundred to more than thirty. She is a little envious of physical education classes. Campus football education is a Hengyang specialty. Almost every primary school is equipped with a football field and guaranteed physical education class hours. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Luo Xiaohong, the head of the Zhejiang Zhipu Charity Foundation, known as &quot;Huabu&quot;, has been paying attention to the life growth of rural children and the mental health of children in distress for many years. She told Southern Weekend reporters that six years ago, In a county in a mountainous area, there is only one full-time art teacher in all 20 rural primary schools in the countryside. There has been some improvement over the years, but there are still problems that need to be solved urgently. For example, there are 13 establishments in schools with less than 200 students. “Obviously, this (class arrangement) cannot be arranged no matter how you arrange it.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In rural schools, &quot;one teacher uses many people to use it.&quot; &quot;I am now the class teacher in charge of the first grade, responsible for reading classes, labor and skill classes, and also responsible for the quality promotion of our school,&quot; a teacher told a Southern Weekend reporter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When visiting rural schools, Zhang Yaoren found that some teachers who graduated from normal art schools had been teaching their main subjects for more than ten years and no longer taught art, while the original teachers of Chinese, mathematics and other subjects taught part-time instead. Art, music and other courses. Some former art teachers have even become subject leaders of their main subjects, and they “always have some regrets in their hearts” when talking about it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2020, the General Office of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the General Office of the State Council issued the &quot;Opinions on Comprehensively Strengthening and Improving School Aesthetic Education in the New Era.&quot; The opinions proposed that aesthetic education should be included in the entire process of talent training in schools of all levels and types, and should run through all stages of school education. A post-80s teacher from a public primary school in western Hunan is one of the second batch of local art students. I have been teaching for thirteen years and have taught foreign language and math all over the place. In the past two years, the school responded to the aesthetic education policy, and she was able to return to her profession and become a full-time art teacher, making up for her regret at the time: &quot;It&#39;s not that art has no threshold, it&#39;s because they think it doesn&#39;t matter if they don&#39;t teach well and there will be no consequences.&quot;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;Art education has always been considered a &quot;minor subject&quot;. In many cases, the class hours of minor subjects are often &quot;occupied&quot; by the main subjects. Especially in primary schools with limited educational resources, it is more common for the main subject teachers to concurrently serve as the teachers of the minor subjects. The encroachment of the minor subject class hours is &quot;natural&quot;. &quot;Many documents on aesthetic education have been issued at the national level, and it cannot be said that they are not taken seriously. Art teachers like to take art classes, and students also fall in love with art classes, but in many cases they fail to take art classes.&quot; Luo Xiaohong felt heartbroken. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is another mystery in scheduling classes. According to the normal schedule, for example, a Chinese teacher has twelve classes and uses the original Chinese class hours; but in actual operation, a Chinese teacher is given six Chinese classes. The remaining six periods were replaced by art, physical education and other courses, and naturally all &quot;minor subjects&quot; were taken into Chinese language classes. According to Luo Xiaohong&#39;s observations in two counties in Zhejiang, the situation of &quot;two class schedules&quot; has been intensifying in the past two years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A private primary school art teacher comes from a county in Dali, Yunnan, and teaches a village primary school with 250 students. She told Southern Weekend reporters that when she came to Guinan School, she seemed to find a companion all of a sudden. For example, both choose two classes to form one big class. Her school does not take up art time, but in the public elementary school next door, the situation is completely different. &quot;Now there are exams and there are not enough class hours. The teacher has no choice but to do this in order to achieve results.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“What I painted twenty years ago, you are still painting”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporters saw at the teaching site that the art teachers who came for training experienced the Guinan experience in the studio The content of aesthetic education in the classroom: understanding materials-obtaining materials-production-teacher comments. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The level of rural teachers obviously varies. The first practical class involved hand-made books, and most of the teachers successfully completed the work. In the second period of the ink painting class, the quality of the teacher&#39;s ink paintings showed a certain difference. While creating, some teachers told Southern Weekend reporters that, in fact, they had not really touched ink for many years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to Guan Yong&#39;s request, an art teacher from Ankang, Shaanxi Province used three different kinds of paper to experience ink. He couldn&#39;t help but think of the students in class. Each student was given a brush, poured a little bit of ink, and asked them to apply it on the cardboard box and A4 paper. This was his best effort to let the students experience ink. If it is a handicraft class, paper cutting may be the simplest and most convenient. Many teachers told Southern Weekend reporters that the current main teaching format is drawing classes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The reality of rural resource constraints still exists. An art teacher in Huaihua, Hunan Province said that the school’s resources are scarce, and some art class materials even need to be purchased out of own pocket, costing almost 20,000 yuan. “It’s really impossible to do it. The classroom is empty, there is nothing, and the drawing board No, how to teach?&quot; Zhang Yaoren said that in the schools he contacted, students need to bring their own materials. If families cannot provide them, it will be difficult for the courses to continue. &quot;The pain of materials is a scar that has nowhere to hide in art courses.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/16/Hj47ESMSaP91n0rp7AvckUqLyRfBjsQmFyoeVrM1.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;720&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/16/Hj47ESMSaP91n0rp7AvckUqLyRfBjsQmFyoeVrM1.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250960&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;A fire hydrant at Guinan School decorated with student works. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern Weekend reporter Zhang Rui/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;We cannot ensure that every student gets an art book to take home.&quot; The above-mentioned teacher from Hengyang told Southern Weekend reporters that where she lives, even art textbooks are not widely available, and they can only use teaching materials in turns.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The above-mentioned rural teacher from Yunnan said that some teaching content involves high-rise buildings Buildings, zebra crossings, etc. Some rural children have never left the village and have only seen them on TV. &quot;Since high-rise buildings are drawn with lines and squares, we will transform the content and consider how to return to the teaching objectives.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/16/aq5KSZquk7pNJuHuzUjJUZccQX7cQXqiurpR8NNH.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;720&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/16/aq5KSZquk7pNJuHuzUjJUZccQX7cQXqiurpR8NNH.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250961&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Guinan School’s art studio decorates the walls with students’ paper-cutting work. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern Weekend reporter Zhang Rui/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In rural schools, having an art classroom may be a luxury. An art teacher from Shaanxi recalled that when he first came to school, the principal said to him that you were the only art teacher in the school, &quot;just take whatever you want.&quot; He felt his shoulders sink, but soon he realized that this might mean staying away from various competitions and honors. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The training program does not reject urban art teachers. Maybe their schools have excellent resources, but they are still confused about teaching methods. A young teacher from Beijing&#39;s Haidian District asked that the textbook content requires innovation, for example, asking students to color in triangles, but teachers are limited in what they can do. Guan Yong asked, why don&#39;t you make the triangle bigger? Why not design a giant triangle and let students color it freely? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This teacher born in the 1990s suddenly understood. He was born in a normal school majoring in art education, and now teaches at a key primary school in Haidian, responsible for courses from fourth to sixth grade. According to him, there are plenty of classes and resources, and there are no problems with rural teachers taking on concurrent jobs. The school’s art teachers have all received very good professional art training. &quot;The pressure on art teachers comes from the normalization of &#39;listening to and evaluating lessons&#39;.&quot; The above-mentioned young teacher said that another problem is that the two classes a week are often separated by several days, and the content of the teaching materials is trivial, and students&#39; learning is not systematic enough. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After reading the work, he commented that &quot;the children here (compared to the children in Beijing) are more active.&quot; Unlike many rural teachers who are surprised when they first see the campus, what he feels is not the art itself, but things other than art. At the scene, a teacher asked whether demonstrations should be conducted for children. This has been one of the teaching models for many years. Guan Yong stopped her. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;An art teacher in Chengzhong Village, Tianhe District, Guangzhou told Southern Weekend reporters that he is an art major and has always painted according to standards and learned painting formulas. When painting, the most important thing to consider is the formula. rather than expressing emotion. She pointed to the students&#39; works on the wall and said, &quot;The first feeling is that it is very free and unique.&quot; She recalled that her children attended the top ten middle schools in the district and participated in the school&#39;s interest classes. As a result, the content and mode of learning were no different from when she was a child. &quot;What I drew twenty years ago, you are still drawing.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Art is a pinch of salt&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Guinan has no internal evaluation activities and rarely participates in peripheral art competitions. Zhang Yaoren explained that the core of art works is self-expression and inner feelings. How can this be scored? And when you look at the works in those competitions, you can often see traces of teacher intervention. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A few years ago, Zhang Yaoren wanted to design a logo. In the folk studio, he saw a monkey-style print. This print later became the logo. In accordance with the collection standards, Guan Yong specially made a beautiful collection certificate with the author&#39;s name and the title of the work on it. During the flag-raising ceremony, the certificate was awarded to the child and a bonus was given. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/16/I1BvI5zZPXHpe53okfU9YdjzV0MHq6UiQ4mf1FVA.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/16/I1BvI5zZPXHpe53okfU9YdjzV0MHq6UiQ4mf1FVA.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250962&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Guinan School Art Museum, where creative materials and student works are stored. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern Weekend reporter Zhang Rui/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;As ordinary people, if they can be nourished by beauty, I believe their lives will be better. &quot;So it&#39;s different,&quot; Zhang Yaoren said, &quot;He might keep his house clean and try to take good care of his family; she might pick a handful of wild flowers from the field and put them on the table to turn a plain meal into a new one. It has to be slightly different...&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When Guinan School held a rural children&#39;s art biennial, a student at the University of Pennsylvania in the United States researched and established a data model to analyze the impact of art education on migrant children. . After analyzing the effects of the first round, a positive conclusion was drawn. Zhang Yaoren is reluctant to utilitarianize and digitize the results to demonstrate the relationship between art and academic performance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He often said that art is a handful of salt, and life needs a little spice. As for the potential and influence of aesthetic education, Zhang Yaoren does not consider these and does not care. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Art should always be about education, not works. School teachers have students’ work observations, and teachers observe and record students’ behaviors, habits, emotions, etc. in the classroom. For example, in the &quot;Final Summary Art Classroom Observation Diary&quot;, an observation diary written in the second semester of the 2020-2021 school year, each student is recorded in terms of classroom performance, regular habits, and presentation of works. One student did not perform well. A teacher wrote: &quot;In the future classroom, I will try to find a creative method suitable for this kind of children.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At least from the perspective of some outsiders, occupying art classes, increasing learning time, and improving The enrollment rate is the key to changing the fate of migrant children. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Shi Lei, the principal of Guinan School, has been thinking about a question since 2017: Who are the people closest to us? &quot;Chefs, waiters, repairmen, cleaners, etc. In real life, our feelings come from them.&quot; Shi Lei said, &quot;Our students have a probability of becoming them. This is a very real problem.&quot; According to statistics, the school only has 35 % of students will enter high school, while the remaining students will enter technical secondary schools, vocational schools, etc. What if they have different feelings about life? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Shi Lei told Southern Weekend reporters that over more than five years, the school has successively invested millions of yuan to renovate classrooms, build art galleries, buy materials, etc., and reduce the school’s enrollment scale from 2000 to 2008. The number of students has dropped to about 1,200, and tuition fees are low, so the school is losing money almost every year. Some of his colleagues came to the school to criticize him and went to see a doctor if he had a mental problem. &quot;(They don&#39;t understand) Will this help me raise my tuition fees or help me recruit more students?&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is difficult to &quot;copy&quot; Guinan-style art education. Guan Yong contacted some schools in Zhuhai and almost reached the final stage, but gave up due to teacher objections. Guan Yong recalled that the teachers were unwilling to do it because they thought it would increase the workload but bring no additional income. He took the initiative to teach, but the teachers did not agree. &quot;It&#39;s so commonplace,&quot; Guan Yong said, &quot;If you don&#39;t do it, just leave.&quot; Luo Xiaohong told Southern Weekend reporters that they had donated brushes, paints, etc. to some rural schools, but after a few years, the things were still stored there. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;If you understand our students, you will only do more.&quot; Shi Lei said that the children of migrant workers live a busy and unstable life, and lack opportunities to relieve their emotions under the pressure of life. Would life be better if there was one more outlet in a very compact life? After nine years of reading tens of thousands of works, will the aesthetics of life improve? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Shi Lei grew up in a school for the children of a factory. He had contact with many good art teachers and music teachers since he was a child. After a few years, he forgot all his knowledge other than language and mathematics, but he remembered the art classes and music classes in the past, and his life was also different. Thanks to the abundant gifts at that time. &quot;Others see that we have done a lot of works and painted a lot of paintings, but these are the least important in our hearts,&quot; Shi Lei said, &quot;We are not doing this for this thing, what is really important is the process of aesthetic education. ”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 16 Sep 2023 19:25:05 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[癌症晚期旅客登机被拒：航空公司宁担非议背后的考量是什么？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256858]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-16 18:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Recently, a civil aviation news incident has attracted attention. On September 12, 2023, a passenger with terminal cancer booked a Chengdu Airlines ticket at Chengdu Tianfu International Airport but was refused boarding, which attracted public attention. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As can be seen in the video, an old man is sitting in a wheelchair, while another man and the old lady are sitting on the ground and calling airline customer service. The man cried and said, &quot;Nothing is allowed to let me leave. I signed the commitment myself and brought a caregiver with me. Why don&#39;t you let me leave?&quot; Then the man added, &quot;I have cancer. Four months. You said before that if you don&#39;t have heart disease, respiratory disease, or trauma, it&#39;s fine.&quot; The family finally knelt on the ground and begged. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Afterwards, Chengdu Airlines staff responded that the passenger was indeed a terminal cancer patient, and the company has clear regulations not to carry such patients to prevent passengers from becoming unwell during the flight. This regulation is publicized in the &quot;General Conditions of Transport&quot; on the official website. If you are a cancer patient in the early or middle stages, there is no absolute restriction on passengers taking the flight. Netizens&#39; opinions are also polarized. Some netizens said that the airline is impersonal and has &quot;overlord clauses&quot; that &quot;discriminate against passengers.&quot; However, some netizens expressed understanding. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This incident has come to an end, but there are still some issues worthy of analysis. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Firstly, airlines deny boarding to passengers with terminal cancer for safety reasons. Article 6.1.3 of the &quot;General Conditions of Carriage&quot; on the official website of Chengdu Airlines states, &quot;Passengers with the following diseases will not be transported unless special arrangements are made with Chengdu Airlines&#39; consent.&quot; Paragraph 10 of this article refers to &quot;patients with terminal cancer.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, not only Chengdu Airlines is &quot;not allowed to carry&quot;, but all major domestic airlines also have similar or similar regulations. For example, Air China lists in the general conditions of transportation, &quot;Large vertical septum&quot; &quot;Patients with tumors, extremely large hernias and intestinal obstructions&quot; will not be provided with air transportation services unless agreed or with special arrangements; China Eastern Airlines also states in the &quot;Service Instructions for Sick Passengers&quot; that for &quot;patients with large mediastinal tumors, extremely large hernias&quot; and patients with intestinal obstruction&quot;, it is recommended not to choose to fly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It can be seen that Chengdu Airlines is not the only airline that &quot;targets&quot; sick passengers. To be more precise, similar regulations of airlines fall into the category of &quot;rejection of transportation and restriction of transportation&quot;. Although the specific regulations of major airlines are different, the principle behind them is the same: airlines cannot guarantee that they can effectively protect and ensure the safety of passengers during the transportation process. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Revere regulations, revere life&quot; is by no means an empty phrase in the field of civil aviation. Behind every seemingly strange regulation, there are safety accidents, large and small, and bloody lives as a reminder. For passengers with advanced cancer or special diseases, changes in air pressure and oxygen concentration will pose a great threat to life, and there is a potential risk of sudden illness requiring rescue. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, not only passengers with special diseases are not suitable for boarding, but also pregnant women who are 32 weeks or more than 36 weeks pregnant are not suitable for boarding. They require medical permission and diagnosis certificate to board with restrictions. This takes into account the potential health risks of pregnant women during flights. By extension, people suffering from cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases are not suitable for riding roller coasters, and the elderly, weak, sick and young are not suitable for participating in extreme sports such as diving and mountain climbing. This is not a &quot;denial of service&quot; or &quot;discrimination against consumers&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Therefore, the passengers in this incident are more suitable to travel by high-speed rail or car. This can avoid the health risks caused by changes in air pressure and oxygen concentration during flight, and it is easier to get timely information during the trip. medical services. After all, it is much easier to get off the high-speed train or car to see a doctor than to find a doctor while flying. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Secondly, airlines deny boarding to passengers with terminal cancer, which itself reflects the relationship of equal rights and responsibilities between airlines and passengers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this incident, the &quot;letter of commitment&quot; proposed by the parties concerned attracted more attention. Some netizens believed that since the passengers had &quot;signed and promised to bear all the consequences themselves,&quot; it would be inappropriate for the airline to still refuse to board the plane. Although this statement seems reasonable, it ignores the current laws and the actual situation of civil aviation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In terms of civil relations, airlines are just commercial institutions that provide transportation services. Their contractual obligation is to safely transport passengers to their destinations by aircraft; passengers purchase transportation services that meet the face value and do not Healthcare that goes beyond face value. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If passengers with terminal cancer are allowed to board the plane, the airline may not be able to bear the corresponding risks, and the potential costs required will be far greater than the revenue from this single ticket business, including but not limited to passenger accidents Death, flight turning back after a passenger becomes ill, etc. I would like to ask, once the plane is forced to make a temporary diversion or turn back, who will compensate other passengers for the resulting loss of rights and interests? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Civil aviation aircraft are not special-purpose &quot;medical aircraft&quot; and do not have the conditions for &quot;airborne ICU&quot;. Once a sick passenger encounters an emergency and requires medical treatment during the flight, it may be an additional task that the airline is unable to handle and has no obligation to handle. Whether a passenger dies or the plane is forced to turn back in an emergency, the total losses suffered by all parties will undoubtedly be much greater. A &quot;letter of commitment to bear the consequences&quot; that may not be legally binding cannot persuade airlines to ignore possible risks and bear huge potential costs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Therefore, the airline&#39;s refusal to board passengers with terminal cancer is not so much &quot;discrimination&quot; with a more positive or negative meaning, but rather &quot;differential treatment&quot; based on specific circumstances. This &quot;differential treatment&quot; not only shows respect for the safety of passengers&#39; lives and property, but also demonstrates the principle of &quot;equivalence of rights and responsibilities&quot;. Airlines and passengers are both civil subjects, and their rights and obligations are completely equal. Airlines have the right to refuse service to passengers who exceed their obligations and capabilities. Passengers can also choose other air service providers who are willing to take greater risks, or other means of transportation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 16 Sep 2023 18:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[一块钱酸梅汤打败“入秋第一杯奶茶”，网红中药能刷医保吗？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256723]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-16 17:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 16 Sep 2023 17:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[旧房换新房，能否激活淄博楼市？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256841]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-16 16:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/ image/23/09/15/97064ca1ac.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;2048&quot; height=&quot;1366&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/ 15/97064ca1ac.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250933&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;April 10, 2023, Qisheng Lake Park, Zibo, Shandong . (Visual China/Picture)&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;These days, some staff from local government departments always call Li Bin to ask him about the &quot;trade-in&quot; method of buying a house in Zibo. mode and specific operating procedures. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On September 6, 2023, the Zibo Real Estate Development Association and the Municipal Real Estate Brokerage and Appraisal Association jointly launched a signing ceremony for the &quot;old-for-new&quot; home purchase, with the first batch of 12 companies Representatives of real estate development companies and real estate brokerage agencies signed cooperation agreements. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;According to &quot;Zibo Daily&quot;, &quot;old for new&quot; means exchanging old houses for new ones. Real estate development companies and real estate brokerage agencies join forces to speed up the sales of existing housing. Real estate companies give priority to providing high-quality housing to meet the replacement needs of home buyers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;However, there is still a lot of speculation in the market about the specific method of &quot;trade-in&quot;. On the short video platform, some people interpreted that Zibo’s “old-for-new” policy for home purchases this time allows the appraisal agency to “give the money after the old house has been appraised to the home buyer, and the home buyer will then use the money to buy a new home.”&lt;/p >; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Trading old for new&quot; was the earliest housing sales model tried by Beike. On September 13, as the deputy general manager of Shell (Shandong) Internet Co., Ltd., Li Bin clarified to Southern Weekend reporters: When the original customer replaced, if the second-hand house he lived in before could not be sold, he would not have the funds on hand to buy a new house. Deposit. The current &quot;old-for-new&quot; model requires developers, intermediaries and customers to sign an agreement. According to the agreement, after the customer pays the deposit, the developer will give the customer 90-180 days to sell the house and reserve the customer&#39;s favorite house; The intermediary also promotes clients’ second-hand houses on the platform. If the customer&#39;s house is still not sold after the agreement period, the deposit will be refunded. &quot;The core of &#39;trade-in&#39; old for new&#39; is to shorten the replacement cycle between new and second-hand houses.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image /23/09/15/56104f158b.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;2048&quot; height=&quot;1434&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/15 /56104f158b.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250934&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Local Government Concerned about the decommissioning of new houses&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In Shandong, Jinan City was the first to launch the &quot;old-for-new&quot; policy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In July 2023, the Shandong Real Estate Association and the Jinan Real Estate Association held a seminar on the &quot;Real Estate Market Situation in the First Half of the Year&quot;. In addition to the member units of the Shandong Real Estate Association and the Jinan Real Estate Association, the meeting was also attended by the Shandong Provincial Department of Housing and Urban-Rural Development, the Finance and Economics Office of the Provincial Party Committee, the Jinan Municipal Housing and Urban-Rural Development Bureau and some financial institutions. Li Bin remembers that that meeting was the starting point for the debut of &quot;old for new&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;It was recognized by some developers in Jinan at that time.&quot; Li Bin said that in late August, &quot;old for new&quot; began to be piloted in some projects in Jinan. Taking a project of a real estate company as an example, Beike provides home buyers with second-hand house evaluation, listing, inspection and transaction services. For second-hand houses that meet transaction standards, Beike will help customers sell their houses quickly within 30-90 days; the project team Provide 1%-2% home purchase subsidies to buyers of second-hand houses to speed up the sales of second-hand houses. Among them, buyers of first-hand houses can lock in the house they want by paying 100,000 yuan, and then pay for the new house after the second-hand house is sold. If the second-hand house is not sold, they can enjoy check-out guarantee. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Li Bin remembered that at a real estate brokerage seminar held in Zibo in August, staff from the relevant administrative departments in Zibo also expressed their opinions on this &quot;old-for-new&quot; housing buying and selling model. I was very interested and suggested that Zibo&#39;s industry associations could also try to promote it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;The core method is to shorten the transaction time between new homes and second homes, and the government plays a supporting and encouraging role in this.&quot; Li Bin introduced. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Zhuge housing search data shows that from January to July 2023, the price of new houses in Zibo continued to climb, rising from 8,272 yuan/square meter to 8,425 yuan/square meter. But the price dropped to 8,389 yuan/square meter in August. In contrast, Zibo&#39;s second-hand housing prices have been rising month after month, and since November 2022, there has been an inversion of primary and second-hand housing prices. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Li Bin explained to Southern Weekend reporters that &quot;replacing old houses with new ones&quot; requires accelerating the disposal of second-hand houses and at the same time making a good connection with the replacement of new houses. If the second-hand house in the hands of the home buyer cannot be sold, he will not have the down payment for the new house, and he will not be able to make the decision to buy a new house. &quot;Data shows that the average transaction cycle for second-hand houses in Jinan City is now 175 days, and even more than 250 days in Zibo.&quot; In smaller cities and counties, the transaction cycle for second-hand houses will be longer. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Li Bin introduced that the &quot;old-for-new&quot; policy for buying houses will be implemented in many cities in Shandong such as Tai&#39;an and Jining. In addition to Shandong, some cities outside the province also want to learn about relevant experiences. Li Bin found that the local governments who came to communicate would be more concerned about the sale of new houses. “After all, the sale of new houses is the most important means for cities to activate the real estate market.” &lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;There are more people waiting and watching&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;September 8, &quot;Zibo Daily&quot; More than 40 first-hand properties with &quot;old-for-new&quot; agreements were announced. However, several local real estate agents in Zibo told Southern Weekend reporters that more people who want to buy a house are still waiting and watching. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Zhang Yuan (pseudonym), a real estate agent in Zibo City, told Southern Weekend reporters that after the introduction of the &quot;old for new&quot; policy, the number of people viewing houses has increased significantly, more than before. One-third, his daily working hours also increased from the original 12 hours to 14 hours. He said that if the agent fails to sell the old house within the three months stipulated in the agreement, the client will take back the old house and the deposit, which is &quot;equivalent to three months of work in vain.&quot; Zhang Yuan explained that the policy will bring greater workload to the intermediary, but if the client is sure to sell the old house, he will have more confidence to buy a new house. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Another Zibo real estate agent, Sun Yu (pseudonym), updated his policy interpretation on the short video platform on September 8. In addition, he receives twenty or thirty related consultation calls every day. There are people who are in a hurry to sell their old house and buy a new one and ask more than a dozen questions at once, while there are also people who inquire casually and take a wait-and-see attitude. Sun Yu told Southern Weekend reporters that developers of large real estate projects generally do not accept old houses. “If he (the developer) wants to sell new houses, why would he buy second-hand houses?” As for intermediaries, they are generally willing to represent large-property houses. , that is, houses where the owner owns the house and can produce a real estate certificate, &quot;the sales difficulty is low and the transaction rate is higher.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Sun Yu said that the second-hand houses for sale in his hands are mainly located in Zhangdian West District, the main urban area of ​​Zibo, which is also what the intermediary calls Zibo&#39;s &quot;prime location.&quot; The highest price here exceeds 20,000 yuan per square meter, while in the suburbs with the lowest prices, one square meter sells for only 5,000 to 6,000 yuan, which is a quarter of the price in the central city. &quot;The first-hand properties participating in the &#39;trade-in&#39; program are not very easy to sell,&quot; Sun Yu said. Most of them are located in the suburbs of Zibo with relatively poor locations, and the number of houses in the school district is relatively small. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;But there are already customers who have successfully &quot;traded in old products for new ones&quot; with Sun Yu. This is a 35-year-old customer. He needs to sell his old house in the eastern part of Zhangdian District before he can have enough budget to buy a house in a school district. Previously, this old house had been listed on the trading platform for nearly half a year without any interest. In the past few days, Sun Yu sold the client&#39;s old house for 800,000 yuan, and the client spent more than 1.5 million yuan to buy a school district house in the southwest area of ​​Zhangdian. In Sun Yu&#39;s opinion, this is one of the best-located houses in the first-hand real estate that participates in the &quot;old-for-new&quot; project. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Sun Yu currently opens his own real estate agency in Zibo, with more than a dozen employees, and his business focuses on the sale of first-hand and second-hand houses. He said that the current policy has not brought significant changes in sales volume to the company. In 2023, the company&#39;s monthly housing sales will mainly be concentrated in 3 to 5 units. The New Deal has led to more people consulting, &quot;but everyone is very cautious, and there are more people waiting and watching.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 16 Sep 2023 16:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[当“知心闺蜜”恶语相向之前：李佳琦这样的“赛博货郎”何以逆势成功？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256854]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-16 15:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Recently, &quot;the most powerful beauty blogger&quot; Li Jiaqi angrily criticized consumers in the live broadcast room, which caused Li Jiaqi himself has been caught in the whirlpool of public opinion. Even after he apologized in tears, the criticism and accusations against him have not subsided. In addition to pushing him to the forefront of public opinion, this storm has also focused the public&#39;s attention on In the industry of &quot;carrying anchor&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before getting involved in this verbal controversy, Li Jiaqi had built an astonishing business empire through years of hard work in the field of beauty live streaming. The total sales of his short video platform live broadcast room in one month exceeded &quot;Shocking records&quot; such as 1 billion yuan and 15,000 lipsticks sold in 5 minutes have even triggered communication scholars to study its sales discourse system and communication strategies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Judging from the main consumer portraits, Li Jiaqi mainly targets female audiences, which can be seen from his iconic opening remarks &quot;all girls&quot; during his live broadcast. In addition to the skilled symbolic use of &quot;girlfriend accents&quot; such as &quot;Your devil is here&quot;, &quot;Oh my god&quot;, &quot;It&#39;s so pretty&quot;, &quot;Buy it, buy it&quot;, Li Jiaqi is also very good at using hierarchical contrast communication strategies. Through &quot;lifting and stepping on&quot;, we create a &quot;superior&quot; consumption satisfaction for consumers. For example, when describing the lipstick brand as &quot;rustic&quot;, Li Jiaqi would use rhetorical methods such as &quot;the color my mother painted twenty years ago&quot; to awaken consumers&#39; memories. When recommending their own products, they will use rhetorical means such as &quot;You are the peach in the world&quot;, &quot;You will be a lady if you paint it&quot;, &quot;Limited edition of XX color&quot;, etc. to provide female consumers with room for imagination and inspire them. Consumer impulse to place a single trial. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Consumers, mainly female, are willing to spend money in Li Jiaqi’s live broadcast room not only because of their recognition and affirmation of the professional ability of his “lipstick brother”, but also because of his “close friend” trust and favor. Similarly, what female consumers buy in Li Jiaqi’s live broadcast room is not only lipstick and eyebrow pencil, but also emotional value. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So the cause and result of the &quot;censorship incident&quot; are actually very simple. For anchors, under the pressure of the stock game and the economic downturn, even Li Jiaqi, who is precise and proficient in the &quot;girlfriend accent&quot; and &quot;the best understanding of women&#39;s hearts&quot;, has perfect head anchors to mobilize consumers&#39; consumption impulses. Times are not as easy as before, and the resulting fatigue and irritability are themselves a natural reflection of the economic and social environment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For consumers, it is emotionally difficult for consumers to have their “best friends” who have flattered and flattered them in the past and provided full emotional value regardless of whether they consume or not, suddenly lower their faces and say nasty things to them. Accepted. Although Li Jiaqi often calls and describes consumers as &quot;princess&quot;, &quot;lady&quot; and &quot;queen&quot;, in fact, his main consumer groups are still mainly working-class people. They are commonly known as &quot;workers&quot; and are involved in workplace pressure. When I was exhausted and tried to find emotional value in the live broadcast room of my &quot;best friend&quot;, I was accused of &quot;not trying hard&quot; by the other party. It is also a normal emotional reaction to get angry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It can be said that the &quot;censorship incident&quot; was actually an instant hedging of the common emotions between Li Jiaqi and consumers under pressure. But Li Jiaqi and consumers are not the only ones under pressure. At a time when &quot;it&#39;s not easy for everyone to make money,&quot; the way for &quot;Li Jiaqi&quot; to make money seems too easy, so the &quot;censorship incident&quot; has become an outlet for that pressure. While the public used this incident to vent their stress and emotions, they also began to think about how &quot;goods anchors&quot; have become an &quot;easy to make money&quot; industry in our society. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, Li Jiaqi’s role in the entire beauty industry chain is more similar to that of a salesman selling needles, thread, and cosmetics boxes in pre-modern society. He is neither a producer of goods nor a businessman who opens a store to do business in the traditional sense, but a more special kind of sales terminal. In the old society, due to the restrictions of etiquette, women could neither move around nor obtain information about goods. These housewives, who had limited information and limited knowledge, needed the medium of a salesman to understand and purchase goods. Therefore, in ancient society, a successful salesman must be a person who is familiar with women&#39;s psychological characteristics, masters certain speaking skills, and can speak into women&#39;s hearts. A ballad in the old society sang like this:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Salesman Son, selling flower thread, carrying a load on the street. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Jingle bell shakes to call the girl, and leads her to meet her at the door. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The girl should smile and be angry again, and the price should be cheap and the goods should be new. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fortunately, the salesman is blessed with beauty and often has sex with beauties in his life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It can be seen that modern &quot;beauty anchors&quot; are in the same vein as the ancient salesmen selling needle threads and cosmetics boxes in terms of understanding the psychological characteristics of consumers, formulating targeted marketing strategies, and matching the emotional value of sales. It is precisely because of this characteristic that there was widespread prejudice and discrimination against the profession of peddlers in the old society. It was believed that they behaved improperly and would seduce women whenever they had the opportunity. In Ming and Qing dynasty novels, there were many peddlers who seduced, abducted and trafficked women. The story of a good woman. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From the perspective of business development form theory, peddlers in the old society were the product of poor business information in a closed and semi-closed &quot;acquaintance society&quot; environment. In the information age, there are various sales channels and sales methods, open product information is readily available, and various product advertisements are overwhelming. In this environment, there should be no living space for &quot;cyber peddlers&quot;, at least other It should not occupy such an important position and proportion in modern business activities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But reality is exactly the opposite of theory. The &quot;cyber gangsters&quot; represented by Li Jiaqi have not only bucked the trend and achieved great success in the modern information society, but also work part-time with &quot;Internet celebrities&quot; in some other countries. The business model of carrying goods is different. In my country, &quot;cyber hawkers&quot; have developed into a specialized profession and formed a large professional group, becoming the most important and powerful sales channel and method of online e-commerce. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the world&#39;s largest manufacturing country, the world&#39;s largest informatization country, and the world&#39;s largest online retail country, consumers&#39; consumption habits have returned to a certain extent to the &quot;hawker model&quot; of pre-modern society. , there are actually very profound reasons behind this counter-intuitive, counter-logical, and counter-intuitive reality. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First of all, it is precisely because of the huge abundance of products, the explosive growth of product information, and the seamless coverage of product advertisements that consumers in the ocean of products and information feel confused and confused. . At the same time, the cost of &quot;trial and error&quot; has also increased exponentially, and consumers who are unwilling to delve into relevant knowledge and compare the pros and cons of similar products in order to buy a product will naturally return to &quot;acquaintances&quot; in another sense. Society&quot;, that is, choosing to trust the &quot;enthusiastic recommendations&quot; of the &quot;cyber peddlers&quot; you like. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Secondly, the information society certainly has its noisy and bustling side, but behind the information explosion, surging public opinion, and all-weather socialization, the spiritual loneliness of atomized individuals on the Internet is also a serious problem. As mentioned earlier, what Li Jiaqi, the &quot;cyber salesman&quot; provides, is not just lipstick and eyebrow pencil, but also emotional value. Perhaps, the latter is more important than the former in determining the role of the ancient profession of &quot;salesman&quot; in this modern information age. A broad and permanent living space in the commercial society. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 16 Sep 2023 15:25:03 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[林家栋：要把角色的灵魂、内心抓出来]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256835]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-16 14:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/13/OugasTfNJ5ML9yNbtsKg8Ese6jTVvmFQwr4ZgUOK.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/OugasTfNJ5ML9yNbtsKg8Ese6jTVvmFQ wr4ZgUOK. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250583&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>; (Visual China/Picture) &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2019, police officer Wang Shouyue retired in Guangdong.

Wang Shouyue could not bear the noise of construction at the construction site and went to the construction company to report the situation. Chen Xinwen and several others were studying the drawings. Wang Shouyue thought they were studying real estate development, but in fact they were plotting to rob. That was a few days before the shocking case occurred more than 20 years ago. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I don&#39;t know what you will do next, and you don&#39;t know what I will do next, so outside of the camera, we keep a sense of distance.&quot; Lin Jiadong said.

&lt;p>;导演杜琪峰的《黑社会》（&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;2005&lt;/span>;）演技派云集，任达华、梁家辉、林雪、张家辉，没有盖掉林家栋的闪光处。在帮会和连胜交接之年，年轻一辈争夺权力。林家栋饰演的东莞仔效忠其中一派，听话、手狠，野心逐渐膨胀。影迷开始认可他。很快，《叶问》（&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;2008&lt;/span>;）里的汉奸李钊一角让林家栋拿到香港电影金像奖（&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;“以下简称金像奖”&lt;/span>;）最佳男配角提名。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/sepyjFDz5nBfX5DhRUB7nlA43arTY2X1K4i8E3fg.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;533&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/sepyjFDz5nBfX5DhRUB7nlA43arTY2X1K4i8E3fg.jpg&quot;

&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/bgR83OjJYp2oQWymrd1m26vKCXFEnubavG0JtX1D.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/bgR83OjJYp2oQWymrd1m26vKCXFEnubavG0JtX1D.jpg&quot;

&lt;p>;林家栋也演过面慈但冷血的匪。凭借淡漠的贼王，他同时获得香港电影金像奖、香港电影评论学会、香港电影导演会影帝。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/npjwyFz4FWkI6toJ9VmpUmau97eTgt5bT0KVEMQh.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;

text-align: center;&quot;>;《智齿》(2021)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2022年，他凭《手卷烟》和《智齿》两部电影获得两个金像奖最佳男主角提名。其中《手卷烟》他以零片酬出演，饰演被社会遗弃的人：他的角色关超二十多年前是华裔英兵，退役后生活失意，欠高利贷，做黑社会两头吃的营生，收留了一个被追杀的落难印度人，最后自己身犯险境。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;林家栋今年56岁，他这几年的银幕形象，从关超到王守月，有郁郁衰老之态。但他本人保养得宜，身形瘦削。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;9月初的一个晚上，9点多，忙了一天的工作，林家栋讲起表演，兴致依然高涨，比如《命案》（&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;2023&lt;/span>;）片尾天台戏他的自由发挥，让他饰演的命理大师在人格分裂后喃喃自语：“我是一支花，我是一支花。”比如《手卷烟》里关超对待印度人前后态度的微妙转变，是由于对方称呼的改变。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;他记性极佳，能迅速回忆起《黑社会》最后一场戏，野心上身的东莞仔对台词气口的处理。他不时加上肢体动作，还原自己一个人关在房间苦苦琢磨的样子：在沙发上瘫下来，半个小时，再坐起身，做出翻看剧本状，找突破口。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;王守月是个无聊的人，好容易退休了，生活还是过得像工作，这可能有点像林家栋。他上过许多次TVB或者其他电视访谈节目，都说自己这个人没意思，无聊得很。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;他是勤奋的演员，哪怕拿了影帝，也说只能“嗨48小时”，然后会想工作。那年，握着奖杯，他在台上对自己说，冷静点。然后说，“这么多年我自己觉得，演戏真的是不分年纪的。也不计较颜值，最重要是自己用心。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;以下是林家栋的讲述：&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;警察的感情&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;我想王守月这个角色有点不一样，过去我看很多警匪片对警察的描述，没有太多表现感情，但这一次我觉得是很好的机会，这个角色是有情的人。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;第一场在退休饭局，我其实有一些压抑、遗憾，二十多年，（嫌疑人）看不到，抓不住，怎么办？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;到后来我跟大鹏这个角色对冲，慢慢了解他，他是做错了一个决定的可怜人。看到他在火灾现场的新闻短片，不是太光鲜的，所以我要亲眼看看他现在什么样，应该过得不太好吧？能不能把他抓回来、用什么方法，我不知道。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;办公室那场戏，人物矛盾还没有出现。我的处理是随着身体语言，去给他们压力：返回来-停住-走，聊，再回头，巴拉巴拉，这样子。我觉得可以这样处理，已经足够，如果太多情感就假了，你根本不晓得他们是谁，他也不晓得你是谁，如果我想通过画面让观众感受压力，身体语言做这个反应就够了。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;每次演出前，我习惯先看看这里的场景，适应我的身份、情绪，我跟里面其他人物的关系。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;我必须要尊重导演跟摄影师的风格。有的导演、摄影师，是用镜头帮忙做了很多事，不需要我做太多，在拍摄现场我就配合你。但如果是定镜，你让我走，那么摄影机的镜头在这里，空间那么大，我在这个空间能做多少，尽量做。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;感性与清醒&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;演员在镜头之内很感性，镜头外我们应该很清醒。我每天都记住，我见过什么人、聊什么天，我会问不同理念的朋友，对新移民什么感觉？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;每个行业都有不同的人存在，我想感受他们的生命力在哪里。每一次放假，我都找一些圈外的朋友聊天，有做水产服务、开的士、卖钻石、做大品牌公关的，也有做老板的，在中环做金融的。我的朋友大部分很能说，多听，我就明白原来他们的生活圈、思维、共同态度是这个样子。他们的人生满足了我。我慢慢累积，内置我的经验，将来演出，我知道得很具体。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;比如很多大公司裁员，老是裁最一线的人，你经理一个月的人工费够10个人的，裁你一个就够了，但很多公司是将军多过兵，为什么那么奇怪呢？这就涉及到人性的问题，人一定是要保护自己的。但是将军少了10个兵，又怎么打仗？生活中真的有太多的问题。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;《寒战》里本来我是反派。我跟导演说，我演反一号很开心，但是对你的电影是很大的破坏。现实里，一个大公司的管理层，要生存，不光是看能力有多强，忍耐最重要。不能够太过，要懂得收。 Albert是法律博士，学历特别高，不可能被彭于晏那个角色笼络的。两个礼拜后，导演真的改了，让我的角色最后死掉了，我反而开心。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;我年少的时候很少说话的，家里全都是姐姐在说，姐姐也不明白男生的想法，我们很少交流。但是我每天看很多东西，脑袋里也在想，为什么这样？去喜宴，穿黑色的西装。朋友了，去殡仪馆，也是黑色的西装，那怎么分是红事还是白事？很多为什么。后来读训练班，老师也告诉我们，生活是体验，你们必须要记住这个感觉。就更加特意去想，看多一点，多想一点，为人物的性格找一个根源，将来创作就更有理有据。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;我跟朋友很无聊的，夜里1点多肚子饿，问在哪里，吃夜宵好不好？茶餐厅最好，吃喝有中有西的。外带，不需要。进去坐，吃什么，看（这时候自己）胖不胖。不胖的话，我最喜欢吃番茄酱的粉，胖就不可以了，喝奶茶或者咖啡。我和朋友叫一个套餐，吃的给你，我喝这个就可以，不浪费。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;茶餐厅是一个很真实的地方，没有那么多的枷锁。在酒店，每个人都很静的，说什么不知道(模拟窃窃私语)，看不到情感。茶餐厅有很实在的生活在里面，人很愿意表露他们的情绪，可以了解到一点八卦。这个样子最舒服。我现在也去。要做山上的人不难，把自己封闭起来；但生活很重要，感受生活很重要，要不然怎么演出？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/gyGjrnRLSWDVdFArYwioQoc7oOLyCVEKigrDKXXL.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;543&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/gyGjrnRLSWDVdFArYwioQoc7oOLyCVEKigrDKXXL.jpg&quot;

&lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;《无间道》（最后那场戏）演之前我吓了一跳。刘德华刘伟强你们骗我，为什么我要开枪打陈永仁？ ok，给我一分钟。他们肯定很清楚这个剧本，我对角色只有那一点点认识，其他我都不知道，所以必须要相信他们。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;但必须承认，剪完之后，看成片我是可以接受的。人最多的是什么东西？面具，面对不同的场景、不同的人物，人会戴着不同的面具，这是我从那场戏领悟出来的。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;（至于表演上的质变）我想应该是在《黑社会》到《叶问》。观众之前看我就是一个斯文小子。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/aTINtflx8n06v4KPhj2AsJnuIePMQJ1XPKlWVwhq.jpg&quot;

&lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;我们也不可以看playback（回放），只有导演能看。群戏只有一两场，其他时候没有对手，只有我自己一个人演。所以我真的没有太多的想法。在电影院看，我才想到，原来表演可以这个样子的吗？原来创作变化是那么大的，编剧跟导演很了解我们这些演员，能够把我们改到一个程度，让观众有很新、但是很实在的感觉。我觉得很厉害，影响我很深。那我应该还有机会，我不甘于就是现在这样子。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;到《叶问》是第一次，那个戏还没开拍，我到上海，躲在房间里头三天三夜，没有出房间吃饭，我的助理把饭拿来放门口，像住监狱一样。过三天就拍了，我想，应该怎么处理这个人物，就这点空间，能够表达李钊这个人物的无奈。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;李钊是汉奸，做汉奸是不好的，但我跟导演说，我（指李钊）不在北京、不在南京，看不见权力问题，我在佛山，钱真的不多，要生存。有一场戏，演对手戏的角色死掉了，我根本没有想过人要为一包米死掉，打打无所谓，受伤也算了——那个时代没办法，但死好像是过分一点了。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;拍的时候，因为导演没有喊cut，我做了一个很长的反应。我要求导演让我做长一点，哪怕后面剪掉也无所谓。那个时候我开始知道，要把角色的灵魂、内心抓出来。还好洪金宝导演说可以做。 Thanks. 《叶问》有机会、有镜头、有时间让我做。我再通过这个镜头告诉观众，李钊，你难过吗？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;先想一想&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;一个戏拍完，我会让自己变空白。我带一个电脑到外地去，可以一整天不出去，在房间看、想，因为我已经进入另外一个角色里头，过去了的就不想了。如果老是想过去很容易卡住。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;我不把它当作一个工作，这是我的兴趣。有的时候导演打电话问：你在公司里头吗？ “在。”“最近怎么样？我想到一个案子，你觉得怎么样？”“有趣啊。”“那我过两天带编剧过来找你谈谈。”“好。”就这样。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;比如最近，有一个投资方，他不是找我演出的，他说现在香港的电影真的困难，他希望做有内容的限级片。我想一想，可以这样、那样。他说，“你帮我当监制可以吗？可以来跟导演聊聊。”接着投资方找我演出，我想应该很好玩的样子，就跟他合作了。现在项目还在创作阶段。大家觉得香港电影可能题材越来越少，我希望能够通过我自己的一点点努力，得到多一点空间，让观众看不同的题材。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;《手卷烟》一整部电影是讲几个被社会遗弃的人，关超是英兵，他的南亚朋友文尼是新移民，好像不被主流接受。所以他们有句对白，文尼说，这个地方跟我想象的不一样。关超说，是你们傻，你们以为自己去了天堂吗？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;《手卷烟》的大部分剧情发生在关超家，一个逼仄的小屋。我第一次看景，光很亮，尖沙咀在香港是很繁荣的地方，很多招牌灯很亮，很斑斓。我说导演你相信我，关超依赖外面的光打进来照着他的生命，其实他生活一点也不亮，要有黑暗的效果。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;我还跟导演讲，90年代整个社会很投机，人贪心，没有身份要怎么弥补？赚钱。那个年头我在TVB拍电视剧，摄影师也是一路拍，一路看股票涨跌。所以电影里出现了一个人做股票买卖，输掉了。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;我用一点点人生经验告诉你，我觉得这个样子最能配合《手卷烟》这个内容。电影为什么那么饱满，因为我经历过。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;但是那时他求职很不顺利，前前后后投了一二十份简历，都没有收到回应。他坦言，“这个非常打击我的自信心，所以最后才会想到看看有没有国外的工作机会。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;那份令他深陷缅甸诈骗园区的国外工作，是通过中介找的。张先生介绍，他看对方多年时间一直帮国内的人寻找国外的工作机会，所以比较信任对方。这个中介给他推荐了一份新加坡的工作，“薪资待遇比较合理，每月1.5万元加提成，每周工作六天，每天工作10小时，比国内的工作要辛苦，但是包吃包住，待遇比较合理，所以打算试一试。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;此前接受专访时，张先生曾告诉南都记者，原本希望出国谋求工作机会，却被诱骗至缅甸诈骗园区。 They worked 18 hours a day under strict supervision, were punished corporally if they failed to complete their performance, and were severely beaten if they were found to have &quot;leaked secrets&quot;.后来经多方营救，他于9月5日回国。 &lt;/p>;

On August 30, 2023, a netizen surnamed Liu with the online name &quot;Liu Shao&quot; reported in real name on the social media platform that there were construction quality problems in the Qinghai Tongsai Expressway Taohe Bridge built by China Railway Fifth Engineering Bureau No. 5 Company. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu claimed to be the actual construction party and began to undertake the substructure project of the Taohe Bridge on April 6, 2022, which lasted more than eight months. He reported that the project leader of China Railway No. 5 Bureau No. 5 Company &quot;did not use steel bars from the shortlisted manufacturers according to the design, privately used non-standard steel bars from non-shortlisted manufacturers, cut corners during construction, and used unqualified sand and gravel materials during winter construction, resulting in poor concrete quality.&quot; qualified&quot;. Among them, statements such as &quot;the pile inspection process changed the second-category piles to the first-category piles&quot;, &quot;80% of the pile foundation steel bars are unqualified&quot; and &quot;there are hidden safety and quality risks&quot; attracted the attention of the outside world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the evening of September 6, the Fifth Company of China Railway No. 5 Bureau issued a public statement stating that it had previously entrusted Qinghai Provincial Traffic Inspection Co., Ltd. as a third-party testing agency to conduct quality inspections on the bridge. The inspection report shows that &quot;the physical quality of the Taohe Bridge meets the design requirements and the quality is qualified.&quot; The steel bars and concrete used in the construction are all qualified, and the pile foundation tests are all Class I piles. Liu&#39;s reports have been refuted one by one. At present, the competent authority has entrusted a testing agency to &quot;conduct physical quality inspection and raw material sampling inspection&quot;, and the re-inspection results will be announced to the public in a timely manner. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu didn’t buy it. He showed evidence to &quot;Running News&quot; and said, &quot;The test report I got contains Class II piles.&quot; The pouring time was May 26, 2022. The test date is June 29, 2022. Liu admitted that he made the report because the Fifth Company of China Railway No. 5 Bureau not only refused to pay him for his labor services, but instead cleared him from the site, causing heavy losses to him. “Now I have to report the project quality issues even if I don’t need any money.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to media reports, Liu was sued by China Railway No. 5 Bureau No. 5 Company to the People&#39;s Court of Ledu District, Haidong City, Qinghai Province for infringing the company&#39;s reputation rights because he reported that his labor fees had not been settled. The case will be heard in court on September 18. Liu also presented evidence, saying that he had received a message from the other party &quot;Look at the hardness of our China Railway No. 5 Bureau&quot; after reporting with his real name; the other party also proposed a &quot;compensation plan&quot;, but he did not agree if he was not satisfied. The Fifth Company of China Railway No. 5 Bureau responded that Liu’s main purpose was blackmail and “I will report it as soon as I don’t get the blackmail.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This incident has evolved to this point and has gradually become &quot;out of focus&quot;: the dispute between Liu and China Railway has become a new hot spot. A closer look at this incident reveals that there are actually two important aspects that deserve further analysis and questioning. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First, the relationship between the civil dispute between Liu and the Fifth Company of China Railway Fifth Engineering Bureau and his reporting behavior. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Whether it is Liu&#39;s self-report or the &quot;extortion of money&quot; accusation from China Railway No. 5 Bureau, it is shown that the report was due to Liu&#39;s financial demands and that the two parties had a civil dispute. But what is curious is why the case was initiated by China Railway No. 5 Engineering Co., Ltd. against Liu for &quot;infringement of reputation rights&quot; instead of Liu launching a civil lawsuit against China Railway No. 5 Engineering Co., Ltd. due to a labor contract dispute? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The cause of this incident was an economic dispute over &quot;unpaid labor fees&quot;. Following this line of thought, Liu first reported the problem when he could not get the labor fee, but was sued for &quot;infringement of reputation rights&quot;. Then, instead of filing a civil lawsuit on the grounds of a labor contract dispute and demanding payment of the labor fee, he filed an online lawsuit He reported that the project was cutting corners and materials, saying &quot;I have to report project quality problems even if I don&#39;t get labor fees,&quot; and rejected China Railway&#39;s compensation plan. This shows that Liu escalated the incident at all costs, giving the outside world the impression that &quot;the fish is dead and the net is broken.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Looking at the evolution of the incident, there are still some questions hidden in the game between the two parties during this period: Has Liu&#39;s labor fee been settled? If it was indeed not settled, Liu initially went to China Railway Fifth Engineering Bureau and the relevant departments in Qinghai to report this problem. I am afraid it was just a normal rights protection. Why was he sued by the Fifth Company of China Railway Fifth Engineering Bureau for &quot;infringement of the company&#39;s reputation rights&quot;? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the chat records provided by Liu, the words of a person from the China Railway No. 5 Bureau after the real-name report, &quot;The more you cause trouble, the less afraid I am. Look at the hardness of our China Railway No. 5 Bureau&quot; to the outside world. It leaves more room for interpretation. This sentence can make people reasonably speculate that Liu chose to &quot;turn the table&quot; by exposing the quality problems of the project precisely because his demands for labor fees were repeatedly ignored by the other party. So, will the labor fees be settled on time, or will the compensation plan of China Railway No. 5 Bureau No. 5 Company satisfy Liu after the report, and the matter will be settled smoothly? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If Liu came out to expose the project quality problems just because the labor fees were not paid, and the project quality problems were true, then the whole incident would have the flavor of &quot;unevenly sharing the spoils, and turning the table over in anger&quot;. The problem behind it is undoubtedly more worrying; or, if the truth is as claimed by China Railway No. 5 Bureau No. 5 Company, Liu intends to &quot;extort money&quot;, then whether the test results and the evidence he presented are forged, and how much his labor fees are? A clear answer should also be given as to why it was not settled and why it was not settled. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Secondly, whether the truth of the incident is that Liu extorted money or that the Fifth Company of the China Railway Fifth Bureau was in arrears of labor fees, it cannot conceal the most important focus of this incident: whether the construction of the Taohe Bridge on the Tongsai Expressway was completed. Through safety inspection, whether there are any project quality problems. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Public information shows that the Tongsai Expressway has a total length of 204 kilometers, and the total estimated investment of the project is 18.562 billion yuan. The main project will start on June 15, 2022, and is planned to be completed in October 2025. This expressway connects Qinghai Huangnan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture and the Qinghai-Gansu border area. It is a section of the &quot;G0611 Zhangwen Expressway&quot;. The Taohe Bridge is located in Saierlong Township, with a total length of 824.5 meters and a total of 20 spans. On July 17, 2023, the first box girder of the bridge was successfully erected. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu Mou chose to report after the substructure project of the Taohe Bridge was completed and the first box girder was successfully erected. Judging from the current situation, it was because of the intensification of economic disputes. Which one is more convincing is the previous test results announced by the fifth company of China Railway Fifth Engineering Bureau, the test results of the supervision company commissioned by Liu himself, and the evidence presented. This is something that the competent authorities should conduct an in-depth and serious investigation in the follow-up. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, inconsistencies between actual construction and prior surveys are relatively common in the engineering community. If Liu&#39;s accusation is true and China Railway No. 5 Bureau No. 5 Company chooses &quot;non-standard steel bars, unqualified sand and gravel materials and Class II piles&quot; in construction, its impact on the quality of the project will also need to be determined through professional evaluation. The key to the problem is whether changing construction materials will affect the quality of the project and thus endanger the safety of the Taohe Bridge. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In short, the focus of this matter should not be on the dispute between Liu and China Railway No. 5 Bureau. Relevant departments should adhere to the principle of safety first in the follow-up investigation, focus on the inspection of project quality, investigate whether the fifth company of China Railway No. 5 Bureau made normal changes in construction materials or cut corners, and fully demonstrate the impact of changes in construction materials on the traffic of the Taohe Bridge. impact on safety and fully disclose the findings to the public. If there is indeed a case of cutting corners and affecting the quality of the bridge, the relevant responsible persons should be severely dealt with and even held criminally responsible; if the whistleblower spreads rumors and causes trouble, he cannot go unpunished. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 16 Sep 2023 11:25:04 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
