The sales volume of the channel remains high. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;However, compared with its popularity online, the offline development of snail noodles has obvious shortcomings. What kind of distinction does the online and offline development of snail noodles show? How can snail noodles achieve offline breakthrough? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/15/pdJbFUnNE17d3MkdvHFhyInXFEMsFNYPnJFwQpXt.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/15/pdJbFUnNE17d3MkdvHFhyInXFEMsFNYPnJFwQpXt.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;258356&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; >;&lt;strong>;Hot online sales&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Snail noodles originated from the Liuzhou Night Market in the 1970s. It gradually became popular in the 1980s, but it was mainly limited to the local area, and then slowly spread to all of Guangxi and the neighboring Guangdong Province. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In 2012, &quot;A Bite of China&quot; brought snail fans more into the public eye, but for people outside the Guangdong and Guangxi regions, it is still only As the name suggests, Luosifeng’s offline stores have not expanded too much to other provinces, and there are no online sales channels. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In 2014, Liuzhou’s first prepackaged snail noodle company was registered, and industrially produced bagged snail noodle appeared. At the beginning of 2015, the Liuzhou Municipal Government proposed the development concept of &quot;industrialization, standardization, branding, and scale&quot; of Liuzhou&#39;s snail noodles, and determined the road for Liuzhou&#39;s snail noodles industry to be packaged and industrialized. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;2016 is the first year of live broadcasting. Luosi fans have keenly grasped the trend of the times and jumped on the &quot;Internet +&quot; short video and live broadcast express. The characteristics of &quot;smellful and smelly&quot; are quite contagious and quickly spread out of the circle through online channels. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In 2019, the industry output value of Liuzhou&#39;s bagged snail noodles exceeded 6 billion yuan. The impact of the epidemic, the rise of the &quot;stay-at-home economy&quot;, and the booming live-streaming of goods have boosted the online popularity of snail noodles. In 2020, the annual output value of bagged snail noodles exceeded 10 billion. In 2022, the sales revenue of the entire industry chain of Liuzhou snail noodles will be 60.07 billion yuan, and the sales revenue of bagged snail noodles will be 18.18 billion yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Naturally, the online sales of snail noodles account for half of the total. iiMedia Research’s research data shows that among the channels through which Chinese snail noodle consumers purchase products, online shopping malls rank first with a proportion of 78.70%. Other data show that in 2022, 113 million snail noodle packages were sent through express delivery channels, becoming the first single product in Guangxi with an annual delivery volume exceeding 100 million. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The popularity of snail noodles online is not only due to its close integration with &quot;Internet +&quot;, but also because it fits the &quot;fast food life&quot; of this generation of young people. The characteristics of the food require that the food should not only be convenient and efficient, but also sufficient and delicious. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Other instant noodles have few ingredients. Snail noodles are rich in ingredients, including yuba, pickled bamboo shoots, pickled beans, fungus, peanuts, dried radish and other common accessories. Bao snail rice noodles have everything, and they are more attractive to young people’s stomachs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/15/qQaycB5JHwjp4VIJdLJ2rQsIUXTRJxhCjzFbLsgY.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/15/qQaycB5JHwjp4VIJdLJ2rQsIUXTRJxhCjzFbLsgY.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;258357&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; >;&lt;strong>;Offline stores have shortcomings&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;However, compared with the popularity of online stores, offline stores of snail noodles have obvious shortcomings. plate. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On the one hand, there are now more than 40,000 offline stores of snail noodles. Compared with the approximately 500,000 offline stores of Lanzhou Ramen, It&#39;s like a small witch can see a big witch. Not to mention, the annual sales of Lanzhou Ramen are roughly estimated to exceed 400 billion yuan, which is several times that of snail noodles. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On the other hand, relevant data shows that the average offline catering chain rate of snail noodles is only 15%, compared with 45% for tea drinks. Coffee is 55%, which shows that there is no strong enough brand of snail noodles to go offline, and the risk of &quot;having a category but not a brand&quot; has intensified. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Not only that, there are also some worrying aspects regarding the existing offline stores of snail noodles. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;First, the offline stores of snail noodles are mainly concentrated in Guangxi and Guangdong, and the national penetration rate is still relatively low. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;For example, iiMedia Consulting data shows that from 2020 to February 2023, most of the new snail noodle companies are located in Guangdong and Guangxi, and the proportion of snail noodle companies in Guangxi is as high as 21.63% and 21.21% of snail noodle companies are located in Guangdong Province. This is much weaker than the national radiation intensity of Lanzhou Ramen and Shaxian snacks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Secondly, due to the low chain rate, many offline snail noodle stores are small &quot;mom-and-pop&quot;-style workshops with varying tastes and quality, and individual stores are hygienic. The worrying situation has lowered consumers’ trust in offline stores of snail noodles. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Some time ago, rumors spread widely that &quot;there were many mice jumping up and down in the back kitchen of a snail noodle shop in Chongqing.&quot; Although the Municipal Supervision Bureau of Jiulongpo District, Chongqing made a report stating that law enforcement officers did an on-site inspection and found no traces of rats in the snail noodle shop; the video was taken in March this year, because the decoration of the shop next door damaged the flue outlet of the shop, causing rats to enter After discovering the situation in the back kitchen, the person in charge of the store immediately carried out disinfection and repairs and rectifications in the store. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Such rumors have done great harm to the offline stores of Luosi Fen, and also reflect the public&#39;s concerns about food safety issues. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Thirdly, offline snail noodles stores only offer a single variety of food, and relying solely on snail noodles will limit the development of offline stores. For example, Lanzhou Ramen Shop not only offers ramen noodles, but also Northwest-style pasta products such as rice bowls, steamed buns, and cold noodles; Shaxian snacks include mixed noodles, steamed dumplings, flat dishes, duck leg rice, and other choices. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/15/eoTDhBOBwFpinLd8rjTPIIrBC0BQjM65vIjZKfWF.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/15/eoTDhBOBwFpinLd8rjTPIIrBC0BQjM65vIjZKfWF.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;258355&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; >;&lt;strong>;The snail noodles&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;stand out&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Of course, compared with the offline stores of Lanzhou Ramen and Shaxian Snacks, Sloan noodles are blooming everywhere, and offline stores of snail noodles still have broad room for expansion, but this does not mean that snail noodles should &quot;underestimate themselves&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In fact, compared with Lanzhou Ramen, the development route of &quot;industrialization, standardization, branding, and scale&quot; of snail noodles is earlier and more mature. There are many ramen noodle restaurants in Lanzhou, but they are also faced with the embarrassment of &quot;having categories but not brands&quot;. This is a shortcoming that Lanzhou ramen is now making great efforts to make up for. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;To successfully break through, snail powder offline stores must, on the one hand, give full play to the advantages of &quot;industrialization, standardization, branding, and scale&quot; and transform the current few stores into The snail noodle brand continues to grow bigger and stronger, and the chain layout is accelerated. It is necessary to establish both the category and the brand. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Secondly, efforts should be made to industrialize the supply chain and build a professional, platform-based supply chain service provider to fill the gap in the snail noodle supply chain business. Blank, so that even small workshop-style snail noodle stores can obtain stable quality snail noodle raw materials, so that consumers can taste snail noodle with stable taste and stabilize the reputation of offline snail noodle stores. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Third, as a regional delicacy, if snail noodles want to conquer the stomachs of people across the country, in addition to making authentic snail noodles, we also need to enrich the line. The gourmet food category in the lower store. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;One ​​way is to focus on snail noodles but also sell other local delicacies from Liuzhou and even Guangxi to enrich consumers&#39; choice space, such as some from Liuzhou Local delicacies, such as Yong Tau Foo Pao, Niu Xianzi, Yun Pian Cake, Miao Sour Pork, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Another way is to combine it with local cuisine and move toward integration, launching cross-category meals, stir-fries, soups, etc. This kind of integration poses a very big challenge to the management of chain brands, which must not only ensure standardization, but also successfully &quot;do as the Romans do.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Although snail noodles have fully opened up the online space, if snail noodles want to continue to break through the upper limit of the industry, they must walk both online and offline. Luosifen offline stores are accelerating the layout. Whether it can create miracles like online stores is worth waiting to see. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 16 Nov 2023 11:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[为什么年轻人不愿意生孩子？社会学家山田昌弘谈日本低生育困境]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260643]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-16 10:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 11/15/taEK4maI9T2bb8Z7gCUaLE0BNS59Ew6Ignwi5oPp.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1039&quot; height=&quot;1559&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/15/taEK4maI9T2bb8Z7gCUaLE0BNS59Ew6I gnwi5oPp. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;258346&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Japanese sociologist Yamada Masahiro, professor at Chuo University, specializes in family sociology and emotional society Xuexue, etc., are the authors of &quot;Society with a Few Births&quot;, &quot;The Era of Marriage&quot;, &quot;The Low-Birth Trap&quot;, etc. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of interviewee)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Masahiro Yamada, a professor at Chuo University in Japan, has been deeply involved in the field of family sociology for many years. Before high school, he once wanted to be a mathematician, but &quot;because I don&#39;t have a family of my own, I decided to explore what family love is&quot; and since then entered the &quot;world of studying messy families.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When teaching in school, he used a lot of family materials to tell the origin, current situation and whereabouts of modern Japanese families. The seminars he held with students were on cutting-edge topics and discussed issues such as: To what extent do people need to &quot;rent friends&quot; when they are lonely? Does &quot;cohabiting partnership marriage&quot; (note: only cohabitation without marriage) explore another possibility beyond the current marriage system? There are more and more single young people in Japan. Where can their emotional needs for intimacy be met? He finally found some answers in cabaret clubs (note: places that provide singing and dancing performances), real or virtual idols, and pets. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the book &quot;The Low Fertility Trap&quot;, Masahiro Yamada tries to answer a question: Why are young people in Japan reluctant to have children in recent years? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Low fertility rate has always been a dark cloud lingering over Japanese society. Since 1989, Japan&#39;s fertility rate has continued to be sluggish, with the total fertility rate remaining below 1.6 for more than 30 years. In 2022, it reached a historical low of 1.26. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/15/15ki05kPI4oa4sovRe8QOk5LByuBCKIbPNPX7uAi.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height= &quot;532&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/15/15ki05kPI4oa4sovRe8QOk5LByuBCKIbPNPX7uAi.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;258344&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Since 1989, Japan&#39;s fertility rate has continued to be sluggish, with the total fertility rate below 1.6 for more than 30 years, and it reached a historical low of 1.26 in 2022 . The picture shows a still from the Japanese drama &quot;Obstetrician Kotori&quot;. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Information map/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past thirty years, Japanese society has tried to solve this &quot;stubborn disease&quot;, but with little success. Yamada Masahiro was a member of the Committee on Countermeasures against Birthrate Reduction. Once, a committee member proposed holding a publicity campaign titled &quot;Parenting is Wonderful&quot; to increase the public&#39;s enthusiasm for childbirth. &quot;Many insightful people and policy leaders in Japanese society have ignored for a long time two important factors directly related to the cause of Japan&#39;s declining birthrate, namely &#39;non-marriage&#39; and &#39;the widening gap in the economic level of young people&#39; .&quot; Yamada believes, &quot;For the majority of people who &#39;want to have children but do not have the conditions, so they do not have children&#39;, it is meaningless to carry out such publicity activities.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Yamada Masahiro&#39;s view , young people’s desire to have children is linked to the overall economic status of society. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1955, the Japanese economy entered a period of rapid growth. The prosperous economic environment gave rise to young people&#39;s positive expectations for the future. They tended to believe that through personal efforts, they could join the &quot;middle class&quot; and live a better life than their parents. A better, richer life. &quot;From World War II to about 1980, people did not think about the great risks in their economic life after marriage. At that time, men could count on becoming full-time employees, and their income would be based on the &#39;seniority system&#39; (note: wages will vary according to merit). (increasing with age and length of service).&quot; In Yamada Masahiro&#39;s view, people of that generation firmly believed that their children would grow up in a better environment than themselves. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the 1980s, the situation reversed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Entering the Heisei Era (Note: January 8, 1989), Japan&#39;s economic structure was adjusted, and a large number of informal employees (referring to fixed-term employees, part-time employees, dispatched employees, etc.) appeared. Social gaps have arisen in terms of employment, which in turn has led to gaps between the rich and poor families and the educational environment of their children, and the polarization of society has further developed.&quot; Masahiro Yamada said in an interview with Japanese media, &quot;For most informal employees, regardless of whether No matter how hard I try, I can&#39;t earn the income that will allow me to live a prosperous life in the future, nor can I get married and start a family. In other words, my future has become hopeless.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yamada observed, The Japanese pay more attention to the significance of marriage from an economic perspective and will make a careful risk assessment before making a decision to get married. The evaluation often starts from two perspectives: first, whether the standard of living after marriage will be better than before marriage, or at least not worse; second, whether after marriage, the child can create a better growth environment than oneself. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Behind this view on marriage and childbearing are the unique values ​​of modern Japanese society: the hope to avoid risks in future life. The Japanese regard maintaining a middle-class living standard as their highest goal and believe that in life design, The series of issues of &#39;men and women dating&#39;, &#39;marriage&#39;, &#39;childbirth&#39;, &#39;child rearing&#39; and &#39;children&#39;s education&#39; are not single and separated, but are intertwined.&quot; Yamada Masahiro in the paper &quot;East Asian Characteristics of the Low Birth Rate Problem&quot; wrote. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This awareness of risk also extends to the relationship stage. Yamada found that in Japan, many young people are even losing their desire to fall in love. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;NHK Broadcasting Culture Research Institute once conducted a survey of Japanese middle and high school students and found that the proportions of middle and high school students who &quot;have a crush&quot; were 41% and 54% respectively in 1982. In 2012, this figure dropped sharply to 25% and 31%. In 2014, the Japanese Cabinet Office conducted a survey on young people and found that more than one-third of the respondents preferred to spend time on work and study, and 46.2% felt that &quot;love is troublesome.&quot; In Yamada Masahiro’s view, “trouble” may mean “not cost-effective”. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the 1990s, when the phenomenon of declining birthrate first appeared in Japanese society, demographers held a mainstream view: young people just postponed marriage to enjoy single life, and one day they would get married. . Masahiro Yamada believes that such a logical basis may not be established. Over the past few decades, as Japanese society has gradually developed into a &quot;high-consumption society&quot;, the anxiety and pressure of childcare has also hit young people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/15/sZwSWsI8dblFzL7uTjuuPTz6YmJTOauI6ffsygCC.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/15/sZwSWsI8dblFzL7uTjuuPTz6YmJTOauI6ffsygCC.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;258345&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In December 2022, on the streets of Tokyo, Japan, a couple took wedding photos on the streets decorated with Christmas lights. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China Map/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2015, Japan’s National Institute of Social Security and Population Issues conducted a survey on 30 -Why married women in the 34-year-old age group fail to have the expected number of children? 81.1% of the survey respondents believe that the reason is that &quot;the raising and education of children is too expensive.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Yamada’s view, modern society’s expectations for the function of marriage and childbearing are different from pre-modern society. In a society centered on agricultural production, childbirth means supplementing the labor force. Parents place expectations on their children to inherit the family business and take care of their parents later in life. Children are a kind of &quot;productive property.&quot; But after the 1950s, Japan began to &quot;nuclear family&quot; with reference to the family system in Europe and the United States. A couple and their unmarried children became the basic family unit. In modern society, raising children requires a large amount of childcare money, and children have therefore become &quot;consumable property.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;The significance of children as a labor force no longer exists, and when the nuclear family becomes a principle, it is difficult to expect children to provide support and care in their old age. In addition, parents who can let their children inherit the family business It has also become less.&quot; Yamada Masahiro wrote in &quot;The Low Birth Trap&quot; that unlike European and American parents who enjoy the joy and fun of parenting itself, many times, East Asian parents care about whether to have a &quot;high-value&quot; child—— In the social evaluation system established by external factors such as academic qualifications and work, whether children can take the top spot. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yamada believes that East Asian parents often have a &quot;protective feeling&quot; for their children and do not want their children to &quot;live a hard life&quot;. It is also part of the value of parents for children to receive help from their parents when they receive higher education and even become adults. . As a result, the age of responsibility of East Asian parents for their children has been extended indefinitely. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In October 2023, Japanese sociologist Masahiro Yamada accepted a written interview with a reporter from Southern Weekend. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;East Asian parents take it for granted that they spend money on their children&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: italics, Italics_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;China&#39;s total fertility rate fell to 1.09 in 2022, which is lower than Japan&#39;s 1.26 and higher than South Korea&#39;s 0.78. In 2022, the total fertility rate of the three East Asian countries dropped to historical lows. You have done a lot of research on fertility wishes in Japan. Why are young people reluctant to have children? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Masahiro Yamada:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;In East Asia (China, Japan and South Korea), marriage and childcare are first considered from an economic perspective. When people raise children, they will want to spend more money on their children than their parents raised themselves. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past (50 years ago in Japan and 30 years ago in China and South Korea), the lives of most young people’s parents and the lives of young people themselves were relatively poor. And since society as a whole is in a period of economic growth, young people&#39;s future income can be expected to increase. So, at that time, it would be easier, and in fact it was, to spend more money on your own children than your own parents had raised. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, starting 30 years ago in Japan and 10 years ago in China and South Korea, the children of the previous generation whose parents spent more money to raise them now have to spend money to raise their own children. These young people often have parents who are wealthier than themselves. In China, due to the large number of only children, the cost of this generation of only children is estimated to be more than twice that of Japan and South Korea. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is very difficult to spend more money on children born in the future when economic growth is slowing down. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;The process of family modernization in East Asian society is to imitate and learn from the European and American nuclear family. Process and the same social model, why do East Asian countries currently face more severe fertility difficulties than European and American societies? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Masahiro Yamada:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;East Asian countries only imitate the nuclear family model, but due to different social environments and traditions, the feedback these models receive will naturally vary. different. For example, parents in East Asia believe that spending money on children is natural and can bring a lot of emotional value; they believe in the love between parents and children more than the love between husband and wife. This also leads to a significant reduction in the need for marriage if one does not plan to have children. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Europe and the United States believe that it is necessary to raise children until adulthood, while East Asian countries believe that it is natural to bear the cost of higher education for children. In contrast, parents in East Asian countries have to shoulder more childcare responsibilities and often need help solving various problems their children encounter even after they become adults. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;In the past few years, the Chinese government has introduced some policies to encourage childbirth. For example, the three-child policy and the establishment of a childcare subsidy system have been proposed in many places. You said in &quot;The Low Fertility Trap&quot; that the Japanese government failed to seize the best opportunity to intervene in low fertility, and Japan&#39;s low birthrate policy failed. What lessons and inspiration can Japan’s experience bring to other countries? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Masahiro Yamada:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;We must consider reducing the burden of children’s education fees. A quarter of young people feel uneasy about the future, which is the main reason for Japan&#39;s declining birthrate. Measures should be taken so that young people will not feel insecure about not being able to live a prosperous life in the future. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We must transform our society into a society where every young person has hope that his children will not suffer in the future. That is, building a society where jobs are re-startable, equally friendly to two-income families, and where social security can help us get back on our feet if things go wrong. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Can you combine your own with that of your previous and next generations? Experience, talk about the changes in the situation and concepts of marriage and childbirth among young people in Japan? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Yamada Masahiro: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;The concept itself has not changed much. If there is an expectation of living a relatively good life, then it is natural to get married and have children. The difference may be that people of the previous generation would have thought that they could live a prosperous life on their husband&#39;s income alone (about 30 years ago). Even today, nearly three-quarters of young people who are able to meet expectations are already married and have children. The reason why the remaining one-quarter of young people do not choose to get married and have children is mostly because their income is unstable and they are unable to They expect to live a relatively good life after getting married and having children. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Is marriage and childbirth a matter of decency? &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You put forward a point: wait for the one that suits you The idea that a partner appears and then gets married was once generally accepted, but now it is difficult to bring people into marriage. If today&#39;s young people want to get married, they need to participate in &quot;marriage activities&quot; (note: various activities to find marriage partners, first proposed by Yamada Masahiro). Why is there such a change? Isn’t it possible to get married if you don’t participate in the wedding ceremony? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Masahiro Yamada:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Because there are fewer places where young people can meet each other naturally. Not to mention men, even women&#39;s so-called &quot;men will take the initiative to strike up a conversation even if they don&#39;t take the initiative&quot; has become less common. The community or enterprises have to provide some opportunities so that young men and women can have more contact. If you want to find a marriage partner, you should still take active action. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;&quot;Marriage&quot; is called blind date in China. For people born in the 1970s and 1980s in China, free love and marriage were a common view on marriage and love when they were young, but among today&#39;s young people, the concept of being well-matched is being revived. Are there similar changes in the concept of marriage in Japanese society? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Masahiro Yamada:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;In Japan, the consciousness of “fall in love first and then get married” has not changed. Young people&#39;s longing for love and marriage and their distaste for parents interfering with free love are still relatively strong. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although we don’t care so much about the target’s family background, the economic life after marriage, that is, the overall family income of the couple after marriage, is a very important reference factor. Today&#39;s young people have a very strong sense of being &quot;middle-class.&quot; Most of them feel that they were in a middle-class life when they were with their parents, so they really don&#39;t want to fall from the middle-class life after marriage. This is also a habit of &quot;avoiding risks&quot; and &quot;valuing respectability.&quot; reflection of Japanese social characteristics. However, Japan does not have the custom like China that the male family needs to contribute a lot of money when getting married. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You seem to place great emphasis on analyzing the motivations for marriage and childbirth at the economic level. . You mentioned that in European and American societies, people do not strongly associate building a family (getting married, having children) with economic status, but not in East Asian societies. Why do East Asian societies place so much emphasis on the correlation between the two? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Masahiro Yamada:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;East Asians value decency more, which is “face” in Chinese. People don’t want to be seen as having an unhappy marriage or poor parenting. There is a strong sense of shame associated with living a poor life. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Europe and the United States, love between husband and wife is the expression of happiness, and the awareness that living in poverty can also be happy is very popular; in East Asian societies, even without love between husband and wife, living A rich life can also be a happy one, and this awareness is very strong. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;There is a view that in modern families, &quot;the male is the dominant one and the female is the dominant one.&quot; The division of labor within the family means that women have to devote more time and energy to childcare. What do you think of this practical problem? How does Japanese society respond to this? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Masahiro Yamada:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;It is gradually becoming a prerequisite for a wealthy family to have a certain income and continue working for women. Since there are only a limited number of high-income men who can do &quot;men take care of the outside world and women take care of the house&quot;, in order to raise children in affluent living conditions, it has become very necessary for women to work outside the home and for men to participate in housework. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Japan, this ideal is gradually becoming a reality by popularizing maternity leave and improving the construction of kindergartens. However, the Japanese government&#39;s &quot;two-dimensional support&quot; for women&#39;s work and childcare is obviously far from enough. It is still necessary to continue to improve the working environment, eliminate gender discrimination, and allow more women to engage in meaningful work. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Cultivating &quot;high-value&quot; children, a twisted expectation&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font -family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You mentioned that young people in Japan have the idea that &quot;children cannot be allowed to suffer&quot;. This idea also exists among young people in China. Why do young people care about nurturing children? Has a generation developed such a strong sense of responsibility? Has the meaning of “suffering” changed with the development of the times? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Masahiro Yamada:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;In East Asian societies, it is the responsibility of parents to let their children receive a better education and find a better job than themselves. The meaning of life. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, the awareness of discrimination among children is also very strong. Today&#39;s young people are worried that their poverty will cause their children to be bullied. When children play together, they sometimes need external hardware like Switch game consoles. If I don’t buy these things, will my children feel pain? This idea among young parents is becoming more and more intense. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past, it was enough for parents to be able to stay with their children, but now more and more parents feel that it will be uncomfortable if they cannot spend enough money on their children. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;In China, unmarried men and women of working age may be harassed by their parents and elders Those who urge marriage are called bachelors or leftover women, which has a certain derogatory meaning. Is there a similar situation in Japan? How do you understand this phenomenon? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Masahiro Yamada: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Single = unpopular. This equation will indirectly remind people of whether the reason for not getting married is because men have low incomes. , or is it because there is something wrong with women’s appearance. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Japan, because the unmarried rate is very high, people who want to get married but can’t, and people who can but don’t want to get married are mixed together, so simply treating unmarried people Put downs are uncommon. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Also because the unmarried rate is very high, the pressure from parents is much less than before. Many parents will think that it is better for their children to stay at home alone than to let their children marry someone with a low income and then live a less than ideal life of poverty. In Japan, a growing number of parents believe it is better to keep their children single than to be hung up on strange marriage partners. The awareness of inheriting the family business is gradually declining in Japan (people over 70 years old still have a strong awareness of this awareness). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You mentioned that in pre-modern society, children were a kind of &quot; &quot;Producive property&quot; becomes &quot;consumer property&quot; in modern society, requiring a higher investment in childcare. Having a child with a &quot;high sense of value&quot; becomes the value pursued by parenting behavior, and the sense of high value is determined by the child&#39;s academic qualifications, Depends on factors such as the glamor of the job. Why do parents have such expectations for child care? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Masahiro Yamada:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;The status of children = the status of parents. In East Asian cultural circles, this awareness of face or vanity is very strong. From an emotional point of view, this stems from parents&#39; desire for their children to live a carefree life financially. Although the original intention is good, with the comparison psychology brought about by the consciousness of decency, raising high-value children has become a distorted expectation. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;European and American traditions are very different. When children become adults, they no longer depend on their parents financially and have a strong sense of self-responsibility. For parents, children are cute during the upbringing process, but when they grow up, they only expect emotional communication. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;It seems that parenting is gradually evolving into a kind of competition. Is there a &quot;school district housing&quot; and &quot;chicken baby&quot; phenomenon in Japan? Will a highly competitive society have an impact on fertility? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Masahiro Yamada:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Japan’s job market has relatively loose requirements for academic qualifications, and the salary gap between high school graduates and college graduates is one of the largest in the world. small. In other words, it is possible to live a relatively good life even after graduating from high school or a junior college. Parents don’t need to be so enthusiastic, especially those who have only graduated from high school themselves. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Young people are becoming more risk-averse&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font -family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;One ​​possible reason for the decline in young people&#39;s desire to get married is that more and more people realize that marriage is a contractual relationship and that the contract is at risk of breaking. Why do more and more young people tend to make risk assessments about getting married? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Masahiro Yamada:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;For young people, whether they can live a middle-class life in the future is something they are very concerned about. In Japan, before 1990, most young people could expect to rely on the &quot;merit-based system&quot; to live a life with wages increasing every year. However, with the development of globalization, economic risks are increasing, and today&#39;s young people can no longer afford it. Be optimistic that &quot;there will always be a way in the future.&quot; For this reason, young people are becoming more risk-averse. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If you live a relatively poor life from the beginning, you generally don’t feel that there is any risk, but many young people today live a quite fulfilling and wealthy life in their teenage years life. The awareness of not wanting to give up this life will be strong. Especially for the generation of Chinese young people who are only children, this awareness should be even stronger. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You mentioned a phenomenon: today’s young people are not even willing to fall in love Desire is fading. South Korea has the &quot;Three Abandonments&quot; (giving up on love, marriage, and childbirth), Japan has &quot;herbivore men&quot; (passive and inactive in love), and some young people in China think falling in love is troublesome. Why do young people lose the desire to fall in love? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Masahiro Yamada: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Because modern young people feel that love relationships will always &quot;cool down.&quot; In Europe and the United States, &quot;being with the person you love&quot; is the meaning of life. However, this idea is not widespread in East Asian countries. In the eyes of many people, falling in love is actually a process of finding a marriage partner. Therefore, they also believe that dating someone who knows they cannot get married is a waste of time and money. More and more people believe that love itself is a matter of worrying about other people&#39;s unhappiness. Because of the expansion of the porn industry, especially in Japan, the sexual value of dating has also decreased. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 凯体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Many people meet their love needs through virtual relationships, such as The popular AI boyfriends and girlfriends, or &quot;CP addicts&quot;, gain emotional satisfaction from watching others fall in love. How do you understand these phenomena? Some people also question that obtaining emotional satisfaction through data calculation and monetary payment weakens the complexity of love. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Yamada Masahiro:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Although I think this is a form of escape, for today&#39;s young people, there are more and more People think this is a more enjoyable time of communication than real love. If the satisfaction of real love decreases, the value of virtual love will increase. Maybe it can no longer be said that satisfaction in reality is superior. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;In 1997 you named the &quot; In recent years, &quot;full-time children&quot; have also appeared in Chinese society, that is, children give up their jobs and go home to take care of housework and provide for their parents. Living expenses are borne by their parents, and some full-time children will also receive wages from their parents. You seem to be interested in emphasizing the connection between &quot;single parasites&quot; and the desire to marry and have children. Can you expand on this? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Yamada Masahiro:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>; Before meeting your ideal marriage partner, living a prosperous life with your parents, this kind of &quot;waiting&quot; is very likely There is no end. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Europe and the United States, because adults must be independent from their parents, it is more advantageous for two young people to live together. But in East Asian countries, independence from parents generally means that children can live a better life outside than at home with their parents. It’s okay to “wait” at your parents’ house before meeting the person you want to marry with whom you can live a better life together. Even your parents are looking forward to it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, we have never been able to wait for the ideal person to appear, and there is an endless stream of &quot;former&quot; young people who are slowly aging like this. In Japan, there are an increasing number of unmarried people who are still living with their parents even in middle age.

It&#39;s really not that difficult to come here. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, in East Asian countries, young people compare themselves with their parents. More and more young people believe that failure to reach the level of their parents is a failure. This is especially true for people who live a prosperous life under the care of their parents. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, in Japan, many young people believe that employment and marriage cannot be repeated, which is also one of the important influencing factors. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 16 Nov 2023 10:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[贫困生攒钱看演唱会惹争议，该不该限制助学对象高消费？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260617]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-16 08:30:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 16 Nov 2023 08:55:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[习近平同美国总统拜登举行中美元首会晤]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260688]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-16 08:43:26&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;video id=&quot;contents-video-0&quot; data-fileid=&quot;3270835011765296853&quot; data-media=&quot; video&quot; data-resource=&quot;tencent&quot; data-filename=&quot;Exclusive video丨Xi Jinping and US President Biden held the China-US Presidential Meeting.mp4&quot; data-cover=&quot;http://1251434507.vod2.myqcloud.com/d9dca36avodtranscq1251434507/ 79e1b7263270835011765296853/sampleSnapshot/sampleSnapshot_10_0.jpg&quot; data-url=&quot;http://1251434507.vod2.myqcloud.com/02f2b5c2vodcq1251434507/79e1b726327083501176 5296853/8IaqSQsxTcYA.mp4&quot; poster=&quot;&quot; controls=&quot;controls&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot; 360&quot;>; &lt;source src=&quot;http://1251434507.vod2.myqcloud.com/02f2b5c2vodcq1251434507/79e1b7263270835011765296853/8IaqSQsxTcYA.mp4&quot; type=&quot;video/mp4&quot;>;&lt;/video>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Local time 11 On March 15, President Xi Jinping held a China-US Presidential Meeting with US President Joe Biden at Philori Estate in San Francisco, USA. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xi Jinping pointed out that the last time Mr. President and I met was in Bali, and it has been a year. A lot has happened in the past year. The world has emerged from the COVID-19 pandemic, but the huge impact of the epidemic remains. The world economy has begun to recover, but it lacks momentum, industrial and supply chains are disrupted, and protectionism is on the rise. These problems are very prominent. As the most important bilateral relationship in the world, China-U.S. relations must be thought and planned against the backdrop of the accelerating changes in the world over the past century, so as to bring benefits to the people of both countries and demonstrate responsibility for human progress. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xi Jinping pointed out that over the past 50 years, Sino-US relations have never been smooth sailing. There will always be problems of one kind or another, and they will always move forward amid twists and turns. It is impossible for such two big countries not to deal with each other. It is unrealistic to try to change each other. No one can bear the consequences of conflict and confrontation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I still have the same view. Great power competition is not the background of this era and cannot solve the problems facing China, the United States and the world. This earth can accommodate China and the United States, and our respective successes are opportunities for each other. China and the United States have different histories, cultures, social systems, and development paths. This is an objective reality. However, as long as both sides adhere to mutual respect, peaceful coexistence, and win-win cooperation, they can transcend differences and find a way for the two major countries to get along correctly. I firmly believe that the future of Sino-US relations is bright. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The President and I are at the helm of Sino-US relations and bear heavy responsibilities for the people, the world, and history. I look forward to having an in-depth exchange of views and reaching new consensus with Mr. President today on strategic, overall and directional issues related to China-US relations, as well as major issues related to world peace and development. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 16 Nov 2023 08:55:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[被摘牌的55个中华老字号：停产、换新店、准备重申]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260668]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-16 08:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;The Ministry of Commerce will review 1,128 time-honored brands in 2023.

Those that have been operating poorly for a long time have even gone bankrupt, canceled, closed down, or have lost the ownership and use rights of registered trademarks of time-honored brands. 55 brands were removed from the list of Chinese time-honored brands; 73 brands with poor operations and declining performance were required to be rectified within 6 months; 1,000 brands with standardized operations and good development were continued to be retained. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wujia Bacon is one of the 55 brands. Chinese time-honored brands were first selected by the former Ministry of Domestic Trade, and more than 1,600 were rated in 1991. In 2006, the Ministry of Commerce re-certified 429 Chinese time-honored brands in the first batch; in 2010, the Ministry of Commerce recognized 699 in the second batch. As of the beginning of 2023, there are 1,128 Chinese time-honored brands across the country. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In January 2023, in order to promote the innovative development of time-honored brands, the Ministry of Commerce and other five departments issued the &quot;Measures for the Administration of the Demonstration Creation of Chinese Time-honored Brands&quot; (hereinafter referred to as the &quot;Measures&quot;). In this &quot;Measures&quot;, the &quot;Measures&quot; were established The &quot;traffic light&quot; mechanism, that is, the dynamic management mechanism of &quot;in and out&quot;, takes rectification or removal measures for time-honored brands that do not meet the requirements. In February 2023, the Ministry of Commerce publicly stated that the &quot;honor&quot; of China&#39;s time-honored brands is not once and for all, let alone resting on the credit book to &quot;show off seniority&quot; or &quot;rest on one&#39;s laurels.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Three months after the &quot;Measures&quot; were issued, the Ministry of Commerce, together with the Ministry of Culture and Tourism and other ministries and commissions, decided to review the existing Chinese time-honored brands and carry out the certification of a new batch of Chinese time-honored brands, so that time-honored brands can &quot;come in and out&quot; . This is the first time that Chinese time-honored brands have been reviewed since they were recognized, but it is not the last time. The &quot;Measures&quot; stipulate that in principle, a new batch of Chinese time-honored brands will be recognized and published every three years. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;55 time-honored brands delisted&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;As of this delisting, Wujia Bacon has been a time-honored brand in China for nearly 30 years. In the early 1990s, Wujia Bacon in Linfen City, Shanxi Province was rated as a Chinese time-honored brand by the former Ministry of Domestic Trade. At that time, Wu Zhiyong, who had just grown up, as the fifth generation successor, was learning the ancestral condiment formula and processing technology from the basics. Now he has reached the age where he knows his destiny. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wu Zhiyong told Southern Weekend reporters that because he was busy launching a new production line at the time, he did not pay enough attention to the review. At the same time, it took too much time to search and complete historical data, resulting in missing the time to submit materials. Wu Zhiyong speculated that the removal may be due to Article 20 of the &quot;Measures&quot;: Enterprises are bankrupt, liquidated, disbanded, canceled, have their business licenses revoked, or have not carried out business activities for more than three years. They will be removed from the list of Chinese time-honored brands and the right to use the Chinese time-honored brand logo and plaque will be recovered. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The company owned by Wujia Bacon is Wujiabaoxing Bacon Products Co., Ltd. in Yaodu District, Linfen City. The company was liquidated in 2017. Wu Zhiyong explained that the company was jointly run by his father Wu Baoshan and his second uncle. Due to their old age and poor health, and the original bacon processing factory was demolished due to urban expansion in 2014, the two &quot;retired&quot;, and the Wu family bacon business also hiatus for 6 years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among the 55 brands that have been removed from the list of Chinese time-honored brands, many are in a similar situation to Wu’s Bacon. Southern Weekend reporters found out that most of the brand companies that were removed from the directory were canceled, bankrupt, removed from the list, etc., and even seriously violated the law. Some legal representatives of the companies were also listed as dishonest persons subject to execution, and high consumption was restricted. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporters tried to contact the 55 brands on the removal list, but most of them refused to be interviewed, except for some that could not be contacted. Among the few brands interviewed, the reasons for delisting varied. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The person in charge of Shanxi Yanhu brand told Southern Weekend reporters: &quot;When the last order on the handle is completed, I will never do it again.&quot; The person in charge of Inner Mongolia Dashengkui brand said that the company is still open, but it is not Produced, just to maintain the brand. Anhui Shouchuntang said that it is in the process of changing its store and will wait until a new place is found. The person in charge of Shanxi Mingquanbao said that the company is still open, but it is no longer producing, &quot;because the national standards do not allow the use of current boilers, and production can be resumed after replacing new boilers.&quot; The person in charge of the Shandong Shi Toad brand said that he had no idea about being &quot;kicked out&quot; of a Chinese time-honored brand. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As a businessman, a Southern Weekend reporter consulted a relevant person from the Circulation Development Department of the Ministry of Commerce. The other party replied: &quot;There are various reasons for being removed. It is not just bankruptcy or no longer operating that will be removed. .&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In real scenarios, the decline of some Chinese time-honored brands is more intuitive. Beijing Hua Nv Underwear, which was approved by the Ministry of Commerce in 2010 to become a time-honored brand in China, was founded in 1938. It was the first women&#39;s products store in Beijing. It once proposed that Chinese women wear &quot;Hua Nv&quot; underwear. There is no trace of the Chinese lingerie brand that once opened a store on Wangfujing Street. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Linlang Wedding Photography Shop, once located in Shangxiajiu Commercial Street, Guangzhou, was founded in 1947. At that time, it was the largest photography shop in Liwan District where it was located. Now the store has been occupied by sports brands. Granny Chen, who is nearly 80 years old, recalled to Southern Weekend reporters that the previous photo studio was a two-story arcade, which belonged to a high-end consumer brand. She had taken work photos at Linlang Photo Studio in the 1970s, but never wedding photos. One room is used for taking photos, and the outside is used as the lobby. It is relatively high-end and there are quite a lot of people.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;On the eve of the Double Ninth Festival in 2023, citizens and tourists queue up to buy Double Ninth Cake from time-honored brands in Shanghai.

Visual China Map&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Plans to return to the time-honored brand list&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Wu Zhiyong regrets being removed from the time-honored brand list but is not discouraged: “We have learned from the experience and cannot let the brand stay on the family business model. We are confident that the next application (for Chinese time-honored brands) will be successful.&quot; According to the &quot;Measures&quot;, those who have been removed from the list of Chinese time-honored brands are not allowed to apply again within two application cycles from the date of the decision. In other words, Wu Zhiyong cannot declare again until 2032. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, Wu’s bacon business does not seem to be affected. The Chinese Time-honored Brand plaque awarded by the Commerce Department has not yet been notified of its withdrawal. The packaging bags with the &quot;Chinese Time-honored Brand&quot; logo can no longer be used, and there are not many goods left. , the loss is not big. At the end of 2020, Wu Zhiyong and his brother Wu Zhijun raised funds to build a new factory in another location. Today, the factory covering an area of ​​6 acres can produce about 800 kilograms of bacon every day, which is sold by four local stores in a day. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Compared with the productivity of the fourth generation, the area of ​​the new factory has been reduced but the production capacity has been increased. According to Wu Zhiyong, his secret recipe was prepared by his ancestors who were doctors in the third year of Guangxu (1877). During this period, his grandfather improved it once, and it has been used ever since. There are about 22 Chinese herbal medicines in this secret recipe. Different ingredients are used in different seasons. Pork, beef, chicken, rabbit and other ingredients are also different, and even the ingredients used in different parts are different. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wu Zhiyong told Southern Weekend reporters that for many years, the Wu family’s secret recipe for bacon has been dictated. He recalled that he and his younger brother were taken to the batching room by his father. The batching room had no windows and only one door. His father taught them the recipe for cooking pig head meat in summer. They could only memorize it by rote. If they wrote it down on paper, they had to cook it before going out. Lose. Not only that, this recipe can be passed down to sons and daughters-in-law, but not to daughters-in-law. Wu Zhiyong said that all 7 brothers of his father&#39;s generation have completed the inheritance; there are 10 cousins ​​of his generation, and 5 of them are currently running the business; now, the baton is slowly being passed to the hands of the sixth generation. Among this generation, There are 10 males, 9 of whom are minors. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Now, Wu Yazhou, the sixth generation inheritor, has begun to learn how to make ingredients, as well as washing, soaking, pickling, boiling, smoking, drying and other techniques. Wu Zhiyong revealed that Wu Yazhou, who is currently 25 years old, does not fully understand the ingredients of the secret recipe. He will not be able to teach all the secret recipes until he reaches the age of 35 and matures mentally. Another inheritor is Wu Zhiyong’s son Wu Yaxuan. He is still in his second year of high school and has not yet decided whether to inherit the family business. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wu Zhiyong feels that Wu’s bacon, which has lost the title of a time-honored Chinese brand, is not only a food, but also the hard work and bitterness of the older generation, and he wants to carry it forward. Now, the new factory is debugging a high-temperature sterilization flexible packaging production line. After debugging is completed, the products can be launched into foreign markets. Not only that, he plans to introduce live streaming to deliver goods. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On November 9, the day the Ministry of Commerce disclosed the results of the review of Chinese time-honored brands, Ministry of Commerce spokesperson He Yadong said that in 2022, Chinese time-honored brands will achieve operating income of more than 1.2 trillion yuan, and nearly 70% of them will be profitable. . In the first three quarters of 2023, operating income has exceeded the full-year level of 2022. The Ministry of Commerce will work with relevant departments to further establish and improve the long-term mechanism for the protection, inheritance and innovation and development of time-honored brands, promote time-honored brands to dig deep into their cultural heritage, benchmark against advanced concepts, adhere to integrity, innovate and develop, and better play a demonstration role. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 16 Nov 2023 08:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[中山大学通报“贫困生炫富”：终止发放助学金]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260686]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-15 23:46:35&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;On the evening of November 15, the Student Financial Aid Management Center of Sun Yat-sen University issued a briefing on the situation of students from financially disadvantaged families at the school.

In the end, not only was she kicked out, but her own family was also destroyed. , repented before his death. After rebirth, she returned to her wedding night. Unfortunately, she had already done all the bad things, so she had no choice but to turn the tide and make amends for her bad deeds. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/13/81b97614dc7a65dbf1268fc6a908e4ba.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;608&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/13/81b97614dc7a65dbf1268fc6a908e4ba.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;258137&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Ning&#39;an Queen Jiang Xuening in &quot;Like a Dream&quot; was a selfish person in her first life. She was devoted to the position of queen and planned every step, letting down many people who fell in love with her. When the imperial power fell, she lost all hope and committed suicide. After rebirth, she returned to her teenage years, and she still had time to change her life path. Whenever she had to make a choice, she made a different choice from her previous life, not wanting the tragedy to happen again. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/13/74951bcdfcdb2f12eba8eb9212f5b073.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/13/74951bcdfcdb2f12eba8eb9212f5b073.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;258138&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;《Weiyou &quot;Secret Fragrance Comes&quot; and &quot;Ning&#39;an Like a Dream&quot; were respectively adapted from the Zhihu novel &quot;Washing the Leading Flowers&quot; and the Jinjiang novel &quot;Kunning&quot;. The original works were both popular hits. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In online novels, &quot;rebirth novels&quot; are a type that attracts a lot of attention. &quot;Harem stories&quot; and &quot;house fighting stories&quot; are only popular periodically, but &quot;rebirth stories&quot; have a long-lasting momentum, and &quot;Rebirth of Me xxxxxx&quot; has become a popular title template. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to attract readers in the first three golden chapters, some authors even put a &quot;rebirth&quot; shell on ordinary costume romance novels, but this setting has little impact on the subsequent plot. &quot;Pseudo-rebirth literature&quot; is not within the scope of our discussion. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is a term in psychology called &quot;unfinished complex&quot;, which may be used to explain the popularity of rebirth literature. It refers to an individual who, because of something or a situation that has not yet been satisfactorily resolved, especially a trauma, always dwells on it subconsciously, constantly embellishes the unfinished alternative, and then continues to seek compensatory satisfaction in later life. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Therefore, another life trajectory in parallel time and space has attracted countless people&#39;s yearning for it. There is no regret medicine in the world, and no one can start over, so it is better to give this hope to the fictional protagonists in the rebirth novel and let them live again with their own memories. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Being able to repeat such a setting is also very popular in the drama market. Looking at the rebirth dramas in the past two years, they are usually divided into two types: dramas in which villains are reincarnated and reformed, and dramas in which good guys are reborn and revenge. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The rebirth of evildoers is to correct the mistakes in life. This type of drama promotes correct values, highlights the importance of choices, and guides everyone to be kind to others. Just like Andy Lau&#39;s classic line in &quot;Infernal Affairs&quot;, &quot;I didn&#39;t have a choice before, but now I want to be a good person.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The aforementioned &quot;For the Secret Fragrance Comes&quot; and &quot;Ningan is Like a Dream&quot; can both be classified into this category. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The first episode of &quot;The Secret Fragrance Comes&quot; is when Hua Qian&#39;s family was sanctioned and she witnessed the death of her parents. She heard a hazy whisper on the edge of life and death: &quot;If I could have my life over again, Opportunity, will you make a change?&quot; &quot;I will&quot; sets the tone of the whole play. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/13/53329d2a69b1d633f364c8545098effa.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;607&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/13/53329d2a69b1d633f364c8545098effa.png&quot; data-key=&quot;258140&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src =&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/13/a38f9135dfd9bc86e14faee19a7de622.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;624&quot; data-src=&quot;// images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/13/a38f9135dfd9bc86e14faee19a7de622.png&quot; data-key=&quot;258141&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Ning&#39;an Like a Dream&quot; has been added based on the original text A deceptive introduction: A modern female writer was writing a book about the demon queen&#39;s execution (this is the first life), and suddenly decided to change the heroine Jiang Xuening&#39;s character (this is the second life), and wrote &quot;This time, Jiang Xuening&quot; , will never enter the palace again.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/13/c0f57245e9382396f43395d0ca92f7e2.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;597&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/13/c0f57245e9382396f43395d0ca92f7e2.png&quot; data-key=&quot;258142&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src =&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/13/11c564e31885728c60dd3d2caa117307.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;597&quot; data-src=&quot;// images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/13/11c564e31885728c60dd3d2caa117307.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;258139&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It can be said that the lives of Hua Qian and Jiang Xuening are all happy. With the original intention of &quot;doing good&quot;, can you get what you want after being reborn? Is the river of destiny so easy to figure out? The answer is of course no. Along with the &quot;unfinished complex&quot; comes obsession and compulsion. Driven by the mentality of &quot;I have to force myself&quot;, the restarted life may not be perfect. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Remorse brings shame and glory, so Hua Qian becomes humble and polite, seriously acts as the uncle&#39;s wife, and strives to have a good relationship with the people around her. In order to make up for the debt owed to the second female lead in her previous life, Hua Qian also tried her best to bring her relationship with the uncle together. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/13/262921949e592c455bd6625ebff7b358.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;608&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/13/262921949e592c455bd6625ebff7b358.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;258143&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But she changed , everyone&#39;s attitude has also changed accordingly. In the past life, no one loved her despite all the institutions, but in this life, her true love cannot resist the active flattery of all men. The series falls into the cliche emotional line of one woman vs. three men: the wavering uncle, the strategizing head of the family, the loyal and passionate bodyguard, how to choose? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/13/4e82acbecac76ed8705a53bbcc1f02cc.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height= &quot;683&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/13/4e82acbecac76ed8705a53bbcc1f02cc.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;258144&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the other side, Jiang Xuening&#39;s restart of life focuses on avoiding pitfalls. The thunderbolts he stepped on in his previous life are all lessons for his current life. So in the eyes of everyone, this unruly daughter-in-law actually became much smarter in a matter of days. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/13/7505f4c4ef268ac28a56d509fec7f246.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/13/7505f4c4ef268ac28a56d509fec7f246.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;258145&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The male protagonist Xie Wei also began to pay special attention to her. The person who &quot;forced her to commit suicide&quot; in her previous life was destined to suffer another disaster that she could not escape. Coupled with her Bai Yueguang and childhood sweetheart, isn&#39;t this a coincidence? Another emotional line of one woman vs three men. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/13/ec95baf7e5cab7909e66b14c89e25b23.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;457&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/13/ec95baf7e5cab7909e66b14c89e25b23.png&quot; data-key=&quot;258147&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Using Sociology Interpreted from the perspective of Zygmunt Bauman, the expression of individualization is the transformation from the &quot;bearer&quot; of the identity to the &quot;responsible person&quot;. Hua Qian and Jiang Xuening were hateful in their previous lives, but they were also the bearers of a tragic fate. In this life, they opened their eyes wide and began to learn to take on their own rights and responsibilities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the subsequent development of the series still leads to the myth of fatalism. I have heard many truths and learned to be a good person, but I can avoid tragedy A but cannot escape tragedy B. The design of fate can always give people Surprise and shock. TV dramas need such twists and turns to better build dramatic tension, but it also leads to the failure of the audience&#39;s psychological expectations. We actually don&#39;t want to watch a plot that is too sadistic, especially since it is a rebirth drama. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A revenge drama in which a good guy is reborn is actually more in line with the physique of drama fans. A good man who always does good, but falls into the trap of others and steps into the abyss. If he could live again, we would see him kill everyone. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is why &quot;The Temptation of Going Home&quot; will become a classic. Lin Pinru fell and Gao Shanshan stood up. Although it is not a rebirth drama, the psychological roots are the same. As Bacon said, &quot;Revenge is brutal justice&quot;, and the plot of &quot;an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth&quot; is in line with the audience&#39;s imagination of happy grudges. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Last year&#39;s domestic drama &quot;The Lost Years&quot; and the Korean drama &quot;The Youngest Son of the Chaebol Family&quot; were both revenge dramas in which good guys were reborn. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The first three episodes of &quot;The Lost Years&quot; tell the story of the heroine Lu Anran&#39;s past life at 5x speed. She is a good wife, mother, daughter and sister, but she cannot escape the tricks of fate. Reborn in episode 4, she discovers that everything is not accidental, and every step contains the calculation of her husband, so she decides to take revenge on him and seek justice. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/13/74d5d3556cce35ff1aa4174a6170c8d2.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/13/74d5d3556cce35ff1aa4174a6170c8d2.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;258148&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Chaebol Family&quot; In &quot;The Youngest Son&quot;, Song Joong-ki plays a low-level worker from a wealthy family who was killed after draining all his value. After rebirth, he became the grandson of a chaebol family, and the enemies in his previous life are hidden among his relatives in this life. The object of his revenge is not only the concrete person, but also the entire cannibalistic plutocratic constitution. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/13/6600b99e4a3d180fa80d1b13fccd393f.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/13/6600b99e4a3d180fa80d1b13fccd393f.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;258146&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A good man is reborn with revenge The play emphasizes pain and pleasure. In the early stage, the protagonist endured all the way and experienced situations that ordinary people could not bear. The pain was felt both in his body and in the hearts of the audience. The desperate counterattack when being squeezed to the extreme is the highlight, so the audience is looking forward to the golden finger on the road to rebirth. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Disregarding the usual shortcomings of rebirth dramas - shocking endings, &quot;The Last Days&quot; and &quot;The Youngest Son of the Chaebol&quot; had completely different reputations during their broadcasts, with the former being scolded by the audience. &quot;It&#39;s so frustrating and lonely,&quot; but the latter triggered a nationwide craze to watch the drama. Everyone wanted to see how cool it was for the protagonist to control the Korean economy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The root of the problem is: in rebirth and revenge dramas, the word &quot;pleasure&quot; is at the forefront. The audience does not want to think too much, they just want to watch the protagonist&#39;s gorgeous turn. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The male protagonist played by Song Joong-ki was just a pawn of the chaebol family in his previous life. He completed his domestic duties meticulously and took care of the outside affairs. He had no ambitions or desires and only looked forward to the meager amount that was enough to survive. Just a salary.

The tragedy should be an opportunity for the whole society to examine and evaluate the threat level of urban dog breeding to public safety and further promote the improvement of the legal system. Unfortunately, however, relevant discussions on multiple social platforms have gone beyond the incident itself and become an outlet for various emotions and contradictions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are also some people taking advantage of the situation to put forward a series of vague pan-moral views. As one of the ideological cornerstones of traditional Chinese culture, the Confucian sages in the pre-Qin period conducted a series of thoughts on the relationship between &quot;human beings, animals, and society&quot; two thousand years ago, which can help us clarify our thinking and clarify the public opinion field. Some views and opinions on. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The Difference between Humans and Animals&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;As a philosophical thought dating back more than 2,000 years ago, the most valuable part of Pre-Qin Confucianism is undoubtedly its ubiquitous humanism in principle. This point is also very clear in the &quot;Difference between Humans and Animals&quot;. Mencius said: &quot;The creatures of heaven are the same as the basics.&quot; Human beings are the only subjects of moral practice. The difference between humans and animals is that humans have &quot;the intolerance&quot;. &quot;Heart of compassion&quot; and &quot;heart of compassion&quot; are all part of &quot;benevolence&quot;. As the saying goes, &quot;heart of compassion is the origin of benevolence&quot;. &quot;Benevolence&quot; is not only one of the principles of moral practice, but also the highest purpose of moral practice. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For society, all manifestations of &quot;civilization&quot;, whether it is respecting the elderly and caring for the young, protecting vegetation, and being kind to animals, are people as the subject practicing the principle of &quot;benevolence&quot; and pursuing &quot;benevolence&quot;. &quot;One of the results produced during the goal process. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As the master of all things and the only subject in moral practice, man certainly has the right to treat and dispose of &quot;things&quot; in the way he wants. The things here include both inanimate dead things and living things. Living things. &quot;The Analects of Confucius&quot; says, &quot;A fisher does not have a clear outline, and a sailor does not shoot at a perch.&quot; Confucius used a fishing rod to fish, but not a net, and shot birds, but did not kill the birds that returned to their nests to roost. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is a similar discussion in later Confucian classics. A gentleman has the ability to catch all the fish in the lake, but he only catches the parts he needs to eat, and he will no longer catch excessively. The gentleman has the power to hunt in the mountains and forests, but he will not shoot the birds at will just because he wants to show his superb shooting or fun. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Fish did not die because of human greed. Flying birds were not killed because of the rise of humans. The &quot;heart&quot; of fish and flying birds practice the result of &quot;benevolence&quot;. The moral foundation of &quot;benevolence&quot; in the relationship between man and beast lies in the moral consciousness of man and the main object of the human and beasts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; This is not a &quot;equivalent right to survive&quot;, which does not mean that &quot;even if humans cannot deprive animals&#39; living rights even if they are suffering from serious potential threats.&quot; In the ridiculous world of &quot;dogs and foods without food, there are hungry and unknown&quot;, &quot;benevolent&quot; cannot talk about it, and the so -called civilization is just a joke. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>; Renmin love &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; In the &quot;dislike of human poultry&quot;, the relationship between humans and beasts is positioned as the relationship between human beings and things, and there is an insurmountable gap between people and things. Therefore, this relationship must be lower than the relationship between people and people. When discussing the relationship between people and people, people, and things, Mencius said: &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; ; Yu Min also, benevolence and relatives. Kissing and benevolent, benevolent and love. &quot;&lt;/P>; &lt;p>; This sentence means that the gentleman treats things no matter how much he likes, and he will not&quot; benevolent &quot; Priority is given to things, and to the people, although it is reluctant, it will not give love for love. The gentleman&#39;s dear relative will love the people, and the people will love everything. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; This logical relationship is the so -called &quot;love is poor, etc.&quot;, &quot;difference, etc.&quot; is a concentric circle, and the heart is self. Townships, Chinese, and outsiders, the outermost layers are treated as the most basic ethics of human beings, and they are &quot;things&quot; outside the outermost layer. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Animals are treated kindly, and the civilization of human society has reached a certain height. After the guarantee, the &quot;love of badness&quot; finally benefited the results of animals, instead of saying that as long as it is protected and treats animals, society is naturally civilized. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; All emotions that violate this logical relationship are false. For example, some people do not love their families and love their country, do not love people and love outsiders, then his love for people and outsiders is also false. It may be some kind of distorted projection of the hate of family members and people. In the same way, some people claim that they love animals than their lover, and they are likely to be some kind of distorted projection. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; So Mencius asked King Liang Hui: &quot;Today is enough to reach the beasts, and those who do not work as the people, Duhe and your own grace can be applied to animals, but they cannot be applied to the people. Why)? &quot;It is a taunt and criticism. This problem can also be used to question those who claim to love animals than their lover. What is their&quot; love &quot;for animals? Is it selfishness? &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>; Love is poor &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; Another focus of controversy in the &quot;Evil Dog injury incident&quot; is that some people who do not raise dogs advocate the formulation and implementation of strict and effective urban dogs. At the same time, stray dogs that thoroughly clean up and kill the public. And some people who raise dogs think that this is too brutal. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The two have a very different understanding of this issue. It is that the two have completely different feelings for animal projection. For the former who do not raise dogs, they have no feelings for dogs. The latter of the dog is much more complicated. Their emotions can easily spread from their dogs to the dogs of others, and from the dog&#39;s dogs to all dogs (including stray dogs). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The border of unknown and controlling emotions, letting it spread is the cognitive characteristics of immatureness (such as children). &quot;Love is poor, etc.&quot; limits the boundary of human emotions, which avoids the spread of unlimited individual emotions to the greatest extent, and hinders the rights and public rights of individual social individuals. All in all, people are the subject. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The reason why Confucianism can be rooted in traditional Chinese society for two thousand years is basically in the human nature and explain to common sense.

All the audience channels are affixed with color paper to maximize blocking the light into the theater. When the stage lights went out, the audience was immersed in a pure darkness. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; This is the &quot;Dark Theater&quot; created by Dao Jel Pomora. During the scene, a cold white light gradually illuminated the outline of the actor on the empty stage. The streets of the two junior high schools were on both sides of the stage on both sides of the stage. One of the boys suspected that the girl was a robot. He kept provocation and instructed his companion to touch the girl&#39;s chest. Finally, the girl ran away with her late partner. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The light turns dark, and when it is on, the scene has been switched to the company. The latest humanoid robot sitting on the sofa can draw, write, speak, and imitate the &quot;space step&quot; -this Family robots used to accompany young people to learn and play, known as Steven, Robbie, or Eddie. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; A series of stories of adolescents, adults and robots have begun. In the eleven situations, in the strong contrast between the lights and the dark field, it suddenly appeared and stopped abruptly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; During the curtain curtain, the audience discovered that except for an actor who played an adult male, the other Qing Yixi was an actress. The average age is about 35 years old, and some of them have become mothers. On the stage, they alternately play boys, girls and robots. They are wearing sports jackets and jeans, chasing, shouting, raising their hands to exude youthfulness; incarnate robots, from the cold faces, flat hair to stiff movements, and a slightly metallic sound, accurate and real. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Director Assistant Lucia &amp; Nbsp; Trotta told the Southern Weekend reporter that &quot;At first, the director did not intend to do a drama about robots. Planting situation. &quot;Fairy Tale Legend&quot; is a story about human rather than artificial intelligence. It continues the perspective of teenagers in Porara&#39;s past creations, and explores major issues such as human emotional relationships, identity, life and death, and sex. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; As a Chinese script translator and the recommender of Wuzhen Drama, Wang Jing agreed to the drama troupe three years ago and finally brought this French drama to China. &quot;The director was collecting a lot of information in the early stage. He found that the high -tech has a great impact on teenagers and children, so he put this thing related to society in. But the focus is still on people. The robot is just a mirror. Reflect some of the contemporary problems, &quot;she told reporters from the southern weekend. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The last segment in the play, the boy who defeated cancer received a great gift on his birthday -his enthusiastic worship and loved robot star Eddie came to his home to celebrate his birthday for 15 minutes. He was intoxicated in the performance of his idol, and he didn&#39;t know that the brokerage company would destroy the robot soon for market considerations. At the end of the show, Eddie sang and danced, &quot;I want to die on the stage, that is where I was born.&quot; The boy hugged another human boy and slowly paced in the music. &lt;/p>; &lt;H4>; &lt;strong>; &quot;Love&quot; with the robot is a mapping of human loneliness &lt;/strong>; &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; &quot;In this world that adults can&#39;t understand, the lost children hold it tightly and grasp it tightly. The signal of love, even if they come from robots, even if they know they are artificial. &quot;French reporter Jean Luke Polkai commented on the show. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; These 11 to 14 -year -old children rely on their robots in life and even emotion, and the intimacy between the two blurred the original emotions and ethical boundaries of human beings. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The boy sitting in a wheelchair witnessed the process of being destroyed by robot partners. The disability of his legs was caused by a robot error when he was playing with the robot at one time. Even if he lost his legs because of each other, the boy still accompanied the robot to spend its last time. The sentences in the robot population were getting more and more broken, the sound became more and more dumb, and the boy held his hand and hugged it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In another story, human teenagers face the removal of robotic partners&#39; memory. Boys need to sell robots who grew up with themselves, because their parents said that at this stage he needed to change to a &quot;more mature&quot; robot, and the economic constraints at home have to be sold to have new ones. The buyer is a woman with a terminally ill. She decided to find a robot and take care of her children and husband after her death. Her son asked the robot to restore the factory settings, and he did not accept the memory of other people&#39;s homes. Such a requirement made the boy stunned, but he &quot;had to grow up&quot;, and eventually he accepted helplessly. To this end, he apologized and said goodbye to the robot. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; There are many absent parents in the play. There are three robots in a boy&#39;s house to accompany him to write homework and watch TV, and he can&#39;t figure out when the busy parents will go home. Another boy ran to the mall selling robots for consultation. The salesperson repeatedly invited his parents to come, and they never appeared. In the middle of the night, the boy secretly stayed in the mall, threw various weird problems to the robot, and enjoyed this communication until he was taken away by the security guard. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Wang Jing lived in France. When he sent his child to the child, the teacher and parents met. The first thing was to tell them not to let the child come into contact with any screen before the age of 3. &quot;France will pay great attention here, because in the process of growing up, the communication between the tablet and the world, and the personality of the creation of the real world and the exchange with nature, the development of his IQ is not the same. Psychological is also different. &quot;&lt;/P>; &lt;p>; In her opinion, Popolra is talking about the problems we face now. Those who are absent are all handed over to the robot, handed over to high -tech, handed it to the tablet, and handed over to the mobile phone. The ex -girlfriend and robot Stephen established a close relationship. An adult male voice questioned: Is this relationship real and far away from real life? The girl said aloud, &quot;outside, on the bus, not many people will really care about herself.&quot; When she was with Stephen, she could feel its attention. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Robot star Eddie appeared, excited teenagers screamed and wept, and they were ecstatic for his names and what he did. Eddie is the most perfect and competent idol. The name of each fan. Every encounter is engraved in his memory. Each letter gets his intimate reply. In the heart of a cancer boy, he seemed to be a faithful existence, supporting him to live strongly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;I think it will enter a very fragile part of people.&quot; Wang Jing said to the southern weekend reporter, &quot;The adolescents are not understood, the psychological compensation given by AI and our loneliness are all. And artificial intelligence is sometimes better than the response given by real human beings. &quot;After watching the show, more than one audience wrote similar short reviews.&quot; Is it better than that there is no relationship or bad relationship? &quot;&lt; /p>; &lt;p>; &lt;img src = &quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/14/yjzkzl0s0aiuailqzqzra6gkhvp3fvavb.jpg&quot; 0 &quot;width = &quot;960&quot; height = &quot; 640 &quot;data-src =&quot; // Images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/14/yjzkzl0s0aiuailqzqzra6gkhvp3me8to3fvavb.jpg &quot;data-key =&quot; 258241 &quot;>; &lt;/p. >; &lt;p style = &quot;color: #999; Text-Align: Center; &quot;>; Except for an actor who plays an adult male, the other clear is an actress. The average age is about 35 years old, and some of them have become mothers. On the stage, they alternately play boys, girls and robots. &lt;span style = &quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>; (interviewee/picture) &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>; &lt;strong>; adolescence that is not chilling &lt;/strong>; &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; The lights are bright From the beginning, a boy wearing a white dress and scolding appeared from the darkness. His mother entered the mental hospital. He wore her skirt and taught his brother and sister to sleep. When his father wanted to send the little children to the Volunteer Office, he decided to take the role of his mother in the family. He scolded angrily for his father&#39;s choice. However, the audience would see that after he asked a 13 -year -old girl to get pregnant, the girl called to communicate. He hung up the phone rudely and continued to clean up the endgame in the family. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;On the one hand, he wants to bear the responsibility of his mother&#39;s mother on the one hand, but at the same time throw his own responsibility. You will find the polyanability of human nature, and the tangles, complexity and uncertainty of adolescence, and the tangles, complexity and uncertainty of adolescence. . &quot;When translating the script, Wang Jing was moved by Polora&#39;s observation of young people and family relations, especially when he showed these on the stage, he did not judge, but just showed various possibilities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The adolescent picture of a contemporary society is presented in a restrained and sharp way. In the 21st century, teenagers grew too quickly. In the face of acceleration of adult problems, they should have belonged to their innocence, childishness, and carefree. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Both French media described the perception of &quot;Fairy Tale Legend&quot; with &quot;not chilling&quot;. Adolescent restlessness and suffocation stir up the peaceful atmosphere in the theater from time to time. The teenagers sprayed a lot of vulgar abuse with a clear voice. Sex, marriage, violence, death, identity, and discussions around these major issues are not covered by the protagonist because of their children. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Starting from the first scene, in the confrontation of girls and boys, gender issues have emerged, and the key theme of this adolescence runs through the whole scene. The gender concept of &quot;Fairy Tale Legend&quot; has gone further. What is pointing behind is whether gender identity is just a slow social construction as the theory of gender theory? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; So the audience will see some ambiguous scenes. In order to escape the surveillance of the girl&#39;s brother, the boy put on the women&#39;s clothing. Although the girl was surprised, she quickly accepted it. The pair sitting on the sofa surpassed the stereotypes and prejudice related to the strange costume, and successfully talked about love. On the other side, my brother converted from the girl who was admired from the girl to a boy&#39;s robot, and shook God in romantic music. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In the play, in the future, in the future world, the patriarchal values ​​are warmly defended. People hate homosexuality. Boys in adolescents participate in training camps to enhance their masculinity. Before the camp, the coach delivered a speech: &quot;Today, the goal of our enemies is no longer equal to men and women, but the overall feminine of society. If we do not take all possible means to fight, if we do not take any measures to protect us True humanity, then these principles will shape our future. &quot;This&quot; oral hormone &quot;stimulates the&quot; lack of man&#39;s spirit &quot;, where they regard feminine as enemies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Boy Camiye has a feminine name and gentle temperament, and is incompatible in the training camp. Except for him, all the boys have passed pressure training -in the face of the negation and malicious gaze in the opposite side, they can report it with tough viewing. The boys dismissed him for him and even attacked him. In the end, Camier cried angrily and said that he just didn&#39;t want war. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Actor Lucid &amp; Nbsp; Grunstein plays Camiye in the play. She told the southern weekend reporter that &quot;a group of people exclude a person, which makes me feel uneasy.&quot; To her In terms of, this play is very heavy. &lt;/p>; &lt;H4>; &lt;strong>; &quot;Stage Creation&quot; and &quot;Dark Theater&quot; &lt;/strong>; &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; The group play of the male style training camp is the most enjoyable actress who plays the boys. A show. Scolding, roaring, siege, pushing, even in the darkness of the actor, the stage was still like a pan on the stage. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; They released their observations and imaginations of adolescent boys. Without their own enthusiasm, they felt that they had a particularly great degree of freedom. During the rehearsal, their performance even walked too far, and Pomora had to pull them back. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The collective creative method of the Louis · Mist Troupe has given actors a great creative freedom. After completing a large amount of data collection, Porara brought these basic materials to do improvisation with the team. Without writing a well -written script in advance, he will only give a situation, such as the boy to sell his robot. The actor&#39;s improvisation is like white paper, the direction and plot of the story gradually grow, and then to the details such as lines and movements. Polora will allow actors to exchange characters, such as actors who act as robots, and play the boy who sells robots, so as to stimulate the actor to fully understand the things behind each role and find more possibilities. The actors created very deeply, &quot;Every role we play has our own shadow, and at the same time, this character has also hit the role of this character.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The process of generating the story of the story is intertwined with the stage design such as scenery, lighting, sound, etc. This &quot;stage creation&quot; is a unique way to work in Pomola. He likes to call himself &quot;drama creation&quot; rather than &quot;director&quot; or &quot;screenwriter&quot;. He does not want everyone to think that the screenwriter and director are two division of labor. In his creation, the stage and text are generated simultaneously, and the adjustment is adjusted according to the rehearsal of the actors. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;Dark Theater&quot; is another original place of Polora and the troupe. They make good use of the darkness and psychological response to the visual and psychological response, making the power of narrative more condensed and full, and the stage style of &quot;less is more&quot;, implicit and precise lighting, together to form a unique temperament of its theater. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;A scene suddenly lights up in front of you. Then the light it uses the light is relatively darker, not like sometimes we will see a variety of lights on the show, giving you sensory stimulus . It may enter a slightly subtle level, details, and accurate places, but it is very strong and strong at the same time. &quot;Wang Jing said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Polora puts his expectations in the name of the troupe. Louis comes from the name of his father, and it also means light. The fog symbolizes his exploration of the unknown world and also represents his aesthetic pursuit of drama. His works emphasize that the world is not black or white, and human nature is not distinction between good and evil. In a complex and diverse situation, the audience just feels and experiences the vagueness of different existence methods and truth. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In the 33 years since its establishment, the Louis Mist Troupe has created and toured 34 dramas and staged more than 4,000. In 2019, the &quot;Little Red Hat&quot; of the Louis Wushu Troupe was staged at the Beijing Tianqiao Art Center. It was the first time that Pomora&#39;s work came to the mainland of China to perform. After a lapse of four years, &quot;Fairy Tale Legend&quot; came to the Wuzhen Drama Festival as the closing drama. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; After the performance, some Chinese audiences asked if they would tour in the country in the future. Wang Jing said that this may be minimal. The first is the reason for the schedule. The troupe touches hundreds of games in various countries each year and needs to make an appointment at least two years in advance. The second is that the work has high requirements for the stage and the theater is difficult to achieve. Once again, Polora has extremely high requirements for the stage. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Wang Jing recalled: &quot;Can this play come to Wuzhen at the beginning? We have a meeting with the technical team in advance. French technical director is very clear. I don&#39;t want the performance to be cut. &quot;&lt;/P>; &lt;p>; The theater cannot exceed 450 people. Porara refused to perform in the large theater of thousands of people.&quot; The director pays special attention to the audience. Can be seen clearly. &quot;Wang Jing explained to reporters in the southern weekend.&quot; Many theaters in China are still on the basis of profitability. There are less than a thousand or two thousand people. /p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 15 Nov 2023 21:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[醉驾女子反诬交警“猥亵”：如此虚假指控，“灵感”从何而来？丨快评]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260647]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;i>; 2023-11-15 20:00:00 &lt;/i>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>; Recent During the test, the woman said that she would &quot;obscene&quot; the traffic police.

But there are still many things that are worthy of in -depth discussions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; One of them, from the perspective of the case in this case, in addition to the crime of dangerous driving, the woman in the case is also suspected of other illegal crimes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The alcohol content in the women&#39;s blood has exceeded 80mg/100ml, which is drunk driving. Its behavior also violates the Road Traffic Safety Law of the People&#39;s Republic of China and the Criminal Law of the People&#39;s Republic of China. According to Article 91 of the Road Traffic Safety Law, those who are drunk driving motor vehicles shall be restricted by the traffic management department of the public security organs until they wake up, revoke the motor vehicle driving license, and investigate criminal responsibility in accordance with the law; Article 133, those who drunk motor vehicles on the road are detained and fined. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; If the woman in the case is just drunk and only rear -end, then the punishment for her may be limited to revocation of driver&#39;s licenses, detention and fines, and compensate the losses of the car owner at the same time. The problem is that other behaviors of the woman on the scene were also suspected of illegal crimes. Her sentence &quot;I want to sue you to obscene&quot;. This is public accusation for individuals in public, so you must be responsible for the authenticity of the allegations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The video screen clearly shows that the traffic police on duty are in normal law enforcement. It is reasonable to suspect that the owner of the rear -end owner is suspected of drinking and driving, and requires them to receive alcohol inspection, which is fully performing official duties. According to the &quot;Regulations on the Regulations on the Law Enforcement Work of Traffic Police Road&quot;, the attachment &quot;Investigate and deal with the driving operation procedures&quot;, the traffic police have the right to &quot;get off the car to get alcohol inspection for drivers of motor vehicles suspected after drinking.&quot; Therefore, the public charges of a woman in the event should be a non -fake false allegation and should bear the corresponding legal liability. When you are young, this is slandering and slander, and it is big to say that this is even framed, because the woman in the case also said, &quot;I want to sue you.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Article 42 of the &quot;Punishment Law of the People&#39;s Republic of China&quot; stipulates that &quot;openly insulted others or fabricated the facts to slander others&quot; &quot;fabricate facts to confess to framed others, in an attempt to cause others to be criminally investigated or in public security &quot;Management punishment is an illegal act, and punishment should be detained and fined. Article 243 of the Criminal Law also stipulates that the fabrication of the facts to framed others, intending to cause others to be held criminally investigating and constituted a crime of framing. If the circumstances are serious, in prison, detention or control of less than three years, the imprisonment of less than three years or less than ten years caused serious consequences. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Second, the social phenomenon behind this case is even more worrying, that is, some people use specific identities and words to bypass the &quot;gameplay&quot; behavior of seeking privileges for themselves. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The women&#39;s conditional reflex &quot;sue you&quot;, which shows that similar thinking fixed formulas have penetrated the bone marrow, that is, the use of enlightenment words to implement threats and bypass the rules of the law for self -punishing privileges. The &quot;inspiration&quot; brought by the &quot;sexual assault&quot;, &quot;rape&quot;, and &quot;online small composition&quot;, I am afraid that it has long been internalized into the party&#39;s thinking. &quot;Noise&quot; accuses the other party, so entering can be extorted, and retreat can be divorced. And even if the words fail, they will not suffer any punishment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; It is even more worrying that if there is no video screen testing in this case, can the woman in the case of a matter be insulted by the traffic police, and then the traffic police on duty? Can the woman in the case of a traffic policeman be on duty and the benefits of sin for themselves? It seems that as long as it is so troubled, others and even public power must &quot;let me&quot;, which is a trample on justice. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Third, more seriously, the object of false accusations of the woman in the case is the national public official, which is the authority of the law enforcement of the police. According to Article 8 of the &quot;Regulations on the Work of Maintaining the Law Enforcement of Police Police&quot;, the police encountered the police in the process of performing their duties in accordance with the law or exercising their powers in accordance with the law. In the case of harassment, the public security organs should actively maintain the authority of the police&#39;s law enforcement. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Therefore, if you do not seriously deal with the women in the case and investigate other illegal crimes other than the crime of dangerous driving, it will inevitably bring negative incentives to similar behaviors, stimulate more illegal generations, and even the law, or even even Continue to implement analogy to create obstacles to the police&#39;s normal law enforcement, which is by no means a blessing of public interest. This case is still under investigation and handling, and it should also be a justice on the police to deter the people who have worked with their attempts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 15 Nov 2023 20:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[浙江慈溪首富惹麻烦：原高管未能兑现股权激励，举报上市公司危废风险]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260676]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;i>; 2023-11-15 19:00:00 &lt;/i>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>; &lt;img alt = &quot;August 30, 2023, Shanghai International Electric Power Component, Renewable Energy Management Exhibition Fair It is held at the Pudong New National Exhibition Center, and there is a booth in He Shengsilia.

If he joined the month of his departure from He Sheng Silicon, he joined the same industry company Xinyaqiang (603155.SH) as deputy general manager and held 2.81 million shares. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Fang Hongcheng has really tried to do so. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Xinyaqiang&#39;s prospectus shows that the company signed a labor contract with Fang Hong on December 20, 2018, agreed to hire Ren Fang Hongcheng as the company&#39;s deputy general manager without the conditions of office.

According to the estimated stock price of He Shengsilian at the time, Fang Hongcheng could make up to more than 81 million yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>; Hidden hazards of hazardous waste treatment &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; On November 22, 2022, He Shengsilia Industry announced that the company&#39;s former director and general manager Fang Hongcheng was investigated by the public security organs for suspected occupation and ended in the public security organs. Transfer to the procuratorate for review and prosecution, and the criminal acts involved occurred during the company&#39;s office. The case was discovered and reported to the public security organs internally. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; This incident leads the hidden dangers of the treatment of hazardous waste products in Hesheng. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; According to the relevant research papers, in the production of silicon, a mixture composed of by -products with a boiling point of less than 40 ° C is called low -boiling objects, most of which are tetramililane Silicide, siosarioxane, chloride chloride, etc. The low -boiling group is very close, so it is difficult to separate and use it. These compounds are flammable and explosive. Among them, tetramidal silicane is included in the national &quot;Dangerous Chemicals List&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The prospectus of Hesheng Silicon Industry and the semi -annual report in 2023 disclosed that the low -boiling materials of the by -products are the main solid waste of the company, which strictly implements foreign sales. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; According to Fang Hongcheng&#39;s self -reporting and the materials provided by his family members, in 2011, He Sheng Shengsine Industry was in trouble, and it was urgent to carry out technical transformation and reduce costs. Because the transformation of the production technology of hazardous chemicals involved government approval, Luo Liguo decided that all newly -built and reconstructed projects were fast and policies to grab time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Fang Hongcheng listed 8 projects that were newly built and reconstructed at the time of illegal regulations at that time. above. One of the projects is in the closed system, which is relatively securely disposed of in low -boiling substances that are qualitatively halted, turning it into a relatively stable &quot;hydrolysis oil&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The above materials say that &quot;hydrolysis oil&quot; is the name of He Sheng Silicon industry.
