However, research by physicists has shown that, corresponding to matter, there is antimatter in the universe, and they have been exploring this for nearly a hundred years. On September 27, 2023, the ALPHA collaboration group at CERN published a paper in Nature, announcing their latest research results on antimatter. In their experiments, they found that antihydrogen atoms would fall freely under the influence of gravity, which is the same way that matter moves under the influence of gravity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Jeffrey Hangst, spokesman for the ALPHA collaboration, professor of physics at Aarhus University in Denmark and one of the corresponding authors of the paper, said: &quot;This is the first time that direct The experimental observation of the effect of gravity on the motion of antimatter is a milestone in the history of antimatter research.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;The Mystery of Antimatter&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In 1928, British physicist Paul Dirac proposed the Dirac equation, predicting the existence of antimatter. In his theory, there is a particle that has the same properties as electrons except that it is electrically opposite to electrons. This particle was later named positron. In 1932, American physicist Carl Anderson discovered the positron predicted by Dirac in an experiment, for which he won the 1936 Nobel Prize in Physics. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After antimatter was discovered, physicists began to study the properties of antimatter and think about the relationship between antimatter and gravity. In 1915, Einstein proposed the general theory of relativity, establishing the most successful theory of gravity to date. From the observation of a solar eclipse in 1919 to the discovery of gravitational waves in 2015, the predictions of general relativity have been continuously confirmed over a century and have withstood the test of a series of experiments. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When Einstein proposed the general theory of relativity, physicists including him did not know the existence of antimatter. But in general relativity, objects of the same mass experience the same gravitational pull, regardless of their intrinsic structure or properties. Therefore, matter and antimatter should experience the same gravitational pull. Some past experiments have shown that gravity acts equally on matter and antimatter, but these experiments only proved this indirectly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For decades, physicists have hoped to study this problem through direct experiments. The ALPHA collaboration team completed such a direct experiment this time. Before Einstein, Newton established a successful theory of gravity. The story that he was hit by a falling apple and came up with the law of universal gravitation is a well-known story. Although this is just a story, the question physicists hope to study in this experiment can be understood as: In a world composed of antimatter, would an apple still fall and hit Newton? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Physicists explore the movement of antimatter under the influence of gravity, and also hope to answer a key question related to the evolution of the universe. According to the Big Bang theory, equal amounts of matter and antimatter should have been produced when the Big Bang occurred. However, these matter and antimatter did not undergo annihilation but were all converted into energy, and we live in a universe today that is almost entirely composed of matter. This is known as the &quot;matter-antimatter asymmetry mystery&quot; and is one of the biggest mysteries in physics today. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Based on the general theory of relativity, most physicists believe that antimatter and matter should have the same behavior under the influence of gravity; however, some physicists support the antigravity theory and believe that antimatter does not move in the direction of matter under the influence of gravity. Instead of falling down, it flew upward in the opposite direction. In this way, at the beginning of the formation of the universe, matter and antimatter would move in opposite directions under the influence of gravity. After 13.8 billion years of evolution, the existence of antimatter will not be detected in the universe we live in today, so we can Solve the mystery of matter-antimatter asymmetry. Therefore, if physicists directly observe the difference between the motion of antimatter under gravity and the difference between matter in experiments, they will obtain important clues to solve this problem and even trigger a subversive revolution in physics. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/16/K7ailcllYDo1AWdMUCbOt5Pwgf9hTsY5dPD2VcPs.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/16/K7ailcllYDo1AWdMUCbOt5Pwgf9hTsY5dPD2VcPs.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254167&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Staff are installing the ALPHA-g instrument. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(CERN/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Making antimatter&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The most common thing with Newton Like the famous &quot;story&quot;, Galileo, the pioneer of gravity theory, completed the experiment of two iron balls falling to the ground at the same time at the Leaning Tower of Pisa, thereby overturning Aristotle&#39;s law of falling bodies. This is also a story fabricated by later generations. However, if you want to study the motion of antimatter under the influence of gravity, physicists will naturally think of using a falling object experiment to examine whether antimatter follows the same laws of gravity as matter. However, although this idea is theoretically feasible, it is very difficult in experiments. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is a gravitational force between any two objects with mass. Among the four known basic forces in nature, gravity is the force with the longest range and therefore plays the most important role in the evolution of the universe and the interaction of celestial bodies. However, gravity is the weakest force among the four forces. For particles with extremely small masses, the effect of gravity is minimal. For example, for an antiproton, the force exerted by an electric field of 1V/m is 40 trillion times greater than the gravitational force exerted by the Earth. Therefore, if charged antimatter particles are used as experimental objects, it is almost impossible to complete experiments to test the effect of gravity. Researchers can only choose electrically neutral antimatter particles. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Antihydrogen atom is the antimatter corresponding to the hydrogen atom, consisting of a positron surrounding an antiproton. It is both the simplest antimatter atom and an electrically neutral and stable antimatter particle. These properties make antihydrogen atoms the best choice for studying the gravitational behavior of antimatter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Currently, physicists obtain antimatter particles in the laboratory. For example, the particles produced in high-energy particle collisions all appear in pairs, with one matter particle corresponding to one antimatter particle. But combining antimatter particles together to form antiatoms is very difficult because antimatter particles usually have very short lifespans. When an antimatter particle meets its corresponding matter particle, they annihilate and are converted into energy. In a world made of matter, it would be difficult for antimatter particles to meet and combine into antiatoms. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Therefore, although antihydrogen atoms are the simplest antimatter atoms, currently only CERN in the world can create antihydrogen atoms, where physicists use the Antihydrogen Laser Physics Instrument. Physics Apparatus, ALPHA) conducts research on antimatter. Researchers from the ALPHA collaboration obtained antiprotons through high-speed proton collisions. After that, a speed reducer called ELENA can slow down the antiprotons enough for physicists to proceed. At CERN, several experiments studying antimatter rely on ELENA to provide easily controllable antiprotons, including this experiment. At the same time, they collected positrons from the radioactive source. Next, they combined the two to create antihydrogen atoms. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Falling Antimatter&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;After obtaining the antihydrogen atoms, the researchers pushed them into a 3-meter-high shaft, a device called As ALPHA-g, where &quot;g&quot; represents the acceleration due to gravity. The shaft is surrounded by superconducting electromagnetic coils to prevent antimatter from coming into contact with matter and causing annihilation. The researchers allowed the hotter antihydrogen atoms in the shaft to escape, so that the antihydrogen gas in the shaft became cooler, only 0.5°C above absolute zero. The remaining antihydrogen atoms move very slowly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Next, the researchers gradually weakened the magnetic field at the top and bottom of the shaft, which is equivalent to opening the lid and bottom of a jar. When antihydrogen atoms escape and annihilate, the researchers used two sensors to measure where the annihilation occurred. In the experiment, they trapped about 100 antihydrogen atoms at a time in the shaft and then released them over 20 seconds by gradually reducing the current in magnets at the top and bottom of the shaft. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In our daily life, if a gas container is opened, the gas inside will escape in all directions. However, the antihydrogen atoms are moving very slowly at this time. If antimatter and matter are subject to the same form of gravity, then the earth&#39;s gravity will have an obvious effect at this moment: most of the antihydrogen atoms should escape from the bottom, and a small number will escape from the bottom. The top escapes. Computer simulations show that for matter, this operation would result in about 20 percent of the atoms escaping from the top of the shaft, and about 80 percent from the bottom. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The researchers conducted seven experiments in this study. In each experiment, the size of the bias magnetic field was different. This magnetic field can either strengthen or cancel gravity. By averaging the results of seven experiments, the ALPHA collaboration found that the ratio of antihydrogen atoms escaping the shaft from the top to the bottom was consistent with simulations. After calculation, they gave a value of 0.75 ± 0.29 g for the gravitational acceleration experienced by antihydrogen atoms, where g is the local gravitational acceleration. Therefore, they concluded that within the current measurement accuracy, the acceleration of antihydrogen atoms is consistent with the acceleration of matter caused by Earth&#39;s gravity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2010, the team led by Hanst successfully trapped antihydrogen atoms for the first time in history. In 2016, they successfully measured how antiatoms absorb light. But the complexity of the gravity experiment is unprecedented. As he said: &quot;This is the most difficult thing we have done so far.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although there are still certain errors in this experiment, the researchers believe that, They can at least conclusively rule out the possibility that gravity has a repulsive effect on antimatter, which means that the antigravity theory cannot be established. From this we can confirm that in the world of antimatter, the apple also falls downward, and may hit the &quot;Newton&quot; in that world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The ALPHA collaboration team plans to conduct more precise measurements in 2024, with an accuracy that will reach 100 times that of this experiment. &quot;We&#39;ve spent 30 years learning how to make antiatoms, how to make them persist, and how to control them well enough so that we can make them fall under the influence of gravity,&quot; Hanst said. &quot;The next step is to make them as possible as possible Accurately measure this acceleration. We hope to verify that both matter and antimatter fall in the same way.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The results announced by the ALPHA collaboration team this time are an expected discovery, but as Han &quot;This is still a landmark achievement,&quot; Ste said. Physics is an experimental science, and verifying theoretical conjectures through experiments is the core part of it. Through this experiment, physicists not only verified previous conjectures, but also laid an important foundation for the study of neutral antimatter. In the study of antimatter starting from this starting point, some unexpected discoveries may be made, thereby rewriting our understanding of the formation and evolution of matter and antimatter, and truly solving one of the biggest mysteries in physics. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 16 Oct 2023 17:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[迄今最全面的人类脑细胞图谱丨科创要闻]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258680]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-16 15:20:07&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/16/YITFib0yT0s4rxY2Bs1TS5zYtbV9xqDzqrtGnZze.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1408&quot; height=&quot;698&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/16/YITFib0yT0s4rxY2Bs1TS5zYtbV9 xqDzqrtGnZze. png&quot; data-key=&quot;254152&quot; data-mce-width=&quot;0&quot; data-mce-height=&quot;0&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;&lt;strong>;Technical News&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;p >;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/collections/brain-cell-census&quot;>;&lt;strong>;【01】The most comprehensive human brain cell atlas to date&lt;/strong>;&lt;/a>;&lt;/p >; &lt;p>;On October 13, &quot;Science&quot; released the special topic &quot;Brain&amp;nbsp;Cell&amp;nbsp;Census&quot;, and 21 research papers were simultaneously published in &quot;Science&quot; and its sub-journal &quot;Science&amp;nbsp&quot; Advances) and Science Translational Medicine (12, 8, and 1 articles were published respectively), sharing the most comprehensive brain cell atlas of human and non-human primates to date. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These results come from the &quot;Brain Project-Cell Census Network&quot; project, abbreviated as BICCN (BRAIN&amp;nbsp;Initiative&amp;nbsp; Cell&amp;nbsp;Census&amp;nbsp;Network).

We have been taught since childhood that it is a virtue to have the courage to face mistakes and correct them. However, in real life, some people regard virtue as a broom. Not only do they not correct their mistakes, but they also make them knowingly and add to their mistakes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It rained in the afternoon, so I went to take the bus and found that the seat I wanted to sit in was occupied by a wet umbrella, so I had to find another seat. The same thing happened to the passengers who came up later. They wanted to sit in that seat but had to find another seat when they saw an umbrella. One of the old men had difficulty moving and had to stumble to the last row to sit down. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The sight of the old man walking with difficulty made people feel pitiful. An old man couldn&#39;t stand it anymore and asked the umbrella owner why he didn&#39;t pick up the umbrella. The umbrella owner explained that there were no other passengers when she got on the bus. She was answering the phone at the time, so she conveniently placed the umbrella on the seat. The old man continued to question, saying that the umbrella was wet and it was common sense not to put it on the seat. The owner of the umbrella argued again and again that the seat was wet anyway and he couldn&#39;t sit on it. The two argued over and over again. After the surrounding passengers lined up for the old man, the umbrella owner suddenly changed her face and said arrogantly that she could put her umbrella wherever she wanted and that it was none of the old man&#39;s business. She also mocked the old man for not being able to afford an umbrella. Fortunately, the surrounding passengers reconciled the situation and the bus happened to arrive at the platform where the old man got off, otherwise a bigger dispute might have erupted between the two parties. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the old man got off the bus, the old man sitting in the last row criticized him for being meddlesome, and some of his words were unpleasant. This really surprised the passengers. The old man obviously complained about the grievance when he saw that he was also an elderly man and had difficulty moving. Unexpectedly, he didn&#39;t appreciate it and even stabbed him.伞主见有人帮腔，又讲起她放伞的理由，强调自己在外面一直是个讲规矩的人。直到有乘客问她伞买票了吗，她才闭嘴，但是仍然不把伞拿起来。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;很小的一件事，相信换作多数人，在被提醒不该把伞放在座位上时，会立刻把伞拿起来。一个简单的动作，就可以避免一场火药味十足的争执，伞主为什么不肯呢？上车时没有其他乘客，伞放在座位上不碍事，觉得放伞有理，这是她的第一个解释。这也是有些人在面对自身错误时的第一反应，不是立即纠错，而是从自己的角度、立场和维护自身利益出发，为错误寻找合理化理由。理由越充分，越能自圆其说，越觉得应该被理解，甚至自认为没有错，自然谈不上纠错。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;认为座位已经被打湿不能坐，是伞主的第二个解释。既成事实无法改变，表面上看有道理，其实隐含着高高在上的傲慢。这种傲慢，与环境塑造有关。从小到大，孩子向父母认错、学生向老师认错、员工向领导认错、下级向上级认错常见，反之不常见。强者有理、上位者有理的潜意识根深蒂固。从伞主后来的言语，可以看出她优越感十足的傲慢，那就是我的伞放在座位上很正常，你们谁都没有权利说我。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;认错改错需要勇气，发现错误指出错误更需要勇气。魏征直言进谏的历史典故流传至今，我们也知道“人生得一诤友足矣”。然而在现实生活中，人们喜欢鲜花与掌声，远胜于良药与批评声。纠错者往往是孤独的，因为他们的挺身而出，不仅让犯错者错无可藏心生怨恨，还反衬出旁观者、受益者的懦弱卑怯，令其心生羞愧。老者的批评，便是例证。如果老大爷听见了他的话，下一次还会挺身而出纠错吗？纠错者少了，犯错者就会多起来，以至于身在错中不知错，是非不分。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;每个人都有缺点，没有人是完美的。出错不要紧，错误本身就是成长的一部分。无论孩子还是家长，学生还是老师，员工还是领导，下级还是上级，出现了错误，勇敢直面错误，真诚改正就好。给纠错者以坚定的支持，给改错者以真诚的鼓励，错误才能生发出滋养美德的力量。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;（作者为西南地区事业单位人员）&lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方人物周刊：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;只能说明这个事情你真是特别喜欢。作为一个理性的人，你能对航海付出这么多，对你来说，这样真是已经疯狂到极致了。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;徐京坤：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;对，是这样的。现在过的生活完全是一种疯狂状态。2015年单人小船跨大西洋后，其实在国内就已经算是很顶级的了，当时在深圳一个游艇俱乐部做副总，收入和待遇都非常棒。放着好日子不过，2017年到2020年，跟阿九一起完成了为期三年的环球航行。结束后我们在海南也过得挺不错的，我又有了参加旺代环球的目标。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方人物周刊：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;青岛航海人才很多，在你前面已经有好几位传奇人物，为什么你能越走越远，特别是从2022年开始自己的世界顶级职业赛船船长之路？&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;徐京坤：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;我是一个“笨人”！一方面我很理性，还有一方面我不会想太多有的没的，当我觉得一个事儿很好，值得去做，我就不会想做了这个没做那个如何如何，不做这个去做那个怎样怎样……&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我买了IMOCA60赛船后，开始回过味来了，因为理性开始分析了：咱一个普通农民家庭出身的人，每年不赚这些钱，还花这么多钱……就这种。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;那个船光从岸上吊到水里，下水就要15000欧元，所以没有什么试乘试驾。钱付了，我第一次上船，真的感觉不真实，跟我以前开过的所有船都不是一个概念。那个船在海面上飞的时候，让我见识到为什么它被称为世界最顶级的赛船，“我终于站到了这条船上，这条船属于我们了！”心里这种感受刚升起来，下一秒就感觉到好大的压力，这条超级赛船好多的缆绳配件，真的很难在短时间内去学会，而且一个操作失误就会造成巨大的损失。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我一看太复杂了，心想这根本搞不定啊，接手后就没有离开那条船，就在码头上停着，天天研究，两个月后才自己独自出海。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我不是很聪明的人，而且我很健忘，怎么也想不清楚当初买船的时候咋想咋算的。算了咱不想了，明天再说，明天又忘了这些事了，你又不想了。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我喜欢机械的东西，对船可能有一点天赋吧。我们那个赛船特别复杂，欧洲很多船长都是有工程师学位的，同时还配有团队和教练，我就一个人去买的船。我初中都没有毕业，英语也是自学的，但是我不怵，花点儿时间我都能弄明白。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;大部分时间我和赛船一起的感受都是愉快的，只是它太贵了，维修保养的账单都很昂贵。每次付账单的时候我很心疼，但我的理性就告诉我，赶紧付了得了，然后又忘了这个不开心了哈哈。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/x2HEJrLwLBk7baJ6HnQgmSBo8lwDGmiNb3L1ZLHG.jpg&quot;

&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;徐京坤：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;我和大海之间是什么感情连接，我真得想一想。很长一段时间，我其实已经没有时间思考了，这种状态让我特别不舒服。海上航行是我的工作，我自己是喜欢这个项目的，但是这个事情现在确实让我很累，想到要回法国，我心里会有点抗拒，那边就像一个战场一样。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我想要找到一个理性的原因，我不想轻易地说出来我为什么喜欢和为什么不喜欢。我需要想一想，我想找到一个真正的让我自己觉得能接受的答案。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方人物周刊：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;环球航行和极限越洋竞赛完全不是一回事，极限竞赛你面对的是资金和速度的多重压力，还有竞赛策略的制定和执行，不能像环球航行那样去享受远航和大海。有过三年环球航行的幸福体验，是否会在现在这个高压阶段反哺你，让你始终对大海和航行有感情，不至于全是大赛带来的压力和消耗？&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;徐京坤：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;的确是。在天海之间行船是非常美好的享受，去过那么多海面连接的地方，看到的体验到的，都会让人觉得美好。但我其实可能还更喜欢极限航行比赛这种具体的目标感，让我一直漂在海上，我也会不满足。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我是一个完美主义者，还有点英雄主义。我不是说要做一个人拯救地球的那种超级英雄，我想做自己的小小英雄。在极限航行中顶住压力，跨越大海，每次完成回来，我会觉得我是一个小小的英雄。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;对于我来讲，从赛季开赛前的艰苦准备、开赛后的承受高压，到最后到岸时的那种释放，是我最享受的一个过程。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/PRfAyTagmNJJWaGCsrssaVZ8gjAGh0PyPOXZ40sm.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;

&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;徐京坤：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;航海拓展了我的身体能力和意志，我的身体特别好，都是在极限要求中发展出来的。我能感觉到自己身体的强大适应性和康复能力，身体的极限在极限环境中被激发出来了。这也是我特别喜欢航海的原因，我能感觉自己是人类中的强者，对我来说，这令我内心更加强大。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;航海不是浪漫向往或者一味勇猛就行的，要完成极限挑战，还要把赛船平安地带回来，要上岸给等待的家人一个拥抱。出发前需要做很多具体艰苦的工作让赛船有一个完美的状态，任何问题都要考虑到，有两套甚至更多预备应急方案。航海让我养成了超强的执行力，“说到做到”，目标有多高，自己就付出更多的努力，这个也刻在我骨子里了。凡事认真，绝对不会说说就算了。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;经历过独自航行的孤独和风浪后，我更加喜欢日常生活，发自内心地爱自己的环境和朋友。就像现在这样平静安稳、没有风暴的日常，都让人珍惜，让人想要赞美美好的天气和美好的氛围。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方人物周刊：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;你有过非常孤单艰难的日子，青少年时代常有一种走投无路要掉到底层的恐惧和无望。2012年独自启航开始环中国海的时候，抱着大不了一死的念头，心里很多愤懑。这么多年航行，你跟自己和命运都和解了吗？&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;徐京坤：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;2012年那时候真的是带着一种跟命运赌气的感觉，心里有种壮士一去不复还的那种悲壮，甚至也带着一些怨念，说为什么我这个人一辈子要这么难，你们不相信我就拼死一搏，我要让这个事情去发生，对，带着这种劲。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;现在这些都被医治了，完成一个一个目标对我来讲很重要，你慢慢知道自己是可以掌握自己的命运的。小时候在农村，我又少了半条胳膊，周围真的是一个没有目标、生活漫无目的的环境。你不知道你的目标在哪，你也从来没有达成过一个目标，你会厌恶那个懦弱又不堪一击的自己，渴望充满斗志和勇气。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;通过航海，我有了一个又一个目标，这也是自我医治和成长的过程。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;从我用7个多月修好了一条要报废的小船，把它命名为“梦想号”，并且实现了环中国海这第一个目标后，我学会了相信自己、相信梦想。其实如果那一次失败，可能我这一辈子也不会再起来了，可能就彻底被打垮了，不光是被外界的东西打垮了，自己那道防线也没了。现在回头看，真的也觉得当时别人说我不切实际是可以理解的，自己可以说太幸运了，那个开始让我学会了相信，这种信念帮助我一步步走到现在。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方人物周刊：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;离岸远航，深入海心，在离两边大陆都有1500海里的那种场景，你会有什么感受？大海对水手来说，是善意的还是恶意的？&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;徐京坤：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;我其实没有什么特别文艺的感受。对于我这条赛船来说，在大洋中心的时候反倒不害怕，它的安全性能特别好，设计出来就是为了对抗风暴的，只要你自己不操作错误，非常安全。反倒是靠近沿岸，渔网啊往来船只等各种东西都会对这条船构成威胁。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;大海它没有善意，也没有恶意，它无意伤害你，它就按照自然法则客观存在着。在海上人自然会平静下来，不会那么愤世嫉俗。我说实话，我觉得我更怕人。有时候专心忙航海的事情不看新闻，心很定，一关注社会新闻，感觉自己无所适从。西方社会制定的规则是针对东方的，东方又要针对西方做些制衡，对吧？好多事情都没有一个客观裁定的规则，混成一团，超级复杂。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/sHh7XjhhF6fTr6VquWLzIvx8bI30sFUYjc6vvFgX.jpg&quot;

&lt;p>;生活上也做一些调整。有一段时间我们都住在船上，方便工作，老外看我们也是很吃惊，早晨、晚上这俩中国人都在干活。前段时间刚租了一个房子，生活稍微正常一点。有一段时间，压力真的大到我看到那条船都已经厌恶了，失去乐趣了，我心里知道这肯定不行的。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;面对接下来旺代环球那种魔鬼航程，你如果没有真诚的热爱，没有真诚的信念，你的初心如果丢失的话，你是不可能坚持下来的。&lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;徐京坤：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;确实我有这个问题。每次完成一个赛事目标，停下来以后，我确实有时候不知道怎么应对生活里边的事。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我的天赋是我能够去管理好一个单一的事情，我把这条船打造到极致，做得非常好，全力以赴，不偷懒不耍滑，这是我的一个性格。但一回到生活当中，需要应对一些规则，有时候我就觉得不公平，就会让我很不舒服，我不喜欢被压抑，但有时候你又无力反抗，包括对于人事会觉得很头疼，对人事我非常不敏感。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;比如你看我那么多好朋友和大哥，其实每次回来我经常会忽略了给他们带点东西或者是多一些关心回馈什么的。在这方面我是一个弱智，经常到了人家门口了才想起来今天什么也没有带，你又不是说不懂这种人情世故，你也一把年纪了你又懂，但是反应过来的时候总是晚了，生活中就总是不那么灵光。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方人物周刊：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;咖啡路你和英国传奇船长迈克·戈丁搭档，1200海里的资格航程，比去年朗姆路资格赛快了17个小时。迈克有过三次旺代参赛经验，十夺咖啡路亚军，你驾驭赛船也越来越娴熟，除了参赛完赛是否对名次还有更高预想？&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;徐京坤：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;从我自己还有赛船的能力上，的确是可以冲击更快的速度的，我的船到现在还只释放了百分之七十的性能，没有往极限去狠跑。但是我们的策略还是安全完赛，拿到积分。说实话，我手上连大修一次的钱都没有，没有任性跑的资本。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这一点我跟迈克·戈丁船长也有过明确沟通，他非常理解，他也经历过这种资金有限的困难时期。策略非常明确，但执行到位不犯错仍然会是一个挑战，我天天告诫自己千万别激进，别贪快！一定要慢，一定要慎重！但是在海上很多时候都是瞬间决断，那一瞬间很难说自己认为正确的决定是真正明智的。希望我和搭档能够配合好，在具体情况中能够做好平衡。&lt;/p>;

The attack left one teacher dead and three others seriously injured. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Just one day later, France’s Louvre Museum, Palace of Versailles, Lyon Train Station and other landmark buildings issued “emergency evacuation orders” due to security threats. Some Louvre museum visitors posted on social media that loud sirens were heard during the evacuation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Just last month, Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula issued a &quot;terrorist attack warning&quot; to France and Sweden through an internal publication. French Interior Minister Gérald Darmanin said in an exclusive interview with L&#39;Ouest-France that the authorities would respond as seriously as ever because &quot;the risk of terrorism remains high.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The fear of the &quot;11.13 Paris terrorist attacks&quot; many years ago came to mind. Why is France always targeted by terrorists? &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;The risk of terrorist attacks has revived&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Eight years ago, after the &quot;11.13 Paris terrorist attacks&quot;, people took to the streets and stood at the site of the attack. Place condolence candles and flowers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the evening of November 17, 2015, at the memorial site near the Rue des Fountains de la King in Paris, photographer Benjamin Filarski spotted a sad policeman leaning on the shoulders of his colleagues among the mourning crowd. Crying. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Benjamin seized the opportunity and pressed the shutter, freezing the heartbreaking scene. He posted the photo on social media, titled &quot;Crying Police.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Eight years later, this scene of police crying, which represented the painful memory of France, appeared in a new round of &quot;terrorist attack notices&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to a report by French Commercial FMTV (BFMTV) on September 14, Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) issued a &quot;terrorist threat&quot; to France and Sweden in its latest publication &quot;Voice of Combat&quot; . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In a propaganda poster published by Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), a masked man is holding a long gun and looking down from a high position. Under cold eyes, two French policemen hugged each other and cried. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is understood that the article of the promotional material was disseminated through a variety of Internet platforms. The article also suggested that after a series of scripture-burning incidents, Sweden &quot;led the EU countries in combating Islam and Muslim countries.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula is a radical Islamist organization mainly active in Yemen and Saudi Arabia. After the terrorist attack on Charlie Hebdo in Paris in January 2015, the organization &quot;claimed responsibility.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;criminal record&quot; and naked provocation have aroused concern among the French authorities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“For a long time, we thought this would not happen again. However, Afghanistan, the Levant and Africa, etc. are funding it, which means the threat could happen.” 9, 2023 On March 20, French Interior Minister Darmanin warned in an interview that the risk of terrorist attacks in the country may resurface. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Darmanin pointed out that the current main danger still comes from radical elements in France. These individuals, often radicalized progressively on the Internet, are deeply isolated, receptive to jihadist propaganda and respond to calls for hate. They use very limited means to carry out their actions due to reasons such as religious radicalization, imitation or mental fragility. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, al-Qaeda and Islamic State affiliates have reestablished themselves in some areas. In the Sahel, especially in the Levant and Afghanistan, drug networks are being re-established and have the potential to finance terrorism. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“With money, these groups can train jihadists on the spot, for example by infiltrating migrant flows. Like some of the perpetrators of the November 13, 2015 attacks. They can also do it remotely. Train other people,” Darmanin said. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Burqa ban&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Tug-of-war&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;According to French BFMTV report on September 15, the terrorist organization called for &quot;letting Muslim children &quot;Being alone&quot; and &quot;growing up under the protection of parents&quot;. This text, coupled with the threat against &quot;a ministry in Paris,&quot; suggests that Al Qaeda was referring to the recent &quot;Abaya ban&quot; in France. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;It&#39;s hard not to link it to the recent ban on wearing abaya in French schools, although this was not mentioned at all,&quot; the report said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Abaya is a loose robe that covers the curves of a woman&#39;s body. In French schools, it is common to see female Muslim students wearing abaya to school. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the end of August 2023, the French government banned students from wearing such clothing with obvious religious symbols on the grounds of the principle of separation of church and state. According to instructions from the education department, when the school term begins in September, students wearing abaya will not be allowed to enter the classroom. After that, the school will &quot;explain the meaning of the ban&quot; to them. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;French President Macron emphasized on this issue that the government &quot;will never give in&quot; on this issue related to the principle of secularism. He said, &quot;We know that there will be violations... Some may just be out of negligence, but a lot of them want to challenge republican values. We must not compromise.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although the French government has banned the ban Despite the tough stance, some Muslim students still come to school wearing burqas. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to statistics from the French Ministry of Education, when school started on September 4, 298 students across the country were wearing burqas to school, and only 67 of them refused to take off their burqas. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On September 7, local time, a girl from Clermont-Ferrand High School in France was banned from entering the school because she insisted on wearing a burqa to school. Subsequently, the girl&#39;s father issued a &quot;throat-cutting&quot; death threat to the principal. After the principal called the police, the parent was detained by the police that night. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to student groups, there are also many Muslim supporters who oppose the &quot;burqa ban&quot; in various ways. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the French government issued a ban, three institutions, including the Paris-South Education Association, appealed. They asked for the ban to be suspended, saying that the ban violated &quot;fundamental freedoms.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On September 19, 2023, more than a dozen Muslim women gathered outside the French Embassy in Austria to express solidarity with French Muslim women over the abaya ban. In a video of the protest that circulated online, a woman wearing an orange robe and headscarf could be seen holding up a protest sign that read &quot;Abaya, our identity, our rights.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“France’s Muslim policy is actually part of its basic requirements for citizens of all ethnic groups.” Niu Song, a researcher at the Institute of Middle East Studies at Shanghai International Studies University, told Southern Weekend reporters that as far as religious clothing is concerned, it involves It’s not just the headscarf issue, clothing or symbols related to other religions, including Christianity, are also restricted. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;In other words, France&#39;s restrictions on religious clothing and symbols in the public sphere are not targeted at a specific religion, but the struggles of religious believers have always been accompanied by the policy implementation process. Even within French society, There are also different views on the understanding and implementation of the principles of republican assimilation and separation of church and state. In short, the fierce confrontations over headscarves and abaya clothing have not only torn French society apart, but are bound to anger conservative Muslim groups,&quot; Neuzon said. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After many days of debate, the French Supreme Court ruled on September 25 that the government’s ban on Muslim robes is “legal”. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Why &lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;always &lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;France? &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;From 2015 to 2016, the Bataclan concert hall shooting in France and the Charlie Hebdo attack occurred one after another, and violent terrorist attacks intensified. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the &quot;Nice Coast Terrorist Attack&quot; that killed at least 84 people on July 14, 2016, the British security think tank &quot;Centre for Geopolitics and Security Realism&quot; (CGSRS) published a report titled The report &quot;Why It&#39;s Always France&quot; attempts to analyze the internal logic behind the high incidence of terrorist attacks in France. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;While other European countries have also experienced terrorism, &quot;France is showing a clear pattern&quot; and is &quot;particularly affected,&quot; the report said. At the same time, although the attackers claimed &quot;loyalty to extremist organizations,&quot; most of them were young French citizens and acted in small groups. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Why is France such a prominent target of homegrown Islamic terrorism? The report offers several explanations for this. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The first is foreign policy. The report said France has a long history of meddling in the Muslim world, particularly in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. Islamists therefore often regard France as a &quot;legitimate target&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Secondly, the composition of France’s population increases the possibility of Islamic terrorist attacks. For example, 7%-9% of the population is Muslim, which is much higher than other large European countries such as Germany or the United Kingdom. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, immigrants from the Middle East and North Africa lack mobility opportunities and have lived in poverty for a long time, which has brought &quot;distrust and hatred&quot; towards French native people and institutions. Finally, France has a long tradition of secularism, and many citizens have a very negative view of any form of religion. This has left some Muslim groups feeling that their religious freedom is under attack. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many Chinese international relations scholars also explained to Southern Weekend reporters why France is &quot;targeted&quot; by extremist organizations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Nutson believes that within the Western camp, France has a relatively &quot;strict&quot; attitude towards diverse ethnic groups and faith groups, emphasizing ethnic equality and defending the principle of secularization, and does not allow religious elements to be excessively displayed in the public sphere. Therefore, contradictions and conflicts surrounding the issue of headscarves and abaya clothing will appear periodically. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, there are structural contradictions between immigrants, refugees and European society, which include not only significant gaps in economic strength, but also differences in civilizational backgrounds. Countries such as Germany and Italy have relatively mild attitudes and policies towards Muslim immigrants, while France, due to its strict secularization policy, is more likely to intensify already accumulated conflicts on issues such as religious clothing, and it is difficult to maneuver around the issue due to its religious nature. room. France has naturally become the &quot;priority&quot; option for terrorist organizations to carry out attacks in Europe. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Yiwei, director of the Institute of International Affairs at Renmin University of China, told Southern Weekend reporters that France is the birthplace of modern European civilization. The concepts of liberty, equality, and fraternity of the French Revolution influenced the entire Europe. However, the proliferation of freedom also brings offense to other civilizations, which will cause dissatisfaction among conservatives. At the same time, France has a large Muslim population, and actions against the external Muslim world will also cause internal backlash. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As predicted in the &quot;Why Always France&quot; report, &quot;France may face more terrorist attacks in the future due to the complexity and depth of the problem.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;“&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;This&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;is not new&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Except for the law Abroad, Sweden was also targeted in this &quot;terrorist attack notice&quot;. This is related to the controversy over the burning of scriptures by radicals in Sweden for several months. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since June 2023, incidents of burning and desecrating Islamic religious texts have occurred in many places in Sweden. The main participants are Iraqi refugees Salwan Momika and Salwan Najim. (Salwan Najem). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The two have publicly opposed the Islamic religious classic &quot;Quran&quot; on many occasions and held demonstrations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, before this &quot;terrorist attack notice&quot;, Sweden had been &quot;named&quot; and intimidated by other extremist organizations due to the &quot;Scripture Burning&quot; incident. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In August 2023, the Al Qaeda media platform &quot;As-Sahab Media Foundation&quot; (The As-Sahab Media Foundation) called in an announcement titled &quot;The Obligation to Attack Aggressive Nations&quot; to Denmark and Sweden have retaliated against the burnings of scriptures that have occurred over the past few months. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On August 13, the British Foreign Office issued a travel warning, stating that an attack was likely to occur in Sweden, and that its security authorities had foiled many attack attempts. The Chinese Embassy in Sweden also reminded that Chinese citizens should pay attention to changes in the current security situation in Sweden, increase security awareness, maintain a high degree of vigilance, and strengthen security precautions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On August 17, Sweden raised the country&#39;s terrorism threat level from Level 3 to Level 4 &quot;high threat status&quot; for the first time since 2016. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Swedish authorities stated that this decision was based on a &quot;comprehensive, long-term and strategic judgment&quot; based on the deteriorating security situation in Sweden. Since then, many Swedish departments have strengthened security measures in borders, airports, public transportation and other fields. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Regarding the &quot;terrorist threats&quot; encountered by Sweden, Hans Brun, a Swedish terrorism researcher at King&#39;s College in the United Kingdom, believes that these threats are &quot;not new&quot; and not that important. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He told Sweden&#39;s TT news agency, &quot;You can think of it as a call to action for individuals. If they had organized it themselves, they would not have announced it in advance like this. You should also remember that Al Qaeda is now greatly weakened.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Brun said that Al Qaeda&#39;s statement will not affect the overall security situation. The biggest impact may be on Danish and Swedish diplomats working in the Middle East, who may need Take extra precautions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Brunn’s “prophecy” is not groundless. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In July 2023, after radicals burned scriptures outside a mosque in the Swedish capital Stockholm, Iraqi protesters stormed the Swedish Embassy in Iraq, expelled the ambassador and burned the embassy. Iraqi Prime Minister Sudani even expelled the Swedish ambassador and suspended the work permit of Swedish telecommunications company Ericsson. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As of now, the Swedish government is seeking legal means to limit the intensification of scripture burning incidents in recent days in order to ease tensions with Islamic countries. However, supporters have argued that this could violate the country&#39;s constitution. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Will they take action?&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;As of September 8, 2023 Since the start of the Rugby World Cup, France has been hosting large-scale events, including the visit of King Charles III and the visit of the Pope, and these events will continue until the 2024 Paris Olympics. As French Interior Minister Darmanin lamented in an interview, &quot;The risk of terrorism is very high, and major incidents are coming one after another.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Darmanin said that in order to provide security for the Olympics, France has added 14,000 police and gendarmerie and is cooperating with multiple departments to deal with different risks. &quot;We&#39;ve been working on this for two years,&quot; Darmanin said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;With the announcement of terrorist attack warnings, many people are worried about whether extremist organizations will take action. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Alain Rodier, deputy director of the French Intelligence Research Center, said in an interview with BFMTV that Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula took action two years after threatening &quot;Charlie Hebdo&quot;. &quot;This shows that Al Qaeda has the ability to wait.&quot; &quot;When they make threats, they often take action.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On September 28, Southern Weekend reporters contacted Alan Rodier via email, and he revealed many details about the organization. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Alain Rodier said that in 2013, Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula announced 11 &quot;wanted persons&quot; through the online publication &quot;Inspire&quot;, including &quot;Charlie Hebdo&quot; cartoonist Stefan Stéphan Charbonnier. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Two years later, two self-proclaimed terrorists from Al Qaeda, brothers Cherif Kouachi and Saïd Kouachi, attacked Charlie Hebdo, resulting in At least 12 people, including the editor-in-chief of the weekly, were killed and many others were injured. One of the perpetrators, Said, received military-style training in Yemen in 2011. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Alain Rodier believes that since the 2015 attacks, the jihadist movement launched by extremist organizations no longer seems to target Western countries directly, but &quot;recruits through advertisements.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“These organizations do not appear to have sufficient means to send activists to Europe to carry out terrorist acts. We must ensure that their speeches are not exploited by endogenous terrorists,” Alain-Rodier said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Niu Song, from the Institute of Middle East Studies at Shanghai International Studies University, believes that under the global coordinated anti-terrorism offensive, Al Qaeda&#39;s influence is not as strong as before, but it still has the motivation and ability to carry out violent terrorist attacks. Therefore, Al Qaeda’s threat to launch attacks on France and Sweden should not be taken lightly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Nutson said that in fact, the international community, including France and Switzerland, has always been highly concerned about and should be vigilant about the current trends and capabilities of al-Qaeda, and will not remain indifferent to its verbal threats. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are also people who are skeptical about this terrorist attack warning. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wasim Nasr, a senior researcher at the Soufan Center in France, called on the public to remain rational in an interview with the French &quot;Le Point&quot; magazine. &quot;There is no moment of panic yet. arrival&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He believes that the magazine has a total of 17 pages, focusing on Yemen, and the threats to Sweden and France only appear on page 14. &quot;The threat is certainly there and we must take it seriously, but there is currently no reason to be more alarmed,&quot; Nasr said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(Southern Weekend intern Li Jinao also contributed to this article)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 16 Oct 2023 14:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[巴赫：国际奥委会正考虑创办奥林匹克电子竞技运动会]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258672]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-16 14:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Whether e-sports can be included in the Olympics, there may be a new answer soon. International Olympic Committee President Bach revealed here on the evening of the 14th that the International Olympic Committee is considering creating an Olympic Games that belongs to e-sports. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Bach made the above remarks while delivering a speech at the opening ceremony of the 141st Plenary Session of the International Olympic Committee held that night. He said: &quot;I have asked the new International Olympic Committee e-sports committee to study the creation of Olympic e-sports games.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;a>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms /medias/image/23/10/15/c802d6c41ee832ef334118874cf8eb40.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1000&quot; height=&quot;564&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com /cms/medias/image/23/10/15/c802d6c41ee832ef334118874cf8eb40.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;254123&quot;>;&lt;/a>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to statistics, about 3 billion people around the world play video games. More than 500 million people are particularly interested in e-sports, including virtual sports and simulated sports, and most of them are young people under the age of 34. Bach said that the International Olympic Committee attaches great importance to this, so since 2018, the International Olympic Committee has been involved in the development of e-sports projects in an all-round way. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We have chosen a way that allows us to be active in esports while remaining true to the values ​​that we have lived by for more than a century. In esports, the values ​​have always been A red line we will not cross. Our clear stance has earned us growing respect from the esports community. A leading publisher redesigned one of their popular games to align with Olympic values ​​– so players Just shoot the target, not the person.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2021, the International Olympic Committee will host the Olympic Virtual Series. This is the International Olympic Committee’s first pilot project in the field of e-sports. Based on the successful experience of the Olympic Virtual Series, the International Olympic Committee held the first Olympic Esports Week this year, and the results were very popular - including the qualifiers, the esports series attracted more than 500,000 participants, and the competition Over 6 million live views across all channels. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Bach said: &quot;It&#39;s a promising start, but it&#39;s just the beginning. As in any sport, even after a promising start, the real game is still ahead. &quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Bach also talked about artificial intelligence in his speech that night, saying: &quot;Our continued success depends on how we embrace the accelerating development of digital technologies, especially artificial intelligence. This makes our &quot; &quot;Olympic Agenda 2020&quot; is even more urgent - &#39;Either change or be changed&#39;.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Bach emphasized that the International Olympic Committee must take the initiative, &quot;We must conduct a comprehensive analysis of the opportunities and risks of artificial intelligence , and then take action immediately. I&#39;m happy to tell you that this work is already underway. If things go well, you may see some preliminary results in Paris (Olympic Games).&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The 141st Plenary Session of the International Olympic Committee will last until the 17th. The main agenda of this plenary session includes voting on amendments to the Olympic Charter and the project setting of the 2028 Los Angeles Olympic Games, and the election of several new International Olympic Committee members. In addition, the plenary session will evaluate the mid-term implementation of the Olympic 2020+5 Agenda and hear the plans for the 2024 Paris Olympics, the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics, the 2032 Brisbane Olympics, and the 2026 Milan-Cortina d’Ampezzo Winter Games.

The employees of the maintenance shop in the service area threatened to stop the maintenance technicians hired from outside to repair the car. Is this &quot;reasonable and legal&quot;? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to Jimu News, a truck transporting fruit broke down and failed to start while resting in the Jiangxi Fengcheng service area of ​​the Shanghai-Kunming Expressway. After the auto repair shop in the service area said it could not repair the vehicle, the driver himself invited a technician from a nearby designated repair shop of the truck manufacturer to come to the service area to prepare for repairs. Unexpectedly, he was blocked and intimidated by the staff of the repair shop in the service area. The maintenance technician who was invited had no choice but to leave. The truck driver contacted several local repair shops, but they did not dare to arrange for personnel to go to the service area to repair the vehicle. There was no choice but for the driver to drag the car off the highway to repair it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is not uncommon for car repairs to conflict with repair shops in expressway service areas. More than a month ago, a similar incident occurred in the Jiqing service area in Hunan. A truck driver was stopped by repairmen in the service area when he was inspecting his truck. After being told that the driver made the repairs himself, he uttered wild words. On social networks, similar complaints involving car repairs and tow truck conflicts on the highway are not the same. Some service area repair shop staff even use violence or threaten violence against drivers who repair their own cars. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the highway, can only repair shops in the service area repair cars? In an interview with the media, the person in charge of the Fengcheng service area said that the practices of the repair shop in the service area are &quot;reasonable and legal and have laws to follow.&quot; The law the person in charge refers to refers to the provisions of the Highway Law, Highway Safety Protection Regulations and other relevant regulations that &quot;prohibit the establishment of stalls within the scope of highways and highway land.&quot; This is obviously a misinterpretation. The so-called &quot;setting up stalls&quot; refers to setting up relatively fixed stalls for a long time and waiting for customers to come to your door. The purpose of prohibiting it is to avoid &quot;damaging, polluting the highway and affecting the smooth flow of the highway.&quot; After receiving the invitation from the customer, he temporarily went on the road to repair the car, precisely to repair the vehicle as soon as possible to avoid parking on the road for a long time and to ensure the smooth flow of the road. Regardless of the definition of &quot;setting up a stall&quot; or the legislative purpose of the regulations, it is completely legal for drivers to repair their cars by themselves or to invite repairmen to temporarily repair their cars on the road. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the conflict at the Jiqing service area in Hunan mentioned above, the repairmen in the service area claimed that the Provincial Department of Transportation had a document that stipulated that &quot;people below&quot; (referring to repair shops other than the expressway) cannot go to the expressway for repairs. car, but ultimately failed to produce relevant documents. Do the traffic management departments in some places really have such regulations? If such a document does exist, it should be made public and reviewed for legality. If the government department does not have such regulations, is this an internal regulation of the highway management department, or is the service area repair shop lying? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In vehicle maintenance services, drivers and car owners are consumers, and of course they have the right to freely choose repair service providers. Auto repair shops in service areas prevent drivers from repairing their cars by themselves or other repairmen, and force drivers to go to their repair shops to repair their cars. This is a &quot;forced transaction&quot; behavior that is expressly prohibited by the Consumer Rights Protection Act. The Criminal Law also stipulates that using violence or threats to forcefully buy or sell goods, force others to provide services or force others to receive services, if the circumstances are serious, constitutes the crime of forced transaction. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Why are obviously illegal behaviors so common? The root of the problem lies in the word &quot;profit&quot;. As the person in charge of the Fengcheng service area said, off-road vehicle maintenance personnel going to the service area to repair cars &quot;harms the interests of the service area repair shops.&quot; The interests of service area repair shops are actually the interests of service area and highway managers. Expressway service areas, as part of expressway service facilities, are constructed and operated by expressway managers. If a repair shop opens in a service area, it must pay space rent to the highway administrator. These rents are generally higher than those for sites outside highways, because this is not only site rent, but also implies a premium for &quot;exclusive operating rights.&quot; Precisely because highway managers also benefit from the &quot;exclusive operating rights&quot; of repair shops, they will naturally try their best to protect the interests of repair shops. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This &quot;exclusivity&quot; premium is very common in closed establishments. Food prices in airport terminals and highway service areas are generally much more expensive than in urban areas. Even canteens in primary and secondary schools can be auctioned for sky-high prices. This is all due to the monopoly benefits brought by the &quot;exclusive operating rights.&quot; More importantly, these premium benefits are not obtained through market competition, but rely on franchise rights granted by administrative power. For these infrastructure operators with administrative monopolies, the common practice in various countries is to strictly limit their profit margins to maintain a balance between attracting social investment and avoiding huge profits to maintain public welfare. To this end, they must be strictly supervised to prevent them from relying on their monopoly status to harm the public interest. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A few years ago, there was an incident in a highway service area in Guangdong where a driver repaired his own car and was threatened by a repair shop employee. Due to public opinion and the intervention of relevant departments, the auto repair shop in the service area was shut down for rectification. The same incident occurred in Fengcheng, Jiangxi this time. The public expects local market supervision and other departments to take timely action to investigate and deal with forced buying and selling, and forced transactions to safeguard the interests of consumers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 16 Oct 2023 12:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[身份证、退伍证、婚姻信息、家庭住址……当一个明星被“开盒”]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258670]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-16 11:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;On the evening of October 12, Chen Muchi, who plays the role of Prince Yin Jiao in the movie &quot;Fengshen Part 1&quot;, He posted a statement on Weibo, responding that he &quot;did have a marriage.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/15/a4e19d459cf53705edb203836a30d784.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height= &quot;413&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/15/a4e19d459cf53705edb203836a30d784.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;254121&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Why suddenly Admit that you have been married? It turned out that before Chen Muchi released his statement, a screenshot purporting to be his marriage registration information had been quickly circulated on the Internet. The screenshot contains very detailed information, including not only the registration certificate number, registration institution, registrar’s name and registration date, but also personal information such as the ID number and household registration location of both men and women. Some netizens even circulated an unmosaic version. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What the melon-eaters discussed with enthusiasm was nothing more than: getting married and divorced at a young age? There was no response to rumors about a relationship on the Internet before, so why did you come out to respond when it was revealed that you were married? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some netizens pointed out that Chen Muchi had to respond because he was &quot;opened&quot;. Because not only his marriage registration information is spread on the Internet, but also his ID card photo, veteran information and personal contact number. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/15/e216e7cb88a5f40d47751c7ce1ddfeef.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height= &quot;854&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/15/e216e7cb88a5f40d47751c7ce1ddfeef.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;254119&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What is &quot; Open the box”? &quot;Unboxing&quot; is not essentially different from &quot;human flesh&quot;. It is an act of publicly exposing the privacy of others on the Internet with the purpose of &quot;breaking the other party&#39;s hypocrisy&quot;. It is actually an act of cyber violence that infringes on personal privacy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First of all, celebrities, like ordinary people, have the right to marry and love freely, and they can choose to do so publicly or not. Although celebrities, as public figures, will be exposed to the public eye and accept comments from the outside world, can their personal privacy be exposed at will and involuntarily? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The problem of personal privacy leakage reflected in this incident is more serious than many people imagine. Nowadays, any ordinary person will receive sales calls from different banks, credit, and real estate companies every day, and the leakage of personal contact information has become a common occurrence. For celebrities, their ID numbers are almost an open secret. Taking airport pick-up and drop-off as an example, how do fans learn about a celebrity’s travel itinerary? Most of them have the ID numbers and itinerary information of celebrities, and this information usually comes from illegal &quot;scalpers&quot; selling it for a few yuan to dozens of yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/15/18a2b1484d42333596d077e3559bf7b8.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;617&quot; height= &quot;735&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/15/18a2b1484d42333596d077e3559bf7b8.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;254122&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src =&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/15/208f5fa16d95e7cd3c26e368dbbbbe9a.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;505&quot; height=&quot;404&quot; data-src=&quot;// images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/15/208f5fa16d95e7cd3c26e368dbbbbe9a.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;254118&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;With this information, they can not only grasp the star&#39;s schedule, They can also book air tickets and steal their mileage at will.

Was it the work of staff from the civil affairs system? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Coincidentally, on January 31, 2023, Hu Ge announced that he was getting married and had a daughter. However, because his wife was not a public figure, Hu Ge did not disclose her identity.

The act of spreading other people&#39;s privacy based on the mentality of taking advantage of others will not only cause secondary harm to the victim, but is actually illegal. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Article 1032, paragraph 1, of the Civil Code stipulates: &quot;Natural persons enjoy the right to privacy. No organization or individual may infringe on the privacy rights of others by means of spying, intrusion, disclosure, disclosure, etc.&quot; The right to privacy protects the privacy of natural persons. It can be seen from the word privacy itself that it has two characteristics: one is &quot;hidden&quot;, that is, it is not a public state. If it has been disclosed by a natural person or legally disclosed, it is not private; the second is &quot;private&quot;, That is, private matters have nothing to do with other people&#39;s rights and interests, public interests, etc. It is from these two aspects that Article 1032, Paragraph 2 of the Civil Code defines privacy as: &quot;A natural person&#39;s private life is peaceful and he does not want others to know about his private space, private activities, and private information.&quot;&lt; /p>; &lt;p>;Article 1033 of the Civil Code stipulates that, unless otherwise provided by law or with the explicit consent of the right holder, no organization or individual may commit the following acts:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;( 1) Intruding on the private life and peace of others through phone calls, text messages, instant messaging tools, emails, leaflets, etc.;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;(2) Entering, photographing, and peeping into other people&#39;s homes, hotel rooms, and other private spaces;&lt; /p>; &lt;p>;(3) Photographing, peeping, eavesdropping, and disclosing the private activities of others;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;(4) Photographing, peeping at the private parts of others’ bodies;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;(5) Process other people&#39;s private information;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;(6) Infringe on the privacy rights of others in other ways. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;No matter whether you love or hate a person, you should not use the &quot;open box&quot; method to make other people&#39;s legally protected privacy and personal information public, and you must never do anything illegal. Blind tolerance and helplessness will only encourage the voyeurs&#39; desire for control and arrogance, allowing them to hide in dark corners and continue to do whatever they want. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Whether you are a celebrity or an ordinary person, your right to privacy is protected by law. Legal experts also emphasized that when the legitimate rights and interests enjoyed are illegally infringed, one should immediately call the police and use legal weapons to protect one&#39;s own rights and interests. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 16 Oct 2023 11:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[中国足协换届选举产生新一届主席、副主席]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258674]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-16 10:13:44&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;span>;On October 16, the 12th Member Congress of the Chinese Football Association was held in Beijing to elect new members.
