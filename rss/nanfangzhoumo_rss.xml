He also stated in a reply: The real-name system at the front desk is aimed at It is a self-media account with 1 million fans, which will be reduced to 500,000 fans in the future. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In July 2023, the Central Cyberspace Administration of China issued the &quot;Notice on Strengthening the Management of &quot;Self-Media&quot;&quot;. Among the 13 articles, there is a requirement to &quot;standardize account operation behavior&quot;: website platforms should strictly implement the &quot;one-person According to the regulations on the number of account registrations for &quot;One Number, One Enterprise and Two Numbers&quot;, individuals or companies are strictly prohibited from manipulating the &quot;self-media&quot; account matrix to publish and disseminate illegal and harmful information. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The current network platform implements a &quot;backend real-name system&quot;, and the front-end real-name and pseudonym are decided by oneself. If you really commit a crime on the Internet, you cannot go unpunished. The police will find you very quickly. Because the phone number used for registration itself is a real-name one; the IP addresses of Internet users are recorded in the background. However, even if real names are used in the background, as long as the person does not actively expose his or her information, the anonymity of online accounts is still quite strong, and online moral constraints are far inferior to offline ones. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Therefore, for some people, if they want to maintain the quiet handsome man/demure lady personality that the large account has established, or if the large account exposes private information, they can just create another small account, go there Say something that the big one won&#39;t say. In this way, a person&#39;s personality can be divided into three: the offline one, a normal person in the eyes of colleagues and family members; the large one, an image with an ideal personality; the small one, another one, All kinds of darkness and nastiness appear. Seamless switching between ego, superego and id. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The bigger problem with anonymity is that some self-media, in order to create topics and traffic, have no bottom line at all, and use all kinds of opposition to mobilize, engage in &quot;team building&quot;, and brush up comments and hot searches. Using a small power to create a huge voice in an organized manner to create public opinion and influence the legislative and judicial process; the same party opposes dissent, and organized super-saturated attacks, harassment, and threats against individuals and institutions that disagree with their actions and values. This is It has become a public nuisance, constantly dissolving the consensus and values ​​on which society relies for survival, and greatly deteriorating the ecology of public spaces. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So, can these problems be solved by allowing self-media accounts with 1 million or even 500,000 fans to have real names at the front desk? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We might as well do a model analysis. There is a group of people, each of whom has a voting right. So which one is better, anonymous voting or real-name voting, so that everyone can express their true opinions and make the results more fair? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some people think it is better to vote anonymously: this way everyone can express their true opinions without pressure. But the disadvantages of anonymity are also obvious. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First, some people may be bribed or asked privately, because the final result is anonymous. Except for people who are colluding with each other, others have no way of knowing how they voted and no moral pressure can be exerted on them. , in this case, the vote he cast probably cannot be called &quot;expressing his true thoughts.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Secondly, even if some people have not been bribed or accepted private requests, their voting tendency may not be fair. For example, they may not want to let others go because they have personal grudges. Or maybe it&#39;s purely because of the &quot;Prisoner&#39;s Dilemma&quot;: No matter you vote for or against my favorite, I will always vote against it, at least without losing money. In this way, unanimously opposing it becomes an advantageous strategy. Having a significant number of people think this way can significantly skew the overall voting results. Although these voters &quot;expressed their true thoughts,&quot; they had nothing to do with fairness. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, it is not ruled out that there are some people who are pure in nature and will not be bribed or accept private requests under any circumstances. They will put aside their personal grudges during the voting process and do not bother to conduct sophisticated calculations of interests. There are some people who objectively judge candidates based on their own merits, but they are probably few. In addition, it does not rule out that the above two types of people will vote fairly under certain circumstances. If the candidate is too good/bad, they cannot resist their conscience by insisting on voting against/for voting. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some people also think that real-name voting is good and can effectively reduce the above two unfair situations of anonymous voting. Everyone&#39;s voting results will be seen by others, thus making it easier to vote for favors and vote for personal grudges. Exposing the behavior of calculated votes to the public will significantly constrain such behavior. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But real-name voting is not without problems. First, some weak-minded people are afraid of offending others and do not dare to truly express their wishes and cast a fair vote when voting with real names; second, voting with real names will make the differentiation of factions from vague to clear. After factions or cliques are formed, conflicts will become apparent and may intensify. These two points are also the main reasons for implementing anonymous voting: to allow everyone to vote without pressure, thereby limiting the intensity of conflicts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To sum up, whether to vote anonymously or with a real name ultimately depends on which values ​​the institutions involved prefer and which issues need to be urgently resolved. How to apply this model analysis to whether the real-name system at the front desk should be implemented and the scope of implementation? If we want to solve the two problems of organized public opinion creation and organized over-limit attacks and harassment of individuals and institutions, we should undoubtedly implement a real-name system at the front desk to expose these organized and dark behaviors of self-media to the public and accept them. The scorching heat of the moral sun. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, if only self-media accounts with 1 million or even 500,000 fans require front-end real names, it may not be enough to curb the organized and dark behavior of self-media. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First of all, there is the question of how far the front desk needs to be real-named. Is it the real person in charge or the editor of the operation? How to solve the problem of letting people without decision-making power to top the tank and deal with the real-name front desk? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Secondly, organized public opinion creation and organized over-limit attacks and nuisance have become highly evolved. The main account with hundreds of thousands or millions of fans will not be left alone at first, allowing some peripherals or fans to send malicious messages or mobilization messages through small accounts, and then instigate or patiently wait for some accounts with fewer fans to forward them, in addition to layer upon layer of forwarding. , the main account will then follow up and forward, thus minimizing the risk of the main account. This method of &quot;wearing multiple layers of cover&quot; is difficult to break the real-name system at the front desk of some self-media accounts with many fans, because small accounts and accounts with fewer fans can still do their own thing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 23 Oct 2023 20:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[专访广东省卫健委：基层诊疗“不仅要有大楼，还要有人才”]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259151]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-23 19:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/ image/23/10/23/9c64b58a94.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/ 23/9c64b58a94.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255009&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Lantang Town Central Health Center, Hospital, Zijin County, Heyuan City, Guangdong Province In the lobby of the outpatient clinic building, there are promotional roll-ups by the chief health expert.

Yao Jiaxin, secretary of the party committee of Liantan Health Center, who has been on the clinical front line and has just retired, thinks Liu Jianzu is the best candidate. &quot;We should consider those who are too old.

Until the chief health expert came to the Central Health Center of Langtang Town, Zijin County, Heyuan City, 7 kilometers away from his home (&lt;span style =&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Hereinafter referred to as Langtang Health Center&lt;/span>;). &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;The operation was very successful. Repeated treatment in other places like his may not have good results. Now we can treat him nearby and solve the problem.&quot; The chief surgeon, Chen Xiulun, a retired orthopedic expert from the Eighth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, told Southern Weekend reporters. Chen Xiulun is the chief orthopedic expert selected by Lantang Health Center. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Not only the real ability, but also the ability to speak Mandarin&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Being selected by 47 primary health centers is the first step, but if you want to get To get the appointment letter from the chief health expert, you still need to go through an interview. The &quot;Implementation Plan&quot; stipulates that during the interview, relevant experts from tertiary hospitals in prefecture-level cities should be invited to evaluate the applicant&#39;s professional and technical level, and at the same time, full consideration will be given to the actual situation of the local language, culture, eating habits, customs and other customs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Common technical issues include: how to perform an operation, what is the treatment plan for a certain disease, how to lead a surgical team for 1-2 years, etc. After the interview, the expert team will provide corresponding recommendations to the hospital. Different hospitals also have different priorities in selecting candidates. For example, Langtang Health Center and Liuhuang Health Center pay special attention to the laparoscopic and minimally invasive surgical capabilities of surgical experts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In addition to medical technology, language, family, etc. are also the focus. &quot;It is not required to speak the local language, but Mandarin must be passable.&quot; Compared with the first round of the grassroots plan for chief health experts, the new round of plans has attracted a lot more experts from outside Guangdong Province, and Guangdong has Cantonese, Chaoshan, Hakka, etc. A surgical expert interviewed by the Liuhuang Town Central Health Center of Fengshun County, Meizhou City (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 毷体, 毷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;hereinafter referred to as the Liuhuang Health Center&lt;/span>;), technical He was a good person, but his accent was too strong, and the Mandarin he spoke was difficult for even experts to understand, so he had to give up. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Doctors are very practical, and interviews cannot make deans completely reassured. &quot;Recruiting experts is not recruiting college students. At this age, those who can do it will be good, and those who can&#39;t will just be incompetent.&quot; Central Health Center of Yangcun Town, Boluo County, Huizhou City (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: italics, italics_GB2312, STKaiti; &quot;>;Hereinafter referred to as Yangcun Health Center&lt;/span>;) Director Wu Kaifeng told Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Before signing an employment agreement, many health centers hope to see the experts’ true abilities first. Chen Weigao, the director of Langtang Health Center, specially asked Hu Yuhui, the chief surgical expert, to perform two surgeries. He also asked professionals to discuss with him the key points of common third- and fourth-level surgeries such as ureteral stones. After checking at all levels, he felt comfortable hiring them. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Cracking the dilemma of &quot;the hospital has equipment, but no one knows how to use it&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align : left;&quot;>;When primary health centers hire surgical experts, they insist on endoscopic and minimally invasive techniques because &quot;the hospital has equipment, but no one knows how to use it.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Not many people can use the equipment introduced during the expansion of Langtang Health Center. &quot;In our case, doctors who can&#39;t use laparoscopy are ordinary doctors, and those who can use laparoscopy are high-end doctors.&quot; Dean Chen Weigao told Southern Weekend reporters bluntly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Hoping to hire experts in areas that are in short supply in hospitals is a common wish of many central health centers. For example, the Department of Orthopedics and Neurosurgery of Liantan Health Hospital previously had assistance experts from Yunfu and Zhaoqing, but there has always been a shortage of general surgery experts. Although it signed a contract with a tertiary hospital to provide assistance and solved the urgent need, two or three days of consultation per week still cannot meet the needs of the grassroots people. Needed, so this time a general surgery expert was specially hired. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Guangdong Provincial Health Commission told Southern Weekend reporters that after the hardware facilities are improved, if the relevant supporting systems still stick to the old rules and do not make timely adjustments, it is likely that &quot;only building, no talent&quot; and &quot;a good start but insufficient stamina&quot;. In July 2023, chief surgical expert Ding Shengwen performed more than a dozen laparoscopic surgeries as soon as he came to Yangcun Health Center. From now on, local villagers will no longer have to go out for laparoscopic surgeries. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;The lack of a complete teaching staff is our biggest confusion at the grassroots level.&quot; Yao Jiaxin, secretary of the party committee of Liantan Health Center, told Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;At the Air Force Hospital of the Southern Theater Command of his original unit, Lu Shuwen, the chief orthopedic specialist, performs operations as a team operation. He only needs to perform the most critical part of an operation. When he first came to Yangcun Health Center as the chief specialist, he personally performed every operation from disinfection to draping, teaching the management practices of large hospitals to the grassroots doctors in Yangcun Health Center. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The arrival of the chief expert can help grassroots hospitals continue to improve their standardization level. Wu Kaifeng, director of Yangcun Health Center, lamented that the chief expert demonstrated the management level of the higher-level hospital where he worked. During the period when the experts came to the health center, the appearance of the entire department has changed a lot. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In addition, under the advice of chief experts, grassroots hospitals also supplement relevant drugs according to diagnosis and treatment needs to better meet the needs of patients. Yan Xinzheng, chief physician of geriatrics, came to Liuhuang Health Center and found that some drugs were missing. With the support of the director, the hospital replenished more than 20 kinds of drugs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/23/f41522b8f2.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/23/f41522b8f2.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255005&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The Central Health Center of Liuhuang Town, Fengshun County, Meizhou City, Guangdong Province is one of the 47 central health centers upgraded and constructed in Guangdong Province.

How to retain people is a problem faced by many health centers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The salary that primary health centers can provide to chief experts is not high, but everyone is trying their best to work hard. For example, they provide delicious food and a clean and comfortable living environment. Some health centers are even more meticulous - they are exposed to the sun in summer, reserve a separate indoor parking lot for experts, and arrange dedicated personnel to help experts familiarize themselves with the information management system. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Preserve people first and save their stomachs first. There is no canteen in Liuhuang Health Center, so we specially hired chefs to cook for the experts, including local dishes and dishes from the experts’ hometowns. After get off work, colleagues in the hospital will also invite experts to their homes for dinner, so that they can feel the respect of the staff and the family atmosphere. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;For many chief experts, whether the dean is a &quot;doer&quot; is one of the important reasons for choosing to come to the hospital. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Wu Kaifeng, director of Yangcun Health Center, believes that to retain experts, you must first know what the other party wants. The wish of surgical experts is to continue their craftsmanship and pass on the technology. . Therefore, the hospital handed over the surgical team to chief surgical expert Ding Shengwen to lead him, making him feel that his work was meaningful and that leading a discipline would give him a sense of accomplishment. &quot;In order for experts to have cultural identification with the hospital, it is necessary to create a cultural atmosphere in which disciplines are well developed, employees are well developed, and patients are considered.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;According to Southern Weekend The reporter learned that many retired experts gave up their salaries of well over 200,000 yuan and came to some health centers in Guangdong to apply for chief experts. &lt;p>; Worried that &quot;as a surgeon, if I continue to be idle like this, it will be wasted&quot;, I saw the recruitment news in Guangdong and filled out the application form. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Zhang Fengyun, who previously worked in Sichuan, lamented that &quot;Hakka is more difficult than English.&quot; In order to overcome the language barrier, Liuhuang Health Center assigned a local doctor as an interpreter. , working with Zhang Fengyun on medical consultations and ward rounds, and learning knowledge while doing a good job of translating. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;An expert hired by Lantang Health Center who is capable of minimally invasive surgery, laparoscopy and management has to postpone his working hours at the hospital due to personal reasons. Chen Weigao For fear of something unexpected happening, I took turns calling experts with the vice president and the hospital office. It was not until I changed my practice to Langtang Health Center and finalized the time of joining that I finally felt relieved. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The service period of the &quot;Hundred Chief Health Experts Under Grassroots Plan&quot; is three years. The hospital can sign a one-year agreement with the experts or sign a one-time three-year agreement with the experts based on actual conditions. Each hospital has its own considerations. For example, Liuhuang Health Center chose a one-year contract to leave room for both parties and &quot;don&#39;t tie everyone up&quot;; while Langtang Health Center directly signed a three-year contract in order to retain experts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The Guangdong Provincial Health Commission told Southern Weekend reporters that in the new round of &quot;100 chief health experts working at the grassroots level&quot;, a total of 186 people submitted registration information.

When they feel unwell and go to see a doctor, they often miss the best time for treatment. &quot;The patient had severe stomach pain, and it looked like he was in an advanced stage. Others saw that the hospital couldn&#39;t cure this disease, and they would never come back to the hospital in the future.&quot; Ding Shengwen told Southern Weekend reporters that he often encounters surgeries for late-stage intestinal cancer, obstruction, and perforation. There are fewer diseases in the early and middle stages. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;This also indirectly affects patients&#39; trust in primary hospitals. Zhang Fengyun once met a patient who did not believe in the anesthesia capabilities of Liuhuang Health Center and asked to be transferred to Meizhou City Hospital for surgery. The same plan was ultimately adopted. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In Yao Jiaxin’s view, the biggest advantage of the Central Health Center is its service. He hopes that the doctors in his hospital will have a good service attitude, especially in a society of acquaintances such as villages and towns, where 300,000 people spread the word by word of mouth, and the social benefits of attentive service cannot be underestimated. Technology comes second. As long as the patient stays, the doctor can consult experts or invite experts to perform surgery. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;There are many patients in large hospitals, so the treatment time is naturally less. Yan Xinzheng found that the treatment time for a patient in his original unit was only about 3 minutes, but at Liuhuang Health Hospital Hospital, can spend 15-20 minutes on a patient. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Especially if the patient is an elderly person with underlying diseases, many historical problems must be solved in one visit, and many rural elderly people are not aware of their own diseases. I don’t know. I have poor health awareness. I need the doctor to ask more questions. Zhang Fengyun once asked a patient if he had high blood pressure. The patient said no, but when he tested it, his blood pressure was extremely high. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Currently, each central health center has a population of 300,000 to 500,000. “If people from the surrounding area can go directly to the central health center for medical treatment, they don’t have to go to Yunfu, In Huizhou, you can save two to three hundred on the fare.&quot; Chen Weigao said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;According to Chen Weigao&#39;s preliminary statistics, after the introduction of experts, the outpatient volume, hospitalization volume, and surgical volume of Langtang Health Center increased by more than 30%. The average outpatient volume of Liuhuang Health Center in July and August 2023 was 6,000, which was nearly 1,300 more than the average outpatient volume from January to June, and an increase of 50% compared to the same period in 2022. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/23/c130c1b752.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/23/c130c1b752.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255007&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Chief experts Yan Xinzheng and Liu Jiang hired by the Central Health Center of Liuhuang Town, Fengshun County, Meizhou City, Guangdong Province, led the hospital&#39;s young doctors to conduct ward rounds and inquire about the patients&#39; recovery status.

This is the cost of food.”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;The hospital still has You have never practiced orthopedics, will you be able to work smoothly here?&quot; When Chen Xiulun, the chief orthopedic specialist hired by Langtang Health Center, first came to the hospital, the director was still a little hesitant. &quot;Orthopedic patients account for more than 40% of surgical patients. Precisely because it has not been developed, the market is huge and the future is bright.&quot; Chen Xiulun is very confident. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The first orthopedic equipment was even brought by Chen Xiulun himself, and other equipment was purchased later. Facts have proved Chen Xiulun’s judgment. After the establishment of the Department of Orthopedics, there has never been a shortage of patients. Other doctors also referred patients with orthopedics-related diseases to Chen Xiulun. Patients who had been missed or transferred before stayed in the hospital, and the referral rate increased from the past. of 100% dropped to 30%-40%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;This is what the &quot;Hundred Chief Health Experts Go to the Grassroots Plan&quot; most hopes to see - to build a specialty specialty and develop more than one new business and new Technology, &quot;pass, help and lead&quot; to create a professional team. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Chen Jianping, a professor at Guangzhou Medical University, is one of the first batch of grassroots experts. After retirement, he built a rehabilitation department in Liantan Health Center as a &quot;second venture&quot;. When he first joined the job, the hospital lacked equipment and could only spend 300,000 yuan for Chen Jianping to buy consumables. He made simple rehabilitation consumables by himself. Today, the Rehabilitation Department of Liantan Health Center is able to carry out 58 items of 6 categories of appropriate traditional Chinese medicine rehabilitation techniques, and the annual number of rehabilitation treatment patients has increased from about 10,000 in 2017 to 40,000 in 2022. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;We most hope that the experts will leave their skills to us. This is the cost of eating.&quot; Compared with outpatient visits, Ye Bizhen, Secretary of Liuhuang Health Center He told Southern Weekend reporters that in the final analysis, the hospital still wants to obtain the expertise of experts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Statistical results from the Guangdong Provincial Health Commission show that after the first batch of plans, 65.2% of central health centers established services including gynecology and gynecology with the help of chief experts. Obstetrics, traditional Chinese medicine, pediatrics, general surgery, gastroenterology and other specialties. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Zeng Zhongbo, a cardiovascular medicine expert hired by Lantang Health Center, previously practiced at Huizhou First People&#39;s Hospital, which is only more than an hour&#39;s drive from Lantang Health Center. The hospital thought that his patient base was good, and many residents from the town made a special trip to Huizhou to see him. It is hoped that he can guide the management of hypertension and diabetes, bring new technologies and treatments, and add a special specialty on cardiovascular disease in the future. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Zhang Fengyun described his idea to Southern Weekend reporters: in the first three months, doctors will be familiar with breast surgery, and in the next three months, they can start simple breast surgery. Suturing, and after half a year of further training, we strive to gradually separate the breast department from surgery. Only with professionalism can patients trust me. &quot;Breast surgery costs less and does not require complex equipment, so it is very suitable as a new specialty.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Doctors are a profession that is always learning. Yan Xinzheng found that grassroots doctors usually accumulated experience in consultation and lacked systematic theoretical training. He planned to organize common diseases in rural areas, such as hypertension and diabetes, into several 30-minute mini-lessons to train young doctors. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ding Shengwen hopes to slowly transplant the work style of large hospitals to Yangcun Health Center. He requires doctors to come to the hospital half an hour early one day a week and brings training materials from the original unit to the doctors. Lecture, &quot;Young people are good at editing surgical videos and looking up information, but they need a little push to form a habit.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 23 Oct 2023 19:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[百位名医下基层]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259078]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-23 19:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>; Hundreds of retired famous doctors in Guangdong have worked at the grassroots level, and nearly half have senior professional titles.

However, most companies are shell companies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Southern Weekend reporters compiled industrial and commercial records and found that three of them are still in operation. The registered addresses of these three companies are all #15, Suntec City One, Temasek Avenue, Singapore. -02.

But I never got a penny and I don&#39;t have any shares.&quot; A 41-year-old Singaporean originally from Shanghai Wang Yuan told The Straits Times. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Some money laundering gangs will also &quot;tempt&quot; regular companies to &quot;act as shells&quot; to launder money on their behalf. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Yue Siqiu, a native of Sanming, Fujian, has been doing business in Singapore for 10 years. She has come into contact with money launderers in Singapore. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;The other party wants to hire a member of their team in my company, and then use my company to buy a house. They will pay for the house purchase and give me 10 % remuneration.&quot; Yue Siqiu told Southern Weekend reporters that the other party targeted her company just because the company&#39;s accounts were clean and the bank would not suspect it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;岳思秋拒绝了洗钱者，反而被骚扰了很久。 “由于报酬丰厚，乌节路的部分华人商家会答应这些人的要求。”她说。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;10名嫌疑人名下持有大量资产。截至10月3日，新加坡警方已对多达152处房地产发出禁止处置令。被禁止处置的房地产属于嫌疑人、他们的配偶或所属公司，包括7栋圣淘沙升涛湾的独栋洋房、79套公寓（其中19套仍在建造中）和19块商业用地。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;“可以说，挣钱的方式有多少种，洗钱的方式就有多少种。”严立新告诉南方周末记者，“比特币等加密货币、黄金珠宝贵金属、奢侈品、收藏品等因其体积小、价值高、利于携带或运输、方便变现等特点，常常成为洗钱工具。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;近年来，不少房地产人接触过出手阔绰的“土豪”。新加坡房产经纪人田鑫向南方周末记者证实，他曾给新加坡福建人销售过高档公寓、独栋住宅。 “一些闽南口音的富豪，一下子能在我手里买两三套房子”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;只需要有一支会计师、律师组成的团队，做好账面工作，用房产洗钱的行为就可以瞒天过海。 “如果遇到银行询问资金来源，只要假账做得完美，就可以骗过。”一名房地产经纪人告诉新加坡《联合早报》。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;新加坡警方在嫌疑人住宅内缴获的奢侈品中，不乏豪车、腕表、名画和潮玩积木熊。 &lt;/p>;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;42岁的王水明是洗钱案中总资产较高的嫌疑人。他被指控伪造文件、持有非法放贷赃款等罪名，他持有土耳其、中国和瓦努阿图三国护照。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;新加坡法庭揭露，王水明在新加坡资产超过两亿新元，而他在其他国家的资产约3550万新元，其中柬埔寨资产高达2453万新元。王水明拥有11套新加坡公寓，其中十套位于背山向海的康宁河湾（Canninghill Piers），另一套是乌节路汤林生路的柏皓（Park Nova）公寓。 &lt;/p>;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;拿到身份期间，他们大多数时间在新加坡生活。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;“嫌疑人陆续成为柬埔寨公民，同一时间段还有其他中国人一起入籍，这些人多半是柬埔寨网赌公司的&#39;幕后首脑&#39;。”非营利组织网络诈骗监察网认为。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;南方周末记者询问多位生活在柬埔寨的中国人，不少人能认出苏宝林、苏海金，还有人与王水明“打过交道”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;“王水明算是柬埔寨网络赌博圈子里比较出名的福建人，九成以上在柬埔寨的中国人都认识他。”居住在柬埔寨的吕泽源告诉南方周末记者，并称王水明算个“人物”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;十年前，王水明依靠菲律宾的赌博网站起家，算是第一批在菲律宾开设线上博彩的福建人之一。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;巅峰时期，王水明手下的雇员达到1万人。在菲律宾积攒资金后，王水明又前往柬埔寨拓展网络赌博业务。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;柬埔寨华文媒体人林啸告诉南方周末记者，王水明入局网赌圈早。他们团队研发的资金盘“大发系统”被柬埔寨、缅甸、迪拜等地的网络赌博公司使用。这个系统“相对公平，不会轻易&#39;杀猪&#39;”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;一般情况下，网赌公司将参与线上赌客视为“猪”，当赌客大额充值时，公司后台就会锁住赌客的账号资金，与其切断联系，实现“杀猪”目的。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;南方周末记者查询柬埔寨、新加坡的工商信息发现，王水明是柬埔寨大明信息技术服务（Daming IT Services）公司的董事长，同时还是新加坡卓驰科技公司（Zhuo Chi Technology）的董事兼股东。上述公司均对外宣称“主营软件开发”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;王水明也是柬埔寨SCWD Construction公司的八名董事之一，该公司于2016年注册，公司字母所写与董事的姓氏相对应：苏、陈、王、邓。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;本次洗钱案另一名嫌疑人王德海也是SCWD Construction的八名董事之一。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;8月15日，王德海在乌节路巴德申山（Paterson Hill）一带公寓被捕，被控洗钱。新加坡警方在他的公寓搜出了超过220万新元现金、35块名表、51件首饰和数款名牌包。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;吕泽源在柬埔寨生活了近十年，他告诉南方周末记者，网络诈骗生意做大后，幕后大佬在菲律宾、马来西亚、泰国都会设立公司，一些“大佬”甚至会有私人专机。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;“这些人最后都偏向于去新加坡换一种生活。”吕泽源说。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;但生活在新加坡的网赌老板，不会停止在东南亚的网络诈骗生意。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;“这些网赌公司老板会远程管理公司事务，可能一年飞两三次柬埔寨，只处理大事，小事交给园区总经理。”林啸告诉南方周末记者。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“他们几乎整村人都在新加坡”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;新加坡的福建帮也随着洗钱案曝光。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;“新加坡的福建帮少则几十人，多则上百，他们当中按姓氏划分帮派，苏、王、胡、陈是几大主要帮派。”一名匿名的房地产经纪人告诉新加坡《联合早报》。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;苏海金和另一名嫌疑人王德海被认为是苏姓和王姓两个帮派的老大。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;新加坡福建帮一向出手阔绰。 “他们平常生活高调，开兰博基尼、法拉利等，到高档夜店消费时，陪同的都是中国籍女郎。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;福建帮重地缘、宗族关系，偏好小圈子文化。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;林啸的一个朋友与王水明同村，“他们算是小圈子文化，他帮王水明代理业务（做诈骗）。他们自己会做一个盘出来，村里人自己玩。”林啸告诉南方周末记者。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;而在2023年9月底，苏海金的辩护律师郑惠龙在法庭上表示，苏海金的四个孩子、他的父母、岳父岳母，甚至数名兄弟姐妹和亲属都在新加坡。 “他们几乎整村人都在新加坡”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;“福建帮的人喜欢找优秀年轻男性当说客，约本地华人见面、洽谈合作。”新加坡华人刘亚南告诉南方周末记者，他被说客邀约过几次，“但我没有答应”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;对于这起洗钱案，新加坡政府采取“零容忍”态度。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;9月中旬，新加坡内政和法律部长尚穆根接受新加坡《联合早报》采访时表示，任何人在新加坡做任何违法的事，或是在海外做非法勾当，再试图在新加坡洗钱，他们都会采取行动。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;2023年9月29日，王水明第三次过堂时，新加坡法官以“可能潜逃”“与其他嫌疑人串供”为由拒绝了他的保释申请。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;王水明等多名洗钱案嫌疑人在中国还背有案底，是国内的在逃人员。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;2022年5月，山东省淄博市博山区公安局破获一起“恒博包网赌博案”，抓获开设赌博网站、非法盈利的犯罪嫌疑人131名，追缴涉案资金一千余万元人民币。王水明是博山区公安局记录下的头号通缉人物。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;上述案件仍有9名涉案人员非法滞留国外，除了王水明外，其余八人均为福建安溪县人，多数为王姓。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;福建帮王姓头目王德海在2018年因涉嫌网络赌博案，被湖南省桂阳县公安B级通缉。同一时间被通缉的还有本次洗钱案的苏剑锋、苏文强。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;新加坡法庭调查发现，王德海在2012年从菲律宾参与赌博公司，从客服、推广，逐步将生意做大。目前，王德海以前就职过的赌博网站仍在运营。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/23/5177e81064.jpg&quot;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;目前，新加坡警方暂未发现王宝森与其他九名嫌疑人的商业联系。不过，王宝森的名字早已与东南亚诈骗团伙绑定。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;南方周末记者查阅判决文书网发现，早在2013年，王宝森便加入了福建安溪人王斌刚成立的菲律宾“鸿利国际”网赌网站，负责财务工作。 2014年网站团队迁入柬埔寨边境城市巴域（越南称木排），随后王宝森逐渐负责鸿利国际网站的全面管理工作，底薪为1万元人民币，另有奖金提成。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;该网站涉赌资金高达9.8亿元人民币。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;除了被指控的10名嫌疑人，目前还有多人正协助新加坡警方调查，包括企业服务提供商、房地产经纪和金融机构等。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;2023年8月28日，新加坡律政部向宝石和贵金属经销商发出的一份34人审查名单中，王宝森的妻子何惠芳、“鸿利国际”网站创始人王斌刚赫然在列。该审查名单旨在提醒宝石经销商及时通报可疑交易。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;案件不断发酵，9月初新加坡法庭宣誓书显示，王宝森一位表兄弟的1亿资金被冻结，此人已逃出新加坡。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;为了在他国生活，嫌疑人多持有多国护照。新加坡法庭10月18日揭露，唯一一名女性嫌疑人林宝英曾分别支付13万美元和16万美元，购买了多米尼克和柬埔寨的护照。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;“小国家护照可以通过移民中介买到，并不难获得。”新加坡DMC咨询公司董事王俭告诉南方周末记者，洗钱案曝光后，新加坡就推出了一个政策，凡是拿着小国护照的中国人很难在银行开户、开设公司。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;“除非这些人可以出具放弃原籍证明。”王俭说。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;截至发稿日，10名嫌疑人仍在寻求法院保释。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;新加坡法律规定，犯有洗钱罪的人可被判处最高10年监禁、最高50万新元的罚款，或两者并罚。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;尚穆根坦言，10名洗钱案被告一旦治罪，将在新加坡服刑，服完刑期后遣送回他所持护照的国家，或被送回跟新加坡有引渡协议的国家。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;而中国与新加坡没有引渡协议。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;（应受访者要求，文中王源、刘亚南、林啸、吕泽源、田鑫、岳思秋为化名）&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;获取更多RSS：&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot;

&lt;p>;2008年起，国内移动通信领域形成了中国移动、中国联通、中国电信的“三足鼎立”格局，由国有资本运营。 2012年，工信部发布《关于鼓励和引导民间资本进一步进入电信业的实施意见》，提出激励民间资本进入电信行业八个领域。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;其中，开放移动通信转售业务被认为是标志性事件，并于2013年正式启动试点，虚拟运营商应运而生。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;过去十余年，进入电信行业的民资运转如何？ &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;虚拟运营商之一分享通信集团董事长蒋志祥对南方周末记者描述，以虚拟运营商为代表的民间资本出现后，成为电信行业的一条“鲇鱼”，一定程度上推动了基础电信运营商的变革。 “最明显是把漫游费和长途费打掉了，这是看得见、摸得着的价值。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“与发达国家相比，中国虚拟运营商起步较晚，错过了上世纪90年代至本世纪前10年的市场上升期。”亦有多位资深电信观察人士难言乐观，“移动通信市场已接近饱和，留给后来者的机会并不多。基础电信运营商已经几乎把所有营销手段用尽了，移动通信市场最后变成一个打价格战的市场。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;随着几次改革措施的出台，电信行业壁垒正逐渐削弱，然而在民间资本面前，仍是一条充满探索与挑战的征途。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;虚拟运营商这十年&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;2012年起，在曾经对民资铁板一块的电信行业中，移动通信转售业务的大门被叩开了。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;移动通信转售业务，是指从拥有移动网络的基础电信运营商手里购买移动通信服务，重新包装成自有品牌并销售给最终用户。转售业务通常被认为是虚拟运营的一种形式。因此，这些获批的移动通信转售企业，被称为虚拟运营商。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;据南方周末记者统计，目前工信部下发的移动通信转售牌照已达39张。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;分享通信董事长蒋志祥告诉南方周末记者，虚拟运营商业务是基础电信业务的有效补充，意味着新的商业机会出现。 “在电信行业我们原本就给基础电信运营商做服务、做支撑。国家能开放这样的机会，我们当然要积极申请这个牌照。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;令他没想到的是，在这条新的赛道上，企业走得并不顺利。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2017年，分享通信被曝经营出现重大问题。这是自2013年12月工信部下发批文、允许虚拟运营试点以来，第一次有虚拟运营商曝出巨额欠款、业务停滞。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“获得移动转售牌照3年多来，分享通信积极探索虚商经营，用户发展数量位居前列，取得的成绩有目共睹。但由于初期投资巨大，加上批零倒挂、承诺收入等，分享通信一直在负债经营。”在2017年3月7日的记者沟通会上，蒋志祥详细介绍了公司债务，“三大运营商的欠款1.3亿元、制卡结算款1500万元、清退河南合伙人的退款700万元、员工工资1000万元、个人约200万元。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;蒋志祥向南方周末记者透露，作为虚拟运营商，不仅要租借基础运营商的网络，还要建立自己的客服系统、计费系统。此外，虚拟运营商的很大一部分成本在于给渠道商的收入分成，“卖我的卡，我每个月从话费里提10%给你”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;从逻辑上来讲，虚拟运营商手机卡套餐价格应该会比基础电信运营商的更贵。但实际上，为了吸引用户和形成竞争优势，虚拟运营商都在烧钱，往往以较低的价格和吸人眼球的“靓号”来拉拢客户。 “批零倒挂”（即批发价比零售价高）现象成为制约虚拟运营商盈利的重要原因。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;中国虚拟运营商产业联盟秘书长邹学勇曾对媒体表示，用户从基础运营商那里购买1M流量价格在5分钱左右，但是（基础运营商）给虚拟运营商的价格却在1毛到1毛5，要高出1倍左右，批零倒挂很严重。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;独立电信分析师付亮向南方周末记者表示，基础运营商大规模的提速降费，也给虚拟运营商的生产经营带来巨大压力。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“基础电信运营商给我们的（资费）在降，他们自己也在降，而且降得更厉害。”蒋志祥说，批零倒挂现象一直存在，导致虚拟运营商很多折扣做不下来，难以与基础电信运营商竞争。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;经历了初期用户快速增长之后，虚拟运营商的用户数目前呈下降态势。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;中国信息通信研究院数据显示，截至2019年10月底，移动转售在网用户数达1.36亿，占中国移动电话用户数的7.84%。到2022年底，中国移动通信转售用户数只剩8600万户，占中国移动用户总数的比重降至4.7%。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;对于本身业务发展能力较低的企业而言，虚拟运营商牌照并没有“雪中送炭”，而是跟随着主体公司“一损俱损”，甚至拖累公司业绩。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;南方周末记者调查发现，多家虚拟运营商经营出现困难，发展之路非常艰难。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;曾被外界称为国内移动、联通、电信之外“第四大运营商”的ST鹏博士（600804.SH）在2022年营业收入37.05亿元，归属于上市公司股东的净利润为-4.76亿元；乐语通讯于2014年由旗下有电子卖场宏图三胞的三胞集团收购，但三胞集团2017年陷入债务危机，目前控股公司ST宏图（600122.SH）正面临被强制退市的风险；前身是“巴士在线”的中麦控股有限公司，其法定代表人王献蜀也被限制高消费。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;电信诈骗也几乎是虚拟运营商江湖里公开的秘密。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2019年11月29日，工信部信息通信管理局针对部分移动转售企业垃圾信息严重扰民问题，集体约谈了小米移动、分享通信等18家移动转售企业。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;蒋志祥向南方周末记者透露，诈骗分子曾利用公司管控的问题进行洗钱。 “比如说我100元的电话卡，给渠道商留出了80元拓展用户。但渠道商利用机器群发垃圾短信，打诈骗电话、骚扰电话。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2023年2月16日，中国信息通信研究院专家陶承怡在一次会议上发表主题演讲《移动转售业务发展回顾及展望》时称，移动转售企业诈骗电话被举报量在2021年到达峰值1.2万件后，网络安全管理局采取了严监管措施，2022年降至4377件。垃圾信息在2019年出现猛增，也是在信息通信管理局采取严监管措施后快速下降。但2022年垃圾短信被举报量回升，同比增长超过100%；骚扰电话同样出现反弹迹象。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;从最初电信改革者的新锐形象，沦为如今电信诈骗重灾区，虚拟运营商们正面临严重的信任危机。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;通信行业专家、信息消费联盟理事长项立刚对南方周末记者表示，“三大基础电信运营商在全国最偏僻的小镇都设有营业厅，他们精耕细作，没有太大的竞争空间留给虚拟运营商，一些虚拟运营商只好去做诈骗和推销。”&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;联通混改之路&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;2017年的中国联通混改曾经也是民间资本进入电信领域的标志性事件。作为央企整体混改的第一单，联通混改被赋予了标杆性的示范意义。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;那时，中国联通也到了不得不改的地步。以2017年上半年数据看，中国联通(600050.SH)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;实现服务收入1241.1亿元，净利润24.2亿元。而中国移动实现营收3889亿元，净利润627亿元；中国电信同期营收1841.2亿元，净利润125.4亿元。从净利润规模的角度看，联通不到中国移动的4%，不到中国电信的20%。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;国务院国有资产监督管理委员会研究中心原研究员许保利曾长期关注国企改革，他向南方周末记者表示，与中国移动相比，中国联通市场地位偏弱。把中国联通作为混改的试点，也是为了规避风险，更为稳妥。 “中国联通的效益本身不是很好，引入民间资本是为了能够更好地解决其经营问题。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;经过多番平衡，联通混改最终敲定四大类别入围公司和机构：腾讯、百度、京东、阿里、苏宁云商等互联网公司；深圳光启集团、滴滴、网宿科技、用友、宜通世纪等垂直行业公司；中国人寿、中国中车等国企；国调基金、前海母基金两大产业基金。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;从股权结构来看，联通集团在上市公司从绝对控股（62.7%）退至相对控股（36.7%），虽然股权结构更为分散，但国有资本合计（加上新进场的中国人寿10.2%和国有企业结构调整基金6.1%）仍超过50%。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;联通混改涉及控制权的问题，即大股东持股达到30%以上，控制权不易旁落。许保利则认为，虽然民间资本在董事会的话语权有限，但仅从财务投资的角度来看，也会对中国联通的经营产生压力，在一定程度上倒逼其变革。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在电信行业资深分析师、达睿咨询创始人马继华看来，联通混改，可以有效补充中国联通的资金，为接下来与中国移动、中国电信的竞争准备“弹药”。此外，大型互联网企业也可给中国联通引入一些新思维、新业务。比如联通混改后，中国联通联合腾讯推出大王卡，并宣布与阿里巴巴集团相互开放云计算资源，在云业务层面开展深度合作。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;他补充道，“但这未能改变移动通信市场整体格局”。 2023年上半年，中国移动、中国电信以及中国联通营收总额分别为5307亿元、2587亿元以及1918亿元，中国联通的业绩和规模一直落后于中国移动和中国电信。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在混改过程中，中国联通也曾探索在省级公司层面落地，包括云南联通和广西联通。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2019年初，云南联通公开寻找民营合作方并最终确认了亨通光电、中电兴发、亚锦科技，三方与云南联通共同设立云南联通新通信有限公司，这家新成立的公司将负责引资建设、承包运营和员工改制。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;然而，省级公司混改并非一帆风顺。 2023年6月2日，中电兴发(002298.SZ)公告称，为有效解决云南联通综合改革当前存在的困难和问题，维护各方权益，经公司董事会会议审议通过了《关于全资子公司计划退出云南联通混改合作的议案》。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这也是继混改合作方亚锦科技、亨通光电之后，最后一家混改合作的民营股东退出。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2022年，中电兴发实现营业收入24.15亿元，同比下降12.84%，净利润-8.6亿元，同比大幅由盈转亏。 2022年报披露后，中电兴发收到了交易所问询函，在回复中，有多处涉及参与云南联通混改的情况。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;针对2022年收入下降，中电兴发表示，主要因为自主可控智慧城市解决方案及运营服务、大数据应用及运营服务分别实现营业收入4.56亿元、3.11亿元，分别同比下降45.35%、51.97%，毛利率分别为16.37%、37.69%，分别减少24.31%、13.76%。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在大数据应用及运营服务部分，收入下降的主要原因是公司参与云南联通混改项目和智慧国土项目，收入下降比例分别为74.41%和100.00%；这部分业务毛利率下降的主要原因，则是因为云南联通混改项目收入下降，而成本相对固定。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;参与云南联通混改也给中电兴发带来一定的减值损失，进而导致了净利润下降。根据中电兴发此前的回复，参与云南联通混改业务在2022年度出现了亏损，所持有的无形资产减值迹象较为明显，计提无形资产减值损失1.56亿元。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;为何参与混改的民营企业会相继退出？ &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;事实上，三家民营企业都是设备制造商中的底层通信耗材提供商，作为新公司三大股东，亨通光电、中电兴发、亚锦科技，一家是光纤光缆生产服务商，一家是城市及其他领域智慧解决方案提供商，另一家是电池制造商。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“三家民营企业的核心诉求是卖设备，而不是强化运营。”马继华认为，联通省公司混改引入的民营企业本身实力不够、资源不强，加之云南省山地多，人口分散，投资收益难成正比，因此很快分道扬镳。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;卫星互联网或是新机会&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;中国电信行业，长期由国有资本运营。以中国移动、中国联通、中国电信为代表的三家基础电信运营商主要提供公共数据传送、基础语音通信服务（固定电话、移动电话）和各种基础网络元素（电路、光缆、通信通道、基站、频段等）支持等基础电信业务。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;民间资本可以涉足的电信领域，在基础电信业务之外。目前已经开放的，包括宽带业务、移动转售业务及驻地网业务等。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;付亮向南方周末记者表示，三家基础电信运营商都不甘心只做管道，本身也在不断转型，与民间资本所擅长的领域已经形成竞争。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;如中国联通紧随虚拟运营商步伐，取消手机国内长途漫游费和流量漫游费、推出“流量当月不清零”、大幅降低国际长途漫游费、大幅下调宽带资费等。 “想要赢得竞争，除非开辟新的赛道。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在多位通信专家看来，此次工信部提出分步骤、分阶段推进卫星互联网业务准入制度改革，民间资本或许能迎来新的发展空间。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;所谓“卫星互联网”，是指可以提供宽带接入业务的卫星通信系统。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;相比传统的地面互联网，卫星互联网具有覆盖范围广、传输速度快、抗干扰能力强等优势。它可以为偏远地区、海洋、航空、铁路等无法通过传统网络接入的地方提供高速稳定的互联网服务。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;作为卫星互联网的主要商业形态之一，近期，海内外手机直连卫星正加速落地发展。日前，华为Mate60 Pro正式上架，这是全球首款搭载双星卫星通信的手机，支持天通卫星电话和双向北斗卫星消息，即使在无网情况下也可拨打、接听卫星电话。与之相配，中国电信“手机直连卫星”服务上线，除物联网卡和174号段以外的所有电信套餐均可办理，无需换卡或换号，开通直连卫星功能即可使用。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;近年来，中国低轨通信卫星呈现快速发展态势。 2020年4月，卫星互联网首次纳入“新基建”范围，卫星互联网建设已经上升为国家战略性工程，成为中国空天地一体化信息系统的重要组成部分。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;国际方面，自2015年SpaceX发布Starlink计划以来，OneWeb、亚马逊等众多科技巨头相继发布了卫星互联网星座计划，国际卫星互联空间争夺战的号角由此拉响；SpaceX在2019年开始加速推进“星链”建设，又一次将卫星互联网基建推向新的高潮。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在频率资源上，SpaceX的“星链”所占用的频率分布在Ku、Ka这两个黄金频段上，根据国际电信联盟（ITU）规定，在轨道资源上采取“先占先得”的规则，因此中国建设自己的低轨卫星互联网迫在眉睫。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“卫星建设不仅前期资金投入量大，后续还需定期更新星座，需要巨大的成本开支。”马继华认为，民营航天力量对于中国商业航天发展和卫星互联网建设至关重要，民营力量对于商业航天发射所需要大规模、快速迭代、充分竞争等要素有着天生的敏锐性与适应能力，民间资本在电信领域有望获得新的发展契机。 &lt;/p>;
