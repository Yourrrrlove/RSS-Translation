It is believed that staying up late, anxiety and chronic stress are important contributors to hair loss. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The first severe hair loss started from the top of the head. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A wide slit opens in the middle of the head, and gradually spreads to the left and right sides, turning into an oval. A large area of ​​scalp is exposed, and then spreads uncontrollably. The hair in other places begins to become soft and yellow. , in the end, the hair is like a mature dandelion, falling off with the slightest touch. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;As long as you sit down for a while, you will find that there are fallen hairs on the chair, arms, and clothes.&quot; Greedy said. Eight years ago, 20-year-old Gretchen started her own business overseas. In the three months before the trial opening of the store, she was in a high-pressure state of mental stress and physical exhaustion every day. McDonald&#39;s at three in the morning became her most frequent restaurant. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hair loss is the trace left on her body by this day and night hard work. As a daily lingo among young people, &quot;bald-headed&quot; is not only a description of appearance, but also a state of exhaustion in work and life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;25-35 years old, male, working in the IT industry, these three labels delineate the target group of hair transplant customers that Wang Xiaoping, director of Damai Microneedle Hair Transplantation Technology Research Institute, has the most contact with. According to CCTV News, a survey on people with hair loss released by the National Health Commission showed that the number of people with hair loss in my country has exceeded 250 million. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“The high pressure and fast pace of modern life have promoted the trend of younger hair loss from the environmental level. Taking common androgenic alopecia as an example, high mental stress, staying up late, and excessive exercise may all lead to Increased androgen levels will have a negative impact on hair follicles, leading to progressive miniaturization of hair follicles, which is manifested as hair gradually becoming thinner, softer or even falling off.&quot; Liu Yi, deputy chief physician at the Dermatology Hospital of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, told Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;Stress and staying up late &lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>; are &lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;directly reflected on the hair&quot; &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;After 35 years old Having just joined a pharmaceutical company as a sales assistant, &quot;older newcomer&quot; Fan Fan felt that everything was too difficult. One person is responsible for various data statistics and administrative management of a sales team of more than 100 people. She works overtime until late at night every day. When she was infected with the new coronavirus for the first time, she only took less than a day&#39;s rest before continuing to work. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fan Fan doesn’t dare to make mistakes, but no one is willing to spend time teaching him. The huge workload led to frequent mistakes, which often caused her to be stared at and scolded loudly. She did not dare to bring negative emotions to the workplace, &quot;for fear of being unemployed again at this age.&quot; In the end, all the anger was reserved for the family - &quot;I will yell at the child even if she calls her mother.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In February 2023, 37-year-old Fan Fan decided to resign naked. Two months later, her hairdresser informed her that she had alopecia areata on the top of her head. &quot;Long-term bad mood, insomnia, panic, and gastroenteritis made me realize that I had a serious problem. I decided to resign under the pressure of difficulty in re-employment. However, I soon fell into the anxiety of being unemployed again. I didn&#39;t expect that I would be unemployed again. Encountered alopecia areata.&quot; Fan Fan said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the &quot;China Alopecia Areata Diagnosis and Treatment Guidelines (2019)&quot; issued by the Chinese Medical Association, alopecia areata is a hair follicle-specific autoimmune disease caused by the combined effect of genetic factors and environmental factors, which is manifested by the sudden onset of clear-cut borders on the scalp. circular patchy hair loss. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2010, scholars such as Guo Hongwei from the Department of Dermatology at the Southwest Hospital of the Third Military Medical University investigated the correlation between stressful life events and the risk of alopecia areata. The study showed that mental stress plays a significant role in the onset of alopecia areata. , sleep changes are the most dangerous factor. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many &quot;bald young men&quot; who suffered from pathological hair loss randomly interviewed by Southern Weekend reporters all believed that staying up late, anxiety and chronic stress were important contributors to their hair loss. At a deeper level, it may be explained by the contemporary German philosopher Han Bingzhe&#39;s description of modern society as a &quot;merit society&quot; - people willingly fall into self-exploitation in a highly competitive environment and are exhausted in their efforts to realize their own value. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhu Yu, who loves to play &quot;Honor of Kings&quot;, &quot;particularly cares about winning or losing the game.&quot; After losing, he always wants to wait until he wins before the game ends. He stays up until four or five in the morning to fall asleep almost every day; designer Jiao Jiao She often goes to bed at three o&#39;clock in the middle of the night. When interviewed by a Southern Weekend reporter, she could not fall asleep until five or six o&#39;clock in the morning for a month. Aric, a software engineer, encounters unsolvable problems at work and becomes anxious and nervous to the point of insomnia. According to his observation, nearly half of the programmers around him are suffering from hair loss. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When she suffered massive hair loss, 24-year-old Tian Luo was the store manager of a real estate agency store in Shanghai. Her daily working hours were from 9 a.m. to 1 a.m. the next day, with six days off and one day off. Even on her only day off, Tian Luo couldn&#39;t truly rest as she had to deal with customer complaints and other work at any time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the year of graduation, Tian Luo came to the &quot;dream Shanghai&quot; from Yunnan, won the first place in regional sales performance from scratch, and was promoted to manager in two years. But like countless young people who feel confused in their struggle, Tian Luo suddenly felt that she had lost her sensitivity to everything around her. &quot;I only had work, performance pressure and staying up late in my eyes, which were directly reflected in my hair.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;If I just met you&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>; and I&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;are bald&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;, I&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;can’t choose you. As the other half&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The adolescence Chan Chan had shoulder-length hair. Since she started losing her hair, she has cut her hair shorter and shorter, keeping it above the chin all year round. She also lost 10 hairs, and long hair would visually cause a greater psychological burden on her. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Because of hair loss, the 1.65-meter-tall Grean Chan habitually walks at the highest point in the group. &quot;If you stand on the escalator first (when the elevator goes down) or stand on a lower step, and the people next to you can see the top of your head, I will try to stand behind you and stand higher than others.&quot;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;Medically, hair loss is usually divided into seven levels. Level 7 is the most severe severe hair loss, and Greedy was diagnosed with level 6. &quot;At that time, it was impossible to socialize at all. Whether I saw a rainbow, a shooting star, or any other occasion where I could make a wish, I would sincerely pray. My birthday wish every year is to make my hair grow back.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He Severe Along with the hair loss came a diagnosis of depression and anxiety. In his early twenties, Greedy often thought: What is so precious about youth? I&#39;d better live to be fifty as soon as possible, so that when others my age start to go bald, I won&#39;t look different from others. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ganchan and her boyfriend met in their freshman year. She was glad that her hair was not as thick as her scalp at that time. Although the other party never expressed concern about hair to Greedy, once, her boyfriend admitted, &quot;If you were like you are now (bald) when we first met, I really wouldn&#39;t be able to choose you as my other partner.&quot; half&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When he is most emotionally depressed, Greedy will blame all his unsatisfactory life and work on his hair loss. Sometimes I quarrel with my boyfriend, and I can&#39;t help but think to myself, &quot;If I had hair and wasn&#39;t as ugly as I am now, maybe he wouldn&#39;t quarrel with me.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Mobius strip&quot; of interaction between body and mind may help us better understand the relationship between hair loss and stress. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The diseases that negative emotions bring to the body are called psychosomatic diseases in the medical field - physical and organic diseases in which psychosocial factors play an important role in the onset and development. If the internal genetic factors causing hair loss are regarded as bullets, anxiety and internal friction are like triggers, which are important triggers that promote and aggravate the phenomenon of hair loss. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Physical illness in turn aggravates negative emotions, which can be called a physical and mental reaction, that is, physical illness becomes a psychological stressor and affects mental health. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“There is an interaction between physical health and mental health. This is because the human body’s nervous system, endocrine system and immune system interact with each other to jointly maintain the stability of the body’s internal environment. This interaction is a physiological and An important research area in the medical field is called the bio-psycho-social model. Many disfiguring skin diseases may cause patients to have anxiety, depression or self-esteem problems, which may lead to immune regulation disorders and further aggravate physical diseases.&quot; Liu Yi said . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A survey on anxiety and depression in patients with common psychosomatic skin diseases, published in &quot;Journal of Southeast University (Medical Edition)&quot;, showed that 17% of patients with skin diseases have psychological disorders that co-occur with their skin diseases. question. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Cui Shaofang, executive director and deputy CEO of Damai Hair Transplant Medical Group, told Southern Weekend reporters that the post-90s generation, who have become the main force in hair loss, often suffer from low self-esteem due to hair loss, which affects work and spouse selection. “Many people seeking hair transplant treatment The real desire of patients with hair loss is to build self-confidence, which prompts us to pay more attention to the mental health of people with hair loss.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;I&#39;m afraid that after I stop taking the medicine, &lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;the hair that grew out before will also &lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>; fall out&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p >;September 24, 2023, is the 378th day that Lan Pingping insists on using minoxidil. In more than a year, she experienced three &quot;crazy hair loss periods&quot;. Each time she washed her hair, she lost one to two hundred strands, which lasted about 20 days. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After long-term use of minoxidil, Lan Pingping found that her whole body had become hirsutious, and her scalp also had acne from time to time, but she never thought about stopping. The hair that came out also fell out.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In interviews with reporters from Southern Weekend, almost all hair loss patients admitted that they have used common anti-hair loss products on the market, including but not limited to anti-hair loss shampoos, laser hair growth caps, scalp essences, massage combs, and five-part anti-hair loss products. Black powder, black sesame balls, etc. Among them, the most commonly mentioned is minoxidil hair growth solution administered as an over-the-counter drug. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Minoxidil was originally a drug used to treat high blood pressure, but was accidentally discovered to promote hair growth. Liu Yi believes that there is some abuse of minoxidil due to promotion by e-commerce platforms and self-media. Although minoxidil is relatively safe, it may also cause some side effects, such as local allergies or irritation reactions, hirsutism, etc., and in a few cases, it may even cause a drop in blood pressure, tachycardia, etc. Therefore, its application is best carried out under the guidance of a doctor to avoid abuse and overdose to ensure safety and effectiveness. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;First, minoxidil is a therapeutic drug, and it is not necessary to use it for the purpose of preventing hair loss when hair loss does not occur; second, although androgenic alopecia is the main cause of hair loss, Causes, but telogen effluvium, alopecia areata, etc. are also very common, and some patients may be accompanied by other underlying diseases, so the type of hair loss should be judged by a doctor before treatment. For example, diffuse alopecia areata, the clinical manifestations can be similar to androgenic alopecia, but used alone Minoxidil is usually not very effective,&quot; Liu Yi said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After a long illness, Greanman often reads research papers in the field of hair loss and thinks he has tried almost every anti-hair loss product on the market. She has bought five to six thousand yuan of supplements from domestic micro-businessmen that claim to &quot;radically cure hair loss&quot;, and has also spent 10,000 yuan to buy imported 650 nanometer laser hair caps. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In her opinion, some high-priced products actually have low raw materials and are just an &quot;IQ tax&quot; labeled &quot;anti-hair loss&quot;. Most products have limited help in hair growth, and it is difficult to produce visible hair loss when used alone. Visible hair growth effects. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the &quot;Cosmetics Supervision and Administration Regulations&quot; that will be implemented in 2021, the original hair growth cosmetics category will be cancelled. Hair growth cosmetics that have obtained the &quot;National Cosmetic Special Label&quot; in the past will be classified as &quot;hair growth cosmetics&quot; after a five-year transition period. Stop production and sales. Newly added anti-hair loss cosmetics are registered and managed as &quot;special purpose cosmetics&quot; and require efficacy testing at a cosmetics administrative licensing inspection agency. They can be produced and sold only after approval by the State Food and Drug Administration. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu Yi believes that the popularity of anti-hair loss products shows that the current hair loss problem still faces huge unmet clinical needs. &quot;For androgenic alopecia, the most common type of hair loss, currently only two drugs, finasteride and minoxidil, are approved for treatment in China. However, some patients have poor efficacy, coupled with safety concerns and other factors, Therefore, there is a demand for alternative methods in the market.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;Build your own combination boxing&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In 2021, Greedy decided to finally fight for Shengfa She tried her best once, and if she failed again, she decided to let herself go. &quot;I can&#39;t continue to struggle in the whirlpool of hair loss. Even if I have no hair and wear a wig all my life, I still want to be a happy little girl.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Gantan listed the experience he gained from seeking medical treatment for seven years, and created a set of &quot;hair growth combination boxing&quot; methods that cover washing and care steps, medication combination, dietary structure, and work and rest adjustments. Looking back, Greedy thinks that was the moment when &quot;the gears of his destiny began to turn.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;When I completely relaxed my mood, adjusted my lifestyle, and followed my DIY method for two months, my scalp began to be covered with new hair, and my hair grew back again.&quot; Speaking of this &quot;Miracle&quot;, Greedy still finds it incredible. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this set of combos, Greedy insists on completing at least two of the three things &quot;eat well, sleep well, feel good&quot; every day. She made a video of her experience and shared it on the Internet, which received tens of thousands of likes. Greanman discovered that she was not the only one suffering from hair loss. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, once alopecia is diagnosed, it is likely that you will need to fight it for life. Waiting for the emergence of new technologies and reconciling with oneself have become life issues for &quot;bald young people&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fu Hongbo, a 22-year-old senior in college, was diagnosed with androgenic alopecia. After using minoxidil for nearly a year with no obvious results, he chose to go to a hair transplant institution for forehead transplantation. To his surprise, the forehead after hair transplantation was still visibly sparse, accompanied by a large amount of shedding. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tu Ming, dean of Yonghe’s hair transplant business, told Southern Weekend reporters that the principle of hair transplantation is to transplant healthy hair follicles from the occipital area of ​​the body to areas with sparse hair. It is mainly used in androgenic alopecia. With current technical means, androgenic alopecia cannot be cured. Therefore, hair transplantation can improve the current aesthetic problem, but it does not mean that hair loss can be stopped after hair transplantation. Controlling hair loss to a more satisfactory level requires long-term medication and maintenance. treat. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Looking at the slightly M-angled hairline of his newborn son, Aric worried that his M-shaped hair loss would be passed on to the next generation. Fu Hongbo&#39;s way of explaining his explanation is &quot;I believe in the development of science and technology. Maybe hair follicle cloning technology will appear in a few years to completely solve this problem.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The medical community never stops working hard. In June 2023, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Pfizer&#39;s new drug Ritlecitinib for the treatment of alopecia areata in adolescents and adults aged 12 years and older. Ritexitinib becomes the first drug approved to treat adolescents with alopecia areata. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Compared with baricitinib, the first treatment for severe alopecia areata in adults approved in China, ritexitinib has a stronger targeting effect on the autoimmune inflammatory pathways related to alopecia areata. It is safer and more effective, bringing new breakthroughs in the treatment of alopecia areata,&quot; Liu Yi said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Now, Greedy is a &quot;hair growth blogger&quot; with 100,000 followers on social media. There are always people leaving private messages, asking her to recommend a product that is most helpful for hair growth. Gretchen replies over and over again: &quot;Don&#39;t believe that any product can cure your hair loss. The only way is to start by changing your lifestyle.&quot; , build your own combination punch.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As a brand manager engaged in marketing and product development, Mei Lan was diagnosed with diffuse alopecia areata in June 2022. After experiencing hair loss for half a year, Mei Lan seemed to have been reborn. &quot;No matter how busy you are at work, you still have to exercise every day. People always have to give themselves some space. When life is no longer limited to one branch, I naturally no longer care about the gains and losses on this road, because I will have many branches.&quot;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;It is not easy to make peace with yourself and hair loss. Her hair is like a greedy experimental field. She keeps sowing seeds on it. Sometimes the harvest is poor and sometimes it is abundant. Even if she has a set of &quot;combination punches&quot; to deal with it, sometimes a mood swing is enough to destroy all the hard work and she has to start from scratch. came. But the good news is that as long as you continue to maintain a good attitude and living habits, everything will happily get better. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Glutton never broke up with her boyfriend of nine years. They got married in 2023. When looking back on this relationship, she wrote -&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Actually, whether you are bald or not, It does not hinder true love and being loved.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(Except for Wang Xiaoping, Liu Yi, Cui Shaofang, and Tu Ming, the rest of the recipients The visitor’s name is a pseudonym)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 30 Sep 2023 12:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[网络炒热的韩国防猝死套餐，是真的要命]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257412]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-30 11:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/30/JDT8Ejb6qBaGrTcyi4GdEVs1TtAJGoO77KOirq5R.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;719&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/30/JDT8Ejb6qBaGrTcyi4GdEVs1TtAJGoO7 7KOirq5R. jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;252839&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（IC photo/图） &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Recently, a sudden death prevention package that is said to have become popular in South Korea has been on the hot search. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;This package is composed of coenzyme Q10, fish oil, lutein, vitamin D3 and other health products. Some netizens shared that they feel very energetic after taking it. Questioning that such a &quot;sudden death prevention package&quot; does not really have the effect of preventing sudden death. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In this regard, some experts believe that sudden death is a type of disease, and health food itself does not have a clinical role in treatment or prevention. It can be eaten but can only be used as a Health aid. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In the final analysis, the &quot;sudden death prevention package&quot; has triggered heated discussions, mainly due to the mentality of contemporary young people who love to stay up late and are afraid of sudden death. The truly effective &quot;sudden death prevention method&quot; &quot;what exactly is it? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/22/d065c741f2.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;548&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/22/d065c741f2.png&quot; data-key=&quot;251683&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Why do people die suddenly? &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;First of all, let’s look at why people die suddenly from a medical perspective. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;No other disease can compare with the suddenness, urgency, severity, malignancy and consequences of sudden death. The occurrence of sudden death is unexpected and cannot be predicted in most cases. This is why sudden death is the most terrible disease in the world. Clinically, sudden death can be divided into two categories, namely sudden cardiac death and non-cardiac sudden death. Among all patients who die suddenly, 75% are caused by heart disease, the most common cause of which is coronary heart disease; about 25% are caused by non-cardiac diseases (i.e., the patient has causes other than the heart). &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In order to facilitate understanding, I divide it into internal causes and external causes. The internal cause is the premature aging of the body&#39;s own functions, weakening the ability to decompose and eliminate metabolic waste and toxins entering the body and produced by the body itself, resulting in abnormal body metabolism, increased blood lipids, blood sugar, and uric acid, and excessive accumulation of fat in the internal organs, blood, and subcutaneous tissue. Formation of atherosclerotic plaques (fatty plaques that line the walls of arteries). &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Once these plaques rupture, they will immediately stimulate coagulation function in the corresponding blood vessels, forming thrombus almost instantly. If a certain branch of the heart blood vessel is blocked, Sudden death will occur if the heart is suddenly ischemic. Therefore, maintaining a youthful state of the body and improving the normal functions of various organ systems in the body are fundamental to prevention. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;External factors refer to various factors outside the body and attached to the body, which lead to the deterioration of physical conditions. This is all too common in the workplace: the glamorous appearance cannot conceal the tiredness caused by working overtime and staying up late, the pressure from bosses, superiors and project progress, open and secret fights between peers and colleagues, commuting to and from work, squeezing in elevators, subways, heavy traffic jams, and lack of sleep. , irregular diet, having to socialize with each other, lack of exercise, supporting a family, and all kinds of consumption for the sake of face...&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;All of these are overdrafting your body , making the already disordered hormone secretion and metabolic system in your body even more overwhelmed, exacerbating the possibility of tragedy. That is to say, insufficient rest, insufficient and extremely unbalanced nutrients, and long-term mental stress, resulting in the body being unable to repair and improve itself normally. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In fact, the most fundamental thing is that your heart function is already in a bad state, but you don&#39;t know it at all. Coupled with the above-mentioned workplace pressures, the chance of sudden death greatly increases. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/30/Hl2cmWoPON0F3tUJkXGtlvba93yX5nhFYxqhQTdi.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/30/Hl2cmWoPON0F3tUJkXGtlvba93yX5nhFYxqhQTdi.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;252840&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（IC photo/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; >;&lt;strong>;You can’t just resign and quit, right? &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Some people say that my working status is like this, I can’t resign, right? &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In fact, for some people, resigning may be a good idea. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;However, if you have to stick to this job in order to support your family, try to make the following adjustments, which will not only prevent sudden death, but more importantly It can make up for your overdrafted health and live a healthy life for yourself and your family. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;1. First go to a regular hospital and ask a responsible doctor to do a comprehensive physical examination (especially to check for hidden cardiovascular diseases). &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;2. Scientific diet and balanced nutrition: A reasonable dietary structure means that the nutrients contained in the diet are complete in variety, sufficient in quantity, and in appropriate proportions to satisfy both needs and requirements. It can meet the physiological needs of the body and avoid imbalances in the proportion of nutrients in the diet (or even nutritional disorders caused by lack or excess of certain nutrients). &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;It is best to have three meals a day: a. Vegetables and fruits: more varieties are better, mainly supplementing vitamins, minerals and antioxidants, etc., every day The number of meals should be at least equivalent to the size of one&#39;s own fist; b. Protein foods: mainly supplement various amino acids, trace elements, vitamins, etc. necessary for the human body, including meat proteins (such as seafood, chicken, duck, and fish meat), each meal The quantity is equivalent to the size of your palm minus your fingers) and non-meat proteins (eggs, milk, soy products, etc., the quantity of each meal is equivalent to the size of your fist); c. Grain and starch foods: various rice and flour products, potatoes Categories, corn, etc., mainly supplement starch (sugar), vitamins, dietary fiber, etc. The amount of each meal is equivalent to the size of your own fist. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;However, according to a random survey of more than 10,000 people by relevant research institutions in the United States, the vast majority of people are unable to achieve truly balanced nutrition through diet. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;3. Adhere to scientific and reasonable exercise: According to the results of the physical examination, combined with physical condition and time, carry out step-by-step exercise (you can practice by yourself, or you can go to the gym to do it) Personal training depends on your own hobbies and level of wealth). However, no matter where you exercise, the so-called aerobic exercise (such as running, swimming, cycling, etc.) and anaerobic exercise (mainly strength exercise) must be closely integrated and indispensable, and must reach a certain intensity. Only then will your exercise have a real effect on improving physical function. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;4. Develop good living habits: Try not to stay up late. You may not feel the harm once or twice occasionally. Staying up late for a long time is overdrafting your health. . Adequate and high-quality sleep is a necessary means for the body to repair itself and regulate its functions. Overdraft without actively replenishing it is like a mobile phone battery that has been depleted but not recharged in time. The final result can be imagined. As for the harm that heavy drinking (whether short-term or long-term habitual) does to the body, even if I don’t say it, most people will understand it! &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;5. Emotional management: Although it is difficult to control emotions in a busy working environment, remember not to let yourself be overjoyed or sad. This is meaningful to ensure that you can live a healthy and safe life and maintain a harmonious family and society. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;6. Supplement safe and effective health products: If you accept the basic common sense that the human body is composed of substances, you should understand that without an adequate material basis, the functions will not be sufficient. How much better would it be. Theoretically, all injuries in the human body can be cured through its own repair. The basic raw materials for repair are nutrients such as protein, lipids, sugars, vitamins, minerals, dietary fiber and water. However, the reality is that today’s food can no longer provide adequate and balanced nutrition to the body. Therefore, it is not a question of whether to take health supplements or not, but that you have to take health supplements for your health. Everyone&#39;s nutritional deficiencies exist objectively, but the degree of deficiency is different. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;7. Appropriate drug intervention for discovered diseases: However, drugs only target symptoms, they are not the fundamental factor in solving the problem. The contribution of medical intervention to human health only accounts for about 10%, and the rest is the result of the above comprehensive factors. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;I found someone suspected of sudden death, what should I do? &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;What should you do if you find someone suspected of sudden death? &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;First, identify cardiac arrest and call 120 emergency services. Second, take cardiopulmonary resuscitation measures quickly. I won’t go into details about the specific steps. The principle is to check breathing and heartbeat, and clear the airway, and then perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation mainly with chest compressions (if it is a sudden cardiac arrest). &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The compression position is in the middle left of the sternum (most people&#39;s heart is in the left chest), 100 to 120 times per minute, and the depth is 5 to 6 centimeters. The key is to continue compressions until professional rescuers arrive. Third, implement defibrillation as soon as possible. For sudden cardiac arrest, the most effective first aid method is electric defibrillation. If it is done one minute earlier, the patient&#39;s hope of survival will increase by 10%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 30 Sep 2023 11:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[中国男篮亚运两连胜，球员坦言球队仍需成长适应大赛强度]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257936]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-30 10:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;On September 28, 2023, Chinese team player Zhang Zhenlin broke through Chinese Taipei under the basket The player defends and shoots the basket.&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/30/48085416cd.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;719&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/30/48085416cd.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252832&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On September 28, 2023, Chinese team player Zhang Zhenlin broke through the defense of Chinese Taipei team players under the basket and shot. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On September 28, 2023, in the Asian Games Basketball Men’s Preliminary Group B match at the Hangzhou Olympic Sports Center Gymnasium, the Chinese team ushered in the first place in the group stage.

Liang Gewen, the former Secretary of the Qingyuan Municipal Party Committee, mentioned it again. The &quot;Qingyuan Experience&quot; evolved from the 5 yuan reward. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Qingyuan Experience&quot; was an attempt by Qingyuan to expand enterprise autonomy and mobilize workers&#39; enthusiasm at the beginning of reform and opening up, and pioneered the reform of state-owned enterprises in Guangdong. Over the past 45 years, the &quot;Qingyuan Experience&quot; advocating &quot;dare to be the first&quot; has continued to play different roles in various historical periods. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to Liang Gewen, the event also invited Deng Sai from the Party Building Office of the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of Guangdong Province and Lu Guowei, member of the Party Branch of Lianzhang Village, Lianjiangkou Town, Yingde City. The three of them witnessed different stages of reform and opening up. . Deng Sai was one of the first batch of civil servants recruited openly when the Provincial State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission was established in 2004. He has deep feelings about the reform of state-owned enterprises in the past two decades. Lu Guowei shared the great changes in Lianzhang Village in the past five years from the perspective of a grassroots poverty alleviation cadre. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the event, the 80-year-old Liang Gewen always emphasized that today we still need to emancipate our minds and boldly innovate. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;More work, more rewards, turn losses into profits&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In 1978, on the eve of reform and opening up, Qingyuan began to implement the &quot;exceeding plan profit commission bonus&quot; reform . Liang Gewen, then the press secretary of the Qingyuan County Party Committee, was 35 years old. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liang Gewen has a deep understanding of Qingyuan’s traffic. Qingyuan is located in the mountainous area of ​​northern Guangdong and has inconvenient transportation. At that time, there was no road from Qingyuan to Guangzhou, so one had to cross the river by boat and then take a bumpy car. Liang Gewen went to Guangzhou to deliver articles to newspapers. Riding a motorcycle was faster than a car. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The geographical location led to Qingyuan&#39;s economic backwardness to a certain extent. Its economic aggregate and fiscal revenue basically ranked at the bottom of the province at that time. In 1977, Qingyuan failed to complete the profit plan issued by the state and suffered a loss of more than 300,000 yuan. Some companies even needed to borrow money from the local government to pay workers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Because workers eat from a big pot, it doesn’t make much difference whether they work more or less. Qingyuan’s largest state-owned nitrogen fertilizer factory at the time faced the problem of workers being passive and slow in working. The nitrogen fertilizer plant, which was put into operation in 1970, was the largest factory with the most workers in Qingyuan at that time. However, the annual output of a medium-sized fertilizer factory with more than 400 people was only more than 5,000 tons at its peak. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Output cannot increase, and the factory has been losing money year after year. According to factory employees, when farmers queued up to buy fertilizer, some people started fighting over it. &quot;If fertilizers cannot keep up, food production will be reduced, and farmers will have to look for fertilizers everywhere.&quot; Liang Gewen said. During the busy farming season of July and August every year, the county party committee secretary would come to the factory to supervise production. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The turning point occurred in October 1978. A policy called &quot;Super Planned Profit Commission Award&quot; was first piloted at Qingyuan Nitrogen Fertilizer Plant. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before this reform, there was an accident in the factory. A worker accidentally closed the wrong valve of a gas tank, causing the gas tank to become severely deformed. According to past experience, it takes three months to repair. In order to meet the construction deadline, the factory leaders summoned technical personnel from all over Qingyuan and promised that whoever could repair the equipment and resume production in advance would be rewarded 5 yuan. In the end, it only took 10 days to complete the task. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What is the concept of 5 yuan? At that time, workers&#39; monthly salary was 33 yuan. In order to support their families, many workers go to the mountains to cut firewood, go down to the rivers to catch fish, and fish for snails in the fields after get off work to increase their income. &quot;Five yuan can buy eight pounds of pork. At that time, the target was half a pound of pork per person per month.&quot; Liang Gewen said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This incident made the factory leaders realize that incentives can be used to mobilize motivation. In the atmosphere of great discussion on the issue of truth standards, the nitrogen fertilizer plant also held a discussion meeting. An agreement was reached at the meeting to improve everyone&#39;s enthusiasm through reforming the reward system. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since October 1978, the county party committee began to pilot the &quot;exceeding plan profit commission award&quot; in four plants including the nitrogen fertilizer plant. &quot;For example, if we plan to hand over 1 million yuan in profits, if the annual profit is 1.5 million yuan, we will take part of the 500,000 yuan and distribute it to the workers.&quot; Liang Gewen explained. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Under the mechanism of more reward for more work, the efficiency of the factory has been significantly improved. After 18 days of trial operation, a profit of 35,000 yuan was achieved in the month. This was also the first month to achieve profit in nine years of production. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Opposition&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Reform is not without opposition. Some departments in the county consider this to be a &quot;private division of state property.&quot; Fortunately, with the support of county leaders, it was implemented. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The reform of the nitrogen fertilizer plant has even attracted the attention of the Guangdong Provincial Government. But the opinions in the province are not unified. In May 1979, the finance and labor departments of Guangdong Province jointly issued a document requiring Qingyuan County to stop implementing the &quot;exceeding plan profit commission award.&quot; The reason is that there is a lack of documentary evidence and the commission ratio is too large. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Three months later, at the group discussion of the Guangdong Provincial Industrial Transportation Production Increase and Conservation Conference, the debate on the &quot;Qingyuan Experience&quot; was settled. The meeting decided to promote Qingyuan’s “Exceeding Plan Profit Commission Award” to county-owned industrial enterprises across Guangdong Province. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is worth mentioning that since turning losses into profits in 1979, the nitrogen fertilizer plant has achieved profits every year. By 1989, it had achieved a total profit of nearly 10 million yuan for 11 consecutive years. In the years that followed, Liang Gewen was often asked about the impact of the &quot;Qingyuan Experience&quot; on Guangdong. His answer was simple - the most important thing was that the cadres and masses of the nitrogen fertilizer plant dared to be the first and boldly innovated. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The courage to be the first and bold innovation in the &quot;Qingyuan Experience&quot; have also taken root in the reform of state-owned enterprises in Guangdong Province. According to Deng Sai, since the three-year action of state-owned enterprise reform was launched in 2020, &quot;Guangdong&#39;s state-owned economic layout structure has also undergone major changes, and state-owned capital has become more concentrated in important industries and key areas related to the national economy and people&#39;s livelihood.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is understood that as of the end of 2022, the total assets of local state-owned assets supervision enterprises in Guangdong Province reached 16.27 trillion yuan, ranking third among local supervision enterprises in the country. In 2022, the operating income and profits of local state-owned assets supervision enterprises in the province The total amount ranked third and second in the country respectively. Among the province&#39;s local state-owned assets supervision enterprises, 6 have entered the Fortune Global 500. &quot;This means that Guangdong&#39;s state-owned economy continues to grow in scale and strength, and is promoting the sustained and healthy development of the national economy.&quot; Deng Sai said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lianzhang Village, located in the northeast of Qingyuan City, is experiencing the &quot;Qingyuan Experience&quot; in the new era. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Born in 1993, Lu Guowei is a native of Lianzhang Village. He often hears people mention the story of the reform of the nitrogen fertilizer plant. In 2017, Lu Guowei returned to his hometown and became a grassroots poverty alleviation cadre. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lu Guowei remembers that when he was a child, Lianzhang Village was one of the poorest villages in Lianjiangkou Town. The village was surrounded by mountains and only connected to the outside world by a rugged road. The village&#39;s pillar industry was Sugar orange. &quot;Except for a small amount of rice, peanuts, and corn, every household grows sugar oranges,&quot; Lu Guowei said. In 2011, affected by Huanglongbing, almost all the sugar orange trees in the village were wiped out. In the end, except for a small number of people planting bamboo shoots, most young adults chose to go out to work, while the elderly and children stayed behind in the village. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In recent years, Lianzhang Village has gradually explored new paths for rural development. On the basis of vigorously developing specialty industries such as bamboo shoots and black tea, it also simultaneously promotes the intensive processing of specialty agricultural products. Lu Guowei said that currently there are more than 20 small and large enterprises stationed in the village, realizing everyone&#39;s wish to work at home. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Whether it is for Lianzhang Village or Qingyuan, we still have to dare to think and act.&quot; Liang Gewen said with emotion. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 30 Sep 2023 09:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[在诺奖得主古尔纳的故乡，大海不再只有伤痛 | 月是故乡明②]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257356]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-30 08:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/ 11/07/b840996666c29ba0936ba0ac8e934fd8.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;578&quot; height=&quot;386&quot; data-src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/11/07/ b840996666c29ba0936ba0ac8e934fd8.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;169416&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span>;Zanzibar, a woman picks up seaweed at low tide. /ICphoto&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;On the occasion of the New Year in 2016, I came to Zanzibar for the first time - &quot;Unguja Island&quot; from the southern big island&lt;/span>;&lt;span style =&quot;color: #888888;&quot;>;(also known as &quot;Zanzibar Island&quot;)&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;, the northern island &quot;Pemba Island&quot; and other small islands, hereinafter referred to as &quot;Zanzibar Island&quot;—— The capital of Stone Town&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #888888;&quot;>;(&quot;StoneTown&quot;)&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;, on a hazy morning at sunrise, I walked to the edge of the Indian Ocean with jagged reefs.

Every November, the southwest monsoon and ocean currents blow through southern India, southern Arabia and the coast of Somalia, to San Island, and then further south to the Comoros Islands and Madagascar. Before tourism became the main industry of Sand Island, the vast majority of people in Stone Town relied on the sea for their livelihood, including fishermen, sailors and merchants who came and went with the wind. At one time, there were dangerous merchants who sold ivory, spices and slaves. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In today&#39;s Stone City, various houses of different sizes are dotted along the entire coastline. Many are Islamic-style buildings, and a few are decorated with complicated European patterns. It has been converted into post offices, office buildings, cafes, restaurants and private residences, among which there are many simple shabby iron shacks owned by local fishermen. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;At the beginning of 2019, I came to Stone City for the third time. Taking advantage of the New Year holiday, I wandered around for nearly a week, looking at the remains of the ancient shell city wall seven or eight centuries ago.

It was hidden, but it was empty inside. It is not clear whether the house is for private or public use. Walking around the alley next to the house to the backyard, you can see a group of little boys wearing robes and square hats. They are squatting and playing with marbles and soda bottle caps. On the other side of the yard, there were several men leaning against the wall. They crossed their arms and talked about the rainy season, the wind direction and the lowest price for buying lilacs. Behind them were several women who set up small stalls selling fruits and vegetables. They seemed to be selling scattered dried fish, cherry tomatoes and onions. In fact, they were more interested in chatting. It didn&#39;t matter whether the things could be sold or not. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The sun was setting at that time, and the light shone just right in the yard and on the roof, and finally briefly settled on the sweaty brows and cheeks of men, women, old and young. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;After walking out of the yard, I went to a cafe across the street, ordered a cup of Americano with clove flavor, and pulled out an old book from the bookshelf. The book is called &quot;Eye of Cloves&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #888888;&quot;>;(&quot;Eye of Cloves&quot;, F.D. Omani)&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;, published in 1955. When I opened it, I didn&#39;t have any expectations, it was just to kill time. Sand Island is called the &quot;Lilac Island&quot;, so judging from this title, it is not much different from most travel books about Sand Island. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;I flipped through the pages of the book until I saw an old black and white photo. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Isn’t that square house and yard in the photo the same place I just passed by? More than fifty years have passed, and nothing seems to have changed. It seems that even people&#39;s status and clothing have been frozen at that moment. The adults sit or stand bored, and the children run or jump carefree. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The caption of the photo reads: Arab residential area. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;This description can be used to summarize almost any neighborhood I passed through today, but to put it more accurately, most of the neighborhoods can be called &quot;Indian Arab Swahili&quot; Xili Mixed Residential Area&quot;. Because in today&#39;s Stone City, the vast majority of locals are accustomed to interracial trade, mixing, and intermarriage. It is difficult to accurately identify whether a person is of Arab, Indian, Southeast Asian, or Sri Lankan descent just by looking at his skin color and dress. With Vasili ancestry or a mixture of two or even three of them, almost everyone became a &quot;Zanzibar&quot;. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/11/07/b916a255dac148c595805f20cc1d0b79.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 0&quot; height=&quot;0&quot; data-src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/11/07/b916a255dac148c595805f20cc1d0b79.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;169420&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;Overlooking Stone City/Visual China&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span >;In 2015, Gurner mentioned this residential area in a lecture at the University of Kent where he teaches. He was born and grew up in Stone Town, an area generally known as the &quot;Arab residential area.&quot; He projected a related black-and-white photo in class. The photo showed a small square house with a simple two-story building standing on the left. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;blockquote data-type=&quot;2&quot; data-url=&quot;&quot; data-author-name=&quot;&quot; data-content-utf8-length=&quot;98&quot; data-source-title=&quot;&quot; >; &lt;p>;&quot;I was born in the small building on the left. When I was a child, we always stood on the terrace on the second floor and watched the sailing ships leaving the port or returning from the sea, one after another, loaded with various goods. If you go downstairs and pass through the courtyard downstairs, you will see a workplace, a warehouse, and a vegetable market behind it.&lt;/p>; &lt;/blockquote>; &lt;blockquote data-type=&quot;2&quot; data-url= &quot;&quot; data-author-name=&quot;&quot; data-content-utf8-length=&quot;244&quot; data-source-title=&quot;&quot;>; &lt;p>;But what you can’t see from the photo is what kind of person he is. Live in this place. If you could see them, you might feel helpless like me. Why? Because when the outside world talks about us and this place, they will always savagely describe it as The complexity and richness are summed up in these seven colorless words (referring to the &quot;Arab residential area&quot;)... But in fact, in the house at the back, there lived an Indian family; next to them, lived The president of the Lilac Planting Association is an Englishman; the house on the far side is the local police station, and the chief is a San Island native of Somali descent; behind the police station is a cafe run by a Yemeni businessman... But According to convention, this is only an Arab residential area.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;/blockquote>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Gulna described all this calmly to the thoughtful college students in the audience, except for the slightly wrinkled Meifeng, no emotion can be seen. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;I think of that photo taken in 1955. Gurna was only about 7 years old that year. Maybe he was among the group of children playing in the background of the photo. From that time until he left home at the age of 18, it was a decade of great change in the history of Sang Island. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/11/07/5da0c2c9b6ad5aaebca8654dfef6c27c.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 0&quot; height=&quot;0&quot; data-src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/11/07/5da0c2c9b6ad5aaebca8654dfef6c27c.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;169421&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;A man draws characteristic tingatinga paintings and sells them to tourists/ICphoto&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;1964, Mulberry Island Revolution&lt;/h3>; &lt; p>;&lt;span>;In &quot;Lilac Eyes&quot;, I also turned to another dated black and white photo. Its caption read: European residential area - although the large Arab-style flat-roofed building in the photo looks There is nothing &quot;European&quot; about it. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The next day, I found out the specific location of the building. After arriving, I discovered that the building complex was built one after another by Arab merchants two to three centuries ago. In the 19th century, the British became more and more active on Sand Island. Until the end of the 19th century, Sand Island became a British protectorate and this area was officially occupied by the British. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In 1872, Richard Belden published two issues of his travel diary about Zan Island, &quot;Zanzibar: City, Island and Seaside&quot;, and many subsequent comments They all thought that he might want to use this to hint that European readers had begun to explore the source of the Nile in 1856, much earlier than Livingston. But surprisingly, the influence of this diary is more evident in his inadvertent description of the slave trading system on Sand Island, which reminds people that the slave trade in East Africa is no less rampant than in West Africa. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;As a meeting place for Arabs, Indians, Europeans and Africans, San Island is like a corridor connecting various rooms and halls, and at the same time provides sweet dates from the Arab region. Plantations, the tea fields of India, and the sugar industry of Southeast Asia&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #888888;&quot;>;(even the Americas)&lt;/span>;&lt;span>; provided labor. The most miserable ones were the male slaves who were selected as eunuchs by the Ottoman Empire. Because of the unhygienic conditions of castration, usually only one in ten could survive. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Belden mentioned: Investigations show that before 1897, when the British used both carrot and stick to ask the Sultan who was in power at that time to abolish slavery, two-thirds of the people on Sand Island were of the population belonged to the slave class. Still, Belden wrote, it was difficult for him to differentiate between black and brown people and what their ancestry was. &quot;Swahili, Persian&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #888888;&quot;>;(later developed into the &quot;Shiraz ethnic group&quot;)&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;, Arabia and India...all mixed together , I feel that the people here&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #888888;&quot;>;(referring to Sang Island)&lt;/span>;&lt;span>; are simply like a brand new race.&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;/span>; p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In 1890, the British officially took over Sand Island, but did not provide any effective and constructive mechanism for sustainable development. Land, wealth and power are still highly concentrated in Asia&lt;/span>;&lt;span style =&quot;color: #888888;&quot;>;(Including Arabia)&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;In the hands of the merchant class. At the same time, as was the practice in many other colonial powers, the rulers adopted a rigid management method in Sand Island by classifying all civilians according to their ethnicity and forcing them into a certain ethnic identity group. This made the tension inherent in the complex and subtle multi-racial mixture of Mulberry Island suddenly become tense. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Until the 1950s, a political storm against colonial rule swept across Africa. In 1963, Sand Island declared independence from the United Kingdom, the new Sudan succeeded to the throne, and British forces hurriedly withdrew from Sand Island. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Two days after leaving the &quot;European residential area&quot;, I came to the outskirts of Stone City and stayed at a B&amp;B recommended by a friend. &quot;Chat with the boss, you I&#39;ll be interested.&quot; My friend told me with a wink. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Wilson, the owner of the B&amp;B, is a Tanzanian, British-Indian, 70-year-old man. He was born and raised on Sand Island until he was 6 years old, and then moved to Sang Island with his parents. Dar es Salaam&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #888888;&quot;>;(Tanzania&#39;s largest city)&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;until the age of 20, then went to Edinburgh to attend university for four years. anthropology. After graduation, he changed three or four teaching jobs. &quot;I felt like I couldn&#39;t find a sense of belonging no matter how much I stayed in Europe,&quot; so he returned to East Africa. At first he wanted to take root on San Island again, but before he could settle down, he encountered the 1964 revolution. He had to take his Indian wife and three children and flee to Nairobi and Mombasa on the coast of Kenya, where he lived for more than ten years. Then we moved to the evergreen town of Mosh at the foot of Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania. It was not until 2005 that he returned to Sang Island and has settled there ever since. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;I found Wilson and sat with him among the coconut trees in the evening breeze, drinking ice-cold ginger ale. His eyes were as low as his voice, and like most people on Mulberry Island, it was difficult to tell where he came from just by looking at his appearance. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;“Although I am not a real Sandao person, when I talked about the revolution with many Sandao people, I found that their memories of it and their The definition of it - whether it is good or bad, good or bad, depends largely on who they consider their best friend, who they often share a pot of coffee with, or who they often invite into their home. Relatives and friends for dinner, in general, are extremely personal. For example, if your best friend is an Indian or a Shiraz, your evaluation of the revolution may be completely different. , because the Indians may be robbed and killed, but Shiraz can escape unscathed...&quot; Wilson said slowly. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;“But in fact, the revolution had already begun to take shape before 1964,” Wilson continued, “because it had only been more than half a century since slavery was abolished. , the old skeleton of society was basically shattered, and a reasonable new skeleton had not yet taken shape. It was full of loopholes. In addition, the British implemented many policies and regulations on clear class divisions. The Arabs still occupied a large number of people in San Island at that time. Absolutely outstanding status. So when the British withdrew, the undercurrent of conflict between the majority of landless African laborers and the minority of Arab landowners immediately transformed into a revolution.&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;span>;Wilson still remembers that in 1963, in Stone Town after independence, the iron gates of the police station were opened one after another, and all the imprisoned and beaten Africans poured into the streets and alleys, with eyes full of resentment and rage, as if they were gathering strength. , volcanic lava ready to erupt at any time. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;At 3 a.m. on January 12, 1964, the &quot;African-Shirazi Party&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #888888;&quot;>; (ASP, Afro-Shirazi Party&quot; member and Ugandan John Okello led 600-800 &quot;revolutionaries&quot; with extremely simple equipment to launch a surprise attack on the police headquarters and radio station. They had no guns and ammunition, only spears, machetes, iron rods and daggers. However, because of their surprise and desperate determination, they won comprehensively in just a few hours. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In this regard, the leader of the revolution, Oklo, always insisted that the actions of himself and other insurrectionists were &quot;pilgrimage acts&quot; in order to do justice for heaven and liberate the people who were persecuted.

At the seaside, I remembered that I and my friend Bosie once sat on the pier like this, &quot;watching the sea foaming with hands and feet and gnashing teeth.&quot; I remembered that on the same day, they paddled out to sea in a small boat and enjoyed that moment &quot;like &quot;Freedom without borders&quot;, watch how the Stone City gradually becomes smaller and smaller behind you, until &quot;it seems to have turned into a beautiful mirage&quot;. At that moment, they fantasized about escaping from the narrow and twisted streets of this small town and going to the distance to find opportunities as colorful as soap bubbles. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/11/07/3f125a9a5679eec53025d346922a999f.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 0&quot; height=&quot;0&quot; data-src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/11/07/3f125a9a5679eec53025d346922a999f.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;169425&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Picture of a boy diving near Stone City Pier/ICphoto&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Suddenly, the wind direction and ocean current seemed to be disturbed, and the boat started to stumble. Dauda became wary, but Bossi told him with a smile that this was just a sign that the northeast monsoon &quot;musim&quot; was blowing from the coast of India and Arabia to East Africa, while rowing the boat steadily steadily. When the sea seemed to have calmed down, Bosie explained why he could not leave his mother and daughter and go to England with Dauda, ​​and then come back to take care of them after he had established a foothold:&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style &quot;One day, these people who we have regarded and used as slaves for centuries will unite and cut the throats of those who enslaved them.

Who will care about us? They just They will tell us that this is Africa, their Africa, even though we have lived on this land for more years than they have.&quot; &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Bosi then handed the boat over to Dao As a challenge, he was asked to row the boat back to the shore and jump into the sea to swim back by himself. But the sea suddenly changed its face, and fierce hurricanes filled the entire ocean. &quot;I was struggling and beating the wooden paddle randomly,&quot; Daoda recalled, &quot;but when the storm finally calmed down, I looked around, but No more Bosie.&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;blockquote data-type=&quot;2&quot; data-url=&quot;&quot; data-author-name=&quot;&quot; data-content-utf8-length=&quot;132&quot; data-source-title=&quot;&quot;>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;>;&quot;I can&#39;t find him...

How did I finally get back to the shore after I tried everything possible... But Bosie, you missed the worst part. The moment I landed, I was beaten with sticks and stones.&quot;&lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;/blockquote>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>; Gurner set the two endpoints of the timeline in &quot;a certain November when the northeast monsoon is about to begin as usual and merchants are about to visit East Africa again, and the slave trade is about to begin. It will be between November, when the trade of Sang Island once again reached a climax, and January 12, when the revolution of Sang Island broke out in 1964. Drag the scale back and forth between these two points, discrete and aggregate, and start over and over again. . &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Later, Wilson took me to a beach 40 kilometers away from the B&amp;B, where he and his family had sat and waited for hundreds of hours under the scorching sun.

Their corpses will float on the sea together with dead branches, leaves, debris and garbage, showing the fatigue after the struggle, just like their wrinkled black skin and the broken hearts under the skin. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In addition, I wonder if the beach where Daoda frantically searched for Bosi and was beaten crazily was similar to this one? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In 2005, Gurna published &quot;Escape&quot;. Like almost all his novels, it is also about &quot;wanting to escape from a foreign land that cannot be escaped, and wanting to return to a foreign land that cannot be escaped.&quot; The story of immigrants who cannot return to their hometown. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In the same year, after years of struggling with his inner alter ego, Wilson finally plucked up the courage to return to Mulberry Island alone.

She only had general concepts about the slave trade, colonization and revolution, and did not have many specific feelings.

In short, I fell in love with her.&quot; , experiencing too much is not a good thing. Fortunately, the current generation of Sang Island has revived because of tourism.

I sent a message to my older cousin in the countryside early in the morning to ask how my relatives in my hometown were doing. My cousin said everything was fine. He has asked his family not to wander around outside unless they have nothing to do; and for his uncle who likes to hunt wild animals in the mountains, he has been strictly forbidden to go hunting in the mountains again. &quot;My uncle is quite honest,&quot; my cousin said. This makes me a little bit unbelievable. My uncle has always been fiery, but now he is willing to listen to his cousin. It seems that his dignity as the head of the family has already been established. My cousin is very busy. He leaves early and comes home late every day. He is the barefoot doctor in the village. He has to go to the monitoring point at the entrance of the village to measure the body temperature of outsiders every day. He has a heavy responsibility. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In such a special period, there are still outsiders coming, for no other reason than that my hometown is one of the best producing areas of Pu&#39;er tea in Yunnan, and March and April are the time to start picking spring tea. In previous years, before the spring tea was picked, many foreign merchants would come to the village early to reserve tea trees and tea farmers, so that the first crop of spring tea could be purchased, packaged, and transported as soon as it was roasted. Although there are not so many people coming this year, for some people, the temptation of spring tea is still greater than the virus. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/20/02/04/GKBNpqDRxP4vc2LgiCeJsYZbFjwjbkfejw1kFD3f.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;637&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/20/02/04/GKBNpqDRxP4vc2LgiCeJsYZbFjwjbkfejw1kFD3f.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;58412&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Spring in Pu&#39;er Tea Mountain. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern Weekend Information/Pictures)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Pu&#39;erbanna area belongs to the middle and low mountains and hilly areas, with interspersed large and small mountain basins and The valley flats pushed out by the Lancang River and its tributary water systems in the area are the main human settlements. Because it is located inland, surrounded by mountains, and has a high quiet wind rate, the cold lake effect is prone to occur in winter. This is especially noticeable when driving on a winding mountain road. It will become hot and cold as the terrain changes, and you will also see the cold lake effect in the winter. There is thick fog at the bottom of the basin and white clouds lingering in the mountains. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Xishuangbanna-Menghai-Huimin line is one of the main producing areas of Pu&#39;er tea. Mangzhi, Manzhuan, Mansa and Youle produce Pu&#39;er tea with excellent quality, and Yiwu tea is produced in Mansa. Menghai Huimin belongs to the six new tea mountains outside the Yangtze River (on the west bank of the Lancang River) - Nannuo, Hekai, Mengsong, Jingmai, Brown and Bada. The well-known Pu&#39;er tea brands &quot;Brown Mountain&quot; and &quot;Lao Banzhang&quot; are Produced in Brown Mountain, Menghai. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/20/02/04/xyqcOrWkZO0vTxXGzd88RbCkCplOnBnTIPhwKkFp.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;549&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/20/02/04/xyqcOrWkZO0vTxXGzd88RbCkCplOnBnTIPhwKkFp.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;58413&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Schematic diagram of the distribution of ancient Pu&#39;er tea mountains. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern Weekend Information/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Today, Pu&#39;er is known as the source of tea in the world and is a famous Pu&#39;er tea town. The good Pu&#39;er tea is in Lancang, and the Jingmai-Mangjing-Manghong area in Huimin Township is one of the important producing areas of Lancang good tea. The largest ancient tea garden of 10,000 acres among the twelve major tea mountains is here here. The ancient tea garden was planted in 696 AD and has a history of more than 1,300 years. There are also many semi-wild ancient tea trees in the area. The age of the trees is unknown, but according to locals, the oldest tea tree is 1,600 years old. These ancient tea trees still produce a certain amount of output every year and are a cash cow for local villagers. &lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;My hometown is in a village of the Blang ethnic group&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;In the spring of about three years ago, I went back to my hometown. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;My hometown is in Manghong, a village inhabited by the Bulang people. According to the tea mountain classification, it belongs to Jingmai Mountain. The Bulang people living here are good at planting, picking and making tea. Since ancient times, Tea is not only their daily necessities, but also an important commodity in exchange for supplies. Bags of Pu&#39;er tea carried on horseback are transported from Jingmai Mountain to Pu&#39;er Prefecture, Myanmar, and Thailand. Ma Gudao. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I rarely go back to my hometown. When I was a child, transportation was inconvenient—my hometown was hidden in the mountains, and the roads used to be difficult. To get from the village to the county seat, one had to walk over mountains and ridges for most of a day, catch a shuttle bus in the countryside, and then take a four- to five-hour ride. When I grew up, I had little time to go home because I studied and worked outside, let alone my hometown. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During the Spring Festival holiday that year, when they heard that I was coming back, my brother-in-law and cousin sent me a message asking me to go back and have a look. The Blang people celebrate the Water Splashing Festival in the Dai calendar year and don’t pay much attention to the Spring Festival, so I didn’t go back during the Spring Festival. Instead, I went back to my hometown with my brother and sister-in-law after Powu. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When I entered Mangjing from Huimin Township, I found that the road conditions were much better than a few years ago. This was all because of the Pu&#39;er tea. Anyone who sells tea knows that Pu&#39;er tea in this area is good. During the tea-picking season, merchants from all over the country come to collect tea. In order to facilitate the transportation of trucks, the government funded the construction of a road, which greatly improved the efficiency of logistics and transportation. The Blang people who grew tea became rich as a result, and the place became a well-known wealthy town. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is a checkpoint at the bridge that must be passed when entering Tea Mountain. Cars going out are basically ignored, but cars entering are checked very strictly. It is said to be to prevent someone from smuggling in Pu&#39;er tea of ​​average quality from other places and passing it off as local Pu&#39;er tea before selling it. Although they are in a remote area, people here have already had brand awareness and cherish their tea and brand very much, and do not allow anyone to ruin the reputation of their tea. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/20/02/04/VMXuGJSIQJZcZ6Q0kYQ3VdEXyn7U0RzVk326YbW7.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;540&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/20/02/04/VMXuGJSIQJZcZ6Q0kYQ3VdEXyn7U0RzVk326YbW7.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;58414&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Pu&#39;er scenery. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although the road conditions are completely different from those in the past, it still took four hours to reach Mang. It was already past 11 noon when we arrived at Hong Laozhai. The uncle came out from the stilted building and waved us into the house. The old house is a traditional Blang wooden house with a history of several decades. Last time I came back, my grandpa and grandma were still alive. They have passed away for a few years now, but the old house still maintains the layout and layout of the past: there is still a fire pit in the kitchen. Although the village has long started to use electricity and biogas, The fire pit still dances with flames day and night. The old people use the fire in this fire pit to bake their favorite cup of roasted tea. On winter nights, they sit around the fire pit to warm themselves up, drink tea, smoke hookahs and chat. The firepit is the soul of the home and cannot be thrown away at any time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although it is almost noon, only my uncle is at home. My cousin goes to school and has lunch at school and doesn&#39;t come back until the afternoon; my aunt goes to the mountains to pick tea and doesn&#39;t come home until the afternoon. Although the ancient tree tea has not yet reached the best time to pick, the first batch of platform tea has already begun to be picked. From this time until the end of April, it is the busiest time for the village. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Platform tea refers to Pu&#39;er tea cultivated in recent decades. Although the taste is not as mellow as accumulated through a long history, it is still a fine quality tea. No artificial fertilizer is applied, and the tea is made by the soil itself. It is nourished by the fallen leaves of ground forest trees, sunlight, rain and dew, and is also called ecological tea. A Taiwanese friend of mine once told me that Taiwan has very strict requirements for tea imports, and only completely ecological tea is allowed to be imported. The tea from my hometown is very popular among Taiwanese businessmen. A considerable part of the tea is bought by Taiwanese businessmen every year, which shows the superior quality. &lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Use Red Bull to relieve tea drunkenness&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;Although the layout of the old house has not changed, I still found two more things. One is a huge tea table - made by my uncle himself. Judging by its size, the tree must be quite old. With the entry of tea merchants from other places, a different way of life has been brought to the village, such as drinking tea. In the past, when drinking tea, you would take a copper kettle sitting on the fire pond to boil water, grab a handful of tea in a small earthenware pot, and roast it by the pond fire. When the water boiled, the tea would also be roasted and fragrant. When you pour some water into the jar, you will have a jar of fragrant tea, with a strong and wild fragrance. This cup of tea is very fragrant, but it is also very bitter. After the bitterness, it becomes sweet again. The power of tea is also very overbearing. First-time drinkers will become drunk if they are not careful, causing shortness of breath and palpitation, which is very similar to the symptoms of hypoglycemia. The local method is to grab handfuls of uncooked rice and chew it, which is said to be very effective. Canned roasted tea is easy to get drunk when you first drink it, but it can become addictive if you drink it for a long time. In the past, people in the village rarely went outside the mountains. Traffic was one reason, and they also thought the tea outside was weak. If you have to go out, you must bring your own pre-roasted tea leaves. After drinking the tea, no matter how things go, you must go back. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Nowadays, the old people also pay attention to the tea ceremony when drinking tea, including tea sea, tea wash, teapot, tea rules, aroma cup, host cup, tea tasting cup, etc., and there are many of them, paying attention to water temperature and water quality. , pay attention to making soup. One move after another, the ancient village is also absorbing new knowledge and changing with the changes of the times. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another change in the old house is the addition of a disinfection cabinet one person high. The Blang people themselves are a nation that loves cleanliness. As for my old house, although it is old, it is kept very neat and clean. The open-air palm (the local name for the terrace of the stilted building) is spotless, which makes people feel simple and friendly. Nowadays, the villagers are paying more and more attention to hygiene when making raw Pu&#39;er tea. Not only the houses, but also the roads in the village are still very clean, although they are still dirt roads. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After welcoming us into the old house, my uncle was not busy with anything else. He first invited us to drink tea - during the tea-picking season, almost everyone was busy in the tea mountains all day, and there was no concept of lunch at all. The tea is spring tea that has just been picked and roasted. Although it is not ancient tree tea, it is still top quality. The uncle poured boiling water into the teapot, closed the lid and let it simmer for five or six seconds, then poured the tea into the sea of ​​tea and distributed it to us. In order to see the color of tea, my uncle specially bought a small transparent glass cup. After pouring the tea, I saw that the tea soup is clear and fresh green in color. There is a fresh bitterness in the mouth. After two cups, the sweetness comes back, and the sweetness overflows in an instant. It fills the space between the lips and teeth, and expands in waves in the mouth, like a young girl who is shy and timid when she first met, but is enthusiastic and lively after getting to know her better - I think she must be a girl from the Brown ethnic group. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is said that drinking Shenpu shaving oil is very powerful. I arrived home at noon, and the breakfast in my stomach was almost digested, and my uncle was giving me a cup of tea on the left and right. Soon I had symptoms of hypoglycemia, and I slumped on the sofa and shouted for food. The uncle then suddenly realized it and patted his head and said, &quot;You are drunk with tea!&quot; Then slowly arrange the cooking. He first cooked the rice in the rice cooker, then set up a large pot on the fire pit, poured water in, pulled off a piece of bacon, chopped it into several pieces and threw it into the pot. While waiting for the water to boil, he went out like a gust of wind. After a while, my uncle came back like a gust of wind, brought back a pile of Red Bull and put it in front of me and said, drink some first, and you will not be drunk after drinking tea. I opened a can and drank it, and I felt better - it seems that Zuicha no longer chews uncooked rice, but drinks Red Bull instead. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;My uncle thrust Red Bull into my hand and ran out to get lunch. He grabbed a chicken from the chicken coop and killed it, then chopped it into pieces. When the water in the pot boiled, he poured them all into the pot, added seasoning salt, stirred a few times, covered the pot and continued to simmer. ; He also took out a large bowl of water pickled vegetables from the pickled vegetable jar, mixed some with soy sauce and chili for cold dressing, and chopped some into pieces and stir-fried with the turtle dove meat. At two o&#39;clock in the afternoon, we finally had a belated lunch - free-range chicken cooked with bacon, mixed with pickled vegetables, and stir-fried turtle doves with pickled vegetables. The food cooked over a firewood was particularly fragrant. I ate it with gusto and kept enough to eat. Two bowls of rice. &lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;Our ancient tree tea&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;After dinner, my eldest cousin happened to come back from get off work at the village clinic. He said hello to his uncle and said to me, Sister, do you want to see our tea garden? I said yes. The cousin and his uncle went downstairs to start the motorcycle. Manghong Village is built in the mountains. The roads in the village are not wide and the slopes are very undulating. It is not possible to ride bicycles. The daily means of transportation is motorcycles. Every household has at least one or two motorcycles. My cousin drove me along a thin yellow winding dirt road toward the mountains, followed by my brother-in-law and my brother. When we reached a slightly flat spot halfway up the mountain, my cousin stopped the motorcycle and led me to the roadside. He pointed to me not far down the mountain and said, &quot;Sister, look, that&#39;s our village!&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is early spring at 4:30 in the afternoon. The sun has turned slightly yellow, the sky is clear and the light is soft. Under the blue sky, stilted buildings with sloping roofs on all sides are scattered in an orderly manner, among the smoky bamboo canopies and banana trees. Under the cover, it undulates intermittently and extends to the mountains on the opposite side, showing a quiet rural style. My cousin said that this is his favorite place. He usually stops to take a look when he passes by the tea farm. When nothing happens, he will also come here to stand for a while. &quot;This is the village where I grew up. Our ancestors were born and buried here. There is no better place than here,&quot; the cousin said. We looked at it for a while, then my cousin waved me into the car and continued driving up. After turning a few more turns, my cousin stopped the car again and said, &quot;We&#39;re here.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/20/ 02/04/H3lU50w9mcJSHm6oFrojMJPnRP6mf3ZfyfGJVc6B.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/20/02/04/H3lU50w9mcJSHm6oFrojMJPnRP6 mf3ZfyfGJVc6B. jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;58415&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Mountain village. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is a hillside that looks like an undisturbed mountain forest, with thick and thin trees growing intricately. Trees, shrubs and some vines of varying heights. Between the tall trees and low shrubs, there are tea trees about 2 meters high. Among the dark green adult leaves, new green pointed leaves are piercing out like swords. They will be picked in a few days; Qiu The curved branches are covered with mottled layers of moss, as if they are the sedimented remains of time; the moss grows and withers season after season, and a thin layer of moss soil accumulates on the tea branches, becoming a place for parasitic plants to settle down. Here, as long as the Pu&#39;er tea trees grow to a certain age, there will be a parasitic plant called &quot;crab legs&quot;. The scientific name of crab legs is liquidambar mistletoe, which is very effective in treating rheumatic joint pain, lumbar muscle strain and acute cystitis. When tea leaves sprout, it is also the flowering and fruiting stage of crab legs. They grow in clusters among the tea branches, often causing the tea buds to fail to grow. Yunnan ancient tree Pu&#39;er tea is a large-leaf tree tea with tall plants. It is not easy to remove crab legs. Therefore, in the past, it was an annoying parasitic plant for tea farmers. Nowadays, crab legs are widely sought after, and the price is more expensive than ordinary Pu&#39;er tea, which can easily cost one thousand yuan per catty. Tea farmers often regard crab legs as a by-product of tea, which is another considerable income. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;My cousin proudly pointed to these tea trees and said: &quot;Sister, these are our treasures, ancient tea trees! Look at these tea trees with particularly strong branches. This one is more than 300 years old. , that one is 500 years old, and that one over there is the &quot;Tea Soul Tree&quot; of this tea field. The old people in the village said it is at least 800 years old. They said they were planted when the tea field first opened... These tea trees I They are all numbered, picked separately every year, and fried separately, which can be sold at a very good price.&quot; The so-called &quot;tea soul tree&quot; is the first tea tree planted in each tea field. How old is the tea garden? No matter how old it is, the tea garden has disappeared, but maybe the tree is still there... The tea soul tree is the soul of the tea garden. It transforms into a god and protects the tea garden. Therefore, a tea festival, called &quot;Tea Soul&quot;, is held every April. , not only does each family have to sacrifice their own tea soul tree, but the village also invites the Big Buddha and respected old people to preside over a grand ceremony to sacrifice the tea soul and call the tea god. In addition to these ancient tea trees, which are hailed as &quot;treasures&quot; by my cousin, the &quot;main force&quot; of this tea land is composed of tea trees that are about 200 years old. The scattered small tea trees are made from cuttings of the branches of ancient trees. They inherit It has the characteristics of the mother tea tree and has a consistent flavor. All it lacks is the experience of years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Sister, do you know the name of this mountain?&quot; I shook my head. &quot;This is Aileng Mountain, named after Pa Aileng!&quot; said my cousin proudly. Pa Aileng was an outstanding leader of the Blang tribe more than 1,800 years ago. Legend has it that in order to find an ideal place to live, he led the Blang tribe across mountains and rivers. After going through untold hardships, they finally found a place full of wild tea trees. , the soil here is fertile, the streams are gurgling, the vegetation is lush and lush, birds and animals roam here, and it is surrounded by mountains. It is an ideal place to build a village. So Pa Aileng led the tribe to settle here, and guided the tribe to domesticate tea trees and open tea gardens. This is the origin of Brown Village and tea gardens in Mangjing Manghong area. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“The water and soil in Lengshan are the best, and the tea in Lengshan is also the best tea!” My cousin said to me with an unquestionable and firm attitude. The Blang people believe that their leader Pa Aileng has found the best home and the most fertile land for them. They also believe in the principle of harmonious coexistence between man and nature. Therefore, except for necessary care, the Blang people never use artificial fertilization when growing tea. Needless to say the use of chemicals. The tea trees in the mountains suck the mist and dew, extract nutrients from the soil and dead leaves of weeds, and convert them into tea substances little by little, forming the characteristics of Jingmai Mountain tea, which is bitter and astringent, sweet and refreshing, and orange-yellow in color. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At this time, my cousin suddenly turned around and faced me, and said seriously: &quot;Sister, I always think that my ancestors left me such a precious tea land, I must protect it, no matter what The quality of tea trees and tea leaves must not be destroyed in my hands.&quot; I understood what my cousin meant. His main job is as a rural doctor, but he spends almost all his spare time on tea. The Brown people are originally a very clean people. When my cousin came here, he also brought in the professional habits of doctors. When his family picks and roasts tea, he insists on &quot;three things not falling to the ground&quot;, that is, picking the tea does not fall to the ground, withering the tea does not fall to the ground, and frying the tea does not fall to the ground. As for the final pressing of the tea cakes, he does it himself without any help. &quot;I will definitely continue to make tea well, and Pa Aileng will bless us.&quot; The cousin cast his eyes to the sky in the distance. There, the sun that was about to set was covered by a cloud, and the light came out from behind the cloud, giving the clouds a bright golden edge, like some kind of hint and approval from nature. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 29 Sep 2023 21:25:04 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[名字最有梗的小城，凭什么又翻红了？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257896]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-29 20:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 29 Sep 2023 20:25:04 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
