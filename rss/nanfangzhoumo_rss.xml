These things are very intensive. There are a lot of good things, but also a lot of bloody plots. Due to differences in customs, conflicting concepts, and disagreements in language, small things often become big problems, causing lovers to quarrel or even break up on bad terms. After the holidays, such complaints can be seen everywhere on social platforms. Reading these words, it seems that you can gain a lot just by eating melon. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Recently, I saw such a hotly debated incident: a pair of newlyweds visited each other&#39;s elderly. First, the elderly in the woman&#39;s family gave the man a red envelope of 2,000 yuan. Then he visited the man&#39;s house, and the man&#39;s parents gave the woman 2,600 yuan, which was slightly more, and seemed fine. Unexpectedly, the woman&#39;s brother and sister-in-law were obstructing the situation. They thought the man&#39;s gift was too little and demanded that the gift be doubled in accordance with local customs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The man thinks it is unreasonable and the woman thinks there is no empathy and consideration. There was a quarrel, the boyfriend and girlfriend blamed each other, each was disappointed, and finally broke up. There are a lot of tragicomedies like this available on the Internet, and there are many more bloody ones than this one. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The first level of analysis is very simple, it depends on who is causing trouble for no reason or making trouble unreasonably. The woman&#39;s family must obviously bear the responsibility - the brother and sister-in-law are not parents, but they interfere in the sister&#39;s private affairs on the grounds of customs, which is really too lenient. They are suspected of being greedy for money and profit. If such character is not maintained, there will be trouble. Many people congratulate the man for this, saving him a lot of trouble in the future. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The second level of analysis: young people fall in love and get married, there are all kinds of frictions, and the deepest collision is values. Values ​​cannot be consistent, and all kinds of things wrapped up in romantic love and personality congeniality will melt away sooner or later. When a man and a woman are in love, especially when discussing marriage, both parties may wish to be more brave and show their personal values. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If the concept is the same, there will be resonance. The prospective couple or husband and wife will appreciate and respect each other, and the relationship will develop in depth. This is the basis for the lasting and harmonious family relationship. If you have different views, you might as well communicate more and seek to get closer to each other. If the differences are too big, they will break up at best, which is a good thing in the long run. Under this post, many people came to express their congratulations - it was a good break for the two people who had deep differences in their views. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In a new family, the husband and wife are of the same mind and can avoid internal divisions. How do they avoid external disturbances, especially interference from their parents and families? This is the third level of analysis that we will focus on next. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Chinese family life, from discussing marriage to getting married, buying a house, and having and raising children, the elders have a great say, but most of them are stubborn. This is a distress faced by many Chinese families. On the one hand, young couples are dissatisfied with their elders. They think they have old-fashioned ideas, weird ideas, lack of skills, are picky and complain, and interfere indiscriminately. On the other hand, the elders also criticize the younger generation a lot, thinking that they are rude, heartless, turn their elbows outward, extravagant and wasteful, lazy and arrogant, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We are used to seeing such conflicts: every time we enter a new stage of life, new points of family conflict will appear. It ranges from despising small quarrels to falling apart at worst. Many people think that once the house purchase bill is passed, everything will be solved. However, the conflicts have not disappeared. As money is collected to buy a house and the elderly take care of their children, family conflicts become more intense. In comparison, disputes over red envelopes before marriage are so trivial that they can be ignored. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To resolve it, it is actually very simple. A new family is financially independent from the moment it is formed. Don’t be greedy for betrothal gifts and dowry, and don’t put a burden on your parents and family. It sounds incredible, but in fact, most of our parents&#39; generation got married with nothing. At that time, the income was still low, and most people worked hard just to have food and clothing. The burden of distress on contemporary young people only became a phenomenon in recent decades. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is not terrible for young people to be temporarily poor. As long as the family is harmonious inside and outside, and they work hard to make money after marriage, they can still thrive without &quot;family wealth&quot;. On the contrary, some new families are well off and receive support from their elders, but this also involves many conflicts. Husband and wife quarrel, in-laws are at odds, and there is wastage both internally and externally. Many people only see the benefits of betrothal gifts and dowry, but fail to see that forcibly &quot;fighting&quot; for betrothal gifts is actually a huge disaster for marriage. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The family is financially independent and it is difficult for parents to interfere. They didn’t pay, they didn’t pay attention, they couldn’t speak up, and they didn’t have the confidence. If money is given, they must be concerned and have the urge to dominate. Brothers and sisters, as stakeholders, will inevitably speak out. The brother and sister-in-law in the &quot;Red Envelope Incident&quot; are ugly, but they have the right to speak - who told the old man in the family to pay 2,000 yuan as soon as they met, and there will be more later. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many people understand this truth, but they cannot do it. Under contemporary reality, buying a house requires financial assistance, getting married needs to be organized, and betrothal gifts serve as a start-up fund for a new home and must not be given up. Especially after having children, most couples rely on their parents for help and are far from financially independent. In this case, what should we do? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is no better way but to accept reality. Young people who are about to get married are already adults. They cannot ask for money while shouting for independence and rejecting the opinions of their parents. This is inconsistent with interpersonal ethics and goes against human nature. Not only do you want financial benefits, but you also need to be free from restraint. The price must be conflicts in family relationships and weakening of family relationships. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many young people do not realize this and point the source of conflicts at the wrongdoings of their elders. In terms of specific matters, some right and wrong analysis may be possible, but as long as the &quot;investment interests&quot; are not equal, conflicts will inevitably continue. It is unreasonable to enjoy both large transfer payments from parents and to be &quot;independent&quot;. To resolve this conflict, there are only two ways to go: achieve financial independence as soon as possible and compensate your elders for their financial contributions; or accept the reality and compromise with them. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This kind of compromise is not a shame, but a price to pay. On the contrary, those who exploit their parents&#39; wealth in the name of independence, take advantage of both sides and ignore their parents&#39; inner pain, are the ones who really deserve to be despised. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is the author&#39;s personal opinion only and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot; https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style= &quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 22 Oct 2023 10:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[14万病例，2年PK，集采仿制药疗效和安全性怎么样？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259061]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-22 09:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/ image/23/10/21/a4c26c75fa.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/ 21/a4c26c75fa.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254816&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;For a true and comprehensive understanding of the safety and effectiveness of selected generic drugs in centralized procurement In response to the epidemic, the National Medical Insurance Administration organized medical institutions to conduct real-world research on the clinical efficacy and safety of the second and third batches of generic drugs selected for national mass procurement. Visual China/Picture&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;After two years of &quot;big PK&quot;, a study covering 29 medical institutions in 16 provinces across the country and about 140,000 real cases showed that &quot; The clinical efficacy and safety of generic drugs selected through centralized procurement are equivalent to those of original drugs.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Since 2018, 8 batches of state-organized drug procurement have been carried out across the country, involving 333 kinds of drugs, with a total use of more than 216 billion tablets/tubes. A large number of selected generic drugs have entered the clinical frontline, reducing the burden on patients and increasing the substitution rate of generic drugs. Hundreds of millions of patients have access to high-quality and affordable drugs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;There are also some medical staff and patients who still lack confidence in the clinical efficacy and safety of generic drugs, especially whether the quality of the selected generic drugs can be guaranteed after the price reduction. There are concerns, and some people have suggested that consistency evaluation does not equal clinical equivalence.&quot; On the morning of October 17, 2023, Zhang Lan, Director of the Pharmacy Department of Xuanwu Hospital of Capital Medical University (hereinafter referred to as Xuanwu Hospital), spoke at a press conference of the National Medical Insurance Administration Said above. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In order to truly and comprehensively understand the safety and effectiveness of generic drugs selected through centralized procurement, starting from 2021, the National Medical Insurance Administration will organize Xuanwu Hospital and other medical institutions to target the second , conducted real-world research on the clinical efficacy and safety of three batches of generic drugs selected for national mass procurement. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Previously, Xuanwu Hospital and more than 20 medical institutions in Beijing conducted real-world research on the 14 selected drugs in the first batch of centralized procurement, and the results showed that the selected drugs There is no statistical difference in clinical effectiveness and safety between generic drugs and original drugs (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;For details, please see Southern Weekend&#39;s report on November 7, 2021 &quot;&lt; a href=&quot;http://www.infzm.com/content/217325&quot;>;100 million people benefited, and the three-year medical insurance negotiation burden was reduced by nearly 170 billion yuan&lt;/a>;》&lt;/span>;). &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Zhang Lan is the leader of the research team for this 140,000 real case study. It is reported that the research and evaluation targets 23 varieties in six major therapeutic areas including anti-infection, anti-tumor, metabolism and endocrinology, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular, neuropsychiatric, and digestive systems, including selected generic drugs from 38 brands. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Zhang Lan revealed that in the future, we will continue to conduct real-world evaluations of subsequent batches of selected generic drugs to provide evidence-based support for clinical use. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;There is no statistical difference in clinical efficacy and safety&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Real-world research reflects the actual diagnosis and treatment process and changes in patients&#39; health status under real conditions. More objectively evaluate the safety and effectiveness of medication in real environments.&quot; Bian Xiaolan, Director of the Pharmacy Department of Ruijin Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University, introduced. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The results of this study show that five oral anti-infective drugs, including cefdinir, cefaclor, azithromycin, linezolid and moxifloxacin, are similar to There is no statistical difference in clinical efficacy and safety between pharmaceutical and original drugs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Among the anti-tumor drugs, five generic drugs: Tegio, azacitidine, abiraterone, letrozole, and anastrozole, are comparable to the original drugs The clinical efficacy and safety are equivalent. The therapeutic response rate of generic capecitabine is higher than that of the original drug (50% vs 30%), and the difference is statistically significant. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Among the drugs for metabolic diseases, metformin (hypoglycemic drug), vildagliptin (hypoglycemic drug), and febuxostat (uric acid-lowering drug) are the best choices There is no statistical difference in clinical efficacy and safety between generic drugs and original drugs. There are 4 brands of generic drugs of glimepiride (hypoglycemic drugs) participating in the evaluation. Among them, the efficacy and safety of 3 brands of generic drugs are equivalent to the original drugs. Another brand of generic drugs is not only safe. It is equivalent to the original drug, and in the evaluation index of hypoglycemic effect, the compliance rate of glycosylated hemoglobin &lt;7% is higher than that of the original drug (61.7% vs 42%). &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;A total of 3 types of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular drugs were included in the evaluation, including 2 anticoagulants (apixaban, ticagrelor) and 1 antihypertensive drug medicine (valsartan). The results showed that there was no statistical difference in clinical efficacy and safety between the generic drugs of the above three drugs and the original drugs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;There are also 2 psychotropic drugs and 1 digestive system treatment drug. There is no statistical difference in clinical efficacy and safety between the generic drug group and the original drug. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The target population of real-world evaluation is patients who actually use clinical drugs. The sample size can reach hundreds to tens of thousands. The research indicators are direct efficacy and safety. Clinical indicators, study duration, long-term follow-up of subjects as needed. Compared with real-world studies, drug consistency evaluation focuses on verifying the equivalence of generic drugs to original drugs in terms of design, biological absorption and metabolism, and the target population is healthy subjects. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Research indicators mainly include pharmaceutical equivalence and bioequivalence. Only when pharmaceutical equivalence and bioequivalence are met can generic drugs Through consistency evaluation.&quot; Bian Xiaolan explained. Pharmaceutical equivalence requires that generic drugs have the same active ingredients, effective dosage, route of administration, dosage form, etc. as the original drug, and must meet drug quality standards. Bioequivalence requires that the absorption and metabolism of generic drug preparations in the body are consistent with those of the original drug. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;We conduct real-world research to further verify and support the efficacy of drugs through different scenarios and methods. It is a process in which real-world data generates real-world evidence. It’s not that the quality and efficacy consistency evaluation work standards are not high.” Bian Xiaolan emphasized that through real-world research, the research team has verified the efficacy and safety of the drugs selected through centralized procurement through the generic drug consistency evaluation from actual diagnosis and treatment scenarios. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Six drugs have been notified of centralized procurement in the past five years&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Passing the consistency evaluation is not a &quot;talisman&quot; or &quot;pass&quot; for drug quality. After a drug passes the consistency evaluation, the regulatory authorities will still conduct full-chain quality supervision on the production, circulation, and use of the drug. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Drug supervision is not only the supervision of results, but also the supervision of the process. For example, the regulatory authorities require: ensure that the production process is consistent with the approved process, and ensure that each batch of sales The quality of sub-standard drugs is consistent with the declared samples to ensure continuous research on marketed drugs and timely reporting of adverse reactions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;For example, in the production process, from the selection of raw materials to the production process, there is a complete quality control and supervision system, even if it is only the supplier of pharmaceutical raw materials. Replacements need to be reported to the drug regulatory department to ensure the stability of drug quality.&quot; Zhang Lan gave an example. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;At the same time, the national drug administration and medical insurance departments have established a quality supervision coordination mechanism for the selected products, and implemented full-coverage supervision and inspection of the selected companies. The State Food and Drug Administration deploys special supervision work every year to achieve &quot;three full coverages&quot; of enterprise supervision and inspection of selected products through national centralized procurement, product sampling inspection, and adverse drug reaction monitoring. Currently, inspections involve nearly 600 drug manufacturers, covering all 333 selected drugs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;A total of 1,387 selected products were selected in eight batches of national-organized centralized procurement. In the past five years, a total of 6 products have been notified by the drug regulatory authorities as having quality risks, including 2 domestically produced imitation products. Pharmaceuticals, 4 imported drugs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;For the above-mentioned selected products that have quality risks, the medical insurance department will cooperate with the drug regulatory department to deal with them, including disqualification of the selected products, inclusion in the &#39;violation list&#39;, and restrictions on the products involved. Enterprises shall participate in centralized procurement organized by the state within a certain period of time. For products with quality risks, regardless of domestic or foreign-funded enterprises, the medical insurance department will work with the drug regulatory department to deal with them resolutely, treat them equally, and continue to send the signal of &#39;zero tolerance&#39; for quality problems.&quot; National Medical Insurance Zhang Ming, leader of the bureau’s price recruitment expert group, introduced. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On October 13, as the Joint Procurement Office of State-Organized Drugs issued an announcement on its official website, the ninth batch of centralized procurement of state-organized drugs also pressed the start button. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 22 Oct 2023 09:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[浪里人生丨记者手记]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259027]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-22 08:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/11/3KlQURn8IAiq75Cy8HWajQ9l7ECu7pLrtLJOg8Ig.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/3KlQURn8IAiq75Cy8HWajQ9l7ECu7pL rtLJOg8Ig. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253648&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On September 23, 2023, at Qingdao Olympic Sailing Center, Xu Jingkun sailed a sailboat out to sea&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern People Weekly reporter Liang Chen/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Details of relevant reports See &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.infzm.com/content/258546&quot;>;One-armed captain Xu Jingkun and his super racing boat丨cover character&lt;/a>;&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;October 2023 When Xu Jingkun sailed the boat to the &quot;Coffee Road&quot; racing village on the 14th, I was packing the wardrobe at home. Autumn has entered in the north, and it is said that there will be rain and the temperature will be lower next week. The life of ordinary people is like this, with three meals and four seasons, coming over and over again. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This year marks the 30th anniversary of the &quot;Coffee Road&quot; two-man non-stop transatlantic sailing race, and for the first time a single-man return race has been added. Xu Jingkun will first set off from France with his partner, British captain Mike Godin, around the west side of Africa and the northeastern side of South America to reach Central America, and then return to Europe alone. In just over a month, it crossed the equatorial windless zone twice and sailed more than 10,000 nautical miles (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 毷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;nearly 20,000 kilometers&lt;/span>;). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Looking at the video Xu Jingkun posted at sea, it was also very cold in France, and he also put on a thick windproof jacket on the boat. I remembered that during the interview he complained more than once that &quot;the sea water in France is so cold&quot; and &quot;the water in the Atlantic Ocean is too cold!&quot; I couldn&#39;t help but laugh. The cold and the warm are intertwined, but after all, heroes are very different from us ordinary people. I was busy looking for Wearing a sweater and long trousers, he can overcome the limitations of his body, join the wind and waves, and travel through the seasons. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When I met him in Qingdao in September, he had just flown back from France the day before. I asked him if he had jet lag, and he said no. &quot;My body is used to it!&quot; Years of ocean sailing have made him accustomed to it. It’s not just the time difference, it’s also the change of seasons. In 2024, he will participate in the world&#39;s most difficult &quot;Vendée Globe&quot; sailing race, and will experience nine winters and summers on the route. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the autumn of 2021, Xu Jingkun decided to buy an imoca60 super racing boat to participate in the 2024 Vendée Single Non-Stop Round the World Yacht Race. The four-year Vendée Globe is the &quot;Everest&quot; of competitive sailing. To win a ticket to the 2024 Vendée Globe, he must first participate in the designated qualifying event. In the 2022 season, he completed the &quot;Rum Road&quot; single-handed transatlantic sailing race, gained valuable points in the Vendée Globe qualifying event, and became one of the first official candidates for the 10th Vendée Globe in 2024. If the &quot;Coffee Road&quot; and the subsequent solo return race can be successfully completed, Xu Jingkun is expected to seize the ticket to the 2024 Vendée Globe. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When Xu Jingkun was 12 years old, his left forearm was amputated in an accident. He was nicknamed the &quot;one-armed captain&quot;. He controlled the sailboat with one hand and completed the circumnavigation of the China Sea in a single-handed boat. transatlantic, and circumnavigation, among other feats. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2015, Xu Jingkun began to participate in professional boat racing. There is no preferential treatment for the disabled in this field. All participants are &quot;capable&quot; in sailing competition - won the 2020 &quot;Vendée Globe&quot; The seventh-placed captain, Damian Seguin, finished the race wearing a pirate uniform, with a pirate hook in his raised left hand. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From the first moment I saw Xu Jingkun, his ease and ease made me forget that his residual arm was a problem. He said that sailing has completely changed him and turned him into a more and more comfortable person. I think what really healed him was his &quot;completeness&quot;. He has completely overcome the physical and mental damage caused by the accident. His Although his left hand is incomplete, years of training have given him and inspired him with super physical abilities, allowing him to do his job, control his life, achieve his goals, and walk steadily on the water. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It will take Xu Jingkun two days to drive the race boat from the port to the famous French port of Le Havre. Starting from October 20, the &quot;Coffee Road&quot; Double Transatlantic Race Village in Le Havre It will be open to the public, and the boats will set sail on the 29th to begin the 2023 transatlantic racing voyage. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Offshore sailing is a magical sport. On the one hand, the racing teams and captains have to withstand the pressure of budget and speed. On the other hand, even the fastest transatlantic record takes seven or eight days. , and the round-the-world voyage lasts for several months. Sailors in the deep sea will always feel a kind of loneliness that lasts for a long time and the sun and the moon are endless. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When I wrote this short article, Xu Jingkun had just posted a circle of friends. He was still on the way to Le Havre. He used the fisheye camera of the drone to film himself and the racing boat. &quot;Haha, this is my only toy at sea!&quot; His wife Ajiu left him a message, urging him not to be playful, &quot;If you don&#39;t come here, the coffee road will be sailing!&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt; /p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 22 Oct 2023 08:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[被烈犬咬伤募捐200万争议：医院称未开证明，轻松筹称家属自估金额]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259059]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-21 22:33:21&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;In the community where the incident occurred, slogans about civilized dog breeding can be seen everywhere.

His condition is &quot;much better than when he was admitted to the hospital.&quot; Smoother.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When a single request for help exceeds 500,000 yuan, EasyCho stipulates that &quot;a written certificate from a medical institution with relevant qualifications should be submitted.&quot; However, the above-mentioned hospital personnel said that the hospital &quot;did not issue any relevant expense certificates.&quot; The girl was transferred to the hospital at around 23:00 on the 16th. As of 8:00 on the 20th, the child had paid a total of 110,000 yuan in advance through the manual window. What had happened The cost is about 30,000 yuan, and there are currently no outstanding fees. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporters contacted the girl’s mother and case lawyer Zhou Zhaocheng many times, but as of press time, had not received any response from them. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 19, after raising 2 million yuan, this help link was closed. Qingsongchou told Southern Weekend reporters that this was shut down after the platform communicated with Ms. Deng and obtained the other party&#39;s consent. Hanhan&#39;s current expenses in the hospital were advanced by the property management, and neighbors around her also made donations. The nearly 2 million yuan in aid &quot;repaid Not moving”. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the controversy, it was reported on the Internet that in addition to raising money easily, the Hanhan family also raised millions of dollars on the Shuidichi platform. On October 19, Shuidichou’s public relations staff confirmed to Southern Weekend reporters that Hanhan’s family had not set up a help link on Shuidichou. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Neighbors donated money, property management fees were advanced&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;On the afternoon of October 20, Southern Weekend reporters came to the Evergrande Xichen Oasis Community involved. Many residents said that this property can only be considered &quot;medium&quot; in Chongzhou City (Chengdu City). The entire property is divided into three phases and there is no villa area. The second phase of the building where Hanhan&#39;s family lives is unfinished, and the houses will not be handed over until the end of 2022. There are still owners who have not taken over the property. Lianjia APP shows that the average transaction price of second-hand houses in this community in the past six months is 6,594 yuan/square meter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It was dinner time, and there were not many pedestrians. Some residents were walking with their Labrador dogs, and there were also children running and playing. If it weren&#39;t for the slogans about civilized dog-raising hanging up everywhere in the community, it would be difficult for outsiders to think of the tragedy of a Rottweiler biting a girl five days ago. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;The publicity board of the building where Hanhan&#39;s family lives.

Photo by Southern Weekend reporter Gao Yichen&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After being guided by residents, Southern Weekend reporters came to the building where Han Han’s family lives, but no one answered the door on the corresponding floor. The publicity board of the building has a leaflet of &quot;Be a Civilized Dog Keeper&quot;, as well as a recent notice from the property management to all owners: &quot;In view of civilized pet keeping management, the property management center now clearly implements the inspection requirements of all employees... Key reminders in the community are that if any unscrupulous dog owners are found, If a dog or stray animal is on a leash, the patrol post will catch it as soon as possible and send it away from the community.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A resident in the same unit recalled to a Southern Weekend reporter that on the morning of the incident, most parents On the way to take my children to school, &quot;there are very few people in the community.&quot; She is still afraid these days. If her son wants to go downstairs to play, she will subconsciously ask him to &quot;wait a moment.&quot; The resident said that he did not know Hanhan&#39;s family, and his community group did not organize donations, but these days everyone was intensely discussing the girl being bitten. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Luo Xia (pseudonym), another mother in the same unit, remembers that before her community group received the easy fundraising link sent by Ms. Deng, some neighbors spontaneously donated money in the group. Donations of varying amounts were forwarded by the group owner, and many people donated. Luo Xia saw someone donating 500 yuan, but she donated less than 100 yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The chat records provided by Li Ping show that the aforementioned vegetable sellers made three donations to Hanhan, namely 3566 yuan, 266 yuan, and 1416 yuan. On October 17, after the first two transactions were accepted, Ms. Deng replied &quot;Thank you.&quot; Li Ping said that these days, some residents who are not in the group also want to ask them to transfer donations, and some privately ask Ms. Deng’s WeChat account to donate to her. &quot;We are all parents, and we cannot bear to see our children suffer.&quot; Li Ping explained why she donated money. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;Screenshots of group donations provided by community residents.

Photo provided by the interviewee&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Luo Xia was thinking that the compensation would not be paid soon, so the neighbors first raised some money for Hanhan&#39;s family to deal with the emergency, &quot;Like us ordinary people, it is not easy to buy a house. You still have a mortgage, how much money can you have?&quot; Afterwards, she asked the group owner how much money they had raised in total. The group owner did not tell her the specific amount. Luo Xia estimated that if she gave it to the other party, &quot;it might be 20,000 to 30,000.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for the easy way to raise donations, attorney Zhou Zhaocheng said in an interview with the media on October 20 that the couple dressed simply, did not wear brand-name clothes or jewelry, and lived in an ordinary environment. The two of them are currently unemployed and devote themselves to taking care of their daughter in the hospital. They have no financial resources for the time being. Although follow-up rights protection will be launched one after another, as far as the child&#39;s treatment is concerned, the compensation payment is &quot;obviously too slow.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the same day, a reporter from Southern Weekend asked the housekeeper of the building as the owner. The other party said that the girl&#39;s treatment fee was currently paid by the property owner. &quot;After all, we will not be held responsible for what happened in the community.&quot; shirkable&quot;. The housekeeper said he did not know the specific amount of advance payment. Southern Weekend reporter learned from EasyCho that the current amount of advance payment from the property owner is around 100,000 yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;Family members estimate the amount themselves&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;As of October 20, Hanhan&#39;s family uploaded the West China Hospital&#39;s advance payment receipt, illness certificate, etc. in the easy mutual aid link. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the certificate of illness, in addition to multiple traumas caused by dog ​​bites, Hanhan also suffered from contusion and laceration of the right kidney, sepsis, embolism of the lower branch of the right renal artery, contusion of the liver, and fracture of the ribs. In addition, according to public information, Hanhan&#39;s family&#39;s annual income is between 30,000 and 100,000 yuan. They have a house, a car worth less than 100,000 yuan (not sold) and liabilities of more than 200,000 yuan. Hanhan does not have medical insurance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; EasyCho explained to Southern Weekend reporters that Hanhan’s fundraising project was initiated by her family on the 18th and passed the AI ​​review. After the link was widely forwarded and the amount of donations increased rapidly, the platform conducted a manual review. The review process required the fundraising staff to confirm the family&#39;s financial situation with Hanhan&#39;s family members and attorneys, and also communicate with the hospital, subdistrict office, and public security department. Verify authenticity from the side. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;(The girl) has no medical insurance or new rural cooperative medical insurance, and has not had time to buy it. The mother of the child seems to have just been working for a month and has no income. The father only earns several thousand yuan a month.

A written certificate from a qualified medical institution will be reviewed and published by the platform before the fundraising link is initiated. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Why did EasyChou open a help link for Hanhan with a target of 2 million yuan without obtaining relevant certificates? The public relations staff of EasyChou explained that considering that the child&#39;s condition was &quot;really very critical&quot; at the time, &quot;the family will communicate with the hospital.&quot; Afterwards, the family estimated such an amount, and we launched a (mutual aid fundraising link) for her.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The public relations officer also said that if the child uses this donation of nearly 2 million yuan for subsequent treatment, the platform will review the hospital&#39;s receipts and testing documents based on Hanhan&#39;s treatment. &quot;We will make a settlement at each stage, and then we will transfer the money to the hospital.&quot; He said that what can be guaranteed is that &quot;this money will definitely not reach the hands of the family.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If a user who donated money wants a refund, there is also a corresponding channel for Easy Raising. After the donor applies and provides relevant certificates, the previous funds can be returned via the original route. EasyCho stated that if the final expenditure is less than 2 million yuan, the money can be donated to other charity foundations. It will be decided by the family as to which charity foundation to donate to and which groups to help. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A former staff member who left EasyChou in 2021 analyzed to Southern Weekend reporters that the fundraising platform will also hope to gain higher visibility and better reputation through social public events, but Hanhan’s The fundraising link and fundraising speed are &quot;really too fast&quot;: &quot;We have helped many people before, spending more than one million yuan, but this is the first time we have encountered such serious cases of dog bites.&quot;&lt; /p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 21 Oct 2023 22:55:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[柳大华实名举报棋协领导：有无操纵比赛胜负与奖金分配应彻查丨快评]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259037]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-21 22:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;On the evening of October 17, 2023, chess player Liu Dahua posted a video on his personal social media to &quot;report&quot; the country under his real name Guo Liping, deputy director of the Chess and Card Sports Management Center of the General Administration of Sport, has attracted public attention. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu Dahua accused Guo Liping, &quot;For a long time, she has protected and connived at the evil forces in the chess world, and openly used computer software and modern technological means to manipulate and arrange the outcome and prize distribution of various large-scale domestic competitions.&quot; And It was said that Guo Liping &quot;did not investigate this shocking scandal, but instead suppressed and retaliated in every possible way against the athletes and coaches who came forward to expose the scandal&quot; and demanded &quot;a thorough investigation and serious handling to return a clear and just sky to the Chinese chess community.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 18, the staff of the Chess and Card Sports Management Center stated that they had been informed of the matter and reported it to their leaders. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu Dahua did not produce any evidence in the &quot;report&quot;. How long is &quot;a long time&quot;? Who are the &quot;evil forces in the chess world&quot;? Which one is the “shocking scandal” referring to? Who did Guo Liping protect, condone, and retaliate against? What kind of games are &quot;manipulating the outcome of the game and arranging the distribution of prize money&quot;? Therefore, Liu Dahua should submit more concrete evidence to support the accusation, otherwise the &quot;scum&quot; and other statements are purely personal attacks, and the accusation is suspected of slander and defamation, and he should also bear corresponding legal liability. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for &quot;using computer software and modern technological means to manipulate the game&quot;, it is the focus of Liu Dahua&#39;s report video. The outside world also thinks based on this that this report may be related to this year&#39;s &quot;recording scandal&quot; in the chess world. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since Kasparov lost to &quot;Deep Blue&quot; in 1997, all chess sports have had to face the challenges of computer software and artificial intelligence. Compared with Go, which can only be played by deep learning AI, Chinese chess has been conquered by computer CPUs in the PC era at the beginning of this century. &quot;Being unable to play on a computer&quot; is not an issue in the Chinese chess community. &quot;Software cheating&quot; is a topic that has been discussed for many years. Once chess players use computer software, almost no one can beat the &quot;human-machine combination&quot; opponent. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The use of technological means to manipulate the outcome of games and arrange the distribution of bonuses mentioned by Liu Dahua is technically possible. If in the past, manipulation of the game required smoothing and management, today, if you want to determine the outcome by default, you only need to use technological means, such as hiding smart communication devices into the arena, and &quot;human-machine integration&quot; with the background in real time, so you will naturally be invincible. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For many years, it has become a common practice for Chinese chess players to accuse each other of &quot;software cheating&quot;. Even many new chess players will be suspected of using software to cheat just because their winning rate is too high, and this has even developed into mutual suspicion. , a point where everyone is in danger. Chess player Wang Tianyi has repeatedly encountered similar accusations, and even encountered a &quot;demonstration with a jammer&quot; by his opponent Zheng Weitong during a match. Therefore, as soon as Liu Dahua&#39;s report video came out, many chess enthusiasts believed that this incident was a follow-up to the &quot;recording scandal&quot; three months ago. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Recording Gate&quot; incident occurred in mid-July 2023. The recording content is mainly a conversation between chess players Wang Yuefei and Hao Jichao. The two of them mentioned &quot;buying and selling chess&quot; in slang, and also hinted that chess Hand Wang Tianyi &quot;instrument cheating&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the incident fermented, chess player Dang Fei expressed his position online, taking the attitude of &quot;demanding a thorough investigation&quot; and always &quot;connoting&quot; Wang Tianyi on social media. During this period, there were also episodes of &quot;Dang Fei issued a lawyer&#39;s letter&quot; and &quot;Wang Tianyi responded live on the air&quot;. The incident has not been resolved to this day. Dang Fei is Liu Dahua&#39;s disciple who broke into the house. On October 18, he also released a real-name report video, saying that he had 90 minutes of recordings and had forwarded the evidence to the relevant departments. It can be seen that the aftermath of the &quot;recording scandal&quot; is rippling, and this &quot;master-disciple report&quot; has escalated the controversy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Recording Gate&quot; has been fermenting for three months, from &quot;instrument cheating&quot; and &quot;buying and selling chess&quot; in the recording gate to Liu Dahua&#39;s accusation of &quot;computer software manipulating the game and arranging the outcome of the game.&quot; and bonus distribution.&quot; Whether these accusations are true or false accusations should be investigated by the Discipline Inspection and Supervision Department of the General Administration of Sports and even the public security organs, rather than remaining in a public opinion war. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This reporting incident is enough to make people reflect on the current positioning of the ancient sport of Chinese chess. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As early as 2005, the &quot;Zhao Xinxin buying incident&quot; made &quot;buying and selling chess&quot; a shadow hanging over the Chinese chess world. The &quot;recording scandal&quot; is not the first one this year. Audio and video evidence of &quot;chess player Zhao Guorong collecting money from students and leading people to compete in team competitions to win the title of master&quot; also made it to the Internet in August, and there has been no investigation conclusion yet. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;computer software&quot; mentioned in Liu Dahua&#39;s report cannot help but make people reflect. In view of the fact that &quot;buying, selling, winning and losing, accepting bribes for profit&quot; has become easier in the information age, then the value of winning and losing has nothing to do with competition. What is the significance of? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since the global optimal solution to Chinese chess has been conquered by computer computing power (just like the solution to the Rubik&#39;s Cube has long been conquered by human brain computing power), it might as well gradually evolve into a spontaneously developed intelligence among the people. For entertainment activities, competitions should be organized by private organizations, which should be responsible for their own profits and losses, and set their own rules, instead of being reduced to today&#39;s &quot;human-computer game&quot;, which wastes public funds and hurts the enthusiasm of chess fans. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;With the development of Chinese chess to this day, if it is really going to be reduced from &quot;a cultural treasure of the Chinese nation&quot; to a tool for &quot;trading wins and losses, taking bribes and making profits&quot;, then who is the murderer? Relevant departments should investigate this matter in depth and consider ways to reform the management of chess and card sports. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 21 Oct 2023 22:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[排队在各地“想你”系路牌打卡合影，这凭啥火的？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258625]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-21 21:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;When I saw it, it felt very similar to what I wanted to say in my heart.

In addition to being used by scenic spots, cultural and creative parks, etc. to attract visitors, these street signs are also used by some merchants with keen business sense to regard them as traffic tools to attract the public to stop. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In front of a bakery near the intersection of Zhaolin Street and Shitou Road Street in Daoli District, Harbin, there is a street sign saying &quot;I miss you very much in Harbin&quot;.

Others, such as some milk tea shops, coffee shops, snack shops, etc., have also erected various street signs to attract people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In addition, some famous landmarks and road signs are also sought after. For example, the Drum Tower street sign in Beijing has become one of the most popular street signs at the moment. In order to hit the Gulou street sign, some young people will even take a hard seat on the train for more than ten hours and then wait in line for two hours to complete the photo. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The popularity of street signs has also become a kind of social currency.

In addition, City walks have emerged in various places, and young people have started walking in the city, taking photos while walking. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;These trips naturally bring traffic to scenic spots, Internet celebrity spots, streets and alleys, and this traffic is reflected on social platforms, that is, many people take photos of street signs. In other ways, the check-in goal of &quot;I have been here before&quot; was completed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;From a historical perspective, street signs are essentially one of the forms of plaques. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In terms of cultural origins, plaques are an indispensable decoration in Chinese classical architecture. Whether it is a building, a platform, a pavilion, a pavilion, a pavilion, a pavilion, a hall, or a pavilion, plaques are in harmony with the building. They are an essential part of the building and are equivalent to the eyes of the building. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Taking a plaque and showing the inscription on the plaque is the fastest way to convey that you have visited this place or like this place. In front of many historic sites, towers or mountain peaks, whether it is a stone tablet, a foyer plaque or a poem written in calligraphy, the public likes to take photos. This in itself is a self-evident awareness. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Although today&#39;s street signs have changed in form and text compared to inscriptions, they actually have the same expression effect and can achieve a &quot; The functions of &quot;I checked in here&quot; and &quot;Say this sentence for me&quot; are a modern &quot;mouth substitute&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Moreover, compared with the rigidity of plaques on ancient buildings, today’s street signs can be humorous and can also be customized with various golden sentences, making them more personalized and youthful in expression. , can better interact with the mood of young people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/HhTRsdQmapKYKUNw4xVmj1bOhwm7cdeOQKEFiyqy.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;810&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/HhTRsdQmapKYKUNw4xVmj1bOhwm7cdeOQKEFiyqy.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;254425&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（IC photo/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; >;&lt;strong>;Are street signs so popular that they annoy people? &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;It is worth noting that the large-scale imitation and transplantation of similar street signs in various places has also brought criticism to the popular street signs. Recently, the street signs installed by Zhejiang University, Central Academy of Fine Arts and other universities have been criticized by some freshmen. Some people said directly: &quot;I don&#39;t even want to take a look at the Internet celebrity aura that comes to my face.&quot; Others said euphemistically: &quot;It feels a bit out of class.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Moreover, with the continuous increase of Internet celebrity street signs, there are also problems with illegal construction of street signs in some areas. Since July this year, Shanghai, Ningbo, Shiyan, Leshan and other places have removed such illegal &quot;Internet celebrity street signs&quot; placed on the roadside. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Relevant staff from the Zoning and Place Names Office of Ningbo Municipal Civil Affairs Bureau of Zhejiang Province explained, &quot;Road name plates are a type of place name signs, which are national legal landmarks. It is also a kind of public facility and should be set up by the civil affairs department.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Captain He of the Comprehensive Law Enforcement Squadron of the Pujiang County Comprehensive Administrative Law Enforcement Bureau in Jinhua, Zhejiang Province said, &quot;These The size and shape are actually relatively close to, or basically the same as, the standard place name signs set up by the government’s civil affairs department. The Internet celebrity street signs we manage are mainly for those set up along the street, and are actually a type of place name sign. &lt;/ p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;It can be seen that if you just follow the trend without thinking and set up some Internet celebrity street signs in places such as universities and libraries, some of the styles do not match, and it may be wrong. Causing disgust. Secondly, if the road signs are installed by merchants themselves and named randomly, it is easy to mislead people to go the wrong way or find the wrong place, causing people to lose time and money. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In this regard, Professor Gu, associate professor at Southeast University School of Law and public member of the Nanjing Urban Governance Committee, analyzed, “Internet celebrity street signs that hinder public order require relevant departments to promptly Intervention and regulation. However, it is also the goal of urban management to explore more and better cultural and creative solutions and Internet celebrity designs that can attract traffic and bring economic benefits while taking into account social responsibilities.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In general, street signs that extend the traffic function can be viewed dialectically from multiple angles and optimize strategies. The presentation of street signs must, on the one hand, ensure the identification function of public facilities, and on the other hand, provide appropriate space for the presentation of &quot;Internet celebrity street signs&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;While diverting traffic without interfering with public travel, this may be the development direction of characteristic road signs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 21 Oct 2023 21:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[硬核军训是怎么炼成的]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258988]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-21 20:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/18/A72oqQdD8BybPWTNg0BalhXWNoO5Mh57DFsDOpHt.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;612&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/A72oqQdD8BybPWTNg0BalhXWNoO5Mh 57DFsDOpHt. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254443&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Guangxi Guilin University of Electronic Science and Technology 2023 freshmen military training demonstration&lt;span style=&quot;color: # aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Special Warfare Mode&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The alarm sounded, orange-red and white smoke staggered and dispersed, and the air was filled with sulfur smell. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;More than forty students wearing camouflage uniforms and holding model Type 95 rifles approached in batches from one side of the green field to the other. There are scattered fire rings made of cardboard boxes and obstacles covered with camouflage nets along the way. The advancers either suddenly fell down or rolled out of their guns to avoid the explosions flying from the opposite side. Every time he stopped neatly, he was still in the shooting posture, with the muzzle of the gun pointed at the &quot;enemy camp&quot; ahead. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this military training exercise, students acted as a special operations force of our country. Their mission at the moment is to board a strange border island to rescue the hostages held by terrorists. More than 20 people, including &quot;hostages&quot; and &quot;robbers,&quot; were stationed under a camouflage awning on the other side of the playground. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;While advancing, we encountered stubborn resistance from the enemy. Many special forces &quot;fell&quot; and 7 &quot;sacrificed&quot;. Medical soldiers wearing white armbands rushed into the smoke-filled battlefield in groups of four. The two in front held guns for cover, and the two behind carried the wounded onto stretchers for treatment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The robbers were equipped with more heavy firearms: a mortar and two rocket launchers. We only have one rocket launcher. When the battle was lost, the special forces issued a request for support. Subsequently, simulated armored vehicles and tanks manufactured at a 1:1 ratio were driven onto the playground one after another. With the support of solid barriers and mobile turrets, the special forces team successfully reached the enemy camp. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Rescue soldiers and tanks have surrounded the enemy camp layer by layer, but the robbers are still guarding the &quot;door&quot;. Our demolitions use directional blasts to blow up the stronghold. There was a loud noise and white light shot out. The hostages were finally rescued after rescue soldiers rushed in and engaged in close combat with the robbers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is the military training meeting of Guilin Institute of Aerospace Industry (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;hereinafter referred to as &quot;Guihang&quot;&lt;/span>;) on September 27 The finale of the parade ceremony: the performance of the special warfare phalanx. Long after the performance ended, the applause and cheers of more than 5,000 freshmen in military training echoed throughout the playground. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The flame of excitement burned in Instructor Zhang. As the instructor of the special operations phalanx and the planner of the special operations performance, he also participated in the &quot;rescue operation&quot; and played the role of a special forces commander. Instructor Zhang’s skin was dark, his face was covered with sweat, and the gray and green colors of his camouflage makeup blurred together. He spoke breathlessly and in an uplifting tone. When he asked questions to the team members who were resting on the floor, he always received resounding answers and hearty laughter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Instructor Zhang is a militia member of the Guilin Garrison Area. After retiring from the armed police, he worked as a special warfare training instructor at a military training summer camp in Guangdong for four years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Different from conventional military training, special warfare training imitates the training of our country&#39;s special forces, selecting the most elite &quot;soldiers&quot; and adding subjects such as tactical movements, weapon operation, and wilderness survival. It is more intense and difficult. Instructor Zhang firmly believes that &quot;this kind of education method can truly temper students&#39; bodies and spirits.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The educational concept of &quot;barbaring one&#39;s body&quot; is sometimes accompanied by more voices of incomprehension. Once upon a time, there was a young man who came from Zhejiang for training, and he always practiced gun-holding movements perfunctorily. In order to urge him, Instructor Zhang couldn&#39;t help but said some harsh words: &quot;If you can&#39;t hold a gun well, then you don&#39;t need to eat.&quot; As a result, his parents scolded him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I&#39;m not denying him food, I just want him to experience setbacks and growth. Training is not the purpose. The important thing is to let students learn the valuable qualities of self-improvement, self-reliance, and self-confidence.&quot; Instructor Zhang remembered that when he first joined the army At that time, because I was not holding the gun properly, I was ordered to do the same thing by the squad leader for a whole morning. After that, he practiced diligently and became a model in the army&#39;s tactical training. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, in Guihang, Instructor Zhang rarely has the trouble of not being understood - the special team members are tougher than he imagined. Among Guihang&#39;s 5,000 freshmen participating in the training, more than 80 students from various military training camps passed the selection of height and physical fitness, and finally completed the study and performance of tactics, shooting and other projects. Even if you wear protective gear, rolling, climbing and other actions will inevitably cause arm and leg abrasions. But most people are enthusiastic. Instructor Zhang recalled that a classmate from the Sixth Battalion of the special operations team had a serious muscle strain. After a day of rest, his symptoms improved and he immediately returned to the team for training. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The real battlefield will not leave opportunities to lax soldiers. All the training of the special operations team are highly simulated battlefields. The human ladder construction training is to restore the scene of three people fighting together. Gun training simulates a quick response to an enemy attack. &quot;The simulated gun is relatively heavy, and the students are naughty and occasionally deliberately distort the movement of the gun.&quot; Instructor Zhang will seriously teach him: &quot;When encountering a real attack, the gun must be drawn within 1 second or even 0.1 seconds. The movements must be crisp and clear, and the eyes must be clean.&quot; You have to be keen, otherwise you will be a lamb waiting to be slaughtered.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;About 10% of the people who initially signed up to join the special forces team dropped out. &quot;Special warfare training requires very high physical fitness. Carrying a 1:1 scale simulated rifle that is almost as heavy as a real gun (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 毷体, 毷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;95 (The weight of the rifle is 3.25kg&lt;/span>;) to complete tactical actions, some people are not physically fit enough to do the standard.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Only the special operations team has the opportunity to come into contact with the simulated gun, and students from other companies will start to purely Yu signed up to join the special training team out of curiosity about firearms. Instructor Zhang does not encourage such people to stay because &quot;they are not interested in the special training itself. They just want to take pictures with tanks and armored vehicles. They cannot accept the hard training and cannot keep up with the pace.&quot; In his opinion, only the students themselves are active With participation and cooperation, hard-core training and realistic performances will not be in name only. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/csZ7etnCAfokT74q9Qot5lJZJSRMp9TKLcAYgcqG.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/csZ7etnCAfokT74q9Qot5lJZJSRMp9TKLcAYgcqG.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254439&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Special warfare phalanx display during Guihang military training exhibition&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(provided by interviewee/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p >; &lt;h4>;National Defense Enthusiasts&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;As night falls, the mountains surrounding the campus gradually disappear, the singing of the Mid-Autumn Festival Gala rehearsal is endless, and the lake is full of students running around it. It’s an ordinary Tuesday night at the Huajiang Campus of Guilin University of Electronic Science and Technology (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;hereinafter referred to as &quot;Guidian&quot;&lt;/span>;). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Through the lively playground and stage, in the quiet square, more than 20 members of the Patriotic National Defense Education Association are conducting their daily training. This is a club composed of enthusiasts of national defense knowledge and military training in Guidian. They often participate in the school&#39;s national defense education activities and usually maintain at least two hours of tactical training a week. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to wearing camouflage uniforms, the team members also wore simulated guns, tactical helmets, marching bags, protective gear, and military boots, just like troops going out to perform missions. They are all students participating in this year&#39;s military training for freshmen. At this time, two weeks have passed since the end of the Guidian military training camp. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since its establishment in 2019, the Patriotic National Defense Education Association has selected students who are determined to participate in tactical training for a long time from each new military training class and regularly conducted daily training on infantry combat skills. The core personnel who have undergone long-term training will assist the instructors in completing the tactical training for new students in the second year of military training. In the 2023 Guidian freshmen military training, 150 students from the tactical company were assigned to provide guidance to 30 members of the 21st and 22nd level associations. The person in charge pointed out that this kind of small class teaching can improve the efficiency of training. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many of the participants in the association have the idea of ​​joining the military or the police. Lin Yu, who served as the gunner of the anti-tank team in this military training, applied for the police academy as her first choice in the college entrance examination. Joining the tactical team satisfied her childhood desire to operate firearms. Shen Hong serves as an industrial infantryman responsible for demining. His father was a soldier. Shen Hong&#39;s favorite TV drama character is Li Yunlong. He believes that this tactical training has given him a lot of knowledge and strengthened his ambition to join the army. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Fend off the enemy from the front.&quot; As the squad leader issued the order, the members of the seven-person platoon quickly completed squatting, turning over, and crawling from the stance of marching with guns, with their guns pointing forward. After hearing &quot;defend the enemy from the rear&quot;, the members who were running forward suddenly turned around, slid sideways and lay down, with their guns pointed at the rear. This is an individual soldier action exercise, the association’s most basic training program. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Huang Yilong, chairman and founder of the association and a preparatory class for the children of border guards in 2019, is supervising the training of members. He reminded the squad leader to take the members to a venue without glass ballast to prevent scratches caused by the huge friction with the ground. When Lin Yu fulfilled the command to &quot;lie down while running&quot;, his movements were not coherent enough. Huang Yilonglue jokingly urged the squad leader to correct Lin Yu&#39;s actions. He explained to a reporter from Southern People Weekly, &quot;She slowed down first and then lay down. It was too slow. Now she is dead in the actual combat state. You can see that other people slid down directly from the high speed. She almost slowed down.&quot; If I go on to 0, I will still be afraid.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When talking about the essentials and operational significance of various military actions, Huang Yilong always speaks very quickly. He can talk about the &quot;three-point running and shooting position change&quot; in team operations and the obstacle breaking training of the engineering chemical defense team like an encyclopedia. Huang Yilong grew up in a military compound and liked to study various military tactics on his own. He started participating in military clubs in high school. This hobby continued into college and became an ambition. &quot;After graduation, I will either join the army or plunge into research in the military field. I will not be so comfortable doing other jobs.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The plan for the 2023 Guidian military training and the tactical confrontation performance of the red and blue squares is Huang Yilong and the leaders of the training units jointly completed the planning. &quot;Our first tactical display in 2021 will be more conservative, with only infantry and pure attackers. This year, with armored vehicles, blasting tubes and other equipment, we can display more complex tactics, and we have designed offensive and defensive confrontation, engineer barbed wire breaking obstacles and other links.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to Huang Yilong, the military training exercises in Guihang, a ten-minute drive from Guidian, also made reference to this tactical confrontation model. &quot;Guihang&#39;s Military Enthusiasts Association is a fraternal association with us and shares some promotional materials and equipment resources. At the beginning of their association&#39;s establishment, we helped them organize some training. This year, we also seconded guns to Guihang&#39;s freshmen military training. Give it to them.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for the next step in the development of the association, Huang Yilong hopes to form a mutual aid community with more military hobby societies in local universities to exchange more experiences in tactical training. In addition, he plans to enrich tactical training projects. &quot;In the beginning we only had simple training on advancing, kneeling and sliding, and fending off enemies. Later we went up the mountain and carried out infiltration and counter-infiltration operations in the forest. There may be new development directions in the future.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt; img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/VpLyIkjRdB9o98kmFtnycQIKGic5OP5m1r3hIaR3.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;540&quot; data-src=&quot; //images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/VpLyIkjRdB9o98kmFtnycQIKGic5OP5m1r3hIaR3.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254442&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Guidian Patriotic National Defense Education Association conducts woodland infiltration and counter-infiltration training near the school&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(provided by interviewee/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4 >;Resources and Culture&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;It takes about 50 minutes to drive from Guilin North Railway Station in the direction of Yaoshan Scenic Area to reach Guihang and Guidian. They are only one stop apart on the route of bus number 13. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Both schools are surrounded by mountains, covering vast areas, far away from the bustling city, and seem to be specially designed for Qing Dynasty. Unless it is a holiday, there are few vehicles passing by on the mountain roads surrounding the school. In the nearby Yaoshan Scenic Area, there are dense forests and gentle slopes. The surrounding environment provides the school with a suitable place for field training and simulated jungle combat. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Guihang chose Yaoshan for training. The person in charge of the school&#39;s armed forces department explained, &quot;With more than 5,000 people training, safety is the first priority. In addition, we must also meet everyone&#39;s needs for exercise, so we walked to the mountains where there are few cars.&quot; The members of the special operations team used trees and grass to For cover, they wore gas masks and simulated woodland infiltration, jungle manhunts and other activities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The supply of military training equipment benefits from cooperation between universities and between universities and military institutions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Guidian’s imitation armored vehicles and rocket launchers are all seconded from Guilin Military Expo Park. Staff of the Military Expo Park revealed that Guidian’s national flag guard team will also come to the Military Expo Park to perform. The simulated guns and gas masks were loaned from the Army Special Warfare College. You Jiangjiao, chief of the Comprehensive Section of the Guidian Armed Forces Department, said that over three days, nearly 10,000 military training students took turns to experience shooting simulated guns. Guidian, the current deputy minister of the Armed Forces, once worked at the Army Special Warfare Academy. In order for the performance to go smoothly, he took the initiative to help the students borrow 55 marching bags from a unit in Qifeng Town. Some of the simulated mortars, tanks, firearms and other equipment used in Guihang&#39;s military training are provided by the school&#39;s military associations, and some are seconded from the Guilin Garrison District. Guidian, Guilin and other universities will also lend some equipment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In recent years, real gun and live ammunition shooting in military training in colleges and universities has gradually been replaced by simulated gun shooting. You Jiangjiao pointed out, &quot;Shooting with real guns is too dangerous. The real guns borrowed by the school are mainly disassembled for students to learn.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Teachers from the armed forces departments of the two schools believe that the school&#39;s emphasis on military training Investing more resources will help enhance students’ national defense awareness and promote military recruitment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As part of national defense education, military training is also a window for ordinary students to understand the life of the army. The person in charge of the Guihang Armed Forces Department once conducted a post-training survey on the students of the school. He found that the previous military training, which had a single form and lacked equipment support, made many students question the meaning of military training: &quot;If the military training showed students all about going forward and standing in military postures, they would also find military life boring like this. It is difficult to yearn for the army. Military training adds activities such as tactical training and enriches the form to more comprehensively reflect the real life in the military camp and allow students to understand the specific needs of national defense. This can inspire their enthusiasm and belief in joining the army.&quot;&lt;/p >; &lt;p>;Li Ming, a retired soldier from the Guilin Garrison District, has a military dream that was cultivated by the military training experience he witnessed in his childhood. His parents are teachers at Guilin Forestry School. Since elementary school, Li Ming has often observed the military training of this technical secondary school after school. At that time, the use of firearms accounted for a large proportion of military training courses, and Li Ming, who was watching from the sidelines, was always clamoring to play with firearms. When Li Ming was in junior high school, instructor Chen often came to this school to train students. He often played with Li Ming, who was unwilling to do homework, and taught him a lot of military knowledge. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One day, Instructor Chen accidentally broke his arm while demonstrating a certain movement. Other instructors quickly rushed forward to check the wound and sent Instructor Chen to the infirmary. This scene deeply inspired Li Ming: &quot;I am an only child born in the 1990s. I can only cry alone when I am injured. When the instructor is injured, his comrades are a solid backing. We study with peace of mind, and the soldiers are also our backing, protecting everyone and the children. The safety of my home.&quot; Li Ming determined to be a soldier who can become the backing of the country. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Today, he is also an instructor at Guihang Military Training. He hopes that the seeds that instructor Chen once planted in his heart will also be planted in the hearts of Guihang students. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Is hard-core military training suitable for more people?&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The resources of the special operations training model cannot benefit everyone who participates in military training. Among the more than 5,000 freshmen participating in the training at Guihang, except for more than 80 members of the special operations team, other students rarely have the opportunity to come into contact with simulated firearms. Courses on square formations such as split formation and prisoner boxing are still based on formation training. For safety reasons, those who drive armored vehicles and tanks are instructors who have obtained driver&#39;s licenses. Students can only take photos with these models or sit on them to experience them. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A classmate of the split company felt a little regretful that he did not have the courage to sign up for the special operations company: &quot;Although it is more difficult, I can also learn a lot of military skills and experience more military life. It&#39;s a pity that I I wear glasses. During the selection, the instructor said that the movements may break the glasses, and those wearing glasses cannot participate. In addition, there are height requirements, and those with martial arts and dance foundations are given priority. I don’t seem to be good enough.&quot;&lt;/p >; &lt;p>;Wang Zhipeng, a lecturer in the Military Teaching and Research Office of Xi&#39;an Jiaotong University, said that the emergence of special training models in military training is to meet the military training needs of different types of students: &quot;In recent years, colleges and universities have expanded their enrollment, and the number of participants has continued to increase. The physical fitness and adaptability of students have There are differences, and some high-intensity training may not be suitable for all students. Similar activities are also held in the national student military training camps organized by the Ministry of Education and the National Defense Mobilization Department of the Central Military Commission to provide students with good physical fitness and deep national defense sentiments. A platform for growth, experience and advancement.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to the threshold of student quality, special warfare training itself also has higher requirements for resources such as venues and equipment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The biggest headache for instructor Zhang, who is in charge of Guihang’s special training, is the lack of softer training venues. During special training and movements such as rolling and lying down, the hard cement floor will aggravate the students&#39; scratches. However, the plastic badminton court on Guihang South Campus cannot be used because it is close to classrooms for other grades. The playground with a 400-meter track in the North Campus needs to be shared by 7 camps. Instructor Zhang sometimes felt a little crowded, so he had to take the team to a corner of the playground for training. They had only rehearsed the full tactical display with ample space once. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Guidian’s way of solving the problem is to make full use of the roads on campus. You Jiangjiao pointed out, &quot;By clearing the electric vehicles parked on the road to one side, the area of ​​the training venue can be increased, and the separated teams can train here.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Universities such as Guihang and Guidian, It has a military-industrial nature, and it is more convenient to communicate with the local military region and borrow resources such as simulated firearms during military training. But in general colleges and universities, it is relatively difficult to borrow. Xi&#39;an Jiaotong University&#39;s approach is for the school to purchase its own military training teaching aids. The special training team always has more than 40 model guns, and other students can only get 2-3 guns per company on average. The average price of a model gun is a few hundred yuan. If it is to ensure that every student participating in the training has one like a special training team, it will also be a big expense for a school that provides military training for five to six thousand freshmen. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Zhipeng believes that the implementation of the compulsory content required by the &quot;Military Course Syllabus for General Colleges and Universities&quot; (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;such as light weapons shooting, battlefield medical treatment First aid, etc.&lt;/span>;), so that more ordinary students can have the experience of hard-core military training, it is necessary to &quot;increase resource investment, strengthen policy supply, and create a professional team of national defense education teachers. At the same time, teaching must incorporate the latest technologies VR, The introduction of informatization and intelligent equipment such as drones into military training will enhance the four flavors of military training, namely fun, military flavor, war flavor and technological flavor, and improve student participation and educational effect.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(At the request of the interviewee, Lin Yu, Shen Hong, and Li Ming are all pseudonyms in the article.)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt; /p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 21 Oct 2023 20:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[国常会审议通过《人体器官捐献和移植条例（修订草案）》]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259053]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-21 19:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Li Qiang presided over the executive meeting of the State Council&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;State Council&#39;s Notice on Cancellation and Adjustment of a Group of Decision on Fine Matters&quot; and &quot;Regulations on Human Organ Donation and Transplantation (Revised Draft)&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Premier Li Qiang chaired an executive meeting of the State Council on October 20 to review and adopt the &quot;State Council&#39;s Notice on Cancellation and Adjustment of a Group of Fine Matters&quot; Decision&quot; and &quot;Human Organ Donation and Transplantation Regulations (Revised Draft)&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The meeting pointed out that strictly regulating penalties and fine standards is an important measure to optimize the business environment and reduce operating costs. It is necessary to continue to reduce fines and reduce fines that violate legal authority, do not meet the needs of economic and social development, and can be managed in other ways. It is necessary to strictly regulate the discretionary power of administrative penalties, intensify efforts to rectify arbitrary fines, improve collaborative governance and joint punishment mechanisms, seriously investigate and punish behaviors such as the administration of fines and excessive fines, increase exposure to the society, and prevent all types of benefits. The effect of corporate policies is weakened or offset. Efforts should be made to strengthen interim and ex-post supervision, improve supervision methods, standardize supervision procedures, improve supervision efficiency, and effectively strengthen supervision in key areas such as production safety, life and health, and product quality, so as to provide strong support for promoting high-quality development. According to the meeting&#39;s deliberations, it is planned to cancel and adjust 33 fines in administrative regulations and departmental rules as a package. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The meeting emphasized that human organ donation and transplantation are acts of great love and charity in the world, related to the lives and health of the people, bioethics and social justice, and are an important symbol of the development of national medicine and the progress of social civilization. We must put people and life first, further regulate human organ donation and transplantation, ensure the quality of medical care, protect human health, and safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of citizens. It is necessary to take this revision of the regulations as an opportunity to strengthen legal protection, establish a full-process traceability and supervision mechanism, strengthen the construction of the organ donation work system, strengthen the ethical review of organ procurement, crack down on and investigate organ-related crimes in accordance with the law, and better protect the organ donation and The transplantation industry is developing healthily. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Other matters were also considered at the meeting. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 21 Oct 2023 19:55:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[以色列进攻加沙有多难？丨军事]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258963]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-21 18:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/18/xR91tMnZtrplBiQuvhY8Iwfs2YUaEY5bS0FgMwuo.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/xR91tMnZtrplBiQuvhY8Iwfs2YUa ​​EY5bS0FgMwuo. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254430&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On October 13, 2023, Israeli troops assembled on the Israeli side of the Gaza border &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Xinhua News Agency/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Recently, due to the escalation of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict caused by attacks launched by Hamas, Israel was attacked after Quickly mobilize and assemble a large number of troops, preparing to enter the Gaza Strip from the ground to completely eliminate the armed forces of the Hamas organization. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although the Israeli army has an absolute strength advantage and there is no suspense about victory or defeat, the Israeli soldiers will undoubtedly face a very complex battlefield. Militants who have been lying in wait for a long time are waiting for the Israeli army to enter. They have a large number of Tunnel bunkers were available and large quantities of anti-tank weapons and explosives were prepared. What’s even more troublesome is that not only do a large number of local civilians in the Gaza Strip have nowhere to go, Hamas forces also control many hostages taken from Israel, which makes offensive operations more inconvenient. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 14, 2023 local time, Israel gave residents in northern Gaza 24 hours to leave their homes and go to the south to escape the fighting. Therefore, there are constant rumors from the outside that Israel will soon launch a ground attack on Gaza. However, in my personal judgment, Israel&#39;s full-scale offensive will not begin anytime soon. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Due to the sudden incident, even though Israel&#39;s mobilization efficiency was very high and 300,000 reservists were recalled within one day, the reorganization, equipment distribution and familiarization of these troops, as well as pre-war mobilization, still took time. In addition, fire sweep before ground troops enter is also necessary. According to local news, in addition to dispatching its air force to attack hundreds of targets every day, Israel&#39;s artillery is also constantly shelling targets in northern Gaza at half-minute intervals. The purpose of these attacks is not only to destroy Hamas targets that have been discovered, but also as a psychological warfare method to constantly tire and disturb the enemy, forcing local civilians to flee as soon as possible. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This type of attack is a typical pre-war softening method for urban warfare, just like the use of shock bombs in anti-terrorism operations, leaving the opponent confused and unable to accurately judge the time to launch a real ground attack. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to tactical strikes, Israel has also implemented a siege policy on the Gaza Strip, cutting off water, electricity, and communications. This was not only intended to punish the local population but was also intended to affect Hamas&#39;s military communications. Since Hamas is an organization that is inseparable from civilians and military, its communications rely heavily on civilian networks and mobile phone base stations. If its power and network communications are cut off, it will not only be difficult for Hamas armed personnel to charge their electronic devices, but they will also need to add additional communications. Means to ensure smooth communication during wartime. The delay in entering after cutting off the water and power grid is actually to wait for Hamas to activate the backup communication means to conduct subsequent electronic reconnaissance, and to master the frequency band, communication habits and encryption methods of Hamas&#39;s backup communication, so that the Israeli military can launch attacks on the ground Then interfere or locate the communicator. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Furthermore, the newly mobilized troops and active units still need to conduct some necessary pre-war drills to become familiar with the intended battlefield environment and continuously improve the combat plan. Intelligence and reconnaissance units also need to conduct necessary pre-war reconnaissance to further grasp the real-time battlefield situation and enemy conditions. Whether it is technical reconnaissance, human reconnaissance or fire reconnaissance, it requires a lot of time and resources to complete. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Based on the above technical laws of war, Israel&#39;s full-scale attack on the Gaza Strip will require at least 2-6 weeks of pre-war preparation time. All current information about launching a ground attack is likely to be interference signals released by Israel. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After Israel launched its ground attack, it certainly faced many challenges, of which the outside world was most concerned about Hamas’s tunnel warfare methods. There may be an entire city&#39;s worth of tunnels and bunkers beneath the surface of Gaza, where Hamas can constantly evade Israeli ground fire. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But Gaza is actually not as strong as the city fortresses such as Bahmut and Mariupol in the Russia-Ukraine conflict. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Modern war machines are extremely destructive. Only modern industrialized reinforced concrete structures can withstand artillery attacks to a certain extent. Ukraine is an industrialized country, and most of its buildings are built with modern construction techniques and can easily be transformed into fortresses that can withstand artillery fire. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Most of the houses in the Gaza Strip are brick-concrete structures. Judging from the experience of blasting operations, brick-concrete structures are actually not very resistant to attacks by modern weapons. Large-caliber machine guns can even penetrate brick-concrete structures directly. For the exterior wall of a structural house, the fragments of the internal wall that explode while penetrating can even become anti-personnel shotguns. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, using wall-breaking bombs for blasting operations can easily open new attack channels on the opponent&#39;s wall. The main reason why urban street fighting is terrifying is that the defender can concentrate its firepower in the killing traps set by itself. However, if the attacker can bypass the killing traps, the traps will be useless. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for the issue of tunnels, although tunnels can hide the traces of Hamas on weekdays, there are actually many means of detection and destruction of tunnels during wartime. To deal with tunnels in plain areas, you generally only need to control the ground first, then detect them through technical means, and destroy them with weapons such as cloud bombs. At the same time, you can also use cement trucks to grout all the detected entrances and exits. If Hamas cannot gain a foothold on the ground and simply takes shelter in the tunnels, the Israeli army can easily destroy the tunnels. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Israel also has a capability that has not been seen in past wars, which is the world&#39;s first-class design and manufacturing capabilities of cruise missiles, drones and unmanned combat robots. Israel was the first country to use cruise missiles in war, and it is still the leader in the research and development of this technology. Even the U.S. military is purchasing Israeli-made cruise missiles to equip the army. Although Israel suffered heavy losses from Hamas drone attacks in previous attacks, in future operations, Israel&#39;s loitering bombs, drones and combat robots may attack in full. Even though Hamas has learned to use drones to deal with tanks, it does not have the corresponding anti-drone and loitering missile capabilities. The ground attack will inevitably be accompanied by the reconnaissance and surveillance of a large number of drones and the attack of loitering missiles. This is Russia and Ukraine. A capability that neither Russia nor Ukraine has on the battlefield. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In any case, Israel’s ground attack will be a joint attack of sea, air, ground and unmanned systems, which will undoubtedly give the outside world an opportunity to peek into new tactics for urban combat in future wars. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 21 Oct 2023 18:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[王培军：我所喜看的九部电影]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258957]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-21 17:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/20/Tl3bAwVIiWDjuln3lIIiPIfXFnKQo1vmQZXWH3OU.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1200&quot; height=&quot;675&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/20/Tl3bAwVIiWDjuln3lIIiPIfXFnKQo1v mQZXWH3OU. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254699&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Stills from the movie &quot;A Chinese Ghost Story&quot;. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(data map/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The last verse of &quot;Vajra Prajnaparamita Sutra&quot; says: &quot;All conditioned dharma, such as A dream is like a bubble. It is like dew or lightning. It should be viewed as such.&quot; Thirty-three years ago, when I was in college, I went to Mingjiao Temple with my classmates and bought this Diamond Sutra. I didn&#39;t realize at all at that time that the names of the movies that modern people love to watch were already mentioned here, and the profound meaning contained in the word &quot;movie&quot; was also revealed in these few sentences. Life is like a movie, and movies are literally &quot;like dreams, illusions, bubbles, shadows, like dew and lightning.&quot; Movies are just the shadow of life, and life is just a shadow like a movie. Most people like to watch movies, just like children who like to watch the shadows of everything and are endlessly curious about them. I can&#39;t count how many movies I&#39;ve watched, but I know the movies I watch many times because I like them. Even if you watch a good movie, if you watch it too much and you are overly familiar with it, you will definitely get bored and will not want to watch it again. This is just like delicious food, if you do not exercise restraint and eat too much to its upper limit, you will definitely get bored. , sometimes even vomiting after eating, vowing never to eat again. This is the opposite of things. Everything in the world has this dialectic. But how many times do you watch it before you get bored? The number of times you get bored is obviously a measure that can be used to detect the quality of a movie and how much you like it. The following nine movies are ones that I have watched many times but have grown tired of and do not want to watch again in the near future - of course because they are good to watch. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/20/90EHlvLkm3J5RX3wvb61RptQMwpAiWtefgYq1Zz1.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/20/90EHlvLkm3J5RX3wvb61RptQMwpAiWtefgYq1Zz1.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254703&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;A Chinese Ghost Story&quot; 》Part 1 (1987). The first time I watched &quot;A Chinese Ghost Story&quot; was the third part, which was in the mid-1990s. There is only one scene that I remember now, that is, Shifang&#39;s master grew his own long ears to cover his eyes because he couldn&#39;t beat the grandma. I watched it again later, and all I remember is still this incident. I watched the first part six or seven times, maybe more. &quot;A Chinese Ghost Story&quot; is based on the &quot;Nie Xiaoqian&quot; chapter of &quot;Strange Stories from a Chinese Studio&quot;. This is a well-known story that many people are familiar with when they were young. After being rewritten in the movie, it can be said to be &quot;beyond all recognition.&quot; But it is undoubtedly more exciting than the novel, and much better than Pu Liuxian. Although &quot;Nie Xiaoqian&quot; is famous in &quot;Strange Stories from a Chinese Studio&quot;, it is not the best chapter. I think Wang Zuxian is indeed very beautiful in this movie, and it can also be said to be the most beautiful time in his life. Some places are very poetic, such as Nie Xiaoqian hiding Ning Caichen in a water tank, in order to give Ning Caichen The scene where they had to kiss each other to take a breath was actually the highlight of the film. The tension of the atmosphere and the romance of the situation are all combined into one, and the cleverness of its conception can only be achieved by the so-called &quot;intelligent literati&quot;. But if we talk about Nie Xiaoqian&#39;s beauty, the most beautiful part is not here, but the part where she says, &quot;Ghosts are as good and bad as people, and many people in the world are more harmful to people than ghosts.&quot; Her words are so smooth and beautiful. , also complement each other. Generally speaking, the beauty of a woman&#39;s expression is to smile first, and to think secondly. Laughing and laughing wildly will inevitably impair the beauty. Therefore, the ancients had the precept &quot;laughing will not cause stagnation&quot;, &quot;smile&quot; refers to the gums, and laughter It&#39;s not beautiful when you see your gums. The same goes for crying. If you can look beautiful even when you cry, then you are truly a beautiful person. The shot of Nie Xiaoqian talking and crying at the same time is absolutely beautiful. It can also be said to be the most beautiful shot in the film. The so-called &quot;pear blossom brings rain in spring&quot; is nothing more than that! In the TV series &quot;Dream of Red Mansions&quot;, the character who plays sister Lin who loves to cry cries so much that it&#39;s hard to watch, which often ruins the scene. I have to say that this is also a failure in the drama &quot;Red&quot;. One night not long ago, I accidentally heard someone singing &quot;Flower Sacrifice&quot;. I was curious, so I searched for Wang Zuxian again and found that she was already very old. Therefore, I remembered the famous saying of the ancients: &quot;Beauty has been like a famous general since ancient times. See you grow old!&quot; Yes, everything in the world cannot withstand the flow of time. On the contrary, movies are illusory and unreal, they can remain unchanged forever, and they can allow us to relive the time that has passed! &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/20/3jyQAmXsfn8k8ngBMz8RKYLtcTMqOszICqJy04Yn.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;667&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/20/3jyQAmXsfn8k8ngBMz8RKYLtcTMqOszICqJy04Yn.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254701&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Green Snake&quot; 》(1993). This is one of Tsui Hark&#39;s best films, written by Li Bihua. I wrote a poem called &quot;Qijue&quot; about this film: &quot;Qing Lei washes the horse&#39;s sentimental bones, and shows the unparalleled beauty of Wen Jun. Such a charming person can be passed down together, and Xu Jun&#39;s talent is so wonderful.&quot; &quot;Jun&quot; is a couplet written by Feng Ban in the Qing Dynasty. I thought it was quite right, so I borrowed it. I have always believed that the best match between a talented man (including a scholar) and a beautiful woman is the most elusive. The reason is not easy to know, but it may also be caused by the fact that the same colors are placed together and cannot serve as a foil to each other. The talented man and the beautiful woman are of course the same color. The opposite is not true. For example, pairing Tu Xingsun with Deng Chanyu and Wang Dwarf with Yizhang Qing are wonderful and unforgettable. Wu Changshuo, a recent scholar, had a painting of Zhu Luanshi and orchid. He also wrote a poem about it: &quot;Like a slave from Kunlun, standing by the side of a beauty.&quot; Orchid is the national fragrance, and Zhu Luanshi&#39;s skin is very thick, so he wrote it together in One picture looks strange and interesting by contrast, which is the essence of knowing what it is. The essence of a love story is a matter of matching. If the heroine and the male character are matched well, the story will be outstanding. If they are not matched well, it will be easy to fall into the trap. The combination of a talented man and a beautiful woman is the easiest one to fall into, so writing stories about talented men and beautiful women is always thankless. This is something that even the old lady in Jia&#39;s family can criticize. &quot;Green Snake&quot; is also a story of a talented man and a beautiful woman, but it is very good. The reason why it can be like this may be because of Xiao Qing&#39;s background. This is probably why the movie is called &quot;Green Snake&quot;. But no matter what, the main body of the movie&#39;s story is actually a &quot;charming&quot; tone like Zhang Jiqing&#39;s version of &quot;The Peony Pavilion&quot;. Perhaps it can be said that &quot;Green Snake&quot; in the movie is just like &quot;The Peony Pavilion&quot; in the play, It can be used as a footnote to the words &quot;charming to the bone&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/20/03yYLvvBIobhX8CwXQhUSOs9VUAfBZok6PUU5WxS.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/20/03yYLvvBIobhX8CwXQhUSOs9VUAfBZok6PUU5WxS.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254704&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;《新龙门Inn&quot; (1992). Maggie Cheung and Joey Wong in &quot;Green Snake&quot; complement each other and perform well, but in person, it cannot be regarded as their best work. The ultimate role played by Maggie Cheung is undoubtedly the outrageous landlady Jin Xiangyu in &quot;New Dragon Gate Inn&quot;. His temperament is uninhibited, his language is sharp and fluent, and his expressions and body movements are varied. They are all unstoppable, yet natural and subtle, all of which are smooth. This should be something that ordinary viewers can appreciate. However, Jin Xiangyu is just a common man in the market. Although he is not annoying, he cannot be said to be very cute. She is not a good match for Zhou Huai&#39;an either. She finally burns down the inn and chases Zhou away on horseback. It seems that she can take Qiu Mochou&#39;s place and marry Zhou; but in fact this is just an easy way to end the movie. From an article point of view, this inn must be burned down, and Qiu Mochou had no choice but to die. Otherwise, the article would be useless. Jin Shengtan commented on &quot;Lu Zhishen&#39;s Fire Burning Waguan Temple&quot; in the fifth chapter of &quot;Water Margin&quot;. He said it well: &quot;A writer is like a painter, and like a fire gathering, he is created and destroyed at will.&quot; Movies are also articles. , the same is true. But what I admire most about this film is not that, but the fact that in the film, no less than dozens of people from all walks of life were crammed into that small inn, allowing them to express themselves in a small space. And each has its own face, ever-changing, and everyone is different. The characters are constantly fighting each other, murderous intentions are everywhere, and they are jealous. The scenery is beautiful and embellished with the beauty of &quot;sheng Xiao, drums, harps and bells&quot;. Their relationships are complicated, their crises are about to break out, and their literary sentiments It is in full swing, a grand spectacle of &quot;acting&quot;, and the center of all these characters is gold inlaid with jade, as if gold inlaid with jade is a mechanism, and all the people and affairs in it are controlled and mediated by her. In fact, she is just The clue that the film uses to string together the drama is like the &quot;hanging string&quot; of a puppet show, which moves the whole body when pulled. Not only that, although there are many characters and clues in the inn, they are not chaotic at all. At first glance, they look like leaves blown by the wind, but upon closer inspection, they are well-organized, &quot;gray lines of grass and snakes&quot;, just like what Su Shi said in his poem about painting: &quot;There are countless leaves moving in chaos, and the source can be found for each one.&quot; This is really admirable. As for the wonderful dialogue in the movie, it is still a matter of course. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/20/mJ7ZrWlcCdzDNl6PCQqTwkIziYEOGguGVBesjr8n.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1571&quot; height= &quot;2098&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/20/mJ7ZrWlcCdzDNl6PCQqTwkIziYEOGguGVBesjr8n.png&quot; data-key=&quot;254713&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Swordsman&quot; Jianghu: The Invincible East&quot; (1992). In terms of fighting action, this film is more exciting than &quot;New Dragon Inn&quot;. As far as the Invincible Dongfang played by Brigitte Lin is concerned, it is much more beautiful than the gold-encrusted jade played by Maggie Cheung. In the movie, Linghu Chong&#39;s heroic spirit, Ren Yingying&#39;s lingering affection, and the unanimous agreement of a group of Huashan disciples who want to withdraw from the world and return to Niubei Mountain, all of which make this movie more tonal than &quot;New Dragon Inn&quot;. It is warmer and more beautiful. What is inferior to &quot;New Dragon Inn&quot; is that the characters&#39; hearts are not so changeable and subtle, but slightly thicker. However, several scenes in this film can be said to be worthy of being double-circled according to the ancient method of criticizing articles. Some of them can also be marked as &quot;famous lines, there can be no two in the ages&quot;, such as the East is undefeated in the water. The scene where he is drinking from a jug of wine, and the scene where Linghu Chong is holding Dongfang Bubai and walking in the wind under the moonlight. The scene where Lan Fenghuang and Ren Yingying are sitting on the roof has a wonderful voice, which can be said to be the best in Tang Dynasty Legend and &quot;Strange Stories from a Chinese Studio&quot;. It’s just that Ren Yingying’s dresser’s face seems wrong, she looks a little older, and she speaks in a dialect, which is not only unattractive (Lan Fenghuang speaks in a dialect, but it’s not unattractive), but also doesn’t suit the status of a young lady. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/20/AUMphw2CHIOe3CFfP9re5ZJiHmz3mIHKFeu8ASdu.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;662&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/20/AUMphw2CHIOe3CFfP9re5ZJiHmz3mIHKFeu8ASdu.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254702&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Kung Fu&quot; (2004). I enjoy watching most of Stephen Chow&#39;s movies, and the reason why I recommend this one the most is because the last fight scene can be said to be the pinnacle of Chinese fight scenes. Stephen Chow loves to parody, and his scene where he beats the men in black from the Ax Gang flying all over the place should be an imitation of &quot;The Matrix Reloaded&quot;. Many years ago, I was watching &quot;Mechanic: Resurrection&quot; on TV. There was a scene where the killer jumped from a cable car to a paraglider. My son saw it and said excitedly: &quot; The game I played also had this action, and it turned out to be from here. This is the programmer&#39;s tribute to the movie!&quot; This is the first time I have heard that &quot;imitation is tribute.&quot; But I&#39;m not sure whether &quot;Kung Fu&quot; is a tribute to &quot;The Matrix&quot;. But there is no doubt that this scene in &quot;Kung Fu&quot; is much better than &quot;The Matrix&quot;. What Chinese fighting dramas value is not &quot;working hard&quot; or &quot;working hard&quot;, which is never the high state of Chinese art. What the Chinese want is to be light-weighted, to be busy, to speak in a subtle way, to wave and watch, or to be careless. , not attached to the appearance, leisurely and leisurely, all traces are gone, but &quot;the power is small but the responsibility is heavy&quot;, &quot;the tripod is lifted with great skill&quot;, it has been a great laughing stock since ancient times. This is true of everything. Therefore, although the fight scene in &quot;Kung Fu&quot; sent others flying all over the sky, Stephen Chow&#39;s own expression was not strenuous. The general atmosphere was light and beautiful, unlike in &quot;The Matrix&quot; The way Neo fights with a lot of agents in black and exhausts all his strength makes it obvious that he is better than the other. This can be seen from a comparison and needs no further explanation. If human beings indeed evolved from ancient apes, then the Chinese people must have evolved much further, and the same is true for Chinese culture. It has shed all its wildness, including spiritual and material aspects, and of course, Martial arts. As for the main theme of &quot;Kung Fu&quot;, I think it is the same as Gong Zizhen&#39;s &quot;Zun Yin&quot;: In the twilight world, heroes are born, &quot;Ugly people are ugly, deceitful and incompetent, they are chariots and they are responsible&quot;, &quot;In this case, heroes are born&quot; The capital is light, but the power in the mountains is heavy.&quot; In other words, the masters in the last days are all hidden among the people. Therefore, the official police station at the beginning of the movie is the most useless. Later, the crocodile gang, the ax gang, the tailors in the slums, the coolies and the fried ghosts, the two blind men, the charterer, the charterer, the fire cloud evil god, and a They are inconspicuous compared to each other, but each one is more skilled than the other. However, the highest master in the movie is the star who was deceived by a beggar in his most useless hour with a two-cent copy of &quot;The Palm of the Tathagata&quot;, and that copy was only The &quot;Tathagata Divine Palm&quot; worth two cents is the real &quot;martial arts secret book&quot; that is the best in the world! &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/20/fKJX1gYlMOy8NqtUWf3ignbptbgVdaFqILnIZymI.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;652&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/20/fKJX1gYlMOy8NqtUWf3ignbptbgVdaFqILnIZymI.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254705&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Cold Mountain&quot; 》 (Cold Mountain, 2003). This is a love movie set in the American Civil War. The male protagonist Inman is a soldier who deserted for the sake of his beloved Ada and wants to return to his hometown. Of course, he finally went through hardships and returned to his lover, but he was beaten to death in the end. This is an Odysseus-like story that is somewhat similar to &quot;Ten Years Home&quot;. The story itself cannot be said to be new in the West. The movie is adapted from a best-selling novel in the United States. It is said that it is a true event that happened to the author&#39;s ancestors. What I like about this movie is not the story, but the characters. The sad music that lingers in the movie also plays a significant role, because it gives the movie the tone of a long, lyrical poem. Inman, played by Jude Law, and Ada, played by Nicole Kidman, are so well matched that they are a joy to watch. I would also like to see young people become married in a well-matched love. WS Maugham once said that the maximum age for a person to fall in love should not exceed thirty-five. I think it makes sense. A love story must be a little gorgeous to be beautiful, and to be gorgeous, the first condition is youth. At the same time, in love stories, there must also be a kind of unrequited love and infatuation to move people. The word &quot;qing&quot; in the heart part of &quot;Shuowen Jiezi&quot; says: &quot;Qing refers to the yin energy of a person with desires.&quot; It is different from &quot;xing&quot; which refers to the yang energy of a person. Nature is received from heaven, which is called nature, so it is unchanging; emotions originate from human affairs, which is called human feelings, so it is changeable. There are seven emotions, including joy, anger, sadness, fear, love, evil, and desire, which are changing all the time. But things in the world are sometimes very strange. Things that are easy to change are better if they remain unchanged, and things that are not easy to change are better if they are changed. Therefore, articles become better when they are new, and love becomes better when they remain unchanged. This is also &quot;rare and valuable&quot; - because it is &quot;hard to be possible&quot;, it is &quot;valuable&quot;. This is the reason why Inman and Ada&#39;s love story touches people&#39;s hearts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/20/LXqVl4OWvfbzFMXAMCfThxewWcdHMRuVXZTTC0sB.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;2025&quot; height= &quot;3000&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/20/LXqVl4OWvfbzFMXAMCfThxewWcdHMRuVXZTTC0sB.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254706&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;《Artificial Intelligence 》(AI Artificial Intelligence, 2001). This one is relatively unnoticed among Steven Spielberg&#39;s films, but it&#39;s one of my favorites. This is a sad and sad story about a robot child who persistently searches for love. Watching this movie, I feel the same kind of melancholy that I felt when I was reading Hans Christian Andersen&#39;s &quot;The Daughter of the Sea&quot; as a child, as if somewhere in my heart was lightly touched by a piano string. For a moment, a vague sadness arose. In fact, the story of the movie is not the same as that of &quot;The Daughter of the Sea&quot;. Spielberg is really a genius. It stands to reason that robots are mechanically made, precise, high-end, effective, and have no human heart, so the machinery is ruthless; but he prefers to make a fuss about the word love, making the machine and the weakest part of human emotions create a story. This can be said to be a very unique ingenuity, and the whole movie also wins with uniqueness. The kid also acted very well. In addition, Jude Law, who played Inman in &quot;Cold Mountain&quot;, plays a robot made to be a frivolous young man in this film. He is also lifelike. It is completely different from Inman&#39;s image and is almost unrecognizable. It&#39;s also something that can be mentioned. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/20/3a5V5aE0HHpcnUndKkWzvFtLwyKFH9ZSvTYYwepR.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;615&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/20/3a5V5aE0HHpcnUndKkWzvFtLwyKFH9ZSvTYYwepR.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254707&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Interstellar&quot; ” (Interstellar, 2014). This is a movie about time. Time is a mystery in the universe, and it is also the most fascinating and troublesome thing in the universe. It has caused the contemplation of philosophers and the chanting of poets since ancient times, but it cannot be defined or captured. &quot;Life is less than a hundred years old, and we often worry about a thousand years old.&quot; Life is only a hundred years old, and a hundred years is 3.15576 billion seconds. However, what we are thinking about is sometimes 10 billion 31557600 seconds away. Every second in the universe is like a flash of lightning, fleeting, and so is every second in a hundred years. So Heraclitus of Ephesus said, &quot;On those that step into the same rivers different and different waters flow.&quot; &quot;Time withers the beauty of youth, and destroys beauty&#39;s eyebrows. It feasts on the delicacies of natural truth, and all things are waiting for its sickle to cut it.&quot; The movie directed by Nolan, 2010&#39;s &quot;Inception&quot;, is also something I like to watch; but after watching it twice, I don&#39;t want to watch it again. This is a common problem in all films (including other works) that rely on novelty to win, and it is inevitable. But &quot;Interstellar&quot; is different. Its content is much richer, and its scenes are so grand, vast, and sometimes poetic, conveying a kind of solemnity and mystery that can only be found in the deep universe. Of all the science fiction films, this is the one I have watched the most and is also my favorite. One year I read Liu Guangdi&#39;s poems, and there was a couplet in it, which was about Xiling Gorge: &quot;The big waves are sinking into traps, and the long boats stand like cones.&quot; I immediately thought of the endless shallow water on Miller&#39;s planet. Then, a huge wave came over like a cliff. The big spaceship suddenly looked like a small long box, being lifted up by the huge wave. This shot can be called one of the genius&#39;s works, and it is thrilling. Of course, it cannot be copied by the poetry of recent times. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/20/D0X5B75SkBgJM91PU5UhoRWzkST9YxnNd3rTVL3C.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1200&quot; height= &quot;1733&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/20/D0X5B75SkBgJM91PU5UhoRWzkST9YxnNd3rTVL3C.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254700&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Deep Blue&quot; (Deep Blue, 2003). This film can be said to be an epic masterpiece, a meditative masterpiece, and the work that best demonstrates the great spirit of the West. The West is indeed far superior to China in terms of majesty and grandeur, just as China&#39;s wind, spirit and elegance are beyond the reach of the West. I don&#39;t think there&#39;s anything else to say about this movie other than to watch it. Confucius said &quot;Speechless&quot;, I had the same feeling after watching this movie. In other words, criticism is sometimes unnecessary, just appreciate it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I originally wanted to make up the &quot;ten movies&quot;, but after much deliberation, I couldn&#39;t think of another one, so I had to forget it. Later, I changed my mind and remembered Wang Rongfu&#39;s &quot;Shi Sanjiu&quot;, which said, &quot;When accumulated to ten, it returns to one. Ten cannot be counted, so nine is the end of counting.&quot; Nine is the largest number, and &quot;Nine Parts&quot; &quot;movie&quot; is just the right number, so why do we need to get to &quot;ten&quot;? Moreover, aren&#39;t the lines of the sixty-four hexagrams also named after &quot;Nine&quot;, referring to the ninth day, the ninth day, the ninth day, the ninth day, the ninth day, the fifth day, etc.? In fact, it is not only &quot;nine&quot;, but also &quot;nineteen&quot;, which is also a large number. The ancient calendar uses nineteen years as one chapter. The birthdays of the lunar calendar will not coincide with the birthdays of the solar calendar after nineteen years. Therefore, &quot;Zhuangzi&quot; says &quot;Today&#39;s birthday&quot; I have been holding the sword for nineteen years.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 21 Oct 2023 17:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[多地马拉松乱象频现：利益链不能冲击比赛公正性丨快评]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259047]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-21 16:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Recently, a series of organizational problems and even &quot;accidents&quot; have occurred in marathon events in various places, causing concern. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Qingdao Maritime Marathon, which started on October 15, was chaotic. Some netizens said on social media that there were insufficient supplies at the event, personnel diversion was not in place, and the queues to receive finisher medals were too long... There were even people shouting &quot;money back&quot; at the event; the Linyi Marathon was also held on the 15th. There was also a controversial scene: when the champion runner crossed the finish line, he was blocked by two wire handlers with banners. Fortunately, the staff arrived in time and the champion finally passed smoothly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The biggest controversy occurred at the Dalian Marathon on the same day. Chinese player Yin Shunjin was blocked by a guide car in the final sprint, resulting in his failure to win the championship. This incident sparked heated discussions on social media, and the professionalism of the event organizers was also questioned. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In response to the recent chaos in marathon events, on October 19, the Chinese Athletics Association issued the &quot;Urgent Notice of the Chinese Athletics Association on Further Strengthening the Organization of National Road Running Events&quot; stating that recently, some road races have Problems in competition organization during the event have aroused widespread social attention and caused certain negative impacts. It is required to strengthen the responsibilities of all parties involved in event organization, strictly implement competition rules, investigate safety hazards, provide good service support, improve the quality of competition, and report emergencies in a timely manner. events and situations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The problems in marathon event organization have been around for a long time and are not new news. The issue of marathon event organization involves at least two levels of issues. One is the hardware facilities and conditions of the event itself, which involves the professionalism of the organizer; the other is whether the event can ensure the fairness of the competition and respect multiple civil subjects. Legitimate rights and interests on and off the playing field. These two levels of problems are always testing the level of marathon event organization in various places. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From a professional point of view, the situation that occurred in the marathons in Qingdao and Linyi was that the organizers &quot;organized the race with a disease&quot; when the hardware facilities were not up to standard and the software support was incomplete, so that Let the audience complain and let the players suffer. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lack of professionalism will naturally affect the fairness of the competition. If the Linyi Marathon&#39;s &quot;string pullers using banners&quot; can be interpreted as a lack of professional ability and ultimately did not affect the performance of the championship team members, then the situation in the Dalian Marathon will inevitably lead to interpretation in another direction. The &quot;weird steering&quot; of the Dalian guided vehicle was so unprofessional that many netizens reasonably suspected that this was an outside move by the organizer to ensure that specific athletes could obtain competition results, thus affecting the fairness of the event. question. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A closer look at the controversies in these marathon events shows that once there are problems with the professionalism and fairness of the event, athletes will be the first victims. The audience will also shout &quot;refund&quot;, and local citizens will inevitably suffer as well. . I would like to ask, can the organizer and operating company take responsibility and compensate them for their losses? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Taking this Dalian Marathon as an example, athlete Yin Shunjin suffered such a blockage from the guide car, which not only cost him his own performance. If the event is held to this extent, the audience who paid for tickets will feel like they are watching a fake marathon. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Under the current model of &quot;local governments taking the lead in hosting and operating companies for commercial development&quot;, marathon events in various regions have gradually formed a set of benefit distribution chains. The local government has become famous, the organizers have received advertising sponsorship fees, and even the competition results are suspected of being &quot;unofficially determined&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some voices in the public opinion field have questioned that in recent years, it is not uncommon for &quot;African runners to take the top three places in domestic marathons&quot;. A set of gray and black industrial chains may be involved behind this: some &quot;smart people&quot; are targeting it. In order to win the huge prize money from the marathon, he went to Africa to find outstanding athletes and sent these African athletes to compete in the name of &quot;intermediary agents&quot;. African players can only get part of the prize money, but &quot;smart people&quot; can make huge profits from it by relying on the scissor difference, and even collude with the organizers to ensure that African players win the championship through &quot;outside the game&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Guiding the car to block the people&quot;, some people think that it is a trick outside the game. The purpose is to block China&#39;s outstanding marathon runners and ensure that African runners win the championship. If this suspicion is established, then the organizer involved is not only lacking in professionalism and fairness, but may even be suspected of labor fraud, which will cause unprecedented harm to the marathon. If there is no in-depth investigation, why should Du Youyou say it? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After all, marathon is still a sport, not a cultural tourism project purely for making money. Who is the marathon for? Of course, first of all, it must be organized for the athletes to ensure the fairness of the event and improve the professionalism of the organization; secondly, it must be organized for the on-site audience, at least it must be worthy of their ticket price to watch the game, and not let people watch the game. &quot;Fake running&quot;; Finally, marathon events need to serve local citizens and respect their needs. If these are achieved, marathon events held in various places can be regarded as not betraying the original intention of sports. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to statistics from the China Marathon Information Platform, from January 1 to June 30, 2023, a total of 133 road running events across the country have been registered with the China Athletics Association, including 61 full marathons, half marathons and 72 games for other projects. The &quot;2019 China Marathon Big Data Analysis Report&quot; released by the Chinese Athletics Association also shows that of the 337 cities across the country (4 municipalities + 333 prefecture-level administrative regions), 300 cities have held marathon-scale events in 2019, accounting for 89% of the total. %. Marathon events have reached the point where “they are blooming all over the country and are held everywhere”. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Governments across the country are keen to organize competitions, hoping to enhance the image of the city. However, the recurring problems with event organization show that it is time for local governments and organizers to think about the question of &quot;why marathons are held and for whom.&quot; This ancient sport can no longer be turned into a show by a grass-roots team, nor can it be like this. He repeatedly failed to take athletes and spectators into consideration. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 21 Oct 2023 16:25:04 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
