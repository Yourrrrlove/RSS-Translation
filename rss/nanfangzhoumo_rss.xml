Aokang, a listed company bred in this small town, once became the leading company in Chinese men&#39;s leather shoes. It has been on the market for 11 years and is 35 years old. Recently, it has encountered a &quot;mid-life crisis&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the evening of August 30, Zhejiang Aokang Shoes Co., Ltd. (abbreviation: ST Aokang, 603001.SH) released its 2023 semi-annual report. In the first half of the year, ST Aokang’s revenue was 1,644.4523 million yuan, a year-on-year increase of 12.22 %, and the net profit attributable to the parent company was 8.9976 million yuan, a year-on-year increase of 177.59%. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, behind the overall red financial report is the &quot;great damage to vitality&quot; caused by the sharp decline in revenue that has lasted for many years and negative growth in 2022. In 2018, Aokang&#39;s total revenue was 3.043 billion. In 2022, the total revenue will be only 2.754 billion, and the net profit margin is even negative. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to stabilize its market share, Aokang launched sports leather shoes in the first half of this year, inviting top celebrities to endorse and Dior designers to perfect the design. However, sports leather shoes that combine traditional leather shoes with sports shoes are difficult to sell. Make Aokang &quot;change his destiny against heaven&quot;. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Taobao data shows that the price of Aokang sports leather shoes is on the high side, and the number of payers is relatively small. The best-selling celebrity sports leather shoes have more than a hundred people paying for them, while the other products have only a few people paying. ten people. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Not only Aokang, the domestic men’s leather shoe market is facing a collective winter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since 2016, China&#39;s leather shoe production has declined and overall development has been weak. The market share of men&#39;s leather shoe brands has continued to decrease. The market share of the top ten companies in terms of business scale has decreased from 10.1% in 2011. to 6.9% in 2020. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, the market for sports and leisure shoes continues to expand, almost doubling from 269.1 billion in 2018 to 425.1 billion in 2022. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to the impact of sports and leisure shoes, domestic men&#39;s leather shoes also lack the competitiveness to compete with international brands. Among the top ten best-selling men&#39;s leather shoe brands in 2020, only two are from mainland China, while the other brands come from Hong Kong, the United States, Italy and other countries or regions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Domestic brands are mostly sold for less than 500 yuan, and national brands such as Aokang and Red Dragonfly are priced at 300 to 400 yuan. They cannot get a share of the cake of the sinking economy, and it is difficult to attract high-end markets. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;How should domestic men’s leather shoes break the situation? Today, &quot;Know&quot; will talk to you about the direction of domestic men&#39;s leather shoes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/3d9e82ef980e7678295ac22ad6b76b93.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;714&quot; height=&quot;951&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/3d9e82ef980e7678295ac22ad6b76b93.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;252087&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/23abd593b2401fc57833a7c9e203bc32.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width =&quot;900&quot; height=&quot;1200&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/23abd593b2401fc57833a7c9e203bc32.png&quot; data-key=&quot;252088&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/466b2ad01f88ffcfc590e84bb112e2f1.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot; 900&quot; height=&quot;1200&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/466b2ad01f88ffcfc590e84bb112e2f1.png&quot; data-key=&quot;252089&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p >;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/c2196879c0165b00f135042ae2c094d3.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;900&quot; height=&quot;1200&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/c2196879c0165b00f135042ae2c094d3.png&quot; data-key=&quot;252090&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt; img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/44ef440319b8979b6ff10d7d39a653fd.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;900&quot; height= &quot;1200&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/44ef440319b8979b6ff10d7d39a653fd.png&quot; data-key=&quot;252091&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src =&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/c53fe59139d68e72ca1a7f6d364baa72.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;900&quot; height=&quot;1200 &quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/c53fe59139d68e72ca1a7f6d364baa72.png&quot; data-key=&quot;252092&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot; https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/e27f3596b415c5b1870b43e90b0cf1d1.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;900&quot; height=&quot;1200&quot; data -src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/e27f3596b415c5b1870b43e90b0cf1d1.png&quot; data-key=&quot;252093&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 29 Sep 2023 11:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[月神是帅哥还是美女？我们每个人都是半个月球人]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257900]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-29 10:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;The moon, as the closest celestial body to us and the only satellite of the earth, always seems to give us a sense of distance and distance. An unusual sense of closeness. Astronomers believe that the moon and the earth had a super close contact in the beginning of time:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There was an ancient dwarf planet in the early solar system, located at the Lagrange point of the earth-solar system, which was almost the same as As big as Mars. According to the giant collision hypothesis, about 4.533 billion years ago, the dwarf planet was perturbed by the gravity of Jupiter or Venus and deviated from its original position and collided with the early Earth. The debris produced by the collision eventually formed the moon. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This ancient dwarf planet is often nicknamed &quot;Theia&quot; by Western astronomers. This is the name of a Titan goddess in Greek mythology who was the mother of Selene, the moon goddess. If we compare it to Chinese mythology, we may call this dwarf planet &quot;Chang Xi&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When it comes to the birth of the moon in Chinese mythology, many people will think of &quot;Pangu opened the sky and used his eye as the moon.&quot; However, this setting actually appeared quite late. It was first seen in the Wei, Jin, Southern and Northern Dynasties: &quot;In the past, when Pangu died, his head was the four mountains, his eyes were the sun and the moon, his fat was the rivers and seas, and his hair was the vegetation.&quot; In older myths, , Chang Xi is the goddess who gave birth to the moon. She combined with the god Di Jun and gave birth to twelve moons. The earth&#39;s revolution period around the sun is exactly twelve times the moon&#39;s revolution period around the earth. Therefore, most peoples in the world divide the year into twelve months. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Compared with the coincidence of the revolution period, the changes of lunar eclipses and lunar phases provide more inspiration for earth mythology: the legend of &quot;Tengu Eclipses the Moon&quot; has long been familiar to the Chinese people; coincidentally, in In Nordic mythology, there is a similar story of &quot;Sirius swallowing the moon&quot;: The wolves hated the light created by God, so a wolf named Skull chased the sun. When a solar eclipse occurred, Skull swallowed it. sun. Another wolf named Hati was responsible for chasing the moon, and when he caught up, a lunar eclipse occurred. At this time, people on the ground will beat gongs and drums to scare away the wolf. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Australian Aboriginal mythology, the moon god is often described as a beautiful man who gradually becomes fat due to laziness (full moon). At this time, his wife, the Sun Goddess, would chop him with an ax. Although the Moon God will hide in a big tree, he will eventually die and will be resurrected 3 days after his death. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Coincidentally, the moon god Chandra in Indian mythology is also a suave and beautiful man. Legend has it that he had twenty-seven wives and promised to love each of them equally. However, after marriage, Luna broke her promise and only loved one of her wives, and refused to listen to her repeated advice. This resulted in complaints from the other twenty-six wives. The life of the Moon God disappeared due to the curse. When he was about to disappear, the Moon God sadly prayed to Lord Shiva. Lord Shiva restored the life energy of the Moon God through blessing; however, since the power of the curse cannot be taken back, the Moon God must go through the process of gain, fullness, food and loss. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, from a global perspective, handsome men on the moon are considered non-mainstream. Most of the moon gods in various countries are beauties. For example, in ancient Chinese mythology, the moon goddess is named &quot;Wangshu&quot;, and she drives a moon carriage across the sky every night. &quot;Huainanzi&quot; also adds, &quot;Yueyu is called Wangshu, and it is also called Xian&#39;a&quot;. Literally explained, &quot;Wangshu&quot; means &quot;good-looking&quot; and &quot;Xian&#39;a&quot; means &quot;beautiful and good-looking&quot;. It can be seen from these two names that the ancients obviously believed that the Moon God was a beauty. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This setting is not surprising. Compared with the sun, the moonlight appears white and cold. In addition, the moon&#39;s revolution cycle is similar to the female menstrual cycle, so it is reasonable for people to imagine the moon goddess as a beautiful woman. Selene in ancient Greek mythology was not only a beauty, but also drove a moon carriage. Among the Romans, the name of this moon god was Luna - the word &quot;luna&quot; representing the moon and the lunar calendar originated from this. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When it comes to the beauty of the moon goddess, most Chinese people will immediately think of Chang&#39;e. But Chang&#39;e is not actually called this name, and she is not the Moon God at all: Chang&#39;e is just a general name for the Fairy of the Moon Palace. She is the maid of the Moon God rather than the Moon God herself. Chang&#39;e&#39;s name was originally written as Chang&#39;e. Later, in order to avoid the taboo of Emperor Liu Heng of Han Dynasty, it was temporarily changed to &quot;Chang&#39;e&quot; simply because the two words &quot;hengchang&quot; have similar meanings. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Taboo avoidance in the Han Dynasty was not strict, and taboo avoidance was only a temporary expediency and should be changed back later. But I don’t know whether it was because Emperor Wen of the Han Dynasty was too beloved by the people, or because of the strong cultural influence of the Han Dynasty, a series of &quot;constant changes to the ordinary&quot; are still used today:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The first sentence of the &quot;Tao Te Ching&quot; &quot;The Tao can be Tao&quot; , non-constant Tao&quot; is still written as &quot;Very Tao&quot;; the &quot;Snake of Hengshan&quot; in &quot;The Art of War&quot; has always been written as &quot;Snake of Changshan&quot;, and Changshan Zhao Zilong has become an allusion; and Chang&#39;e&#39;s name is also called Today, Chang&#39;e has become a rare word. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It was also the Han Dynasty when Chang&#39;e was forced to change her name, and Queen Mother Xi replaced Wangshu and became the new Moon Goddess. Then Taoism rose, and Taiyin Xingjun became the new moon god. This Taiyin Star King is said to be the Moon Mother Chang Xi. But whether it is the Queen Mother of the West or the Lord of Taiyin, they are all images of old women. The public obviously doesn&#39;t buy this, and still retains the impression that Luna is a beautiful woman. Therefore, it is not surprising that the &quot;Fairy Chang&#39;e&quot;, as a young maid, has replaced her boss and is regarded by everyone as the real moon goddess. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In folk classics, Chang&#39;e always holds the Jade Rabbit in her arms. However, when it comes to seniority, it may be more reasonable to have the Jade Rabbit holding Chang&#39;e - the legend of the rabbit inside the moon is widely spread in East and Southeast Asia. The ancient Chinese books are among the earliest to record the legend of the Moon Rabbit. &quot;Chu Ci·Tian Wen&quot; says: &quot;What virtue is there in the moonlight, when death brings fertility? What is the benefit of the moon, but the tutu is in the belly?&quot; Therefore, the legends of various countries in East Asia and Southeast Asia The legend of the Moon Rabbit probably originated from China. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the Native Americans on the other side of the Pacific also spread the legend of the Moon Rabbit, which is even more magical: In Aztec mythology, Quetzalcoatl once descended to earth for training and almost died of hunger and thirst. At this time, a rabbit offered himself as food to save his life. Quetzalcoatl was moved by the rabbit&#39;s noble dedication, and after restoring his divine power, he promoted the rabbit to the moon god. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are many versions of the Moon God in Mayan mythology, but almost all the images of the Moon God are holding a rabbit. After the arrival of Western colonists, the Mayans were unwilling to change their beliefs, and even stitched together Christianity and Mayan mythology: the sun god became Jehovah, the moon god became the Virgin Mary, and the corn god became Jesus Christ—I don’t know. How should they explain why Maria always held the rabbit? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many scholars believe that the legend of rabbits in the moon comes from the imagination of the shadow on the moon. However, so many ethnic groups around the world have various imaginations about shadows. For example, Europeans think that shadows look like a human face. Only the groups on the east and west sides of the Pacific believe that shadows resemble rabbits, which is too much of a coincidence. Therefore, some people also suspect that the legend of the Moon Rabbit may have been widely circulated among the ancestors as early as when the Native Americans left East Asia. Native Americans arrived in North America about 12,000 to 23,000 years ago. Based on this calculation, the legend of the Moon Rabbit may have been circulated for tens of thousands of years, and even now it has actually landed on the moon:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;1969 Before Apollo 11 landed on the moon, the astronauts in the cabin mentioned Chang&#39;e and the Moon Rabbit in their conversation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lynton Johnson Space Center: There is a lot of important news about the Apollo this morning, and one of them calls your attention to a cute girl with a big rabbit. According to an ancient legend, a beautiful Chinese girl named Chang&#39;e has lived there for 4,000 years. It is said that she was exiled to the moon for stealing her husband&#39;s elixir of life. Perhaps her companion could be found - a huge Chinese rabbit, which always stood in the shade of the laurel tree and was easily spotted. The rabbit&#39;s name was not reported. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Astronaut Buzz Aldrin: OK, we&#39;ll keep an eye on that bunny girl. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;my country&#39;s lunar rover was also named &quot;Jade Rabbit&quot; to pay tribute to this beautiful and ancient myth. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, our fate with the moon goes beyond that. According to the latest large collision theory, the ancient dwarf planet did not collide with the ancient Earth, but a head-on collision. The two planets were completely destroyed, forming the asteroid belt between the orbits of Mars and Venus, and then combined to form the Earth and the Moon. This also explains why the core accounts for such a large proportion of the Earth, because the core of the dwarf planet and the core of the Earth later merged into one, and the Earth&#39;s water may also come from the dwarf planet. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From this perspective, each of us is actually half a lunar person - or half Theian/half Changxi person. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 29 Sep 2023 10:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[济南城投公司一次性售1341套现房，房从哪来？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257906]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-29 09:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/29/RCBkXjPTUSHgAgP7TQ7gS7NWtD7htfWp74i5jRj6.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/29/RCBkXjPTUSHgAgP7TQ7gS7NWtD 7htfWp74i5jRj6. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252757&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Jinan is full of high-rise buildings. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On September 22, 2023, at Qilu International Building, Jinan City, Shandong Province, Jinan Urban Development Group Assets Operation Management Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as Jinan Chengfa) has opened bids for a project - recruiting housing marketing agents. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The project is selling 1,341 units of commercial housing, with a total area of ​​about 166,000 square meters, involving 4 properties, and developers include Greenland, Longfor, Poly, etc. Based on the average listing price in September, the total value of these properties exceeds 2.8 billion yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is worth noting that these houses are all existing houses and are first-hand residences. The project tenderer, Jinan Chengfa, is not a developer, but an urban investment company engaged in real estate development and operation, and is 100% owned by the Jinan Municipal State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Not only in Jinan, on September 21, 2023, the Beijing Equity Exchange auctioned and transferred 154 properties. The transferor was the Beijing Chaoyang District Housing and Urban-Rural Development Committee, and the source of the assets was &quot;physical assets of administrative institutions.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Where do local urban investment companies and government departments get their housing from? Why are they for sale? &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;The product of &quot;competitive construction&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Lin Gang has worked in the Shandong branch of a national real estate company for seven or eight years. This time Jinan City Among the four properties for sale are projects of his company. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He told Southern Weekend reporters that the hundreds of units for sale in the project were resettlement houses built by real estate companies during land auctions, and were transferred to Jinan City Development after completion. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When the real estate market was booming in the past few years, real estate companies were vying for land across the country. In order to control land prices, local governments often limited the maximum price for land auctions. After the local auction reaches the maximum price, if the winner has not yet been determined, there will be a &quot;competition for self-sustaining&quot; and a &quot;competition for construction&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The so-called &quot;competition for construction&quot; means that after the developer&#39;s land quotation triggers the maximum price, it turns to competition for the construction area of ​​affordable housing. The one with the largest construction area is the winner. The housing provided is owned by the local government. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lin Gang recalled that the above-mentioned land was purchased around 2018. In order to successfully bid, the company built two buildings as resettlement houses in a community of two to three thousand households, which increased the cost by more than 60 million yuan. But after the house was put on the market, the market price dropped and the entire project lost money. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At that time, Jinan had just begun to implement &quot;competitive construction&quot;, which was still a minority in the country. Many cities usually use a lottery method to determine the winner after the land price triggers the maximum price limit. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lin Gang said that Jinan’s “competition for construction” has continued until now. In addition to the projects developed by his company, other properties sold in Jinan City Development this time are also the product of &quot;competition for construction&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;competition-to-build&quot; housing was originally used as local affordable housing. Especially since the State Council issued the &quot;Opinions on Accelerating the Development of Affordable Rental Housing&quot; in 2021, various places have accelerated the financing of affordable rental housing. Listings. In August 2022, Jinan Chengfa publicly purchased 3,000 units of commercial housing as rental reserves. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, Lin Gang admitted that the rental effect of the resettlement houses built by his company in the community was not good. The above-mentioned project, which was put up for sale by Jinan Chengfa, was completed in 2020. In 2022, I heard that two buildings would be used for lease by the government. The owners who had already moved in expressed their opposition and were worried that the mix of tenants would affect the community environment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Some owners have come up with a plan and want to build a wall in the community to separate the two supporting buildings.” Lin Gang said that the owners’ opinions were fed back to Jinan Chengfa. The other party did not agree. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Because there are no companies near the community, it is not convenient for office workers to rent here and commute. The rental rate of the two resettlement houses has not been high. For Jinan Chengfa, this means limited rental income. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Affected by the downturn in the real estate market, Jinan’s government fund income, which mainly comes from land sales, has been almost halved. Data from the Jinan Municipal Finance Bureau show that the city’s government fund revenue fell to 54.7 billion yuan in 2022 from 101.6 billion yuan in the previous year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“There have been very few land auctions in Jinan in the past four or five years.” Lin Gang said that under the influence of real estate regulation and the new crown epidemic, major real estate companies are shrinking, and Jinan’s land auction market continues to be cold. In order to maintain the team, his company has only acquired two pieces of land in Jinan in the past two years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In its prediction of the fiscal revenue and expenditure situation in 2023, the Jinan Municipal Government pointed out that fiscal operations are still in a state of tight balance, and the pressure to increase revenue, reduce expenditure and prevent risks is very high. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to alleviate the contradiction between fiscal revenue and expenditure, the Jinan Municipal Government proposed in the 2023 budget report to increase the profit handover ratio of municipal state-owned enterprises to 20%, and transfer the municipal-level state-owned capital operating budget to the general public budget proportion increased to 35%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For Jinan Chengfa, who has a house in hand, the income from selling houses is obviously more substantial than renting. Taking the housing listings in Huatongyuan Community in Greenland as an example, Anjuke showed that the monthly rent for a three-bedroom apartment of about 140 square meters is 5,000 yuan, and the rent per square meter is about 38 yuan/month. If sold, the new house price is 22,000 yuan/square meter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporters called Jinan Chengfa many times, but the staff declined the interview because the person in charge was not available. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Revitalizing idle properties&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Actually, this is not the first time Jinan State-owned Assets has sold commercial housing. In July 2023, the Dongcheng Yijia Community developed by Jinan Urban Construction Investment Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as Jinan Urban Construction) was put on sale. Another property owned by the company, Xijiang Huafu, also announced that it will be launched for sale in the second half of 2023. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the equity penetration, Jinan Urban Construction is 90% owned by the Jinan State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission and 10% by the Shandong Finance Department. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These two communities are called &quot;civil servant communities&quot; in Jinan. Southern Weekend reporters consulted in the name of home buyers. The sales staff of Jinan Urban Construction Yi said that the two communities combined have a total of about 12,000 units, which were completed and delivered in 2016 and 2019. Half of the building was previously sold to civil servants, and the remaining half has been vacant until 2023. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among them, Dongcheng Yijia Community has more than 4,000 units for sale this time, and Xijiang Huafu has more than 1,000 units, which are expected to be officially launched after the National Day holiday. &quot;The two properties were originally off-plan properties and were sold internally by civil servants around 2013. The selling price was equivalent to the market price at that time.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At that time, Lin Gang was still working as a real estate reporter for a newspaper in Jinan. &quot;When I got to know this community, people had already chosen a house.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2009, Jinan hosted the 11th National Games and built a new Olympic Sports Center in the east of the city as the main venue. After the National Games, the Jinan Municipal Government also began to move eastward, moving into the Long&#39;ao Building, which is more than 100 meters away from the Olympic Sports Center. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Civil servants from Jinan Municipal Government units subsequently moved to Longao Building to work. Many civil servants did not have houses or lived far away. In order to meet the housing needs, two residential communities, Dongcheng Yijia and Xijiang Huafu, were built. Judging from the distance displayed on the map software, the two communities are both within 3 kilometers of Longao Building. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In October 2022, the Ministry of Finance issued the &quot;Guiding Opinions on Revitalizing State-owned Assets of Administrative Institutions&quot;, requiring the implementation of the government&#39;s tight living requirements and accelerating the revitalization and utilization of various state-owned assets such as houses, land, and vehicles. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Today, more than 5,000 units of existing houses have been put on the market in two communities, Dongcheng Yijia and Xijiang Huafu, and Jinan&#39;s property market has been shocked. &quot;This is amazing. The total number of online new houses signed in Jinan a year is only 40,000 to 50,000 units.&quot; Lin Gang sighed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The above-mentioned Jinan urban construction staff said that the current price of a small apartment of 95 square meters in Dongcheng Yijia is about 25,000 yuan/square meter, and the price of a large apartment of 175 square meters is about 29,000 yuan/square meter. Data from Lianjia.com shows that this price is lower than second-hand houses in the same area. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Because these two communities are all rough housing.” She said that in the two months since Dongcheng Yijia went on sale, more than 400 units have been sold. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lin Gang said that these two communities were built earlier, and the unit designs are not outstanding, which has also lowered the price to a certain extent. However, it has a superior location and is equipped with a high-quality school district. It is still popular after being listed and has a certain impact on surrounding second-hand houses. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The 154 properties transferred by the Housing and Urban-Rural Development Committee of Chaoyang District, Beijing are similar to those in Jinan. This batch of properties is located in the China Railway Construction International City Community, and the listing price is also lower than the price of second-hand houses in the same community. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the &quot;Economic Observer&quot; report, after the completion of China Railway Construction International City, some houses were repurchased by Chaoyang District Housing and Urban-Rural Development Committee and other units, with plans to use them to solve the housing problem of employees. Later, it was not fully implemented as planned, and some of the houses remain vacant to this day. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Staff from the Chaoyang District Housing and Urban-Rural Development Committee provided Southern Weekend reporters with the phone number of the person in charge, but no one answered the call. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(Lin Gang is a pseudonym at the request of the interviewee)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 29 Sep 2023 09:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[掰掰告别狮子林桥后，天津还有哪些快乐？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257898]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-29 08:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 29 Sep 2023 08:25:04 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[东亚家庭的悲剧与温情，全程哭着看完]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257890]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-28 23:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data-mpa-powered-by=&quot;yiban.io&quot;>;The son who has been away from home for many years suddenly received a call from his old man. How will he face the call from his mother who wants to take a posthumous photo and explain what happened after her death? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The documentary &quot;House of God&quot; from Taiwan starts with this phone call and reveals the painful past of a family. The son in the film is the documentary director Lu Yingliang. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/28/5e40d477465b42d4a99706cdccee27b2.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;1542&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/28/5e40d477465b42d4a99706cdccee27b2.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;252723&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The film is in Last year, it won four awards including the million-dollar first prize, the Best Documentary Award, the Best Editing Award and the Audience Choice Award at the Taipei Film Festival. It was also enthusiastically received during the film festival in Switzerland, and it also has a good score of 8.3 on Douban. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Because the film cuts into the native family from the director&#39;s perspective and shows every detail of rural life, many people compared it to the 2017 &quot;Four Spring&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, in addition to similar themes, similar perspectives, and both being filmed over a longer period of time, the emotional undertones of the two films are actually very different. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/28/551c0fa59ff4e2e0b15fb68fce76c31b.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;1620&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/28/551c0fa59ff4e2e0b15fb68fce76c31b.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;252724&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;《Four &quot;Spring&quot; is like a simple literary utopia. We long to grow up in such a family, enjoy the influence of music, and have a warm life like the director; and &quot;House of Gods&quot; reproduces another situation of East Asian families - There was no dialogue, they tortured each other, and after &quot;living&quot; based on instinctive consciousness, they escaped from this cursed place. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The mother who is thin and works all day long; the father who has nothing to do and is addicted to lottery tickets; and the brother who is just muddling along and accomplishing nothing. Director Lu Yingliang does not directly show the desperate state of these family members, but through a &quot;god&quot;. A rare perspective that reflects everyone&#39;s inner world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the director&#39;s hometown, there has always been a strong belief in gods, and the Lu family attaches particular importance to it. They have a separate room upstairs for worshiping a shrine and an incense altar. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/28/355fc9f42b250a57564de8f63af746e6.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;613&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/28/355fc9f42b250a57564de8f63af746e6.png&quot; data-key=&quot;252725&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;All this source When Yu Lu Yingliang&#39;s brother was 12 years old, he suddenly became &quot;psychic&quot; and was chosen by the gods. He became a celebrity who traveled far and wide to seek guidance from gods. For many years after that, in addition to farm work, my brother also worked part-time as a fortune teller for others, and the Lu family became connected with the gods. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But through the director’s lens, we will find that family members have different attitudes towards gods. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although my mother is in poor health, she still climbs up and down every day to worship the gods. When asked repeatedly by her son why she persisted, she said lonelyly: &quot;In the past, when your brother left home, you and your father were not at home. Your sister went to work, and I was the only one left at home. They were all there to accompany me.&quot; Me.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/28/a599f88aa86a6400037aa147b2a4c52d.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080 &quot; height=&quot;604&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/28/a599f88aa86a6400037aa147b2a4c52d.png&quot; data-key=&quot;252726&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Unlike his mother&#39;s simple emotional sustenance, his father is utilitarian towards gods. He always wanted to guess the numbers from the smoke coming out of the incense and use it to buy lottery tickets. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;My brother, who has been dealing with gods for half his life, gradually fell into an embarrassing situation on camera. The film specifically uses the &quot;little tomato incident&quot; to expose the conceptual gap between the two generations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before planting tomatoes, my brother specifically asked the gods for instructions on the farming date. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/28/224bc1a4bc313d1d17b872c64c05f5a5.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;602&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/28/224bc1a4bc313d1d17b872c64c05f5a5.png&quot; data-key=&quot;252728&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But right here Not long after the fruit seedlings were planted, heavy rains for days flooded the farmland, but the gods did not play any role. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The young nephew was unwilling. He first said angrily that he had stopped believing in gods for a long time, but soon after, he burst into tears, hoping that his brother could ask the gods to find a solution. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The elder brother did not want to deceive his son, but in order to soothe the next generation&#39;s uneasiness and confusion, he could only pretend to have a breath with the gods, saying that Hua Tuo would greet his friends and solve the dilemma. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Here, God becomes the comforter of this ordinary family. When the family finds no hope in reality, the more they place their hope on the gods. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/28/9b655e87cb3cd81be4aa2e6434d3b5a0.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;604&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/28/9b655e87cb3cd81be4aa2e6434d3b5a0.png&quot; data-key=&quot;252727&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Like a director When my brother was doing farm work, he asked in despair and confusion: &quot;Do you really think God has helped our family? Or should I say, is there really a God?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are few Chinese speakers. The film explores such metaphysical themes, not to mention situating this discussion among members of a rural family. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, we don’t need to compare &quot;House of God&quot; with religious films such as &quot;First Reformed&quot; and &quot;The Last Temptation of Christ&quot;. Director Lu Yingliang does not have this ambition. The reason why he Raising this question is based on his despair for his original family. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/28/efcf3ab445698828ae8311d7db21a9fb.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;604&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/28/efcf3ab445698828ae8311d7db21a9fb.png&quot; data-key=&quot;252729&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lu Yingliang&#39;s father He almost never fulfilled his responsibilities and only knew how to idle around. Even because of gambling debts in his early years, the whole family had to move. Although his elder brother was good-hearted, he lacked ability and failed to start his own business several times. He had to borrow money to pay off the debts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lu Yingliang had no choice but to work hard in a big city at the age of 18 and almost never came back because he knew that once he fell into this house of gods and men, he would become the same as those god tablets and become the entrustment of the whole family. &quot;hope&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From the beginning of the film until the middle and later stages, Lu Yingliang rarely appears in the picture. He basically communicates sparsely with his family in voice-over, and is full of confrontation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This situation did not change until my father was suddenly diagnosed with cancer. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/28/e1175bd37c5b0692749d2ef4e85ea3f8.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;601&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/28/e1175bd37c5b0692749d2ef4e85ea3f8.png&quot; data-key=&quot;252731&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lu Yingliang finally decided I helped my parents take photos of their deaths, and when choosing photos, I had a rare conversation with my father, and the family sat together, a rare moment of warmth and harmony. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I believe this scene will make many people cry secretly, because its tenderness uses the photo of the deceased (death) as a bridge to connect. The resentment that had been built up for many years gradually dissipated, not because the Lu family was on the right track, but because his father would eventually pass away. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is a sad ending for an East Asian family. Just like the recent &quot;That Time The Ghost and I Became Family&quot;, the father played by Tuo Zonghua finally opened his heart because Mao Bangyu had passed away. Regret makes people put aside their prejudices and their attitudes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/28/13e3dceb1b845daa801316bac97ef234.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;605&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/28/13e3dceb1b845daa801316bac97ef234.png&quot; data-key=&quot;252732&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;《神人Near the end of &quot;Home&quot;, Lu Yingliang finally returned to the home that had made him frustrated. He tasted the sweetness from the tomatoes grown by his brother, and took his mother on a train to see the sea, fulfilling her long-cherished wish. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The place where this old woman lives is actually only a few dozen kilometers away from the coastline. When she was young, apart from her wedding photo, she only had one green and beautiful photo. All her life since then has been dedicated to it. Three children and a useless husband. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If there is a god in &quot;House of Gods&quot;, then it is Lu Yingliang&#39;s mother. She is the real glue of this family. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/28/c659b1d78540742f7908265a93145cec.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;599&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/28/c659b1d78540742f7908265a93145cec.png&quot; data-key=&quot;252730&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Watch &quot;God When reading &quot;Human Home&quot;, it always reminds me of Huang Zi&#39;s &quot;Xiaowei&quot; and Dapeng&#39;s &quot;Auspicious Ruyi&quot;. One of these two films is an art film, and the other is a documentary in the form of a meta-film, but to some extent, they both belong to the category of private family films. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The creators of these films have honestly presented the disease, death and discord among members of the original family, whether it is long-term silent hostility or uncontrollable tension. It all reminds us of the past. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;House of Gods&quot; may not be called a blockbuster of the year, let alone a high achievement on the visual level, but the sincerity of emotional expression is indeed something that has not been seen for a long time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Director Lu Yingliang went from watching his family worshiping gods with a cold eye, to shifting his perspective away from the gods and towards his parents and brothers. This change in perspective is clearly visible. This tells us invisibly that he no longer carefully observes himself and his family in a binary opposition, but chooses to recognize his former identity and accompany his mother on the endless coastline. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 28 Sep 2023 23:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[当幼儿园的儿子变得“社会”时，父亲在想什么丨养儿育女]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257882]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-28 22:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;My son, who is in the third grade of kindergarten, came back from school one night and told me in a low mood: Dad, I can’t do it tomorrow. Because I was talking to my classmates today, the primary teacher who was supposed to be on duty tomorrow was assigned to another classmate by the teacher. I said it didn&#39;t matter, there would be another chance in the future, and then I pulled him with a smile to get ready to play.没想到我这消极打马虎眼的态度被儿子狠狠训斥了一番，他说不行，这样他就少做了一次，自己下次不能再和同学乱讲话了，听得我一愣一愣的，实在好奇他为何会对做小老师如此上心。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在我的温和追问下，儿子诉说了自己想当小老师的真相：因为这样可以管别的小朋友。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;回答让我大吃一惊，这显然是对权力渴望的表现。听说这是老师为了方便日常管理，对表现好的小朋友赋予的一种权力，担任小老师的小朋友可以帮老师代管其他小朋友，主要表现在可以批评行为不规范的小朋友。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我本想给儿子进行一番灌输，告诉他这样的想法是错误的。刚说出一句，我的底气已经不足，知道自己的教条说辞一定会被他抵触。我就换了种说法：当小老师的时候要去给小朋友服务，发现有小朋友犯错误时不要大声训斥，不然对方会伤心的，要语气谦和。儿子很老成地说，知道了。看来他已经习惯了这个小老师的游戏规则，这是我始料未及的。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;他说，小老师有时候挺难做的。有一次，他和一名同学同时担任小老师，他的好朋友讲话被那名同学点名罚站，他想通融一下，但是被同学拒绝了，这让他很苦恼不知怎么办。还有一次，他做小老师时批评了某同学，过了几天那个同学做小老师时故意点了他的名。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这些诉说听得我愕然，不知所措的同时又觉得很熟悉，这不就是我们成年人的职场缩影嘛，也太“社会”了。儿子没听懂我说的“社会”是什么意思，我告诉他，对方的做法是错误的，你不能这样做。问了几个有小孩的朋友，他们反馈也有类似的情况。唯一能找到安慰的点，大概就是这样的机制可以约束孩子一些课堂上的不规范行为，但也不一定有效。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;或许小孩也不想变得太“社会”，有时候也像我们成年人一样别无选择，或者是深陷其中而不自知。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;儿子同学的妈妈给我讲了一件事：有一次，我儿子告诉她，某天她家孩子在学校被老师罚站在教室后面，还和别的小朋友说话。她问我儿子，你怎么知道的，他也没犹豫地说，我们俩一起说话被老师罚站了。听完之后我们大笑起来，本想着告别人的状，一下子把自己给暴露了，或许这是一种“社会”与纯真的反差碰撞吧。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;很多时候，儿童的世界在成人化，孩子过早地体验了成人社会的规则和困惑。我们在面对自己的问题时通常会显得无力或者摆烂，当孩子遇到同样处境时，又如何能奢求他们完美无瑕呢？ &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;某天去接儿子放学，他兴高采烈地说，今天他做值日生了。我心想，一个值日生有什么好嘚瑟的，不就是一份义务劳动？可他告诉我，值日生是帮老师扫地和摆放椅子的，是老师分配给他的一项任务，无上光荣。想想小孩的“社会”或许也有欣慰的一点，那就是快乐的门槛很低。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;最近我在网上看了一部电影叫《再见，我们的幼儿园》，剧中幼儿园小朋友在毕业典礼上唱了一首歌，“我们在这里度过了无数的日日夜夜，我们笑过很多次，哭过很多次，感冒过很多次，我们和这么多亲爱的朋友在这里玩耍，我们在这里奔跑过，在这里跌倒过，在这里打过架，再见我们的幼儿园，这里是我们的游乐场”。歌声和歌词让我很感动，幼儿园就应是纯洁的快乐游乐场，少点社会的羁绊和苦恼。我向儿子推荐了这部电影，起先他是拒绝的，但当我告诉他这是几个小朋友以探险的方式去探望一个生了重病的好朋友时，他表示很感兴趣。那个周末的下午，因为没有国语配音，我声情并茂地给他朗读完所有台词。影片结束后，他说他要哭了，我知道他一定是和剧中的小朋友一样有了对他人悲伤和快乐的共情。 &lt;/p>;

&lt;h4>;荒诞秀&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;18张脸贴地，18双手绷直。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;18位身着黑色队服的员工，平趴在一个酒店会议厅的舞台上，以朝拜的姿态，指向给团队面貌打分的评委席——培训导师的座位。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;评委打出的高分，就像一个黑洞，把8支由员工组成的队伍吸入了无限的排演和竞争中。似乎被分配了“战狼”“电狼”“野狼”的队名之后，人的狼性就能被激发出来。不爱锻炼的销售人员，在没有安全防护的情况下，叠起了四层罗汉；平时慢声细语的女孩，一边踢正步一边嘶吼出“大家好”，以争团队荣耀；为表达对企业的感恩之心，一支队伍索性集体下跪。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;会议厅的大门，早晨8点前就被勤勉练习的队员推开，直到凌晨1点才恋恋不舍地关上。耗尽精力地排练，只是为了其中一支队伍能展示最奇特的姿态、最整齐的步伐、最洪亮的口号。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;公司组织的这次团建，让李扬也成为了奇观的表演者。之前他不敢相信，自己会把“伏首投地”当作风采来展示。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;李扬是某民营灯具公司的销售，刷抖音看到别人团队展示的视频时，他总是对那些浮夸的动作嗤之以鼻。没想到，如今的视频中人，竟是自己。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2023年8月一个平常的周末，江苏常州，在人事部门的扣薪威胁中，李扬和其他两百多位同事一起，愤愤不平地坐上了团建的大巴。在团建的酒店，他们昼夜不分地倾情投入所有活动，丝毫不惧留下嘶哑的嗓子、跌伤的肢体、感冒的状态，仿佛一切从一开始就是心甘情愿的。被迫“加班”的怒气和自费100元的团建费，似乎只是“灵魂升华”过程中需要克服的小小关卡。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;培训活动的升华，在于让员工学会“感恩”，这是公司老板的诉求。李扬回忆，这次团建的确有时会触及一些员工柔软的内心。听着培训导师的渲染，一位背井离乡的员工噙着泪水顿悟：要把企业当成自己的“家”；老板背着两个员工，气喘吁吁地绕会场跑步，以模拟“创业之艰辛”，李扬看了也会动恻隐之心。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;不过，理智提醒他，这些煽情之处，更像是萦绕在畸形逻辑上的迷雾：“导师说，老板背着员工跑，就好像他创业时为了员工负重前行。我怎么觉得是反过来呢，明明是员工托举着老板负重前行。导师只是想让我们产生愧疚心理、好好干活罢了。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;李扬确实有愧疚之心，但这与公司的恩情无关，而更多与自己的违心之举有关。他忏悔，自己不明白这些游戏的价值，却成为维系其运行的部件；知道导师的“谎言”，却接受其每一个指令。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;从上一家公司离职后，这是李扬到此公司的第一年，还没站稳脚跟。他不敢站出来反驳什么，“当不了那种敢为天下先的人。”眼看着一批“00后”同事在体验了第一天集训后就趁夜色溜走，李扬的脚还是钉在原地。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;留下的人，和李扬一样，把“乖巧”进行到底。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;以“团队协作”为训练目的的“生死电网”：近三百人依次穿越同一张网洞，有人触网，一切清零重来。整个过程持续了4个多小时，监督者一次次打断，队员们麻木地重复着令人崩溃的动作。旨在教人自我反省的冥想：当大家在舒缓的音乐中静思时，十几位培训助理猛然从黑暗中冲出来，对员工破口大骂。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;对于团建的发起者老板，李扬无太多怨言。他最反感的是发布命令和设计课程的培训导师“郭施兄”——一位四十多岁男性，教育背景和资质证书不明，自称“大师”。“他喜欢对我们问封闭式问题，口头禅是&#39;听懂掌声&#39;，就像搞传销的。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/lHBup7JvgoG3V87TLGXrNJ1Y9JzN0VMY92m0mYQl.jpg&quot;

&lt;p>;郭导师，只是这个封闭会场的其中一个符号。与他一同压抑着参与者自由行动的，还有悬挂于四壁的条幅：“爱他就是严格要求他”“没有你我，只有我们”“你不提供结果，老板承担后果”；还有为前三甲设立奖金的游戏机制、两百多件统一的黑色T恤、一声高过一声的队列呐喊。李扬解释，“虽然觉得荒诞，但在那个环境下，大家都这么做了，你也只有跟着做。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/WtiOFFAbblHFrnkf54zAo7rXxfnwuRJW8TuW6aFV.jpg&quot;

&lt;p>;无论体验感好坏，“团建”都是当今多数打工人避之唯恐不及的职场枷锁。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;像李扬一样凭着理性在团建中经受某些魔幻操作，算不上什么新鲜事。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;源源不断的公司，把员工送上了打鸡血、侮辱人格的团建之旅。网络上，每隔一段时间，就会出现诸如“互扇耳光式团建”“为领导磕头式团建”“残酷求生式团建”的热搜。曾令人咋舌的新闻，如今已让人习以为常。它们似乎构成了我国职场文化的一个部分，程度极端，状态稳定。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“现在的团建并不是培训”，“团建偏向娱乐甚至被妖魔化了”，“劣币驱逐良币”，这是体验式培训机构人众人华南区总经理夏虓对当今团建市场的评价。比起“团建”，行业中人更喜欢用“体验式培训”来称呼这些旨在挑战自我、熔炼团队、提高绩效的企业团队训练。夏虓说“团队建设”最初只是体验式培训中的一门课程名称，因为它设计难度低、目标宽泛、需求量大，逐渐成为同行最爱推广的类型。其中的游戏、活动又是最容易被模仿的，因而“团建”也变成了企业团队各类活动的代名词。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;市场上，充斥着各色各样的体验式培训师。有的，像“郭导师”一样专司企业课程，擅长用鸡汤故事和游戏命令，把自己塑造成权威；有的，从军训教官转行，在户外项目中继续享受着这份工作特有的控场感；更多的，则在轻松的团建旅行中充当“导游”的角色，他们很少作出引导总结，在员工心中面目模糊。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在国内，目前没有统一的、官方的体验式培训师入行专业资格证书。培训机构设置培训师的准入门槛，都是各自为政。夏虓介绍，或许我们会看到许多“团建联盟”，它们推出了一些培训师考核标准，但那都属于“民间认证”。人众人的培训师在正式上岗前会经历半年的培训师课程学习和半年的内部考核。陕西的胡老师凭借之前做军训教官的经历以及在网上自学拓展培训知识，到熟人的公司直接就可以上岗。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;对于培训师资质的参差不齐，上海众基拓展的总经理林伟感到惆怅不已。“某些同行，把体验式培训扭曲为军训、魔鬼训练。不是这样的。它应该是比较温和的。”他更痛惜的，是体验式培训黄金时代的落寞。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;28年前，当体验式培训从欧美经香港传入中国内地时，并不像今天这样臭名昭著。彼时，它是一个小众、专业、消费层级高、易收获客户认可的行业。  &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;要为体验式培训找一个真正意义的词源，那就是Outward Bound，“户外拓展”“外展训练”都曾是它的译名。在海外，它的身份不是一项面向企业的服务，而是一种教育模式。其前身，是由德国犹太裔教育家库尔特·汉恩（Kurt Hahn）二战时期在威尔士创办的同名海员学校。汉恩相信，为期一个月的野外生存训练，能让学员通过“亲身体验”突破自我、磨练意志，形成紧密的团队联结。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;国内第一个吃螃蟹的企业，是人众人。1995年，人众人把Outward Bound引入中国，将它做成企业培训业务，在中国推广开来，并为之注册了“拓展训练”的商标。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;行内人把21世纪初体验式培训行业最繁荣的那十年，唤作“拓展训练时代”。2004年，林伟刚入行时，体验式培训师是一个带有光环的职业。和林伟一同来参加第一轮面试的，大多是硕士以上学历，其中不乏博士，甚至有寒暑假做兼职的大学教师。教育学、心理学背景的本科生也有机会入选，不过最好有三年以上工作经历。经过第一轮精挑细选后，剩下的12位候选人要到基地接受一个月的培训课程。一边上课，一边被淘汰。最后，只剩５人走上正式岗位。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;吸引林伟入行的，是这份职业带来的高薪和尊严。2004年，一般白领的月薪在5000元左右，而一位上海的培训师每月上15次课，能拿到2万多元的工资。一次课程持续1-2天，一位培训师负责带十多位学员。无论是普通的员工，还是身价不菲的企业家，都将培训师尊称为“老师”——不是通过说教，而是通过引导和鼓励，让学员超越之前无法达到的极限。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在高空断桥这个经典项目中，学员需要爬上８米高的架子，走上一块中断的窄木板，从一头跳到另一头。当然，是在佩戴防坠器的情况下。每当学员因恐高在起跳点颤抖时，林伟就在桥边说安抚性的话，教他们深呼吸、降低身姿，告诉他们“可以做到”。复盘环节，林伟会总结学员的表现，解释游戏背后的心理学机制，“突破情景压力和预期压力，人就能走出舒适圈，获得成长。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;学员们和培训师分开时都依依不舍，他们甚至欢呼着，把培训师高高抛起。林伟认为，“在这么短的时间内获得人们如此大的认可，这是其他职业不可比拟的。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;如今，林伟再也不能从学员的眼中看到从前的崇敬和仰慕，“他们不再称培训师为老师，转叫&#39;教练&#39;。但是，这并不是一个训练人技巧的职位。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;据看准网统计，目前上海体验式培训师的平均工资在1.3万元左右。林伟告诉《南方人物周刊》，最初那批高素质的培训师，现在大多转行做企业内训（一种对症下药、偏重理论讲解的企业咨询）。随他们一起离开的，还有林伟的热情，一种“看到周围同行都很优秀，从他们身上可以学习很多”的热情。他不理解，为什么健身教练也能当培训师，“体能不是重点，通过体验提升头脑的认识，才是目的。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;体验式培训的投资门槛低、收入高、市场需求大，各类活动课程也都很容易复制。“高端行业”的下沉，导致这个行业吸纳了众多逐利者，但内部缺乏规范制约。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;客户青睐有趣的活动，不关心其背后的“培训价值”。与之适应，需要精心设计提纲、注重教育内涵的拓展训练课程，业务比重在减少；简单的娱乐类团建（例如单纯的游戏、趣味运动、主题活动），比重在增加。娱乐类团建在人众人的业务中占50%，在众基占比高达70%。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;林伟指出，现在的团建，就像让参与者单纯地看电影。观看时，他们情绪波动很大；走出影院后，黑暗中发生的事对以后的生活毫无影响。“其实，影后的分享环节才是最有价值的，之前的培训就是要引导学员说出这些&#39;观影体验&#39;。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/EsBEbeEWTuyWxB7uIFakKT3iBXPjaMjNLP8a3lAZ.jpg&quot;

&lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;在个人层面，康莹把她参加的团建，都看作是“对灵魂的洗涤”。但是，她坚信，团建不可能拉近员工和企业的关系&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（视觉中国/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;团建并没有那么重要&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;六年前从美国回国的康莹，在刚接触团建的时候，充满了孩子般的探索欲。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;1999年大学毕业后，康莹一直在美国工作。2017年回国，先后在国内两家医药公司做总监。近年，她才解锁团建这种国内特有的员工集体活动，“觉得挺新鲜、挺好玩，就还比较投入。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;至今，康莹仍感激两年前那场沙漠徒步团建给她带来的精神财富。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一天，15公里，敦煌戈壁。对于平时不怎么锻炼的康莹而言，这是天文数字。得知团建内容后，她几乎产生辞职念头。彼时，她被服务商拉入了一个微信群，此群专为之后的徒步做准备工作。培训师要求群内员工打卡，从每天跑步一公里开始。里程数逐渐增加，直到每天８公里。同事们一起打卡，相互鼓励。康莹咬牙坚持下来了。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这项活动，甚至让她养成了运动习惯。“很难想象，没有这个群，我单独一人能否跑8公里。之后，我成功减肥20斤，整个人都逆生长了。好像真的培养了一些坚毅的品质。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;沙漠的长途跋涉，耗尽了康莹靠跑步练就的体力，也让她体验到了情谊。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;徒步活动早晨7点出发，计划沿“玄奘西行”路线8小时走完15公里。只过了3小时，康莹就迈不动腿了。人生46年，她第一次感受到体力透支的绝望。仰头望着巨大的沙坡，她停在原地发呆。身旁突然传来一位同事的声音：“你不要想太多，左脚踏在这个沙窝，右脚踏在那一个，一步步爬上去。”其余同事也不急着赶路，停下来告诉她爬坡的窍门。培训师一边递水，一边鼓励她。坡，终于翻过去了。艰苦环境下结成的互助情谊，也持续到今天。 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“事后我在想，工作中也是这样。我作为上级，需要团队的下属克服困难的时候，就不该威胁说：要是做不成提着脑袋来见我。应该站在他们的点位，多给出具体指导。哪怕只是&#39;先迈左脚后迈右脚&#39;这么简单。”康莹总结道。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在个人层面，康莹把她参加的团建都看作是“对灵魂的洗涤”。但是，她坚信，团建不可能拉近员工和企业的关系。诸如“加强员工对企业的归属感”“加深对企业文化的认同”之类的效果，在康莹看来，都是团建广告营造的幻觉。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;如果说，沙漠团建在康莹心中帮公司积攒了些许好感，那么这点好感在之后怠惰的工作环境和职场派系斗争中已消磨殆尽。康莹认为，CEO的行事风格才是实质上影响一个公司的企业文化最大的因素。CEO发现下属甩锅，却不出面制止，甩锅行为在公司就会不断发生。康莹在公司的直属上司是总经理，但她曾接到人事部的传话：集团CEO希望她成为自己的耳目——随时上报总经理的一切动向，包括私生活。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;想到领导可能在四处埋眼线、搞权谋，公司却乐此不疲地组织团建，营造齐心协力的场面，康莹就对团建本身的意义产生了质疑。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;同样在两年前，公司融资失败，进行大规模裁员，康莹失业了。爬过的高山，听过的演说，拼过的比赛，悟过的哲理，像一场梦，什么都没有留下。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;康莹表示，现在期望通过团建获得在企业中的“归属感”，实在是过于勉强。假如她能在一家公司工作十年以上，自然会对它产生“家”的感觉。但这两年，她不知道企业会不会在哪天弃她而去。一场团建，无法化解这种危机感。康莹认为，如果员工表现出了对公司的情感依赖，那大概率是一场表演，为了“展示服从性”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;有时，团建不只是员工对上级的表演，也是企业对外界的表演。人众人的一位工作人员透露，许多客户在预定体验式培训服务时，更多是出于宣传的目的。精良的视频团队、多机位的拍摄、高档的设备、纯熟的剪辑，让团建活动被记录为大片，成为招新的广告。演员的实际感受并不重要，培训目的是否达到也不重要，重要的是向外展示“这是一次振奋人心、成绩斐然的集体活动”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;佩戴面具，可能是一些人的生存法则。也有人在尝试摘下面具。2023年8月，湖南的一家公司因为担心集体出游会对一些员工造成不适，改为每人发3500元，自由处置；成都某公司的人事啵啵发现，当老板安排周末团建时，没人报名，于是发起全员投票，将活动定在周五下午。尚不知道，他们会失去什么，但他们好像找回了一丝之前被剥夺的畅快。&lt;/p>;

Various rumors about the current situation of Xu Jiayin, the actual controller of Evergrande Group, have finally come to light. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On September 28, 2023, China Evergrande issued an announcement on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange stating, &quot;The company has received notice from relevant departments that Xu Jiayin, the company&#39;s executive director and chairman of the board of directors, has been detained in accordance with the law for suspected illegal crimes. Take compulsory measures. Trading of the company’s shares on the Stock Exchange will be suspended from 9:00 a.m. on September 28, 2023, and will continue to be suspended until further notice.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A criminal law expert told 21 A reporter from Century Business Herald said that the content of Evergrande Group’s announcement was very clear. According to Evergrande Group&#39;s announcement, the company should have received a definite notice, and the notice characterized Xu Jiayin as &quot;suspected of illegal crimes&quot; and compulsory measures were taken. It is common sense to guess that when there is notification from relevant departments, the coercive measures taken are likely to be different from the &quot;residential surveillance&quot; that has been misreported by overseas media. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The above-mentioned criminal law experts said that in the context of the early stage of the China Securities Regulatory Commission’s investigation into Evergrande Real Estate and the public security departments taking criminal coercive measures against suspected criminals such as Du Mou of Evergrande Fortune, Xu Jiayin was suspected of illegal crimes. The results should not surprise many people. Public opinion has previously focused more on “when” to take action. Judging from the current public information, the issues he is involved in are likely to be related to multiple crimes. They are very complicated and may take quite some time to clarify. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A senior observer in the field of corporate governance told the 21st Century Business Herald reporter that Xu Jiayin had previously publicly declared high-profile slogans such as &quot;No one is allowed to lie flat&quot; and &quot;I can have nothing&quot; in 2021, but comprehensively considering all aspects, Judging from the information and reports, in fact, Xu Jiayin and his company said one thing and did another, tried to &quot;sit down&quot; at every turn, and threw the burden of resolving various problems and contradictions on society, leaving a mess that is difficult to clean up. From this perspective, it is no exaggeration to say that public opinion criticized him verbally and writingly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The above-mentioned observers pointed out that at this cusp of great pressure from all parties, Xu Jiayin was shouting slogans to deceive creditors, but at the same time he had a &quot;silent technical divorce&quot; with Ding Yumei. Due to the agreement of Evergrande Group to be listed in Hong Kong through the &quot;small red chip&quot; structure, among the more than 90 billion Evergrande Group has previously distributed in accumulated dividends, the British Virgin Islands and Cayman Islands are 100% controlled by Xu Jiayin and Ding Yumei respectively. The offshore company received most of the dividends through China Evergrande (03333.HK), and transferred them overseas before and after the accident. Through the &quot;technical divorce&quot; operation, it eventually fell into the pocket of &quot;overseas ex-wife&quot; Ding Yumei. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A senior partner of an accounting firm who is familiar with cross-border restructuring pointed out to the 21st Century Business Herald reporter that at present, Evergrande Group’s overseas debt restructuring may be due to Xu Jiayin and some senior executives being suspected of illegal crimes. The situation faces major changes. But whether it is domestic or overseas, whether the reorganization is successful or liquidated, I believe there are sufficient legal channels for domestic and foreign creditors to safeguard their rights and interests and pursue the responsibilities of Xu Jiayin and others. At the same time, the regulatory authorities are also likely to investigate Xu Jiayin and other executives&#39; illegal violations. The crime and subsequent investigation will be investigated and held accountable in accordance with the law. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 28 Sep 2023 20:55:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[刑事自诉小慧君诽谤立案：孙灏羽的“好运”可以复制吗？丨快评]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257796]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-28 20:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;There is new progress in the &quot;Xiao Huijun&quot; rumor-mongering sexual assault incident. Chidu Company founder Sun Haoyu recently posted on social media that the procedural issues in his criminal private prosecution case against Xiao Huijun for defamation have been resolved and will be heard soon. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the end of 2020, the well-known cross-dressing blogger &quot;Sien Xiaohuijun&quot; publicly accused her former boss Sun Haoyu of sexually harassing her online. Fortunately, Sun Haoyu later obtained evidence to prove that the so-called sexual harassment was just a rumor created by Xiao Huijun in order to terminate the contract with the company at a low cost. Including Xiao Huijun and several other contract anchors under Chidu premeditated and planned this rumor and slander incident in a group. After obtaining the evidence, Sun Haoyu filed a civil lawsuit against Xiao Huijun and others, which was supported by the court. The court clearly stated in the civil judgment that the evidence proved that the alleged sexual harassment was fiction, and ordered Xiao Huijun and others to apologize and compensate for losses to Chidu Company and Sun Haoyu. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Afterwards, Sun Haoyu filed a criminal private prosecution with the court, requesting that Xiao Huijun be held criminally responsible for spreading rumors and defamation. Initially, the court in Xiao Huijun&#39;s place of residence believed that it had no jurisdiction and ruled to dismiss Sun Haoyu&#39;s lawsuit. The higher court ruling published by Sun Haoyu this time determined that the court at Xiao Huijun&#39;s place of residence had jurisdiction and ordered the court to open the case and accept it. At this point, there is no obstacle to filing a criminal case against Xiao Huijun for defamation, and the next step will be to enter the formal trial process. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From being rumored to be sexually assaulted, to winning the civil lawsuit and the court confirming that &quot;Xiao Huijun&quot; spread the rumor, to finally filing a criminal private prosecution case, the journey has been difficult. In view of the frequent occurrence of similar rumors on the Internet, many netizens hope that Xiao Huijun&#39;s case will deter those who try to follow suit. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In recent years, there have been constant incidents of accusing others of sexual harassment or even sexual assault through online essays. However, many of them are difficult to distinguish between true and false, and some have been deemed by judicial authorities as lacking evidence or even being slanderous. For example, a female employee of a well-known large factory alleged that she was raped by a male leader, but police investigation showed that there was no rape. Recently, another host was also accused of rape, and police investigations revealed that the woman suffered from schizophrenia and experienced hallucinations and delusions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For these online essays alleging sexual assault, many netizens often choose to believe the parties involved for the first time. The reason is often that &quot;women will not use their innocence to slander others.&quot; However, many facts prove that in the face of interests, nothing is impossible. For example, Xiao Huijun did not hesitate to sacrifice her &quot;innocence&quot; in order to terminate the contract with Chidu Company at a low cost. There are also some people whose motives for slander are difficult for ordinary people to understand, and they may simply have mental problems. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After Xiao Huijun accused Sun Haoyu of sexual harassment, many netizens believed it to be true. Sun Haoyu and Chidu Company were bullied online and threatened offline. The company&#39;s door and front desk were smashed many times, and Sun Haoyu was always crowded when he went out. Followed by taking pictures and cursing. An MCN organization that was originally at the top of the industry has almost come to a standstill and is now unknown in the industry. A well-known host was at the peak of his career, but after being accused of sexual harassment, he was put into hiding, and his career and reputation were ruined. Although they won the lawsuit, their careers struggled to recover. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is extremely difficult for these men who have been falsely accused to defend their reputations. In civil litigation, it is difficult to obtain evidence recognized by the court. Sun Haoyu was lucky. Someone in Xiao Huijun&#39;s &quot;Blood Battle Chidu&quot; small group found his way back and provided the chat records Sun Haoyu needed. Zhang Heng, another well-known online article author who was falsely accused of raping an underage female fan more than ten years ago, has been unable to obtain the identity of the false accuser through legal channels, let alone prosecute. The accuser just wanted to make a famous person look bad, but he &quot;hidden his fame and achievements&quot; and didn&#39;t even reveal his true identity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Even if the civil lawsuit is won, the compensation received is very little, and the defendant&#39;s apology is often light and perfunctory, and the amount of communication of the apology is also very different from that of the false accusation. , it is difficult to clarify the facts and restore reputation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To deter rumors and defamation, the rumor makers must pay a greater price, such as criminal liability. However, the criminal law stipulates that spreading rumors and defamation is generally a private prosecution crime, and the victim needs to collect evidence and file a lawsuit. It is even difficult for victims to collect evidence for civil lawsuits, and it is even more difficult for criminal evidence that requires stricter requirements than civil lawsuits. Sun Haoyu was just lucky. He got the evidence and the verdict of winning the civil lawsuit, and he had more confidence to file a criminal private prosecution. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But Sun Haoyu’s good luck is difficult to replicate. In order for those who make false accusations and framers to be punished, the threshold for turning false accusations and frame-ups into public prosecutions needs to be lowered. As long as the victim makes a complaint, the case should be turned into public prosecutions and the police will investigate the case and collect evidence. In this way, we can intensify the crackdown on rumors and slander, protect the interests of victims, and maintain online order. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 28 Sep 2023 20:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[杭州亚运会：赛场内外，同样精彩]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257834]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-28 00:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;As of 17:00 on September 27, 2023, the Chinese delegation It is far ahead in the medal list of the Hangzhou Asian Games, with a total of 124 medals, including 69 gold medals, 39 silver medals, and 16 bronze medals. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;On September 24, 2023, Li Bingjie, who won the women&#39;s 1500-meter freestyle final, displayed her medal.&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/ image/23/09/27/ea98f3aa2a.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;721&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/ 27/ea98f3aa2a.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252480&quot;>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On September 24, 2023, won the women&#39;s 1500-meter freestyle final championship Li Bingjie shows her medal. &lt;/p>;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The 19th Asian Games in Hangzhou will be held from September 23 to October 8, 2023, with a total of 15 competition days.

(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;In the past &quot;May Day&quot; and the approaching &quot;National Day&quot;, Dr. Sun from the emergency department of Zibo Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital went on two missions during two consecutive long holidays. In order to protect people from all over the country who came to Zi for barbecue, as a member of the city&#39;s medical security team, he stayed on duty at the makeshift barbecue city for several days during the May Day holiday. The constant flow of people made him, an &quot;Old Zibo&quot;, feel unreal. The outside world kept saying that it was going to be cold, but it was always crowded every time he passed by the popular barbecue spot Ba Daji when he went out. Just like that, half a year passed in a blink of an eye. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;After this summer vacation, the streets have indeed regained some calm, but after a marathon, it is full of people again. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“There will definitely be a wave of traffic during the National Day holiday. This is what it means to hold a marathon at this time.” On September 24, the last weekend before the National Day holiday, this internet celebrity city held its first marathon Marathon. Just after the game ended that day, Dr. Sun gave his prediction for the passenger flow during the National Day holiday. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Because it was held in Zibo, this marathon was nicknamed the &quot;BBQ Marathon&quot; by runners. “As soon as I heard it was the Zibo Marathon, I rushed (to sign up).” After getting off the high-speed train at noon on September 23, Feng Yanhua made an appointment with fellow runners to have a meal. They queued for an hour and a half, and many people in front of the store were carrying Marathon on their backs.

Many interviewees said that after the summer vacation, the market showed obvious signs of calming down. However, whether it will return to its original shape before the epidemic or maintain an average value of warm but not cool, people are still waiting and watching, and it is difficult to tell.

For this reason, businesses and citizens are eager to try to seize this possible &quot;last wave of traffic.&quot; &lt;/p>;&lt;h4>;Barbeque shop owner: Give it a try again on National Day&lt;/h4>;&lt;p>;The obvious &quot;turning point&quot; occurred after the summer vacation. &quot;You can see it all at a glance&quot; on Badaju Street, which is booming. The popularity of Zibo barbecue has dropped after half a year. &quot;It was still very busy in July and August, but after September, it subsided a bit quickly.&quot; Standing at the fork in the traffic flow, whether to advance or retreat, the owner of a barbecue restaurant in Zhangdian District, Zibo City was a little undecided. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Boss Shan’s shop was featured in the documentary &quot;A String of Life&quot;, coupled with the super popularity of &quot;Going to Zi for Barbecue&quot;, the business has been really booming for a long time. “当时都有点崩溃了，人太多了，全店连轴转。”他对南方周末记者说，扩招了不少服务员，工资也从两千八涨到三千，再从三千涨到三千五，&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;获取更多RSS：&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 28 Sep 2023 19:25:02 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
