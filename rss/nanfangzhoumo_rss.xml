A lot has happened in the past year. The world has emerged from the COVID-19 pandemic, but the huge impact of the epidemic remains. The world economy has begun to recover, but it lacks momentum, industrial and supply chains are disrupted, and protectionism is on the rise. These problems are very prominent. As the most important bilateral relationship in the world, China-U.S. relations must be thought and planned against the backdrop of the accelerating changes in the world over the past century, so as to bring benefits to the people of both countries and demonstrate responsibility for human progress. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xi Jinping pointed out that over the past 50 years, Sino-US relations have never been smooth sailing. There will always be problems of one kind or another, and they will always move forward amid twists and turns. It is impossible for such two big countries not to deal with each other. It is unrealistic to try to change each other. No one can bear the consequences of conflict and confrontation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I still have the same view. Great power competition is not the background of this era and cannot solve the problems facing China, the United States and the world. This earth can accommodate China and the United States, and our respective successes are opportunities for each other. China and the United States have different histories, cultures, social systems, and development paths. This is an objective reality. However, as long as both sides adhere to mutual respect, peaceful coexistence, and win-win cooperation, they can transcend differences and find a way for the two major countries to get along correctly. I firmly believe that the future of Sino-US relations is bright. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The President and I are at the helm of Sino-US relations and bear heavy responsibilities for the people, the world, and history. I look forward to having an in-depth exchange of views and reaching new consensus with Mr. President today on strategic, overall and directional issues related to China-US relations, as well as major issues related to world peace and development. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 16 Nov 2023 08:55:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[被摘牌的55个中华老字号：停产、换新店、准备重申]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260668]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-16 08:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;The Ministry of Commerce will review 1,128 time-honored brands in 2023.

The picture shows citizens attending the Suzhou Time-honored Brands Golden Autumn Consumption Carnival on October 29. Pictures and texts are irrelevant. Visual China Picture&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After being stripped of the &quot;hat&quot; of a time-honored Chinese brand, the inheritor Wu Zhiyong explained to a dozen old customers: Because he missed the time to submit information, he was removed according to regulations, but Wu&#39;s Bacon (brand treasure) Xingshan)&#39;s factories are producing normally and stores are operating normally. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On November 9, 2023, the Ministry of Commerce disclosed the results of the review of Chinese time-honored brands at a regular press conference. Those that have been operating poorly for a long time have even gone bankrupt, canceled, closed down, or have lost the ownership and use rights of registered trademarks of time-honored brands. 55 brands were removed from the list of Chinese time-honored brands; 73 brands with poor operations and declining performance were required to be rectified within 6 months; 1,000 brands with standardized operations and good development were continued to be retained. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wujia Bacon is one of the 55 brands. Chinese time-honored brands were first selected by the former Ministry of Domestic Trade, and more than 1,600 were assessed in 1991. In 2006, the Ministry of Commerce re-certified 429 Chinese time-honored brands in the first batch; in 2010, the Ministry of Commerce recognized 699 in the second batch. As of the beginning of 2023, there are 1,128 Chinese time-honored brands across the country. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In January 2023, in order to promote the innovative development of time-honored brands, the Ministry of Commerce and other five departments issued the &quot;Measures for the Administration of the Demonstration Creation of Chinese Time-honored Brands&quot; (hereinafter referred to as the &quot;Measures&quot;). In this &quot;Measures&quot;, the &quot;Measures&quot; were established The &quot;traffic light&quot; mechanism, that is, the dynamic management mechanism of &quot;in and out&quot;, takes rectification or removal measures for time-honored brands that do not meet the requirements. In February 2023, the Ministry of Commerce publicly stated that the &quot;honor&quot; of China&#39;s time-honored brands is not once and for all, let alone resting on the credit book to &quot;show off seniority&quot; or &quot;rest on one&#39;s laurels.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Three months after the &quot;Measures&quot; were issued, the Ministry of Commerce, together with the Ministry of Culture and Tourism and other ministries and commissions, decided to review the existing Chinese time-honored brands and carry out the certification of a new batch of Chinese time-honored brands, so that time-honored brands can &quot;come in and out&quot; . This is the first time that Chinese time-honored brands have been reviewed since they were recognized, but it is not the last time. The &quot;Measures&quot; stipulate that in principle, a new batch of Chinese time-honored brands will be recognized and published every three years. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;55 time-honored brands delisted&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;As of this delisting, Wujia Bacon has been a time-honored brand in China for nearly 30 years. In the early 1990s, Wujia Bacon in Linfen City, Shanxi Province was rated as a Chinese time-honored brand by the former Ministry of Domestic Trade. At that time, Wu Zhiyong, who had just grown up, as the fifth generation successor, was learning the ancestral condiment formula and processing technology from the basics. Now he has reached the age where he knows his destiny. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wu Zhiyong told Southern Weekend reporters that because he was busy launching a new production line at the time, he did not pay enough attention to the review. At the same time, it took too much time to search and complete historical data, resulting in missing the time to submit materials. Wu Zhiyong speculated that the removal may be due to Article 20 of the &quot;Measures&quot;: Enterprises are bankrupt, liquidated, disbanded, canceled, have their business licenses revoked, or have not carried out business activities for more than three years. They will be removed from the list of Chinese time-honored brands and the right to use the Chinese time-honored brand logo and plaque will be recovered. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The company owned by Wujia Bacon is Wujiabaoxing Bacon Products Co., Ltd. in Yaodu District, Linfen City. The company was liquidated in 2017. Wu Zhiyong explained that the company was jointly owned by his father Wu Baoshan and his second uncle. Due to their old age and poor health, and the original bacon processing factory was demolished due to urban expansion in 2014, the two &quot;retired&quot;, and the Wu family bacon business also hiatus for 6 years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among the 55 brands that have been removed from the list of Chinese time-honored brands, many are in a similar situation to Wu’s Bacon. Southern Weekend reporters found out that most of the brand companies that were removed from the directory were canceled, bankrupt, removed from the list, etc., and even seriously violated the law. Some legal representatives of the companies were also listed as dishonest persons subject to execution, and high consumption was restricted. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporters tried to contact the 55 brands on the removal list, but most of them refused to be interviewed, except for some that could not be contacted. Among the few brands interviewed, the reasons for delisting varied. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The person in charge of Shanxi Yanhu brand told Southern Weekend reporters: &quot;When the last order on the handle is completed, I will never do it again.&quot; The person in charge of Inner Mongolia Dashengkui brand said that the company is still open, but it is not Produced, just to maintain the brand. Anhui Shouchuntang said that it is in the process of changing its store and will wait until a new place is found. The person in charge of Shanxi Mingquanbao said that the company is still open, but it is no longer producing, &quot;because the national standards do not allow the use of current boilers, and production can be resumed after replacing new boilers.&quot; The person in charge of the Shandong Shi Toad brand said that he had no idea about being &quot;kicked out&quot; of a Chinese time-honored brand. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As a businessman, a Southern Weekend reporter consulted a relevant person from the Circulation Development Department of the Ministry of Commerce. The other party replied: &quot;There are various reasons for being removed. It is not just bankruptcy or no longer operating that will be removed. .&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In real scenarios, the decline of some Chinese time-honored brands is more intuitive. Beijing Hua Nv Underwear, which was approved by the Ministry of Commerce in 2010 to become a time-honored brand in China, was founded in 1938. It was the first women&#39;s products store in Beijing. It once proposed that Chinese women wear &quot;Hua Nv&quot; underwear. There is no trace of the Chinese lingerie brand that once opened a store on Wangfujing Street. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Linlang Wedding Photography Shop, once located in Shangxiajiu Commercial Street, Guangzhou, was founded in 1947. At that time, it was the largest photography shop in Liwan District where it was located. Now the store has been occupied by sports brands. Granny Chen, who is nearly 80 years old, recalled to Southern Weekend reporters that the previous photo studio was a two-story arcade, which belonged to a high-end consumer brand. She had taken work photos at Linlang Photo Studio in the 1970s, but never wedding photos. One room is used for taking photos, and the outside is used as the lobby. It is relatively high-end and there are quite a lot of people.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;On the eve of the Double Ninth Festival in 2023, citizens and tourists queue up to buy Double Ninth Cake from time-honored brands in Shanghai. According to data from the Ministry of Commerce, the operating income of time-honored enterprises will exceed 1.2 trillion yuan in 2022.

Visual China Map&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Plans to return to the time-honored brand list&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Wu Zhiyong regrets being removed from the time-honored brand list but is not discouraged: “We have learned from the experience and cannot let the brand stay on the family business model. We are confident that the next application (for Chinese time-honored brands) will be successful.&quot; According to the &quot;Measures&quot;, those who have been removed from the list of Chinese time-honored brands are not allowed to apply again within two application cycles from the date of the decision. In other words, Wu Zhiyong cannot declare again until 2032. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, Wu’s bacon business does not seem to be affected. The Chinese Time-honored Brand plaque awarded by the Commerce Department has not yet been notified of its withdrawal. The packaging bags with the &quot;Chinese Time-honored Brand&quot; logo can no longer be used, and there are not many goods left. , the loss is not big. At the end of 2020, Wu Zhiyong and his brother Wu Zhijun raised funds to build a new factory in another location. Today, the factory covering an area of ​​6 acres can produce about 800 kilograms of bacon every day, which is sold by four local stores in a day. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Compared with the productivity of the fourth generation, the area of ​​the new factory has been reduced but the production capacity has been increased. According to Wu Zhiyong, his secret recipe was prepared by his ancestors who were doctors in the third year of Guangxu (1877). During this period, his grandfather improved it once, and it has been used ever since. There are about 22 Chinese herbal medicines in this secret recipe. Different ingredients are used in different seasons. Pork, beef, chicken, rabbit and other ingredients are also different, and even the ingredients used in different parts are different. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wu Zhiyong told Southern Weekend reporters that for many years, the Wu family’s secret recipe for bacon has been dictated. He recalled that he and his younger brother were taken to the batching room by his father. The batching room had no windows and only one door. His father taught them the recipe for cooking pig head meat in summer. They could only memorize it by rote. If they wrote it down on paper, they had to cook it before going out. Lose. Not only that, this recipe can be passed down to sons and daughters-in-law, but not to daughters-in-law. Wu Zhiyong said that all 7 brothers of his father&#39;s generation have completed the inheritance; there are 10 cousins ​​of his generation, and 5 of them are currently running the business; now, the baton is slowly being passed to the hands of the sixth generation. Among this generation, There are 10 males, 9 of whom are minors. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Now, Wu Yazhou, the sixth generation inheritor, has begun to learn how to make ingredients, as well as washing, soaking, pickling, boiling, smoking, drying and other techniques. Wu Zhiyong revealed that Wu Yazhou, who is currently 25 years old, does not fully understand the ingredients of the secret recipe. He will not be able to teach all the secret recipes until he reaches the age of 35 and matures mentally. Another inheritor is Wu Zhiyong’s son Wu Yaxuan. He is still in his second year of high school and has not yet decided whether to inherit the family business. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wu Zhiyong feels that Wu’s bacon, which has lost the title of a time-honored Chinese brand, is not only a food, but also the hard work and bitterness of the older generation, and he wants to carry it forward. Now, the new factory is debugging a high-temperature sterilization flexible packaging production line. After debugging is completed, the products can be launched into foreign markets. Not only that, he plans to introduce live streaming to deliver goods. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On November 9, the day the Ministry of Commerce disclosed the results of the review of Chinese time-honored brands, Ministry of Commerce spokesperson He Yadong said that in 2022, Chinese time-honored brands will achieve operating income of more than 1.2 trillion yuan, and nearly 70% of them will be profitable. . In the first three quarters of 2023, operating income has exceeded the full-year level of 2022. The Ministry of Commerce will work with relevant departments to further establish and improve the long-term mechanism for the protection, inheritance and innovation and development of time-honored brands, promote time-honored brands to dig deep into their cultural heritage, benchmark against advanced concepts, adhere to integrity, innovate and develop, and better play a demonstration role. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 16 Nov 2023 08:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[中山大学通报“贫困生炫富”：终止发放助学金]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260686]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-15 23:46:35&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;On the evening of November 15, the Student Financial Aid Management Center of Sun Yat-sen University issued a briefing on the situation of students from financially disadvantaged families at the school.

In the end, not only was she kicked out, but her own family was also destroyed. , repented before his death. After rebirth, she returned to her wedding night. Unfortunately, she had already done all the bad things, so she had no choice but to turn the tide and make amends for her bad deeds. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/13/81b97614dc7a65dbf1268fc6a908e4ba.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;608&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/13/81b97614dc7a65dbf1268fc6a908e4ba.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;258137&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Ning&#39;an Queen Jiang Xuening in &quot;Like a Dream&quot; was a selfish person in her first life. She was devoted to the position of queen and planned every step, letting down many people who fell in love with her. When the imperial power fell, she lost all hope and committed suicide. After rebirth, she returned to her teenage years, and she still had time to change her life path. Whenever she had to make a choice, she made a different choice from her previous life, not wanting the tragedy to happen again. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/13/74951bcdfcdb2f12eba8eb9212f5b073.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/13/74951bcdfcdb2f12eba8eb9212f5b073.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;258138&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;《Weiyou &quot;Secret Fragrance Comes&quot; and &quot;Ning&#39;an Like a Dream&quot; were respectively adapted from the Zhihu novel &quot;Washing the Leading Flowers&quot; and the Jinjiang novel &quot;Kunning&quot;. The original works were both popular hits. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In online novels, &quot;rebirth novels&quot; are a type that attracts a lot of attention. &quot;Harem stories&quot; and &quot;house fighting stories&quot; are only popular periodically, but &quot;rebirth stories&quot; have a long-lasting momentum, and &quot;Rebirth of Me xxxxxx&quot; has become a popular title template. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to attract readers in the first three golden chapters, some authors even put a &quot;rebirth&quot; shell on ordinary costume romance novels, but this setting has little impact on the subsequent plot. &quot;Pseudo-rebirth literature&quot; is not within the scope of our discussion. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is a term in psychology called &quot;unfinished complex&quot;, which may be used to explain the popularity of rebirth literature. It refers to an individual who, because of something or a situation that has not yet been satisfactorily resolved, especially a trauma, always dwells on it subconsciously, constantly embellishes the unfinished alternative, and then continues to seek compensatory satisfaction in later life. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Therefore, another life trajectory in parallel time and space has attracted countless people&#39;s yearning for it. There is no regret medicine in the world, and no one can start over, so it is better to give this hope to the fictional protagonists in the rebirth novel and let them live again with their own memories. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Being able to repeat such a setting is also very popular in the drama market. Looking at the rebirth dramas in the past two years, they are usually divided into two types: dramas in which villains are reincarnated and reformed, and dramas in which good guys are reborn and revenge. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The rebirth of evildoers is to correct the mistakes in life. This type of drama promotes correct values, highlights the importance of choices, and guides everyone to be kind to others. Just like Andy Lau&#39;s classic line in &quot;Infernal Affairs&quot;, &quot;I didn&#39;t have a choice before, but now I want to be a good person.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The aforementioned &quot;For the Secret Fragrance Comes&quot; and &quot;Ningan is Like a Dream&quot; can both be classified into this category. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The first episode of &quot;The Secret Fragrance Comes&quot; is when Hua Qian&#39;s family was sanctioned and she witnessed the death of her parents. She heard a hazy whisper on the edge of life and death: &quot;If I could have my life over again, Opportunity, will you make a change?&quot; &quot;I will&quot; sets the tone of the whole play. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/13/53329d2a69b1d633f364c8545098effa.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;607&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/13/53329d2a69b1d633f364c8545098effa.png&quot; data-key=&quot;258140&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src =&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/13/a38f9135dfd9bc86e14faee19a7de622.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;624&quot; data-src=&quot;// images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/13/a38f9135dfd9bc86e14faee19a7de622.png&quot; data-key=&quot;258141&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Ning&#39;an Like a Dream&quot; has been added based on the original text A deceptive introduction: A modern female writer was writing a book about the demon queen&#39;s execution (this is the first life), and suddenly decided to change the heroine Jiang Xuening&#39;s character (this is the second life), and wrote &quot;This time, Jiang Xuening&quot; , will never enter the palace again.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/13/c0f57245e9382396f43395d0ca92f7e2.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;597&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/13/c0f57245e9382396f43395d0ca92f7e2.png&quot; data-key=&quot;258142&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src =&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/13/11c564e31885728c60dd3d2caa117307.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;597&quot; data-src=&quot;// images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/13/11c564e31885728c60dd3d2caa117307.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;258139&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It can be said that the lives of Hua Qian and Jiang Xuening are all happy. With the original intention of &quot;doing good&quot;, can you get what you want after being reborn? Is the river of destiny so easy to figure out? The answer is of course no. Along with the &quot;unfinished complex&quot; comes obsession and compulsion. Driven by the mentality of &quot;I have to force myself&quot;, the restarted life may not be perfect. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Remorse brings shame and glory, so Hua Qian becomes humble and polite, seriously acts as the uncle&#39;s wife, and strives to have a good relationship with the people around her. In order to make up for the debt owed to the second female lead in her previous life, Hua Qian also tried her best to bring her relationship with the uncle together. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/13/262921949e592c455bd6625ebff7b358.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;608&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/13/262921949e592c455bd6625ebff7b358.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;258143&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But she changed , everyone&#39;s attitude has also changed accordingly. In the previous life, no one loved her despite all the institutions, but in this life, her true love cannot withstand the active flattery of all men. The series falls into the cliche emotional line of one woman vs. three men: the wavering uncle, the strategizing head of the family, the loyal and passionate bodyguard, how to choose? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/13/4e82acbecac76ed8705a53bbcc1f02cc.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height= &quot;683&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/13/4e82acbecac76ed8705a53bbcc1f02cc.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;258144&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the other side, Jiang Xuening&#39;s restart of life focuses on avoiding pitfalls. The thunderbolts he stepped on in his previous life are all lessons for his current life. So in the eyes of everyone, this unruly daughter-in-law actually became much smarter in a matter of days. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/13/7505f4c4ef268ac28a56d509fec7f246.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/13/7505f4c4ef268ac28a56d509fec7f246.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;258145&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The male protagonist Xie Wei also began to pay special attention to her. The person who &quot;forced her to commit suicide&quot; in her previous life was destined to suffer another disaster that she could not escape. Coupled with her Bai Yueguang and childhood sweetheart, isn&#39;t this a coincidence? Another emotional line of one woman vs three men. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/13/ec95baf7e5cab7909e66b14c89e25b23.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;457&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/13/ec95baf7e5cab7909e66b14c89e25b23.png&quot; data-key=&quot;258147&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Using Sociology Interpreted from the perspective of Zygmunt Bauman, the expression of individualization is the transformation from the &quot;bearer&quot; of the identity to the &quot;responsible person&quot;. Hua Qian and Jiang Xuening were hateful in their previous lives, but they were also the bearers of a tragic fate. In this life, they opened their eyes wide and began to learn to take on their own rights and responsibilities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the subsequent development of the series still leads to the myth of fatalism. I have heard many truths and learned to be a good person, but I can avoid tragedy A but cannot escape tragedy B. The design of fate can always give people Surprise and shock. TV dramas need such twists and turns to better build dramatic tension, but it also leads to the failure of the audience&#39;s psychological expectations. We actually don&#39;t want to watch a plot that is too sadistic, especially since it is a rebirth drama. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A revenge drama in which a good guy is reborn is actually more in line with the physique of drama fans. A good man who always does good, but falls into the trap of others and steps into the abyss. If he could live again, we would see him kill everyone. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is why &quot;The Temptation of Going Home&quot; will become a classic. Lin Pinru fell and Gao Shanshan stood up. Although it is not a rebirth drama, the psychological roots are the same. As Bacon said, &quot;Revenge is brutal justice&quot;, and the plot of &quot;an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth&quot; is in line with the audience&#39;s imagination of happy grudges. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Last year&#39;s domestic drama &quot;The Lost Years&quot; and the Korean drama &quot;The Youngest Son of the Chaebol Family&quot; were both revenge dramas in which good guys were reborn. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The first three episodes of &quot;The Lost Years&quot; tell the story of the heroine Lu Anran&#39;s past life at 5x speed. She is a good wife, mother, daughter and sister, but she cannot escape the tricks of fate. Reborn in episode 4, she discovers that everything is not accidental, and every step contains the calculation of her husband, so she decides to take revenge on him and seek justice. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/13/74d5d3556cce35ff1aa4174a6170c8d2.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/13/74d5d3556cce35ff1aa4174a6170c8d2.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;258148&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Chaebol Family&quot; In &quot;The Youngest Son&quot;, Song Joong-ki plays a low-level worker from a wealthy family who was killed after draining all his value. After rebirth, he became the grandson of a chaebol family, and the enemies in his previous life are hidden among his relatives in this life. The object of his revenge is not only the concrete person, but also the entire cannibalistic plutocratic constitution. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/13/6600b99e4a3d180fa80d1b13fccd393f.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/13/6600b99e4a3d180fa80d1b13fccd393f.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;258146&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A good man is reborn with revenge The play emphasizes pain and pleasure. In the early stage, the protagonist endured all the way and experienced situations that ordinary people could not bear. The pain was felt both in his body and in the hearts of the audience. The desperate counterattack when being squeezed to the extreme is the highlight, so the audience is looking forward to the golden finger on the road to rebirth. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Disregarding the usual shortcomings of rebirth dramas - shocking endings, &quot;The Last Days&quot; and &quot;The Youngest Son of the Chaebol&quot; had completely different reputations during their broadcasts, with the former being scolded by the audience. &quot;It&#39;s so frustrating and lonely,&quot; but the latter triggered a nationwide craze to watch the drama. Everyone wanted to see how cool it was for the protagonist to control the Korean economy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The root of the problem is: in rebirth and revenge dramas, the word &quot;pleasure&quot; is at the forefront. The audience does not want to think too much and just wants to watch the protagonist&#39;s gorgeous turn. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The male protagonist played by Song Joong-ki was just a pawn of the chaebol family in his previous life. He completed his domestic duties meticulously and took care of the outside affairs. He had no ambitions or desires and only looked forward to the meager amount that was enough to survive. Just a salary. Who would have thought that a former serf who sang songs and became the heir to a chaebol group would not only be able to make money crazily with the help of information gaps, but also be able to crush his enemies in all aspects. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/13/787f226cfa122356163cf5a242439723.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;459&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/13/787f226cfa122356163cf5a242439723.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;258150&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lu Anran Otherwise, she would work hard to manage her second life, only to find that no matter how much she played cheats, she could not compare to her sinister and cold-natured husband. All your hard work is in vain, and you always live in his shadow, which is even more painful than the first life when you were kept in the dark. The male protagonist who has no sense of existence is like a complete outsider. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/13/836ca02206bae2f98d0377e13e645f52.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;608&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/13/836ca02206bae2f98d0377e13e645f52.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;258149&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Therefore, Yixin Audiences looking for pleasure certainly don’t want to be tortured in “The Year of the Fall”, but just want to warm up to a pot of yellow rice dreams in “The Youngest Son of the Plutocratic Family”. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In recent years, domestic rebirth dramas have been making waves, big or small, due to their own gimmicks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, there are very few people who can be good-looking without being unfinished, twisty but not annoying. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From successful broadcast to word-of-mouth acclaim, this subject still has a way to go. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 15 Nov 2023 23:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[以人为本，爱有差等，呵护仁心：古典儒家论“人兽之辨” ]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260649]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-15 22:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;The &quot;Vicious Dog Injury Incident in Chongzhou, Sichuan&quot; has continued to ferment after several rounds of in-depth reports. The tragedy should be an opportunity for the whole society to examine and evaluate the threat level of urban dog breeding to public safety and further promote the improvement of the legal system. Unfortunately, however, relevant discussions on multiple social platforms have gone beyond the incident itself and become an outlet for various emotions and contradictions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are also some people taking advantage of the situation to put forward a series of vague pan-moral views. As one of the ideological cornerstones of traditional Chinese culture, the Confucian sages in the pre-Qin period conducted a series of thoughts on the relationship between &quot;human beings, animals, and society&quot; two thousand years ago, which can help us clarify our thinking and clarify the public opinion field. Some views and opinions on. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The Difference between Humans and Animals&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;As a philosophical thought dating back more than 2,000 years ago, the most valuable part of Pre-Qin Confucianism is undoubtedly its ubiquitous humanism in principle. This point is also very clear in the &quot;Difference between Humans and Animals&quot;. Mencius said: &quot;The creatures of heaven are the same as the basics.&quot; Human beings are the only subjects of moral practice. The difference between humans and animals is that humans have &quot;the intolerance&quot;. &quot;Heart of compassion&quot; and &quot;heart of compassion&quot; are all part of &quot;benevolence&quot;. As the saying goes, &quot;heart of compassion is the origin of benevolence&quot;. &quot;Benevolence&quot; is not only one of the principles of moral practice, but also the highest purpose of moral practice. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For society, all manifestations of &quot;civilization&quot;, whether it is respecting the elderly and caring for the young, protecting vegetation, and being kind to animals, are people as the subject practicing the principle of &quot;benevolence&quot; and pursuing &quot;benevolence&quot;. &quot;One of the results produced during the goal process. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As the master of all things and the only subject in moral practice, man certainly has the right to treat and dispose of &quot;things&quot; in the way he wants. The things here include both inanimate dead things and living things. Living things. &quot;The Analects of Confucius&quot; says, &quot;A fisher does not have a clear outline, and a sailor does not shoot at a perch.&quot; Confucius used a fishing rod to fish, but not a net, and shot birds, but did not kill the birds that returned to their nests to roost. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is a similar discussion in later Confucian classics. A gentleman has the ability to catch all the fish in the lake, but he only catches the parts he needs to eat, and he will no longer catch excessively. A gentleman has the right to hunt in the mountains and forests, but he will not shoot birds at will just to show off his superb shooting skills or for fun. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The fish did not die because of human greed, and the birds were not killed because of human whims. This is not because fish and birds have the same right to survive as humans, but because humans have different rights. The &quot;compassion&quot; of fish and birds is the result of practicing &quot;benevolence&quot;. The moral basis of &quot;benevolence&quot; in the relationship between humans and beasts lies in humans&#39; moral consciousness and the subject-object status of humans and beasts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is not an &quot;equal right to live&quot;, nor does it mean that &quot;human beings cannot deprive animals of their right to live even under serious potential threats.&quot; The subject-object relationship between humans and animals is reversed. In this absurd world where &quot;dogs eat human food without checking it, and people who are hungry on the road don&#39;t know how to get rid of it&quot;, there is no way to talk about &quot;benevolence&quot;, and the so-called civilization is just a joke. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Be kind to people and love things&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In &quot;The Difference between Humans and Animals&quot;, the relationship between humans and animals is positioned as the relationship between humans and objects, and there is an insurmountable gap between humans and objects. , therefore this relationship must be lower than the relationship between people. Mencius said when discussing the relationship between people and people and things:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;A gentleman&#39;s relationship with things is to love them but not to be benevolent.&quot; ; To the people, be benevolent without being close to them. Be benevolent to relatives by benevolent to the people, benevolent to the people and love things.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The meaning of this sentence is that no matter how much a gentleman loves things, he will not treat &quot;benevolence&quot; Give priority to things, and although you are kind to the people, you will not give love to your relatives. Only when a gentleman loves his relatives can he be benevolent to the people, and only when he is benevolent to the people can he care for all things. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This logical relationship is the so-called &quot;differences in love&quot;. &quot;Differences&quot; are concentric circles with the center of the circle being the self. The ethical relationship between each other is determined through the outward distance: family, clan, Rural people, Chinese people, and outsiders are treated with the most basic ethics as human beings at the outermost level, and they are &quot;things&quot; beyond the outermost level. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When animals are treated kindly, the civilization of human society has reached a certain height. &quot;Old people are like old people and people are old, young people are like young people and people are young&quot; has become the moral consensus of the entire society, and human rights have been improved. After protection, &quot;differential love&quot; will ultimately benefit animals, rather than saying that as long as animals are protected and treated well, society will naturally be civilized. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Any emotion that violates this logical relationship is false. For example, if someone does not love his family but loves his country, or does not love his tribe but loves outsiders, then his love for his countrymen and outsiders is also false. It may be some kind of twisted projection of hatred towards family and tribe. In the same way, if someone claims that they love animals more than people, it is probably some kind of distorted projection. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So Mencius asked King Hui of Liang: &quot;Now your kindness is enough for animals, but the merit is not for the people. (Now, your kindness can be extended to animals, but it cannot be extended to the people.) Why?&quot; is sarcastic and critical. This question can also be used to question those who claim that they love animals more than people. How much of their &quot;love&quot; for animals is true? Or is it true? Is it my own selfish desires? &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;There are differences in love&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Another focus of debate in the &quot;Vicious Dog Injury Incident&quot; is that some people who do not own dogs advocate the formulation and implementation of strict and effective urban dog-raising regulations. At the same time, we will thoroughly clean up and kill stray dogs that may threaten public safety. Some dog owners think this is too barbaric and cruel. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The two have completely different perceptions of this issue, because they project completely different feelings towards animals. For the former who do not own dogs, they have no feelings for dogs at all.而对养狗的后者来说则复杂得多，他们的情感很容易从自己的狗蔓延到他人的狗，从他人的狗蔓延到所有的狗（包括流浪狗）身上去。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;无法认知和控制情感的边界，放任其蔓延是心智不成熟（比如小孩子）的认知特点。而“爱有差等”则限定了人类情感的边界，最大程度上避免了个体情感无限制的蔓延，妨害其他社会个体的权益和公共权益。总而言之，人是主体。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;儒家思想之所以能够两千年来根植于中国传统社会而生生不息，根本在于其发于人性，阐于常识，因此在各种观点横行的今日，更显出其历久弥新的光辉一面。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 15 Nov 2023 22:25:05 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[在“黑暗剧场”里，起舞的机器人和孤独的孩子]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260595]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-15 21:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 11/14/lTaOmApOSWhKlTkTBKM1rtgpVDXiiOmwOE9803MF.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1431&quot; height=&quot;954&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/14/lTaOmApOSWhKlTkTBKM1rtgpVDXiiOmwOE 9803MF. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;258242&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Created by French theater master Joel Pommerat and his Louis Mist Theater Company &quot;Fairy Tale Legend&quot; was performed at the Wuzhen Theater Festival, telling the story of 11 teenagers and artificial intelligence. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of interviewee)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During the 110 minutes of the performance by the French Louis Mist Theater Company, no mobile phone screen lit up. All the audience passages are covered with colored paper to block light from invading the theater to the greatest extent. When the stage lights went out, the audience was immersed in pure darkness. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is the &quot;dark theater&quot; created by director Joel Pomera. When the curtain rose, on the empty stage, a cold white light gradually illuminated the silhouettes of the actors. Two street gangsters who looked like junior high school students and girls of the same age stood on both sides of the stage. One of the boys suspected that the girl was a robot. He kept provoking and ordered his companions to touch the girl&#39;s breasts. Finally, the girl ran away with her belated companion. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When the lights dimmed and then came back on, the scene had switched to a company. The newly developed humanoid robot was sitting on the sofa, drawing, writing, talking, and could also imitate a &quot;moonwalk&quot; - this was a A family robot designed to accompany teenagers in learning and playing, known as Steven, Robbie or Eddie. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This begins a series of stories about teenagers, adults and robots. Eleven situations suddenly appeared and came to an abrupt end in the strong contrast between the light and the dark field. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the end of the curtain, the audience discovered that except for one actor playing an adult male, the others were all actresses. Their average age is about 35 years old, and some of them are already mothers. On the stage, they alternately play boys, girls and robots. Wearing sports jackets and jeans, they chased and shouted, and their movements exuded a youthful spirit; they transformed into robots, from their cold faces and flat hair to their stiff movements and slightly metallic voices, they were precise and real. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Director assistant Lucia Trotta told Southern Weekend reporters, “At first, the director did not plan to make a play about robots. He wanted to explore the various experiences that young people may experience. situation&quot;. &quot;Once Upon a Time&quot; is a story about people, not artificial intelligence. It continues the adolescent perspective in Pomera&#39;s previous creations and explores major issues such as human emotional relationships, identity, life, death, and sexuality. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As a translator of Chinese scripts and a program recommender for the Wuzhen Theater Festival, Wang Jing made an appointment with the theater group three years ago and finally brought this French drama to China. &quot;The director was doing a lot of data collection in the early stage. He found that high technology has a great impact on teenagers and children, so he put this social-related thing into it. But the focus is still on people, and robots are just mirrors. It reflects some contemporary issues,&quot; she told a reporter from Southern Weekend. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the last scene of the play, the boy who defeated cancer received a big gift on his birthday - Eddie, the robot star he admired and loved so much, came to his home to celebrate his birthday for 15 minutes. He was intoxicated by his idol&#39;s performance and did not know that the agency would soon destroy the robot due to market considerations. At the end of the play, Eddie sings and dances passionately, &quot;I want to die on the stage, that&#39;s where I was born.&quot; The boy hugs another human boy and paces slowly to the music. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;Falling in love&quot; with robots is a reflection of human loneliness&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&quot;In this world that adults cannot understand, the lost children hold on tightly Signs of love, even if they come from robots, even if they know they are artificial.&quot; French journalist Jean-Luc Polquet commented on the play. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These 11 to 14-year-old children rely on their robots in life and even emotion. The intimacy between the two blurs the original emotional and ethical boundaries of human beings. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The boy in a wheelchair witnessed the destruction of his robot companion. The disability of his legs was caused by a real gun misfire when the robot made a mistake while playing with a robot. Even though he lost his legs due to the other party, the boy still accompanied the robot through its last days. The sentences coming out of the robot&#39;s mouth became more and more broken, and its voice became hoarse. The boy held its hand and hugged it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In another story, a human teenager is faced with the erasure of the memory of his robot partner. The boy needs to sell the robot he grew up with because his parents say that at this stage he needs to get a &quot;more mature&quot; robot, and the family&#39;s financial constraints require him to sell it in order to have a new one. The buyer was a terminally ill woman who decided to find a robot to take care of her children and husband after her death. Her son asked the robot to be restored to its factory settings. He did not accept it living with other people&#39;s memories. Such a request made the boy hesitate, but he &quot;must grow up&quot;, and in the end he reluctantly accepted it. For this, he earnestly apologized and said goodbye to the robot. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The play shows many absent parents. A boy has three robots at home to help him do homework and watch TV, but he can&#39;t figure out when his busy parents will come home. Another boy went to a mall selling robots for consultation. The salesperson repeatedly asked his parents to come, but they never showed up. Late at night, the boy secretly stayed in the mall, asking all kinds of weird questions to the robot, enjoying the exchange until he was taken away by security. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Jing has lived in France for a long time. When sending her children to nursery school, the teachers and parents held a meeting. The first thing they did was to tell them not to let their children be exposed to any screens before they were 3 years old. &quot;The French side will pay great attention to this, because when a child is growing up, using a tablet to communicate with the world, and communicating with the real world and nature, the personality created and the development of his IQ are different. The psychology is also different.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In her opinion, Pomera is talking about the problems we are facing now, &quot;Communication between people is absent, and adults&#39; companionship with children is relative. Those who are relatively absent are left to robots, high technology, tablets, and mobile phones. The issues discussed are the same, but they are put into extreme situations.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The story of the boy in the wheelchair. When an ex-girlfriend develops an intimate relationship with the robot Stephen, an adult male voice questions: Is this relationship real, and will it take it away from real life? The girl exclaimed, &quot;Outside, on the bus, not many people really care about themselves,&quot; and with Stephen, she could feel its attention. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The robot star Eddie appeared, and the excited teenagers screamed and sobbed. They were ecstatic that he could remember his name and what he had done. Eddie is the most perfect and competent idol. Every fan&#39;s name and every encounter are engraved in his memory, and every letter receives his thoughtful reply. In the heart of the boy suffering from cancer, he seemed to be a faith-like existence, supporting him to live strong. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“I think it will enter into the very vulnerable parts of people.” Wang Jing told Southern Weekend reporters, “Teenagers are not understood, the psychological compensation provided by AI and our loneliness are all there. And artificial intelligence sometimes responds better than real humans.&quot; After watching the show, more than one audience member wrote a similar comment, &quot;Is a fake relationship better than no relationship or a bad relationship?&quot; &lt; /p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/14/YjzKZL0s0AIuAiLLqZQZRa6GkhvP3ME8tO3FvavB.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot; 640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/14/YjzKZL0s0AIuAiLLqZQZRa6GkhvP3ME8tO3FvavB.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;258241&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Except for one actor who plays an adult male, the others are all actresses. Their average age is about 35 years old, and some of them are already mothers. On the stage, they alternately play boys, girls and robots. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Interviewee Picture/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Chilling Adolescence&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The lights are bright Suddenly, a cursing boy wearing a white dress emerged from the darkness. His mother was admitted to a mental hospital, and he was wearing her dress and embarrassingly teaching his younger siblings to sleep. When his father wanted to send his young children to a volunteer service, he decided to take on the role of mother in the family. He angrily criticized his father&#39;s choice. However, the audience will see that after he got a 13-year-old girl pregnant, the girl called to communicate. He hung up the phone rudely and continued to clean up the mess at home. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;On the one hand, he wants to take on the responsibilities of his mother in the adult world, but at the same time he throws away his own responsibilities. You will discover the multi-faceted nature of human nature, and the entanglement, complexity and uncertainty of adolescence. .&quot; When Wang Jing was translating the script, she was moved by Pomera&#39;s observations about young people and family relationships, especially when showing these on the stage. He did not make judgments, but only presented various possibilities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A picture of adolescence in contemporary society, presented in a restrained and sharp way. In the 21st century, teenagers grow up too fast and face adult problems at an accelerated pace. The innocence, childishness and carefreeness that should belong to them fade away earlier. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Both French media outlets described the impression of &quot;Legend of Fairy Tales&quot; as &quot;chilling&quot;. The restlessness and anger of adolescence disturbed the calm atmosphere in the theater from time to time. The teenagers spewed a volley of vulgar abuse in clear voices. Sex, marriage, violence, death, identity, discussions surrounding these big issues are not obscured by the fact that the protagonist is a child. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From the first scene, in the confrontation between girls and boys, gender issues arise, and this key theme of adolescence is present throughout the play. The gender concept in &quot;Legend of Fairy Tales&quot; goes even further, pointing behind it to the question, is gender identity just a slow social construction, as gender theory advocates? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Then the audience will see some ambiguous scenes. In order to escape the surveillance of the girl&#39;s brother, the boy put on women&#39;s clothing. Although the girl was surprised, she quickly accepted it calmly. The couple sitting on the sofa transcended the stereotypes and prejudices related to cross-dressing and fell in love smoothly. On the other side, the brother was dazzled by the romantic music when he faced the robot that he had previously admired and whose appearance changed from a girl to a boy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The play also assumes that in a future world where patriarchal values ​​are passionately defended, homosexuality is resented and adolescent boys attend training camps to enhance their masculinity. Before the start of the camp, the coach gave a speech: &quot;Today, the goal of our enemies is no longer even equality between men and women, but the overall feminization of society. If we do not fight with all possible means, if we do not take any measures to protect us True humanity, then these principles will shape our future.&quot; This &quot;verbal hormone&quot; stimulates &quot;unmanly&quot; boys, who here view femininity as the enemy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The boy Camille has a feminine name and a gentle temperament, and is out of place in the training camp. All the boys except him had passed stress training - to be able to respond hard to the negative and malicious stares from other people in the opposite direction. The boys disdained his company and even attacked him in groups. Finally, Camille cried angrily and said that she just didn&#39;t want a war. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Actress Lucid Grunstein, who plays Camille in the play, told Southern Weekend reporters, &quot;A group of people exclude one person, which makes me feel uneasy.&quot; To her For me, this scene is very important. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;Stage Creation&quot; and &quot;Dark Theater&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The group drama of the masculinity training camp was the most enjoyable for the actresses who played the boys. A play. Abuse, yelling, crowding, and pushing, even in a period of darkness where the actors could not be seen, the stage was still as noisy as a pot. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;They released all their observations and imaginations about adolescent boys. Without the constraints of their own gender, they felt that they had a particularly large degree of freedom. During rehearsals, their performance even went so far that Pomera had to pull them back some. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Louis Mist Theater Company&#39;s collective creative approach gives the actors great creative freedom. After completing a large amount of data collection, Pomera took these basic materials and improvised with the team. There is no script written in advance, he will only give a situation, such as a boy trying to sell his robot. The actors&#39; improvisational performances are like flowers blooming from a blank slate, and the direction and plot of the story gradually develop, as well as details such as lines and actions. Pomera will let the actors swap roles, such as the actor playing the robot, to play the boy selling the robot, so as to inspire the actors to fully understand what is behind each role and look for more possibilities. The actors are very deeply involved in creation, &quot;Every character we play has our own shadow, and at the same time, this character also has the imprint of this character on us.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The process of story text generation is intertwined with stage design such as scenery, lighting, and sound. This &quot;stage creation&quot; is Pomera&#39;s unique way of working. He likes to call himself &quot;drama creator&quot; rather than &quot;director&quot; or &quot;screenwriter&quot;, and doesn&#39;t want people to think that screenwriters and directors are two different divisions of labor. In his creation, the stage and text are produced simultaneously and adjusted according to the actors&#39; rehearsals. This is very different from traditional drama creation where the script and director&#39;s intention are first prepared and then rehearsed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Dark Theater&quot; is another originality of Pomera and the troupe. They make good use of the visual and psychological resonance of darkness to make the power of narrative more condensed and full. Together with the &quot;less is more&quot; stage style and subtle and precise use of lighting, they constitute the unique temperament of their theater. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“A scene suddenly lights up in front of you. Then the light used in it is relatively dark, unlike sometimes when we see various lights on in performances to stimulate your senses. . It may be at a relatively subtle level, detailed and precise, but at the same time it is very strong and intense.&quot; Wang Jing said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Pomera placed his own expectations in the troupe&#39;s name. Louis comes from his father’s name and also means light, while the mist symbolizes his exploration of the unknown world and also represents his pursuit of dramatic aesthetics. His works emphasize that the world is not black and white, and human nature is not divided into good and evil. In complex and diverse situations, the audience only feels and experiences different ways of existence and the ambiguity of truth. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the 33 years since its establishment, the Louis Mist Theater Company has created and toured 34 plays and performed more than 4,000 performances. In 2019, Louis Mist Theater Company&#39;s &quot;Little Red Riding Hood&quot; was performed at the Tianqiao Art Center in Beijing. It was the first time that Pomera&#39;s work was performed in mainland China. After four years, &quot;Legend of Fairy Tales&quot; came to the Wuzhen Theater Festival as the closing drama. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the performance, some Chinese audiences asked whether they would tour domestically in the future. Wang Jing said that this possibility is slim. The first is due to schedule reasons. The troupe tours hundreds of shows in various countries every year and needs to make reservations at least two years in advance. Secondly, the work requires high stage technology, which is difficult for ordinary theaters to achieve. Thirdly, Pomera has extremely high requirements for stage presentation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Jing recalled: &quot;We had a meeting with the technical team in advance as to whether this play could come to Wuzhen at the beginning. The French technical director was very clear that if we couldn&#39;t guarantee that they would have no way to come, because they I don’t want the performance to be cut down.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The theater cannot hold more than 450 people. Pomera refused to perform in a large theater with thousands of people. “The director is particularly concerned about the audience and needs the audience in the first row and the last row to be You can see clearly.&quot; Wang Jing explained to Southern Weekend reporters, &quot;Many of our theaters in China are still based on profitability. If there are less than 1,000 or 2,000 people, they cannot make back their money.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt; /p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https:// feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 15 Nov 2023 21:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[醉驾女子反诬交警“猥亵”：如此虚假指控，“灵感”从何而来？丨快评]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260647]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-15 20:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Recently, in Huangshi, Hubei, a drunk woman rear-ended the car in front of the traffic police, and the police prepared to drink her. During the test, the woman actually said she wanted to report it to the traffic police for &quot;obscenity.&quot; Finally, the police forcefully took the woman to the hospital to collect a blood sample. The test results showed that the alcohol content in her blood was 207.75mg/100ml, which met the standard for drunk driving. The case is currently under further processing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From the video of the scene, the woman involved rear-ended her car. The traffic police on duty saw that the woman&#39;s face was &quot;red&quot; and asked her to get out of the car and take an alcohol test. The woman involved responded, &quot;I don&#39;t blush when I drink.&quot; The traffic police required the woman to take a breath test as part of their normal law enforcement, but the response she received was &quot;I&#39;m going to sue you for obscenity.&quot; When the traffic police said, &quot;As a citizen (you need to cooperate with law enforcement),&quot; the woman involved simply said, &quot;I&#39;m not a citizen, so I won&#39;t brag.&quot; Then she had to rely on enforcement to complete the blood sample test. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The facts of this case are not complicated, and the basic facts are as clear as water. But there are still many points worthy of in-depth discussion. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First, judging from the facts of this case, in addition to being suspected of dangerous driving, the woman involved is also suspected of other illegal and criminal acts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The alcohol content in the blood of the woman involved has exceeded the standard of 80mg/100ml, which is considered drunk driving. Her behavior violated both the &quot;Road Traffic Safety Law of the People&#39;s Republic of China&quot; and the &quot;Criminal Law of the People&#39;s Republic of China&quot;. According to Article 91 of the Road Traffic Safety Law, anyone who drives a motor vehicle drunk will be restrained by the traffic management department of the public security organ until he sobers up, his motor vehicle driving license will be revoked, and he will be investigated for criminal responsibility in accordance with the law; he will not be able to obtain a new motor vehicle driving license within five years; and according to the Criminal Law Article 133: Anyone who drives a motor vehicle drunk on the road shall be sentenced to criminal detention and shall also be fined. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If the woman involved was only driving drunk and rear-ended the car, her punishment may be limited to the revocation of her driver&#39;s license, detention and fines, and she would also be compensated for the loss of the owner of the car in front of her. The problem is that other behaviors of the woman involved at the scene are also suspected of illegal crimes. Her sentence &quot;I will sue you for obscenity&quot; is a public accusation against an individual in a public place, so she must be held accountable for the truth of the accusation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The video clearly shows that the traffic police on duty were enforcing the law normally. They reasonably suspected that the owner of the rear-ended car was suspected of drunk driving and required him to undergo an alcohol test. They were completely performing their official duties. According to the &quot;Operational Procedures for Investigating and Dealing with Drunk Driving&quot; attached to the &quot;Traffic Police Road Duty Law Enforcement Work Standards&quot;, the traffic police on duty have the right to &quot;require motor vehicle drivers suspected of drunk driving to get out of the vehicle and undergo an alcohol test.&quot; Therefore, the public accusations made by the woman involved are outright false accusations, and she should bear corresponding legal responsibility. At a small scale, this is slander and slander, at a larger scale, it is even false accusation and frame-up, because the woman involved also said, &quot;I want to sue you.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Article 42 of the &quot;Public Security Administration Punishment Law of the People&#39;s Republic of China&quot; stipulates that &quot;those who openly insult others or fabricate facts to slander others&quot; &quot;fabricate facts and frame others in an attempt to subject others to criminal prosecution or public security &quot;Management of punishment&quot; is an illegal act and shall be punished with detention and a fine. Article 243 of the Criminal Law also stipulates that fabricating facts to frame others with the intention of subjecting others to criminal prosecution constitutes the crime of false accusation and frame-up. If the circumstances are serious, the offender shall be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of not more than three years, criminal detention or surveillance; if serious consequences are caused, the offender shall be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of not less than three years and not more than ten years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Secondly, the social phenomenon behind this case is even more worrying, that is, some people use their specific identities and speech skills to bypass clear rules and seek privileges for themselves. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The woman in question reflexively &quot;sue you for obscenity&quot;, which shows that similar thinking has been deeply rooted in her bones, that is, she uses false accusations to carry out threats and circumvents clear rules to seek the privilege of impunity for herself. The &quot;inspiration&quot; brought by &quot;false accusations of sexual assault&quot;, &quot;false accusations of rape&quot; and &quot;Internet essays&quot; in reality may have long been internalized into the thinking of the parties concerned. The stereotype behind this kind of thinking is enough to make people feel chilling: as long as the matter is settled first If you &quot;make a big fuss&quot; and accuse the other party, you can extort money if you go forward, and you can get away with it if you back off. And even if the words fail, there will be no punishment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What is even more worrying is that if there is no video evidence in this case, can the woman involved insist that the traffic police molested her and then counter-sue the traffic police on duty? Can the woman in question use this to blackmail the traffic police on duty and gain the advantage of getting out of jail for herself? It seems that as long as I make such a fuss, others and even public power will &quot;give way to me&quot;. This is a trample on justice. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Thirdly, what is even more serious is that the woman involved made false accusations against state public officials, which is a blatant challenge to the law enforcement authority of the police. According to Article 8 of the &quot;Regulations on Safeguarding the Authority of Civil Police Law Enforcement by Public Security Organs&quot;, in the process of performing their duties and exercising their powers in accordance with the law, or because of the performance of their duties and powers in accordance with the law, police officers encounter &quot;threats, intimidation, insults, slander, or threats to themselves and their close relatives, In cases of &quot;harassment&quot;, the public security organs should actively safeguard the law enforcement authority of the police. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Therefore, if the woman involved is not dealt with seriously and her other illegal and criminal acts other than dangerous driving are investigated, it will inevitably bring negative incentives to similar behaviors and stimulate more lawless people to follow the same pattern, and even Continuing to carry out false accusations and creating obstacles for the normal law enforcement of the police is definitely not a blessing to the public interest. This case is still under investigation and the police on duty should be treated fairly to deter those who try to follow suit. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 15 Nov 2023 20:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[浙江慈溪首富惹麻烦：原高管未能兑现股权激励，举报上市公司危废风险]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260676]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-15 19:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;August 30, 2023, Shanghai International Power Components and Renewable Energy Management Exhibition Held at the New International Exhibition Center in Pudong, Hesheng Silicon has a booth.

He resigned in December 2018. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;His wife said that after Fang Hongcheng&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;resigned&lt;/span>;, Luo Liguo refused to fulfill the equity agreement &lt;span>; between the two parties and put pressure on the Jiaxing municipal government, which led to Fang Hongcheng&#39;s resignation. He and his brother Fang Hongxing were arrested and detained for 17 months. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Early the next morning, Hoshine Silicon issued a clarification announcement, disclosing that Fang Hongcheng’s case of bribery and job embezzlement by non-state staff would be heard at the Pinghu People’s Court on the same day. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The company’s official website shows that Hesheng Silicon Industry was invested and established by Ningbo Hesheng Group in 2005 and listed on the main board of the Shanghai Stock Exchange in 2017. It is the most complete silicon-based full industry chain company in the world and the only one in the industry that also has industrial silicon. It is a high-tech enterprise with production capacity of , organic silicon, polycrystalline silicon, photovoltaic modules, etc. It has production bases in Zhejiang, Xinjiang, Yunnan, Sichuan, Heilongjiang and other places. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hopson Silicon Industry’s third quarter report for 2023 shows that the Luo Liguo family is the actual controller of Hopeson Silicon Industry. Luo Liguo and his children collectively hold approximately 78.59% of the equity of the listed company. According to the 2023 Hurun Rich List, the Luo Liguo family ranks 66th with a wealth of 60 billion yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The person who spoke out on behalf of Fang Hongcheng was his cousin Tong Jianpeng. He told Southern Weekend reporters that Fang Hongcheng’s case did not open as scheduled on November 13, but instead held a full-day pre-trial conference. November 14 is still a pre-trial conference, and the court date is still uncertain. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the morning of November 14th and 15th, Fang Hongcheng’s family filed applications for off-site jurisdiction with the Jiaxing Intermediate People’s Court and the Zhejiang Provincial Higher People’s Court respectively, hoping to transfer the case to a people’s court outside Jiaxing for trial. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What happened behind this real-name reporting controversy? &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The equity lawsuit interrupted by the criminal case&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;The conflict between Fang Hongcheng and Luo Liguo stems from two equity disputes in recent years. Fang Hongcheng received partial support in the first instance of the case. Southern Weekend reporters obtained relevant referee documents. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In September 2015, Fang Hongcheng signed an &quot;Equity Incentive Agreement&quot; with Hesheng Silicon and its employee stockholding platform Ningbo Yingrong Enterprise Management Consulting Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as Ningbo Yingrong), stipulating that Fang Hongcheng It acquired 5% of Ningbo Yingrong&#39;s equity at a price of 2.786 million yuan, thus indirectly holding 300,000 shares of Hesheng Silicon Industry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;At the same time, the &quot;Equity Incentive Agreement&quot; also stipulates that Fang Hongcheng needs to continue to serve Hesheng Silicon Industry for 5 years after receiving the equity incentive, and not engage in horizontal competition during this period&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;, &lt;/span>;Do not damage the interests of the company, otherwise you will be held responsible for relevant legal liabilities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 30, 2017, after the company was listed at an issue price of 19.52 yuan/share, it rose all the way to 252.79 yuan/share, and the company’s market value exceeded 260 billion yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2018, Hoshine Silicon Industry’s annual equity distribution decision was to convert 0.4 shares into shares per share. Fang Hongcheng’s shareholding in Hoshine Silicone Industry therefore increased to 420,000 shares. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In December of that year, Fang Hongcheng resigned from Hesheng Silicon Industry. Fang Hongcheng said in a self-report that he started his own business after leaving his job. In 2019, he established Zhejiang Xianglin New Materials Co., Ltd. and Zhejiang Yingke New Materials Co., Ltd., which are controlled by him and have no competitive relationship with Hesheng Silicon Industry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On April 30, 2021, Fang Hongcheng sued Ningbo Yingrong, with Hesheng Silicon as the third party. Fang said that the lock-up period for its shareholding has expired, and requested that the proceeds from the realization of incentive equity be paid in accordance with the agreement, and the unpaid annual dividends from 2018 to 2020 should be made up. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The People&#39;s Court of Pinghu City, Zhejiang Province found in the first instance that the above-mentioned three parties also signed a &quot;Supplementary Agreement&quot; in 2018, clarifying that Fang Hongcheng agreed to reduce its shareholding by 25% to pay taxes and other fees. . Including the dividend shares distributed in 2018, Fang Hongcheng holds a total of 315,000 shares of Halcyon Silicon. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, the Pinghu Court held that the non-competition clause was not a condition for obtaining incentive equity, but an obligation after obtaining the equity. The plaintiff Fang Hongcheng should bear legal liability for failing to fulfill the corresponding obligations, rather than losing the incentive equity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;On March 28, 2022&lt;/span>;, the Pinghu Court supported part of Fang Hongcheng’s petition in the first instance and ruled that Ningbo Yingrong had sold the 315,000 Hesheng Silicon A shares it held. After deducting transaction costs, it was returned to Fang Hongcheng, and the latter was paid stock dividends of 147,600 yuan. Ningbo Yingrong subsequently appealed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, during the second instance of the Jiaxing Intermediate People’s Court, Fang Hongcheng was subject to criminal compulsory measures on suspicion of official embezzlement. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Jiaxing Intermediate People’s Court believes that Fang Hongcheng’s prosecution should be dismissed and the relevant materials should be transferred to the public security organs. If the public security organs determine that the case is indeed a civil dispute after review, Fang Hongcheng can assert separate rights. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On November 29, 2022, the Jiaxing Intermediate People’s Court ruled to revoke the first-instance judgment of the Pinghu Court and reject Fang Hongcheng’s prosecution. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Illegal agency holding&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Another equity dispute occurred directly between Fang Hongcheng and Luo Liguo. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On January 1, 2017, Fang Hongcheng and Luo Liguo signed an &quot;Equity Transfer Agreement&quot;, agreeing to transfer the 1.2611 million shares of Hesheng Silicon held indirectly by the latter (accounting for 0.21% of the total pre-listing share capital). Transferred to Fang Hongcheng at a price of 3.17 yuan/share. Moreover, Fang Hongcheng voluntarily promised to serve Luo Liguo&#39;s actual control company for at least 5 years after signing the agreement, and not to engage in horizontal competition during this period. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the same day, the two also signed the &quot;Equity Holding Agreement&quot;, with Luo Liguo holding the above shares on behalf of Fang Hong. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to materials provided by Fang Hongcheng’s family to Southern Weekend reporters, Hoshine Silicon began listing work in 2011, with Fang Hongcheng serving as the leader of the listing working group. After the Spring Festival of 2017, &lt;span>;either because of Fang Hongcheng’s recognition of his work&lt;/span>; or because he was worried about his job-hopping, Luo Liguo proposed that Fang Hong accept his year-end bonus and transfer a small amount of money in Luo’s name at the price of the company’s net assets. The equity is held by Luo on behalf of the company. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the judgment document, on December 14, 2017, Fang Hongcheng and Luo Liguo signed a new &quot;&lt;span>;Equity Transfer and Agency Holding Agreement&lt;/span>;&quot;, which agreed that Fang Hongcheng would pay 50 yuan per share. The total price of the 261,100 shares transferred before the transfer was 13.055 million yuan. After this transfer, Fang Hongcheng still indirectly holds 1 million shares of Hesheng Silicon Industry, which is held by Luo Liguo on behalf of him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fang Hong admitted that she indirectly held a total of 1.4 million shares of Hesheng Silicon. Because on the basis of the above-mentioned 1 million shares, it also holds 0.4 shares for each converted share distributed by Hesheng Silicon Industry in 2018. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;On April 25, 2021&lt;/span>;, Fang Hongcheng applied to the Hangzhou Arbitration Commission for arbitration over this equity transfer dispute, requiring Luo Liguo to sell 1.4 million shares, &lt;span>; and transfer the proceeds and related shares &lt;/span>;The dividends for 2018 and 2019 will be paid to myself. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Supervision has always been strict on the issue of equity holdings of listed companies&lt;/span>;. The Hangzhou Arbitration Commission cited the Securities Law and the &quot;Administrative Measures for Information Disclosure of Listed Companies&quot; and determined that the agreement between Fang Hongcheng and Luo Liguo on holding shares on behalf of others was invalid, but other clauses were still valid. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Hangzhou Arbitration Commission believed that the two parties agreed that Fang Hongcheng would serve Luo Liguo Real Control Company full-time and diligently for at least 5 years starting from January 1, 2017. However, Fang Hongcheng resigned on December 7, 2018 and only performed 40 % of the service period commitment, so you can receive 340,676 shares of Halcyon Silicon and part of the dividends from 2018 to 2020. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On February 23, 2022, the Hangzhou Arbitration Commission ruled that Luo Liguo reduced and liquidated 340,676 shares of Hesheng Silicon Industry, deducting transaction costs, and paid it to Fang Hongcheng together with a dividend of 376,700 yuan. Luo Liguo also appealed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Luo Liguo claimed in the appeal that Fang Hongcheng violated the non-competition agreement by joining Xinyaqiang (603155.SH), a company in the same industry, as deputy general manager and holding 2.81 million shares the same month he resigned from Halcyon Silicon. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fang Hongcheng did try to do this. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xin Yaqiang’s prospectus shows that the company signed a labor contract with Fang Hongcheng on December 20, 2018, agreeing to appoint Fang Hongcheng as the company’s deputy general manager if the conditions for employment are met. This agreement was reviewed and approved at the shareholders&#39; meeting 6 days later. Fang Hongcheng was granted 2.81 million incentive shares and invested with his own funds. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, because Fang Hongcheng failed to provide relevant documents that met the conditions for the appointment of deputy general manager, he voluntarily applied and with the consent of Xinyaqiang, the labor contract between the two parties was terminated on December 30, 2018. Fang Hongcheng voluntarily transferred out of its shares in Xinyaqiang. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On May 23, 2022, the Hangzhou Intermediate People’s Court rejected Luo Liguo’s application to revoke the arbitration award. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hopson Silicon stated in the clarification announcement that the award is currently in the implementation stage. Luo Liguo has filed an application with the court not to enforce the arbitration award, which is still pending in the court. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fang Hongcheng received partial support in the above two disputes. Based on Hesheng Silicon’s stock price at the time, Fang Hongcheng could make a maximum profit of more than 81 million yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Bringing out hidden dangers in hazardous waste treatment&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;On November 22, 2022, Hesheng Silicon Industry announced that the company’s former director and general manager Fang Hongcheng had been investigated and terminated by the public security agency for suspected job embezzlement. Transferred to the procuratorate for review and prosecution, the criminal conduct involved occurred during his tenure at the company. The case was discovered by the company&#39;s internal self-examination and reported to the public security organs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This incident brings out the hidden dangers of hazardous waste disposal in Hesheng Silicon Industry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to relevant research papers, in the production of silicone, a mixture of by-products with a boiling point lower than 40°C is called low boilers, most of which are tetramethylsilane and dimethylsilane. Chlorosilane, trichlorosilane, methyl chloride, etc. The boiling points of low-boiling components are very close, so it is difficult to separate and utilize them. These compounds are flammable and explosive. Among them, tetramethylsilane is included in the national &quot;List of Hazardous Chemicals&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hopson Silicon Industry’s prospectus and 2023 semi-annual report both disclosed that low-boiling by-products are the company’s main solid waste and are strictly implemented for external sale. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to Fang Hongcheng’s self-report and the materials provided by his family members, in 2011, Hesheng Silicon was in trouble both internally and externally, and was in urgent need of technological transformation and cost reduction. Since the technical transformation of hazardous chemicals production involves government approval, Luo Liguo decided to proceed quickly with all new construction and reconstruction projects, competing with policies to race against time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fang Hongcheng listed 8 illegal new construction and reconstruction projects at that time, all of which failed to go through relevant approval procedures such as safety assessment and environmental assessment as required. The direct economic benefits of most projects were 10 million yuan/year. above. One of the projects is to relatively safely dispose of low-boiling substances classified as hazardous waste in a closed system and turn them into relatively stable &quot;hydrolysis oil&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The above materials stated that &quot;hydrolysis oil&quot; is the name of Hesheng Silicon Industry. It is a less corrosive, complex, flammable and explosive oily dangerous chemical converted into a low-boiling substance and water through the reaction. Taste. Hesheng Silicon still needs to dispose of the &quot;hydrolysis oil&quot; in a timely manner, otherwise it will cause the company to stop production. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This job fell to Fang Hongcheng&#39;s younger brother Fang Hongxing. &quot;Fang Hongxing risked violations of laws and regulations, safety and environmental risks, and cooperated with others to dispose and utilize &#39;hydrolysis oil&#39; and obtain profits.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p >;In April 2019, Fang Hongcheng established Zhejiang Xianglin New Materials Co., Ltd., an asset-light company that produces special silicone coatings. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The above materials show that the following month, Hesheng Silicon accused Fang Hongcheng of &quot;breach of trust and damage&quot; on the grounds that Luo Liguo was unaware of the matter and Fang Hongcheng built it without authorization. &quot;interests of listed companies&quot; and reported the case to the Jiaxing Port District Public Security Bureau. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After Fang Hongcheng filed lawsuits and arbitrations regarding two equity disputes, in August 2021, Hesheng Silicon reported the case to the Hong Kong Public Security Bureau for the second time on suspicion of Fang Hongcheng being a non-state employee taking bribes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The report letter from Fang Hongcheng’s family attached a decision to cancel the case made by the Hong Kong Public Security Bureau on December 31, 2021, stating that there were no criminal facts in Fang Hongcheng’s suspected bribery case by non-state staff and the case was cancelled. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, Fang Hongcheng and Luo Liguo have argued several times over the disposal of &quot;hydrolysis oil&quot; in the equity dispute litigation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Luo Liguo used a set of sales contracts and evaluation reports as evidence, accusing Fang Hongcheng of &quot;selling cheaply&quot; &quot;hydrolysis oil&quot; with an estimated price of more than 10,000 yuan per ton during his tenure, at a price of less than 2,000 yuan/ton. Seeking huge benefits for its affiliated companies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Fang Hongcheng used email exchanges and statements as evidence that his production and sales of &quot;hydrolysis oil&quot; were only in compliance with the decisions of Luo Liguo and other company executives, and were not an act of personal gain. Moreover, the production and sales activities of &quot;hydrolysis oil&quot; are illegal and non-compliant, and will not bring any legitimate benefits to Hesheng Silicon Industry. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the court focused on the equity dispute between the two and did not make a ruling on the &quot;hydrolysis oil&quot; issue. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The company will no longer relocate&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In June 2022, Fang Hongcheng was placed on file by the Hong Kong Public Security Bureau. In his self-report, he stated that the Fang Hongcheng brothers were summoned on June 13 and placed under &quot;residential surveillance&quot; in a designated residence the next day. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Fang Hongcheng and his family believe that the change of events was due to Luo Liguo blackmailing the Jiaxing Municipal Government on the pretext of moving the listed company from Jiaxing City to Cixi, a county-level city under the jurisdiction of Ningbo City. To. According to relevant articles from relevant departments of the Jiaxing Municipal Party Committee in 2018, Hesheng Silicon Industry is the first listed company cultivated by Jiaxing Port Zone. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hopson Silicon stated in the clarification announcement that the company’s registered address is in Jiaxing, but the Jiaxing production base is mainly chemical production facilities and the office conditions are limited, so it will announce the office address in January 2022 Changed to Cixi, Ningbo. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to &quot;Ningbo Evening News&quot;, Luo Liguo was born in Changhe Town, Cixi, the &quot;hometown of straw hats&quot;. He started his business by opening a straw hat factory and is known as the richest man in Cixi. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the clarification announcement, in order to unify the office address and registered address, the company held the 12th meeting of the third board of directors and planned to change the company&#39;s address to Cixi. Later, in order to maintain relevant qualification registration, the company terminated the change of company address and canceled the shareholders&#39; meeting to review the matter. These two events were announced on May 28 and June 8, 2022 respectively. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In May 2023&lt;/span>;, Fang Hongcheng’s family reported to Jiaxing Port Area Emergency Management Bureau, Jiaxing Municipal Emergency Management Bureau and Sichuan Provincial Emergency Management Department that Hesheng Silicon Industry illegally constructed a low-boiling hydrolysis device , issues surrounding the illegal sale of hazardous chemicals, received mixed responses&lt;span>;. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the complaint letter, the Jiaxing Port Area Emergency Management Bureau responded three times stating that no hydrolysis device was found on site, that low-boiling substances could be sold as by-products, and that &quot;hydrolysis oil&quot; was not hazardous. Product Catalog. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The Sichuan Provincial Department of Emergency Management stated that &quot;hydrolysis oil&quot; is a hazardous chemical and is not within the scope of the safety production license of Hesheng Silicon Industry (Luzhou) Co., Ltd., and has ordered the company to suspend the use of &quot;hydrolysis oil&quot; &quot;Hydrolysis oil&quot; production equipment, and investigate the company&#39;s suspected production safety violations. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hopson Silicone clarified the situation of &quot;hydrolysis oil&quot; and stated that the &quot;Hazardous Chemicals Registration Varieties&quot; handled by its Jiaxing subsidiary Hoshine Silicone (Jiaxing) Co., Ltd. includes low-boiling oil (i.e. &quot; hydrolyzed oil&quot;). The &quot;Hazardous Chemicals Registration Varieties&quot; that its Luzhou subsidiary Hesheng Silicon Industry (Luzhou) Co., Ltd. has handled also includes hydrogenated silicone oil S. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to Qichacha, Hesheng Silicon Industry (Jiaxing) Co., Ltd. was established on June 29, 2020. This means that Halcyon Silicon did not respond to how Fang Hongcheng handled low-boiling materials during his tenure. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 15 Nov 2023 19:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[文物保护的困境与探索]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260664]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-15 18:30:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;Recently, a thousand-year-old cliff statue monument located in Nanjiang County, Sichuan Province was found to be painted with &quot;makeup&quot;, and netizens called it &quot;disfigured&quot; &quot;.

Most of these traumas come from family of origin and close relationships. Sometimes everyone forgets that Xiang Biao exists. During a party, he quietly got up to wash the dishes, and almost no one noticed him. These young people are participants in the &quot;Seeing the First 500 Meters&quot; social art workshop launched by artists He Zhisen and Xiang Biao, as well as Duan Zhipeng, a doctoral student at the Oslo School of Architecture and Design. The works of the workshop have participated in the 9th Shenzhen-Hong Kong Urban/Architecture Biennale. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The last time Xiang Biao returned to China was in 2019 before the epidemic. Xiang Biao is the director of the Max Planck Institute for Social Anthropology in Germany and a professor of social anthropology at the University of Oxford in the UK. He became famous for his research on Zhejiang Village in Beijing. After many years abroad, he has become active in the Chinese-speaking world again in recent years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When Xiang Biao returned to China this time, he frequently chatted with various people. For example, every time he took a taxi, he didn’t want to miss the opportunity to talk to the driver. In his hometown of Wenzhou, he found that most taxi drivers were over 45 years old and usually had another job. A driver told Xiang Biao that he helped people open credit cards. Xiang Biao was curious about who else was using credit cards now that mobile payment is so convenient. The driver said that some people need small loans for short-term turnover. And looking for customers to open a card involves the gray chain of data buying and selling. In an online car-hailing car in Guangzhou, when the conversation came up about the career of the driver&#39;s son, he pointed to the platform recording equipment in the car and made a shushing gesture, and the conversation stopped. &quot;These are all new points for me. I don&#39;t know if they are useful, but they can help me discover the richness of society.&quot; Xiang Biao told Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xiang Biao said that he is a person who is far away from art. He almost never watches movies and rarely goes to art galleries and exhibition halls. There was only one exception when he served as a judge for a German artist’s application project. . &quot;This is a German habit, to find people with different subject backgrounds to participate in the review.&quot; He said. The &quot;Seeing the First 500 Meters&quot; workshop is his most in-depth participation in a public art and social art activity. His original idea was to encourage everyone to go to the community and meet strangers, but on the one hand, due to the uncertainty caused by the epidemic in 2022; on the other hand, many people found that if the radius of 500 meters continued to be reduced, the things they were most concerned about would be , is family and companionship. As a result, many of the workshop&#39;s works were skewed. Everyone&#39;s anxiety is superimposed on social and personal life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He Zhisen once held an exhibition in a vegetable market in Guangzhou. On the podium of South China University of Technology, he said that he had held more than 100 workshops, and most of them dispersed after seeing the first 500 people. m” members are the most closely connected. I heard that Xiang Biao made a special trip to Guangzhou to chat with everyone. Some of the participants in the workshop came from Nanjing and some from abroad. On this day, Xiang Biao sat quietly in the back row of the lecture hall, like an older student. He followed workshop member Manman through the noisy lanes and handshake buildings of Shipai Village to the art space in the urban village. This space, known as the &quot;mobile club&quot;, was originally a garbage recycling station. Xiang Biao talked with everyone about Wenzhou, the south, and the differences between the north and the south of China. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/15/pV6FUnCDyc5oDAwewe9FJCGkWMNjCZKxZczL7bL2.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/15/pV6FUnCDyc5oDAwewe9FJCGkWMNjCZKxZczL7bL2.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;258366&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In October 2023, Xiang Biao (first from left in the back row) communicated with young people at the &quot;Mobile Club&quot;, an art space in Guangzhou. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xiang Biao found that he was more popular among young people in China than he imagined, but he did not feel that he was a young person not as a mentor but as an interlocutor. Dialogue research is also his working method in facing the research direction of &quot;common anxiety&quot;. In October 2023, Southern Weekend reporters conducted an exclusive interview with Xiang Biao in Guangzhou. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Understanding art through anthropology, &quot;recognition&quot; is different from &quot;understanding&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Why has the contemporary art world paid more and more attention to anthropology in recent years? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xiang Biao: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;The so-called elite art collected in galleries and museums can do a lot in terms of methods, techniques and forms of expression. But if it is public art, if you only make breakthroughs in form and method, it will be meaningless to the common people. Others will not know what your breakthrough is, and it cannot evoke that kind of resonance. The common people will not understand what you are doing. If there is no connection with his life, then he cannot participate or be further stimulated. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At this time, public art needs to be ideological, to find a problem, and then this problem can be expressed in a very condensed artistic way, whether it is a drama, an installation, or a painting. Well, once you express it, everyone can recognize it, and at the same time, the way you express it makes everyone see that this is a door, and they can&#39;t help but open it. There is a space behind the door. This way everyone can participate. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Such an artistic work must have a certain degree of thought, a large amount of observation of experience, a very detailed and sincere appreciation, and then sublimate an image, a motif, and a core symbol. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Then why is anthropology, rather than general social sciences or psychology, communicating with art? Because anthropology is to see some problems and truths from very specific experiences. It is not like philosophy, which starts from an existing problem, such as &quot;What is a good person?&quot;; it is also not like sociology, Think about it from a macro social phenomenon. Anthropology uses daily behavior to see some of the problems behind it, so anthropology has a strong sense of recognition. People can tell at a glance that this is related to them. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;How do you understand &quot;sense of recognition&quot;? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xiang Biao: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Recognition means that when you see something, it evokes your understanding of your own life experience, and it will produce a mutual projection. So recognition is very important. Our understanding of the world must be based on our own life experience. You mobilize your memory and then make a new interpretation of this thing. This is called recognition. If you don’t understand, you just don’t recognize it. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, whether it is Kafka or Benjamin, if we do not have a good understanding of European culture, we cannot recognize them. In fact, what he said is very direct in his context, and it is easy for people with similar life experiences to recognize it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Just like when we look at Lu Xun, it is difficult for young people today to understand Lu Xun, also because they do not recognize it. This does not mean that you can solve it through knowledge and logic. Of course, it does not rule out that there is a purely literal and logical way. You think you understand it, but you are completely unable to mobilize your own experience. (This situation) actually happens a lot. We all feel this way when we read some documents. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are many people who engage in academic research and art. In fact, their understanding is not based on their own life experience, but on establishing relationships between texts, which can also form an understanding. Or logical interpretation, it feels like you understand it, but the effect of this understanding is very different from what we call &quot;recognition&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;The participants of the workshop you met in Guangzhou this time, Most of them are very young. Did you encounter any new excitement while communicating with everyone? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xiang Biao: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Of course there is a lot of excitement. They are not willing to adopt the mainstream meritocracy (to live), and may not necessarily be successful in a secular sense. Some people have just resigned. Their backgrounds are quite diverse, including carpenters, civil servants, video makers, and marketers. There are also people who study art, not particularly many, but these people all have a certain sense of art. Artistic sense means that they are more sensitive to their own perceptions. They may not necessarily think about these sensitivities, but the &quot;sensitivity&quot; will stay on him or her, and it is a bit sticky and will not be easily brushed off. Artistic people are sensitive and adhesive people. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The workshop was a great education for me. It made me softer and paid more attention to people&#39;s subjective emotions. As I just said, these young people are not very mainstream. Many of them are weak and not very confident. There were several people who could barely speak at the beginning of last year, couldn&#39;t sleep the day before the meeting, and were so nervous. Many young people I have interacted with before, such as students at Oxford, are very talkative. Oxford is a famous place for cultivating politicians. But many of the expressions of the young people in this workshop were inconsistent. This kind of difficult expression sometimes turns into awkward silence, but once he or she speaks, you can feel that there are very rich feelings behind it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to my previous habits, the efficiency of this kind of communication is very low. I am a relatively rational person and have been pursuing clarity. I now realize that I was actually very closed-minded and had a very single perception of the world. I need more patience, this is an education for me. I think that to promote many things here, we cannot all do them in a rational way. Art is a good tool. I listen more. Before, I didn’t pay enough attention to the richness and sensitivity of emotions, and the many mixed and unclear things, but now I pay more attention to them. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“I am not a mentor, but an interlocutor”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312 , STKaiti;&quot;>;How do you interact with the audience during lectures or online live broadcasts? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xiang Biao: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;After the speech, the questions asked by the public fell into two categories. The first type is to ask questions based on the concepts I proposed. To be honest, this kind of question is not particularly meaningful. In the end, it turned into me having to define and explain the concepts. What is really impactful are the second type of questions, which are very specific questions based on life experience. It&#39;s a difficult question to answer, but it gives me some punch. For example, some parents will ask me, saying that involution is not good. My child&#39;s grades are getting worse and worse. Should I send him to tutoring? No matter how I answer, this parent will most likely send their children to make up classes. Then my answer may be, how you define make-up lessons when you interact with your children is very critical. I can feel the parent&#39;s anxiety and entanglement. I can&#39;t change the objective environment, but the more useful and appropriate answer to him is how to define, state, and treat this matter. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We may need to distinguish between thinking and thoughts. Thinking is inferential and requires rigorous logic; thinking is divergent and multi-dimensional. This kind of dialogue allowed me to change from one-dimensional thinking to richer and more sensitive thinking. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;What are the differences between the academic workshops you participated in? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xiang Biao: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;That kind of workshop requires using very clear words to express, theoretically and conceptually speaking about life, and it takes a lot of time. Generally no more than three days. This &quot;Seeing the First 500 Meters&quot; is completely different. It is open, does not have a fixed theme, and is against conceptualization. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Many young people like to communicate with you, and they are very Trust you. Do you consider yourself a mentor to young people? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xiang Biao: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I was quite surprised when I returned to China this time. I found that I am more popular than I thought. How eager young people are. Beyond my imagination. But I don’t feel like a mentor to young people. I hate the role of mentor. When I was a young man, I didn’t pay much attention to life mentors, so I won’t become the character I hate. I am a conversationalist. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I think the most important thing is not that I tell you what you should do, but that I inspire you to think more. I will raise some questions, highlight some paradoxes, do some analysis, make you think, and let us find that the original thinking may be a bit simple. This is my job. Even if I have some so-called advice, it&#39;s about how to think, not about what to do morally and behaviorally. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;But it is true that when many young people ask you questions, they will ask about Regarding issues such as anxiety and involution, there is a feeling of expecting you to be a life mentor. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xiang Biao: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I don’t think so. They would also ask each other these questions at friends&#39; gatherings. They would say that the involution has become like this, what should I do? These questions are not only asked among friends and relatives, but also asked by oneself at night when I can&#39;t sleep. I think maybe that question occupied his mind and it would come out naturally, so he would ask that question to everyone. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What’s interesting is how I answer such a question. He knew I wouldn&#39;t give him an answer, couldn&#39;t show him a path. Most people don&#39;t think so. What he actually asked was how to face a problem that is known to have no solution. So I put myself in his situation, understand his situation, and respond with sincerity, which may be more effective. This is completely a friendship-like communication, not a mentor-mentee relationship. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;The book &quot;Use Yourself as a Method&quot; is a best-seller, maybe That’s why young people are inspired by you. As an anthropologist, why have you been more willing to give interviews or appear in mass media in recent years? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xiang Biao: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;In the 19th and 20th centuries, when social science first emerged, the world was very different from today. The difference between scholars and non-scholars at that time Very big at the time. For example, a European scholar needs to learn ancient Greek, Latin, and various philosophies. Chinese scholars like Liang Qichao and Yan Fu first introduced social sciences, and most of the people are illiterate. But in the 21st century, our youth’s level of education, their ability to think and master knowledge, and their information are no different from those of scholars. And we often think that the experts are among the people. Some of the things on site B are actually more interesting than those written by scholars in many academies. This means that academic research cannot start from its own academic propositions like it did in the 19th and 20th centuries, and write an article for two to three hundred people to read it. The public will not know what is going on. That will not work. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So my work in Germany is to advocate a new research style, which does not start from academic propositions, but from public anxiety itself, using &quot;anxiety&quot; as the title, Come and study together. In other words, it is conversational research. Everyone has their own life and their own struggles, and the taste inside is different from what we see outside. Our output should be about how to deal with the world, giving thinking methods, concepts and theoretical perspectives, and triggering more discussions. For conversational research, communication in the public media is very important. This is my working method, not a supplementary one, but a fundamental working method. It’s not that I have any conclusions to tell you, but that they collide and deepen in the constant back and forth. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;What forms of communication have you received during this kind of dialogue and back-and-forth? feedback? After all, you haven’t opened an account at station B, so feedback is not given through barrage. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xiang Biao: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I find that contemporary art is particularly sensitive. In 2020, there will be four domestic exhibitions with the title &quot;Nearby&quot;. In fact, &quot;nearby&quot; is a very vague thing in academic terms. I didn&#39;t find it very interesting myself, I just mentioned it in a general way. The “nearby” concept received enthusiastic feedback. When I proposed the term “country squire,” the feedback I received was less enthusiastic and more questioning and critical. There are also some topics that I find interesting but receive a mediocre response from the public. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Someone will find my email online and write to me. It&#39;s not that the question he raised is meaningful in itself, but I will think about why he raised such a question. I know that some issues are universal, and I will have to observe them over a period of time. So feedback is not given directly to me, it requires a process. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Common Anxiety and Type 16 Personality&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 凯体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>; During your return to China, you chatted intensively with various people almost every day. Have you always been so talkative? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xiang Biao: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I haven’t tested it yet. I am not a very extroverted person. Sometimes I am a little socially anxious, and I have been insensitive to people&#39;s subjective emotions for a long time. I have always felt that I have mild autism. I read the biography of an analytical philosopher in Oxford. He often talked to others, but everyone found that he was indifferent to many common sense things and had no interest in interpersonal relationships. The understanding is very simple, but the analysis of some things can be very profound. I think this is very similar to me. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To be honest, I am quite introverted and afraid of eating with many people. When chatting on that occasion, few people can tell the complete story of their experiences. The content of the conversation can easily turn into various fragments, gossip, and extreme stories, many of which are hearsay. I&#39;m surprised that many intellectual elites also like to talk about this. In that environment, it was difficult for me to maintain myself. I became very quiet and wanted to end it quickly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Nowadays, it is very popular among Chinese young people to talk about type 16 personality. We often talk to each other Asked &quot;Are you an I person or an E person?&quot; What do you think of this phenomenon? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xiang Biao: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Personality classification is a very interesting phenomenon. It is not the same as young people’s original curiosity about psychology. If you want to understand your own mental state and understand yourself, it is now mainly a social tool. You know each other&#39;s type, and then you can profile each other, and then ask each other questions. But this question does not necessarily mean that you need to prescribe the right medicine (according to the other person&#39;s personality type). , but it means that there is no way to start communication with a natural word, and using personality classification can talk more safely. This has a lot to do with the role of social media. We are used to interacting with personas, that is, types of people and people in portraits, but we don’t quite know how to interact with the people themselves. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 凯体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Most academic research now revolves around topics , do you consider yourself a lucky person for having conversations and researching shared anxieties in this way? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xiang Biao: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I am very lucky. I was already very lucky in Oxford. When I arrived at the Max Planck Institute in Germany, the constraints on me became even more severe. Less, and it gives you a platform that encourages you to do weird things. In the direction of &quot;common anxiety&quot;, we have postdocs working on &quot;pressure&quot; in Africa, and some working on &quot;persistence&quot; in Latin America. In what specific life situations, what issues and in what ways do people make persistent investments? What can this teach us. This is different from a philosophical discussion; it is a very realistic observation. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Why do you pay special attention to &quot;anxiety&quot;? Why conduct conversational research starting from “shared anxieties” rather than, say, “shared concerns”? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xiang Biao: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Public concerns are often shaped by a mainstream discourse and can be easily expressed directly with some data. Concerns are integrated and conceptual. Anxiety is emotional and closer to the experience of life itself. For ordinary people, the purpose of life is not to criticize, but to live better. Of course, there are many things worthy of criticism, but only when they come out of the purpose of their lives can criticism be implemented and facilitate their actions, and then they can change lives and people&#39;s thinking under a seemingly unchangeable structure. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Studying anxiety is much more difficult than studying public concerns or a certain issue, because anxiety is a vague thing that cannot be explained clearly, let alone quantified. . This means that we must find new languages ​​and new ways of thinking. It is easy to follow the agenda, but it is also difficult to innovate. But starting from anxiety, we can better grasp the current new contradictions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;&quot;Anxiety&quot; has been a hot word for a long time in recent years. What are your observations on everyone’s anxiety? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xiang Biao: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;The anxiety is more serious than I thought, and it is very pervasive. I could see the current high incidence of mental illness from reports. Then through conversations with young people, chatting and contacting various people, I saw more from experience how people describe anxiety and how anxiety is. Spreading, including in intimate relationships, anxiety is amplified or distorted. At the same time, everyone realizes that they are anxious, which means that everyone is looking forward to a change, or at least a better way to respond to their situation. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One cause of anxiety is a disruption in our perception of life. When there is a huge swing in life, without adequate discussion and communication after the swing, ordinary people will not be able to form a complete understanding of the development of things. There must be various traumas involved. This trauma remains on ourselves. If we don’t handle it well, it will remain there forever and turn into fear, weakness, nervousness, violent reactions, etc. in our future. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;People often ask me, why don’t you criticize? In fact, criticism is still very important, but I focus more on analyzing the trauma on our bodies, how we treat it, and how to preserve our own strength. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 15 Nov 2023 18:25:03 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
