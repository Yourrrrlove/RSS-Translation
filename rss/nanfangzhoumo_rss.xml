The police collected blood from all the residents upstairs and compared the DNA on the cigarette butts, and successfully identified the suspect who threw the cigarette butts. This is another case of using high-tech means to identify the suspect of throwing objects from high altitude. It also reminds you again that throwing objects from high altitude is extremely harmful and the probability of police intervention to solve the case is greatly increased. Don’t take chances and try the law yourself. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to The Paper, at the end of August, Ms. Huang was taking her 4-month-old baby for a walk downstairs when an unextinguished cigarette butt fell from the sky and burned the child&#39;s shoulders and neck. Although the surveillance cameras in the community only cover one floor of the ground and there is no high-altitude surveillance, it is impossible to find out who threw the cigarette butt through the video. However, the police successfully found the suspect who threw the object at high altitude by collecting blood from all the residents upstairs to test DNA. Not only will this person be liable for civil torts, but he is also likely to be subject to criminal penalties. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The tall buildings provide us with more living and working space and have become a symbol of modernization. However, they also bring the risk of throwing and falling objects from high altitudes. Carrying high-speed kinetic energy converted from high-altitude potential energy, even an egg weighing tens of grams may cause serious injury, not to mention other dangerous items. In recent years, there have been constant news about vehicles being damaged by objects thrown and falling from heights, killing and injuring people. In 2016, an iron fitness ball fell from the sky in Suining, Sichuan, killing a baby girl under one year old; in 2020, another 14-month-old baby in Shaoxing, Zhejiang was hit in the head by a brick thrown from upstairs. Causing brain death...&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although it is unlikely that an unextinguished cigarette butt will injure someone, the risk of causing a fire or scalding someone is not small. In addition to the recent case in Zhengzhou, a similar case occurred in a community in Luzhou, Sichuan in 2021. A cigarette butt dropped from a high altitude burned through the roof of a baby car and almost burned the baby. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past, casualties or property losses caused by falling objects from high altitudes were usually dealt with as civil infringements, and the victims had to collect evidence on their own to prosecute. Unless the impact was extremely serious, the police generally would not intervene in the investigation. The individual&#39;s ability to collect evidence is naturally very weak, and in most cases the perpetrator cannot be found. What to do? The previous law stipulates that in this case, all &quot;possible perpetrators&quot; will be compensated. That is to say, once an incident involving a high-altitude object injuring someone occurs and the perpetrator cannot be found, all residents upstairs (except those who have evidence to prove their Those who are not the perpetrators (for example, if the building is vacant and no one lives in it, etc.) will be &quot;sitting together.&quot; Although this provision allows the victim to receive compensation, it is very unfair to those who did not throw things downstairs. It may even condone the perpetrators, because the consequences of the evil are shared by many people. This legal provision and related court decisions have caused great controversy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The key to solving the problem is to find the perpetrators and punish them severely. This aspect relies on technological progress, such as high-altitude video surveillance, DNA comparison and other technologies, which can help identify the perpetrators. On the other hand, there are changes in legal provisions. If you still let the victim collect evidence on his own, it will basically be impossible. Because individuals do not have the right to collect DNA from others for identification, there are no legal provisions, and properties have no incentive to install high-altitude surveillance systems. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Civil Code and Criminal Law Amendment (11), which will be implemented in 2021, has changed this rule. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the civil side, although the &quot;simultaneous sitting&quot; provisions still exist, the Civil Code requires the police to investigate in a timely manner in accordance with the law and identify the person responsible. The &quot;continuous sitting&quot; rule applies only when the police are unable to find out. As a result, it has become the legal duty of the police to identify the person responsible for falling objects from heights. The police have greater power and ability to conduct investigations. For example, they can narrow the scope of investigation based on the mobile phone signal at the location of the incident, and can force &quot;possible perpetrators&quot; to provide biological samples for DNA comparison. Through these technical means, the police can basically make the perpetrators invisible. Especially the DNA comparison is extremely shocking. In the case of a cigarette butt falling from the sky in Luzhou, Sichuan, which almost scalded a baby, the perpetrator voluntarily surrendered after the police completed the DNA analysis on the cigarette butt. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, the Civil Code also stipulates that property management companies and other building managers should take necessary safety measures to prevent infringement incidents of falling objects from high altitudes; otherwise, they will bear tort liability for failing to perform safety guarantee obligations. In this way, the property management company will have the motivation to do a good job in prevention, monitoring and other tasks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In terms of criminal liability, the judicial interpretation issued by the Supreme People&#39;s Court in 2019 stipulates that intentional throwing of objects from high altitude and negligent falling of objects from high altitude can be classified as &quot;crime of endangering public safety by dangerous means&quot; and &quot;negligence causing casualties.&quot; Convicted and punished for crimes such as &quot;serious accident crime&quot; and &quot;major liability accident crime&quot;. The Criminal Law Amendment (11), which took effect on March 1, 2021, has added the crime of &quot;throwing objects from high altitudes&quot;. Although the penalty for this crime is lighter than the penalty for &quot;crime of endangering public safety&quot;, the police must open a case to investigate the crime regardless of the severity. This also means that under the new criminal law, the threshold for criminal offenses for throwing objects from high altitudes has been lowered, and the police have greater legal responsibilities to conduct criminal investigations. In this way, the probability of the perpetrator being discovered will be greatly increased, the possibility and intensity of punishment will also be greatly increased, and the deterrence of high-altitude missiles will also be greatly increased. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Use technology to let the law grow teeth and form sufficient deterrence. Those who throw objects from high altitudes will be caught and severely punished. Those who throw objects from high altitudes will have nowhere to hide. With fewer people daring to test the law, the sky above our heads will be safer. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 19 Sep 2023 20:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[坚守大山十年，月薪不到三千：支教老师“中年危机”何解]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256942]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-19 19:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 19 Sep 2023 19:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[国铁集团：不可能给第三方平台“优先购票权”]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256988]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-19 18:31:42&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Today, the railway department began to sell train tickets for October 3, with sufficient tickets left in all directions. From September 28th to October 2nd, there are still tickets left. For tickets sold during the pre-sale period on and before September 27, there are sufficient remaining tickets in all directions. Based on passenger flow demand, tickets for the more than 100 additional passenger trains that the railway department will open during the holidays have been on sale since September 18, which can increase the passenger capacity by more than 70,000 seats per day. From September 13 to 18, the railway department sold a total of 111 million train tickets. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Based on passenger travel demand, the railway department has arranged to open more than 100 additional passenger trains during the National Day holiday. These trains will run on September 28, and tickets will go on sale on September 18. The main directions for adding trains are: Nanchang to Guangzhou, Wuhan to Guangzhou, Changsha to Nanchang, Nanchang to Shanghai, Xiamen to Shanghai, Shenzhen to Changsha, etc. Based on train ticket pre-sales, waitlist ticket purchase data and railway transportation capacity, the railway department will also open additional passenger trains in popular directions and hot time periods in a timely manner. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Passenger travel is highly concentrated during the holidays, and train tickets in some popular directions and hot periods are in short supply. Passengers can choose to buy tickets by waitlisting, transfer, etc., or according to the remaining tickets at different times and directions. , choose to travel during off-peak hours. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In recent years, EMU train fares have implemented a differentiated floating pricing mechanism, which is mainly based on market supply and demand and passenger flow patterns, with the published fare as the maximum price, and is implemented in time periods, seats, and sections. A multi-tier, high and low ticket price floating strategy. During this year&#39;s National Day holiday, high-speed rail still implements differentiated fares. For example, the fare for EMU trains between Beijing and Shanghai is as high as 667 yuan and as low as 404 yuan for second-class seats. Passengers can choose according to their needs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Railway 12306 has never authorized any third-party platform to sell train tickets, and it is impossible to give third-party platforms the so-called &quot;priority to purchase tickets.&quot; Third-party platforms will retain user information during the ticket purchase process of passengers and friends. Not only do they have traps such as surcharges, acceleration packages, and bundled sales services, but they may also risk personal information leakage. Passengers please be sure to purchase tickets through official railway channels, look for the railway 12306 website (including the client), and pay attention to protecting legitimate rights and interests and the security of personal information. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 19 Sep 2023 18:55:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[治理矿山安全：实时监测八十余万名入井作业人员]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256970]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-19 18:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/19/SOkEroGpwkCPUDcHjKEN2TlsHU9Tjaruh9apHTj2.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;480&quot; height=&quot;358&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/19/SOkEroGpwkCPUDcHjKEN2TlsHU9Tjaruh9apHTj2. png&quot; data-key=&quot;251165&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On the morning of September 18, 2023, the State Council Information Office held a meeting on further strengthening mine safety. Opinions on Production Work&quot; press conference. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Du Hansan/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Local regulatory and supervisory departments and national supervisory agencies have connected all normal production and construction coal mines to the Internet. Sensory data such as safety monitoring, personnel positioning, and video surveillance can monitor more than 600,000 sensors, more than 800,000 well workers, and 39,000 household operating video surveillance data across the country in real time, and develop a variety of risk analysis and early warning functions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the morning of September 18, 2023, the State Council Information Office held a press conference on the &quot;Opinions on Further Strengthening Mine Safety Production Work&quot; (hereinafter referred to as the &quot;Opinions&quot;). Deputy Director of the National Mine Safety Supervision Bureau Zhang Xin said that the opinions &quot;strive to fundamentally eliminate hidden dangers of accidents and fundamentally solve problems&quot; and further promote the transformation of the mine safety management model to pre-emptive prevention. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Opinions&quot; is the first programmatic document in the field of mine safety production issued with the approval of the Party Central Committee and the State Council since the founding of the People&#39;s Republic of China. It proposes a series of measures around &quot;preventive transformation&quot;, which is the first time at the national level. It is clearly required that the headquarters of mining-related central enterprises and large and medium-sized mining-related enterprises be equipped with safety directors, and it is required to standardize the management of outsourced projects in non-coal mines. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Opinions&quot; require standardizing the management of outsourced projects in non-coal mines. The contracting unit dispatches project leaders, technical personnel and special operations personnel to the project department, and proposes to strive to establish the unit&#39;s own mining operations in production mines by the end of 2025. (Peel) the construction team or entrust an enterprise with corresponding conditions for overall management. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sun Qingguo, director of the Safety Basics Department of the National Mine Safety Supervision Bureau, introduced that after the issuance of the &quot;Several Provisions on Strengthening the Safety Management of Metal and Non-Metal Underground Mine Outsourcing Projects&quot; in 2021, a total of 1,360 inspection teams were organized across the country. More than 6,800 people were dispatched, which lasted 7 months, to inspect 3,895 outsourced engineering mines, resource integration coal mines and managed coal mines, and 134 major hidden dangers were discovered, during which 461 outsourcing teams were dismissed or transferred to others. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sun Qingguo pointed out that through special rectification, the management of outsourced projects in non-coal mines has been further standardized and the management level has been greatly improved. “However, there are still inconsistent management of personnel teams, illegal contracting and subcontracting, and suspended safety responsibilities. , issues such as insufficient investment in safety.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Opinions&quot; further requires the management of outsourced projects in non-coal mines, clarifies the safety responsibilities of non-coal mines, and regulates the number of contracting units for metal and non-metal underground mines, the staffing and academic qualifications of contracting units, and blasting operations. As well as establishing its own mining team, clear requirements have been put forward. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;Without control of disasters, there will be no peace for mines. The management of major disasters is always the top priority in promoting advance prevention.&quot; Zhang Xin said that the next step will be to carry out regular and institutionalized surveys and management of hidden disaster factors in mines. To achieve the transformation from passive prevention to active management, from single treatment to comprehensive treatment, and from underground partial treatment to surface area treatment, &quot;anything that has not been identified, explored, and not treated in place shall be allowed to carry out mining operations, and we must not cooperate with it.&quot; Disasters are &#39;fighting with bayonets.&#39;&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Feng, director of the Non-Coal Mine Safety Supervision Department, said that in the future, not only will the investigation and rectification of major hidden dangers not be in place, the companies and responsible persons responsible for the accident will be held accountable, and the investigation and rectification will not be in place. Enterprises that cause major hidden dangers to still exist must also be held accountable, &quot;reflecting the concept of transforming the mine safety management model to pre-emptive prevention.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 19 Sep 2023 18:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[小城千人围捕鳄鱼：已追回69条，仍有两条或在逃]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256981]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-19 17:31:29&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/19/598242ea15.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;810&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/19/598242ea15. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251197&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Crocodile capture scene.

A pickup truck drove up from the night and stopped in the middle of the nearby road. In the truck was a freshly caught crocodile. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Qiu Gui, a 43-year-old crocodile catcher, pulled the crocodile by its tail and dragged it out of the pickup truck with his team members. They were about to transfer the crocodile to the van, where three crocodiles were already tied up. The crocodile was dragged to the back of the truck, its limbs were tied to its sides, and its long mouth was tied with tape so that it could not open or close. Qiu Gui and three other team members wearing headlamps stood on both sides of the crocodile, holding its limbs and pushing upward together: &quot;One, two!&quot; The people standing in the carriage pulled the hemp rope around the crocodile&#39;s head and also Together they exerted upward force, and the crocodile successfully entered the &quot;cage&quot;. When untying the hemp rope, a crocodile in the carriage seemed to be very angry and threw its big head with its mouth tied tightly at the people on the side. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Affected by Typhoon Haikui, Maoming City, Guangdong Province suffered from heavy rains for days. On September 11, floods destroyed the fence of a crocodile farm in Luocun, the northern boundary, causing some crocodiles to escape. According to Nanfang+ news, there are a total of 71 crocodiles in the farm. As of September 16, a total of 69 crocodiles have been captured, and there have been no incidents of crocodile injuries. Currently, multiple search teams are still hunting the last two escaped crocodiles day and night. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/19/3846f4d486.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/19/3846f4d486.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251198&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The farm where the crocodile escaped.

This is a crocodile species commonly found in breeding farms in Hainan, Guangdong and other places. According to relevant literature, there are no wild Siamese crocodiles in China, only breeding populations, which can be traded and operated with a license. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The company owned by the crocodile farm where the incident occurred is the Guangdong Yufeng Crocodile Breeding Professional Cooperative, which was established in March 2019. Its legal representative is Xu Jinwang. With tens of thousands of crocodiles being farmed and more than 20 years of breeding experience, Mao celebrity Xu Jinwang is known as the &quot;Crocodile King&quot;. Xu Jinwang&#39;s wife, Ke Yiming, told Southern Weekend reporters that after the crocodile escaped, they were under great pressure and suffered a huge loss, amounting to two to three million yuan. &quot;The crocodile is very valuable.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to Wu Liming, an 81-year-old villager in Luo Village, Beijie, the fish pond used by Xu Jinwang to breed crocodiles was rented to him four or five years ago, totaling more than 30 acres, with an annual rent of 2,000 yuan. /acre, rented for 18 years. Wu Liming told Southern Weekend reporters that after the crocodile escaped and the flood level had not receded, he called Xu Jinwang every day out of fear: &quot;Let him take care of it, (the crocodile) is very dangerous.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt; p>;Ke Yiming explained that the flooding of the breeding farm was a natural disaster. &quot;We (the breeding farm) have done everything very safely. The floods there are so severe that we will not dare to raise them there in the future.&quot; On September 15, a Southern Weekend reporter saw at the scene , each crocodile pool is separated by a plastic baffle about 1.3 meters high. As to whether the use of plastic baffles can effectively prevent the crocodiles from escaping, Qiu Gui, a professional crocodile catcher with more than 20 years of experience, explained to Southern Weekend reporters: &quot;This The baffle is OK. As long as the crocodile can&#39;t see outside, it will stay in the crocodile pond.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The news of the crocodile&#39;s escape frightened 75-year-old villager Wu Yanxin: &quot;I&#39;m scared. Why aren&#39;t you afraid?&quot; Wu Yanxin lives in Dapo Village, Zhensheng Town, about 400 meters away from the crocodile farm. Although he was scared, Wu Yanxin had a way to comfort himself: as long as he didn&#39;t go into the water or go to the shore, &quot;crocodiles don&#39;t walk that fast on the ground.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before the crocodile escaped, Wu Yanxin often cycled and ran along the road around Pengcun Lake, taking 70 minutes to run an 8-kilometer lap. This is the largest body of water around the crocodile pond. Standing on the road around the lake, Wu Yanxin can see the crocodiles living in the pond. After the crocodile escaped, Wu Yanxin could no longer ride around the lake. The road was surrounded by a 1.5-meter-high wire fence to prevent the crocodile from hurting anyone. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/19/333bc75667.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;810&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/19/333bc75667.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251199&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Huanhu Road is surrounded by barbed wire.

On September 17, Zhou Hui told Southern Weekend reporters that after the crocodile escaped, they began to install protective nets along Huanhu Road. It took about three or four days to complete the installation, and then spent several days reinforcing it. One morning around 1 a.m., he and his colleagues were installing a protective net on the road to the crocodile pond. About 20 meters away, a crocodile surfaced and opened its mouth, then sank into the water; another weighed three to four hundred pounds. The crocodiles were lying on the shore 50 meters away. Zhou Hui took a light and found two yellow eyes staring at them. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wu Yahong, the person in charge of supervision of the Crocodile Farm Residents Group, told Southern Weekend reporters that after the crocodile escaped, the village committee actively participated in catching the crocodile and arranged on-duty duty to ask the villagers not to go out and pay attention to safety. Wu Yahong said that when there were heavy rains in the past, he would remind the staff in the crocodile farm to pay attention to safety: &quot;The water has almost reached your crocodile pond, and the crocodiles have escaped. But this time the water is too big, and the crocodile pond has been soaked.&quot; ), the crocodile ran out.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A staff member of the adjacent Dapo Village Committee told Southern Weekend reporters that after the crocodile escaped, in order to ensure that there were no casualties, &quot;we launched There are more than 30 party members and volunteers, guarding various checkpoints 24 hours a day.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to capture the crocodile as soon as possible and ensure the safety of nearby residents, the 5-kilometer radius around the incident site is a key investigation area. A total of 51 outposts, 33 patrol teams, and nearly 1,000 staff were set up in the area to carry out arrests. On September 15, a militiaman on duty told Southern Weekend reporters that the day the crocodiles first escaped, the water level was still very high, and the farm was full of people. Everyone was busy pumping water and holding sandbags to block the water. &quot;If you are not afraid of the crocodiles appearing, then There are so many people, what are you afraid of, the special police are all armed with guns.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/19/fb508a3153.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;626&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/19/fb508a3153.png&quot; data-key=&quot;251200&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In order to find crocodiles, the farm conducts water surveys.

The nearest gunshot to him was on the night of September 14, when a crocodile weighing two to three hundred pounds was found in a small drainage ditch near his family&#39;s paddy field. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Shooting a crocodile in the water is not easy. &quot;When you shoot it, it goes into the water. It&#39;s not like those on the ground, where it stays in place.&quot; A special police officer holding a sniper rifle said. A colleague on the side gave him an idea, &quot;Someone has to fill in the gun.&quot; . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/19/187650e8d2.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;810&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/19/187650e8d2.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251201&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;SWAT searches for an escaped alligator. Photo by Southern Weekend reporter Zhao Ming &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Compared with shooting crocodiles in the water, Qiu Gui believes that finding crocodiles is the most important and most time-consuming link. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to find the escaped crocodiles, the local area used sonar detection, drone inspections, and even tied ducks to the shore to lure the crocodiles to prey. A staff member of the sonar team told a reporter from Southern Weekend that the difficulty in detecting crocodiles with sonar is that it is difficult to detect crocodiles when they are swimming. The sound produced by drones usually scares timid crocodiles. The duck trapping effect is even weaker. The water area within which the crocodile escapes is large and there are many fish and shrimps. The crocodile has no shortage of food at all. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Qiu Gui has his own methods after dealing with crocodiles for more than 20 years. In this arrest operation, including at the breeding farm, their team of six arrested a total of 56 animals, with the most on September 14, when 14 were captured. The remaining 13 were killed by special police and captured by crocodile catching teams from Zhanjiang, Yangjiang, Guangzhou and Foshan. Most of the crocodiles caught weighed more than 200 kilograms. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Qiu Gui and his party usually go out at night, because crocodiles are more alert during the day and will quickly hide in the water after noticing any movement around them. At night, crocodiles often stay in one place and are relatively slow. You can catch them by moving slowly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Unlike humans, crocodile eyes do not close from birth to death. Therefore, as long as you shine a flashlight at night, the yellow-glow eyes will reveal the location of the crocodile. At 2 a.m. on September 18, while searching for the last two crocodiles, Qiu Gui boarded the kayak again and searched for traces of crocodiles in Pengcun Lake. The night before, they found and captured three crocodiles here. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Qiu Gui pointed the flashlight at the water and grass on the shore. He explained that the crocodile likes to come ashore at nine or ten o&#39;clock in the morning when the sun is getting warmer. Basking in the sun will make it easier for it to digest food in its stomach. A 200-pound crocodile can eat 10 pounds a day. After it is full, it will come ashore. If it is not frightened, it will stay until it has finished digesting and then go into the water to hunt. &quot;There is not much knowledge to find crocodiles, and there is no shortcut, just use a lamp to shine.&quot; Qiu Gui said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Crocodiles at night are easier to find and catch. After Qiu Gui and his party discovered the crocodile, they would carefully move the boat closer and stun the crocodile within one meter of the crocodile. &quot;After the stun, the crocodile&#39;s body seemed to be stiff.&quot; Taking advantage of the 10-15 minutes when the crocodile was unconscious, the capture team The crocodile man drags the crocodile onto the boat and binds its mouth and limbs as soon as possible. &quot;As long as you tie its mouth and don&#39;t let it open, the crocodile will be 100% controlled.&quot; Qiu Gui said that the most important thing is teamwork, and nothing can be done without tacit understanding. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A tied up crocodile is equally dangerous. After the crocodile wakes up, its head and tail can still attack. If it hits the leg, &quot;it will break the leg directly, no joke.&quot; Qiu Gui said that the crocodile has an attack range. &quot;We usually stand in the middle of it, which is equivalent to its blind spot. But we should also stay 1.5 meters away from it, which will be safer.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt; p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/19/eabb6219cc.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; data- src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/19/eabb6219cc.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251202&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text -align: center;&quot;>;A crocodile was captured near a fence.

One of the focuses of the search that day was several fish ponds. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The fish pond is located in Helijing Village, only two to three hundred meters away from the crocodile farm. On September 15, the owner of a fish pond told Southern Weekend reporters that two crocodiles had been pulled into his fish pond. One was electrocuted and the other was shot. There may be crocodiles in the fish pond. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Because the fish pond is three to four meters deep and there are many fish, methods such as electric shock, duck trapping and even shooting are ineffective. A staff member of the Maoming Emergency Management Bureau told a Southern Weekend reporter: &quot;The water is too deep to find the crocodiles. It would be best if they could be put into water about one meter deep.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Initially, the village Negotiations between the committee and fish pond owners on the compensation plan after the water was released did not go smoothly. Cai Fang, the wife of the above-mentioned pond owner, told Southern Weekend reporters that tens of thousands of fry were put into her fish pond, as well as some fish feed. &quot;The total cost is tens of thousands of yuan. Now we propose to pump half of the water and compensate for 2,000 yuan.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Cai Fang does not agree with the compensation plan. She believes that if half of the water is drained, the remaining fish will He died of lack of oxygen and was worried that the crocodile would not be found hiding in the mud at the bottom of the pond. &quot;What if someone is bitten later, will I, the pond owner, be responsible?&quot; Cai Fang hoped that a thorough search could be carried out and the pond water could be drained. , make sure there are no crocodiles in the pond, and also handle the fish in the pond casually. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After several rounds of negotiations, on the evening of September 15, the two parties reached a compensation agreement at a price of 1,000 yuan per mu of water surface. Early the next morning, an excavator dug up the edge of the pond. After searching, no trace of the crocodile was found in the fish pond. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As of September 16, a total of 69 crocodiles have been captured, but there are still two cases with no clues. After another two days of searching, this data has not changed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/19/9f921aceea.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/19/9f921aceea.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251203&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The capture team searched the lake at night.

They suspected that the two crocodiles May have died during breeding. &quot;Crocodiles are the most ferocious during the mating season. They will fight for the right to mate. If they fight too hard, some crocodiles will die.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the early morning of September 19, the scope of the crocodile search The crocodile hunter&#39;s team began to search along the lower reaches of Pengcun Lake, one kilometer away from the crocodile farm. The search was still fruitless all night long. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;If the last two are not found, we will not stop the work.&quot; said the above-mentioned Maoming Emergency Management Bureau staff member. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(At the request of the interviewees, Zhou Hui and Cai Fang are pseudonyms)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt; p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 19 Sep 2023 17:55:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[被指定居所监视居住者离世：公安称其余同案人员“不应当追究刑责”]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256978]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-19 17:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/19/sA6bxukyIFAQtylG7MLw3gnjOtDGltCBo6F8Vjfv.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1269&quot; height=&quot;951&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/19/sA6bxukyIFAQtylG7MLw3gnjOtDGltCBo6F 8Vjfv. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251184&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Bao Qinrui was once placed under residential surveillance at a designated location in Xinle Hotel. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern Weekend reporter Han Qian/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As of September 19, 2023, Bao Qinrui has been dead for 426 days, but his wife Bao Linlin and her family have not yet received the conclusion of the death investigation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Bao Qinrui was from Shijiazhuang City, Hebei Province. He was once placed under residential surveillance at a designated location for picking quarrels and provoking trouble. He died 13 days later at the age of 33. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Residential surveillance is a coercive measure stipulated in the Criminal Procedure Law. Residential surveillance at a designated residence is a special situation: when the criminal suspect or defendant has no fixed residence, or the case is suspected of crimes endangering national security or terrorist activities, it can be implemented in a designated residence. Commonly used locations in practice include hotels, guest houses, hospitals, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although Bao Qinrui has a house in Yuhua District, Shijiazhuang, he was still placed under residential surveillance in Xinle City (a county-level city under the jurisdiction of Shijiazhuang). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Medical records show that the person who accompanied Bao Qinrui to the hospital was a staff member of the Xinle City Public Security Bureau, and the &quot;work unit or home address&quot; column was filled in with Xinle Hotel. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the reply from the Xinle City Public Security Bureau to Bao Qinrui’s father, on July 19, 2022, the day of the incident, the Shijiazhuang City Procuratorate intervened in the matter and investigated Bao Qinrui’s death. In the meantime, his body has been stored in the Xinle City Funeral Home and has not been cremated. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;The investigation into the cause of death has stalled&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Bao Linlin remembers that in the early morning of July 7, 2022, Bao Qinrui was taken away by the police at his home in Yuhua District Walk. Later, she received a notice mailed by the Xinle City Public Security Bureau, which stated that Bao Qinrui was placed under residential surveillance at a designated residence because he was &quot;suspected of picking quarrels and provoking trouble.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Bao Linlin saw her husband again at the Xinle City Funeral Home. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The rescue records of Xinle City Hospital record that at 21:38 on July 19, 2022, the hospital received an emergency call, and Bao Qinrui was subsequently sent to the hospital. After more than three hours of continuous resuscitation, Bao Qinrui was still unconscious, without spontaneous breathing and heartbeat, and the hospital declared him dead. Xinle City 110 police officers signed at 1:38 a.m. the next day and contacted the Xinle City Funeral Home. The hospital recommended an autopsy to further clarify the cause of death. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Eight months after Bao Qinrui’s death, on the morning of March 30, 2023, the Shijiazhuang City Procuratorate arranged for an autopsy on Bao Qinrui’s body. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Bao Qinrui’s father Bao Jiye recalled to Southern Weekend reporters that on June 19, 2023, the Shijiazhuang Municipal Procuratorate presented him with an autopsy report, which concluded that “mechanical injury was excluded as a cause of death.” &quot;, it excludes death caused by poisoning, and does not rule out sinus node disease causing cardiac electrical activity disorder and cardiac arrest leading to death.&quot; Bao Jiye did not sign the report and applied for a second autopsy to be performed by an agency commissioned by the family. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The investigation into the cause of Bao Qinrui’s death has stalled. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Bao Jiye asked Cao Zhi, the prosecutor of the Shijiazhuang City Procuratorate who participated in the investigation. Cao Zhi replied that a second autopsy needs to be applied to the Xinle City Public Security Bureau. Xinle City Public Security Bureau staff replied to Bao Jiye that this application should be communicated to the Shijiazhuang City Procuratorate, &quot;The Public Security Bureau is also a party, and you don&#39;t believe it even if we do an autopsy.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the afternoon of September 18, 2023, Cao Zhi said in an interview with a reporter from Southern Weekend that there is currently no investigation conclusion on Bao Qinrui’s death. As for whether a second autopsy can be performed, &quot;this is an internal investigation process and cannot be announced to the outside world.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Regulations on Handling the Death of Persons in Detention Centers&quot; jointly issued by the Supreme People&#39;s Procuratorate, the Ministry of Public Security, and the Ministry of Civil Affairs stipulate that when institutions commissioned by the public security organs and procuratorates conduct autopsies, the opinions of the deceased&#39;s close relatives should be solicited. Close relatives who request to entrust another institution to conduct an autopsy should be allowed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, if a person dies during residential surveillance at a designated location, there are no clear regulations yet on whether family consent is required when an autopsy is commissioned. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Co-defendant&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Bailed&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Bao Linlin still doesn’t know about Bao Qinrui What specific behavior is suspected of provoking quarrels and provoking trouble? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the same day as Bao Qinrui, there were eight other people who were placed under residential surveillance at a designated location - Bao Qinrui&#39;s father Bao Jiye, brother Bao Shaorui, uncles Bao Jizhong and Bao Jitao, and his cousin. Diba Zhuorui and three other villagers from the same village were all suspected of provoking quarrels and causing trouble, and the execution location was also Xinle Hotel. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;More than a month after Bao Qinrui passed away, on September 1, 2022, Bao Jiye and Bao Shaorui were released on bail pending trial. On September 28, the other six people, including Bao Jizhong and Bao Jitao, were released on bail pending trial. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;All eight people said they were beaten and given electric shocks while under residential surveillance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Two days after Bao Qinrui’s death, on the afternoon of July 22, 2022, Bao Jitao, who was still under residential surveillance, was sent to Xinle City Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital for treatment due to fever. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to Bao Jitao&#39;s hospitalization record, when he was admitted to the hospital, he had &quot;pain in both calves for 3-4 days, pain in the left chest and ribs for 1 day, skin damage and scabs on the left knee, and flakes on the right lower limb.&quot; Bruises and red rashes can be seen on both calves.” After experiencing chest pain, he was diagnosed with left rib fracture after examination. After being hospitalized for 7 days, Bao Jitao was discharged from the hospital on July 29. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On June 19, 2023, the Xinle City Public Security Bureau lifted the bail pending trial for eight people on the grounds that &quot;it was found that criminal liability should not be pursued.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;The whistleblower expressed a &quot;reversal&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;On the notice of release on bail pending trial that Bao Jiye received, it was written that the case he was involved in was &quot;5• 25 project&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Bao Jiye and Bao Shaorui recalled that during the residential surveillance period, the police asked them whether they had beaten Sun Huiqiang and others who came to ask for wages. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Bao Qinrui and other nine people involved in the case are all from Nantaying Village, Gaoyi County, Shijiazhuang City. Before the incident, Bao Qinrui worked in the Gaoyi County Housing and Urban-Rural Development Bureau. Bao Jiye runs a ceramic tile factory in Gaoyi, and Bao Shaorui, Bao Jitao, and Bao Zhuorui all work in the factory. Bao Jizhong is the party branch secretary of Nantaying Village. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sun Huiqiang is a contractor who participated in the construction of Bao Jiye’s ceramic tile factory in 2013 and 2014. He told Southern Weekend reporters that on May 22, 2022, at a worker’s home, police from the Yuhua District Public Security Bureau took notes on him and five other workers involved in the construction. At that time, he and the workers said that in the spring of 2014, they went to the ceramic tile factory to ask for wages and were beaten by Bao Jiye, Bao Jizhong and others. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But on September 12, 2023, Sun Huiqiang said in an interview with a Southern Weekend reporter that he gave false testimony at that time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to Sun Huiqiang&#39;s account, he and Bao Jiye did have a financial dispute at the beginning of 2022. There was a discrepancy of 200,000 yuan between the two parties regarding the amount of project funds, and they were in the negotiation stage at that time. Bao Moumou (pseudonym), a villager from the same village as Bao Jiye, contacted him and said that he had conflicts with Bao Jizhong, who served as the party branch secretary in the village.暴某某许诺，只要孙会强按他说的做，不但工程款能要回来，甚至比他要求的数目更高。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;得知暴钦瑞出事后，2022年9月、2023年6月，孙会强和工人们又重新向公安机关作了笔录，重新说明情况，表明自己没有被暴继业、暴记忠等人殴打。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2023年4月，暴继业注意到，短视频平台上又出现了对他“涉黑涉恶”的举报。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;其中一人是66岁的张书科，同样和暴继业就工程款的数目有些争议。 2023年4月21日，网名为“窦娥冤”的用户在短视频平台上发布了一则题为“真人真事绝不骗人”的视频：张书科手持身份证讲述，“实名举报高邑县以暴继业、暴记忠为首的黑社会团伙，以欺诈手段恶意欠我工程款60万。我去要账，遭到多次殴打、辱骂，并扬言再到厂里要账，打死活埋”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;暴继业以侵犯名誉权为由起诉张书科。 2023年6月7日，高邑县法院对此案进行调解。双方达成协议：张书科删除上述视频，并录视频向暴继业道歉。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;不过，目前短视频平台上仍能搜索到这条视频。张书科向南方周末记者解释，视频中所说内容并不真实，自己没有被暴继业殴打，视频是在暴某某建议下录制的。当时，暴某某告诉他，“把事情说严重点就有人管你，说实情就没人管。”法院调解后，他曾联系暴某某删除视频，但暴某某也删不了。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2023年9月18日，南方周末记者联系上暴某某。他提供的说法与孙会强、张书科不同。他表示，是暴继业、暴记忠等人取保候审后，通过“威逼利诱”的方式，收买举报人，让他们翻供。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;什么是“住处”？ &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;儿子离世后，暴继业疑惑的是，自己是石家庄市高邑县人，为什么由新乐市公安局执行指定居所监视居住？ &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;监视居住是刑事诉讼法中规定的5种强制措施之一。北京大学法学院教授陈永生解释，5种强制措施的强制力度是梯级结构，由弱到强分别是拘传、取保候审、监视居住、拘留和逮捕。监视居住作为一种过渡措施，意味着犯罪嫌疑人或被告人不需要像拘留、逮捕那样完全关押，但要求不能离开住所。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;对符合逮捕条件的犯罪嫌疑人或被告人，3种情况下可以采取监视居住措施，一是因自身因素，患有严重疾病、怀孕等；二是案件特殊性或者办案需要；三是羁押期限届满,案件尚未办结,为了避免超期羁押,实行监视居住。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;指定居所监视居住则是监视居住的一种特殊情形。刑事诉讼法中规定了两类可以指定居所监视居住的情况：犯罪嫌疑人或被告人无固定住处，或是案件涉嫌危害国家安全犯罪、恐怖活动犯罪。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;全国人大常委会法制工作委员会编写的《中华人民共和国刑事诉讼法释义》对“住处”的解释是，犯罪嫌疑人、被告人在办案机关所在地的市、县内生活、工作的合法住所。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;而涉案9人都在高邑县有住所，暴钦瑞、暴韶瑞在裕华区也有房产。陈永生认为，只要当事人在石家庄市内有房产，按照法律规定，就不符合适用指定居所的情形。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2023年9月15日下午，新乐市公安局一位副局长告诉暴继业，此案由石家庄市公安局裕华分局、新乐市公安局和高邑县公安局三方组成专案组，联合办案。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但为何最终由新乐市公安局对暴钦瑞等9人执行指定居所监视居住？ 2023年9月18日，南方周末记者短信联系新乐市公安局局长郭杰，截至发稿，尚未收到回复。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 19 Sep 2023 17:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[3D重现利比亚极端洪水，上万人身亡，大量高楼被夷为平地]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256966]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-19 16:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 19 Sep 2023 16:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[从奥本海默到“核武之王”，这70年经历了什么？丨智库视点]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256964]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-19 15:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/19/r6FiloQ2QNq1q67PqYHr7zhROxZiFIGrf2SP6ELu.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;750&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/19/r6FiloQ2QNq1q67PqYHr7zhROxZiFI Grf2SP6ELu. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251162&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On December 15, 1957, local time, in Princeton, the United States, the creator of the atomic bomb, Robert Oppenheimer. A new film about Oppenheimer&#39;s life and his leadership in creating the world&#39;s first atomic bomb during World War II will be released in theaters on July 21, 2023, local time. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among the summer movies, &quot;Oppenheimer&quot; is one of the most eye-catching ones. The protagonist in the film is Julius Robert Oppenheimer, a genius Jewish scientist known as the &quot;Father of the Atomic Bomb&quot;. His &quot;work&quot; directly changed the face of the world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Recently, as the conflict between Russia and Ukraine continues to escalate, at a critical moment when the Ukrainian army launches a large-scale counterattack, Russia demonstrated a powerful weapon-the &quot;Sarmat&quot; land-based intercontinental ballistic missile. This giant intercontinental missile has been put on combat readiness to prepare for possible crises. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From Oppenheimer to &quot;Sarmat&quot;, what has happened in the past 70 years? Let&#39;s review the history of nuclear weapons. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Oppenheimer&#39;s &quot;Legacy&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Oppenheimer, a name closely associated with the atomic bomb and the &quot;Manhattan Project.&quot; This Jewish genius scientist has shown extraordinary talents since he was a child. In his childhood, he was influenced by his mother and dabbled in various fields such as art, literature, philosophy, history, science and language. The youngest member of the Mineral Club, he graduated with first place from Fieldston School of Arts and Sciences in New York at the age of 18 (many political, business and cultural celebrities in the United States came from this school) and was admitted to the Department of Chemistry at Harvard University. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After graduating from college, Oppenheimer first entered the famous Cavendish Laboratory of the University of Cambridge in England. After that, Oppenheimer was taught by the founder of quantum mechanics and the winner of the 1954 Nobel Prize in Physics. Born’s recommendation led him to the famous University of Göttingen. In 1927, Oppenheimer received his PhD for his research in quantum mechanics and decided to return to the United States not long after. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The highlight of his life was presiding over the United States&#39; nuclear weapons project, the &quot;Manhattan Project.&quot; As the commander-in-chief of the &quot;Manhattan Project&quot;, which cost US$2.5 billion and involved more than 500,000 people at its peak, Oppenheimer fully demonstrated his scientific literacy and management skills. In the movie, Oppenheimer called the project a &quot;gamble&quot; - he won the bet, and the United States also won the bet: at 5:30 in the morning on July 16, 1945, the first atomic bomb in human history was dropped on Los Angeles A successful explosion in the Alamos Desert. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For the rest of his life, Oppenheimer suffered from humiliation and trouble because of this project that brought him great fame. The movie &quot;Oppenheimer&quot; vividly reproduces how he was persecuted by politicians represented by McCarthyism and General Strauss. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On February 18, 1967, Oppenheimer died of throat cancer at the age of 63. What legacy did he leave to the world in the half century that followed? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As of early 2020, data from the Stockholm Peace Research Institute shows that the United States, Russia, the United Kingdom, France and other countries possess approximately 13,400 nuclear weapons, of which 3,720 have been deployed with combat troops, and approximately 1,800 of them are on high alert. . These nuclear weapons are specifically carried by a variety of delivery systems, including land- and sea-based long-range ballistic missiles, heavy bombers, fighter-bombers, air- and sea-launched cruise missiles, air defense and missile defense interceptor missiles, torpedoes, and depth charges . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hans Christensen, director of the &quot;Nuclear Information Project&quot; of the Federation of American Scientists, believes that both the United States and Russia possess very large nuclear arsenals, backed by short-range tactical nuclear forces, including intercontinental ballistic missiles, Sea-launched ballistic missiles and aircraft capable of carrying nuclear weapons constitute the &quot;trinity&quot; of long-range strategic nuclear forces. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some other countries have &quot;two-in-one&quot; medium-range nuclear forces and/or long-range nuclear forces (that is, they have any two of the three elements of the &quot;trinity&quot;). Some are transitioning to the &quot;Trinity&quot;, and there are rumors that Israel may already have the &quot;Trinity&quot; nuclear power. In addition, Pakistan and India possess short-range nuclear weapons. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It can be said that after 70 years of development, nuclear weapons have not only changed the form of military struggle, but also had a profound impact on the development of human society and the international strategic pattern. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;The birth of the &quot;King of Nuclear Weapons&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Sarmat&quot; intercontinental ballistic missile was born in a time of crisis. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the disintegration of the Soviet Union, Russia, which inherited its legacy, is not comparable to the Soviet Union in terms of armed force building. Unlike the Soviet Union, Russia is a resource-based country and therefore far inferior to its rival NATO in terms of conventional weapons. Nuclear power has therefore increasingly become the core of Russia&#39;s military power. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Land-based nuclear forces are the foundation and pillar of Russia’s “trinity” nuclear forces. Russia&#39;s nuclear power was inherited from the Soviet Union. The three old intercontinental ballistic missile systems of SS-18 &quot;Satan&quot;, SS-19 &quot;Dagger&quot; and SS-25 &quot;Topol&quot; installed by the Strategic Rocket Force account for half of Russia&#39;s land-based nuclear weapons delivery vehicles. As mentioned above, these three old missile systems will reach the end of their service life. Once decommissioned, it will have a huge impact on the stability of Russia&#39;s strategic nuclear forces. Therefore, Russia decided to develop a new intercontinental ballistic missile to replace the SS-18 that is about to be retired. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2009, the &quot;Sarmat&quot; intercontinental ballistic missile was developed by the Makeev Design Bureau. It conducted ejection tests in December 2017 and March 2018 and achieved success. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In terms of performance, this &quot;national weapon&quot; that Russia has high hopes for is really amazing. &quot;Sarmat&quot; is about 35 meters long, about 3 meters in diameter, has a take-off weight of about 200 tons, a payload of up to 10 tons, and a range of up to 17,000 kilometers. The hit accuracy is about 200 meters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Sarmat&quot; adopts a cold launch scheme. During launch, a gunpowder accumulator is used to eject the missile to a height of 20-30 meters above the launch silo, and then the missile ignites itself and takes off. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Sarmat&quot; can carry up to 10 heavy or 15 light independently targeted separately guided nuclear warheads, or 24 &quot;Vanguard&quot; hypersonic boost glide bombs, which can target different targets Deliver devastating strikes and identify attacks from multiple targets. When carrying 10 submissive warheads, the yield of each warhead reaches 750,000 tons of TNT. The missile warhead adopts a variety of advanced penetration technologies, such as stealth technology and materials, separately guided multiple warheads and decoy bombs, hypersonic boost-glide warheads, and maneuverable and flexible orbit-changing capabilities. Its strike power is equivalent to 1,600 times that of the atomic bomb exploded in Hiroshima. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Sarmat&quot; has three unique skills. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First, hit far. This type of missile has a range of 17,000 kilometers. The ultra-long range allows this missile to be launched from any area in Russia and can effectively hit predetermined targets around the world. It is speculated that the &quot;Sarmat&quot; can fly over the Antarctic, completely bypassing all current U.S. missile defense systems, and strike against the United States. Others speculate that it has partial orbital bombing capabilities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The second is to play skillfully. This cleverness is reflected in the super defense penetration ability. In modern warfare, the penetration capability of surface-to-surface missiles has increasingly become an important indicator for measuring the comprehensive technical level of missiles. This type of missile uses stealth technology and materials in its shape design and coating. The missile&#39;s boost section is short, which makes it more difficult for enemy radars and satellites to detect, track and intercept. The powerful power gives it an ultra-long range, the ability to fly over both poles to carry out attacks, and may even have partial orbital bombing capabilities to avoid anti-missile systems to the greatest extent. The missile can carry more than ten separately guided warheads and use multiple decoy warheads at the same time, which greatly improves the identification difficulty of the anti-missile system and its own penetration probability. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, the &quot;Sarmat&quot; can also carry the &quot;Pioneer&quot; hypersonic gliding warhead. This warhead has extremely fast speed and super orbit-changing capabilities, and can effectively protect enemy air defense and anti-missile systems. Almost impossible to intercept. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The third is to hit accurately. &quot;Sarmat&quot; adopts a composite guidance method of inertial guidance, starlight guidance and GLONASS satellite guidance. The three methods combine with each other and complement each other, reducing the missile hit accuracy to about 150 meters, while the SS-18 missile using inertial guidance has a hit accuracy of 350 meters. The improvement of strike accuracy is the improvement of strike power. In this regard, &quot;Sarmat&quot; has done an excellent job and is at the world&#39;s advanced level. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Sarmat&quot; is a liquid-fuel missile. For ballistic missiles, the difference between using solid fuel and liquid fuel lies in specific thrust, toxicity, safety, and ease of control. Liquid fuel has a greater specific thrust than solid fuel. Therefore, the number of segments of a ballistic missile using liquid fuel is one less than that of solid fuel. The refueling takes a long time, so it is not suitable for use as a means of nuclear counterattack - it is more suitable for a &quot;preemptive&quot; nuclear strike, which invisibly increases the deterrence against NATO. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;The future of nuclear weapons&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;As the most destructive force on earth, the development of nuclear weapons will show several trends in the future. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First of all, the means of delivering nuclear warheads will develop towards hypersonic missiles. As modern missile defense systems continue to mature and evolve, how to improve the penetration capabilities of nuclear missiles has become an important issue. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among the current equipment, new concept weapons such as hypersonic missiles are beginning to stand out. Hypersonic technology refers to aircraft technology that can fly at speeds exceeding 5 times the speed of sound. It is the commanding heights of aerospace technology in the 21st century. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The outstanding advantages of hypersonic missiles are mainly reflected in three aspects. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First, it basically flies in the upper atmosphere, with a flight altitude of only 30-80 kilometers, and the terminal altitude may be only more than 20 kilometers, which greatly affects the detection capabilities of the early warning radar of traditional ballistic missile defense systems. . Early warning radars represented by the US &quot;Pave Claw&quot; have a detection range of long-range and intercontinental missiles up to thousands of kilometers, but the detection range of hypersonic weapons flying at an altitude of tens of kilometers is only a few hundred kilometers. Therefore, the ballistic missile defense system&#39;s defense effect against such aircraft is greatly reduced. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The second is that because it flies controlled in the atmosphere, it has good maneuverability compared to the dull trajectory of traditional ballistic missiles. Coupled with the speed of hypersonics, the difficulty of intercepting it has increased significantly, further weakening the interception capabilities of traditional ballistic missile defense systems. In other words, hypersonic gliding vehicles have significantly improved penetration capabilities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hypersonic glide vehicles can also be used in conjunction with traditional ballistic missiles. Although such a combination increases the risk of interception during mid-flight, it greatly increases the actual range of the missile. This technological trend has been very obvious in the &quot;Sarmat&quot; missile. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the future, the deep sea may become an important space for nuclear weapons projection. Due to the special physical characteristics of the deep sea, radar waves cannot penetrate, so military operations are very concealed. The &quot;Poseidon&quot; nuclear torpedo developed by Russia was developed based on this logic. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is said that the maximum speed of &quot;Poseidon&quot; will exceed 200 kilometers per hour (about 110 knots), and the maximum diving depth will exceed 1,000 meters. With such a high speed underwater, it cannot be effectively intercepted. The fastest nuclear submarine currently in service has a maximum speed of 35 knots, and the most advanced torpedoes equipped in Western countries have a maximum speed of 55 knots. This makes existing torpedo weapons &quot;Poseidon&quot; cannot be intercepted. The torpedo can carry a nuclear or conventional warhead with an equivalent of 2 million tons of TNT. When it explodes near the enemy&#39;s coast, it can trigger a huge tsunami, causing devastating blows to ports, cities, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is estimated that it can form a huge tsunami impact with a span of 550 kilometers and a maximum wave height of 500 meters. No ship anchored in the port can survive. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the world&#39;s first atomic bomb successfully exploded at the test site, Oppenheimer once quoted a sentence from the Hindu scripture &quot;Bhagavad Gita&quot;: Now I have become death, the destroyer of worlds. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;With the development of 70 years, the progress of missile technology will force the further improvement of anti-missile technology. New concept weapons such as high-energy lasers and electromagnetic guns will likely be used in missile defense systems. Human war will thus kick off another round of offensive and defensive games. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The dialogue between Oppenheimer and Einstein in the film shows that there is still no answer to the confusion about personal destiny and future. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(The author is the deputy director of the Northeast Asia Research Center of Shanghai University of Political Science and Law)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 19 Sep 2023 15:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[年轻人买金，老年人卖金？广州市民卖1公斤套现44万多元]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256960]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-19 14:30:48&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&quot;I received an order last month, 1 kilogram, and gave him more than 440,000 yuan.&quot; One person Said an industry insider who has been engaged in gold recycling for more than ten years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Recently, the price of gold in the domestic retail market has continued to rise, once exceeding 600 yuan per gram. Topics such as gold prices have been hotly searched. So far, consumers’ enthusiasm has not diminished. Amid the gold buying craze, gold The recycling market is also experiencing a gold selling boom. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the working day of September 18, Nandu reporters visited the gold wholesale business district of Changshou West Road in Liwan District, Guangzhou and the supermarket in Tianhe District, Guangzhou. They saw that many people still went to consult or buy gold. The gold price that day It has dropped from last week, and the gold recycling prices online and offline, and for different brands, are different, with big differences. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, most young people have been buying gold recently, and they are particularly fond of gold beans, which cost around 500 yuan each and weigh 1 gram, as a way to save, which has aroused heated discussion. It is worth noting that after visits, we also found that many middle-aged and elderly people are selling gold. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;“People in their 40s and 50s come to sell”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;At around 1:00 noon on September 18, Changshou West Road, Liwan District, Guangzhou, Signs such as &quot;Recycle Gold and Silver Jewelry&quot; and &quot;Recycle Gold at High Prices&quot; are hung up. At the street intersection, there are many young people hurriedly entering the gold shop, as well as middle-aged and elderly people holding small bags in the store and looking around. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Shenzhen Shuibei is known as the &quot;barometer&quot; of the gold and jewelry market. Hengtai Jewelry, located in the gold wholesale business district of Changshou West Road, is the Guangzhou branch of Shenzhen Shuibei. The reporter found that within half an hour, , the number of consumers in the store has always remained above 20, and most of them sit around the display cabinet to inquire about and buy gold jewelry. One row sells gold jewelry with smaller grams such as Jin Doudou, and the other row sells gold bracelets with larger grams. Waiting, &quot;We are getting married, so we came to buy during the lunch break. Today (September 18) the price is a little lower than before.&quot; A pair of young people are buying gold bracelets. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/19/82a468ff6fffb6646188ca3ce6d49589.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;1383&quot; height=&quot;1086&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/19/82a468ff6fffb6646188ca3ce6d49589.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;251166&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Changshou West Road, Liwan District, Guangzhou. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the gold recycling area in the corner of the store, there is an electronic screen showing the continuously fluctuating price: gold repurchase is 468.98 yuan, and the highest price of the day is 471.72 yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;The price of recycling at the end of last year reached more than 400 yuan.&quot; According to the staff of the store, the price of gold in the whole store that day was 471 yuan, the price of recycled gold bars or gold sheets was 468 yuan, and the price of recycled gold was 468 yuan. Accessories cost 5 yuan less, calculated as 463 yuan, which is 2 yuan lower than at the weekend. At present, most of the gold sheets on the market are mainly one kilogram, and such as gold beans and bracelets are gold jewelry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In about half an hour, two citizens over the age of 50 came to inquire about the gold recycling market. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Recently, gold sellers have to line up outside, and the whole street is filled with gold sellers.” An industry insider who has been engaged in gold recycling for more than ten years also opened a store in the gold wholesale business district. He opened a jewelry store specializing in gold recycling. On that day, he also recycled gold for 463 yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“There are many grams of recycling, and the recycling price can still be negotiated.” This industry insider said that the recycling price has risen to more than 460 yuan in the past half month, and the recycling price reached the highest level of 479 yuan per gram last week, maintaining the same level. In half a day, &quot;I received an order last month with a unit price of more than 440 yuan per kilogram, and I gave him more than 440,000 yuan.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In about half a month, the recycling price increased from more than 440 yuan per gram. to more than 460 yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Recently, prices in the domestic gold retail market have continued to rise, driving the growth of the recycling business. According to an industry insider, he recycled one order that day and has made more than 20 orders in the past ten days. “They are all in the 40s or 50s. There are no young people to sell to people who are 20 years old.&quot; said the above-mentioned industry insider. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;The price difference between the recycling of branded gold jewelry is more than 100 yuan&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Unlike the wholesale market, the recycling market in supermarkets in Tianhe District, Guangzhou is relatively cold. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At around 3 pm, almost every gold brand store in Tianhe City in Tianhe District had people shopping. The listed prices of gold in different brand stores are different, all above 600 yuan per gram, and some are as high as 600 yuan per gram. The gold price is 610 yuan per gram, but there are basically price discounts ranging from 20 to 40 yuan. According to many staff on site, the price of gold has dropped by a few yuan from the peak last week. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for recycling services, only a few brands provide them and the recycling prices are low. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the staff of Tianhe City China Gold Store, the gold price after discount is 568 yuan per gram, and the recycling price is 405 yuan per gram. There are relatively few people coming to sell, &quot;Today (September 18) ) No one recycles it.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The selling price of Jinzhizun gold is 609 yuan per gram, and only the investment gold bars are recycled, which is recycled at 430 yuan that day. Lao Fengxiang and Chow Tai Fook do not have on-site recycling services. Among them, Chow Tai Fook’s gold price is 608 yuan per gram, and the recycling price is 451 yuan. According to a staff member of Chow Tai Fook, this store cannot recycle, and you have to go to the store on Beijing Road. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/19/cf496b79e899c0812c38fc1f670143aa.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;4032&quot; height=&quot;3024&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/19/cf496b79e899c0812c38fc1f670143aa.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;251167&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Guangzhou Tianhe City Chow Tai Fook Store. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to offline platforms, many e-commerce platforms also provide gold recycling services. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The reporter randomly searched for &quot;Guangzhou gold recycling&quot; on Taobao, Tmall and other platforms, selected 4 stores with sales of 1,000+ payments, and inquired from customer service. They all said that the recycling price was 465 yuan per gram, and the price was 465 yuan per gram in the same city. You can come to your door for recycling and pay on the spot; but if the store is in other cities, it needs to be evaluated online. The consumer takes a photo of the store link and mails it to the merchant. After the merchant signs and checks the gram number, the merchant pays the consumer. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It can be seen that the recycling prices of gold jewelry of different brands are different online and offline, and there is a big difference. For the wholesale market, it is generally 8-10 yuan less than the gold price sold; for brand stores in supermarkets , the difference is more than 100 yuan; while the online recycling price is 2 yuan more than that in the offline wholesale market. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Some supermarkets need to pay nearly a thousand yuan for redemption&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;“I just received a customer to redeem.” The reporter said Visiting supermarket brands also found that although many brand stores do not recycle gold and can only exchange old items for new ones, and the method is complicated, many consumers come to consult or exchange for the styles they like. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Trade-in means that the gold products in the hands of consumers are discounted according to the current gold price and then purchased in-store at the current selling price. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/19/086b9e703a353149adb07af4c5f76fde.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;4032&quot; height=&quot;3024&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/19/086b9e703a353149adb07af4c5f76fde.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;251168&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Hengtai Jewelry Store on Changshou West Road in Liwan District, Guangzhou. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the staff of Lao Fengxiang, if you want to exchange for gold that is not of this brand, based on the gold listing price of the brand that day is 608 yuan per gram, the discount per gram you want to exchange is 30 yuan, and the number of grams must also be calculated. 10% off, 30% more grams purchased. In other words, if you have 10 grams of gold to redeem, which is originally 6,080 yuan, you need to calculate the price based on 9 grams of 578 yuan, which is 5,202 yuan, and an additional 3 grams of gold, which is 1,824 yuan, for the total exchange price That’s 7026 yuan. In other words, you need to make a minimum payment of 946 yuan to redeem it, and the crafting fee is additional. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Similarly, China Gold, Chow Tai Fook and other stores have different discounts for redemption. Among them, China Gold staff said that if you want to exchange for gold that is not of the same brand, you will have to pay a price difference of 40 yuan per gram, and there is no labor fee. You can choose the type and quantity of the exchange. According to the staff of Chow Tai Fook, there are two options. If you have 10 grams of gold to redeem, first, you need to exchange for a product heavier than 10 grams, and the discount is calculated at 85 yuan per gram; second, you need to exchange for a product with twice the gram, that is, 20 grams, based on the selling price of the day. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the gold wholesale business district of Changshou West Road, reporters also found that many consumers exchanged for gold products. At noon on September 18, two Guangzhou citizens in their 50s brought 10.06 grams of gold chains to change styles and walked into a gold store. A sign hanging outside the gold store read &quot;Old gold for new, one gram for one gram.&quot; According to reports, the gold chain is charged based on the recycling price of 463 yuan plus 15% handicraft fee. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 19 Sep 2023 14:55:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[安徽十元“盒饭姐”爆火后流泪，围观的边界感在哪？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256956]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-19 14:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 19 Sep 2023 14:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[苹果“芯”，闭环未完成丨科创要闻]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256950]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-19 11:57:16&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/19/EF18nz4G745NrZGbfXK5vE46XmfTmtmdvfpRt0BX.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1423&quot; height=&quot;692&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/19/EF18nz4G745NrZGbfXK5vE46 XmfTmtmdvfpRt0BX. png&quot; data-key=&quot;251156&quot; data-mce-width=&quot;0&quot; data-mce-height=&quot;0&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;&lt;strong>;Communications &amp;amp; Chip&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;h5>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://investor.qualcomm.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1351/qualcomm-announces-agreement-with-apple-for-chip-supply&quot;>;&lt;strong>; Qualcomm and Apple reached a three-year chip supply agreement&lt;/strong>;&lt;/a>;&lt;/h5>; &lt;p>;On September 11, Qualcomm announced that it had reached a new agreement with Apple.
