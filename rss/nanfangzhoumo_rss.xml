A new film about Oppenheimer&#39;s life and his leadership in creating the world&#39;s first atomic bomb during World War II will be released in theaters on July 21, 2023, local time. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among the summer movies, &quot;Oppenheimer&quot; is one of the most eye-catching ones. The protagonist in the film is Julius Robert Oppenheimer, a genius Jewish scientist known as the &quot;Father of the Atomic Bomb&quot;. His &quot;work&quot; directly changed the face of the world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Recently, as the conflict between Russia and Ukraine continues to escalate, at a critical moment when the Ukrainian army launches a large-scale counterattack, Russia demonstrated a powerful weapon-the &quot;Sarmat&quot; land-based intercontinental ballistic missile. This giant intercontinental missile has been put on combat readiness to prepare for possible crises. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From Oppenheimer to &quot;Sarmat&quot;, what has happened in the past 70 years? Let&#39;s review the history of nuclear weapons. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Oppenheimer&#39;s &quot;Legacy&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Oppenheimer, a name closely associated with the atomic bomb and the &quot;Manhattan Project.&quot; This Jewish genius scientist has shown extraordinary talents since he was a child. In his childhood, he was influenced by his mother and dabbled in various fields such as art, literature, philosophy, history, science and language. The youngest member of the Mineral Club, he graduated with first place from Fieldston School of Arts and Sciences in New York at the age of 18 (many political, business and cultural celebrities in the United States came from this school) and was admitted to the Department of Chemistry at Harvard University. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After graduating from college, Oppenheimer first entered the famous Cavendish Laboratory of the University of Cambridge in England. After that, Oppenheimer was taught by the founder of quantum mechanics and the winner of the 1954 Nobel Prize in Physics. Born’s recommendation led him to the famous University of Göttingen. In 1927, Oppenheimer received his PhD for his research in quantum mechanics and decided to return to the United States not long after. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The highlight of his life was presiding over the United States&#39; nuclear weapons project, the &quot;Manhattan Project.&quot; As the commander-in-chief of the &quot;Manhattan Project&quot;, which cost US$2.5 billion and involved more than 500,000 people at its peak, Oppenheimer fully demonstrated his scientific literacy and management skills. In the movie, Oppenheimer called the project a &quot;gamble&quot; - he won the bet, and the United States also won the bet: at 5:30 in the morning on July 16, 1945, the first atomic bomb in human history was dropped on Los Angeles A successful explosion in the Alamos Desert. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For the rest of his life, Oppenheimer suffered from humiliation and trouble because of this project that brought him great fame. The movie &quot;Oppenheimer&quot; vividly reproduces how he was persecuted by politicians represented by McCarthyism and General Strauss. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On February 18, 1967, Oppenheimer died of throat cancer at the age of 63. What legacy did he leave to the world in the half century that followed? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As of early 2020, data from the Stockholm Peace Research Institute shows that the United States, Russia, the United Kingdom, France and other countries possess approximately 13,400 nuclear weapons, of which 3,720 have been deployed with combat troops, and approximately 1,800 of them are on high alert. . These nuclear weapons are specifically carried by a variety of delivery systems, including land- and sea-based long-range ballistic missiles, heavy bombers, fighter-bombers, air- and sea-launched cruise missiles, air defense and missile defense interceptor missiles, torpedoes, and depth charges . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hans Christensen, director of the &quot;Nuclear Information Project&quot; of the Federation of American Scientists, believes that both the United States and Russia possess very large nuclear arsenals, backed by short-range tactical nuclear forces, including intercontinental ballistic missiles, Sea-launched ballistic missiles and aircraft capable of carrying nuclear weapons constitute the &quot;trinity&quot; of long-range strategic nuclear forces. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some other countries have &quot;two-in-one&quot; medium-range nuclear forces and/or long-range nuclear forces (that is, they have any two of the three elements of the &quot;trinity&quot;). Some are transitioning to the &quot;Trinity&quot;, and there are rumors that Israel may already have the &quot;Trinity&quot; nuclear power. In addition, Pakistan and India possess short-range nuclear weapons. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It can be said that after 70 years of development, nuclear weapons have not only changed the form of military struggle, but also had a profound impact on the development of human society and the international strategic pattern. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;The birth of the &quot;King of Nuclear Weapons&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Sarmat&quot; intercontinental ballistic missile was born in a time of crisis. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the disintegration of the Soviet Union, Russia, which inherited its legacy, is not comparable to the Soviet Union in terms of armed force building. Unlike the Soviet Union, Russia is a resource-based country and therefore far inferior to its rival NATO in terms of conventional weapons. Nuclear power has therefore increasingly become the core of Russia&#39;s military power. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Land-based nuclear forces are the foundation and pillar of Russia’s “trinity” nuclear forces. Russia&#39;s nuclear power was inherited from the Soviet Union. The three old intercontinental ballistic missile systems of SS-18 &quot;Satan&quot;, SS-19 &quot;Dagger&quot; and SS-25 &quot;Topol&quot; installed by the Strategic Rocket Force account for half of Russia&#39;s land-based nuclear weapons delivery vehicles. As mentioned above, these three old missile systems will reach the end of their service life. Once decommissioned, it will have a huge impact on the stability of Russia&#39;s strategic nuclear forces. Therefore, Russia decided to develop a new intercontinental ballistic missile to replace the SS-18 that is about to be retired. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2009, the &quot;Sarmat&quot; intercontinental ballistic missile was developed by the Makeev Design Bureau. It conducted ejection tests in December 2017 and March 2018 and achieved success. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In terms of performance, this &quot;national weapon&quot; that Russia has high hopes for is really amazing. &quot;Sarmat&quot; is about 35 meters long, about 3 meters in diameter, has a take-off weight of about 200 tons, a payload of up to 10 tons, and a range of up to 17,000 kilometers. The hit accuracy is about 200 meters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Sarmat&quot; adopts a cold launch scheme. During launch, a gunpowder accumulator is used to eject the missile to a height of 20-30 meters above the launch silo, and then the missile ignites itself and takes off. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Sarmat&quot; can carry up to 10 heavy or 15 light independently targeted separately guided nuclear warheads, or 24 &quot;Vanguard&quot; hypersonic boost glide bombs, which can target different targets Deliver devastating strikes and identify attacks from multiple targets. When carrying 10 submissive warheads, the yield of each warhead reaches 750,000 tons of TNT. The missile warhead adopts a variety of advanced penetration technologies, such as stealth technology and materials, separately guided multiple warheads and decoy bombs, hypersonic boost-glide warheads, and maneuverable and flexible orbit-changing capabilities. Its strike power is equivalent to 1,600 times that of the atomic bomb exploded in Hiroshima. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Sarmat&quot; has three unique skills. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First, hit far. This type of missile has a range of 17,000 kilometers. The ultra-long range allows this missile to be launched from any area in Russia and can effectively hit predetermined targets around the world. It is speculated that the &quot;Sarmat&quot; can fly over the Antarctic, completely bypassing all current U.S. missile defense systems, and strike against the United States. Others speculate that it has partial orbital bombing capabilities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The second is to play skillfully. This cleverness is reflected in the super defense penetration ability. In modern warfare, the penetration capability of surface-to-surface missiles has increasingly become an important indicator for measuring the comprehensive technical level of missiles. This type of missile uses stealth technology and materials in its shape design and coating. The missile&#39;s boost section is short, which makes it more difficult for enemy radars and satellites to detect, track and intercept. The powerful power gives it an ultra-long range, the ability to fly over both poles to carry out attacks, and may even have partial orbital bombing capabilities to avoid anti-missile systems to the greatest extent. The missile can carry more than ten separately guided warheads and use multiple decoy warheads at the same time, which greatly improves the identification difficulty of the anti-missile system and its own penetration probability. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, the &quot;Sarmat&quot; can also carry the &quot;Pioneer&quot; hypersonic gliding warhead. This warhead has extremely fast speed and super orbit-changing capabilities, and can effectively protect enemy air defense and anti-missile systems. Almost impossible to intercept. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The third is to hit accurately. &quot;Sarmat&quot; adopts a composite guidance method of inertial guidance, starlight guidance and GLONASS satellite guidance. The three methods combine with each other and complement each other, reducing the missile hit accuracy to about 150 meters, while the SS-18 missile using inertial guidance has a hit accuracy of 350 meters. The improvement of strike accuracy is the improvement of strike power. In this regard, &quot;Sarmat&quot; has done an excellent job and is at the world&#39;s advanced level. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Sarmat&quot; is a liquid-fuel missile. For ballistic missiles, the difference between using solid fuel and liquid fuel lies in specific thrust, toxicity, safety, and ease of control. Liquid fuel has a greater specific thrust than solid fuel. Therefore, the number of segments of a ballistic missile using liquid fuel is one less than that of solid fuel. The refueling takes a long time, so it is not suitable for use as a means of nuclear counterattack - it is more suitable for a &quot;preemptive&quot; nuclear strike, which invisibly increases the deterrence against NATO. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;The future of nuclear weapons&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;As the most destructive force on earth, the development of nuclear weapons will show several trends in the future. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First of all, the means of delivering nuclear warheads will develop towards hypersonic missiles. As modern missile defense systems continue to mature and evolve, how to improve the penetration capabilities of nuclear missiles has become an important issue. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among the current equipment, new concept weapons such as hypersonic missiles are beginning to stand out. Hypersonic technology refers to aircraft technology that can fly at speeds exceeding 5 times the speed of sound. It is the commanding heights of aerospace technology in the 21st century. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The outstanding advantages of hypersonic missiles are mainly reflected in three aspects. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First, it basically flies in the upper atmosphere, with a flight altitude of only 30-80 kilometers, and the terminal altitude may be only more than 20 kilometers, which greatly affects the detection capabilities of the early warning radar of traditional ballistic missile defense systems. . Early warning radars represented by the US &quot;Pave Claw&quot; have a detection range of long-range and intercontinental missiles up to thousands of kilometers, but the detection range of hypersonic weapons flying at an altitude of tens of kilometers is only a few hundred kilometers. Therefore, the ballistic missile defense system&#39;s defense effect against such aircraft is greatly reduced. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The second is that because it flies controlled in the atmosphere, it has good maneuverability compared to the dull trajectory of traditional ballistic missiles. Coupled with the speed of hypersonics, the difficulty of intercepting it has increased significantly, further weakening the interception capabilities of traditional ballistic missile defense systems. In other words, hypersonic gliding vehicles have significantly improved penetration capabilities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hypersonic glide vehicles can also be used in conjunction with traditional ballistic missiles. Although such a combination increases the risk of interception during mid-flight, it greatly increases the actual range of the missile. This technological trend has been very obvious in the &quot;Sarmat&quot; missile. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the future, the deep sea may become an important space for nuclear weapons projection. Due to the special physical characteristics of the deep sea, radar waves cannot penetrate, so military operations are very concealed. The &quot;Poseidon&quot; nuclear torpedo developed by Russia was developed based on this logic. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is said that the maximum speed of &quot;Poseidon&quot; will exceed 200 kilometers per hour (about 110 knots), and the maximum diving depth will exceed 1,000 meters. With such a high speed underwater, it cannot be effectively intercepted. The fastest nuclear submarine currently in service has a maximum speed of 35 knots, and the most advanced torpedoes equipped in Western countries have a maximum speed of 55 knots. This makes existing torpedo weapons &quot;Poseidon&quot; cannot be intercepted. The torpedo can carry a nuclear or conventional warhead with an equivalent of 2 million tons of TNT. When it explodes near the enemy&#39;s coast, it can trigger a huge tsunami, causing devastating blows to ports, cities, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is estimated that it can form a huge tsunami impact with a span of 550 kilometers and a maximum wave height of 500 meters. No ship anchored in the port can survive. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the world&#39;s first atomic bomb successfully exploded at the test site, Oppenheimer once quoted a sentence from the Hindu scripture &quot;Bhagavad Gita&quot;: Now I have become death, the destroyer of worlds. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;With the development of 70 years, the progress of missile technology will force the further improvement of anti-missile technology. New concept weapons such as high-energy lasers and electromagnetic guns will likely be used in missile defense systems. Human war will thus kick off another round of offensive and defensive games. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The dialogue between Oppenheimer and Einstein in the film shows that there is still no answer to the confusion about personal destiny and future. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(The author is the deputy director of the Northeast Asia Research Center of Shanghai University of Political Science and Law)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 19 Sep 2023 15:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[年轻人买金，老年人卖金？广州市民卖1公斤套现44万多元]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256960]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-19 14:30:48&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&quot;I received an order last month, 1 kilogram, and gave him more than 440,000 yuan.&quot; One person Said an industry insider who has been engaged in gold recycling for more than ten years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Recently, the price of gold in the domestic retail market has continued to rise, once exceeding 600 yuan per gram. Topics such as gold prices have been hotly searched. So far, consumers’ enthusiasm has not diminished. Amid the gold buying craze, gold The recycling market is also experiencing a gold selling boom. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the working day of September 18, Nandu reporters visited the gold wholesale business district of Changshou West Road in Liwan District, Guangzhou and the supermarket in Tianhe District, Guangzhou. They saw that many people still went to consult or buy gold. The gold price that day It has dropped from last week, and the gold recycling prices online and offline, and for different brands, are different, with big differences. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, most young people have been buying gold recently, and they are particularly fond of gold beans, which cost around 500 yuan each and weigh 1 gram, as a way to save, which has aroused heated discussion. It is worth noting that after visits, we also found that many middle-aged and elderly people are selling gold. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;“People in their 40s and 50s come to sell”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;At around 1:00 noon on September 18, Changshou West Road, Liwan District, Guangzhou, Signs such as &quot;Recycle Gold and Silver Jewelry&quot; and &quot;Recycle Gold at High Prices&quot; are hung up. At the street intersection, there are many young people hurriedly entering the gold shop, as well as middle-aged and elderly people holding small bags in the store and looking around. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Shenzhen Shuibei is known as the &quot;barometer&quot; of the gold and jewelry market. Hengtai Jewelry, located in the gold wholesale business district of Changshou West Road, is the Guangzhou branch of Shenzhen Shuibei. The reporter found that within half an hour, , the number of consumers in the store has always remained above 20, and most of them sit around the display cabinet to inquire about and buy gold jewelry. One row sells gold jewelry with smaller grams such as Jin Doudou, and the other row sells gold bracelets with larger grams. Waiting, &quot;We are getting married, so we came to buy during the lunch break. Today (September 18) the price is a little lower than before.&quot; A pair of young people are buying gold bracelets. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/19/82a468ff6fffb6646188ca3ce6d49589.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;1383&quot; height=&quot;1086&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/19/82a468ff6fffb6646188ca3ce6d49589.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;251166&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Changshou West Road, Liwan District, Guangzhou. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the gold recycling area in the corner of the store, there is an electronic screen showing the continuously fluctuating price: gold repurchase is 468.98 yuan, and the highest price of the day is 471.72 yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;The price of recycling at the end of last year reached more than 400 yuan.&quot; According to the staff of the store, the price of gold in the whole store that day was 471 yuan, the price of recycled gold bars or gold sheets was 468 yuan, and the price of recycled gold was 468 yuan. Accessories cost 5 yuan less, calculated as 463 yuan, which is 2 yuan lower than at the weekend. At present, most of the gold sheets on the market are mainly one kilogram, and such as gold beans and bracelets are gold jewelry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In about half an hour, two citizens over the age of 50 came to inquire about the gold recycling market. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Recently, gold sellers have to line up outside, and the whole street is filled with gold sellers.” An industry insider who has been engaged in gold recycling for more than ten years also opened a store in the gold wholesale business district. He opened a jewelry store specializing in gold recycling. On that day, he also recycled gold for 463 yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“There are many grams of recycling, and the recycling price can still be negotiated.” This industry insider said that the recycling price has risen to more than 460 yuan in the past half month, and the recycling price reached the highest level of 479 yuan per gram last week, maintaining the same level. In half a day, &quot;I received an order last month with a unit price of more than 440 yuan per kilogram, and I gave him more than 440,000 yuan.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In about half a month, the recycling price increased from more than 440 yuan per gram. to more than 460 yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Recently, prices in the domestic gold retail market have continued to rise, driving the growth of the recycling business. According to an industry insider, he recycled one order that day and has made more than 20 orders in the past ten days. “They are all in the 40s or 50s. There are no young people to sell to people who are 20 years old.&quot; said the above-mentioned industry insider. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;The price difference between the recycling of branded gold jewelry is more than 100 yuan&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Unlike the wholesale market, the recycling market in supermarkets in Tianhe District, Guangzhou is relatively cold. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At around 3 pm, almost every gold brand store in Tianhe City in Tianhe District had people shopping. The listed prices of gold in different brand stores are different, all above 600 yuan per gram, and some are as high as 600 yuan per gram. The gold price is 610 yuan per gram, but there are basically price discounts ranging from 20 to 40 yuan. According to many staff on site, the price of gold has dropped by a few yuan from the peak last week. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for recycling services, only a few brands provide them and the recycling prices are low. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the staff of Tianhe City China Gold Store, the gold price after discount is 568 yuan per gram, and the recycling price is 405 yuan per gram. There are relatively few people coming to sell, &quot;Today (September 18) ) No one recycles it.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The selling price of Jinzhizun gold is 609 yuan per gram, and only the investment gold bars are recycled, which is recycled at 430 yuan that day. Lao Fengxiang and Chow Tai Fook do not have on-site recycling services. Among them, Chow Tai Fook’s gold price is 608 yuan per gram, and the recycling price is 451 yuan. According to a staff member of Chow Tai Fook, this store cannot recycle, and you have to go to the store on Beijing Road. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/19/cf496b79e899c0812c38fc1f670143aa.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;4032&quot; height=&quot;3024&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/19/cf496b79e899c0812c38fc1f670143aa.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;251167&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Guangzhou Tianhe City Chow Tai Fook Store. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to offline platforms, many e-commerce platforms also provide gold recycling services. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The reporter randomly searched for &quot;Guangzhou gold recycling&quot; on Taobao, Tmall and other platforms, selected 4 stores with sales of 1,000+ payments, and inquired from customer service. They all said that the recycling price was 465 yuan per gram, and the price was 465 yuan per gram in the same city. You can come to your door for recycling and pay on the spot; but if the store is in other cities, it needs to be evaluated online. The consumer takes a photo of the store link and mails it to the merchant. After the merchant signs and checks the gram number, the merchant pays the consumer. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It can be seen that the recycling prices of gold jewelry of different brands are different online and offline, and there is a big difference. For the wholesale market, it is generally 8-10 yuan less than the gold price sold; for brand stores in supermarkets , the difference is more than 100 yuan; while the online recycling price is 2 yuan more than that in the offline wholesale market. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Some supermarkets need to pay nearly a thousand yuan for redemption&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;“I just received a customer to redeem.” The reporter said Visiting supermarket brands also found that although many brand stores do not recycle gold and can only exchange old items for new ones, and the method is complicated, many consumers come to consult or exchange for the styles they like. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Trade-in means that the gold products in the hands of consumers are discounted according to the current gold price and then purchased in-store at the current selling price. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/19/086b9e703a353149adb07af4c5f76fde.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;4032&quot; height=&quot;3024&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/19/086b9e703a353149adb07af4c5f76fde.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;251168&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Hengtai Jewelry Store on Changshou West Road in Liwan District, Guangzhou. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the staff of Lao Fengxiang, if you want to exchange for gold that is not of this brand, based on the gold listing price of the brand that day is 608 yuan per gram, the discount per gram you want to exchange is 30 yuan, and the number of grams must also be calculated. 10% off, 30% more grams purchased. In other words, if you have 10 grams of gold to redeem, which is originally 6,080 yuan, you need to calculate the price based on 9 grams of 578 yuan, which is 5,202 yuan, and an additional 3 grams of gold, which is 1,824 yuan, for the total exchange price That’s 7026 yuan. In other words, you need to make a minimum payment of 946 yuan to redeem it, and the crafting fee is additional. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Similarly, China Gold, Chow Tai Fook and other stores have different discounts for redemption. Among them, China Gold staff said that if you want to exchange for gold that is not of the same brand, you will have to pay a price difference of 40 yuan per gram, and there is no labor fee. You can choose the type and quantity of the exchange. According to the staff of Chow Tai Fook, there are two options.

In 2010, Apple introduced Qualcomm&#39;s 3G/4G baseband products for the first time on the iPhone 4. Since 2011, Qualcomm has become the exclusive supplier of iPhone basebands and takes 5% of the sales price as a patent licensing fee. Around 2018, disputes broke out between the two parties during contract renewal negotiations for 5G baseband chips, and they initiated patent lawsuits against each other. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold; &quot;>;At the same time, Apple is also trying to create a closed loop of self-developed chips.

In March 2021, it invested in the construction of a new European semiconductor laboratory in Munich, with the first phase of investment. 1 billion euros. According to the six-year licensing agreement reached between Apple and Qualcomm in 2019, Apple will stop purchasing 5G baseband chips from Qualcomm after 2024. However, judging from this supply agreement, although Apple’s 3nm process chips are currently leading the commercial market, self-developed baseband chips are still on the way, and Qualcomm cannot be untied yet.

The court found that: From 1993 to 1996, Yu Huaying, together with Gong Mouliang (deceased), traveled around Guizhou Province, Chongqing City and other places to find suitable children for abduction and trafficking. After they succeeded, the two took the abducted children to A total of 11 children were abducted and trafficked in Handan City, Hebei Province. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yu Huaying expressed her right to appeal in court, which also showed that she was neither satisfied with the verdict nor wanted to die. However, thinking about the 11 children who were deceived, kidnapped and trafficked by her, which parent would not hate her to the core? &amp;nbsp;When a child disappears, parents become furious, shed tears, and look for it locally or across the country. Normal life and work are disrupted, joy is lost, and families are broken up. In this process, some parents fall into self-blame and are unable to extricate themselves. Their lives have lost meaning, or they have given up on themselves, or died in depression. Some parents have given up hope at a certain point, but the wounds in their hearts that will never heal will often feel dull pain or even... In acute attacks, there are also parents who are unwilling to give up and will not stop. However, given the size of China, it is extremely difficult to find their children. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the court hearing, there were family members of the victims and even those who were trafficked and are now adults but will always be &quot;children&quot; in the eyes of their parents. Yang Niuhua was one of them. In the process of bringing Yu Huaying to justice and giving him the punishment he deserved, Yang Niuhua played an irreplaceable role. It was her persistence and perseverance that allowed Yu Huaying to be finally arrested, and we were able to see what happened on September 18 That scene. In a word, Yang Niuhua is a well-deserved and admirable hero. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1990, Yang Niuhua was born in Zhijin County, Guizhou. She is the youngest daughter in the family. She has a happy family and many unforgettable childhood memories. It is these indelible memories that have become her heart The eternal light helped her find her way home. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yu Huaying and her gang lived near Yang Niuhua&#39;s house. She was &quot;very good to herself and her sister. She would take them shopping and buy things.&quot; One day, when there were no adults at home, Yu Huaying defrauded and abducted 5-year-old Yang Niuhua for 2,500 yuan. Yang Niuhua will never forget: After being tricked into boarding the train, Yu Huaying immediately changed into a fierce face, not only punched and kicked her, but also poured boiling water from the thermos directly onto her head, in order to &quot;reduce management&quot; Cost” obedience training. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2012, Yang Niuhua began a long journey to find her relatives. In April 2021, she posted information about searching for relatives on a short video platform, recalling every moment of getting along with her family: she fell into a puddle and almost drowned, and her sister cried beside her when she climbed up; she fell from a pig pen and suffered a bloody head. Flow, my sister went to find her mother crying behind her back. On May 3 of the same year, Yang Niuhua’s video aroused the concern of a girl named Yang in Zhijin County, Guizhou. She had heard from her elders since she was a child that a cousin was lost in 1995. After DNA comparison and confirmation, Yang Niuhua, who had been abducted for 26 years, finally embarked on her way home. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Unfortunately, after she was abducted, her father passed away in 1997 due to excessive drinking due to sadness, and her mother also passed away the next year due to being unable to bear the mental shock, leaving her sister as an orphan. Later, her sister told her that at night, her parents would take her to the train station to find someone, and they would lay bunks on the station floor at night. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In an interview with the media, Yang Niuhua said: &quot;When I didn&#39;t find a home before, I never thought about looking for human traffickers. It was only after I found my home that there were so many changes in my home that I made up my mind. We are looking for human traffickers.&quot; In June 2022, Yang Niuhua provided clues to the Guizhou police. 24 days later, Yu Huaying was captured by the Nanming Branch of the Guiyang Municipal Public Security Bureau. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Later, the Nanming District Procuratorate of Guiyang City prosecuted Yu Huaying for the crime of &quot;child abduction and trafficking.&quot; According to Wang Wenguang, Yang Niuhua’s attorney, the prosecutor initially recommended a 14-year prison sentence. Yang Niuhua was not satisfied with this sentencing recommendation. She entrusted a lawyer to apply to transfer the case from the Nanming District Court of Guiyang City to the Intermediate Court of Guiyang City for trial. We have all seen the following parts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The 11 child trafficking cases that Yu Huaying was accused of this time did not include the cases that had been tried and closed before, nor did they include her own son that she sold. It was the proceeds from this time that made her Tasted the sweetness and blood, I couldn&#39;t stop it from now on. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to Southern Weekend, during the trial, Yu Huaying apologized twice to the abducted family, hoping to gain their understanding and hope that the court would give him a lighter punishment. But Yang Niuhua found it difficult to accept Yu Huaying&#39;s apology. Such intolerance shows justice and bloodshed! There is a classic dialogue in &quot;The Analects of Confucius&quot;, which may be said: How about repaying evil with kindness? Confucius said: How to repay virtue? Repay vengeance with straightness and repay kindness with kindness. When a person suffers great harm, is deprived of rights, insulted, and loses his original life, he certainly has the right to demand the justice he deserves from the perpetrator. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The victim has the right to demand justice, and whether he or she can finally get justice are, of course, two different things. The former cannot automatically lead to the latter, but requires the victim himself to &quot;do merit.&quot; Yang Niuhua did not let go of the human traffickers. Her direct motive was to seek justice for herself and her parents. At the same time, she also sought justice for all the abducted children and their families, and also for us. This society has established a sense of integrity and integrity. Be subjective for yourself, objectively benefit others. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Go further, punish evil and promote good. If you don’t punish evil, how can you promote good? It is the greatest mockery of good and justice for the bad guys to end up good. Only when there is more and more righteousness and bloodiness in this society, those with evil intentions will have scruples and think twice before doing evil things, and we will be able to enjoy greater freedom and security. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 19 Sep 2023 13:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[赛百味700亿卖身：降不住中国胃的轻食还会越吃越肥？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256932]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-19 12:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/18/c01164b14aab8acb3eb16ac74acd8b48.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;721&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/18/c01164b14aab8acb3eb16ac74acd8b48. jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;251105&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;（IC photo&amp;nbsp;/图）&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Recently, the world-famous Fast food chain Subway has successfully &quot;sold itself out&quot;.

It has been famous for providing freshly customized sandwiches, wraps, salads, etc. It is widely popular in weight loss and fitness circles. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, as competition in the catering industry intensifies, under the name of health, waves of ketogenic diets, meal replacements, and sugar replacements come one after another, and various &quot;fat-reducing diets&quot; &quot;Meals&quot; are emerging one after another. Gradually, Subway&#39;s sandwiches have lost their originality and are no longer fashionable in the eyes of Chinese foodies who pursue healthy consumption. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;An endless stream of weight loss meals&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In order to successfully lose weight, people take great pains in their diet, and this can always be captured by keen merchants, so over the years, diets in the name of weight loss have Wave after wave. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Meal replacement is quite popular nowadays. Meal replacement, as the name suggests, can replace part or all of the main meals. It is a type of food that quickly, conveniently and quantitatively provides the human body with appropriate amounts of protein, fat, carbohydrates, fiber and other necessary nutrients. There are meal replacement powders and meal replacement milks. Shakes, meal replacement porridge, meal replacement snacks, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Meal replacement was initially targeted at patients with specific diseases, astronauts, mountaineers and other people. Later, it quickly became popular among weight loss people, and the market scale expanded rapidly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to Tmall statistics, sales of meal replacement light food products in 2021 increased by 290% year-on-year. The number of meal replacement consumers increased by 78% in three years, and the per capita annual consumption amount has exceeded 3,000 yuan. . Statistics from global market research company Euromonitor International show that in 2017, China&#39;s meal replacement market size was approximately 57.17 billion yuan, and is expected to reach 120 billion yuan in 2022. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Substitute sugar is similar to meal replacement. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sugar substitutes have a sweetness similar to sucrose, but do not produce calories or have very low calories. This is most common in beverages and snacks, which are all labeled with &quot;zero sugar&quot; and &quot;zero calories&quot; to tell consumers that they can satisfy their cravings without gaining weight. For example, drinks represented by Yuanqi Forest under the banner of &quot;zero sugar&quot; adjust the taste by adding sugar substitutes &quot;erythritol&quot; and &quot;sucralose&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the stereotype of some dieters, sugar and carbohydrates are the main culprits of obesity, so in addition to avoiding sugar, some people also do everything possible to reduce or even eliminate carbohydrates. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The ketogenic diet, which rejects all carbohydrates, has become popular. The traditional Chinese eating habits are too high in carbohydrates, and the ketogenic diet goes to the other extreme: only eating lean meats and vegetables, and not eating staple foods containing carbohydrates, thereby producing a large amount of ketone bodies and forcing the body to burn fat. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The next step is the fat-reducing meal. Simply put, it is a meal that can reduce fat. It is generally less oil, less salt, and low in calories. Unlike the ketogenic diet, its nutrition is relatively balanced. Most diets for weight loss are not delicious. Fat-reduction meals now stand out on social platforms because they can be &quot;delicious&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, some people found hope in the burgers and fried chicken of the carbohydrate giant. On the one hand, burgers and chicken legs can not only provide excellent protein and necessary fat for the human body, but on the other hand, their calories are not as high as imagined. For example, some burgers only have 450 calories. The daily caloric intake of adult women in my country is about 1,800 kilocalories, and that of adult men is 2,250 kilocalories, so eating a hamburger for one meal is not a big problem. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Compared with other weight-loss meals, fat-reducing meals are becoming a major source of traffic on social platforms. Other weight-loss meals can basically only be bought from merchants, which are unpalatable and expensive. However, fat-loss meals are suitable for DIY. There are a wide variety of menus to share on social platforms, and all kinds of food are available. They are delicious and can help you lose weight, so why not for? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/18/af1c4b7c289a7bcdee642927260594ac.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;810&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/18/af1c4b7c289a7bcdee642927260594ac.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;251104&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;（IC photo &amp;nbsp;/图）&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;It may not work&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;But, can Internet celebrity weight loss meals really help you lose weight? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, many Internet celebrity weight loss meals are specious and just seek psychological comfort. For example, the various meal replacement snacks that have become popular in the past two years, such as oatmeal brittle, compressed biscuits, cereal yogurt, and instant corn flakes, are not low in sugar. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although some sugar substitute biscuits replace sucrose with sugar substitute and wheat flour with coarse grain flour rich in dietary fiber, the main ingredient is still starch. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another example is the popular salad set on the takeout platform, which is piled with vegetables, fruits and some meat, and looks very healthy. In fact, although fruits supplement vitamins, their sugar content is not low; avocados are not low in fat; a few grains of purple/brown rice just look like whole grains and are probably refined carbohydrates; more importantly, there are various sauces that enhance the taste. Ingredients, the calories are very likely to explode...&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Salad sets on takeout platforms often do not provide accurate energy tables, but merchants with little nutrition knowledge prepare them at will, and consumers spend more money. Just buy a psychological comfort. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Even if it may not work, Internet celebrity weight loss meals may also bring health risks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, although meal replacement is a way to supplement nutrients and reduce energy intake, the nutrients in meal replacement cannot replace a balanced diet, and studies have shown that long-term consumption of meal replacement shakes , will affect intestinal peristalsis, reduce metabolism, and in severe cases may cause endocrine disorders in the body. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The same goes for sugar substitute products. After eating sugar, the human body will automatically undergo a glucose metabolism reaction. If you eat sugar substitutes but do not take in the required calories, the normal glucose metabolism reaction will be weakened, resulting in a subsequent decrease in glucose tolerance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The ketogenic diet carries greater risks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the standards of the &quot;Dietary Guidelines for Chinese Residents&quot;, 55%-65% of adults&#39; daily energy intake should come from carbohydrates. A ketogenic diet that refuses carbohydrates will cause insufficient energy for the body, leading to side effects such as fatigue, gastrointestinal dysfunction, and irregular heartbeat. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A study in &quot;The Lancet&quot; showed that there is a U-shaped relationship between carbohydrate intake and life expectancy. A low-carbohydrate diet will reduce life expectancy by up to 4 years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The biggest bug with various fat-reducing meals is that we can eat them for a month to achieve the goal of reducing fat, but can we eat them for a lifetime? Once it fails, the next problem will be: rebound. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A senior nutritionist pointed out: &quot;A single food weight loss method actually deviates from a healthy dietary pattern. The result is that the more you reduce your basal metabolism, the lower your basal metabolism will be, and the rebound will be more severe.&quot; Long-term deficit habit The body will fully absorb them when exposed to carbohydrates and fats to help the body return to normal operating levels, and the weight will rebound quickly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Isn&#39;t this just &quot;losing your wife and losing your troops&quot;? The operation was as fierce as a tiger, but in the end it returned to the same way. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/18/3710cf01919af6f3692376196c081165.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;719&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/18/3710cf01919af6f3692376196c081165.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;251108&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;（IC photo &amp;nbsp;/图）&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Shut up and open your legs&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;What is the truly effective way to lose weight? ? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, it is the clichéd six words, &quot;Shut up and open your legs.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Keeping your mouth shut does not mean not to eat, but it means to control your diet appropriately and ensure a balanced diet. The &quot;Reference Intake of Dietary Nutrients for Chinese Residents&quot; clearly states: The recommended dietary energy supply ratio for adults is 50%-65% carbohydrates, 20%-30% fat, and 10%-15% protein. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Humans are not machines. Only by consuming sufficient and balanced nutrients can normal metabolism be maintained. Of course, overeating is not advisable, but if you diet blindly, once the intake cannot cover the basal metabolism, it will have a negative effect on the body, causing muscle and bone loss. Therefore, any kind of weight loss meal must be based on health. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A person’s fatness or thinness is not only related to the total daily caloric intake, but also related to the total daily caloric consumption. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If there is a calorie surplus, the body will gain weight. If calorie consumption is greater than calorie intake, then the body will lose weight. To successfully lose weight, your total energy intake should be less than your total energy expenditure. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many internet celebrity weight loss meals focus on reducing intake, but their low energy intake has fallen below the bottom line of health. The healthy fat loss formula is: caloric consumption >; caloric intake >; calories required for basal metabolism. The body&#39;s caloric deficit is between 10% and 15% of total consumption. The best way to burn calories is to spread your legs and move. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So it’s better to just “keep your mouth shut and open your legs” if you follow all kinds of celebrity weight-loss meals on the Internet and the prices are quite low. Maintaining a normal and balanced diet while ensuring a certain amount of exercise may not make you lose weight immediately, but it will give you a well-proportioned figure and a healthy body. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 19 Sep 2023 12:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[如何评价历史人物？从“被泼脏水”的隋炀帝说起]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256914]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-19 10:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Over the years, there are probably very few &quot;tyrants&quot; in history who have not been demonstrated by researchers or history buffs He is &quot;actually a talented and strategic monarch&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Indeed, the images of many &quot;tyrants&quot; left in history books, especially their images in traditional literature, are often far from their historical prototypes. After a change of dynasty, if the new dynasty wants to prove its legitimacy, the history books will throw dirty water on it. The identity of the &quot;tyrant&quot; has been recognized, and folk literature and art like to use him to tell erotic and violent stories - after all, deep in human nature, there is such a hobby, but it is not appropriate to place this hobby on a good person, so the &quot;tyrant&quot; &quot;It&#39;s always good to make it very pornographic and violent. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The fate of popular emperors in literary and artistic works such as Shang Zhou and Sui Yang Emperor is probably always like this. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But the question is, peel off the outer layer of skin, what is the inner layer exposed? Let’s take Emperor Yang of Sui Dynasty as an example. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When Emperor Yang of the Sui Dynasty first came to the throne, he inherited a powerful empire that had not been seen for hundreds of years after the fall of the Han Dynasty, and it was also a huge powder keg. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First of all, long-term divisions have been unified in a very short period of time, and some people are dissatisfied with the current regime. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Secondly, his father, Emperor Wen of the Sui Dynasty, had some important institutional reforms and policy practices, which were very beneficial from the national level, but felt uncomfortable at the social level. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, the household registration management in the Sui Dynasty was particularly good. According to official population statistics, the population has increased from 29 million to 46 million in less than 30 years. These 17 million people are definitely not just the result of everyone trying their best to have children when the world is at peace, but the population that was originally hidden has all been plundered. From the perspective of the imperial court, the country had extremely abundant manpower and material resources at its disposal. However, if you look at the perspective of ordinary people at that time, these people did not have to pay taxes or serve in the military. Now all these burdens have been placed on them, and they are not necessarily happy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If these people are all in disarray, there is nothing they can do even if they are dissatisfied. But Emperor Wen of the Sui Dynasty also made another major reform, which was to change the three-level local administration of state-prefecture-county to the second-level state-county administration, and abolish the county level. As a result, tens of thousands of people, from county chiefs to ordinary officials, were about to be laid off. From a national level, this is reducing staff and increasing efficiency. But with so many officials losing their vested interests, they will definitely be furious. If the Sui Dynasty returned all the savings to the people, then the people should be very happy to see these people lose their official positions. But the problem is that the Sui Dynasty concentrated all the profits in the court, and the people of the Sui Dynasty did not get any benefits from this reform that could have benefited them. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The above two reforms, together with other new policies, resulted in a great increase in the income of the Sui Dynasty and a decrease in expenditure. Therefore, many scholars have noticed that when it comes to ancient dynasties, it is said that In terms of &quot;national wealth&quot;, it is unmatched by the Sui Dynasty. But at the same time, this also means that as long as someone wants to rebel, there will immediately be tens of thousands of unemployed officials with administrative organizational skills, and tens of millions of dissatisfied people who can take advantage of them. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But Emperor Yang of the Sui Dynasty was completely unaware of the existence of this problem. He was from a good background, had a smooth life since childhood, and was really smart. He had no ability to empathize with the pain of ordinary people. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He only saw that there were so many resources in the court now, so he wanted to do big things, so he dug the Grand Canal and conquered Liaodong three times, which were all extreme tests of social endurance. It was not that Emperor Yang of the Sui Dynasty did not feel that his throne was threatened, but it was not from this huge powder keg, but from the Guanlong Group that the Sui Dynasty relied on for its success. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before becoming emperor, Emperor Sui Yang was particularly successful in commanding the war in the south. His ability to win over the southern nobles far exceeded that of the older generation of famous generals and ministers of the Guanlong Group. This gave him the illusion that I have new forces available, and you are nothing special. This intensified the division of the ruling group. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this way, the excluded Guanlong dignitaries at the top, the laid-off officials at the middle level, and the ordinary people at the grassroots level who are overwhelmed by heavy labor and taxes will have full anger from top to bottom. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Emperor Sui Yang was indeed not the nymphomaniac or sadist in literary works, but when faced with the challenge, he seemed completely unqualified as a politician. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;You are too willful when things are going well. I don’t want you to think so. I want you to think that you can’t do things and never give up even if you hit a wall. But when it comes to adversity, they lack resilience and willpower, and their willpower collapses immediately. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The world was in chaos. When Emperor Sui Yang arrived in Jiangdu, he actually no longer expected to recapture the north. But his troops were all from the north, and they were afraid of not going back, so they were discussing rebellion. A palace maid heard the news and told Queen Xiao. Empress Xiao is still very smart, so you can speak for yourself. As soon as the result was mentioned, Emperor Sui Yang became furious. Are you qualified to say this? Just kill this palace maid. Later, there were more and more news that the army was going to rebel. Queen Xiao told the people in the palace that there was no need to talk to His Majesty. Why add to his worries? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, in terms of the combat effectiveness of Emperor Sui Yang&#39;s army at that time, it was still very powerful, but at the last moment of his life, Emperor Sui Yang had given up treatment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The summary is that as a political figure, Emperor Sui Yang:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First, he was unable to reconcile complex political and social contradictions;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Second, Failed to build a core team that was loyal to itself and capable;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Third, there was no awareness of changing course when the situation started to go unfavorable;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fourth, there was no persistence when the situation was very unfavorable. will. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for the things he did, such as building the Grand Canal, you might as well look at it this way: When discussing long-term history, even if a person is an emperor, his influence may not be that important. The study of factors such as finance and taxation, technology diffusion, productivity, economic and social structure is enough to explain the problem, and it might as well not involve character evaluation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To evaluate a character, you need to look at the history of a short period of time. A short period of time in the historical sense is a lifetime for ordinary people. The great social collapse of the late Sui Dynasty triggered by Emperor Yang of the Sui Dynasty caused the death and displacement of tens of millions of people. This is real. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Therefore, traditional history books and literary works often apply too much paint to characters. This problem does exist. But if you think the truth is revealed by turning traditional records over, you might as well save it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 19 Sep 2023 10:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[人贩余华英获死刑，受害家庭：“几十年的辛酸，终于清楚了”]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256948]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-19 10:16:43&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/ image/23/09/19/f6b4e7615e.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/ 19/f6b4e7615e.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;251151&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On September 18, 2023, Yu Huaying was charged with child trafficking. Sentenced to death. (Guiyang Intermediate People&#39;s Court/Photo)&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On September 18, 2023, the Guiyang Intermediate People&#39;s Court publicly pronounced the verdict on the crime of child abduction and trafficking against the defendant Yu Huaying. Yu Huaying was sentenced to death for child abduction, deprived of political rights for life, and confiscated all personal property. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In the video shot by the media, Yang Niuhua read the verdict to the parents looking for relatives at the door of the court, hoping that they could all see hope. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Yang Niuhua was abducted and trafficked by Yu Huaying when she was 5 years old. She successfully found her relatives 25 years later. In 2022, Yang Niuhua reported the case to the police and provided clues, and the child abduction and trafficking case of Yu Huaying was officially filed. (For details, please see the relevant report &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.infzm.com/contents/253854?source=134&quot;>;Human trafficker Yu Huaying was sentenced to death: abducted 11 children and also sold her own son&lt;/a a>;》)&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The trial by Guiyang Intermediate People’s Court found that the defendant Yu Huaying collaborated with Gong Mouliang (deceased) from 1993 to 1996 for profit Illegal interests circulated in Guizhou Province, Chongqing City and other places, looking for suitable children to abduct and traffic. After they succeeded, the two took the abducted children to Handan City, Hebei Province, and through the introduction of Wang Moufu and Yang Moulan, they found a buyer for the sale. , profiting from this, during which a total of 11 children were abducted. The Guiyang Intermediate Court held that the defendant Yu Huaying had repeatedly abducted and trafficked children in order to obtain illegal profits. His behavior constituted the crime of child abduction. The crime was particularly serious and extremely harmful to society and should be severely punished. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Yu Huaying appealed in court. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“I hope she will die, but I don’t want her to die”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Although it was only a first-instance verdict, Cai Huiying, a family member of the victim who attended the sentencing, Feeling devastated, she told her relatives on the phone: &quot;We have finally figured it out after decades of hardship and fatigue. We finally understand.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left; &quot;>;After Cai Huiying walked out of the court, she started calling her family. The first one is the abducted party - his younger brother Cai Zhansheng. Cai Shengsheng was 6 years old when he was abducted in Zunyi and disappeared with his brother. A few months later, the elder brother came back alone without seeing his younger brother. It was not until the end of 2022, after the Yu Huaying case was filed, that Cai Shengsheng went home through DNA comparison. Thirty years later, Cai Zhansheng can no longer remember many details, but he still remembers Yu Huaying with high cheekbones and a long face. Cai Huiying said that her brother was also very happy to learn that Yu Huaying was sentenced to death. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Cai Huiying called her parents for the second time. After his younger brother was lost, his father insisted on going out to look for his relatives for more than 20 years, traveling to Yunnan, Sichuan, Guangxi, Guangdong, Fujian, Henan, Jiangxi and other places. Wherever there was news, my father immediately went out to verify it. He went out with hope again and again, but his hope was shattered again and again. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Logically speaking, my father should hate Yu Huaying very much. But two months ago, when my father learned that the prosecutor recommended the death penalty for Yu Huaying in the first trial, &quot;the first sentence he said was that I hope she (Yu Huaying) dies, but I don&#39;t want her to die.&quot; Cai&#39;s father hopes that Yu Huaying will be sentenced to death because she has brought endless harm and pain to his family; he does not want her to die, but he wants to give her some time to tell the story of the children who have been abducted and trafficked over the years, so that more parents can Find the child. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Cai Huiying replied to her father: &quot;This is our common idea, but can she do it?&quot; Cai Huiying once attended the first trial. At that time, Yu Hua Ying expressed that he was &quot;unclear&quot; and &quot;cannot remember&quot; many of the circumstances of the crime. Only when talking about his son and daughter, Yu Huaying burst into tears and choked with sobs. This made Cai Huiying quite angry, and she clenched her fists from time to time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Yu Huaying abducted 11 children, involving 8 families. This time the court pronounced its verdict, and relatives from five families came to listen. One mother had two sons abducted, another mother had a son and a daughter abducted, and yet another mother had a son abducted. When Cai Huiying saw the mother who came from Zunyi, after Yu Huaying was sentenced to death, she stood up with excitement and seemed to want to beat her. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;During lunch, Cai Huiying chatted with several mothers about their respective situations: the children of five families were recovered one after another after Yang Niuhua reported the crime. However, the relationship between the biological family and the foster family is quite complex. Some abducted children find it difficult to cope with the situation, fail to accept family recognition, and rarely come back for reunions. &quot;But we are all grateful to Niuhua, because she reported the crime and we were able to find our relatives.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The regret of broken family ties has appeared in many victim families. In Dazu, Chongqing, Bai Ticai, whose son was abducted by Yu Huaying, was completely unaware of the court verdict. He told Southern Weekend reporters that the child had never seen him since the spring of 2020 when he recognized his relatives, and the two had lost contact. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/19/7486ba21cd.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1706&quot; height=&quot;1280&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/19/7486ba21cd.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;251152&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On September 18, 2023, parents looking for relatives gathered outside the gate of Guiyang Intermediate Hospital.

Everyone held a family-searching information board in front of their chests, on which the information about the abducted children was printed in the most conspicuous yellow letters on a red background. The children were still young when they were abducted, and the printed photos show them when they were one or two years old, and most of them are blurry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;During the court hearing in July, Southern Weekend reporters saw An Shiming, who came to search for his son. He came to the court door early holding a family search information board to broadcast live. This time when the verdict was announced, he once again came early with some parents looking for relatives. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;When Cai Huiying arrived before 8 o&#39;clock, more parents saw this search than at the first trial. She stood far away and did not dare to walk into the crowd. &quot;I felt that as soon as I stood there and heard what they said, I naturally couldn&#39;t control the emotion.&quot; For parents who are still looking for relatives, Cai Huiying feels that what she can say is feeble: &quot;Have more courage and continue.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Yang Niuhua Dare to speak to parents looking for relatives. In a live media broadcast after the trial, she once again encouraged parents looking for their children not to give up. She mentioned her own example: the first time she took blood to find her relatives was in 2012, but there has been no news in the past ten years. But in 2021, in just over a month, she miraculously found her home through the short video platform. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;After finding a home, Yang Niuhua lived in Hebei, Yu Huaying was in Chongqing, and the trafficking case occurred in Guizhou. The three places were far apart. It seemed that it was very difficult to find human traffickers. Disaster. But now, Yu Huaying has been punished by law. &quot;Really never give up,&quot; Yang Niuhua said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Before and after every court session, Yang Niuhua’s schedule is tight and busy. On the one hand, families looking for relatives hope to take this opportunity to spread the information about finding relatives, and find her to live broadcast and record videos together; on the other hand, media interviews continue, and Yang Niuhua repeatedly recounts her experience of being abducted and the hardships of growing up. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Sister Sang Ying felt a little distressed when she saw Yang Niuhua always rushing ahead. Both sisters were actually victims. After Yang Niuhua was abducted in 1995, her parents were extremely sad and died in 1997 and 1998 respectively. Sangying lost her home and was forced to go out to work. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 19 Sep 2023 10:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[电诈受害者的银行卡困境:报案后要被冻结多久]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256940]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-19 09:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/18/2ea2e16682.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;2048&quot; height=&quot;1365&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/18/2ea2e16682. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251128&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On September 10, 2023, the Beijing police were promoting anti-email fraud. Pictures and texts are irrelevant. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Within a week of being defrauded of more than 30,000 yuan, Shenzhen citizen Li Zheng kept asking the police, The bank proved that she was sober and would no longer transfer money to the scammer. On the day she was defrauded, all the debit cards and credit cards in her name were taken protective stop-payment measures by the police and could not be used. The reason was to prevent her from being defrauded again. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The so-called protective stop payment means that in order to protect the victim from further losses, the payment function of the bank card is stopped. Only transfers can be made, but transfers and cash withdrawals cannot be made. The customer service of Li Zheng&#39;s bank card bank informed him that the one-month payment stop measure for bank accounts that are likely to be defrauded again is consistent across the country. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The protective stop payment suddenly made Li Zheng unable to use her bank card to buy groceries, take a car, or even pay school fees for her children. She felt extremely inconvenienced. She found that she was not the only one trying to lift the protective stop payment. There were victims across the country who encountered the same problem. Many of them were still burdened with mortgages and were so anxious that they didn&#39;t know what to do. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The card was frozen after taking the initiative to report the crime&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;On September 7, 2023, Li Zheng was on the noisy street when she received a fraud call. The other party asked her to confirm that her social account was in the security center. The &quot;million protection insurance&quot; is not free. Li Zheng hurried to do things and didn&#39;t want to pay attention to it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The person on the other end of the phone said it would only take a few minutes, just follow the instructions to confirm. Li Zheng listened to the other party&#39;s voice on the road, and responded intermittently. He downloaded a &quot;bank APP&quot; according to the other party&#39;s request, entered different business numbers and order numbers back and forth, and tried to see whether the transfer was successful, starting from 7 yuan to 8 yuan. Small transfers ranging from RMB 20,000 to large transfers of more than 20,000 yuan. After turning the corner and walking into a secluded place, she suddenly realized that she had been cheated. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Zheng immediately hung up on the scammer and dialed 110 to call the police. At this time, she had transferred more than 30,000 yuan to the scammer, and she didn&#39;t know whether she could get it back. The Futian Police Station of the Futian Branch of the Shenzhen Municipal Public Security Bureau quickly received the call and called her to wait where she was for the time being. A police car would be sent to pick her up. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Police from the police station took her for questioning and taking notes. Li Zheng said that at that time, the police only froze the suspect&#39;s account and did not mention that they would implement a protective stop payment on his bank card. The police also uploaded the report details to the national anti-fraud APP, and you can also see relevant information when you log in later. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At 9 o&#39;clock that night, police officers from the Nanshan Branch Merchants Police Station where Li Zheng lived came to her door, asked her if she had been defrauded, and spread anti-fraud knowledge to her. Li Zheng thought that the handling of the fraud case had come to an end. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But when she was about to pay with her mobile phone the next day, she discovered that the two debit cards and one credit card in her name could no longer be used. After consulting the account bank, she learned that it was a protective stop payment operated by the anti-fraud police and was frozen for one month according to regulations. If she wanted to lift it, she could consult the Nanshan Branch Anti-Fraud Center. However, Li Zheng found that the call was not easy to get through, so he complained through the national anti-fraud hotline 96110. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After that, Li Zheng received police calls from Futian Police Station, Shenzhen Public Security Bureau, and Futian Branch. The answers they received were all &quot;In order to protect you from being deceived again, your bank card needs to be frozen for one month.&quot; Li Zheng did not agree with this. She took the initiative to report the crime when she realized that she had been deceived, and she also suffered property losses. &quot;How could it be possible to transfer money to the scammer again?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She believed that the stop-payment measure had caused her many problems. It is inconvenient that bank cards are needed for food and clothing at home and for company transactions. Now everything is &quot;immobilized&quot;. However, the credit card still needs to be repaid and may face the risk of overdue payment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On September 11, at Li Zheng’s strong request, the police accompanied her to withdraw more than 7,000 yuan from two cards. Despite this, she believes that it is still difficult to maintain daily life because the debit card cannot be transferred and the credit card cannot be used. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On September 12, a reporter from Southern Weekend called the Anti-Fraud Center of the Nanshan Branch to inquire. The staff of the Anti-Fraud Center stated that the bank card under Li Zheng’s name was indeed in a “protective stop payment” status and would stop payment within 48 hours. The payment will continue to circulate until one month. How to cancel it can be consulted with the Nanshan Branch. But before that, Li Zheng had communicated with the Nanshan Branch Investment Police Station many times, but the payment stop could not be lifted. Futian branch police told Southern Weekend reporters that what Li Zheng encountered was an ordinary telecommunications fraud case. The matter of lifting the protective stop payment has been communicated and coordinated with the Nanshan branch. More details of the case cannot be disclosed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When Li Zheng rushed between two police stations, she discovered that the situation she encountered was not an isolated case. There were many victims of electronic fraud at the scene who came to complain about frozen bank cards. On the Internet, there are also victims on various social media asking how to lift the protective stop payment. Their ID addresses include Jiangsu, Hubei, Zhejiang, Fujian, Anhui, etc.: &quot;The stop payment on the 21st of last month has not been lifted yet. Do you know how to deal with it? &quot;I still have bank mortgages affected&quot;...&lt;/p>; &lt;h2>;The original intention is to prevent &quot;obsession&quot;&lt;/h2>; &lt;p>;Guo Zhi, a lawyer at Beijing Yingke (Shenzhen) Law Firm Hao has been paying attention to card unfreezing cases for a long time and provides legal consultation on unfreezing cards. According to his understanding, the protective stop payment originally originated from the &quot;card disconnection&quot; operation in 2020. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to public information, on October 10, 2020, the State Council convened an inter-ministerial joint meeting to combat new illegal crimes in telecommunications networks and decided to launch a nationwide &quot;card disconnection&quot; operation from that date. The main purpose is to deal with a major root cause of the continued high incidence of telecom network fraud - the out-of-control management of phone cards and bank cards. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lawyer Guo Zhihao said that after the &quot;card disconnection&quot; campaign began, the number of bank cards frozen due to the inflow of unknown funds increased. He received hundreds of inquiries about unfreezing cards a week, among which protection Inquiries about sexual cessation of payment also appear occasionally, but the overall proportion is low. From 2020 to 2022, among the 100 cases inquiring about unfreezing cards, only one or two were protective stop payments; since 2023, the number of consultations on such cases has increased, with four or five out of 100 cases. Regarding the protective stop payment, Guo Zhihao suggested that if the client does not need to use the bank card urgently, there is no need to find a lawyer to represent him, because most of them will be automatically lifted after one month, and &quot;the tossing and tossing is only a week or two in advance.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for the reason for the increase in the number of stop-payment inquiries, Guo Zhihao did not find any new public documents in 2023. It should only be implementation adjustments in individual regions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporters found that since June 2023, public security agencies in many places across the country have issued the &quot;Notice on Carrying out Anti-Fraud Dissuasion and Protective Emergency Stop of Payments&quot;, in which the time and method of lifting the payment stop are specified. Different expressions: The Yuanzhou Branch of the Public Security Bureau of Yichun City, Jiangxi Province mentioned in an announcement on June 7: “If you have transferred money to the account involved in fraud, the branch will immediately implement a protective stop payment on your account, 48 It can be lifted on your own after an hour.&quot;; The Public Security Bureau of Xining City, Qinghai Province reminded in an announcement in August: &quot;If the bank account under your name only accepts payments but does not pay, please go to the nearest public security agency as soon as possible to explain the situation and request to lift the suspension. Pay and restore the normal use of the bank card.&quot; Guo Zhihao believes that the original intention of stopping payments in various places is the same, to prevent victims from being obsessed with transferring money to fraudulent accounts again, but there are no clear regulations on implementation standards. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporter contacted a victim who had been &quot;obsessed&quot; during the interview. Chen Qiang, a 27-year-old doctoral student in Guangzhou, was deeply involved in an investment and stock fraud group in July. It was a well-designed scam. When opening an account, the other party could verify it via video. The transfer provided was a third-party public account, and the company existed and was operating. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Chen Qiang was convinced and transferred &quot;investment&quot; to the account for three consecutive days. On July 19, the anti-fraud police took him to the police station and told him that he was transferring money to an &quot;early warning account.&quot; Chen Qiang didn&#39;t believe it at all. &quot;I can&#39;t be cheated.&quot; The police repeatedly &quot;educated&quot; him for two hours and asked him about his behavior. The account adopts a 48-hour emergency payment stop. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Chen Qiang was doubtful and told the scammer the information that he had been tipped to be deceived. The scammer first sent him a private message, telling him that he had also been called to the police station because of the company&#39;s bank account risk. The &quot;agency&quot; was currently investigating and it would not affect investment safety. The next day, the &quot;agency&quot; issued a processing notice. After several operations, Chen Qiang believed in the liar again. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the emergency stop payment, Chen Qiang continued to transfer money to the scammer. It was not until a few days later that the scammer induced him to invest all his money. Chen Qiang suddenly realized that his more than 50,000 yuan had been locked and could not be withdrawn. . Chen Qiang admitted that it took him several days to get out of the scam, and the 48-hour emergency stop payment did play a role. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This case is not rare. Wang Xueni, who lives in Zhejiang, was not aware of the problem when she was defrauded on August 11. It was not until the public security organs discovered that the fraudster&#39;s bank account had received transfers from her, prompting her that she was experiencing telecommunications network fraud. On the same day, she went to the police station to be questioned by the police, and all bank cards began to stop payment for 32 days. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another victim in Guangzhou, Lin Qingqing, was prompted by the police to report the crime to the local police station and take notes. However, Lin Qingqing said that the process of lifting the payment stop went smoothly. After filling out the &quot;Application Form for Lifting Protective Stop Payment&quot; at the Anti-Fraud Center, police from the police station near her residence came to verify and conduct anti-fraud propaganda. Soon her bank card was unfrozen. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the &quot;Application Form for Lifting Protective Stop Payment&quot; posted by Lin Qingqing on her social account, in addition to basic information, the form also requires filling in &quot;whether you have met with the police to dissuade you&quot;; The purpose of the stopped payment bank card after the stop payment is lifted. The transaction details must indicate to whom the transfer is to be made, and the reasons for the transfer should be attached. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the process of lifting the payment stop is not smooth for many netizens. On Zhihu, a netizen with an IP address in Jiangxi said that the local police had stopped payment, and after the lifting, over-the-counter transactions were still restricted. A netizen in Jiangsu said that it would take 40 days to lift the local payment stop, and he had to go there in person; some people were very panicked. He said that he was about to repay the loan, and he didn’t know when the stop payment measure would be lifted. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/18/f282d2ba16.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1280&quot; height= &quot;1707&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/18/f282d2ba16.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251129&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The &quot;Application Form for Lifting Protective Stop Payment&quot; posted online by Lin Qingqing. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of interviewee)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;Post-disaster reconstruction&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Chen Qiang describes his life after being cheated It is &quot;post-disaster reconstruction&quot;. He had been attending school all these years and what little savings he had was wiped out in this fraud. &quot;After being deceived, I would even hesitate to eat beef noodles for 15 yuan.&quot; Chen Qiang said, and what is even more suffocating is that such days are expected to continue for more than a year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the one hand, he reflected on his greed and arrogance, and felt ridiculous about his performance when he first entered the police station, &quot;(his) attitude was very bad.&quot; After he came to his senses, he called the police who took the notes at the time and asked if there was any possibility of recovery. The other party told him that it was difficult to recover overseas fraud, not to mention that it had been too long since the transfer. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the other hand, Chen Qiang hopes that &quot;post-disaster reconstruction&quot; will go smoothly. Seven days after he stopped transferring money and got out of the scam completely, he received a call from the public security bureau in his hometown, informing him that all bank card payments would be suspended for one month. &quot;After finally being defrauded, I looked away, but my card was blocked.&quot; Chen Qiang said he didn&#39;t know how long the payment stop would last. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Xueni also mentioned the anxiety after her bank card was stopped. She called the police and the bank where she opened her account many times to ask when the payment stop would be lifted, but the other party only said &quot;wait a little longer.&quot; Before the accident, she had borrowed a micro loan, and after the payment stopped, she could only borrow money to repay. Before she knew the exact time to unfreeze, she was very worried about not being able to repay the money she borrowed from friends. Wang Xueni did not tell her family that she had been cheated, and she had no money to use after the payment was stopped, so it was easy for her to reveal her secret. Because of this, she couldn&#39;t eat or sleep well. &quot;A protective stop payment is actually a punishment for the person who was defrauded. Let yourself remember this lesson.&quot; Wang Xueni said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Zheng does not agree with the term &quot;lesson&quot;. She believes that she is a victim and being deceived is already a huge lesson. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On social media, there are many posts seeking relief from payment stoppages. Zhu Jingxian from Zhejiang was defrauded of 630,000 yuan due to her husband&#39;s negligence. After reporting the crime, her bank card was frozen for 48 hours. However, 25 days after the incident, the bank card was still protected from payment, and at the same time, various street police stations were called to inquire about the situation of being defrauded. After 35 days, his bank card was still unresolved. After explaining the situation to the Public Security Bureau, he had to wait another 48 hours for a reply. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Zheng understands the netizen who posted the message. She believes that the specific situation should be analyzed in detail. Victims who have awakened can lift the payment stop early, rather than applying a blanket approach. On September 13, police from the China Merchants Police Station unfrozen all the credit cards in Li Zheng&#39;s name and temporarily unfrozen a savings card so that she could repay the company loan first. Li Zheng said that on September 14, the person in charge of the Futian Police Station informed him that the police station had internal discussions on the case and believed that there was a problem of insufficient exchange of information within the police, and that the police should be considerate of citizens&#39; demands and help solve the problem. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(Except for Guo Zhihao, all names in the text are pseudonyms)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/ p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx .net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt; /div>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 19 Sep 2023 09:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[大科学装置“夸父”首次亮相]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256934]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-19 08:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;The sun is the source of life&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The sun is a symbol of light&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Nowadays, humans want to create a &quot;sun&quot; on the earth&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Let energy be inexhaustible, water clear and sky blue, and life sustainable&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xinhua News Agency reporter&#39;s exclusive visit&lt;/p >; &lt;p>;China’s large scientific installation &quot;CRAFT&quot; under construction&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Look at this research platform&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;How to develop an &quot;engine&quot; for the future &quot;artificial sun&quot;&lt; /p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/18/a963d796ae46fc31456463f2c9833a29.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1000&quot; height=&quot; 634&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/18/a963d796ae46fc31456463f2c9833a29.png&quot; data-key=&quot;251117&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Rendering of the &quot;Kuafu&quot; park (Photo courtesy of the Institute of Plasma Physics, Hefei Institute of Physical Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The scientific name of &quot;Kuafu&quot;&lt; /p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Fusion Reactor Host Key System Comprehensive Research Facility (CRAFT)&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is a major national science and technology infrastructure project established during the &quot;13th Five-Year Plan&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;December 2018 Approved to start construction in May&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is expected to be fully completed by the end of 2025&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/18 /72f3a1a844b0a5a10a625b33b41fcbe0.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1000&quot; height=&quot;562&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/18/72f3a1a844b0a5a10a625b33b41fcbe0.png&quot; data -key=&quot;251114&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The actual construction scene of the &quot;Kuafu&quot; park taken on September 11.
