The two agencies merged in January 2023 to form the National Fire and Rescue Service. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to this calculation, the leadership and command organization of China&#39;s fire rescue team has been in a &quot;levelless&quot; state for the past five years, until this time it was clearly defined as deputy ministerial level. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The management system and organizational structure of the fire brigade have changed several times. In October 2018, the public security fire brigade and the armed police forest brigade retired from active service and became part of the Ministry of Emergency Management to establish a national comprehensive fire rescue team. Among them, the management organization of the Public Security Fire Force was changed to the Fire Rescue Bureau of the Ministry of Emergency Management, and the management organization of the Armed Police Forest Force was changed to the Forest Fire Bureau of the Ministry of Emergency Management. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One year later, in November 2019, the Central Organization Office issued a notice clarifying that the Fire Rescue Bureau and Forest Fire Bureau of the Ministry of Emergency Management are the leading and commanding agencies of the fire rescue team and forest firefighting team respectively, but &quot;temporarily The administrative level of the team is unclear.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The notice also shows that starting from August 22, 2018, there will be a three-year &quot;trial running-in period&quot;; during the running-in period, issues such as the number and allocation of leadership positions will be standardized in a timely manner based on the running-in situation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the running-in period has expired, the &quot;14th Five-Year Plan National Emergency System Plan&quot; issued in February 2022 further clarified that it is necessary to &quot;integrate the fire rescue team and the forest firefighting team into a formalized, A professional and professional national comprehensive fire rescue team.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another year has passed since then. On January 6, 2023, the National Fire and Rescue Bureau, which was formed by integrating the Fire and Rescue Bureau of the Ministry of Emergency Management and the Forest Fire Bureau, was officially launched. Another 10 months have passed since the National Fire and Rescue Bureau was listed and the administrative level was clarified. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Three Certain Plans&quot; of the National Fire and Rescue Bureau clearly state that the National Fire and Rescue Bureau will have a first political commissar who will concurrently be the main responsible comrade of the Emergency Management Department, and the director of the National Fire and Rescue Bureau will be concurrently served by the Deputy Minister of the Emergency Management Department. The political commissar of the National Fire and Rescue Bureau is concurrently served by the director of the political department of the Ministry of Emergency Management. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Previously, news on the website of the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security showed that Wang Xiangxi, secretary of the Party Committee and Minister of the Ministry of Emergency Management, has concurrently served as the first political commissar of the National Fire and Rescue Bureau, and Qiong Se, member of the Party Committee of the Ministry of Emergency Management, has served as the director of the National Fire and Rescue Bureau. Xu Ping, a member of the Party Committee of the Ministry of Management, serves as the political commissar of the National Fire and Rescue Bureau. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the &quot;Three Certain Plans&quot;, the National Fire and Rescue Bureau Command Center will also be hung on the Emergency Command Center of the Ministry of Emergency Management. The director of the National Fire and Rescue Bureau Command Center will be the deputy director of the Emergency Command Center of the Ministry of Emergency Management. concurrently. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time as the National Fire and Rescue Bureau&#39;s &quot;Three Fixed Plans&quot; were announced,&amp;nbsp;the functions of the Emergency Management Department were also adjusted accordingly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The responsibilities of the Fire Rescue Bureau and Forest Fire Bureau of the Ministry of Emergency Management, and the responsibilities related to the education and training of the national comprehensive fire rescue team undertaken by the Education and Training Department are transferred to the National Fire Rescue Bureau; the Ministry of Emergency Management manages the national fire rescue Bureau, and added the responsibilities of formulating firefighter exit and resettlement plans, organizing their implementation, and guiding local governments to establish and improve a comprehensive emergency joint command platform. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, the Emergency Management Department will continue to perform related tasks such as appointment and dismissal, deployment, commendation, rewards, punishment, and martyr assessment of the national comprehensive fire rescue team in accordance with the principle of decentralization. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;&lt;strong>;Personnel Trends&lt;/strong>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;[ The Ministry of Civil Affairs has changed its leadership.

If two people interact and lose the &quot;reciprocity&quot; of emotional value, and the emotional value only becomes the supply of one party, it must mean that the power and status between the two people are not equal, and the person in the lower position needs to pay attention to the person in the upper position. Continuously provide emotional value, the so-called &quot;lower and smaller&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The relationship between the sexes should generally be an equal relationship. Respecting each other and pleasing each other is a normal relationship. In this sense, men&#39;s need for emotional value is often ignored, which is an unavoidable issue. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A blogger said that men actually need emotional value very much. He mentioned a typical example: an old man on the Internet complained on Weibo, talking about his mid-life crisis and his emotional breakdown. For a moment. This old man on the Internet usually appears as a &quot;friend of women&quot;, so he has accumulated a certain number of female fans. As a result, when he started to complain, he did not gain sympathy and comfort from his female fans, even though he usually provided emotional value to his female fans. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The blogger lamented: Some women seem to truly believe that men must be very happy and should not complain. And they themselves complain all the time. Even if they look very happy to outsiders many times, they can always find something to complain about. These women seem to have a collective consciousness, &quot;You must never let men feel happiness, and you must never let men gain emotional value. As for why, I can&#39;t understand it.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is very close to my heart. Of course, there are always many examples of couples treating each other as guests or pleasing each other. However, according to my observation, men are always more likely to be frustrated in the process of obtaining emotional value from women. It is this kind of frustration that Fang Hongjian encounters in his wife in &quot;Fortress Besieged&quot;. Before getting married, the relationship between the two was okay, and Sun Roujia gave him a special kind of psychological satisfaction in the face of adversity. But after marriage, Sun Roujia seems to have changed into a different person, which makes readers feel a little incredible. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The blogger believes that men and women are not all interested in sex. If a woman talks about her emotional value every day and tries to squeeze her to the limit, any man with some self-respect will eventually leave - for example, Fang Hongjian had this intention. Of course, there are different ways to leave. Many men find that &quot;the emotional value that women cannot give, brothers can give, games can give, and even fishing can give.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is a very &quot;straight man&quot; statement. It not only explains why there are many &quot;fishing guys&quot; gathering at the nightclub by the river in front of my house all day long, but also explains why some middle-aged men The reason why they always play some games or wait quietly downstairs for a while before going home after work: they know that there are endless complaints and endless mental wear and tear inside the house. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The reason for this is, as the blogger said: In the past many years, men’s demand for emotional value has been suppressed. So many women think that men only need to pay. The reason why this kind of abnormal relationship can barely be maintained is because a kind of ideological stamp called &quot;sense of responsibility&quot; restrains men - whether it is to society or to the family. Traditional thoughts and values ​​tell men that you must get married and have this baby. And should suffer for it to be sucked out of any value including happiness. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These words must have hit the hearts of many men who cannot feel happy in their marriages. Many ladies often say that they need to find someone who is &quot;emotionally stable&quot; to get married. Why? The main reason for this choice is probably not only to eliminate those men who are emotionally unstable and like to get angry, but in a deeper and more practical situation, to allow &quot;emotionally stable&quot; men to work hard for the family and regard endurance as the highest pursuit. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The question is, as a human being, who should be emotionally stable more than whom? This is clearly a false proposition. Emotional stability is always relative. No one is born with an &quot;emotionally stable&quot; person, and there is never any instability - if such a person exists, it must be made of plastic and steel. It is worth noting that when this requirement becomes a matter of course, it will inevitably lead to the emergence of unfair situations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Why get married? I&#39;m afraid everyone has their own ideas, but in general, it&#39;s nothing more than these points: continue to write about love, get stable sex, and raise children. When it comes to responsibilities after marriage, in most cases, men often become the main or even the only source of income for the family. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The twists and turns in the marriage of Fu Seoul and Lao Liu fully demonstrate that emotional value is affected by family economic relations. Once a man takes care of his children at home, the outcome is often not optimistic. Because society has different tolerances for stay-at-home wives and stay-at-home husbands, if a man wants to maintain his dignity and not be discriminated against or feel cowardly, he can only try his best to earn as much money as possible - preferably more than his wife. After all, a man who wanders around the world is more likely to be looked down upon by public opinion than a woman who only takes care of her children at home, and may even be regarded as a &quot;good-for-nothing waste.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It stands to reason that under the male-domestic model, men have great hope of gaining emotional value in the family. But interestingly, the theoretical connotations are often broken in reality. Some men work so hard outside that when they get home they are told that they only know how to play games but don&#39;t know how to do housework. It is sometimes labeled &quot;widowed parenting.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the final analysis, the so-called emotional value is &quot;coaxing&quot;. When a woman feels sad, a man will coax her, and vice versa. If men are always forcibly given a &quot;strong&quot; and &quot;rigid&quot; persona, and are made into a character insulated from emotional value, and they blindly give in a wider range; or in other words, men must take care of women&#39;s emotions, in contrast, It won&#39;t work if you come over. Even if the man has troubles that he can only solve on his own, then the relationship will change and the emotional foundation of sharing weal and woe will be lost. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Don’t men have emotional needs, or shouldn’t they seek emotional help? Of course not. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the issue of emotional value, men and women should be equal. Acknowledging that men and women alike have emotional value needs and giving them respect and care is the normal way of getting along. Based on this, caring for each other and solving each other&#39;s problems is the way to balance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A family must not become a quagmire where one party enjoys absolute power and the other party can only make concessions. No one would be willing to marry a slave or a &quot;slave owner&quot;, so both men and women hope that their rights and spirit will be respected by the other party, and refuse to kneel down and make endless unilateral contributions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The current marriage rate is plummeting, the divorce rate is rising, and the number of unmarried people is increasing. To a certain extent, it shows that young people have a more rational and strict examination of the connotation of &quot;home&quot;, and thus take the initiative to make their own The body and mind escape from an invisible shackles. This cold fact tells us that marriage and family are &quot;non-material&quot; subjects that two people manage together with love and sincerity. If we want to make marriage and family last longer, and if we want everyone to have more confidence in marriage and family, we must treat the emotional needs of both parties fairly, create a loving and reciprocal relationship, and especially abandon the prejudice that &quot;men have no emotional value needs&quot; , so that each other can maintain the consciousness of understanding and tolerating each other to the greatest extent, and only by providing warmth to each other can we move forward steadily. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 03 Nov 2023 22:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[戛纳金棕榈获奖影片，一场对亲密关系的审判]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259887]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-03 21:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 11/03/OCo1c2xv8Ztbs2c46cQ4nEcOZC4eqXITmA884bPF.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;519&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/03/OCo1c2xv8Ztbs2c46cQ4nEcO ZC4eqXITmA884bPF. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256876&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In the movie, after the husband fell to his death from a building, the court began a trial to determine whether it was murder or suicide. , while also unveiling an analysis of family relationships. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(File picture/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In a cabin under the French Alps, an interview is taking place. The female writer seems to be good at avoiding questions, and once turned into the guest and became the questioner. The young reporter sitting opposite her seemed a little overwhelmed and had no choice but to follow her wishes and start chatting. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Suddenly, the music played by the writer&#39;s husband came from upstairs, which was deafening, and his dissatisfaction was obvious. The interview was terminated and the female reporter left. Shortly after she left, the writer&#39;s husband was found dead in the snow outside the cabin by their son. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The question is, who is the murderer? According to previous suspense narrative strategies, the plot always has to go through multiple reversals before the truth comes to light. The film &quot;Anatomy of a Death from a Fall&quot;, which just won the Palme d&#39;Or at the Cannes Film Festival in 2023, provides another solution. Director Justine Trier does not seem to care whether the plot is reversed, and it does not even matter who the murderer is. unimportant. Putting aside the cloak of suspense, Trier is more interested in how people use their own narratives to complete the analysis of a death. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The film cleverly sets up the court trial, so that the intimate relationships that should be in the private realm are laid bare and presented to the public. One party wants to prove murder, and the other wants to prove her innocence by proving that her husband committed suicide. Both parties are trying to use their own narratives to get closer to the truth, and all clues may become evidence in court. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As a novelist, Sandler Voight&#39;s writing has become the object of scrutiny by the prosecution. &quot;Her life is in the book, especially her relationships.&quot; In the novel, the wife&#39;s disgust for her husband, the possibility of her husband&#39;s death, and the imagination of how to kill are all understood as reflections of the real motivations for killing. Under this kind of scrutiny, the narratives in the book are no longer complete. They are cut into fragments or even sentences, and then the narrative is reconstructed using human will to connect it with reality in the mind. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One of the key pieces of evidence in the film is the recording of her husband Samuel before his death. Samuel is a former teacher who also enjoys writing. Out of guilt for being partially responsible for his son Daniel&#39;s permanent vision impairment, Samuel spent a great deal of his time on various family matters and on Daniel&#39;s company. He seemed unapologetic and willing, but the recording revealed another side of the family&#39;s close relationship. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the recording, Samuel asked his wife to reconsider the division of labor in the family, believing that he had sacrificed too much personal time on family affairs and that he wanted more time to write. After listening, Sandler mocked him coldly, saying that a writer would not stop writing just because he had children and housework. No one forced him, and he did not owe him anything. The director seemed to have intentionally reversed the genders. What Samuel experienced was actually the helpless and struggling situation of many women in married relationships in reality. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Next, the dispute between the two in the recording became more intense. Sandler&#39;s bisexual identity, cheating and other private information were revealed one by one from Samuel&#39;s mouth, and fell into the ears of everyone in the trial. In the view of the prosecution, these are the motives and reasons for the unbalanced relationship between husband and wife and the wife to murder her husband. Here, the recording, which originally only recorded a certain dimension of the relationship between people, is also used to refer to the whole picture, helping the prosecution complete the deduction and reconstruction of the truth. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sandler attempted to deny this ever-reconstructed narrative, telling Samuel&#39;s psychiatrist, who was one of the witnesses, &quot;You&#39;re only telling a small part of the whole situation. A pair of Husband and wife are like a mess...&quot; She believed that this did not prove that she was the murderer. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The paradox is that Sandler himself is also consciously or unconsciously self-narrating the truth, including her husband&#39;s unusual behavior in taking medicine six months before his death, seeing a psychiatrist, and being depressed in writing, etc. , all became her reconstruction of the reasons for his suicide during the defense process. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Even if the evidence fragments presented by both the prosecution and the defense are real, perhaps no one dares to confirm that the suicide or homicide story reconstructed based on these fragments is the truth itself. As director Justine Trier said, &quot;This is very modern, this is how we live today. In the trial, various things change and are given extra weight, resulting in new fictions.&quot; &quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The evidence was not only presented in front of the prosecution and defense, but also slowly unfolded in front of his son Daniel, who also began to look at his parents again. At first, he had no doubts about his mother, but as the two sides narrated at the trial, his attitude gradually became swaying, and he even had an image in his mind of his mother hitting his father hard and pushing him downstairs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the other hand, he also tried to give medicine to the dog to verify the fact that his mother said that his father had vomited after taking medicine. He also recalled the conversation his father had with him when he sent the dog to the doctor. He thought This revealed his father&#39;s suicidal tendencies. From various swings to his own selection of factual fragments after review, Daniel finally constructed his own narrative version of the truth in his mind. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/03/HSp4I05LqVgIERt0uszA4B1zVAGtWR6wapo1Ubgq.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;540&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/03/HSp4I05LqVgIERt0uszA4B1zVAGtWR6wapo1Ubgq.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256875&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;A still from &quot;Anatomy of Death from a Fall&quot; (also translated as &quot;Judgment of a Fall&quot;). &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(data picture/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Director Justine Trier once mentioned in an interview, &quot;These trials have a profound impact on people.&quot; It&#39;s a nightmare to say because your own life is being taken away from you. Everyone is creating a fiction and not really trying to get to the truth. I&#39;m very fascinated by truth and trying to find it through stories and I find that very interesting .&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Obviously, the director also wants to draw the audience into the search for the truth and the construction of the narrative. Under the shell of suspense, we as the audience have naturally been thinking about who the murderer is since Samuel fell from the building. In the battle between the prosecution and the defense, every time they list new evidence, make new statements and excuses, we, like Daniel, can&#39;t help but turn our eyes to Samuel and Sandler, trying to learn from the evidence provided by both sides. Find your own narrative from factual evidence and their narratives to deduce the truth of death. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But outside the film, we are more passive. All narratives are always based on the characters&#39; interpretation of the truth in the film, which also means that our perception of the truth is more uncertain. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The film ends with Sandler being found not guilty. Since there are elements of fiction on both sides, why does one narrative prevail over the other? Perhaps it was the emotional power of it - Daniel&#39;s monologue about his father moved the judge and helped his mother win. After Sandler came home, Daniel hugged and kissed her. In the silence of the room, a rare warmth lingered. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Is this the truth? Not really.在此前各方的叙述中，导演已成功地将怀疑的种子埋到观众心间，即使桑德勒被判无罪，人们对真相的犹疑与不定却并未消失。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;女主角扮演者桑德拉·惠勒曾就剧本问题问过导演，她演的角色是有罪的还是无辜的，特里耶告诉她，“我不知道，但我希望你表现得好像她是无辜的”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“她可能有责任却没有罪，或者她可能有罪却没有责任。她可以负有逼迫他自杀的责任，却没有杀死他的罪过，或者她可以在不想杀死他的情况下杀死他——无论是以冲动的方式，还是以我们可以尝试想象的方式。真相是存在的，但它太复杂了，在这里无法把握。”导演茹斯汀·特里耶在一次采访中这样说道。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但回过头想想，真相如何或许早已不重要。虚构是人的天赋，只要乐意，借助几个关键词便能建构出属于自己的叙述。只是，如若人与人之间的关系都像这场死亡一样，被抽丝剥茧般进行审视、重构，那实际上，没有任何一种关系经得起如此严苛细密的剖析。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 03 Nov 2023 21:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[亚太安全专家谈：中国发展红利被周边国家共享]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259863]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-03 20:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;After the end of the Cold War, despite some geopolitical tensions or regional hot issues, the Asia-Pacific region has still maintained peace Stablize.

How to continue to maintain a prosperous and stable Asia-Pacific? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 29, 2023, at the &quot;Dialogue of Chinese and Foreign Experts&quot; at the Beijing Xiangshan Forum, many Chinese and foreign scholars conducted in-depth discussions on topics such as &quot;China&#39;s role in maintaining Asia-Pacific security.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fu Ying, former vice minister of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People&#39;s Republic of China and founder of the Tsinghua Institute for International Security Strategy, said at the meeting that after the Cold War, the Asia-Pacific region seized the opportunity, quickly opened up to the outside world, and quickly entered regional integration. In the past few decades, there have been no major wars, political conflicts, or major social unrest in the Asia-Pacific region. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;The Asia-Pacific region has enjoyed peaceful development for more than 40 years. In this process, China has played a central role. The dividends of China&#39;s rapid regional development have been shared by neighboring countries.

Citing data from the Bank of Asia, she said that in the past 42 years, Asia&#39;s GDP has grown sevenfold. This phenomenon is also called the &quot;economic development miracle in the Asia-Pacific region.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fu Ying believes that peace and stability, regional focus on cooperation and dialogue, and economic globalization are important reasons for the economic development of the Asia-Pacific. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What are the unique driving forces behind decades of stability and security in the Asia-Pacific region? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;In order to maintain long-term stability and security in the Asia-Pacific, we need to discover a unique &#39;Asia-Pacific model.&#39;&quot; Chen Dongxiao, president of the Shanghai Institutes for International Studies, said that &quot;open regionalism&quot; is an important driving factor , and this concept contains many contents. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;First of all, economic development cooperation is the focus. It transcends ideologies and government differences. Secondly, under regional openness, no matter big or small, all countries need to abide by relevant rules and regulations and should Follow social rules in an equal way. It is very important that we should not have double standards,&quot; said Chen Dongxiao. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In contrast to the peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region, wars have been raging in Europe and the Middle East in recent years. During the forum discussion, two European and American scholars also expressed their thoughts on the &quot;differences between China and the West.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Why is the Asia-Pacific region different from Europe? There are many reasons behind it.” Michael Swain, chief director of the East Asia Program at the Quincy Institute of National Affairs in the United States, believes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sergei Karaganov, dean of the School of World Economics and International Affairs at the Russian State Higher University of Economics, agreed with Shi Wen’s point of view, saying that “it is still in the early stages and we still have to remain cautious.” . At the same time, he also emphasized the &quot;cultural factors&quot; in Europe that were different from Asia. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;European history is filled with many wars. European peace or war is always closely related to Europe&#39;s internal problems.&quot; He said. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The risks of U.S. leadership are growing&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;As for the role of the United States in Asia-Pacific security, Huang Jae-ho, director of the Center for International Studies at Hankuk University of Foreign Studies, said, &quot;Although there is no perfect leadership in the world ( model), but the risks of U.S. leadership are growing.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Taking the U.S. policy toward China as an example, he said that from the Trump administration to the current Biden administration, the United States has undergone many changes in overall strategy and economic details. &quot;The United States has not seen the overall situation clearly, and its strategies and tactics are unclear. Therefore, the United States lacks a consistent vision and policy, which has caused instability in the current international order.&quot; He said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the meeting, Michael Swan, chief director of the East Asia Program at the Quincy Institute of National Affairs, mentioned in his speech that &quot;China&#39;s ultimate security role in Asia is still uncertain.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fu Ying directly refuted this. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I don&#39;t quite agree with this type of view. Mr. Michael Sven&#39;s logic is very confusing.&quot; Fu Ying said that China has actively promoted economic development in the Asia-Pacific region, and the United States has also benefited a lot from it. . This &quot;unconvincing&quot; logic probably originates from the theory of power change in the international community for hundreds of years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“However, you know that China’s development background is completely different.” She said that there are big differences between China and the United States. But it does not affect China and the United States in pursuing their own development and supporting and benefiting from each other. If you think that China&#39;s strength has become a &quot;threat&quot; in the Asia-Pacific region, how should you view the rise of emerging countries such as India and Indonesia in the future? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fu Ying also pointed out that the United States is currently anxious about its declining global influence, but this is not a problem caused by China, but the result of &quot;economic globalization and the United States itself making too many mistakes.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;The United States&#39; own problems make it difficult. Look at what benefits the United States has gained from the trade war? The trade war has caused the U.S.-China trade deficit to continue to increase, but has it reduced China&#39;s exports to the United States? In fact, it is not, on the contrary, the data is still increasing.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She proposed that the United States should be an active contributor to the development of the region, rather than trying to use competition to prioritize and define the region&#39;s agenda and &quot;hijack&quot; A long-term agenda for successful cooperation, dialogue and economic development in the Asia-Pacific region. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Finding balance and crisis management&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In their speeches, many scholars unanimously stated that the old balance in the international order may be broken and new changes are about to occur. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sergey Karaganov said that as the United States and Western society began to exert influence to change globalization, the so-called era of globalization has ended. He said that we must have a new theory or a new global governance model, and this model must be decided by all partners. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“For so many years, we have been saying that we want to achieve a win-win situation and that we want to benefit all parties involved. But unfortunately, we do not live in an ideal world. Sometimes we need to be shocked and we need to and reach a balance with different countries,” Sergey Karaganov said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Michael Swan said that any international system must balance the needs of different countries and cooperate after balancing. (Countries) need to seek common interests, have the same demands for economic development, and whether there are the same issues left over from history that need to be resolved, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He insisted that the current uncertainty still exists between countries and cannot be controlled. Countries large and small will be affected by changes in power, and there will undoubtedly be uncertainty. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;It cannot be said that China believes that all countries are unified and we can do this. It cannot solve many basic problems. Moreover, this is not caused by the United States, but due to structural changes. Yes, it will also trigger changes in the international order.&quot; Shi Wen said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So, how to maintain security and peace in the Asia-Pacific region before the new international order is formed? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Chen Dongxiao proposed the &quot;three no&#39;s&quot; principle - that is, not to divide the group camp, not to initiate military war, especially nuclear war, and not to use double standards. &quot;In the past few years, the Chinese government has repeatedly reiterated on many occasions that war is not a good way to deal with differences between countries. On the contrary, it brings more crises.&quot; He said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Chen Dongxiao believes that Sino-US relations are an important factor in regional security. At the same time, the role of small countries in the Asia-Pacific region cannot be ignored, and they should not be divided into any faction. &quot;Some neutral countries, such as ASEAN countries, can play an important role in dealing with differences and achieving related cooperation in the Asia-Pacific region,&quot; he said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Huang Zaihao pointed out that compared with other regions, the Asia-Pacific region is relatively stable and China and the United States can maintain a relative balance. There are currently outside voices claiming that China and the United States have entered a &quot;new Cold War,&quot; but he believes this is more like a &quot;complex competition.&quot; Moreover, the two major countries have now begun crisis management and set up communication channels. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“However, there is no war now, only fighting, so it can still be controlled.” Huang Zaihao said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 03 Nov 2023 20:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[九名市州长“进京检讨”：自然资源部组建以来首次高规格集中、公开约谈]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259895]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-03 19:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 11/03/kcNAdYfHnmy6jaVIfdtcKIgbeorhtPCG5wZylf9D.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/03/kcNAdYfHnmy6jaVIfdtcKIgbeorhtPCG5wZ ylf9D. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256894&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On October 24, 2023, at the Yinlian Potted Flower Market, there were still flowers placed on the edge of the land Potted plants for sale. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern Weekend reporter Li Gui/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As the largest fresh cut flower trading market in Asia, Dounan Flower Market in Kunming City, Yunnan Province It is crowded all year round. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the north side of Dounan Flower Market, across the road is another flower-related market - Yinlian Potted Flower Market.

In October, osmanthus, bougainvillea and various camellias are still in bloom at the entrance of some shops. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Most of these shops exist in the form of greenhouses: the open air outside the house and the roof made of transparent film are covered with a black sunshade net; there are few cement and ceramic tiles on the floor inside the house, and most of them are smoothed. Yellow soil - the flower pots with plants are placed on the ground, and the roots come out from the bottom of the pot. The soil will provide them with moisture and nutrients. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Go northwest along the main road for about 300 meters. The shops, greenhouses and sunshade nets have all disappeared, and both sides of the road have become empty and open spaces. There were many bulging white woven bags lying on the open ground. The word &quot;feed&quot; was printed on the outside of the bags. You could smell the stench of feces if you got close. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The workers wearing sun hats tore open the bags and spread the black fertilizer on the yellow mud ground, and someone else opened it with a hoe. An excavator in the distance was working in another open space, and there was a rumbling sound. If it weren&#39;t for being in a city, the scene here would look no different from autumn sowing in the countryside. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before it became a vacant lot, it was also a greenhouse selling green plants. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;About a month ago, in September 2023, the greenhouse was demolished after an inspection by leaders of the Chenggong District Committee of Kunming City. On October 25, 2023, a greenhouse owner who once opened a shop here said that before the shed was demolished, he moved to the current greenhouse in August 2023. The two places are about 500 meters apart, and both are managed by Yinlian Community The established Kunming Qiding Economic and Trade Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as Kunming Qiding) is responsible for leasing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The greenhouse owner said that although the lease contract between the two parties was signed once a year, he had been operating the original greenhouse for nearly ten years. Talking about the reason for moving the store, he thought it was &quot;policy adjustment&quot;: &quot;That piece of land was not approved for commercial use at the time, so it was demolished.&quot; When signing the contract, Kunming Geding &quot;wasn&#39;t sure&quot; about the nature of the land. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In September 2023, in a notification from the Ministry of Natural Resources, the aforementioned open land was classified as cultivated land. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The report shows that in February 2019, the Yinlian Potted Flower Market in Chenggong District, Kunming City was included in the scope of rectification of the &quot;big shed house&quot; problem and passed the rectification acceptance; in July 2022, the Yinlian Community will have been reclaimed The agricultural greenhouses were rented to 76 merchants for selling potted flowers, agricultural supplies, pesticides and other business activities, illegally occupying 77 acres of cultivated land. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Strictly speaking, the focus of the &quot;big shed house&quot; issue is not the form of building the house, but the nature of the land where the house is built. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Agricultural Engineering Technology&quot; magazine, which is under the supervision of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, once explained in an article that the &quot;big shed&quot; problem refers to the illegal construction of agricultural facilities or agricultural parks by some industrial and commercial enterprises, individuals and organizations. The essence of illegally occupying cultivated land or even permanent basic farmland for non-agricultural construction is to change the nature and use of the land, change the agricultural production function, and touch the red line of cultivated land protection. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Information released by the WeChat public account of the &quot;Chenggong District Natural Resources Bureau&quot; shows that in May 2023, the Chengdu Bureau of National Natural Resources Supervision inspected the cleanup and rectification of &quot;greenhouses&quot; in Kunming City in 2019. It was found that two cases involving the rebound of &quot;greenhouses&quot; in Chenggong District were involved, one of which was the Yinlian Potted Flower Market. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 26, 2023, a staff member of the Chenggong Branch of the Kunming Municipal Natural Resources and Planning Bureau told Southern Weekend reporters that the &quot;responsibility for rectification of the &quot;greenhouse&quot; problem involved lies with the street, and he can report it to the Street to understand the relevant situation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yinlian Potted Flower Market is located in Dounan Street. On October 25, 2023, a person in charge of the Dounan Street Office said: “(The contents in the shed) were vacated before, but last year due to the epidemic and villages were demolished, some green plants for sale were placed in the shed.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The person in charge of the street said that during the inspection in May 2023, the Chengdu Bureau of National Natural Resources Inspection pointed out the existence of Question: &quot;According to the (inspector&#39;s) requirements, it is required to see loess inside the shed, but if there are things on the soil, it is considered a violation.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In May 2023, Chenggong District Natural Resources The Planning Branch and the Agriculture and Rural Affairs Bureau jointly issued notices ordering rectification of illegal acts and time-limited rectification notices to multiple land users. The person in charge of the aforementioned street stated that in accordance with the requirements of the rectification notice, they need to &quot;restore the problematic greenhouse to the state of 2019&quot; before the end of September 2023, that is, empty the contents of the shed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the specific implementation stage, the rectification requirements have been repeatedly refined. The person in charge of the street remembered that in June 2023, after the things in the shed were vacated, the soil was also loosened, but the relevant departments “will put forward different requirements for every different inspection.” “So we have repeatedly asked, and today we have to Remove the house number, and tomorrow I will tell you that there is still an advertisement on the door and I want to remove it.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;By the end of August 2023, only the empty shell of the greenhouse remained. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/03/s1YruHxfKE3KYlsmm4kD2GMkegXzl5ryT78fz4fl.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/03/s1YruHxfKE3KYlsmm4kD2GMkegXzl5ryT78fz4fl.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256895&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Chen Jing (second from left), Secretary of the Chenggong District Committee of Kunming City, is at the rectification work site of the &quot;greenhouse&quot; at Yinlian Potted Flower Market in Dounan Street. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(&quot;Chenggong Release&quot; WeChat public account/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Multiple common issues&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Nearly a month after the greenhouse was vacated, on the afternoon of September 15, 2023, 9 cities (states) including Kunming were interviewed by the Ministry of Natural Resources. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Ministry of Natural Resources has 9 local natural resource inspection bureaus in Beijing, Shenyang, Shanghai, Nanjing, Jinan, Guangzhou, Wuhan, Chengdu, and Xi&#39;an. At the interview meeting, the directors of the nine local inspection bureaus reported the violations of laws and regulations discovered by the inspectors. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The information disclosed on the official website of the Ministry of Natural Resources shows that the inspection found that the responsibilities for protecting cultivated land in some areas have not been implemented in place, and prominent problems that hit the red line such as &quot;non-agriculturalization&quot; and &quot;non-grain conversion&quot; of cultivated land still exist. Non-agricultural construction problems such as parks, development zones, and urban municipal roads without approval are more prominent. The problem of illegal occupation of permanent basic farmland and general farmland for turf planting exists in some provinces to varying degrees. The problem of &quot;greenhouses&quot; continues to be prohibited and illegal. The problem of occupying farmland, digging lakes and landscaping still occurs in some places. In some places, minerals are illegally approved and illegal mining violates the ecological protection red line control requirements and seriously damages the ecology. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The briefing disclosed more details. Taken together, the number of illegal land use problems in the nine cities (states) interviewed ranked high in the provinces where they are located. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among them, Shijiazhuang, Harbin, Wenzhou, Chuzhou and Lanzhou &quot;ranked first in the province&quot; for problems with laws and regulations, Linyi and Guizhou Qianxinan Prefecture &quot;ranked first in the province&quot;, and Kunming &quot;ranked first in terms of the number of problems&quot; Ranking first in the province and second in the province in terms of cultivated land area.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, this inspection also found a number of common problems in many cities. Such as the &quot;non-agriculturalization&quot; and &quot;non-grainization&quot; of cultivated land. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The report shows that there are 51 &quot;non-agriculturalization&quot; problems in Harbin, involving 900.68 acres of cultivated land; there are 111 &quot;non-agriculturalization&quot; problems in Linyi, involving 1,065.56 acres of cultivated land; and there are &quot;non-agriculturalization&quot; problems in Hechi. 150, involving 2,629.55 acres of cultivated land; 207 &quot;non-agricultural&quot; problems exist in Qianxinan Prefecture, occupying 1,649.65 acres of cultivated land. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;More specific manifestations of the &quot;de-agriculturalization&quot; of cultivated land include the problem of &quot;greenhouse houses&quot;, the indiscriminate occupation of cultivated land to build houses in rural areas, and the construction of some engineering projects and infrastructure without approval. Not only in Kunming, but also in Harbin, Wenzhou, and Hechi, the problem of &quot;greenhouses&quot; has appeared. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, among the 9 cities (states) notified, 6 places including Shijiazhuang, Harbin, Chuzhou, Linyi, Qianxinan Prefecture, and Lanzhou all have illegal mining problems. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among them, Wuchang City, which is managed by Harbin, failed to supervise the illegal mining of granite for construction by Yingze Sand and Stone Co., Ltd. from January 2022 to May 2023, and failed to promptly file a case to investigate and stop it. Reporting illegal mining activities as &quot;false changes&quot; and reporting false information should be subject to inspection. Harbin City has failed to supervise Wuchang City’s untruthful reporting practices, and the audit control is not strict. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among the 9 cities (states), Wenzhou, Zhejiang is the only city that has been notified of &quot;continuous frequent petitions in the field of natural resources.&quot; The report shows that since 2021, Wenzhou has been ranking high in the province in terms of the number of petitions in the field of natural resources. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Rectification outside the meeting&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;After the director of the local inspection bureau reported the violations of laws and regulations in 9 cities (states), the city (state) chiefs spoke separately , &quot;State your position one by one.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the Voice of China report, Kunming Mayor Liu Jiachen said that the problem of &quot;non-agriculturalization&quot; and &quot;non-grainification&quot; of cultivated land in Kunming is very prominent, and he &quot;feels deeply self-blame and guilt&quot; for this. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During the speech session, many mayors also said that some problems have been rectified. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In response to the problem that the Lai’an County Government in Chuzhou City illegally acquired land for the construction of the supporting landscape water system for the Jinling Water Town Project and occupied 400.4 acres of cultivated land to dig out lakes and landscape, Wu Jin, mayor of Chuzhou City, said that the Lai’an County Government The key issues of the illegal land acquisition to build the supporting landscape water system of the Jinling Water Town Project have been rectified and reclaimed in place on June 30, 2023. They have been upgraded in accordance with the requirements of &quot;concurrent personnel management&quot; and handed over to the Municipal Commission for Discipline Inspection and Supervision for accountability. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the interview, several city (state) mayors held meetings to deploy relevant work. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The next day, September 17, 2023, Hechi Mayor Wang Jun presided over a government executive meeting, demanding that the bottom line of farmland protection and food security be resolutely maintained. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On September 19, 2023, Wenzhou Mayor Zhang Zhenfeng emphasized at the city&#39;s farmland protection and food security work conference that we must tackle the rectification of problems reported by inspections and follow &quot;one problem, one plan, and closed-loop promotion to the end.&quot; According to the requirements, we will formulate targeted rectification plans, promote the elimination of problem accounts within a time limit, and simultaneously carry out &quot;look back&quot; on rectified problems and draw inferences from one example to make rectifications of the same standard and quality. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the same day, Kunming held a city-wide rectification meeting on illegal land use and farmland outflow. Kunming Municipal Party Committee Secretary Liu Hongjian presided over the meeting and delivered a speech. Mayor Liu Jiachen conveyed the spirit of the Ministry of Natural Resources’ centralized open interview meeting. At the meeting, the Kunming Municipal Natural Resources Planning Bureau reported on the city’s rectification of illegal land use and farmland outflow issues and made a review speech. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Five days later, on September 23, 2023, Chen Jing, secretary of the Chenggong District Committee of Kunming City, led a team to conduct an on-site investigation on the rectification of &quot;greenhouses&quot; and the rectification of farmland outflow problems. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;An article published on the WeChat public account of &quot;Chenggong Release&quot; shows that at the rectification work site of the &quot;greenhouses&quot; in the Yinlian Potted Flower Market in Dounan Street, Chen Jing learned in detail about the overall rectification work of the &quot;greenhouses&quot; in the district situation, work progress and existing difficulties, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the article published by &quot;Chenggong Release&quot;, there is a photo of Chen Jing standing in a greenhouse. Behind him is the greenhouse that has been demolished to only its frame. Shortly after Chen Jing&#39;s investigation, the frame of the greenhouse was also demolished. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The person in charge of Dounan Street mentioned above said that they had already made plans to dismantle the greenhouses before, “mainly some details and standards (not yet determined), which were formulated just after the leaders arrived. We It was rectified quickly and thoroughly.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When talking about the reason for demolishing the greenhouse, the person in charge said that it was to avoid the problem from recurring again. &quot;If the shed is still there, whoever moves the things in next time will say (there is a problem) during the inspection.&quot; He explained, &quot;In the end, we have done the work of the community and the masses, just to make it one-time The renovation is in place.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Previously, the land where the potted flower market was located was managed by Yinlian Community. After the problem of &quot;big sheds&quot; rebounded, due to &quot;inadequate community supervision&quot;, more than 70 acres of land have now been returned to the streets. Now, the land planted in the place where the greenhouse was demolished is a third-party company commissioned by the street. The person in charge added: &quot;Our street cadres don&#39;t know how to farm and have a lot of work, so we currently entrust a third party to complete the planting task first, and then discuss the future.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The street person in charge also It said that in May 2023, after it was discovered that the problem of &quot;greenhouses&quot; had rebounded, relevant street officials were also transferred from their original posts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/03/iAC6qJLe4TweMpYZNXW426OfjztTk55xazXpnjme.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1268&quot; height= &quot;951&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/03/iAC6qJLe4TweMpYZNXW426OfjztTk55xazXpnjme.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256896&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On October 24, 2023, workers were handling the fertilizer shipped in the Yinlian Potted Flower Market. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern Weekend reporter Li Gui/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Core functions are still related to land&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The Ministry of Natural Resources interviews the person in charge of the prefectural and municipal governments, which is related to the inspection of natural resources. This is one of the forms of administrative supervision of lower-level governments by higher-level governments. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The National Land Inspectorate is the predecessor of the National Natural Resources Inspectorate. In order to curb land violations and implement farmland protection, the State Council formally introduced a land inspection system in 2006. The main inspection targets are provinces, autonomous regions, municipalities directly under the Central Government, and municipal governments under separate state planning. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In March 2018, the Ministry of Natural Resources was established. &quot;With the transformation of natural resource management functions and in order to adapt to the needs of natural resource management,&quot; the National Land Inspectorate was transformed into the National Natural Resources Inspectorate. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In June 2019, the General Office of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the General Office of the State Council issued the &quot;Regulations on the Central Ecological and Environmental Protection Supervision&quot;, which clarified the institutional composition, procedural specifications, and procedures of the central ecological and environmental protection supervision in the form of intra-party regulations. In terms of authority and responsibilities, a two-level inspection system at the central and provincial levels has also been established. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the view of Chen Haisong, a professor at the Institute of Environmental Law of Wuhan University, even though the Ministry of Natural Resources has integrated the functions of multiple departments, land-related functions are still the core. “The core of natural resources is land resources,” Chen Haisong said. Therefore, natural resource inspections should focus on the most mature land inspection business and continue to develop in depth. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Implementation Regulations of the Land Management Law&quot; that came into effect on September 1, 2021 clarified the scope and working methods of natural resource inspection for the first time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The regulations stipulate that the national natural resources inspection agency shall, according to the authorization, monitor the protection of cultivated land, the economical and intensive use of land, and the preparation and implementation of land spatial planning by the people&#39;s governments of provinces (autonomous regions, municipalities directly under the Central Government) and the people&#39;s governments of cities determined by the State Council. Supervise the implementation of major national decisions on land management, the implementation of land management laws and administrative regulations, and other land use and land management situations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The national natural resources inspection agency may also interview the relevant person in charge of the local people&#39;s government under supervision, and may make recommendations to the supervisory authority, appointment and dismissal authority and other relevant authorities in accordance with the law on holding the relevant responsible persons accountable. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Unlike this time when nine city (prefecture) governors were called to Beijing for interviews, most of the interviews conducted by the national natural resources inspection agency were conducted locally. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From October to November 2022, the national natural resources inspection agency conducted on-site inspections of cultivated land protection and mineral resources in 31 provinces (autonomous regions, municipalities directly under the Central Government) and the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, and discovered some illegal and illegal issues . In response to the outstanding problems discovered by the inspectors, with the authorization of the National Natural Resources Chief Inspector, the national natural resources inspection agency stationed in the local area conducted interviews with some municipal governments that had serious violations of laws and regulations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among them, the Chengdu Bureau interviewed Dali, Yunnan, the Beijing Bureau interviewed Xingtai, Hebei, and Jinzhong, Shanxi, the Nanjing Bureau interviewed Jiujiang, Jiangxi, and the Guangzhou Bureau interviewed Qingyuan, Guangdong, and Nanning, Guangxi. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Chen Haisong’s view, the profound meaning of this interview with the main person in charge of the local government in Beijing is still related to food security. “For a long time to come, the protection of cultivated land and food security will be very important. The problem&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the interview, Chen Chenzhao, the full-time deputy chief inspector of national natural resources, said: &quot;The task of protecting cultivated land has not been eased, but has become more difficult. Resolute and powerful measures must be taken to continue to strengthen the protection of cultivated land. Firmly hold on to the red line of 1.8 billion acres of cultivated land.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 03 Nov 2023 19:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[教育部：中小学校要确保学生课间正常活动]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259903]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-03 18:11:13&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Recently, the problem of &quot;restraint for 10 minutes between classes&quot; among primary and secondary school students in some places has attracted widespread attention from the society.

The Ministry of Education attaches great importance to students&#39; recess. The &quot;School Protection Regulations for Minors&quot; (Ministry of Education Order No. 50), which will be implemented on September 1, 2021, clearly states that legitimate exchanges between students during recess and other non-teaching time are not allowed. Unnecessary restrictions are placed on the freedom of speech and behavior such as games, activities outside the classroom, etc. In actual work, primary and secondary schools are required to arrange 30 minutes of physical activities between classes every day, and students should be arranged to go out of the classroom for appropriate activities and relaxation during each class break. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The responsible comrade pointed out that the Ministry of Education will further urge local governments and schools to strictly implement relevant national regulations, follow the laws of education and the laws of students&#39; physical and mental development, and resolutely correct the simple restriction of students on the grounds of &quot;ensuring student safety&quot; Necessary recess breaks and activities will be implemented; localities and schools will be guided to scientifically implement management and safety precautions, strengthen inspections of outdoor facilities and personnel on duty, strengthen students’ safety knowledge education, minimize the risk of safety accidents, and make children happy Activities with confidence. At the same time, schools will be required to work closely with home-school communities, strive for parents&#39; understanding and social support, and work together to ensure students&#39; normal activities during class and promote students&#39; healthy growth and all-round development. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 03 Nov 2023 18:55:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[安徽武校投毒致7死案开庭：“26年了，总算对弟弟有个交代”]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259861]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-03 18:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;After the incident, seven families of the deceased took a group photo.

Symptoms such as vomiting and convulsions occurred. Seven students, including Qian Min and Yang Changwei, died due to ineffective rescue efforts. An investigation by the public security agency found that they were all poisoned by poisonous 424 ingredients. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Twenty-six years later, on October 29, 2023, the Ma&#39;anshan City Public Security Bureau held a briefing meeting on the collective poisoning case at the North and South Shaolin Martial Arts Schools in Hexian County, and announced the arrest of two suspects in the case, Fu Moujie and Zhu A certain forest. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At 9:00 in the morning on November 1, the case was heard in Maanshan Intermediate Court.

So he joined the army, &quot;he served for less than two years, and finally brought back an urn.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“The blow was too big and I couldn’t bear it.” 62-year-old Qian Farong still uses Qian Min’s photo as a WeChat avatar.

Photo provided by the interviewee&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But Qian Farong and his wife did not expect that the murderer was Fu Moujie, a coach who taught at the martial arts school. &quot;The coach surnamed Fu likes my son the most. They live in the same room. Every time we go to see my son, we have to thank him.&quot; Diao Shanyun said that his son often talks about how good Fu is, &quot;Why does he not like my son?&quot; My son lived in the same room with him. I heard from my son that Teacher Fu was very good and had a good character. How could he do this?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The indictment from the Ma&#39;anshan City Procuratorate shows that this case The poisoning case originated from a competition between two martial arts gyms. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Around 1994, the defendants Zhu Moulin and Peng Mouwei ran the He County Shaolin Martial Arts Gym in Buji Town, Wujiang Town, He County, with Zhu Moulin as the director and Peng Mouwei as the head coach. During the business process, the two had conflicts. Peng Mouwei left the martial arts hall and reopened Hexian North and South Shaolin Martial Arts School in Xibu Town, taking most of the teachers and students with him. Zhu Moulin therefore harbored a grudge against Peng Mouwei. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In August 1996, the defendant Fu Moujie went to teach at the North and South Shaolin Martial Arts School in He County run by Peng Mouwei. While teaching, he gradually became dissatisfied with Peng Mouwei due to trivial matters. Zhu Moulin and Fu Mojie met after being introduced by others. During the process of getting along, they both expressed their dissatisfaction with Peng Mouwei, so they decided to retaliate against Peng Mouwei together and bring down Peng Mouwei&#39;s martial arts school. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In June of the following year, Fu Jie and Zhu Moulin discussed and decided to use poisoning to retaliate against Peng Mouwei. After Fu Jie implemented it, Zhu Moulin paid Fu Jie 50,000 yuan. Lin paid a certain order 500 yuan on the spot. At the end of the month, Fu Moujie resigned from the martial arts school and returned to his hometown in Jianli, Hubei Province to buy two packs of rat poison. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the night before the incident, on the evening of June 29, Fu Moujie ran from the south of the North and South Shaolin Martial Arts School in He County to the kitchen of the martial arts school, and put two packets of rat poison in a red plastic basin on the table on the south side of the kitchen. After mixing the salted cowpeas inside, he fled from the original road and left Hexian County. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At about 7 o&#39;clock the next morning, more than 130 teachers and students in the martial arts school developed vomiting, convulsions and other symptoms after eating breakfast. Yang Changwei, Wang Jun, Xing Tao, Liu Wenbao, Tian Dan, Tang Yuye, Qian Min, etc. 7 students died. During the on-site investigation, items such as salted cowpeas and gauze masks were extracted, and the ingredients of Toxin 424 were detected. In addition, the causes of death of 7 students were identified. After identification, the 7 students died of 424 rat poison poisoning. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But Fu Mojie and Zhu Moulin were missing, and it was difficult for the police to solve the case for a while. The Ma&#39;anshan Municipal Public Security Bureau introduced at the briefing meeting that after the case occurred, the public security agency set up a task force to conduct visits and investigations around the crime scene and analyzed that Fu Moujie and Zhu Moulin were suspected of committing major crimes. On July 14, 1997, the public security organs listed Fu Jie and Zhu Moulin as fugitives on the Internet, offered a reward for their arrest, and continued to pursue them. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;Photo of Fu Moujie playing with students.

What do you think we should do?” Yang Xiping received the news from her neighbor half a month after the incident. When she returned home, she saw a coffin in the yard. She remembered clearly, &quot;The moment I knelt on the ground, I saw that my father&#39;s hair was all white and he was so thin.&quot; It doesn’t even look like it anymore.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Diao Shanyun still can’t figure out why his son was poisoned to death by his favorite coach. After the couple buried their son, they bought a tombstone with the words: &quot;My beloved son Qian Min, unfortunately died unjustly in the June 30 massacre in 1997.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Until the second half of 2022, this case that had been silent for many years There was a breakthrough in the poisoning case. The task force discovered traces of Zhu Moulin in Guizhou and basically locked his hiding place in early 2023. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In early May 2023, the police in Jinjiang, Fujian Province used big data analysis and found that a man working in a tannery factory had similar physical characteristics to the suspect Fu Moujie. After repeated comparisons and confirmations by the police in the two places, they immediately Keep it under control. The task force rushed to Jinjiang, Fujian Province on the evening of May 6. After preliminary interrogation, Fu Moujie explained the crime to the public security organs. On May 9, Fu Moujie was escorted back to He County. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time as Fu Moujie was captured, in the early morning of May 7, the task force went to Guiyang City, Guizhou Province. With the assistance of the local police, Zhu Moulin, who had concealed his identity and opened a local bottled water production company, was arrested at the factory. Successfully captured. When he saw the police who came to arrest him, Zhu Moulin froze in place and was surprised. He didn&#39;t expect that the police would come to his door after so long. In the early morning of May 8, Zhu Moulin was escorted back to He County. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In October 2023, at the press briefing on the martial arts school poisoning case, the Maanshan City Public Security Bureau task force introduced: After interrogation, Fu Moujie confessed that after committing the crime, he had been hiding in Tibet with no fixed residence. He moved to Xinyu City in Jiangxi Province, Dehua County in Fujian Province, Putian City, Jinjiang City and other places to make a living by doing odd jobs. Because he was afraid that his identity would be exposed and investigated by the public security organs, he did not dare to register his identity information, and did not dare to get vaccinated or take nucleic acid tests during the epidemic. When applying for a job, I never choose a position or negotiate salary, just to have a place to hide. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to Zhu Moulin&#39;s account, in order to avoid attacks by the public security organs, he concealed his true identity and wandered alone during his absconding period. He first hid in Poyang County, Jiangxi Province for 2 years, and then moved to Hangzhou City, Zhejiang Province to work. When I opened a bottled water production company in Shangrao City, Jiangxi Province, and Guiyang City, Guizhou Province, I have been living a life of fear for so many years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;In June, my dad received a notice saying that the murderer had been found, and I came back immediately.&quot; Yang Xiping said that when he heard that the murderer had been found, both he and his father cried on the phone. &quot;Finally, I can give him some help.&quot; My brother gave me the explanation.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yang Xi often thinks that if his brother is still here, this family must be different. She asked her sisters not to marry far away, &quot;because there is no younger brother and my mother is not in good health.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yang Xiping said that his mother became seriously ill due to the loss of his son, and his father suffered a neurasthenia after suffering a shock. As a result, his third sister no longer wanted to study. &quot;My father often couldn&#39;t find anyone at night. He would either go to his brother&#39;s grave and cry, or he would go to the river or the bricks. We would search everywhere.&quot; Yang&#39;s father has been blaming himself for hurting his son and can&#39;t get out. Because it was he who sent his youngest son to an expensive martial arts school despite his family&#39;s objections. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the evening of October 31, Yang Xiping rushed to He County with his family to prepare for the court session the next day. She hoped that Fu and Zhu would be punished as they deserved. &quot;If nothing happens to my brother, he will be 37 years old this year and it&#39;s time to start a family.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 03 Nov 2023 18:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[专访俄专家安德烈·科尔图诺夫：俄乌冲突越早结束，对大家都越好]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259859]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-03 17:30:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;获取更多RSS：&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 03 Nov 2023 17:55:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[今秋的北方，为何又热又霾？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259897]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-03 17:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/ image/23/11/03/bc2b2a112d.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;702&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/ 03/bc2b2a112d.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256941&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: left;&quot;>;On the morning of November 1, 2023, People&#39;s Park, Luancheng District, Shijiazhuang City , citizens wearing masks went for morning exercises in the haze.

On November 3, with the arrival of cold air, diffusion conditions gradually improved, and pollution was gradually cleared from north to south. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;High temperatures have exceeded 40℃ for many days in a row in summer. At the end of October, temperatures in Beijing, Tianjin, Shandong and other places rarely warmed up again. The highest temperatures in Zhengzhou City, Henan Province even reached 30℃ on November 1st and 2nd. and 29℃. In early November in Beijing, there were still many people wearing short sleeves and shorts on the streets at noon. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region and surrounding cities are plunged into smog. According to statistics from the National Joint Center for Atmospheric Pollution Prevention and Control, as of October 30, 20 cities in the region have initiated heavy pollution weather warnings. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“The pollution processes that have occurred in North China in the past two days once again remind us that China still has a long way to go to fundamentally improve air pollution.” He Kebin, academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering and director of the Carbon Neutrality Research Institute of Tsinghua University, said in the speech It was stated at the 2023 Annual Meeting of the China Clean Air Policy Partnership held in Beijing on November 1. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Not only is it affected by meteorological conditions, air pollution is also inextricably linked to global climate change. Zhu Tong, academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and professor of the School of Environmental Science and Engineering at Peking University, said at the above meeting that as pollutants emitted from anthropogenic sources decrease, climate warming will also aggravate air pollution, such as smoke and dust brought by forest wildfires, near-ground The aggravation and generation of ozone pollution will further affect human health. Solving related basic scientific problems is the challenge and focus in the future. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The overall situation is good, and the performance of key areas is average&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Starting from late October, the haze in the north began to spread. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I just came back from Hebei very late yesterday.

Among the 168 key cities, the number of cities with PM&lt;sub>;2.5&lt;/sub>; concentrations rising instead of falling has increased from 24 in 2021 to 50. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Cold air activity is weak&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Meteorological conditions are the external cause of this round of polluted weather. Li Pei said that although my country&#39;s air pollution control has achieved certain results, the results are not yet stable. Generally speaking, it has not yet gotten rid of meteorological influences. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The expert team of the National Joint Center for Atmospheric Pollution Prevention and Control analyzed that since October 22, the cold air activity in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei and surrounding areas has been weak, and the surface temperature and relative humidity of the lower atmosphere have been higher than normal, which is easy to Form regional pollution. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to popular science from the China Meteorological Administration, fog and haze are more likely to occur in autumn and winter, which are related to calm weather. The &quot;quiet&quot; in static and stable weather means that the wind speed in the horizontal direction is small, and &quot;stable&quot; means that the atmospheric stratification in the vertical direction is relatively stable, and there is little vertical exchange between the lower atmosphere and the middle atmosphere. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The formation of stable weather is related to factors such as topography and circulation. Special terrains such as mountains, hills, and basins can hinder the circulation of air. The Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region is affected by the &quot;dustpan-shaped&quot; terrain of high in the northwest and low in the southeast. Pollutants are easy to accumulate in front of the Taihang Mountains and Yanshan Mountains. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Under the circulation factor, if there is a temperature inversion in the atmospheric stratification (the lower layer is cold and the upper layer is warm), heavier air will be in the lower layer and lighter air will be in the upper layer. The atmospheric structure is stable and vertically diffused. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Air quality is not only affected by short-term meteorological conditions, but also related to long-term climate change. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to Fang Chong, chief forecaster of the Central Meteorological Observatory, generally speaking, mid-to-late October has entered the active period of cold air, but in 2023 the cold air will be significantly weaker and the temperature will be significantly higher. Currently, a total of 237 national-level weather stations have broken the historical extreme value of the highest temperature in late October, which is a rare situation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;In 2023, Canada&#39;s forest fires had a serious impact on New York&#39;s air quality. At a time when New Yorkers may have forgotten what air pollution is, the wildfires reminded them that climate change will bring extraordinary consequences. Serious air pollution will cause harm to human health.&quot; Zhu Tong said at the meeting that in addition to cases of wildfires, future climate change will also bring more frequent extreme climate events such as extreme high temperatures, droughts, and sandstorms. The harm caused will also be multiplied. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/03/5354fa2010.

Therefore, when air pollution occurs, it may also represent an increase in greenhouse gas emissions; secondly, Many components of PM&lt;sub>;2.5&lt;/sub>; will affect atmospheric radiation, thereby affecting the energy balance and causing climate change. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Chi Qianyuan said that aerosol particles may also participate in the formation of clouds and rain, thereby affecting the weather system and climate conditions; on the other hand, climate change itself may lead to increased air pollution, such as rising temperatures may cause Increases in ozone concentration, such as changes in atmospheric circulation patterns, may affect atmospheric stability and diffusion conditions, leading to changes in PM&lt;sub>;2.5&lt;/sub>; concentrations. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Pollution reduction and carbon reduction synergies&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;He Kebin said that since 2013, the &quot;Ten Measures for Atmosphere&quot; have &quot;won the battle to defend the blue sky&quot;. , emissions of air pollutants have declined, but the annual emission reduction range has gradually narrowed. This reflects the marginal effect of air pollution prevention and control. “All the good things, the big profits, and the big emission reduction potentials have been done.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The internal cause of this round of pollution in Beijing, Tianjin, Hebei and surrounding areas is still man-made emissions. A team of experts from the National Joint Center for Atmospheric Pollution Prevention and Control explained that emissions from motor vehicles, industrial furnaces, etc. are the main sources of PM&lt;sub>;2.5&lt;/sub>; pollution in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei and surrounding areas, and straw burning has a negative impact on local PM&lt;sub>; 2.5&lt;/sub>;Pollution contributes prominently. The activity level of industrial enterprises, heavy trucks and the number of straw fire points in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei and surrounding areas increased month-on-month, and pollution emissions showed an increasing trend. In terms of industrial sources, since late October, regional industrial electricity consumption has increased by about 5% compared with early and mid-October; in terms of mobile sources, the traffic volume of heavy trucks in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei and surrounding areas is at a high level since autumn and winter, which is higher than that in October. The early to mid-term prices were about 14% higher. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Air pollution control needs to find new impetus, and the synergy of pollution reduction and carbon reduction is an important starting point. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“After carbon peaks in 2030, the role of end-of-pipe governance will become smaller and smaller, and it will gradually shift to the adjustment and reduction of the four major structures (energy structure, industrial structure, transportation structure, and land use structure). Pollution reduction and carbon reduction will create synergies.&quot; He Kebin believes that whether it is for economic development or improving air quality, carbon reduction is the recent pressure and the driving force for the future. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In June 2022, the Ministry of Ecology and Environment, the National Development and Reform Commission and other ministries and commissions jointly issued the &quot;Pollution Reduction and Carbon Reduction Synergy and Efficiency Implementation Plan&quot;, stating that &quot;collaboratively promote pollution reduction and carbon reduction to achieve integrated planning and Integrated deployment, integrated promotion, and integrated assessment.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yan Gang, deputy director of the Environmental Planning Institute of the Ministry of Ecology and Environment, introduced at the meeting that from the perspective of air pollutants and carbon emissions, two-thirds of cities have not achieved synergy during the &quot;Thirteenth Five-Year Plan&quot; period. Improvement; from an industry perspective, although pollutant emissions in most industries are currently showing a significant downward trend, carbon emissions are still growing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yan Gang said that collaborative governance of pollution reduction and carbon reduction is not like other pollution control work in the past. There is a lot of international experience to draw from. At present, my country&#39;s pollution reduction and carbon reduction collaborative efficiency work faces some challenges. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, there is still a lack of support in the theoretical system, and research on the characterization of pollution emissions should be strengthened to identify the homology and heterogeneity of emissions; in terms of regulation, target allocation, smart regulation, governance technology, etc. still need to be A series of studies will be carried out; relevant policies also need to be further coordinated. The other side of challenges also means opportunities. If we respond proactively, air pollution control and carbon emission control can achieve a win-win situation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 03 Nov 2023 17:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[清剿电诈还是军阀混战？缅北果敢到底怎么了？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259885]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-03 16:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 11/03/aLb8TNP0traIg28E2TC5ktDQUzChTKWZqcnqnO5f.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/03/aLb8TNP0traIg28E2TC5ktDQUzChTK WZqcnqnO5f. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256881&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On October 28, 2023, in northern Shan State, Myanmar, a missile struck from a Military base launch&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;October 27, 2023, Myanmar in Lashio, Gwei and other places in northern Myanmar Government military positions were attacked by armed forces and fierce fighting broke out.

There are far fewer Chinese people traveling to Myanmar than to neighboring Southeast Asian countries such as Thailand, Vietnam or Cambodia. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, in the past two years, Myanmar has gained notoriety in our country&#39;s public opinion due to telecom fraud and &quot;Gayaozi&quot; (illegal organ harvesting and trade). With the dissemination of relevant social media information and film and television works, more and more Chinese people have learned that the northern region of Myanmar adjacent to Yunnan is an area where telecommunications fraud and criminal gang activities are rampant, and the local government is helpless and even complicit in this. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the day when the conflict in northern Myanmar broke out, the Kokang Alliance Army&#39;s social media immediately released a statement titled &quot;Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army, Ta&#39;ang National Liberation Army, and Arakan Army &quot;10.27&quot; Action Statement.&quot; mentioned, &quot;We will eradicate telecommunications fraud, fraud dens and their protective umbrellas across the country, including the China-Myanmar border areas. The three coalition forces decided to jointly carry out this military operation.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This statement After the release, the propaganda of these three ethnic and local armed forces continued to contain content about destroying telecom fraud gangs and saving trapped compatriots. Among them, the Kokang Allied Forces even released a pre-war mobilization video of a unit of the Allied Forces on the short video social platform. The brigade commander who issued the mobilization order said in a solemn tone: Our mission is to eradicate the electronic fraud group, eliminate drugs, and rescue our compatriots. no confidence! &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Then the soldiers in uniform shouted in unison: Yes! have! have! &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;They are not just a bunch of people who shout loud slogans. When it comes to fighting, the Kokang Allied Forces have always been good at attacking. As early as the Kokang War in 2015, the Allied Forces launched an attack under the eyes of the Myanmar government forces. Not only did the vanguard troops enter Lao Cai, the capital of the Kokang region, on the day the war started, but they also later sniped and killed a Myanmar Army deputy from a distance behind enemy lines. brigadier. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the last moment of the Kokang War that year, the Kokang Allied Forces defended the Nantianmen Highlands at an altitude of more than 2,000 meters in the north of Lao Cai for two months despite the artillery fire and aircraft bombings of the Burmese army. In the end, the Burmese army launched a general offensive. , none of the more than 20 defenders who held on to the end surrendered and all died in the battle. Their fighting will shocked even the opponent Burmese army. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the conflict on October 27, the Kokang Allied Forces performed even more rapidly. Within just a few days of the war, they quickly occupied the Qingshui River area adjacent to Lao Cai and an important port with China. , captured more than 60 Burmese army strongholds, successfully relied on light infantry to destroy 6 armored vehicles, and completely wiped out the Burmese airborne special forces who came to provide parachute support. Under the rapid offensive of the Allied Forces, a battalion of Myanmar government officers and soldiers organized and surrendered. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Arakan Army and the Ta’ang National Liberation Army, which cooperated with the Kokang Allied Forces, fought on the outside. The Ta’ang Army not only attacked Denni Town, but also successfully destroyed the nearby Nanda River Bridge to prevent the Burmese army from using the road to reinforce the Kokang. area. The Arakan Army and the Ta&#39;ang Army attacked the Lashio area and once shelled the most important Lashio Airport in northern Myanmar, causing the grounding of civil aviation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Judging from the current situation, the Burmese military strongholds outside Lao Cai, the capital of Kokang, have basically been cleared. The attack and defense of Lao Cai will probably begin soon. Once the Kokang Allied Forces successfully regain control of Lao Cai Right, then this battle can basically be declared a victory. Compared with the Kokang war in 2015, the current Kokang Allied Forces are closer to their goal, which is to retake Lao Cai and regain control of the Kokang area. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the political narrative of the ethnic local armed forces in northern Myanmar, they are the positive heroes, and there are also evil villains accordingly. The villains this time are the four Guogan families. The four major families are the Bai family represented by Bai Chengcheng, the Wei family of Wei Chaoren, the Ming family of Ming Xuechang, and the Liu family of Liu Abao. The representatives of these four families are all powerful figures in the Kokang area and are the mortal enemies of the Kokang Allied Forces. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From the perspective of the anti-telecom fraud narrative, the four major families are well-deserved as the villains. The companies of these four families have been operating telecom fraud businesses under the name of entrepreneurial parks for many years. , thus gaining a lot of wealth. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In real international politics or regional disputes, the image of justice is part of the application of power. War is a continuation of politics, and politics often requires the blessing of morality. Destroying telecom fraud to save compatriots is not necessarily just talk. For the Kokang Allied Forces, as long as they successfully recover Kokang and completely eliminate the disgusting industry of telecom fraud, it is not a problem. After all, this is not their source of income. However, if it is said that the Kokang Allied Forces are only going to war to eradicate telecommunications fraud, that is not consistent with the facts. After all, this is not the first war between the Kokang Allied Forces and the four major Kokang families. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Early on August 8, 2009, before northern Myanmar became a den of electronic fraud, Bai Suocheng, one of the later leaders of the four major families and deputy commander of the Kokang Alliance Army at the time, joined forces with the Myanmar army and other Three major families launched a coup and drove Peng Jiasheng, the first leader of the Kokang Alliance Army, out of the Kokang area. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2015, after six years of dormancy, the Kokang Allied Forces launched a counterattack against the government forces in the Kokang region during the Spring Festival. At that time, the Kokang Allied Forces launched the attack in the name of returning home for the New Year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Therefore, not only was the last war not successful militarily, but it also did not have a high enough voice politically. It was even easily regarded by bystanders as a battle between warlords and interest groups. This time, the Kokang Allied Forces have grown for more than eight years. Their military, political, and propaganda capabilities are far better than before, and the results are likely to be very different. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, regardless of whether it is counter-terrorism or not, for the Kokang Allied Forces, being able to fight back their hometown of Kokang and regain control of the old street is the basis for their survival. The leader of the previous generation, Peng Jiasheng, died of illness in February 2022. The current Kokang Allied Forces, under the leadership of the current commander Peng Deren (Peng Jiasheng’s eldest son), has left his homeland to fight guerrillas for many years. But this is not a long-term solution. Without the support of their hometown and a solid base, it will be difficult for the team to develop and grow. Therefore, the military conflict that broke out on October 27, 2023, is equivalent to a battle for survival for the Kokang Allied Forces. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/03/njM3JUYhKJyfESN1197AS2088mFAwDbyciHIGs5A.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/03/njM3JUYhKJyfESN1197AS2088mFAwDbyciHIGs5A.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256882&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On January 4, 2023, in Naypyitaw, Myanmar, Chairman of the National Governing Council of Myanmar Min Aung Hlaing attended the military parade&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China /Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Looking at the Kokang from across Myanmar&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In the eyes of those familiar with the background of the war in northern Myanmar, the Kokang Allied Forces this time It is expected to be invincible on the battlefield, because as early as 2021, an enemy far more deadly than the ethnic local armed forces in northern Myanmar appeared in Myanmar. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On February 1, 2021, Myanmar political leader Aung San Suu Kyi was arrested by the Myanmar military at her home and was eventually sentenced to 33 years in prison. For Aung San Suu Kyi, who was already 78 years old at the time, this was tantamount to a life sentence. On the day Aung San Suu Kyi was arrested, large-scale street protests broke out across Myanmar. In the end, large-scale clashes broke out between demonstrators and military police. Many Western countries condemned the Myanmar military government and announced the restoration of comprehensive sanctions on Myanmar. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, Aung San Suu Kyi’s political party, the National League for Democracy (NLD), was also banned by the military government. This series of actions basically announced the complete break between the Myanmar military government and the National League for Democracy. This caused the core political elites of the NLD and their supporters to completely cut off the possibility of parliamentary politics. The military government&#39;s violent suppression of demonstrations also caused Aung San Suu Kyi&#39;s supporters believed that the only way to fight against the military government was through force, so they announced the establishment of the National Unity Government of the Republic of the Union of Myanmar (Burmese abbreviation NUG). Its political proposition is to overthrow the military government through force and regain power. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The NUG can be regarded as the NLD&#39;s government-in-exile, which announced the establishment of a military organization in 2021: the People&#39;s Defense Forces (PDF in Burmese). On September 7, 2021, NUG announced the launch of a &quot;people&#39;s defense war&quot; against the military government and called on citizens across Myanmar to resist the military government. For the Myanmar military government, this is undoubtedly a greater threat than the local ethnic armed forces in northern Myanmar. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since independence after World War II, Myanmar’s civil war has never stopped, but the armed forces of NUG PDF are different from the enemies faced by the previous Myanmar government forces. In past civil wars, the main enemies the Myanmar Army faced were ethnic minority armed forces in border areas, such as northern Myanmar and the Golden Triangle. Such armed forces may be powerful, such as the United Wa State Army, which has heavy equipment including anti-aircraft missiles and armed helicopters, or the Kachin Independence Army, which has sophisticated tactics and well-trained training. However, the characteristic of this type of army is that it is concentrated in areas where its ethnic groups are concentrated, and their political demands are only to maintain the independence and territory of their own ethnic groups. Therefore, the fighting between the Myanmar government army and these local ethnic armed forces is mainly concentrated in the northern region of Myanmar, which is the so-called Upper Myanmar. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Myanmar, also known as Lower Myanmar, is mainly dominated by the Bamar people. The Bamar people account for up to 68% of the population of Myanmar and are the absolute majority of the population. It is difficult for local armed forces of ethnic groups in northern Myanmar to penetrate Entered Burma to fight. Politically, ethnic local armed forces have no such demands. The core members of the NUG are themselves Bamar political elites, and their main area of ​​activity happens to be in Lower Myanmar. Especially after the NUG established the armed forces PDF, the core members were sent to the Kachin and other ethnic local armed regimes to learn how to fight, and at the same time, they used Its underground network in lower Burmese society continues to carry out propaganda and mobilization. A large number of soldiers and officers with combat experience were absorbed into PDF. In recent years, the Myanmar government military academies have not only had difficulty recruiting students, but there have even been incidents of graduates taking their equipment and defecting to PDF. So far, at least 16,000 Myanmar military and police personnel have defected and joined PDF. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to poaching and gathering intelligence, PDF began to engage in guerrilla warfare with the Burmese army in lower Myanmar, and its organized combat units even appeared near Myanmar&#39;s capital, Naypyitaw, and the largest city, Yangon. In May 2023, the NUG announced the establishment of about 300 battalions and columns, banned the government agencies of the military junta in 250 towns and villages in Lower Myanmar, and established its own regime. In June 2023, NUG announced the formation of the 5101st Battalion, which was actually established in the Yangon area. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although the PDF has not had any decent results since its establishment, and has not successfully annihilated any Burmese army troops, its direct threat to the political and economic center of Burma in Lower Burma has forced the Burmese government forces to allocate Spend a lot of resources to defend against PDF sneak attacks. The NUG&#39;s intelligence and mobilization capabilities have also greatly weakened the Myanmar military government&#39;s ability to control Lower Myanmar. The reason why the PDF is considered more deadly than any ethnic local armed forces is because their military goal is not to occupy territory or support themselves with troops, but to completely destroy the Myanmar military government and regain power. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If we look back at the Kokang conflict in 2015, we will find that the Myanmar government army could easily mobilize several brigades from Lower Myanmar to assist Kokang, while the air force could take off directly from surrounding airports to concentrate its forces. Attack the Kokang Allied Forces&#39; positions. However, after the conflict broke out this time, the intensity and equipment level of government forces in mobilizing reinforcements were far lower than last time, and even air support was quite limited. The fundamental reason is that the mobile forces at the hands of the Myanmar military government are already stretched thin. If a large number of troops are deployed to support Kokang, the PDFs around Yangon and Naypyitaw will definitely take advantage of the situation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/03/4lWn6pGSgtdzDnCKmw06nWYn9rgCT1PcPrrxBIvb.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/03/4lWn6pGSgtdzDnCKmw06nWYn9rgCT1PcPrrxBIvb.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256883&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On March 8, 2023, in Shan State, Myanmar, the Ta&#39;ang National Liberation Army conducted military training&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span >;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Why is courage so important? &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;For the Kokang Allied Forces, Kokang is of course crucial, because that is the only goal of this army at the moment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For the four major families of Kokang, Kokang is their political capital and a treasure trove of wealth. Losing Kokang means losing everything that two generations have worked hard for for decades. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For the military government, Kokang is also crucial. The reason why the leader of the military government, General Min Aung Hlaing, stands out among many generals is because he successfully occupied Kokang and expelled Peng Jiasheng’s troops in 2009, making him He gained unprecedented prestige in the military and became the number one figure among the new generation of generals. Although Kokang is only the first special zone in Shan State with a permanent population of 140,000 and an area of ​​only 2,000 square kilometers, if it fails, the chain effect will be fatal. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Therefore, from a political point of view, the Myanmar government forces will not give up Kokang easily, and will naturally try their best to support the local armed forces in Kokang to prevent the Kokang Allied Forces from succeeding in their counterattack. Therefore, although the Kokang Allied Forces made good progress in the early stage, it was still difficult to launch an actual offensive to retake Lao Cai. The price they are willing to pay to aid Kokang is the key to whether the Myanmar military government and the four major families can hold on to Kokang. If the level of military investment in the last Kokang conflict can be maintained, it may still be difficult for the Kokang Allied Forces to retake Lao Cai. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 03 Nov 2023 16:25:03 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
