On the way, he talked about Guinan School, which is located at the foot of Wugui Mountain in Zhongshan City. The implication is that this private primary and secondary school has an average admission rate. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I have heard too many of the same stories. Designer and school art group teacher Zhang Yaoren could only smile helplessly. What is good and what is bad? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Achievements&quot; are always the only yardstick for most people. Zhang Yaoren didn’t think so. He is thin, in his fifties, and has been at Guinan School for more than five years. Old P, as people like to call him, is from Henan. He has been in Guangdong for more than thirty years. He settled in nearby Qixi Village a few years ago. He and Shi Lei, the principal of Guinan School, hit it off on this topic: &quot;Do children in rural areas need... Need aesthetic education?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/16/vMCE1SIISojaA1pyEdXttSCFwmE6MrnjJsd4NQjL.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 960&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/16/vMCE1SIISojaA1pyEdXttSCFwmE6MrnjJsd4NQjL.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250958&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Works by Guinan School students. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of interviewee)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Independent artist and curator Guan Yong is in his forties, has a tall figure and likes to wear Straw sandals. He has been engaged in art education since he was nineteen years old, working in kindergartens, primary schools, and art galleries in Zhuhai, Guangzhou, Macau and other places. Later, he also participated in this miniature rural aesthetic education experiment as an art director. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Initially, Guinan School had more than 40 classes, more than 1,700 students, and 3 art teachers, but there was no art classroom. In July 2018, Guinan School converted six classrooms on the first floor into art classrooms. Now, the school has eight full-time art teachers, four studios and a reading room. The teaching content involves traditional Chinese painting, printmaking, pottery, paper-cutting, etc. Guinan&#39;s campus also has a miniature art gallery that displays students&#39; works. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When visiting this place, Southern Weekend reporters were surprised by the art works hidden on campus. These works are displayed all over the campus. A large number of clay sculptures are dried on the ground, prints are posted on the walls, installation art is hung in the corridors, and handmade works are posted under the eaves. These works are quite childish, and the largest number are clay sculptures, including cups, plates, bottles, jars, and various clay figures with strange shapes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/16/Up3LZQx8CNfkgURkqUALPuYpCgqb4Tv173RGEIYA.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/16/Up3LZQx8CNfkgURkqUALPuYpCgqb4Tv173RGEIYA.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250959&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Student art works in the corridor of the teaching building of Guinan School. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of interviewee)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the comprehensive studio, weaving, sewing, embroidery and other handicrafts are completed here; folk crafts The studio is for students; the folk art room is filled with students’ prints, paper-cuts, etc.; in the comprehensive painting studio, you can see Chinese paintings, watercolors, oil paintings and other works by students. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/16/K4RhNWazPNxMQUDqRo9O4X3j0zIZBlSXxoWguIr8.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;720&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/16/K4RhNWazPNxMQUDqRo9O4X3j0zIZBlSXxoWguIr8.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250963&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Student prints from Guinan School. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern Weekend reporter Zhang Rui/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If you travel through the countryside, you can also see the works of students. &quot;Children&#39;s things are natural things.&quot; Zhang Yaoren pointed to the student works along the country road and said, &quot;(In the past) many paintings on the walls were relatively stiff.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In August 2023, Guan Yong and others started a rural teacher program to provide teaching support to front-line teachers from rural areas and plan to complete the training of one thousand teachers within two years. Zhang Yaoren said: &quot;We do the Thousand Talents Plan precisely because we believe that (aesthetic education) is the most important thing.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;If you have never done carpentry, you will do carpentry, and if you have never played in mud, you will play in mud.&quot;&lt;/h4 >; &lt;p>;Local children mostly choose to go to public schools in towns. The students recruited by Guinan School are basically the children of migrant workers. Most of these students come from Sichuan, Hunan, Anhui and other places. Their parents left their hometown and came to the Pearl River Delta. While the students are in class, their parents sell things at nearby markets, work in factories, and do odd jobs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhang Yaoren recalled to Southern Weekend reporters that students would leave every semester. The fathers left the worksite, and the children flew away like birds. Academic performance has nothing to do with art. Zhang Yaoren said that they did not disclose the idea of ​​​​art courses to the parents of the students. He understands the parents’ thinking. Art is useless. It’s better to do more questions: “The parents must have said that my son only scored 85 points in math. Can you not let him attend the 90 minutes of art class? He might get 90 points in the exam. ”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Guan Yong has a point of view. Regarding the curriculum, the art textbooks compiled by the state are always the basis, accounting for 70% of the curriculum. The remaining 30% is carried out by the teaching team for outreach and expansion. The content of the 18 textbooks for grades one to nine was broken up and reconnected with the four studios. As the grades increase, the content offered by each studio becomes deeper. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/16/yPaKd9OGAQgZTSxdq2wI90zCjjZziTskqh66IZUd.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;720&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/16/yPaKd9OGAQgZTSxdq2wI90zCjjZziTskqh66IZUd.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250955&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Gouache painting by Guinan School students. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern Weekend reporter Zhang Rui/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“All the teaching materials were smashed and placed in the studio... The textbooks are relatively thin ,&quot; Zhang Yaoren gave an example, &quot;One class (textbook) says that the mud will be gone, but we asked the first-grade children to work here for four consecutive weeks making mud, and (the students) wanted to make bowls after finishing the cups. I also want to make a vessel with a handle, so that the child will have an understanding of the properties of clay, the complexity of materials, and the complexity of creation.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Improving teachers&#39; aesthetic and teaching abilities is the key . Five years ago, there were only two art teachers in Guinan School, and students would take out A4 paper to sketch in class. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;(Rural Art Teachers) Their professionalism is not deep. How come teachers who graduated from the National Academy of Arts and Central America come to our place? When the professional level of the teachers is not that high, how can Can you improve their level?&quot; Zhang Yaoren told the Southern Weekend reporter, &quot;Teach you how to work. If you have never done carpentry before, do carpentry, and if you have never played with mud, just play with mud.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Guan Yong et al. People prefer to refer to entering the classroom as entering the studio. They believe that art is the vocabulary of the adult world, while children&#39;s basic art education is &quot;enlightenment of students&#39; creativity and self-expression&quot; and is more like &quot;an artistic job&quot;. He rarely talks about art theory. When he encounters a problem, Guan Yong always says &quot;get moving&quot;. What should I do if I don’t have an art foundation? Guan Yong said, then work! As you dry it, you will feel it on your hands. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/16/1EySt6Joa4v1Qfj3z416218QnPl4KnxPxxZ1Z1UV.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/16/1EySt6Joa4v1Qfj3z416218QnPl4KnxPxxZ1Z1UV.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250957&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The art studio of Guinan School. Every time students finish class, they will clean up the studio as required. Zhang Yaoren believes that this is also part of aesthetic education. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of interviewee)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Guinan School does not add additional time for art classes, and of course does not allow preemption of art classes. time, students are required to complete a ninety-minute class once a week. Forty minutes of art class is simply not enough to keep children &quot;enjoyed.&quot; There is always an appreciation session at the beginning of the course. The teacher brings the pictures related to the curriculum to the children to “look at”. In nine years, students can look at tens of thousands of pictures, and these pictures become one of the sources of their aesthetic appreciation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, in the second grade course &quot;Paper Cutting - Transformation&quot;, students need to learn origami, binding, cutting, and collage heads, and watch the works of Huang Yongyu, Komatsu Miu, Han Meilin, etc.; fifth grade The ninety-minute class in the first semester is titled &quot;Color Blow Molding - Vase Flowers&quot;. The teaching content includes engraving outlines and patterns, and the materials viewed include the works of Davids, Van Gogh, Matisse, etc.; In the ninth-grade course &quot;Comprehensive Printmaking - Mask&quot;, students have to learn how to engrave lightness and grayscale, and watch the works of Gu Kaizhi, Wu Daozi, and Zhang Xuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are various equipment in the studio, including expensive printmaking machines, as well as various painting tools, glue guns, saws, etc. According to statistics, there are more than thirty kinds of paper. These materials come from Guinan School Expenditures. Zhang Yaoren said that the school has made great efforts&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/16/Q4vVA4zYwX0QyIXfpOnDVbYEIDsoi3KyR1mlocmq.jpg&quot; border =&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/16/Q4vVA4zYwX0QyIXfpOnDVbYEIDsoi3KyR1mlocmq.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250956&quot; >;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In the art studio of Guinan School, the drawers are filled with papers of various materials. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of interviewee)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, not every school has enough funding for materials. Some materials also come from the land. The art teacher took the students to collect leaves, soil, discarded paper, old clothes, plastic bottles, etc. Every semester, children in Guinan consume tons of soil. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The art teacher became the leader of the main subject&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Zhang Yaoren once visited some rural schools in western Guangdong, and the proportion of left-behind children in these schools accounted for more than 60%. In a central primary school in a certain town, there are only 180 students. In the context of &quot;dismantling sites and merging schools&quot;, data from NetEase Digital shows that in the forty years from 1976 to 2016, 916,000 primary schools disappeared in China, and most of them were rural primary schools. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many art teachers who participated in the training confirmed this statement to Southern Weekend reporters. A rural teacher in Hengyang, Hunan told a Southern Weekend reporter with sadness that her rural primary school will be merged next semester. She came in a hurry from other places with great expectations in her heart, wanting to bring something new to the children in the village. After working for four years, she watched the number of students drop from more than one hundred to more than thirty. She is a little envious of physical education classes. Campus football education is a Hengyang specialty. Almost every primary school is equipped with a football field and guaranteed physical education class hours. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Luo Xiaohong, the head of the Zhejiang Zhipu Charity Foundation, known as &quot;Huabu&quot;, has been paying attention to the life growth of rural children and the mental health of children in distress for many years. She told Southern Weekend reporters that six years ago, In a county in a mountainous area, there is only one full-time art teacher in all 20 rural primary schools in the countryside. There has been some improvement over the years, but there are still problems that need to be solved urgently. For example, there are 13 establishments in schools with less than 200 students. “Obviously, this (class arrangement) cannot be arranged no matter how you arrange it.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In rural schools, &quot;one teacher uses many people to use it.&quot; &quot;I am now the class teacher in charge of the first grade, responsible for reading classes, labor and skill classes, and also responsible for the quality promotion of our school,&quot; a teacher told a Southern Weekend reporter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When visiting rural schools, Zhang Yaoren found that some teachers who graduated from normal art schools had been teaching their main subjects for more than ten years and no longer taught art, while the original teachers of Chinese, mathematics and other subjects taught part-time instead. Art, music and other courses. Some former art teachers have even become subject leaders of their main subjects, and they “always have some regrets in their hearts” when talking about it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2020, the General Office of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the General Office of the State Council issued the &quot;Opinions on Comprehensively Strengthening and Improving School Aesthetic Education in the New Era.&quot; The opinions proposed that aesthetic education should be included in the entire process of talent training in schools of all levels and types, and should run through all stages of school education. A post-80s teacher from a public primary school in western Hunan is one of the second batch of local art students. I have been teaching for thirteen years and have taught foreign language and math all over the place. In the past two years, the school responded to the aesthetic education policy, and she was able to return to her profession and become a full-time art teacher, making up for her regret at the time: &quot;It&#39;s not that art has no threshold, it&#39;s because they think it doesn&#39;t matter if they don&#39;t teach well and there will be no consequences.&quot;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;Art education has always been considered a &quot;minor subject&quot;. In many cases, the class hours of minor subjects are often &quot;occupied&quot; by the main subjects. Especially in primary schools with limited educational resources, it is more common for the main subject teachers to concurrently serve as the teachers of the minor subjects. The encroachment of the minor subject class hours is &quot;natural&quot;. &quot;Many documents on aesthetic education have been issued at the national level, and it cannot be said that they are not taken seriously. Art teachers like to take art classes, and students also fall in love with art classes, but in many cases they fail to take art classes.&quot; Luo Xiaohong felt heartbroken. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is another mystery in scheduling classes. According to the normal schedule, for example, a Chinese teacher has twelve classes and uses the original Chinese class hours; but in actual operation, a Chinese teacher is given six Chinese classes. The remaining six periods were replaced by art, physical education and other courses, and naturally all &quot;minor subjects&quot; were taken into Chinese language classes. According to Luo Xiaohong&#39;s observations in two counties in Zhejiang, the situation of &quot;two class schedules&quot; has been intensifying in the past two years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A private primary school art teacher comes from a county in Dali, Yunnan, and teaches a village primary school with 250 students. She told Southern Weekend reporters that when she came to Guinan School, she seemed to find a companion all of a sudden. For example, both choose two classes to form one big class. Her school does not take up art time, but in the public elementary school next door, the situation is completely different. &quot;Now there are exams and there are not enough class hours. The teacher has no choice but to do this in order to get good results.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“What I painted twenty years ago, you are still painting”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporters saw at the teaching site that the art teachers who came for training experienced the Guinan experience in the studio The content of aesthetic education in the classroom: understanding materials-obtaining materials-production-teacher comments. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The level of rural teachers obviously varies. The first practical class involved hand-made books, and most of the teachers successfully completed the work. In the second period of the ink painting class, the quality of the teacher&#39;s ink paintings showed a certain difference. While creating, some teachers told Southern Weekend reporters that, in fact, they had not really touched ink for many years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to Guan Yong&#39;s request, an art teacher from Ankang, Shaanxi Province used three different kinds of paper to experience ink. He couldn&#39;t help but think of the students in class. Each student was given a brush, poured a little bit of ink, and asked them to smear on the cardboard box and A4 paper. This was his best effort to help students experience ink. If it is a handicraft class, paper cutting may be the simplest and most convenient. Many teachers told Southern Weekend reporters that the current main teaching format is drawing classes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The reality of rural resource constraints still exists. An art teacher in Huaihua, Hunan Province said that the school’s resources are scarce, and some art class materials even need to be purchased out of own pocket, costing almost 20,000 yuan. “It’s really impossible to do it. The classroom is empty, there is nothing, and the drawing board No, how to teach?&quot; Zhang Yaoren said that in the schools he contacted, students need to bring their own materials. If families cannot provide them, it will be difficult for the courses to continue. &quot;The pain of materials is a scar that has nowhere to hide in art courses.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/16/Hj47ESMSaP91n0rp7AvckUqLyRfBjsQmFyoeVrM1.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;720&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/16/Hj47ESMSaP91n0rp7AvckUqLyRfBjsQmFyoeVrM1.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250960&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;A fire hydrant at Guinan School decorated with student works. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern Weekend reporter Zhang Rui/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;We cannot ensure that every student gets an art book to take home.&quot; The above-mentioned teacher from Hengyang told Southern Weekend reporters that where she lives, even art textbooks are not widely available, and they can only use teaching materials in turns.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The above-mentioned rural teacher from Yunnan said that some teaching content involves high-rise buildings Buildings, zebra crossings, etc. Some rural children have never left the village and have only seen them on TV. &quot;Since high-rise buildings are drawn with lines and squares, we will transform the content and consider how to return to the teaching objectives.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/16/aq5KSZquk7pNJuHuzUjJUZccQX7cQXqiurpR8NNH.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;720&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/16/aq5KSZquk7pNJuHuzUjJUZccQX7cQXqiurpR8NNH.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250961&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Guinan School’s art studio decorates the walls with students’ paper-cutting work. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern Weekend reporter Zhang Rui/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In rural schools, having an art classroom may be a luxury. An art teacher from Shaanxi recalled that when he first came to school, the principal said to him that you were the only art teacher in the school, &quot;just take whatever you want.&quot; He felt his shoulders sink, but soon he realized that this might mean staying away from various competitions and honors. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The training program does not reject urban art teachers. Maybe their schools have excellent resources, but they are still confused about teaching methods. A young teacher from Beijing&#39;s Haidian District asked that the textbook content requires innovation, for example, asking students to color in triangles, but teachers are limited in what they can do. Guan Yong asked, why don&#39;t you make the triangle bigger? Why not design a giant triangle and let students color it freely? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This teacher born in the 1990s suddenly understood. He was born in a normal school majoring in art education, and now teaches at a key primary school in Haidian, responsible for courses from fourth to sixth grade. According to him, there are plenty of classes and resources, and there are no problems with rural teachers taking on concurrent jobs. The school’s art teachers have all received very good professional art training. &quot;The pressure on art teachers comes from the normalization of &#39;listening to and evaluating lessons&#39;.&quot; The above-mentioned young teacher said that another problem is that the two classes a week are often separated by several days, and the content of the teaching materials is trivial, and students&#39; learning is not systematic enough. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After reading the work, he commented that &quot;the children here (compared to the children in Beijing) are more active.&quot; Unlike many rural teachers who were surprised when they first saw the campus, what he experienced was not the art itself, but things other than art. At the scene, a teacher asked whether demonstrations should be conducted for children. This has been one of the teaching models for many years. Guan Yong stopped her. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;An art teacher in Chengzhong Village, Tianhe District, Guangzhou told Southern Weekend reporters that he is an art major and has always painted according to standards and learned painting formulas. When painting, the most important thing to consider is the formula. rather than expressing emotion. She pointed to the students&#39; works on the wall and said, &quot;The first feeling is that it is very free and unique.&quot; She recalled that her children attended the top ten middle schools in the district and participated in the school&#39;s interest classes. As a result, the content and mode of learning were no different from when she was a child. &quot;What I drew twenty years ago, you are still drawing.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Art is a pinch of salt&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Guinan has no internal evaluation activities and rarely participates in peripheral art competitions. Zhang Yaoren explained that the core of art works is self-expression and inner feelings. How can this be scored? And when you look at the works in those competitions, you can often see traces of teacher intervention. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A few years ago, Zhang Yaoren wanted to design a logo. In the folk studio, he saw a monkey-style print. This print later became the logo. In accordance with the collection standards, Guan Yong specially made a beautiful collection certificate with the author&#39;s name and the title of the work on it. During the flag-raising ceremony, the certificate was awarded to the child and a bonus was given. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/16/I1BvI5zZPXHpe53okfU9YdjzV0MHq6UiQ4mf1FVA.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/16/I1BvI5zZPXHpe53okfU9YdjzV0MHq6UiQ4mf1FVA.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250962&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Guinan School Art Museum, where creative materials and student works are stored. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern Weekend reporter Zhang Rui/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;As ordinary people, if they can be nourished by beauty, I believe their lives will be better. &quot;So it&#39;s different,&quot; Zhang Yaoren said, &quot;He might keep his house clean and try to take good care of his family; she might pick a handful of wild flowers from the field and put them on the table to turn a plain meal into a new one. It has to be slightly different...&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When Guinan School held a rural children&#39;s art biennial, a student at the University of Pennsylvania in the United States researched and established a data model to analyze the impact of art education on migrant children. . After analyzing the effects of the first round, a positive conclusion was drawn. Zhang Yaoren is reluctant to utilitarianize and digitize the results to demonstrate the relationship between art and academic performance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He often said that art is a handful of salt, and life needs a little spice. As for the potential and influence of aesthetic education, Zhang Yaoren does not consider these and does not care. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Art should always be about education, not works. School teachers have students’ work observations, and teachers observe and record students’ behaviors, habits, emotions, etc. in the classroom. For example, in the &quot;Final Summary Art Classroom Observation Diary&quot;, an observation diary written in the second semester of the 2020-2021 school year, each student is recorded in terms of classroom performance, regular habits, and presentation of works. One student did not perform well. A teacher wrote: &quot;In the future classroom, I will try to find a creative method suitable for this kind of children.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At least from the perspective of some outsiders, occupying art classes, increasing learning time, and improving The enrollment rate is the key to changing the fate of migrant children. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Shi Lei, the principal of Guinan School, has been thinking about a question since 2017: Who are the people closest to us? &quot;Chefs, waiters, repairmen, cleaners, etc. In real life, our feelings come from them.&quot; Shi Lei said, &quot;Our students have a probability of becoming them. This is a very real problem.&quot; According to statistics, the school only has 35 % of students will enter high school, while the remaining students will enter technical secondary schools, vocational schools, etc. What if they have different feelings about life? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Shi Lei told Southern Weekend reporters that over more than five years, the school has successively invested millions of yuan, renovated classrooms, built art galleries, bought materials, etc., and reduced the school’s enrollment from 2000 to 2018. The number of students has dropped to about 1,200, and tuition fees are low, so the school is losing money almost every year. Some colleagues came to the school to criticize him, and if they had mental problems, they went to see a doctor. &quot;(They don&#39;t understand) Will this help me raise tuition fees, or help me recruit more students?&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is difficult to &quot;copy&quot; Guinan-style art education. Guan Yong contacted some schools in Zhuhai and almost reached the final stage, but gave up due to teacher objections. Guan Yong recalled that the teachers were unwilling to do it because they thought it would increase the workload but bring no additional income. He took the initiative to teach, but the teachers did not agree. &quot;It&#39;s so commonplace,&quot; Guan Yong said, &quot;If you don&#39;t do it, just leave.&quot; Luo Xiaohong told Southern Weekend reporters that they had donated brushes, paints, etc. to some rural schools, but after a few years, the things were still stored there. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;If you understand our students, you will only do more.&quot; Shi Lei said that the children of migrant workers live a busy and unstable life, and lack opportunities to relieve their emotions under the pressure of life. Would life be better if there was one more outlet in a very compact life? After nine years of reading tens of thousands of works, will the aesthetics of life improve? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Shi Lei grew up in a school for the children of a factory. He had contact with many good art teachers and music teachers since he was a child. After a few years, he forgot all his knowledge other than language and mathematics, but he remembered the art classes and music classes in the past, and his life was also different. Thanks to the abundant gifts at that time. &quot;Others see that we have done a lot of works and painted a lot of paintings, but these are the least important in our hearts,&quot; Shi Lei said, &quot;We are not doing this for this thing, what is really important is the process of aesthetic education. ”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 16 Sep 2023 19:25:05 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[癌症晚期旅客登机被拒：航空公司宁担非议背后的考量是什么？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256858]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-16 18:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Recently, a civil aviation news incident has attracted attention. On September 12, 2023, a passenger with terminal cancer booked a Chengdu Airlines ticket at Chengdu Tianfu International Airport but was refused boarding, which attracted public attention. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As can be seen in the video, an old man is sitting in a wheelchair, while another man and the old lady are sitting on the ground and calling airline customer service. The man cried and said, &quot;Nothing is allowed to let me leave. I signed the commitment myself and brought a caregiver with me. Why don&#39;t you let me leave?&quot; Then the man added, &quot;I have cancer. Four months. You said before that if you don&#39;t have heart disease, respiratory disease, or trauma, it&#39;s fine.&quot; The family finally knelt on the ground and begged. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Afterwards, Chengdu Airlines staff responded that the passenger was indeed a terminal cancer patient, and the company has clear regulations not to carry such patients to prevent passengers from becoming unwell during the flight. This regulation is publicized in the &quot;General Conditions of Transport&quot; on the official website. If you are a cancer patient in the early or middle stages, there is no absolute restriction on passengers taking the flight. Netizens&#39; opinions are also polarized. Some netizens said that the airline is impersonal and has &quot;overlord clauses&quot; that &quot;discriminate against passengers.&quot; However, some netizens expressed understanding. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This incident has come to an end, but there are still some issues worthy of analysis. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Firstly, airlines deny boarding to passengers with terminal cancer for safety reasons. Article 6.1.3 of the &quot;General Conditions of Carriage&quot; on the official website of Chengdu Airlines states, &quot;Passengers with the following diseases will not be transported unless special arrangements are made with Chengdu Airlines&#39; consent.&quot; Paragraph 10 of this article refers to &quot;patients with terminal cancer.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, not only Chengdu Airlines is &quot;not allowed to carry&quot;, but all major domestic airlines also have similar or similar regulations. For example, Air China lists in the general conditions of transportation, &quot;Large vertical septum&quot; &quot;Patients with tumors, extremely large hernias and intestinal obstructions&quot; will not be provided with air transportation services unless agreed or with special arrangements; China Eastern Airlines also states in the &quot;Service Instructions for Sick Passengers&quot; that for &quot;patients with large mediastinal tumors, extremely large hernias&quot; and patients with intestinal obstruction&quot;, it is recommended not to choose to fly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It can be seen that Chengdu Airlines is not the only airline that &quot;targets&quot; sick passengers. To be more precise, similar regulations of airlines fall into the category of &quot;rejection of transportation and restriction of transportation&quot;. Although the specific regulations of major airlines are different, the principle behind them is the same: airlines cannot guarantee that they can effectively protect and ensure the safety of passengers during the transportation process. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Revere regulations, revere life&quot; is by no means an empty phrase in the field of civil aviation. Behind every seemingly strange regulation, there are safety accidents, large and small, and bloody lives as a reminder. For passengers with advanced cancer or special diseases, changes in air pressure and oxygen concentration will pose a great threat to life, and there is a potential risk of sudden illness requiring rescue. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, not only passengers with special diseases are not suitable for boarding, but also pregnant women who are 32 weeks or more than 36 weeks pregnant are not suitable for boarding. They require medical permission and diagnosis certificate to board with restrictions. This takes into account the potential health risks of pregnant women during flights. By extension, people suffering from cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases are not suitable for riding roller coasters, and the elderly, weak, sick and young are not suitable for participating in extreme sports such as diving and mountain climbing. This is not a &quot;denial of service&quot; or &quot;discrimination against consumers&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Therefore, the passengers in this incident are more suitable to travel by high-speed rail or car. This can avoid the health risks caused by changes in air pressure and oxygen concentration during flight, and it is easier to get timely information during the trip. medical services. After all, it is much easier to get off the high-speed train or car to see a doctor than to find a doctor while flying. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Secondly, airlines deny boarding to passengers with terminal cancer, which itself reflects the relationship of equal rights and responsibilities between airlines and passengers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this incident, the &quot;letter of commitment&quot; proposed by the parties concerned attracted more attention. Some netizens believed that since the passengers had &quot;signed and promised to bear all the consequences themselves,&quot; it would be inappropriate for the airline to still refuse to board the plane. Although this statement seems reasonable, it ignores the current laws and the actual situation of civil aviation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In terms of civil relations, airlines are just commercial institutions that provide transportation services. Their contractual obligation is to safely transport passengers to their destinations by aircraft; passengers purchase transportation services that meet the face value and do not Healthcare that goes beyond face value. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If passengers with terminal cancer are allowed to board the plane, the airline may not be able to bear the corresponding risks, and the potential costs required will be far greater than the revenue from this single ticket business, including but not limited to passenger accidents Death, flight turning back after a passenger becomes ill, etc. I would like to ask, once the plane is forced to make a temporary diversion or turn back, who will compensate other passengers for the resulting loss of rights and interests? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Civil aviation aircraft are not special-purpose &quot;medical aircraft&quot; and do not have the conditions for &quot;airborne ICU&quot;. Once a sick passenger encounters an emergency and requires medical treatment during the flight, it may be an additional task that the airline is unable to handle and has no obligation to handle. Whether a passenger dies or the plane is forced to turn back in an emergency, the total losses suffered by all parties will undoubtedly be much greater. A &quot;letter of commitment to bear the consequences&quot; that may not be legally binding cannot persuade airlines to ignore possible risks and bear huge potential costs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Therefore, the airline&#39;s refusal to board passengers with terminal cancer is not so much &quot;discrimination&quot; with a more positive or negative meaning, but rather &quot;differential treatment&quot; based on specific circumstances. This &quot;differential treatment&quot; not only shows respect for the safety of passengers&#39; lives and property, but also demonstrates the principle of &quot;equivalence of rights and responsibilities&quot;. Airlines and passengers are both civil subjects, and their rights and obligations are completely equal. Airlines have the right to refuse service to passengers who exceed their obligations and capabilities. Passengers can also choose other air service providers who are willing to take greater risks, or other means of transportation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 16 Sep 2023 18:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[一块钱酸梅汤打败“入秋第一杯奶茶”，网红中药能刷医保吗？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256723]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-16 17:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https:// feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange &quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 16 Sep 2023 17:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[旧房换新房，能否激活淄博楼市？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256841]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-16 16:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/ image/23/09/15/97064ca1ac.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;2048&quot; height=&quot;1366&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/ 15/97064ca1ac.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250933&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;April 10, 2023, Qisheng Lake Park, Zibo, Shandong . (Visual China/Picture)&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;These days, some staff from local government departments always call Li Bin to ask him about the &quot;trade-in&quot; method of buying a house in Zibo. mode and specific operating procedures. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On September 6, 2023, the Zibo Real Estate Development Association and the Municipal Real Estate Brokerage and Appraisal Association jointly launched a signing ceremony for the &quot;old-for-new&quot; home purchase, with the first batch of 12 companies Representatives of real estate development companies and real estate brokerage agencies signed cooperation agreements. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;According to &quot;Zibo Daily&quot;, &quot;old for new&quot; means exchanging old houses for new ones. Real estate development companies and real estate brokerage agencies join forces to speed up the sales of existing housing. Real estate companies give priority to providing high-quality housing to meet the replacement needs of home buyers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;However, there is still a lot of speculation in the market about the specific method of &quot;trade-in&quot;. On the short video platform, some people interpreted that Zibo’s “old-for-new” policy for home purchases this time allows the appraisal agency to “give the money after the old house has been appraised to the home buyer, and the home buyer will then use the money to buy a new home.”&lt;/p >; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Trading old for new&quot; was the earliest housing sales model tried by Beike. On September 13, as the deputy general manager of Shell (Shandong) Internet Co., Ltd., Li Bin clarified to Southern Weekend reporters: When the original customer replaced, if the second-hand house he lived in before could not be sold, he would not have the funds on hand to buy a new house. Deposit. The current &quot;old-for-new&quot; model requires developers, intermediaries and customers to sign an agreement. According to the agreement, after the customer pays the deposit, the developer will give the customer 90-180 days to sell the house and reserve the customer&#39;s favorite house; The intermediary also promotes customers’ second-hand houses on the platform. If the customer&#39;s house is still not sold after the agreement period, the deposit will be refunded. &quot;The core of &#39;trade-in&#39; old for new&#39; is to shorten the replacement cycle between new and second-hand houses.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image /23/09/15/56104f158b.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;2048&quot; height=&quot;1434&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/15 /56104f158b.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250934&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Local Government Concerned about the decommissioning of new houses&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In Shandong, Jinan City was the first to launch the &quot;old-for-new&quot; policy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In July 2023, the Shandong Real Estate Association and the Jinan Real Estate Association held a seminar on the &quot;Real Estate Market Situation in the First Half of the Year&quot;. In addition to the member units of the Shandong Real Estate Association and the Jinan Real Estate Association, the meeting was also attended by the Shandong Provincial Department of Housing and Urban-Rural Development, the Finance and Economics Office of the Provincial Party Committee, the Jinan Municipal Housing and Urban-Rural Development Bureau and some financial institutions. Li Bin remembers that that meeting was the starting point for the debut of &quot;old for new&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;It was recognized by some developers in Jinan at that time.&quot; Li Bin said that in late August, &quot;old for new&quot; began to be piloted in some projects in Jinan. Taking a project of a real estate company as an example, Beike provides home buyers with second-hand house evaluation, listing, inspection and transaction services. For second-hand houses that meet transaction standards, Beike will help customers sell their houses quickly within 30-90 days; the project team Provide 1%-2% home purchase subsidies to buyers of second-hand houses to speed up the sales of second-hand houses. Among them, buyers of first-hand houses can lock in the house they want by paying 100,000 yuan, and then pay for the new house after the second-hand house is sold. If the second-hand house is not sold, they can enjoy check-out guarantee. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Li Bin remembered that at a real estate brokerage seminar held in Zibo in August, staff from the relevant administrative departments in Zibo also expressed their opinions on this &quot;old-for-new&quot; housing buying and selling model. I was very interested and suggested that Zibo&#39;s industry associations could also try to promote it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;The core method is to shorten the transaction time between new homes and second homes, and the government plays a supporting and encouraging role in this.&quot; Li Bin introduced. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Zhuge housing search data shows that from January to July 2023, the price of new houses in Zibo continued to climb, rising from 8,272 yuan/square meter to 8,425 yuan/square meter. But the price dropped to 8,389 yuan/square meter in August. In contrast, Zibo&#39;s second-hand housing prices have been rising month after month, and since November 2022, there has been an inversion of primary and second-hand housing prices. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Li Bin explained to Southern Weekend reporters that &quot;replacing old houses with new ones&quot; requires accelerating the disposal of second-hand houses and at the same time making a good connection with the replacement of new houses. If the second-hand house in the hands of the home buyer cannot be sold, he will not have the down payment for the new house, and he will not be able to make the decision to buy a new house. &quot;Data shows that the average transaction cycle for second-hand houses in Jinan City is now 175 days, and even more than 250 days in Zibo.&quot; In smaller cities and counties, the transaction cycle for second-hand houses will be longer. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Li Bin introduced that the &quot;old-for-new&quot; policy for buying houses will be implemented in many cities in Shandong such as Tai&#39;an and Jining. In addition to Shandong, some cities outside the province also want to learn about relevant experiences. Li Bin found that the local governments who came to communicate would be more concerned about the sale of new houses. “After all, the sale of new houses is the most important means for cities to activate the real estate market.” &lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;There are more people waiting and watching&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;September 8, &quot;Zibo Daily&quot; More than 40 first-hand properties with &quot;old-for-new&quot; agreements were announced. However, several local real estate agents in Zibo told Southern Weekend reporters that more people who want to buy a house are still waiting and watching. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Zhang Yuan (pseudonym), a real estate agent in Zibo City, told Southern Weekend reporters that after the introduction of the &quot;old for new&quot; policy, the number of people viewing houses has increased significantly, more than before. One-third, his daily working hours also increased from the original 12 hours to 14 hours. He said that if the agent fails to sell the old house within the three months stipulated in the agreement, the client will take back the old house and the deposit, which is &quot;equivalent to three months of work in vain.&quot; Zhang Yuan explained that the policy will bring greater workload to the intermediary, but if the client is sure to sell the old house, he will have more confidence to buy a new house. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Another Zibo real estate agent, Sun Yu (pseudonym), updated his policy interpretation on the short video platform on September 8. In addition, he receives twenty or thirty related consultation calls every day. There are people who are in a hurry to sell their old house and buy a new one and ask more than a dozen questions at once, while there are also people who inquire casually and take a wait-and-see attitude. Sun Yu told Southern Weekend reporters that developers of large real estate projects generally do not accept old houses. “If he (the developer) wants to sell new houses, why would he buy second-hand houses?” As for intermediaries, they are generally willing to represent large-property houses. , that is, houses where the owner owns the house and can produce a real estate certificate, &quot;the sales difficulty is low and the transaction rate is higher.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Sun Yu said that the second-hand houses for sale in his hands are mainly located in Zhangdian West District, the main urban area of ​​Zibo, which is also what the intermediary calls Zibo&#39;s &quot;prime location.&quot; The highest price here exceeds 20,000 yuan per square meter, while in the suburbs with the lowest prices, one square meter sells for only 5,000 to 6,000 yuan, which is a quarter of the price in the central city. &quot;The first-hand properties participating in the &#39;trade-in&#39; program are not very easy to sell,&quot; Sun Yu said. Most of them are located in the suburbs of Zibo with relatively poor locations, and the number of houses in the school district is relatively small. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;But there are already customers who have successfully &quot;traded in old products for new ones&quot; with Sun Yu. This is a 35-year-old customer. He needs to sell his old house in the eastern part of Zhangdian District before he can have enough budget to buy a house in a school district. Previously, this old house had been listed on the trading platform for nearly half a year without any interest. In the past few days, Sun Yu sold the client&#39;s old house for 800,000 yuan, and the client spent more than 1.5 million yuan to buy a school district house in the southwest area of ​​Zhangdian. In Sun Yu&#39;s opinion, this is one of the best-located houses in the first-hand real estate that participates in the &quot;old-for-new&quot; project. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Sun Yu currently opens his own real estate agency in Zibo, with more than a dozen employees, and his business focuses on the sale of first-hand and second-hand houses. He said that the current policy has not brought significant changes in sales volume to the company. In 2023, the company&#39;s monthly housing sales will mainly be concentrated in 3 to 5 units. The New Deal has led to more people consulting, &quot;but everyone is very cautious, and there are more people waiting and watching.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 16 Sep 2023 16:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[当“知心闺蜜”恶语相向之前：李佳琦这样的“赛博货郎”何以逆势成功？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256854]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-16 15:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Recently, &quot;the most powerful beauty blogger&quot; Li Jiaqi angrily criticized consumers in the live broadcast room. Li Jiaqi himself has been caught in the whirlpool of public opinion. Even after he apologized in tears, the criticism and accusations against him have not subsided. In addition to pushing him to the forefront of public opinion, this storm has also focused the public&#39;s attention on In the industry of &quot;carrying anchor&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before getting involved in this verbal controversy, Li Jiaqi had built an astonishing business empire through years of hard work in the field of beauty live streaming. The total sales of his short video platform live broadcast room in one month exceeded &quot;Shocking records&quot; such as 1 billion yuan and 15,000 lipsticks sold in 5 minutes have even triggered communication scholars to study its sales discourse system and communication strategies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Judging from the main consumer portraits, Li Jiaqi mainly targets female audiences, which can be seen from his iconic opening remarks &quot;all girls&quot; during his live broadcast. In addition to the skilled symbolic use of &quot;girlfriend accents&quot; such as &quot;Your devil is here&quot;, &quot;Oh my god&quot;, &quot;It&#39;s so pretty&quot;, &quot;Buy it, buy it&quot;, Li Jiaqi is also very good at using hierarchical contrast communication strategies. Through &quot;lifting and stepping on&quot;, we create a &quot;superior&quot; consumption satisfaction for consumers. For example, when describing the lipstick brand as &quot;rustic&quot;, Li Jiaqi would use rhetorical methods such as &quot;the color my mother painted twenty years ago&quot; to awaken consumers&#39; memories. When recommending their own products, they will use rhetorical means such as &quot;You are the peach in the world&quot;, &quot;You will be a lady if you paint it&quot;, &quot;Limited edition of XX color&quot;, etc. to provide female consumers with room for imagination and inspire them. Consumer impulse to place a single trial. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Consumers, mainly female, are willing to spend money in Li Jiaqi’s live broadcast room not only because of their recognition and affirmation of the professional ability of his “lipstick brother”, but also because of his “close friend” trust and favor. Similarly, what female consumers buy in Li Jiaqi’s live broadcast room is not only lipstick and eyebrow pencil, but also emotional value. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So the cause and result of the &quot;censorship incident&quot; are actually very simple. For anchors, under the pressure of the stock game and the economic downturn, even Li Jiaqi, who is precise and proficient in the &quot;girlfriend accent&quot; and &quot;the best understanding of women&#39;s hearts&quot;, has perfect head anchors to mobilize consumers&#39; consumption impulses. Times are not as easy as before, and the resulting fatigue and irritability are themselves a natural reflection of the economic and social environment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For consumers, it is emotionally difficult for consumers to have their “best friends” who have flattered and flattered them in the past and provided full emotional value regardless of whether they consume or not, suddenly lower their faces and say nasty things to them. accepted. Although Li Jiaqi often calls and describes consumers as &quot;princess&quot;, &quot;lady&quot; and &quot;queen&quot;, in fact, his main consumer groups are still mainly working-class people. They are commonly known as &quot;workers&quot; and are involved in the pressure of the workplace. When I was exhausted and tried to find emotional value in the live broadcast room of my &quot;best friend&quot;, I was accused of &quot;not trying hard&quot; by the other party. It is also a normal emotional reaction to get angry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It can be said that the &quot;censorship incident&quot; was actually an instant hedging of the common emotions between Li Jiaqi and consumers under pressure. But Li Jiaqi and consumers are not the only ones under pressure. At a time when &quot;it&#39;s not easy for everyone to make money,&quot; the way for &quot;Li Jiaqi&quot; to make money seems too easy, so the &quot;censorship incident&quot; has become an outlet for that pressure. While the public used this incident to vent their stress and emotions, they also began to think about how &quot;goods anchors&quot; became an &quot;easy to make money&quot; industry in our society. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, Li Jiaqi’s role in the entire beauty industry chain is more similar to that of a salesman selling needles, threads, and cosmetics boxes in pre-modern society. He is neither a producer of goods nor a businessman who opens a store to do business in the traditional sense, but a more special kind of sales terminal. In the old society, due to the restrictions of etiquette, women could neither move around nor obtain information about goods. These housewives, who had limited information and limited knowledge, needed the medium of a salesman to understand and purchase goods. Therefore, in ancient society, a successful salesman must be a person who is familiar with women&#39;s psychological characteristics, masters certain speaking skills, and can speak into women&#39;s hearts. A ballad from the old society goes like this:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Salesman Son, selling flower thread, carrying a load on the street. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Jingle bell shakes to call the girl, and leads her to meet her at the door. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The girl should smile and be angry again, and the price should be cheap and the goods should be new. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fortunately, the salesman is blessed with beauty and often has sex with beauties in his life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It can be seen that modern &quot;beauty anchors&quot; are in the same vein as the ancient salesmen selling needle threads and cosmetics boxes in terms of understanding the psychological characteristics of consumers, formulating targeted marketing strategies, and matching the emotional value of sales. It is precisely because of this characteristic that there was widespread prejudice and discrimination against the profession of peddlers in the old society. It was believed that they behaved improperly and would seduce women whenever they had the opportunity. In Ming and Qing dynasty novels, there were many peddlers who seduced, abducted and trafficked women. The story of a good woman. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From the perspective of business development form theory, peddlers in the old society were the product of poor business information in a closed and semi-closed &quot;acquaintance society&quot; environment. In the information age, there are various sales channels and sales methods, open product information is readily available, and various product advertisements are overwhelming. In this environment, there should be no living space for &quot;cyber peddlers&quot;, at least other It should not occupy such an important position and proportion in modern business activities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But reality is exactly the opposite of theory. The &quot;cyber gangsters&quot; represented by Li Jiaqi have not only bucked the trend and achieved great success in the modern information society, but also work part-time with &quot;Internet celebrities&quot; in some other countries. The business model of carrying goods is different. In my country, &quot;cyber hawkers&quot; have developed into a specialized profession and formed a large professional group, becoming the most important and powerful sales channel and method of online e-commerce. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the world&#39;s largest manufacturing country, the world&#39;s largest informatization country, and the world&#39;s largest online retail country, consumers&#39; consumption habits have returned to a certain extent to the &quot;hawker model&quot; of pre-modern society. , there are actually very profound reasons behind this counter-intuitive, counter-logical, and counter-intuitive reality. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First of all, it is precisely because of the huge abundance of products, the explosive growth of product information, and the seamless coverage of product advertisements that consumers in the ocean of products and information feel confused and confused. . At the same time, the cost of &quot;trial and error&quot; has also increased exponentially, and consumers who are unwilling to delve into relevant knowledge and compare the pros and cons of similar products in order to buy a product will naturally return to &quot;acquaintances&quot; in another sense. Society&quot;, that is, choosing to trust the &quot;enthusiastic recommendations&quot; of the &quot;cyber peddlers&quot; you like. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Secondly, the information society certainly has its noisy and bustling side, but behind the information explosion, surging public opinion, and all-weather socialization, the spiritual loneliness of atomized individuals on the Internet is also a serious problem. As mentioned earlier, what Li Jiaqi, the &quot;cyber salesman&quot; provides, is not just lipstick and eyebrow pencil, but also emotional value. Perhaps, the latter is more important than the former in determining the role of the ancient profession of &quot;cyber salesman&quot; in this modern information age.

His colleagues celebrated him. At the dinner, he thought of the unsolved cases and the uncaught people, and he felt depressed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Shouyue read the news about a fire somewhere in Yunnan on his mobile phone. There was a very familiar face among the passersby. He was sure that it was Chen Xinwen, the main suspect who robbed a cash transport truck and killed his police colleague more than 20 years ago. . Wearing casual clothes, he embarked on the journey alone, carrying a bag of fruit to visit Chen Xinwen, who had been living incognito for many years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/jRRYqkC3rNmbY3a1KtAAEoIW1ZbU1J7s6unHPf1l.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;540&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/jRRYqkC3rNmbY3a1KtAAEoIW1ZbU1J7s6unHPf1l.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250584&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&quot;The Eighth Suspect&quot; (2023)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the movie &quot;The Eighth Suspect&quot; released on September 9, 2023, Hong Kong actor Lin Jiadong Plays the role of retired policeman Wang Shouyue. There is only one gunfight scene in the film, and there is no suspense element. The audience already knows who the person who has not been arrested is. The highlight is the details of the confrontation between Wang Shouyue and Chen Xinwen. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This film will be shortlisted for the main competition unit of the Shanghai International Film Festival in June 2023. When interviewed, rival actors Dapeng (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;plays Chen Xinwen&lt;/span>;) and Sun Yang mentioned that they are used to rehearsing before filming, while Jiadong and Lin The other actors kept their distance and &quot;just come up and give it&quot; to protect the immediacy of their reactions. Lin Jiadong is very relaxed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What they were talking about was an office drama. Wang Shouyue could not bear the noise of construction at the construction site and went to the construction company to report the situation. Chen Xinwen and several others were studying the drawings. Wang Shouyue thought they were studying real estate development, but in fact they were plotting to rob. That was a few days before the shocking case occurred more than 20 years ago. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I don&#39;t know what you will do next, and you don&#39;t know what I will do next, so outside of the camera, we keep a sense of distance.&quot; Lin Jiadong said. He felt this was the best way to communicate that suited the needs of the character. Cheung Song-man, who plays a police colleague, likes to be flexible on the set, and Lam Ji-tung happily accepted the role. &quot;I can change whatever you suddenly change. Because my role is still in my hands, and your role is still in your hands.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lin Jiadong has been a film actor for 22 years. In 2002, he played a policeman in a movie for the first time, as Big B in &quot;Infernal Affairs&quot;. On the rooftop, after the duel scene between Chen Yongren and Liu Jianming pointed guns at each other and revealed their trump cards, the audience thought the outcome was decided. Unexpectedly, in the elevator, Big B appeared and simply killed the real policeman Chen Yongren, revealing his identity as an undercover gangster. The identity caught Liu Jianming, a fake policeman who was also an undercover and wanted to start a new life, off guard. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is the last scene of the whole film. Before this, Lin Jiadong had never seen the complete script, and he really thought that Big B was a good policeman - the director intended it. Suddenly learning that his identity was reversed, Lin Jiadong panicked, fearing that he would make a mistake. At that time, he was still ignorant and needed to listen to the arrangements of his seniors. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In an early episode of &quot;A Date with Lu Yu&quot;, Andy Lau, who played Liu Jianming and was Lin Jiadong&#39;s boss, mentioned that he wanted Lin Jiadong to lose the &quot;air of a TV series&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/Xwtcx2vxeG6phdNkczSzs9mfN7KAhSHKekv8icwR.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/Xwtcx2vxeG6phdNkczSzs9mfN7KAhSHKekv8icwR.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250586&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&quot;Slaying the Wolf: Greedy Wolf&quot; (2017)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lin Jiadong entered the TVB artist training class in 1987. The first time he filmed was during the Spring Festival, which was originally scheduled The actors went on strike, so he had a chance to take over. In the 1990s, he became a relatively successful actor in TV dramas. The high-intensity shooting schedule made him feel brain-blocked and &quot;he wanted to be perfect, but he couldn&#39;t do it.&quot; He wanted to change his life, switched to the film industry, and signed a contract with Andy Lau&#39;s company. &quot;Even if it is an idle role or an inconspicuous small role, when the camera comes to you, you will be the protagonist for the second. Don&#39;t waste this opportunity, play this role well.&quot; He once said in an interview. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Director Johnnie To&#39;s &quot;Underworld&quot; (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 毷体, 毷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;2005&lt;/span>;) has many acting talents, including Simon Yam, Tony Leung Ka-fai, Lam Suet, Nick Cheung did not cover up Lin Jiadong&#39;s shining point. In a year of handover between gangs and winning streaks, the younger generation competes for power. Dongguan Zai, played by Lam Jiadong, is loyal to one of the factions. He is obedient, ruthless, and his ambitions gradually expand. Fans began to recognize him. Soon, the role of the traitor Li Zhao in &quot;Ip Man&quot; (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;2008&lt;/span>;) won Lam Jiadong the Hong Kong Film Awards (&lt; span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;&quot;Hereinafter referred to as the Academy Awards&quot;&lt;/span>;) Nominated for Best Supporting Actor. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/sepyjFDz5nBfX5DhRUB7nlA43arTY2X1K4i8E3fg.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height= &quot;533&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/sepyjFDz5nBfX5DhRUB7nlA43arTY2X1K4i8E3fg.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250589&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&quot;Ip Man&quot; (2008)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hong Kong is rich in police and gangster movies. Lam Jiadong has played both police and gangsters. Some of the policemen he plays are polite and capable, while others are sophisticated. &quot;I have been a policeman many times, and every time I am looking for differences. Because I believe that a person who has lived for so many years must have different mental states, thoughts, and personalities. . I have this opportunity to put different possibilities.&quot; Lin Jiadong said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/bgR83OjJYp2oQWymrd1m26vKCXFEnubavG0JtX1D.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/bgR83OjJYp2oQWymrd1m26vKCXFEnubavG0JtX1D.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250585&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&quot;Cold War&quot; (2012)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2013, he won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his role as Albert, a senior police officer in &quot;Cold War&quot; Nominated. In the film, the hawks and the civil servants are at odds with each other, the rivalry between Tony Leung Ka Fai and Aaron Kwok is brilliant, and the new police officer played by Eddie Peng is a lurking villain who wants to help his father (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: italics, italics_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Tony Leung Ka Fai&#39;s role&lt;/span>;) clears the obstacles to promotion and has a big turn; in comparison, Albert&#39;s image is by no means the fullest and most brilliant, but Lin Jiadong holds his own. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lin Jiadong has also played a kind-faced but cold-blooded gangster. With the indifferent King of Thieves, he also won the Hong Kong Film Awards, the Hong Kong Film Critics Society, and the Hong Kong Film Directors Association Best Actor. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/npjwyFz4FWkI6toJ9VmpUmau97eTgt5bT0KVEMQh.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;660&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/npjwyFz4FWkI6toJ9VmpUmau97eTgt5bT0KVEMQh.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250588&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&quot;Wisdom Teeth&quot; (2021)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2022, he won two Academy Awards for Best Actor for the two films &quot;Hand-Rolled Cigarettes&quot; and &quot;Wisdom Teeth&quot; Protagonist nomination. Among them, &quot;Hand-Rolled Cigarettes&quot; he starred in for zero pay, playing a person abandoned by society: his character Guan Chao was a Chinese-American British soldier more than 20 years ago. After retirement, his life was frustrated, he owed loan sharks, and made a living as a gangster. A hunted Indian in trouble ends up in danger himself. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lin Jiadong is 56 years old this year. His screen image in recent years, from Guan Chao to Wang Shouyue, has a gloomy and aging look. But he himself is well maintained and has a slim figure. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One night in early September, at around 9 o&#39;clock, after a busy day&#39;s work, Lin Jiadong&#39;s interest was still high when he talked about performances, such as &quot;Homicide&quot; (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: italics, italics_ GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;2023&lt;/span>;) His free play in the rooftop scene at the end of the film allowed him to play the numerology master who muttered to himself after the split personality: &quot;I am a flower, I am a flower.&quot; For example, The subtle change in Guan Chao&#39;s attitude toward Indians in &quot;Hand-Rolled Cigarettes&quot; is due to the change of the other person&#39;s name. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He has an excellent memory and can quickly recall the last scene of &quot;Underworld&quot; and how the ambitious Dongguan boy handled the lines breathlessly. From time to time, he added body movements to restore the image of himself locked in a room and thinking hard: he would collapse on the sofa, sit up again for half an hour, and act as if he were reading a script, looking for a breakthrough. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Shouyue is a boring person. After finally retiring, his life still feels like work. This may be a bit like Lin Jiadong. He has appeared on TVB or other TV talk shows many times and said that he is boring and boring. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He is a hard-working actor. Even if he won the Best Actor Award, he said he could only &quot;have fun for 48 hours&quot; and then he would want to work. That year, holding the trophy, he said to himself on the stage, calm down. Then he said, &quot;Over the years, I have felt that acting does not matter age. It does not matter about appearance, the most important thing is your own heart.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The following is Lin Jiadong&#39;s account:&lt;/p>; &lt; h4>;Police feelings&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;I think Wang Shouyue&#39;s character is a bit different. In the past, I have watched many police movies depicting police officers. There isn’t much emotion shown, but this time I think it’s a good opportunity because this character is a person with emotions. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;The first dinner was at the retirement dinner. I actually felt a little depressed and regretful. After more than 20 years, (The suspect) can’t be seen or caught, what should I do? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Later I confronted the character of Dapeng and gradually got to know him. He had done something wrong. A poor man who decided. I saw the newsreel of him at the fire scene, which was not too glamorous, so I wanted to see with my own eyes what he was like now. He must be not doing well, right? I don’t know if we can capture him and by what method. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;In the office scene, the character conflicts have not yet appeared. What I do is follow my body language to put pressure on them: come back - stop - go, talk, come back again, blah blah, like this. I think it can be handled this way, it is enough. If there are too many emotions, it will be fake. You don’t know who they are, and they don’t know who you are. If I want to make the audience feel the pressure through the picture, this reaction of body language is enough. . &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Before every performance, I am used to taking a look at the scene here to adapt to my identity and mood. , my relationship with other characters in it. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;I must respect the style of the director and cinematographer. Some directors and photographers use the lens to help them do a lot of things. They don’t need me to do much. I will cooperate with you on the shooting scene. But if it’s a fixed shot and you let me go, then the camera lens is here, the space is so big, I can do as much as I can in this space. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Emotionality and Sobriety&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;The actor is very emotional inside the camera, but outside the camera We should be sober. I remember who I met and what I talked about every day. I will ask friends with different ideas how they feel about new immigrants. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 凯体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;There are different people in every industry, and I want to feel where their vitality lies. Every time I take a vacation, I chat with some friends from outside the industry. Some are in aquatic services, drive taxis, sell diamonds, do public relations for big brands, and some are bosses, working in finance in Central. Most of my friends are very talkative. If I listen more, I will understand that their life circle, thinking, and common attitude are like this. Their lives satisfy me. I slowly accumulate and build my experience, and I know very concretely about future performances. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;For example, many large companies lay off employees, always laying off front-line people. Your manager’s one month’s labor If the cost is enough for 10 people, it would be enough to lay off one of you. But many companies have more generals than soldiers. Why is it so strange? This involves the issue of human nature. People must protect themselves. But if the general has 10 fewer soldiers, how can he fight? There are really too many problems in life. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;I was originally the villain in &quot;Cold War&quot;. I told the director that I was very happy to play the villain, but it would be very damaging to your movie. In reality, for the management of a large company to survive, it depends not only on how strong the ability is, but also on patience. Don&#39;t go too far, you must know how to accept it. Albert has a doctorate in law and is extremely well-educated. It is impossible for him to be attracted to Peng Yuyan&#39;s role. Two weeks later, the director really changed it and made my character die in the end, which made me happy. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;When I was young, I seldom spoke. My elder sister was the only one who talked at home, and my elder sister didn’t understand. We rarely communicate about boys’ ideas. But I read a lot of things every day, and I’m thinking in my head, why is this like this? Wear a black suit to a wedding banquet. My friend, when I go to a funeral parlor, I wear a black suit, so how do I tell whether it’s a red event or a white event? Lots of whys. Later, when we took a training class, the teacher also told us that life is an experience, and you must remember this feeling. Just think more carefully, watch more, think more, find a root for the character&#39;s personality, and your future creations will be more reasonable. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;My friend and I were very bored. We were hungry after 1 o&#39;clock at night, so we asked where we could eat supper. OK? Tea restaurants are the best, offering both Chinese and Western food and drinks. Takeout, no need. Go in and sit down, eat what you want, and see if you are fat (at this time). If I&#39;m not fat, I like to eat ketchup powder the most. If I&#39;m fat, I can&#39;t drink milk tea or coffee. My friend and I ordered a set meal. I’ll give you the food, and I can just drink this, so there’s no waste. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;The tea restaurant is a very real place without so many shackles. In the hotel, everyone is very quiet, saying something they don’t know (simulating whispers), and no emotion can be seen. There is a very real life in the tea restaurant, people are very willing to express their emotions, and you can learn a little gossip. This is the most comfortable look. I&#39;m going now too.

The director said, I think it’s OK. Really? I feel like I owe a little bit. Director Du said I don&#39;t need it, don&#39;t you believe me? I believe it.

There were only one or two group scenes, and other times there was no opponent, just me acting alone. So I don&#39;t really have much idea. Watching it in the cinema, I thought, can a performance be like this? It turns out that the creative changes are so big. The screenwriter and director know us actors very well and can change us to a certain extent, giving the audience a very new but very real feeling. I think it is very powerful and has a profound impact on me. Then I should still have a chance.

On August 30, 2023, a netizen surnamed Liu with the online name &quot;Liu Shao&quot; reported in real name on the social media platform that there were construction quality problems in the Qinghai Tongsai Expressway Taohe Bridge built by China Railway Fifth Engineering Bureau No. 5 Company. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu claimed to be the actual construction party and began to undertake the substructure project of the Taohe Bridge on April 6, 2022, which lasted more than eight months. He reported that the project leader of China Railway No. 5 Bureau No. 5 Company &quot;did not use steel bars from the shortlisted manufacturers according to the design, privately used non-standard steel bars from non-shortlisted manufacturers, cut corners during construction, and used unqualified sand and gravel materials during winter construction, resulting in poor concrete quality.&quot; qualified&quot;. Among them, statements such as &quot;the pile inspection process changed the second-category piles to the first-category piles&quot;, &quot;80% of the pile foundation steel bars are unqualified&quot; and &quot;there are hidden safety and quality risks&quot; attracted the attention of the outside world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the evening of September 6, the Fifth Company of China Railway No. 5 Bureau issued a public statement stating that it had previously entrusted Qinghai Provincial Traffic Inspection Co., Ltd. as a third-party testing agency to conduct quality inspections on the bridge. The inspection report shows that &quot;the physical quality of the Taohe Bridge meets the design requirements and the quality is qualified.&quot; The steel bars and concrete used in the construction are all qualified, and the pile foundation tests are all Class I piles. Liu&#39;s reports have been refuted one by one. At present, the competent authority has entrusted a testing agency to &quot;conduct physical quality inspection and raw material sampling inspection&quot;, and the re-inspection results will be announced to the public in a timely manner. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu didn’t buy it. He showed evidence to &quot;Running News&quot; and said, &quot;The test report I got contains Class II piles.&quot; The pouring time was May 26, 2022. The test date is June 29, 2022. Liu admitted that he made the report because the Fifth Company of China Railway No. 5 Bureau not only refused to pay him for his labor services, but instead cleared him from the site, causing heavy losses to him. “Now I have to report the project quality issues even if I don’t need any money.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to media reports, Liu was sued by China Railway No. 5 Bureau No. 5 Company to the People&#39;s Court of Ledu District, Haidong City, Qinghai Province for infringing the company&#39;s reputation rights because he reported that his labor fees had not been settled. The case will be heard in court on September 18. Liu also presented evidence, saying that he had received a message from the other party &quot;Look at the hardness of our China Railway No. 5 Bureau&quot; after reporting with his real name; the other party also proposed a &quot;compensation plan&quot;, but he did not agree if he was not satisfied. The Fifth Company of China Railway No. 5 Bureau responded that Liu’s main purpose was blackmail and “I will report it as soon as I don’t get the blackmail.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This incident has evolved to this point and has gradually become &quot;out of focus&quot;: the dispute between Liu and China Railway has become a new hot spot. A closer look at this incident reveals that there are actually two important aspects that deserve further analysis and questioning. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First, the relationship between the civil dispute between Liu and the Fifth Company of China Railway Fifth Engineering Bureau and his reporting behavior. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Whether it is Liu&#39;s self-report or the &quot;extortion of money&quot; accusation from China Railway No. 5 Bureau, it is shown that the report was due to Liu&#39;s financial demands and that the two parties had a civil dispute. But what is curious is why the case was initiated by China Railway No. 5 Engineering Co., Ltd. against Liu for &quot;infringement of reputation rights&quot; instead of Liu launching a civil lawsuit against China Railway No. 5 Engineering Co., Ltd. due to a labor contract dispute? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The cause of this incident was an economic dispute over &quot;unpaid labor fees&quot;. Following this line of thought, Liu first reported the problem when he could not get the labor fee, but was sued for &quot;infringement of reputation rights&quot;. Then, instead of filing a civil lawsuit on the grounds of a labor contract dispute and demanding payment of the labor fee, he filed an online lawsuit He reported that the project was cutting corners and materials, saying &quot;I have to report project quality problems even if I don&#39;t get labor fees,&quot; and rejected China Railway&#39;s compensation plan. This shows that Liu escalated the incident at all costs, giving the outside world the impression that &quot;the fish is dead and the net is broken.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Looking at the evolution of the incident, there are still some questions hidden in the game between the two parties during this period: Has Liu&#39;s labor fee been settled? If it was indeed not settled, Liu initially went to China Railway Fifth Engineering Bureau and the relevant departments in Qinghai to report this problem. I am afraid it was just a normal rights protection. Why was he sued by the Fifth Company of China Railway Fifth Engineering Bureau for &quot;infringement of the company&#39;s reputation rights&quot;? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the chat records provided by Liu, the words of a person from the China Railway No. 5 Bureau after the real-name report, &quot;The more you cause trouble, the less afraid I am. Look at the hardness of our China Railway No. 5 Bureau&quot; to the outside world. It leaves more room for interpretation. This sentence can make people reasonably speculate that Liu chose to &quot;turn the table&quot; by exposing the quality problems of the project precisely because his demands for labor fees were repeatedly ignored by the other party. So, will the labor fees be settled on time, or will the compensation plan of China Railway No. 5 Bureau No. 5 Company satisfy Liu after the report, and the matter will be settled smoothly? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If Liu came out to expose the project quality problems just because the labor fees were not paid, and the project quality problems were true, then the whole incident would have the flavor of &quot;unevenly sharing the spoils, and turning the table over in anger&quot;. The problem behind it is undoubtedly more worrying; or, if the truth is as claimed by China Railway No. 5 Bureau No. 5 Company, Liu intends to &quot;extort money&quot;, then whether the test results and the evidence he presented are forged, and how much his labor fees are? A clear answer should also be given as to why it was not settled and why it was not settled. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Secondly, whether the truth of the incident is that Liu extorted money or that the Fifth Company of the China Railway Fifth Bureau was in arrears of labor fees, it cannot conceal the most important focus of this incident: whether the construction of the Taohe Bridge on the Tongsai Expressway was completed. Through safety inspection, whether there are any project quality problems. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Public information shows that the Tongsai Expressway has a total length of 204 kilometers, and the total estimated investment of the project is 18.562 billion yuan. The main project will start on June 15, 2022, and is planned to be completed in October 2025. This expressway connects Qinghai Huangnan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture and the Qinghai-Gansu border area. It is a section of the &quot;G0611 Zhangwen Expressway&quot;. The Taohe Bridge is located in Saierlong Township, with a total length of 824.5 meters and a total of 20 spans. On July 17, 2023, the first box girder of the bridge was successfully erected. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu Mou chose to report after the substructure project of the Taohe Bridge was completed and the first box girder was successfully erected. Judging from the current situation, it was because of the intensification of economic disputes. Which one is more convincing is the previous test results announced by the fifth company of China Railway Fifth Engineering Bureau, the test results of the supervision company commissioned by Liu himself, and the evidence presented. This is something that the competent authorities should conduct an in-depth and serious investigation in the follow-up. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, inconsistencies between actual construction and prior surveys are relatively common in the engineering community. If Liu&#39;s accusation is true and China Railway No. 5 Bureau No. 5 Company chooses &quot;non-standard steel bars, unqualified sand and gravel materials and Class II piles&quot; in construction, its impact on the quality of the project will also need to be determined through professional evaluation. The key to the problem is whether changing construction materials will affect the quality of the project and thus endanger the safety of the Taohe Bridge. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In short, the focus of this matter should not be on the dispute between Liu and China Railway No. 5 Bureau. Relevant departments should adhere to the principle of safety first in the follow-up investigation, focus on the inspection of project quality, investigate whether the fifth company of China Railway No. 5 Bureau made normal changes in construction materials or cut corners, and fully demonstrate the impact of changes in construction materials on the traffic of the Taohe Bridge. impact on safety and fully disclose the findings to the public. If there is indeed a case of cutting corners and affecting the quality of the bridge, the relevant responsible persons should be severely dealt with and even held criminally responsible; if the whistleblower spreads rumors and causes trouble, he cannot go unpunished. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 16 Sep 2023 11:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[“数字”间谍来自何处？有何招式？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256665]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-16 10:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;span>;The current development of network technology is rapid, and new things such as 5G, Metaverse, ChatGPT and so on are emerging.

The notebook is filled with comments from netizens who &quot;spite&quot; him, such as &quot;Wang Dongling is a braggart&quot; and &quot;Wang Dongling has gone crazy...&quot; Wang Dongling opened the notebook, which contained both serious critical articles and vulgar abuse. &quot;When a compilation of information about me is printed in the future, all of this can be printed.&quot; Wang Dongling said with a smile. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/15/iEHpMrxz8zLzg2FWn0ChNAsStIgboEFTZZuRnxUS.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;671&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/15/iEHpMrxz8zLzg2FWn0ChNAsStIgboEFTZZuRnxUS.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250939&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In November 2016, Wang Dongling&#39;s calligraphy art solo exhibition opened at the Taimiao Art Museum in Beijing, and he was swiping at the scene. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Dongling is a calligrapher, but he is also happy to be called a calligrapher. modern artist. Rather than being praised by his peers, the &quot;chaotic books&quot; he created gained more from the incomprehension of ordinary audiences. Wang Dongling&#39;s &quot;chaotic calligraphy&quot; is not the first to be criticized for modern calligraphy, and it will certainly not be the last. In recent years, netizens have criticized Zeng Xiang&#39;s &quot;Roaring Book&quot;, Zhang Qiang&#39;s &quot;Blind Book&quot; and Shao Yan&#39;s &quot;Shooting Book&quot;... As the name suggests, when creating &quot;Roaring Book&quot;, Zeng Xiang was drunk. He seemed to be mad, roaring and yelling; when Zhang Qiang wrote, he didn&#39;t look at the brush and the writing object, and applied it by hand; Shao Yan filled the ink with a needle and sprayed the words on the rice paper, which can be said to follow the shape of the object... Popular opinion Not understanding these various new &quot;calligraphy&quot;, some people simply call them &quot;ugly calligraphy&quot;. In the newly released movie &quot;The Story of Yong&#39;an Town&quot;, the director who is good at ridicule pokes fun at the film industry, but also satirizes the &quot;Master of Shouting Books&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Compared with them, Wang Dongling still looks like traditional calligraphy at least in the &quot;movements&quot; of his creation - but people still can&#39;t see clearly what he wrote in his &quot;random calligraphy&quot;. When I open a piece of Wang Dongling&#39;s &quot;chaos calligraphy&quot; work, I can see intersecting lines, like dead branches on the ground, and like swords fighting in chaos, but not a single clear and independent Chinese character can be seen. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/15/x5vR2CmqqVYEed2yUX4uTTTlYb5NIYaqNd2Ilqkg.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height= &quot;683&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/15/x5vR2CmqqVYEed2yUX4uTTTlYb5NIYaqNd2Ilqkg.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250938&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Wang Dongling&#39;s &quot;Li Bai Poetic&quot; calligraphy installation was exhibited at the China Academy of Art Museum&#39;s &quot;Calligraphy·Not Calligraphy - 2019 International Modern Calligraphy Art Festival&quot;. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At a social inscription scene, Wang Dongling asked the organizer with a sly smile, &quot;Do you want me to Should you write more messily or be more disciplined?&quot; The words to be inscribed were &quot;Art for a better life&quot;. The organizer nodded Weiwei and said, &quot;Be more disciplined, be more disciplined.&quot; Wang Dongling picked up the brush and thought for a moment. Several big words had already fallen on it. on paper. Looking carefully, the strokes of these characters are indeed much more &quot;regular&quot;, with adhesion but little overlap. &quot;My characters are not very intertwined, but there is still some expressiveness in them.&quot; Wang Dongling told Southern Weekend the reporter said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Like Wang Dongling, Zeng Xiang, Shao Yan and Zhang Qiang can also write very &quot;proper&quot; characters. When the public laughs at them, few people ask why they give up &quot;proper&quot; writing. Calligraphy, doing these things that look like performance art? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/15/RwoyLDwCx3eScTYdhSSixPRJawmBEqWliHGpfpxU.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height= &quot;655&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/15/RwoyLDwCx3eScTYdhSSixPRJawmBEqWliHGpfpxU.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250935&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Not all of Wang Dongling&#39;s works are in the form of &quot;chaotic calligraphy&quot;. The picture shows his works on display at the Zhejiang Art Museum in 2021. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Everyone has the desire to criticize and explain. I am now a target to let people have this desire. It looks good to me,&quot; Wang Dongling said. Nearly eighty years old, he seems to be in a good mood. He said that when he was young, he could not hear scolding, which would make him feel uncomfortable, but now he has become &quot;early&quot;, and he would sometimes laugh out loud when looking through the notebook with &quot;dirty information&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Breaking the &quot;Word Barrier&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Wang Dongling has a thin figure, with dry white hair and messy hair. Sometimes she speaks in a breathless voice, and you have to get closer to hear it clearly. It was startling. If his voice is compared to a calligraphy work, then his layout is what Deng Shiru said: &quot;It can be sparse but airtight.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/15/XMW6phxDtMlF5HkI3kvGnoKS5L39KNQEgz0DBVNJ.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height= &quot;673&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/15/XMW6phxDtMlF5HkI3kvGnoKS5L39KNQEgz0DBVNJ.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250937&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Wang Dongling once presented Chinese cultural classics in the form of &quot;chaotic scripts&quot; and &quot;wall scripts&quot;. The picture shows the large-scale mirror wall book &quot;I Ching&quot; he exhibited in 2016. It is written on a stainless steel plate with white paint and is 32 meters long and 3.5 meters high. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The first impression given by &quot;Chaoshu&quot; is its white cloth and unique composition. &quot;Zhangfa&quot; and &quot;Bubai&quot; are calligraphy terms, which refer to the arrangement, layout and mutual response between words and lines during the entire writing process. In traditional calligraphy works, the line spacing is roughly clear, and the strokes cannot cross between words. Even the continuous grass of the late Ming Dynasty will still generally abide by such rules. &quot;Look at Xu Wei&#39;s &quot;Ying Zhi Ying Sword&quot;, there are a few places where the strokes touch and cross, but it is not obvious.&quot; Wang Dongling zoomed in on Xu Wei&#39;s work on her mobile phone and kept zooming in until the complete picture could no longer be seen. Glyphs and dancing lines fill the entire phone screen. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When he was a child, Wang Dongling observed an old tree in front of his teacher’s house, and the zigzag lines were imprinted in his memory. Later, he also looked at the trees in the American wilderness and found that the lines created by the vitality of the trees were different, but intersected harmoniously. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Every winter, he goes to see the dead lotuses on the West Lake. He has more than 20,000 photos of dead lotuses on his computer. Look at the dead lotus stems, all scattered and scattered, seemingly chaotic, but there is an underlying order in the chaos. When the ideographic nature of Chinese characters is completely covered up - like the enlarged Xu Wei that makes it difficult to see what character it is, then only the lines of the Chinese characters are left in front of the viewer&#39;s eyes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the history of calligraphy, the &quot;overlapping&quot; of characters can be traced back to Yan Zhenqing&#39;s &quot;Seat Struggle&quot;, but that may be unconscious. When it came to Xu Wei, &quot;I think his calligraphy was intended to break the line spacing,&quot; Wang Dongling said. Later, Zheng Banqiao&#39;s calligraphy was called &quot;paving the streets with random stones.&quot; &quot;In fact, they all wanted to break the calligraphy and line spacing.&quot; &quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Chaoshu&quot; is to push this &quot;break&quot; to the extreme. If you look at Wang Dongling&#39;s random writing process, every word he writes is actually in accordance with cursive writing (cursive, a calligraphy term, refers to the cursive writing rules of Chinese characters. The cursive writing of each character is roughly fixed and conventional). &quot;It&#39;s nothing more than an overlap.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When words overlap and strokes intertwine, the viewer cannot clearly see what is written. Therefore, the &quot;word barrier&quot; for Chinese people to read calligraphy is broken, and they can concentrate on feeling the lines. flow. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/15/A8S5wOWaeRQwSuOfYRqzliYcZV6WtpKzCLP7BfPV.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height= &quot;663&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/15/A8S5wOWaeRQwSuOfYRqzliYcZV6WtpKzCLP7BfPV.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250936&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In 2021, the 60-year exhibition of Wang Dongling&#39;s calligraphy art was held at Zhejiang Art Museum. The picture shows an audience staying in front of Wang Dongling&#39;s works. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For Chinese people, when they look at a piece of calligraphy, they first of course want to understand what it says. , in Wang Dongling&#39;s opinion, is a &quot;writing barrier&quot;, which keeps many ordinary people away from the deeper beauty of calligraphy. Just like someone listens to his mother tongue and understands the meaning, but unconsciously ignores the beauty of the pronunciation. Only people who do not understand the language at all will notice the high and low pitch values ​​and the gentleness of the timbre when listening. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Calligraphy has developed over thousands of years. Traditional calligraphy has been very perfect and mature. It is difficult for you to break through at all.&quot; Wang Dongling said that calligraphy has two attributes, one is cultural attribute, and the other is cultural attribute. It is Chinese characters written by Chinese people, so we naturally want to understand it, &quot;There is nothing wrong with this&quot;, but another attribute of calligraphy is its artistic attribute. If you admit that it is an art, then it must Have personality and express the creator.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Chaotic script is the extension of ancient cursive script.” This is Wang Dongling’s own understanding of chaotic script. He puts his creation into the track of the ancients, “Of course my heart is not as wild as Xu Wei’s. , but you must have passion to write cursive.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>; Can people who understand music learn calligraphy faster? &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Walking into Wang Dongling’s studio, the floor is covered with all kinds of manuscript papers, rice paper, and albums. It can be said to be a “street full of paper.” This studio has received many foreigners who admired Chinese calligraphy. &quot;Professor Wang Dongling gave me my first calligraphy lesson.&quot; In 2015, Apple CEO Tim Cook said on Weibo. At that time, Cook visited Wang Dongling&#39;s studio, and Wang Dongling taught him to use Apple pencil to write the word &quot;goodbye&quot; with calligraphy strokes on the iPad. Prior to this, he was invited to Apple headquarters in California to provide professional calligraphy advice on the iPad’s writing capabilities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For Apple, this Weibo undoubtedly has a strong marketing temperament, but Wang Dongling does not reject invitations from other cultures. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In March 1989, Wang Dongling went to give lectures at the University of Minnesota in the United States. What he brought with him was a large pen and the &quot;Longzang Temple Stele&quot; which he copied repeatedly. Wang Dongling still remembers the winter in Minnesota, when there was heavy snow outside the window, and his car was stuck deep in the snow, like an ink mark in the snow. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Dongling’s English is very poor. In his own words, when he first arrived in the United States, he didn’t know all 26 letters. So far, I may only recognize 200 words. But he is very willing to exchange calligraphy with foreigners. In 1981, Wang Dongling received a master&#39;s degree in calligraphy from Zhejiang Academy of Fine Arts (now China Academy of Art) and stayed at the school to teach. At that time, Zhejiang Academy of Fine Arts was the only school in the country that majored in calligraphy, so the Ministry of Culture sent all international students studying calligraphy to Zhejiang Academy of Fine Arts. From then on, Wang Dongling took on the task of teaching calligraphy to international students. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Even now, many people still feel that it is impossible to teach Westerners to learn calligraphy. They do not understand ancient Chinese, and learning Chinese characters does not happen overnight. But Wang Dongling&#39;s teaching practice told him that this does not seem to be the case. &quot;They often make mistakes in stroke order and structure, and even write wrong words. But this is not a problem.&quot; In Wang Dongling&#39;s view, foreigners have overcome the &quot;writing barrier&quot; from the beginning. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;British art historian Gombrich once concluded that the role of calligraphy in Chinese culture corresponds well with music in European culture. Wang Dongling&#39;s experience tells him that students who have previous musical accomplishments will learn faster. &quot;The form of cursive calligraphy art is a division of space by overflowing tension and irregular lines. This kind of space displayed after black and white treatment is full of changes in virtual reality and rhythm, and it is a musical space.&quot; Wang Dongling said . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Internet celebrity &quot;Teacher Andy&quot; of Bilibili, who is now over seventy years old, has been working tirelessly to popularize Western classical music to the public on the Chinese Internet in recent years. His full name is Andreas Stier. German, he is a piano professor at the Hamburg State University of Music. He was once a student of Wang Dongling. Wang Dongling still remembers that in the 1980s, he took Andy Shi and several other international students to the home of Mr. Lu Yanshao. Mr. Lu Yanshao read the works of several foreign students in turn and saw the &quot;Silence&quot; in the &quot;Taishan Diamond Sutra&quot; written by Andy Shi. &quot;Chinese people have not been able to write at this level for a long time.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1990, Wang Dongling was in the United States, watching various contemporary art and contemporary dances. Once, he watched an artistic performance by American middle school students. There were solo dances and group dances of three people. The children were twisting their bodies unscrupulously. &quot;Their body language made me feel that no matter how innovative Chinese calligraphy is, it should be allowed,&quot; he said. &quot;Wang Dongling said that graffiti, like dancing, is one of human instincts. &quot;The writing of Chinese characters has a strong graffiti nature. Calligraphy is a spiritual artistic product that combines human instincts with Chinese characters.&quot; And in Kuangcao. In &quot;Kang Cao&quot;, human instincts are released as much as possible. &quot;Kang Cao is greatly weakened from the constraints of ranks, providing a free world for the author to express space. In Kuang Cao, the writing, rhythm and rhythm of calligraphy are brought into full play.&quot; ”&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Traditional calligraphy, Jianghu style, modern calligraphy&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Although Wang Dongling looks thin, in the face of the physically demanding calligraphy, he can write the large-scale &quot;Thousand-Character Essay&quot; 》. It took four hours to write a random piece of &quot;The Thousand Character Essay&quot;. In Wang Dongling&#39;s own words, it was indeed improvised writing, but it was not a &quot;disordered accident, but a kind of muscle memory after years of training.&quot; And when writing, you should always pay attention to the connection between words and the overall layout. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Qi Gong once said, &quot;Layout is very difficult.&quot; Layout has also become one of the criteria that distinguishes professional calligraphers from calligraphy enthusiasts generally known as &quot;Jianghu style&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Wang Dongling&#39;s opinion, the current people who study calligraphy can be roughly divided into three types of people. One type is those who follow the traditional path, conscientiously write posts and monuments, and write &quot;good-looking&quot; characters according to traditional standards. This type of people is the cornerstone of calligraphy. The second category is the &quot;jianghu style&quot;. &quot;With the participation of all people now, there must be some people who are not good at basic skills but are eager for quick success and quick success. They attract people&#39;s attention but have no level. These people can be called &#39;jianghu style&#39;.&quot;&lt; /p>; &lt;p>;There are also some people who want calligraphy to become a breakthrough modern art. Not only are there people like Wang Dongling who are making breakthroughs within calligraphy, but there are also people who are combining calligraphy with contemporary art such as installation, performance, and video. Some of the &quot;ugly books&quot; considered by the public come from the Jianghu style, and a large number of them come from this group. Wang Dongling also makes no secret that he belongs to the third category. Although his daily training is the same as that of traditional calligraphers, he also has to write calligraphy every day. &quot;In the final analysis, modern calligraphy is to express people&#39;s emotions. I am a firm supporter of modern calligraphy and Promoter&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Few people know that the establishment of the first calligraphy major in China actually came from the influence of modern calligraphy. After World War II, Japan regarded calligraphy as an art, engaged in modern calligraphy and avant-garde calligraphy, and attached great importance to the popularization of calligraphy education. In the early 1960s, Pan Tianshou went to Japan to study calligraphy and was deeply moved. He returned to Hangzhou and founded China&#39;s first calligraphy and seal cutting major at the Zhejiang Academy of Fine Arts with Sha Menghai, Lu Weizhao and others. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1979, Zhejiang Academy of Fine Arts was commissioned by the Ministry of Culture to recruit the first master&#39;s degree students in calligraphy in the country. Wang Dongling became a student of Sha Menghai, Lu Weizhao and other gentlemen, and was one of the first five masters of calligraphy in New China. In the autumn of 1980, Wang Dongling accompanied Mr. Sha Menghai to Beijing to see the original stone drum exhibition at the Palace Museum. I have read Han Yu&#39;s &quot;Song of the Stone Drum&quot;, seen the original rubbings of &quot;The Inscriptions on the Stone Drum&quot;, and read Wu Changshuo&#39;s &quot;The Inscription on the Stone Drum&quot;, but when I saw the original copy of the Stone Drum, &quot;Even if I don&#39;t look at the specific words, the kind of text that the Stone Drum carries The atmosphere of ancient times makes people deeply moved. This experience is the same as looking at the statue in front of Huo Qubing&#39;s tomb, which is very wonderful.&quot; In Wang Dongling&#39;s own memories, this trip to Beijing brought a great shock to his artistic concept. &quot;I feel that the highest state of calligraphy is far from the stability and exquisiteness of pointillism. What is more important is that lines can carry abundant vitality and inexhaustible vitality.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the 1990s, Wang Dongling After returning to the United States, he began to devote himself to promoting and practicing modern calligraphy. Since then, he has been subjected to pressure and ridicule from all walks of life. At first, there were doubts from the professional calligraphy community. In recent years, the situation has reversed. The professional calligraphy community has turned to a positive evaluation of him, but the public in the Internet age has made an even harsher voice. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Dongling has some intuitive self-explanations to explain the creation process of chaos books to the public, such as Huai Su watching the peaks of summer with many strange clouds, Zhang Xu watching Gongsun Auntie dancing with a sword, Huang Tingjian watching the boatmen rowing, all enlightened He developed new calligraphy skills, and connected his random calligraphy with the residual lotus. When asked if this was an afterthought, he smiled and said, &quot;the two grew out of each other.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Like Zeng Xiang, the &quot;master of shouting&quot;, he likes to write big characters. When he writes, there are many onlookers - but Wang Dongling basically doesn&#39;t shout. When writing calligraphy, people are watching and cheering. This is also a tradition. When Zhang Xu writes cursive script, people often watch him. Jin Shengtan listed thirty-three joyful things in life, one of which is &quot;How wonderful it is to watch people write big books in a nest!&quot; He also hopes that people can enjoy calligraphy with the mood of &quot;It is wonderful&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Dongling supports the innovation of calligraphy as a modern art, but he seems quite hesitant about one question. A reporter from Southern Weekend asked him: &quot;Will the innovations of some young people with weak basic skills be successful?&quot; Will it be superficial? But if young people follow the tradition and practice to the state of &quot;old people and books&quot; as the ancients said, and then make innovations and breakthroughs, have they missed the best time in their lives? Is there any hidden meaning in this? Contradiction?&quot; For a person who is still enthusiastic about creation when he is nearly eighty years old, this may not be a problem. Wang Dongling paused for a long time and replied: &quot;Creation must have good basic skills. People with good basic skills should promote them. Create more.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 16 Sep 2023 09:25:03 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
