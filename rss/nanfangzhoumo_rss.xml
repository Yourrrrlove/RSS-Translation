The sudden release of &quot;Titanic&quot; stirred the air in every street and alley, and the owner of the disc rental house held the key to the world of Narnia. At that time, the &quot;eMule&quot; was not yet a means of transportation. It needed to be paired with the shooter&#39;s plug-in subtitles to travel. Cinema chains and video websites have arrived, occupying both the government and the opposition, and the old territory has been determined. The weird thing about time is that you don’t know what it will take away and what it will leave behind. Fortunately, the movie sets up an eternal Neverland, allowing you to easily escape into two or three hours of reality. Kuang Huifeng&#39;s &quot;Double Tune Looking at the South of the Yangtze River&quot; says: &quot;Seeing that the flowers in the painting never fall, I moved home and became the person in the painting.&quot; How similar is the situation. Due to a little salvage in the river of memory, the most impressive movies are listed as follows:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/ 08/7jnTKEiYQoezSHAm6gGbi0rn5Z2tBXDsiA0jOnBd.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;499&quot; height=&quot;707&quot; data-src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/7jnTKEiYQoezSHAm6gGbi0rn5Z2tBXDsiA0jOnB d. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;257533&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;Old Things in the South of the City&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;That generation of female writers who crossed the sea seemed to have a unique temperament, the tide and the gravel After polishing, the text will exude a light luster like a mother-of-pearl. Such as Lin Wenyue, who Yu Guangzhong calls &quot;sensitive and gentle&quot;, and another example is Lin Haiyin. Fortunately, I became familiar with &quot;Old Stories in the South&quot; at the right time window (before puberty) and got the chance to watch the movie of the same name. &quot;I have never seen the sea, I can&#39;t tell the difference between the sea and the sky, and I can&#39;t tell the good guys from the bad guys.&quot; When did that pure world shatter before our eyes? When her father&#39;s tombstone gradually disappeared in the autumn mountains, and finally became smaller than a red leaf, Eiko on the carriage drove away from her childhood. After my grandmother passed away this summer, I suddenly remembered this long shot. Although I have lived as a sojourner for many years and have already reached a de facto relationship with my hometown, I know that a small piece of my past related to my life has been lost forever. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In my opinion, &quot;Old Things in the South of the City&quot; is the Chinese version of &quot;Education of Love&quot;. The flowing and subtle emotions in it rely on the movie to materialize them one by one. If combined with the watercolor illustrations painted by Guan Weixing for this book, we can almost achieve an all-round intertextuality that &quot;contains names and images, and encompasses audio and visual content.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/a1kmmF8DYauAMKeZov9aOH8JG6dyqtwoszpFblQP.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;537&quot; height= &quot;716&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/a1kmmF8DYauAMKeZov9aOH8JG6dyqtwoszpFblQP.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;257530&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>; &quot;Tiexi District Yanfen Street&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&quot;Mu Gang&quot;, &quot;Singles&quot; and &quot;Dance Master&quot; are about the Northeast of the Era. Director Yu Guangyi is exactly what I have seen since childhood. , typical Tunguska physiognomy. &quot;Tiexi District&quot; is different. It&#39;s so close that it&#39;s almost a complete piece of my world of experience. The mixed smell of fresh snow, sewage and burning firewood opened the random door of memory. I could walk freely through Yanfen Street without wearing VR glasses. When the curtain of mountains and dense forests is removed, even cruelty cannot be transformed into tragedy. There is no magic, only reality. The child chewed dirty words, the boy&#39;s courtship process was like a threat, and the topic on Yanfen Street gradually focused on relocation. &quot;Sooner or later, we have to leave. No one can stop the weather.&quot; The middle-aged man sitting on the beam said it so lightly, as if what he was smashing was not his own house. I can&#39;t tell you exactly how I acquired this bitter optimism, even though I, like him, have long been accustomed to facing the fate of snow-capped mountains. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/25LMKLctd96yJ54Vb3QSisblSMkmMHEq1LiKCw8R.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;515&quot; height= &quot;724&quot; data-src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/25LMKLctd96yJ54Vb3QSisblSMkmMHEq1LiKCw8R.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;257529&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt; strong>;&quot;Eavesdropping Storm&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Liu Zongyuan has an interesting &quot;Essay on Corpse Insects&quot;, which describes a kind of corpse insect that lives in the human belly. It specializes in listening to people&#39;s words, recording them secretly, and reporting them to the Emperor of Heaven on every Gengshen Day: &quot;Because of this, many people have been banished, suffered from illness, and died young.&quot; Mrs. Liu then cursed bitterly: &quot;Come on, corpse insect! Don&#39;t you recognize your own shape? It&#39;s dark and treacherous, and it contains people, and it&#39;s like a thief. The old man is in this place, and he doesn&#39;t choose to be filthy and humble. He quietly listens in silence. , leading people to wrongdoing. Holding the slips secretly shakes the opportunity for disaster; the humble fists are shrinking, and the house is dangerous. Use bends as form, evil as quality. Use benevolence as evil, use blasphemy as good... , He keeps his ingenuity, is jealous of others&#39; abilities, and is lucky to lose others.&quot; His awns are sharp and sharp, especially in &quot;The Legend of the Grasshopper&quot;. In fact, locusts are greedy and short-sighted, but they do not necessarily harm people; the plague of corpse insects is even more unknown to Yiyu Hudi. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, I am talking about &quot;The Overheard Storm&quot;. After watching the film, my friend and I fell into a long silence. Its goodness is self-evident, and its goodness also makes us sad. The story has a heart-warming ending, but the reality is that insects are &quot;less stupid than stupid, but they still harm benevolent people.&quot; It is said that the clean version deleted the scene where Wiesler was awakened to some kind of life force after the wiretapping. Why bother. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/7soD4BNiaDLDWmfcIEvG5x8pokSDhYPmBp4Y519v.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;566&quot; height= &quot;802&quot; data-src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/7soD4BNiaDLDWmfcIEvG5x8pokSDhYPmBp4Y519v.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;257534&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt; strong>;&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Brothers in their early days&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Al Pacino, Christopher Walken, and Alan Arkin, each of them has been together for decades His experiences, sorrows and joys are combined into an atypical gangster film. The two old friends were released from prison and nursing home respectively into the market. Doc quickly tied up the thread, and what followed was a bucket list-style unfolding. Val invites a strange girl to join him on the dance floor at a bar - an apparently staged dance. Under the dim light, the faces of Val and Colonel Sfarlan kept overlapping each other, and even the two dance partners standing at opposite ends of time were somewhat similar. Hirsch relied on two mouthfuls of oxygen to condense all the essence of life, and with all his strength, his energy penetrated the rainbow. Every time he recalled that he was kissed wildly by beauties in turn, he couldn&#39;t help laughing out loud. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The last shot of the film shows Val and Doc, each wearing a suit and sunglasses, holding two guns, calmly walking towards the enemy&#39;s armed forces in a building. The final battle is extremely gorgeous and decisive. Johnny Cash&#39;s chant sounded at the right time: I&amp;nbsp;hurt&amp;nbsp;myself&amp;nbsp;today,&amp;nbsp;to&amp;nbsp;see&amp;nbsp;if&amp;nbsp;I&amp;nbsp;still&amp;nbsp;feel.I&amp;nbsp;focus&amp;nbsp;on&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;pain,&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;only&amp;nbsp;thing&amp;nbsp;that&#39;s &amp;nbsp;real .&amp;nbsp;Remembering the rivers and lakes forever and returning to gray hair is indeed a different state, but there are many emotions in life that cannot be let go, and good nights that you are unwilling to walk into. The acting skills of the three actors are flawless, and the viewing experience is like a piece of butter toffee slowly melting in your mouth, which is really enjoyable. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/I2RE2UGpgzmbb42GN3GDdlYXGZODhOMNmY864uGX.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;502&quot; height= &quot;782&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/I2RE2UGpgzmbb42GN3GDdlYXGZODhOMNmY864uGX.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;257532&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>; &quot;Arrival&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&quot;Arrival&quot; is lighter than &quot;Interstellar&quot; - this is of course compared to the latter&#39;s hard science fiction nature. Linguistics as a methodology is like a dagger, prying open the nut shell of the universe. In her study of alien languages, Louise Bank realized the non-linear thinking that is very different from human beings: the movement of everything is not a sequence of dominoes toppling over, but a cycle with no end and no beginning. On a huge dome called destiny, the past, present and future are spread out in her eyes at the same time (the original work by Ted Chiang is called &quot;The Story of Your Life&quot;). This is a sadder superpower than eternal life. She transcended time, but she still couldn&#39;t escape the cause and effect. Louise chose to get married and give birth to a daughter - even though her death was predicted years later. She named her daughter Hannah, a palindrome that means &quot;wandering around without interruption&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A few days ago, I taught students about late Qing poetry. Xie Meiru said in &quot;The Poems of Gambling Villa&quot;: &quot;The style of poetry... although it is extremely clever, it is ultimately beautiful.&quot; Wei Shanboxiang said: Poetry It has a palindrome, just like plum blossoms have wax plum blossoms, but the type does not meet the character.&quot; I deeply understand this statement. However, the wonderful use of &quot;Arrival&quot; probably depends on the aesthetic surprise brought by crossing the boundary and the right amount of ingenuity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/NlY4JnKnOJUi8kCuntOSzjhSUDNJ2C7ztSeYk64r.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;506&quot; height= &quot;760&quot; data-src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/NlY4JnKnOJUi8kCuntOSzjhSUDNJ2C7ztSeYk64r.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;257531&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt; strong>;&quot;Three Billboards&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;My preference for crime themes can be traced back to the 1990s. When I was a child, I watched too many rough and fierce domestic criminal investigation dramas. &quot;Three Billboards&quot; just filled the void I felt after three seasons of &quot;Fargo,&quot; and I realized that it was more than just a meal replacement. Two fires and three letters, the former cuts the story into natural segments, the latter is responsible for changing the trajectory of the characters, and the author of the letter, Sheriff Willoughby, is the white ball that sacrifices his life to hit others. If you want to select &quot;classic letters in movies&quot;, this film can be selected together with &quot;Cape 7&quot;, &quot;Green Book&quot;, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Human nature is so profound and strange that creators are scrambling to take a cup of it. However, it is too difficult for man to defeat God by his cleverness. It&#39;s a common problem for screenwriters or directors to have too much ego. &quot;Two smart heads fighting&quot; movies are the type I dislike the most. From this perspective, the original script of &quot;Three Billboards&quot; can be called a paradigm, or it may directly quote Willoughby&#39;s last words to Mildred: &quot;Like a chess move.&quot; When this narration sounded, the backlight close-up focused on Mildred&#39;s skinny appearance. Veins on the back of the hand. Actresses like Frances McDormand are truly &quot;indispensable&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 10 Nov 2023 10:25:03 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[人类请回答：科幻能否跟上现实的魔幻]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260297]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-10 09:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 11/08/Ys72GFTbx0IzSk18UAKRY3j6VHmTK17O6xJf358f.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/Ys72GFTbx0IzSk18UAKRY3j6VH mTK17O6xJf358f. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;257417&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;October 18, 2023, the main venue of the 81st World Science Fiction Convention-Chengdu Science Fiction Museum, people walk in the &quot;time and space tunnel&quot; &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Xinhua News Agency/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;A problem that has never occurred in 5 million years&lt;/span>; h4>; &lt;p>;It is not easy for Mr. Bryant, an 80-year-old science fiction fan, to travel to Chengdu from Hampshire. He first took a flight from the UK to the Netherlands, transferred in Beijing, and finally arrived in Chengdu. Pidu District, Chengdu City is the venue for the 81st World Science Fiction Convention. The local area is famous for Pixian Doubanjiang. Two years ago, Mr. Bryant voted for Chengdu, China, at the World Science Fiction Convention. In mid-October 2023, he arrived at the appointment and came to mainland China for the first time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although Mr. Bryant has not read the most popular science fiction work in China - Liu Cixin&#39;s &quot;Three-Body&quot; series, nor has he read any Chinese science fiction works, after a few days with Chinese science fiction Face-to-face communication with fans, his interest in this place has gone beyond science fiction. As a lover of cooking, he plans to bring several jars of bean paste and a local cookbook in English when he returns home to study Sichuan cuisine. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the Chengdu Science Museum, which looks like a giant spacecraft and covers an area of ​​nearly 60,000 square meters, people often excitedly share their encounters with him in the WeChat group of science fiction fans on site. At the age of 80, he still has a strong curiosity about the world, which gives young science fiction fans a lot of encouragement. However, the language barrier has become Mr. Bryant&#39;s biggest challenge in participating in this conference. He has participated in 14 World Science Fiction Conventions before, and only 4 of the previous 80 conferences were held in non-English speaking countries. The venue in Chengdu had elements from science fiction movies and TV shows like &quot;Star Trek&quot; and &quot;Doctor Who&quot; that he was familiar with, but the most popular ones were Panda and &quot;The Three-Body Problem.&quot; People often take photos with the &quot;Three-body&quot; stone pillars outside the venue. One of them is engraved with the warning issued by the Three-body monitor about the risk of the destruction of human civilization, &quot;Don&#39;t answer, don&#39;t answer, don&#39;t answer!&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p >;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/09/bn2zGldvjY1sCwDdmlRMKEovx91lUiUKWM1vhFOQ.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;1280&quot; data-src =&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/09/bn2zGldvjY1sCwDdmlRMKEovx91lUiUKWM1vhFOQ.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;257752&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text- align: center;&quot;>;In November 2014, Liu Cixin and Liu Yukun (middle left) were in the same frame at the 5th Chinese Science Fiction Nebula Award Ceremony held in Beijing. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of Li Yibo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When he arrived in Chengdu, Ethan, a software engineer from New York, USA, was about to finish reading &quot;The Three-Body Problem&quot; The first one, for which he temporarily put aside a collection of short African science fiction novels he was reading. At nearly 40 years old, the only Chinese science fiction work he had read before was &quot;The Story of Your Life&quot; by Ted Chiang (the original work of the movie &quot;Arrival&quot;). This time, the Chengdu Organizing Committee provided benefits such as travel assistants, transportation, Hugo Awards, and opening ceremony viewing quotas for science fiction fans who came from 3,000 kilometers away. However, Ethan believes that many European and American science fiction fans have given up on attending the conference remotely. Obviously, &quot;there are language barriers, there are few direct flights, air tickets are expensive, and you need to transfer in other countries.&quot; He said that science fiction fans in Europe and the United States are mainly middle-aged and elderly, and traveling for more than ten hours will be very hard. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In December 2021, the 79th World Science Fiction Convention was held in Washington, USA. The Ethan family witnessed the success of Chengdu Science Fiction. This process was full of twists and turns. “At that time, there were many discussions about whether the conference should be held in China, such as whether it could comply with conference traditions, voting formats, cultural differences, etc. Of course, the current political situation is also very complicated,” he said. In the travel warning to China issued by the U.S. State Department at the end of June 2023, mainland China was listed as a &quot;third-level&quot; travel destination, calling on U.S. citizens to &quot;reconsider whether to go.&quot; After hesitating for a month or two, Ethan finally decided to come to mainland China to take a look. When he said this, we were sitting around a table eating butter hotpot. Several other sci-fi fans attending the meeting were from Russia, Canada and Indonesia. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/09/jEkakaNGNzaoKw0NJjQQ9UMV6ivOVdf7ZMZ7Kao0.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;2880&quot; height= &quot;1958&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/09/jEkakaNGNzaoKw0NJjQQ9UMV6ivOVdf7ZMZ7Kao0.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;257751&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On July 26, 1999, Liu Cixin attended the &quot;Science Fiction World&quot; PEN Conference in Chengdu. At this time, he was participating in a PEN discussion with his new work &quot;The Wandering Earth&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The organizing committee has previously announced a set of data as of August 31: In addition to members of the World Science Fiction Association who enjoy offline participation rights, non-Chinese participants who purchased offline participation packages There were 51 people, accounting for 1% of the total number of people who purchased offline package tickets. There were 3,908 Chinese citizens who purchased offline package tickets, most of whom were attending the conference for the first time - including Xiami. Xiami, who is in his early 30s, is a physics teacher at a university in Xiamen, Fujian. In 2003, Xiami, who was in the second grade of junior high school, read novels by Wang Jinkang, Liu Cixin and others in a borrowed magazine &quot;Science Fiction World&quot;, and &quot;officially entered the pit of science fiction.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, let Xiami prepare What makes him feel disappointed is that although the venue is large, the area and number of science fiction fan exhibition areas are far less than he expected. Afterwards, Xiami was very sorry to hear that Ethan brought the board game with him but could not find a suitable venue or playmate. After college, he mainly devoted his energy to theoretical research. &quot;This conference is like going back to the pit to take a look.&quot; There is a long &quot;tail&quot; on Xiami&#39;s participation card - if you participate in the booth activities, you will have the opportunity to obtain a booth. Homemade creative ribbons, which are traditional peripherals at science fiction conventions. During the second half of the conference, Xiami turned to the salon of new generation writers. His notebook was filled with notes about the creation of science fiction novels, and his suitcase also contained more than a dozen novels by new generation writers. He is ready to restart the dream he had in high school - to write science fiction. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, with the rapid changes in reality, can science fiction still provide people with enough strangeness and surprise, and can science fiction creation keep up with the magic of reality? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/09/sd1AP8gnUYwcVFgmbA2gVB8c6qU0QtiFMtE3tCkL.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;624&quot; height= &quot;558&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/09/sd1AP8gnUYwcVFgmbA2gVB8c6qU0QtiFMtE3tCkL.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;257753&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The Hague, Netherlands, August 1990, Yang Xiao (second from left) with famous American science fiction writer Harry Harrison (first from left) and British science fiction master Brian Aldis The couple attended the WFS annual meeting together. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Now, reality and science fiction do have a competitive relationship.&quot; Science fiction writer Han Song said. Sometimes he serves as a judge for science fiction awards and finds that some science fiction works are not as surprising and strange as reality. &quot;Reality is more like an alien world.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The 58-year-old Han Song is the leader of the external editorial department of Xinhua News Agency , is also a science fiction writer. Before arriving at the venue, he had already published a rather optimistic report on Xinhua News Agency, &quot;Embracing Science Fiction, Creating Tomorrow.&quot; For more than thirty years, he spent the day writing, editing and distributing news reports for the world at the Xinhua News Agency building on Xuanwumen West Street in Beijing. He got up at three or four in the morning to write science fiction before going to work. In 2018, he finished writing the science fiction novel &quot;Hospital&quot; trilogy. A few years later, when the COVID-19 pandemic hit the world, many people turned to his novels to contrast the visions of reality. Han Song continued to compile and publish reports on the COVID-19 epidemic. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1939, the first World Science Fiction Convention was held in New York, USA, reflecting that in the 20th century when the theory of relativity and quantum mechanics appeared, the evolution of human civilization entered a new stage, &quot;another turning point has been reached.&quot; Han Song He said, &quot;Quantum mechanics and the theory of relativity have appeared in the past 100 years. All the material foundations we have today are laid by these two theories. In these 100 years, humans have created weapons that can destroy themselves and other life on the earth. This is 500 years of human evolution.&quot; A phenomenon that has never happened in ten thousand years. Now we have nuclear weapons, artificial intelligence, nanotechnology, and life technology.&quot; One of the meanings of the existence of science fiction is to face these problems. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many salons at this science fiction conference talked about artificial intelligence, controllable nuclear fusion, quantum computing and communications. More than 80 years after the birth of nuclear weapons, some countries have used controllable nuclear fusion technology to solve the earth&#39;s energy problems. During the conference, science fiction writers were invited to the Southwest Institute of Physics of the CNNC Nuclear Industry to visit the nuclear fusion device known as the &quot;artificial sun&quot; - China Gyre 3, a new generation of artificial sun - which was selected for the &quot;Annual Science Fiction Plan&quot;. 74-year-old science fiction writer Wang Jinkang stood in front of the &quot;artificial sun&quot; and observed. As a senior engineer specializing in internal combustion engines, he once used nuclear energy to build a new path from the earth to outer space in science fiction novels. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Han Song, who also came to visit, immediately conducted an interview and wrote a report &quot;Science Fiction Writer Approaches &quot;Artificial Sun&quot;&quot;. The two-story ring-shaped device is covered with colorful pipelines and surrounded by instruments and computers. The nuclear fusion device looks like a giant monster. Most of the scientists explaining it on site are women. Han Song immediately thought of &quot;Frankenstein&quot; written by the British writer Mary Shelley in 1818, which was the first modern science fiction novel in human history. &quot;Science fiction was created by women.&quot; He was also thinking about his own science fiction. If controllable nuclear fusion solves the energy crisis of the entire earth, and if everyone on the earth has equal access to so much energy, will families and marriages disappear? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Han Song’s view, science fiction is a species literature. &quot;Sometimes literature is the spiritual history of a nation, but science fiction is literature that describes the human species as an object.&quot; He feels that this is the meaning of every science fiction conference, &quot;So you will always be curious and want to know the same things as us What do these people think when faced with the same technology and the same proposition?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23 /11/08/sST6wtu8xTS4xm5jtKpTe6CO7qz7SZH8ENsufAnh.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/sST6wtu8xTS4xm5jtKpTe6CO7qz7SZH8EN sufAnh .jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;257415&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On October 18, 2023, at the theme exhibition of the 2023 Chengdu World Science Fiction Conference, Audiences are choosing sci-fi IP peripheral products &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Xinhua News Agency/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Science Fiction Literature of the World&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In 1990, In order to save money, Ms. Yang Xiao took an 8-day and 8-night train across Eurasia to attend the annual meeting of the International Science Fiction Association (WSF) in The Hague, Netherlands.

They dragged a large box of the achievements of Sichuan science fiction literature and gifts with panda elements, and once again fought for the right to host the 1991 WSF Annual Conference in Chengdu. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In May of the previous year, as the editor-in-chief of &quot;Science and Literature&quot;, Yang Xiao went to the WSF Annual Conference held in San Marino alone. Twenty or thirty people sat in a small conference room to discuss the most popular science fiction topics in the world. &quot;We are talking about atmospheric pollution, human beings&#39; position in space, low-temperature life support, flying into space...&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Chinese science fiction is taking off, and Chinese teenagers like science fiction very much.&quot; She said at the meeting Said repeatedly. Her English was not very good. During the defense, she held two small volumes of &quot;A Concise Chinese-English Dictionary&quot; and &quot;A Concise English-Chinese Dictionary&quot; and wrote down the translations from English to Chinese and then from Chinese to English. However, she finally won the 1991 award for Chengdu. The right to host the WSF annual meeting. Others present said she &quot;With a little English and lots of determination to do a lot of things (with a little English and lots of determination to do a lot of things)&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, this decision was later overturned, and the host country for the 1991 meeting would be re-voted at the 1990 WSF Annual Meeting. This time, Yang Xiao and his team were well prepared, answered various questions and doubts, and showed off the achievements of Chinese science fiction and the cute appearance of pandas. At the end of the discussion at the meeting, Brian Aldiss, the leader of the British New Wave Science Fiction Movement and one of the founders of WSF, stood up. His words always meant what he said, and he, who was always gentle, said seriously and solemnly: &quot;Political disputes are just temporary. Yes, the dialogue and understanding between East and West are long-term, and the friendship between people is eternal. We should not follow political trends.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the 1980s, Aldis and Chinese science fiction writers Zheng Wenguang has correspondence. Zheng Wenguang was born in 1929 and was a researcher at the Beijing Observatory of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. In 1957, Zheng Wenguang&#39;s novel &quot;The Builders of Mars&quot; won the award at the World Youth Festival in Moscow. This was the first Chinese science fiction work to win an award abroad. Once, after receiving a letter from Zheng Wenguang and his new book &quot;Selected Works of Zheng Wenguang&quot;, Aldis expressed surprise at the title of the book in his reply. Is it really called that? This kind of name won&#39;t sell to us. For this collection, we have to pick the most interesting novel in it as the title. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In May 1991, in Chengdu, China, at the annual meeting of the International Science Fiction Professional Association, 66-year-old Aldis and 62-year-old Zheng Wenguang reunited. At that time, Zheng Wenguang was already in a wheelchair, and Ordis Dees helped push his wheelchair on every occasion. Also present that year were American science fiction writer Frederic Bohr and others. This annual meeting also invited Wu Yan, a scholar who teaches science fiction creation courses in colleges and universities, and others, and was full of encouragement for young creators. In order to invite Han Song, a student of Wuhan University, to join, Tan Kai, the editor-in-chief of &quot;Science Fiction World&quot; wrote a letter To Qi Minyou, the president of Wuhan University and mathematician whom he did not know, Qi quickly approved and funded 400 yuan for room and board expenses. At the meeting, Han Song showed the &quot;Cosmic Tombstone&quot; that had been rejected earlier to the Taiwanese scholar Lu Yingzhong who was present. Lu Yingzhong took it to Taiwan and gave it to the writers Zhang Xiguo and Zhang Dachun. In the end, this novel won the World Chinese Science Fiction and Literature Award in 1991. prize. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/hmnGcAFANFyUPNgruABWm91w6vPdBiLhUwF4ADWP.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;634&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/hmnGcAFANFyUPNgruABWm91w6vPdBiLhUwF4ADWP.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;257416&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On October 18, 2023, at the theme exhibition of the 2023 Chengdu World Science Fiction Conference, visitors watched the robot &quot;Silence&quot; playing drums&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa; &quot;>;(Xinhua News Agency/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After this annual science fiction conference that connected many people, Chinese science fiction is back on track. &quot;Science and Literature&quot;, founded in 1979, was renamed &quot;Science Fiction World&quot; in the same year, and later successively published science fiction novels by new authors Wang Jinkang, Han Song, He Xi, and Liu Cixin - now they have become the &quot;Four Kings&quot; of Chinese science fiction. . During a collective visit to Dujiangyan at the annual meeting, 23-year-old Han Song asked an old foreigner how to write about political themes in world science fiction. He later learned that this man was Aldis. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“He has been here twice and always talks very enthusiastically about the people he knows and what is happening in the science fiction world. He also very much hopes that Chinese science fiction works can get more recognition, which is also the case for him. The reason why he is keen to hold that science fiction annual conference. There is always a photo of him and Yang Xiao in his study, which is very important to him.&quot; At the 2023 Chengdu World Science Fiction Conference, Aldis&#39;s daughter Wen Di Aldis told me that this afternoon she completed two salon conversations with Yang Xiao. Mr. Aldis has been dead for six years now. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When he arrived in Chengdu in 1991, Aldis was upset that a piece of luggage was lost when he transferred before arriving in Chengdu. It was a small box of science fiction books given to the editorial department of &quot;Science Fiction World&quot;. Wendy brought a large pile of her father&#39;s books with her this time and placed them on the salon table during the event. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some of the things in Aldis&#39;s book have become reality. Aldis&#39;s most famous work is &quot;Jungle Greenhouse&quot;, which has been serialized in the British &quot;Fantasy and Science Fiction&quot; since 1961. He constructed a &quot;post-Earth era&quot; in which intelligent plants dominate the earth. At that time, the earth was already a The huge greenhouse that stopped rotating formed a stable system with the moon. The plants reaching the sky extended their branches and leaves to the moon where flying people lived. The movie &quot;Artificial Intelligence&quot; directed by Steven Spielberg is adapted from Aldous&#39;s &quot;Super Toys That Lasted All Summer.&quot; The novel is poetic and melancholy, about a robot with human emotions who doesn&#39;t want the humans who raised him to discover that he already knows he is a robot. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Aldis’s works are full of reflections on modern civilization. In fact, British science fiction literature, which was born in 1818, is a product of the technological revolution and the industrial revolution. This literary genre, which appeared very late compared to other literary genres, originally had two visions for creating modern society: one is Utopia, a true and false travelogue that originated in the Age of Discovery; the other is the idea that human beings will continue to progress. , a narrative that gradually took shape with the Enlightenment and the French Revolution, and has had a profound impact on human thought around the world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Chinese science fiction literature was born along with enlightenment modernity. At the beginning of the 20th century, Lu Xun translated science fiction novels (called &quot;science novels&quot; at the time) such as &quot;Travel to the Moon&quot;, &quot;Travel to the Underground&quot; and &quot;The Art of Creation&quot;. At the same time, more and more famous writers have joined in the translation or creation of science fiction literature. At that time, most participants in science fiction literature longed for the changes in the times brought about by technological progress, and explored various possibilities for the future of mankind and the world. After the founding of New China, the first batch of science fiction writers in New China such as Zheng Wenguang appeared. Their science fiction novels assumed part of the responsibility of popularizing science. The positive attitude towards modernity in Chinese science fiction at the beginning of the last century was continued to a certain extent. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/2qy1dSFciYTRFgg47ZjOeSRntGsa4z5AfmsRDNBb.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/2qy1dSFciYTRFgg47ZjOeSRntGsa4z5AfmsRDNBb.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;257418&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On October 17, 2023, a drone performance next to the main venue of the Chengdu Science Fiction Conference&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/ span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the West, where the modernization process was earlier, there has always been no shortage of science fiction works that are wary of modern civilization. Even in the first modern science fiction novel &quot;Frankenstein&quot;, there is already a Scientific doubt. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When humans can develop weapons to destroy the earth and launch wars to exterminate species, mature works that reflect on modernity also appear outside Western countries. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1964, the year Japan hosted the Olympic Games, Japanese science fiction writer Sakyo Komatsu began writing &quot;The Sinking of Japan&quot;. This novel, which took nine years to be written, caused a sensation in Japanese society after it was published. The novel describes the Japanese archipelago being destroyed by the earth&#39;s crust. Big changes and sinking to the bottom of the sea. Japan&#39;s postwar economic miracle made Komatsu Sakyo deeply worried. He was worried about people&#39;s consumption of large amounts of resources and energy, and their tense and conflicting relationship with nature and society. He also showed great compassion and sympathy for the fate of mankind. &quot;Japanese science fiction has a great influence on me. As for &quot;The Three-Body Problem&quot; specifically, it was actually greatly influenced by &quot;The Sinking of Japan&quot;. I was shocked after watching &quot;The Sinking of Japan&quot;. A science fiction work can actually reveal the deepest depths of a nation. The sensitive and fragile fear of the future is reflected.&quot; Liu Cixin once said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Like Sakyo Komatsu, Japanese science fiction writer Hoshi Shinichi was active in the second half of the 20th century. His short story &quot;Hey! &quot;Come Out&quot; was included in Chinese language textbooks in the early 21st century. Many domestic middle school students read this type of story in their textbooks for the first time. In the novel, a bottomless pit suddenly appeared on the earth. Human beings discovered that the hole was endless, so they dumped all the garbage and pollutants they produced into it without any scruples. Later, when all the endless destruction and desires of mankind were sprayed back to the ground and returned to mankind, what served as a harbinger was the innocent and ignorant cry of mankind when they discovered this hole, &quot;Hey - come out!&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt; p>;In 2007, the World Science Fiction Convention came to Asia for the first time. In Yokohama, Japan, at the opening ceremony of the 65th World Science Fiction Conference, 76-year-old Sakyo Komatsu appeared in a wheelchair. He was the first person to introduce Japanese and even Asian science fiction to the world. &quot;More than half a century ago, he was like a prophet, predicting that scientific progress does not necessarily make people happy. He expressed human pain, revealed the barbarism of human nature, and at the same time placed hope and light.&quot; Han Song likes Sakyo Komatsu very much, That year, he went to Yokohama to attend a science fiction conference with writer and scholar Wu Yan, &quot;Science Fiction World&quot; president Qin Li, and editor-in-chief Yao Haijun. Komatsu Sakyo was very happy to see them. He held Han Song&#39;s hand and said repeatedly in Chinese, &quot;Thank you, thank you so much.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“The times have caught up”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In 2023, the World Science Fiction Convention will come to Asia for the second time. At the Chengdu World Science Fiction Convention, whenever Liu Cixin is present, he always attracts the cheers and attention of the audience like a magnet. Even if he is not a guest on the spot, his name and &quot;Three-Body Problem&quot; are unavoidable topics in the salon for guests from all over the world. As China&#39;s most famous science fiction writer, Liu Cixin&#39;s autograph session was specially arranged by the organizing committee for three hours, starting at 2:30 p.m. However, just after 11 a.m. that day, there was already a long queue in the autograph hall. In the past, Liu Cixin insisted on signing the last reader in line every time he signed. This time he signed for three hours. His hands were shaking when he signed, and he wanted to persist, but was stopped by the organizer. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/nabBdy5qmcBucAUx3G7IUI6wHYmPB9UT7Ll5xaKO.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/nabBdy5qmcBucAUx3G7IUI6wHYmPB9UT7Ll5xaKO.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;257419&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On October 21, 2023, in Chengdu, Sichuan, &quot;The Painter of Time and Space&quot; created by Chinese writer Hai Ming (middle) won the Hugo Award for Best Short Novella&lt;span style= &quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Xinhua News Agency/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2015, &quot;The Three-Body Problem&quot; won the 73rd Hugo Award for Best Novel, and Liu Cixin became the first Asian writers who have won this award. Today, 60-year-old Liu Cixin has become one of China&#39;s most famous writers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At this science fiction conference venue, there is a white sculpture about 9 meters high in the most conspicuous position in the atrium. The prototype is the lunar robot mechanical dog &quot;Benben&quot; in &quot;The Wandering Earth 2&quot;. There are many people taking pictures around Benben. It is the most representative product image in the &quot;Wandering Earth&quot; IP licensing business. &quot;The Wandering Earth 2&quot;, adapted from Liu Cixin&#39;s novel of the same name, has a cumulative box office of 4.029 billion yuan in mainland China and a global box office of US$598 million. It will also represent mainland China in the competition for Best International Film at the 96th Academy Awards. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before becoming a famous writer, Liu Cixin worked as an engineer at a power plant in a small town called &quot;Niangziguan&quot; in Yangquan City, Shanxi Province. After he became famous, the town was visited by many news reporters.本届科幻大会的一系列活动中，刘慈欣在一场主题为“工程师科幻”的沙龙中展现出难得的放松和尽兴，“现实中再困难的事情，在小说中都能解决，不费吹灰之力。难就难在曲折的技术建构，如何把最疯狂的想象、最缥缈的超级技术用最有实感的细节写出来，让读者就像在看新闻报道和历史记录那般真实。”他钟爱工程师科幻的独特美学，渴望自己能做到，也渴望在别人的作品中读到。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“随着各大陆资源的枯竭和环境的恶化，世界把目光投向南极洲……但人类的理智在另一方面取得了胜利，全球彻底销毁核武器的最后进程开始了，随着全球无核化的实现，人类对南极大陆的争夺变得安全了一些。”刘慈欣于2003年发表在《科幻世界》的短篇小说《地球大炮》是虾米的入坑之作。小说贯穿着一种镇定和坚毅：政府建造了一条从漠河穿过地心直达南极的隧道。这项超级工程因灾难性事故而被封闭。此后全球环境进一步恶化，人类为寻找出路，决意把地球上的工业转移到太空。隧道被重新启用，人类在其中加上磁铁线圈，利用地心引力和安培力把地球变成了“地球大炮”，得以低成本地把地表物品抛送到近地轨道。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;第一次读到这个构想恢弘的故事时，还在读初二的虾米便感受到了与其他文学作品迥异的刺激和惊喜，“我一下就被那种新奇的设定和宏大的史诗感击中。”从此《科幻世界》成了虾米的每月必读刊物。到了2006年，虾米在《科幻世界》读到刚开始连载的《三体》，当科幻迷们津津乐道地分析《三体》中的物理设定时，没有人能预见这部小说将把中国科幻引向什么样的未来。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/8LvrxC3JN96XASg4oy696aVY9Mjn9dJeNjAcQzbQ.jpg&quot;

&lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;成都世界科幻大会的一场沙龙间隙，布莱恩特先生向本刊记者展示他自制的塑封卡片，里面是他参加的过往14届世界科幻大会证件的集锦。 80岁的他表示自己回家后，会将本次的参会感想和建议通过邮件分享给主办方。 “十年后如果中国再次举办世界科幻大会，我希望自己还能来参加”&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（南方人物周刊记者陈洋/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;刘慈欣写《三体》第三部期间，曾在杭州参加了一次科幻作家笔会。大家聊“如果要把杭州彻底毁灭，应该用什么方法”，他一激动，说可以先把城市二维化，变成一幅水墨山水，再一维化，成为一根细细的丝线。大家听了都很兴奋。酒醒之后，刘慈欣很紧张。还好没有人挪用这个科幻构想。二向箔正是于2010年出版的《三体III:死神永生》中最令人惊艳的宇宙规律武器之一。它的能力是降维攻击，将三维坍缩成二维。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;《三体III》出版的2010年，随着智能手机和4G网络的普及，中国从PC互联网时代跨入移动互联网时代。小米和美团在这一年成立，微信在次年推出。小米创始人雷军在2010年看完《三体》后又推荐给其他企业家，并多次公开谈及《三体》的“降维攻击”“黑暗森林”对互联网战略的启发。 《三体》系列收获了科幻圈的推崇，而这些互联网新贵们的讨论则令这部作品打破圈层，真正进入大众视野。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;科幻在一个地区的发展需要现实土壤，这在其他国家早已得到验证。 19世纪，英法科幻文学受益于工业革命而发展，以凡尔纳、威尔斯为代表。二战后，以美国为代表的西方科幻文学进入鼎盛期。而日本科幻的高速发展时期是1970-80 年代，1970 年代的日本缔造了经济快速发展的“日本奇迹”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;经过美籍华裔作家刘宇昆翻译，英文版《三体》在2014年开始传播。 Facebook创始人扎克伯格称《三体》“把我从最近所读过的经济、社会、科学书籍中解脱出来，令我感到轻松愉悦”。时任美国总统奥巴马看完《三体》后，“觉得当个美国总统和浩瀚的宇宙相比实在太渺小了。毕竟每天处理的都是和国会争论的琐事，不用担心外星人入侵。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2022年，《三体》英文版权续约金高达125万美元，创下中国文学作品海外版权输出的最高纪录。美国流媒体订阅平台奈飞制作的《三体》剧集将于2024年登上荧幕。 “中国科幻就是国际传播非常成功的例子，不是说花了多少钱，不是一定要生硬地往世界推广。我觉得中国科幻是向世界学习，把世界科幻好的东西跟中国的传统文化和现代文化融合，打上了很强的中国烙印，再让世界去感受中国人的科幻。中国科幻面对世界的普遍性问题，比如环境、太空、战争等等问题，提出了中国式的解答，让世界感受到这个解答是有价值的、独一无二的，能够给世界带来意想不到的收获和惊喜。”韩松说。 &lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;这位科幻作家在与科技竞赛。刘慈欣一直保持着阅读前沿科技文章的习惯。他习惯于在大脑精准建模之后，再“一鼓作气写出来”。 2015年，他在接受《三联生活周刊》采访时提到自己之前构思了整整两年的一个“好点子”，这个题材曾被他寄予厚望，不仅设定留有很大的发挥空间，他在电力系统工作的经历也可以帮助他刻画丰满的人物形象。直到有一天，他看到一篇由日本早稻田大学的研究者发表的文章。对方不仅提出了同样的想法，还“算出了总的发电功率”，并提出“在拉格朗日点建立中继站把微波送回来”等等。看完这篇文章，刘慈欣彻底放弃了这个构想，已经写好的30万字手稿就此尘封。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;刘慈欣将新作品发布的门槛设定为“能让自己兴奋起来”，并强调自己“一直在努力”，但阻力也前所未有。 “经常是刚开始写时觉得很震撼，写到一半却发现时代已经追上来了，连自己都觉得很无聊了，于是重新开始写，时间就这么浪费过去了。”刘慈欣对我说。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“科技的飞速发展削弱了科学的神奇感以及人对科学可能创造的未来的期冀，这对传统类型的科幻小说的打击很大。”他认为这是像他一样“依托于创意和世界建构”的硬科幻作家的共同难题，“东西方的同行都在努力，希望用更多的表现手法来恢复科幻创作的活力。但坦率说，目前效果并不好。”他甚至有些后悔，觉得自己早年间发表的三十多个中短篇小说是对题材的过度挥霍，耗完了激情。而未来，随着科幻故事的表达载体从小说转向荧幕，他也担忧自己是否能适应角色变化。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“我能写作的时间，最多也就是10年左右了。”刘慈欣觉得让这场倒计时加速的还有人工智能，“ChatGPT写出的科幻小说越来越好，我不知道人工智能给我们，至少给我还留下多少时间。”他认为这是自然规律，不能算悲观。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/Wrcopdeg1Rje5L3q25kA1Nx59Wac2G1ngtXZXmAt.jpg&quot;

&lt;p>;“那时候所有的行星都还在冷战呢，他回忆到，将死的心中荡起一丝转瞬即逝的兴奋。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;韩松低低的声音念着自己在30年前写的《冷战与信使》，这是本届科幻大会唯一的读书活动。他觉得这是一个爱情小说，“两代人，政治，战争，男权，女权。人在时空中的卑微。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这篇小说是科幻作家糖匪坚持选的，她觉得很适合多地发生局部冲突的当下。一位来中国参会的美国科幻迷在出发前被公司禁止携带电脑。特拉维夫国际科幻电影节的创办人乌里·阿维夫来自巴以冲突的战乱地区。等大会结束，他又要回到屡遭空袭的以色列特拉维夫。特拉维夫国际科幻电影节将于12月开幕。一些工作人员被征召入伍，许多工作面临调整。 “我们肩头的责任比以往任何时候都更重，科幻作品能为人们提供平静和治愈的力量，帮助他们在对当下和时代的忧虑重压下喘一口气，得以思考、构想和期待更美好的未来。”一个小时的读书中，活动现场挤满了人，竟有人听得落下泪来。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;人类不得不直面这充满不确定的现实。韩松原本想在读书会上展开读糖匪的新书《后来的人类》，甚至准备了三段内容，分别对应着设定架构、机器、关系。小说构建了一种未来的新型公寓，人工智能“家庭主脑”控制着公寓的一切，以无所不用其极的方式来照顾人类，实际却是一个监视者，甚至成了统治者。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;尽管新生代的科幻作家对外部世界的描写更加多元和令人兴奋，也更广阔，但韩松觉得科幻文学目前还需要更大的想象力。此外，他觉得女性作家写得更细致，有时候写得更深刻，“不仅体现在对情感的了解，还有对历史和社会的认知。”他觉得反映社会问题最好的作品之一就是郝景芳的《北京折叠》（获雨果奖），慕明和双翅目的作品也有很强的社会风格，技术后面有很强的历史和社会认知。 “但有些男作家写现实就显得有点着急，我觉得比较粗线条。不一定写到这样的主题，就算写到了，小说到他技术惊奇的画面那里就截止了。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这场科幻大会的几天之前，韩松赶去浙江绍兴参加了一场中日作家的交流会，与会者有多位芥川奖得主和鲁迅文学奖得主。会议特意选在了鲁迅的出生地举办，鲁迅是最早把科幻小说译介到中国的人之一。这一场交流会谈论的问题，成为世界科幻大会探讨的许多内容的预演。这些东亚作家首次一起深入讨论人工智能时代的文学到底是什么、人类在新技术条件下生活的意义。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;每一场科技革命都会引起欢呼和惊恐，人工智能的发展也不例外。但全球对人工智能产生全面的紧张感是从2022年底ChatGPT的发布开始的。有观点认为，随着以AI为代表的智能化生产方式的出现和普及，第五次工业革命正在发生。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/NU9S1x16GXPBcpUGJvCJ4bSdryw9zxnrhlcEFa70.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;409&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/NU9S1x16GXPBcpUGJvCJ4bSdryw9zxnrhlcEFa70.jpg&quot;

&lt;p>;“反倒是科幻小说，对未来人工智能做了方方面面的预测性描述。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;近年写人工智能和元宇宙的科幻小说变得非常多，而且将未来建模得相当详细。最近，韩松读到墨熊的新小说就是写后人类时代，全球人工智能挽救人类，让人类能在整个宇宙演化的灾难中继续生存，最后的办法是人与机器融合的怪物更替了人类这一物种。科幻作家江波近几年也写了很多人工智能。 “他还是很悲观地认为人和机器的战争是很难避免的。写共生的也有，人机耦合也写过，但我还是觉得不可预测。”韩松说。 &lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;韩松的“医院三部曲”在2018年全部出版，这个系列由《医院》《驱魔》《亡灵》组成，也想象了人工智能：“药时代”里，医药成了新的神；“药战争”接替了全球“核战争”；在医药战争中，整个宇宙也像病人一样走向死亡，而不得已遭遇所有故事的，不过是一个因为喝了坏水而被送进医院的可怜上班族。书中的忧思最初只在学界传播，哈佛大学教授王德威在参加北京大学纪念“五四”运动百年活动演讲时，指出韩松的“医院三部曲”重启了早期鲁迅对科学与文学的批判性思考。到2020年全球暴发新冠疫情时，一些人找到韩松的这套《医院》，来对照眼前惊人的生活。 “在社会发展、生活逐渐繁荣的同时，每个人内心深处都有一层伤口。生活凭靠运气，下一步怎么活下去没有把握。许多担忧与无力交织在人心里，内化成心底的巨大惧怕。”2017年，刚写完《驱魔》的韩松对我说。 &lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;2014年，我在新华社对外部实习时，想做一篇北京地铁的报道，我的实习老师建议我采访部门领导韩松，并读一读他的短篇小说《地铁惊变》。韩松每天上班来得很早，总是拍下1号线首班地铁中乘客的样子。我还记得自己在韩松楼下办公室读完《地铁惊变》后因惊栗而久久无法动弹的状态，那是我第一次看见熟悉的现实在科幻中的扭曲和变形。他又写了《高铁》《轨道》，和《地铁》组成“轨道三部曲”。他写那些在新闻中总以进步和繁荣之姿出现的技术，“新闻成为世界的镜子就很不容易了，讽刺小说是一面哈哈镜，科幻像个万花筒。 ”韩松拿这个万花筒看高铁，看科技、经济、政治。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/tB0lwOu8v6XckTtxN2P0coIdYQ3oRWS93K3dlo5E.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/tB0lwOu8v6XckTtxN2P0coIdYQ3oRWS93K3dlo5E.jpg&quot;

&lt;p>;韩松编发过很多灾难报道。2008年汶川地震发生时，新华社第一个向世界报道了震级，“整个晚上，我们特别难过的，是不断地编发了一所一所学校倒塌的新闻，大批的学生被埋在下面。学校，还是学校……”在那个书山一样的办公室，韩松依然写新闻或科幻，又过了两年，他交了科幻小说《再生砖》：大地震后，建筑师用废墟瓦砾、麦秸和死尸制造了新型建筑材料。在艺术展斩获国际大奖后，再生砖被大规模生产并在灾区和全国推广，再生砖风靡世界，带动灾区振兴，人类聆听和赞美砖头里亡灵的哭声。人类如此迷恋再生砖，以致记不住任何教训，甚至去外星球播撒人造微生物来制造新灾难，最后发现，宇宙本身就是一块由废墟和生命建成的再生砖。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;对韩松来说，是科幻作家叶永烈带来了科幻的火种。叶永烈的《小灵通漫游未来》在1978年出版后很轰动，“中国人之前沉浸在人与人的斗争中，很久没有想象未来时空了。 ”他觉得叶永烈最了不起的科幻小说，自己至今也无法超越的，还是那篇《巴金的梦》，发表在1980年代的《科幻世界》。“他写中国未来一定会建这么一个牢记历史的博物馆，而且是与国际合建，他详细描写了这个馆怎么建，有什么馆藏。这个小说光是能发表就很了不起了。 ”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;同时，叶永烈对未来是乐观的。他是《十万个为什么》的主要作者，又写了《小灵通漫游未来》。他在20世纪60年代写了21世纪的中国，有生产粮食的工厂，有给学生上课的机器人，有电脑的普及，有人造肉、人工控制天气，还有会飞行的汽车等等，向那个年代的小读者描绘出一个充满希望与光明的未来。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/f2PQXd1rD7H5R46OwmYvzhxi19L7hOPSZmUtXG9f.jpg&quot;

&lt;p>;熙熙攘攘的会场、沙龙和展厅，都在彰显科幻的“热”。但作为文化产业的一部分，国内科幻产业的发展仍在起步期。据“IT桔子”的数据，2022年国内文娱行业有投融资事件88起，涉及投资金额46.36亿元，数量和金额创近5年新低。据《证券日报》不完全统计，截至2023年9月14日，该年国内文娱行业（含传媒、游戏、元宇宙、社交、体育）共发生13起投融资事件。而2022年国内文娱领域投融资事件为96起，2019年该数据为2158起。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;科幻文化品牌“未来事务管理局”（以下简称“未来局”）创始人姬少亭是第三次参与世界科幻大会，此前两次分别在英国伦敦和芬兰赫尔辛基。许多西方参会者向她提起他们的惊讶发现——中国科幻迷群体的年轻化和较高的女性占比。海外科幻的发展历程较长，科幻迷大多是中老年。收获同行惊羡的同时，姬少亭心里思考的却是另一个问题，从青年到白头，这些西方读者为何能数十年保持对科幻的热爱？答案很明确。 “他们一定是被持续投喂了大量优秀的作品，这意味着有创作热情的人才在源源不断地涌入科幻行业。归根结底是因为这个行业体量足够大，足够提供就业和发展的强大支撑。”&lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;2016年，姬少亭离开工作10年的新华社，创立未来局，开始深度参与到科幻产业发展。七年来，未来局已成为国内主要的科幻IP开发方之一，参与了众多图书、影视、游戏、玩具等行业科幻IP项目的开发和策划。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2019年1月，未来局举办了《流浪地球》的第一个观影会，导演郭帆和刘慈欣第一次在电影院完整地看成片。映后，姬少亭十分坚定地对我说，这部电影肯定会火的。这部电影被认为“开启了中国科幻电影元年”，票房和效应超出预期，并给电影行业带来巨大的启示。 《流浪地球》在中国大陆票房累计达46.88亿元，全球票房7.39亿美元。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;然而，影视行业对科幻题材的理解整体还处于初级阶段。同时，受累于羸弱的投资环境，科幻影视的市场化步履蹒跚。据阿里影业总裁李捷2023年4月在一场创投大会上介绍，阿里影业的科幻电影创投，10到15个项目中，进入成片阶段的只有1到2部。在同一场活动中，《流浪地球》《宇宙探索编辑部》的监制王红卫则勉励科幻创作者“咬住牙”，“我希望以后一年起码有一部高质量的科幻作品，能够再撑住我们这个类型。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“《流浪地球》系列的成功反映出国内对优秀科幻作品需求惊人，需求和供给之间的巨大沟壑就是行业的机遇所在。对于具体的公司、事和人，机遇是肯定存在的，就看谁能把握住。好的作品是一切。”姬少亭说。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;近几年，由于发表渠道和推广资源收紧，姬少亭明显感觉推进一件事的阻力要比过去大得多。 “经济面临下行压力，各个环节都缺钱，变得保守，不愿试错，资金和资源会向顶级作者和作品集中。当然，这更有利于实现单点突破，弊端则在于新人出头和成长的机会在缩减。”未来局在成立那年就启动了科幻写作培训，致力于持续培养并帮助新兴科幻作者成长。姬少亭常被问道，什么时候才会出现下一个刘慈欣，“我真正希望看到的局面是大量中等以上作品的出现。如果我们连金字塔的地基都不扎实，没有足够庞大的基数，要如何期待下一个刘慈欣呢？”&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;淡蓝的小点&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;吴文琛重返科幻的世界，是因为《流浪地球》。 2019年上映时，他和妻子、儿子一起去影院看了这部电影。现在，他11岁的儿子在写一个科幻小说。吴文琛小时候也看《科幻世界》，写科幻小说的念头倒是从来没有过。当年《科幻世界》每页的最下边是读者栏目，刊登读者的一句话想象和地址，来稿的多是中学生。吴文琛在中学时也投过稿，还在《科幻世界》发表了一句对世界的好奇和想象，那像是人在少年时对宇宙的呐喊。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这次从成都市中心来郫都参加科幻大会，就是儿子拉他过来的。上高中后，他再也没读过科幻，后来工作、开公司，生活工作连轴转。看到台上坐着创办《科幻世界》的编辑们，他一下被刺激到，在互动环节举手，几乎不停歇地说了几分钟：“我从一个理想主义者变成了何夕老师口中的现实主义者，但我也没有办法……现在小孩的教育压力真的太大了，我非常忧愁这样的教育会影响孩子的想象力发挥，但我也不知道怎么办。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;杨潇有一个写着很多中外科幻作家名字的本子，上面有郑文光，有奥尔迪斯，像一本中外科幻交流的合集。这次大会结束后，杨潇的本子上又多了一个名字，是吴文琛的儿子吴嘉麒。杨潇和谭楷把这个11岁的孩子请到台上，鼓励他的写作。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;1950年代，《中国少年报》编辑找到郑文光，请他为孩子们写一篇科幻小说。这是天文学家郑文光成为新中国成立后第一位科幻作家的契机。他在故事里虚构了三个偷偷开走火箭船的小孩，他们一路飞到火星的上空，看见了这颗星球上的红色沙漠和蓝绿色植物，这么绕着火星转了一大圈。 &lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;这个天真烂漫的故事发表在在1954年的《中国少年报》上，引发了意想不到的热烈反响，《从地球到火星》成为新中国第一篇有影响力的科幻小说：北京掀起了“火星热”，那时候，北京天文馆还没有成立。为了满足孩子们的好奇心，《中国少年报》编辑部在建国门上的古观象台架起一座天文望远镜。孩子们吃了晚饭，就到古观象台排队看火星，为此可以一直排到深夜。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;成都的这场大会同样热闹，有非常多的新闻报道，“但科幻还是一个小众的东西，甚至读它的人还没有读奇幻和魔幻的多。科幻不是一切，不要以为它代表一切、能拯救万物，好像科幻才能让科技发展，不是那么回事，我觉得就一个平常心来看待它。科幻大会是一个粉丝的文化，大家喜欢在一起。”韩松说。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这种平常心更接近韩松刚写科幻时的心境。在他的少年时代，1980年代，人们总想把什么送上太空去看一看。韩松的第一篇小说是中学时写的，他首先写陨石在地球砸了一个洞，人们往洞里看，什么也没有。老师说不行，他就写了一篇小说送一只熊猫上太空。 “没有写科幻的话，很可能我就是一个整天泡在酒局饭局里、吃完大家胡扯一通、然后打牌睡觉又开始第二天的人，一辈子就过去了，甚至更糟糕的是，加入到争名夺利的战争里去。”这么多年写科幻，与其说带来什么变化，不如说是不变，“科幻让一个人保持了少年时候那种好奇、纯粹、探究的心，甚至包括那时候那种莫名的惆怅、恐惧，那种本能的跟宇宙、自然的天然的联系。”&lt;/p>;

In a financial industry that affects the entire industry, what should be special about its benchmark? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to highlight the commonality of financial benchmarks, the research team of Southern Weekend New Finance Research Center has spent 9 months to optimize the indicator system and adjust the evaluation objects of the &quot;Golden Benchmark - China&#39;s New Financial Competitiveness List&quot; , data update, in-depth research and external expert jury scoring and other tasks. The rankings on the list are about to come out. &quot;Golden Benchmark - China&#39;s New Finance Competitiveness List&quot; and &quot;China&#39;s New Finance Development Trend Report 2023&quot; will be officially released at the &quot;New Finance Conference&quot; held in Beijing on December 8, 2023. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;How to determine the evaluation objects? Why does it take so long to make the evaluation list? Who are the members of the external expert jury? Compared with various financial industry lists on the market, what is unique about the &quot;Golden Benchmark - China&#39;s New Financial Competitiveness List&quot;? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend New Financial Research Center partially revealed this. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Focus on the “main force”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The “Golden Benchmark—China’s New Financial Competitiveness List” will be divided into eight sub-lists and the overall list. The evaluation targets for this list are the main forces in China’s financial industry. Which financial institutions are the main players? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend New Finance Research Center believes that leading institutions in the field of commercial banks, commercial insurance companies and public funds are the main force of China&#39;s financial industry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Compared with the first edition of &quot;China&#39;s New Financial Competitiveness List&quot; released from July to September, what adjustments are there to this list? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Time changes. Regarding the field of commercial banks, Southern Weekend New Finance Research Center included a total of 20 commercial banks including 6 major state-owned banks, 9 joint-stock banks and 5 city commercial banks based on the list of domestic systemically important banks released by the People&#39;s Bank of China in September 2023.

Therefore, compared with the first version of the &quot;China&#39;s New Financial Competitiveness Ranking&quot; released in July, one commercial bank was added to the evaluation list. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For the commercial insurance field, Southern Weekend New Financial Research Center included the top eight life insurance companies in terms of business scale in the evaluation. Compared with the previously released first version of the &quot;China&#39;s New Financial Competitiveness List&quot;, a large unlisted life insurance company has been added to the evaluation list. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the field of public funds and fund sales, Southern Weekend New Finance Research Center focused on evaluating the top 32 public fund institutions and 18 third-party fund sales institutions in terms of asset management scale. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To sum up, the list evaluation covers a total of 79 financial institutions, which is very representative. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Covering&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Eight&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Major areas&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Which business areas of financial institutions are the core considerations for the list evaluation? category? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Based on the strategic business sectors of commercial banks, life insurance companies, fund companies and fund sales companies and business areas closely related to the public, Southern Weekend New Financial Research Center combines wealth management, green finance, digital finance, data Eight areas including security, life insurance efficiency improvement, credit card quality and efficiency, risk control compliance and investment education quality are the core considerations for the list. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, in order to more objectively reflect the dynamic development of the financial industry, Southern Weekend New Financial Research Center further comprehensively optimized the wealth management list, green finance list, digital finance list, data security list, life insurance efficiency improvement list and The indicator system and the corresponding weights of each indicator in the six sub-lists of the Credit Card Quality and Efficiency List are designed to make the indicator system and related weights more reasonable and scientific. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Time shifting is also easy. The Southern Weekend New Financial Research Center will conduct a large-scale update of the list data based on the content disclosed in the 2023 interim reports of various financial institutions, supplemented by other relevant data. The previously released first version of the &quot;China&#39;s New Financial Competitiveness Ranking&quot; uses the 2022 annual report data and related data information of each financial institution as the evaluation benchmark. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is worth mentioning that the Southern Weekend New Financial Research Center has implemented a downgrade process for data disclosed by most financial institutions but not by individual financial institutions to reflect the importance of financial institutions in fully disclosing relevant information. of encouragement. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend’s New Financial Research Center will also release the 2023 “Financial Compliance Ranking” based on Southern Weekend’s self-developed “Shepherd-Financial Compliance Cloud Platform”.

Researchers from Southern Weekend&#39;s New Finance Research Center have been conducting surveys for more than a month to understand the latest and most in-depth developments of various financial institutions through questionnaire surveys, telephone surveys, online conference surveys, and field surveys. The results of this survey will account for 15% of the evaluation weight. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend New Financial Research Center also specially invited 7 key experts in the financial field.

There is no shortage of ancient poetry and text on these posters. Among them, the poem &quot;The Beginning of Winter&quot; appears quite frequently: &quot;I am lazy to write new poems with frozen pens, and the wine is warm in the cold furnace. When I am drunk, I look at the white ink flowers and the moon, and I wonder if the village in front is full of snow.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It seems, The situation described in this poem is indeed suitable for the beginning of winter. While retweeting the poetry copy, major official accounts also did not forget to add the poet&#39;s famous name: Li Bai. Perhaps because of these reasons, in recent years, every Beginning of Winter, this poem always &quot;stands out&quot; among other poems and has become a frequent visitor to the Beginning of Winter solar term promotion. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, as early as 2016, some Weibo netizens published a post revealing that the poem &quot;The Beginning of Winter&quot; was not written by Li Bai, but a forgery. On November 7, 2018, the netizen posted on Weibo and wrote: &quot;I have been refuting rumors for three consecutive years, but I still can&#39;t withstand the official big V being so tough... becoming the most powerful official disseminator of &#39;Li Bai&#39;s &quot;Li Dong&quot; fake poem.&quot; Until the Beginning of Winter in 2023, when this netizen posted, he would still include the rumor-refuting entry &quot;Li Bai&#39;s fake poem on the Beginning of Winter.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2018, Yu Xianhao, a professor at the School of Liberal Arts at Nanjing Normal University and an expert on Li Bai, also called the poem &quot;The Beginning of Winter&quot; a forgery in an interview with the &quot;Yangtze Evening News&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, this fake poem by Li Bai is not an isolated case. In 2020, Chen Shangjun, a professor of the Chinese Department of Fudan University, gave an example in an interview with Southern People Weekly. The most famous pseudo-poem in Tang poetry is &quot;Qingming&quot;, which is said to be written by Du Mu. He believes that this poem was not written by Du Mu, but by Du Mu. It was written in the Song Dynasty. In the interview, he also cited the statistical results of Japanese scholar Takeo Hiraoka, saying that although the Qing Dynasty&#39;s &quot;Complete Poems of the Tang Dynasty&quot; contains 49,403 poems, there are many fake poems in it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/09/dk0EbDGV3e4H0ZBVkrZBMmNZpZsgyZQV66yC4eH2.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height= &quot;683&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/09/dk0EbDGV3e4H0ZBVkrZBMmNZpZsgyZQV66yC4eH2.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;257741&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In August 2023, in Beijing, Li Bai’s humanoid robot appeared at the 2023 World Robot Conference. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So, where does the poem &quot;The Beginning of Winter&quot; come from? How are these pseudo-poems produced? &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“It suddenly appeared, which is very suspicious”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;As an ancient poetry lover who graduated from the Chinese Department, Xu Rongyu has been reading poetry as early as four or five years ago. While paying attention to the phenomenon of pseudo-poetry, she noticed that the poem &quot;Lidong&quot; was actually even earlier. However, at that time, because she had long been accustomed to Li Bai&#39;s many fake poems, she did not think of researching them specifically. It was not until 2022 that many readers and fans asked her some questions about pseudo-poetry, and she wrote a special research article. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In her opinion, the most direct way to check whether a poem is a forgery is to examine the circulation process of the poem - in which book did it first appear? Has it been tampered with by later generations during its circulation? Is the text you see today the original appearance? These are important questions. &quot;For ancient works to spread, they must have a carrier.&quot; Xu Rongyu told a reporter from Southern Weekend. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The existing ancient books database provides great convenience. Xu Rongyu first searched for the poem &quot;Lidong&quot; in &quot;Complete Poems of the Tang Dynasty&quot; and various existing collections of Li Bai&#39;s poems, but found no results. She turned her attention to the database of modern publications and found that some more rigorous books would include the sources of the poems. Some of them mentioned that the poem &quot;Lidong&quot; came from the &quot;Tang Poetry and Painting Book&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Tang Poems and Paintings&quot; is a printmaking collection of poetry, calligraphy and painting compiled and published by Huang Fengchi during the Wanli period of the Ming Dynasty. In &quot;Tang Poetry and Painting Book&quot;, the so-called poem &quot;The Beginning of Winter&quot; is actually called &quot;Winter Scenery&quot;, and the content of the third line of the poem is also slightly different. The &quot;Winter Scene&quot; version is &quot;Drunk and watching the white plum blossoms and the moonlight&quot;, while the &quot;Beijing of Winter&quot; version is &quot;Drunk and watching the whitening of the ink flowers and the moonlight&quot; - Xu Rongyu feels that although the latter looks very elegant on the surface, if you look closely at the &quot;moonlight whitening&quot;, You will find it difficult to explain the image of &quot;white flowers and moon&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In &quot;Tang Poems and Paintings&quot;, in addition to &quot;Winter Scene&quot;, there are also &quot;Spring Scene&quot;, &quot;Summer Scene&quot; and &quot;Autumn Scene&quot;. These four six-character poems are all falsely attributed to Li Bai. After more detailed research, Xu Rongyu discovered that there were rhyming errors in &quot;Xia Scene&quot;, while &quot;Autumn Scene&quot; had allusions that &quot;travelled&quot;, that is, the allusions used in the poem were decades later than when Li Bai was alive. year, this proves from the side that these poems were not written by Li Bai. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;(Moreover) This poem has no carrier or record from the Tang Dynasty when Li Bai lived to the Wanli period of the Ming Dynasty, and this poem has never appeared. Then in &quot;Tang Poetry and Painting Book&quot; , it suddenly appeared, which is very suspicious.&quot; Xu Rongyu told Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In an interview with the media in 2018, Yu Xianhao also mentioned that there were many editions of Li Bai&#39;s poetry collection before the Ming Dynasty. There are 998 poems by Li Bai, and none of the many anthologies and engravings handed down since then include six-character poems. In 1908, the Frenchman Pelliot discovered a Tang manuscript in Dunhuang, in which the Tang Dynasty&#39;s Selected Tang Poems included many poems by Li Bai, none of which were six-character poems. After more than 800 years, so many six-character poems suddenly appeared. It is very likely that booksellers fabricated them in order to sell books. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“In fact, many of the works in &quot;Tang Poems and Paintings&quot; are forgeries, including those of many well-known Tang Dynasty poets such as Du Mu. They may have been made by (booksellers) by asking some people to make money, because those The poet is well-known and has high traffic. (This bookseller) is a bit like today&#39;s gunmen.&quot; Xu Rongyu said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She introduced that the commercial economy of the Ming Dynasty was relatively developed, and the book engraving industry was also very developed. Engraved book printing was one of the hardest hit areas for forgery at that time. &quot;Many of the (forgeries) we see now were created by booksellers at that time in order to make profits and attract traffic. (Those celebrities) were big IPs.&quot; Xu Rongyu told Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;The ancients have always liked to ask others to write things&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Chen Shangjun once said in a media interview that the main source of about a thousand Li Bai&#39;s poems currently available to the public is It is a collection of Li Bai&#39;s own essays, various poetry selections from the Tang and Song Dynasties, as well as various history books, notes, poems, books, local chronicles, etc. &quot;Some poems are 100% Li Bai&#39;s, and some poems have only a 1% chance of being Li Bai&#39;s. There are at least dozens of pseudo-poems in Li Bai&#39;s name, and each situation is different.&quot; He said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He gave an example of &quot;Puppet Poetry&quot; written by Li Bai: &quot;Carving wood and pulling silk to make an old man, chicken skin and white hair are the same as the real one. After a while, nothing happened, and it still seemed like a dream in life. in.&quot; In &quot;Complete Poems of the Tang Dynasty&quot;, this poem appears simultaneously under the names of Li Bai, Tang Xuanzong and Liang Kun. Among them, the title of the poem under Liang Kun&#39;s name is &quot;Old Man Ying Wood&quot;. It is now generally believed that he is the author of this poem. This poem is indeed a Tang poem, but it was not written by Li Bai. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to Li Bai, there are also many fake works under the names of famous poets such as Su Shi and Xin Qiji. Lin Shan, who was born in the 1980s, is also a lover of ancient poetry and has been creating in this field for about ten years. Since 2022, he has successively conducted research on thirty pseudo-poems that have been widely circulated on the Internet, including the works of famous poets such as Xin Qiji. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Lin Shan’s view, forgery has a foundation in the history of literature: “The ancients have always liked to ask others to write things for various reasons. Some do not want to leave their own names, and some do. My own thoughts, but I didn’t dare to say them at the time, so I asked the ancients to write them. As for the fake poems, such as forging Li Bai, it may be just to seek fame. Although I am not famous, others mistakenly think that it is really Li Bai’s work, and I feel sad in my heart. It will be very cool. There are also cases like the Ming Dynasty where people deliberately forged (to make money).&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for the means of forgery, Xu Rongyu told Southern Weekend reporters that a relatively common The situation is to piece it all together, such as taking apart the sentences of the couplet and putting them together with other sentences to form a poem. Another option is direct forgery. For example, someone may want to engrave a forged book of Li Bai&#39;s works. Then he may directly ask a scholar to create the book and put it under Li Bai&#39;s name. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These two are also relatively typical means that lead to the emergence of many forgeries. As for some cases of false recognition, for example, the poet&#39;s name was mistakenly read when copying, and it has been passed down since the mistake was written; or in some movies, poems that were actually written by screenwriters were mistakenly thought to be really written by a certain poet during the dissemination process. , may also lead to forgery. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;对于不太了解古诗词相关知识的普通读者来说，要进行伪作的识别和考证，其实很困难。 &quot;Ordinary readers basically can&#39;t tell it apart, unless you have some knowledge of meter. But if the ancients compiled it, it&#39;s useless if you have knowledge of meter, because the ancients were all good at writing poetry, so it would be easy for them to forge it. &quot;Lin Shan told Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, he feels that if some metrical knowledge can be disseminated to students in the compulsory education stage, such as the fact that flat and oblique characters cannot overlap, it will also be helpful, at least for some &quot;particularly outrageous&quot; students. Most people can spot the forgery. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xu Rongyu also believes that it is difficult to identify fakes. “In fact, the biggest reason for the popularity of fakes is (there are problems in the communication link). People with very high influence may not necessarily have professional identification capabilities. Then you can pass the test; but people like us who can identify some things and write some popular science articles do not have such great influence.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But she feels that it is still important to have a questioning spirit, at least It&#39;s possible to be closer to the truth. &quot;I think the main thing is to have a sense of questioning: If you think something is wrong, go check it out. If you search on the Internet, you may find some people&#39;s doubts, and you can get closer to the truth. The main thing is to have this kind of&quot; &quot;Ask more, think more,&quot; Xu Rongyu told Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(At the request of the interviewee, Lin Shan is a pseudonym)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt; hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 09 Nov 2023 22:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[CEO被传失联，斗鱼“内忧外患”]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260293]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-09 21:03:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;On November 6, Douyu’s entry confirming that CEO Chen Shaojie was missing became a hot search on Weibo. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Previously, there were rumors that Chen Shaojie was under investigation and lost contact for three weeks. The 39-year-old CEO has always kept a low profile and rarely appears in the spotlight. The last time he appeared in the public eye was Douyu&#39;s 2023 second quarter results conference call held on August 14. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Douyu (DOYU.&amp;nbsp;Nasdaq), which was born in 2014, has survived the brutal fighting in the early days of China’s game live broadcast industry. It once ranked among the top two players in the industry with its ferocious playing style and Huya, which entered the game earlier than it. male. In 2019, Douyu ushered in a bright moment, following Huya to become a listed company on the US stock market. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, in the past two years, large comprehensive short and medium video platforms such as Bilibili, Kuaishou, and Douyin have accelerated their attacks, and the game live broadcast track has become increasingly popular. Douyu has also experienced the loss of anchors, weak performance, frequent scandals, etc., and its prospects are not optimistic. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 25, 2023, Douyu received a compliance warning from the Nasdaq Listing Qualification Department, stating that its closing price had been lower than US$1/share for 30 consecutive trading days and did not meet the compliance requirements. Nasdaq&#39;s minimum share price requirements. Douyu must maintain the closing price of its stock at no less than $1 per share for at least ten consecutive trading days within 180 days, or before April 22, 2024, in order to return to compliance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Echoing Douyu’s unpredictable prospects, there is also the whereabouts of CEO Chen Shaojie. Douyu told Southern Weekend reporters that Douyu has no official response to this news and the company is currently operating normally. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On November 8, Douyu closed at US$0.82 per share, a decrease of 1.19%. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;A person who likes adventure and licks blood&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In 1984, Chen Shaojie was born in Jinan, Shandong. Looking at his life experience: addicted to games, majoring in computer science, dropping out of college, and starting a business continuously, Chen Shaojie has gathered many characteristics of the trendsetters in the Internet era and successfully turned his hobby into a career. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Chen Shaojie himself once said bluntly in a Douyu live broadcast that he had a high school degree and dropped out of college after one year. He believes that spending four years studying does not necessarily mean a deep understanding of the Internet. Comparing the Three Kingdoms, he said that one&#39;s origin is not the most important. &quot;Liu Bei originally sold straw mats, Guan Yu sold dates, and Zhang Fei slaughtered pigs. As their respective With their growth, they have become the most awesome generals.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the end of 2009, Chen Shaojie and his partner Zhang Wenming sold their first entrepreneurial project, the &quot;Master&quot; battle game platform, to Shanda Games, and Chen became the general manager of Shanda Winger Wuhan Company. The function of the leader is to realize online battles in stand-alone games. Geek Park once reported that Leader is a successful product. One year after it was launched, it has registered a total of 450,000 people and has more than 200,000 daily active users. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2010, Chen Shaojie, who made his first pot of gold, acquired the two-dimensional video website AcFun (referred to as Station A) for about 4 million yuan, and launched the &quot;Shengfang Broadcasting&quot; live broadcast channel. In January 2014, Chen Shaojie independent &quot;Shengbangshu&quot; into a game live broadcast platform with barrage function - &quot;Douyu TV&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the following years, China’s game live broadcast industry entered an explosive period. In May 2014, Zhanqi Live, backed by the state-owned enterprise Zheshu Culture (600633.SH), was launched. In November of that year, YY spun off its game live streaming business and established Huya Live. In 2015, Longzhu Live and Wang Sicong’s Panda TV were established. In 2016, NetEase and Tencent successively launched CC Live and Penguin Esports. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Douyu has been the darling of capital since its appearance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Qichacha shows that Aofei Entertainment (002292.SZ) made an angel round investment of RMB 20 million in Douyu just after its establishment in 2014. In the same year, Sequoia Capital invested another US$20 million in Series A financing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In March 2016, Douyu’s Series B financing was led by Tencent, which invested RMB 400 million, followed by Nanshan Capital and Tianyu Digital (002354.SZ), with the total investment scale reaching US$100 million. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the Series C financing five months later, Phoenix Capital and Tencent led the investment, with participation from many institutions. Douyu finally raised 1.5 billion yuan. Before going public in 2019, Douyu received financing every year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Douyu, who is backed by financing, plays fiercely, which is also related to Chen Shaojie’s personal character. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There have been media reports that Douyu insiders evaluated Chen Shaojie as &quot;a person who likes taking risks and licks blood at the edge of a knife.&quot; Douyu once poached six anchors from the industry within a month, with a total fee of more than 60 million yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Gu Feng, founder of YY Game Live, once wrote an article analyzing why Douyu was able to overtake Huya in its early stages. “A big reason for the rise of Douyu is that we spent huge sums of money to sign the top anchors in YY and the industry from the beginning.” Before Douyu, YY game live broadcasts could be relatively controlled by controlling traffic and income distribution. Live anchor. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In his view, game anchors are different from entertainment anchors. The former has external effects, does not rely on live broadcast platforms, and has other opportunities to become Internet celebrities (such as e-sports events, Youku game channels, Weibo etc.), has the ability to bring its own fans, and can also bring fans to migrate, so YY Game Live has not signed a contract with the head anchor. This gave Douyu an opportunity to directly use the signing fee instead of the share to obtain top anchors, which became the core reason why Douyu could overtake Huya. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2017, the game live streaming industry went through a period of consolidation after a big wave, forming a &quot;fish-tooth confrontation&quot; pattern in the first echelon, with Douyu and Huya taking most of the game live streaming market share. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The problem of profitability is difficult to solve&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;On July 17, 2019, Douyu was listed on Nasdaq at an issue price of US$11.5 per share. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But its stock price only experienced a short period of sustained growth during the epidemic. On February 16, 2021, Douyu once reached an intraday high of US$20.54 per share, and then plummeted to less than US$1 per share now. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After entering 2021, Douyu’s quarterly revenue, except for the fourth quarter of that year, has been negative growth. According to its 2022 financial report, Douyu’s revenue growth relies heavily on paying users and revenue per paying user. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But Douyu is losing users. Wind data shows that in the second quarter of 2023, the number of quarterly paying users of Douyu was 4 million, a year-on-year decrease of 39.39%. The number of monthly active users was 50.3 million, a year-on-year decrease of 9.69%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Douyu’s current revenue still mainly comes from live broadcasts and advertising, and its attractiveness to advertisers continues to decline. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From 2020 to 2022, Douyu’s live broadcast revenue was 8.8522 billion yuan, 8.5966 billion yuan and 6.7973 billion yuan, accounting for 92.2%, 93.8% and 95.6% of the total revenue in the same period respectively. Douyu&#39;s advertising sales revenue was 645.2 million yuan, 464.9 million yuan and 190.3 million yuan, accounting for 6.7%, 5.1% and 2.7% of the total revenue in the same period respectively. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although revenue continues to decline, it will be profitable for two consecutive quarters in 2023. In the second quarter of 2023, Douyu’s net profit was 6.8 million yuan, and the net loss in the same period of 2022 was 38.8 million yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Douyu’s turnaround from losses to profits is the result of cost reduction and efficiency increase.” Ding Daoshi, a senior Internet observer, told Southern Weekend reporters that he does not think this is a healthy way to make money, but Expressing understanding, &quot;This is also a helpless strategy in extraordinary times.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the second quarter of 2023, Douyu’s expenses were 196 million yuan, a decrease of 42% from 340 million yuan in the same period last year. Among them, sales and marketing expenses decreased by 48% compared with the same period last year, research and development expenses decreased by 30.2%, and general and administrative expenses decreased by 48.2%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The sluggish performance of Douyu is due to the impact of short video platforms on traditional live broadcast platforms on the one hand, and the impact of leading video platforms such as Bilibili, Douyin, and Kuaishou on the gaming field on the other hand. Strong preemption. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the end of 2019, Station B spent 800 million yuan to defeat domestic live broadcast platforms such as Kuaishou, Douyu, and Huya, and won the exclusive live broadcast of the League of Legends (LOL) Global Finals (S Competition) in China for three years. copyright. In July of the same year, Kuaishou launched the “Million Game Creator Support Plan” and frequently held various competitions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Facing the unfavorable situation, in July 2020, Tencent tried to lead the merger of Douyu and Huya, but was later stopped by the regulatory agency on antitrust grounds in accordance with the law. As of March 31, 2023, Tencent held 46.7% of Huya’s shares and 37.7% of Douyu’s shares. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Game industry analyst Zhang Shule told Southern Weekend reporters that although Douyu and Huya are survivors of the game live broadcast melee, the failure of the merger means that both have lost an opportunity to integrate resources. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, Douyu and Huya continue to experience brain drain. In August 2023, Xuxu Baobao, the head anchor who had been live broadcasting on Douyu for 5 years, announced that he would switch to Douyin. In March before this, Huya outdoor anchor Mu Yingying also joined Douyin. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Anchors are like migratory birds, they go wherever it’s warm.” Zhang Shule said that anchors have no loyalty to the platform and are now jealous of selling products. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Ding Daoshi’s view, Douyu and Huya have few moats. In their early years, they relied on the Tencent system and related popular e-sports live broadcasts to rise. In recent years, Bilibili, Douyin, Kuaishou, and even video accounts can also conduct game live broadcasts. “There are so many people sharing the cake, but the growth rate of the cake is obviously not synchronized.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He believes that in this context, traditional e-sports live broadcast platforms represented by Douyu and Huya are in these A year-on-year decline is inevitable and the downward trend will continue. They are all looking for new growth paths outside of games, such as sports live broadcasts, but the results will take time to be verified. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhang Shule said bluntly that the overall revenue scenario of Douyu game live broadcasts and short videos is single. Facing the attack of other pan-entertainment platforms, Douyu lacks more effective checks and balances besides relying on Tencent. &quot;The biggest pain point is Profitability is still a problem.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He believes that Douyu’s only moat is Tencent, one of the three giant domestic game companies (the other two are NetEase and MiHoYo). Tencent has a huge control over the field of e-sports, and can use IP licensing and e-sports event licensing to reserve some private space for Douyu. However, opponents can still look for game and e-sports cooperation outside the Tencent system, so the moat is not wide. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhang Shule said that the plight of Douyu and Huya is almost the same, but now under the arrangement of Tencent, the two companies cannot merge and try and make mistakes at different times in order to find a way out. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In his opinion, Douyu’s gaming attributes are too strong, and the user portraits in the outdoor, appearance, and two-dimensional areas highly overlap with the gaming area. The real possible direction for Douyu to get out of trouble may be to combine new profit models in e-sports events that are also difficult to make profits. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“Ten Thousands of People Gather to Gamble”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;As a leading game live broadcast platform, Douyu has frequently received negative news about pornography, vulgarity, and alleged gambling in recent years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In September 2020, the official blog of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League published an article saying that the live broadcast room of Douyu anchor &quot;彡彡九屋&quot; (hereinafter referred to as 339) is suspected of hosting tens of thousands of people for gambling, and the daily turnover can reach several million. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In January 2021, the official blog of China Youth Network’s short video stated that the Douyu anchor “Changsha Village Death Squadron” is the “biggest casino in Douyu” and a lottery suspected of gathering gambling will be opened at 10 o’clock every night. , thus forming the public codename &quot;Ten Points Economic Lessons&quot;. In 2020, its turnover was as high as 177 million yuan, and its daily turnover was as high as 13 million yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2022, &quot;彡彡九Outdoor&quot; will be characterized as gambling. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to Sichuan Legal News, 339 member Fu Moulong and three other people &quot;tried to turn their bicycles into motorcycles&quot; through &quot;one card application for 50,000 yuan to take home&quot; between March 2017 and September 2020. &quot;A large number of inflammatory words such as &quot;Encourage live broadcast room viewers to participate in the lottery, and push lottery time and amount information to other people who did not participate in the live broadcast through platforms, WeChat groups, etc., resulting in a large number of people entering the live broadcast room during the live lottery period and paying.&quot; Apply for a card&quot;, swipe virtual gifts, etc. to participate in the lottery. After the draw, winning cash will be distributed to the winners. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Up to the time of their arrest, Fu Moulong and others had organized a total of 4,267 draws (times), with more than 4.42 million people participating, and gambling funds of nearly 120 million yuan. After trial, the Dujiangyan Court held that the actions of the three people constituted the crime of opening a casino, and they were sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment ranging from six to three years, and were also fined. This case is also the first gambling case involving a live broadcast platform in the country supervised and handled by the Ministry of Public Security. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In January 2021, Qian Xiaojia, the first brother of the former Douyu outdoor anchor, revealed in an interview that although gambling-related activities in 339 and other live broadcast rooms are not officially held by Douyu, the platform is not unaware of it. There will even be internal guidance. In the second half of 2019, Qian Xiaojia was banned by Douyu for violating regulations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On April 30, 2023, the Cyberspace Administration of China&#39;s WeChat public account &quot;CyberChina&quot; released the national cyberspace administrative law enforcement and supervision situation in the first quarter of 2023, stating that it will continue to promote the &quot;Qingming&quot; series of special actions , resolutely investigate and deal with all kinds of online illegal activities in accordance with the law. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It mentioned that Internet platforms such as Baidu, Sina Weibo, Douyu, and Douban failed to fulfill their main responsibilities and failed to manage the information released by their users, resulting in obscenity, feudal superstition, and solicitation of prostitution. Regarding the spread of harmful information on the Internet such as prostitution, gambling, and loan sharking, the Cyberspace Administration of China instructs the local Cyberspace Administration to conduct interviews, order rectifications, and carry out punitive measures in accordance with the law. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On May 8, &quot;CyberChina&quot; issued another article stating that in response to serious ecological problems such as pornography and vulgarity on the Douyu platform, the Cyberspace Administration of China directed the Cyberspace Administration of Hubei Province to send a working group to station Douyu platform launched a one-month centralized rectification supervision. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Zhang Shule’s view, China’s live broadcast craze originated from game live broadcasts, but game live broadcasts failed to break the barriers of consumption scenarios and failed to become the leader in the trend. It was not until the emergence of live broadcasts to bring goods that A new situation has opened up. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;The current game live broadcast platform is also looking for its own &#39;live broadcast delivery&#39;, but through crazy trial and error, many problems have arisen.&quot; Zhang Shule said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 09 Nov 2023 21:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[100万？300万？想不上班到底要存多少钱？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260278]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-09 20:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Recently, a netizen in Jiangxi shared his story. She and her husband spent 7 years saving 1 million yuan. After part of it was used to buy a house, the remaining 500,000 yuan was deposited in the bank. Now the monthly living costs can be covered by interest alone. She also shared a series of ways to save money, such as cooking at home for many years, not drinking coffee outside, only buying discounted clothes, taking her children to sunbathe instead of taking interest classes, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although the authenticity of this experience has not been verified, in February this year, a Shanghai couple did decide to &quot;retire&quot; with a deposit of 3 million yuan. This news sparked widespread discussion at the time. Just recently, Professor Chen Bingzheng from the Department of Finance at the School of Economics and Management at Tsinghua University was interviewed by CCTV Finance. He mentioned that “a survey found that over 70% of those born after 90 start to think about pension issues.” He said that it is too late to start thinking about pension issues at the age of 35.

Recently, in an interview with Guangdong Satellite TV&#39;s &quot;Financial Eyes&quot;, Dong Mingzhu responded publicly to the matter for the first time: Internet celebrities do not judge people&#39;s quality, and it is illegal for people to advertise outside Gree. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Dong Mingzhu said Meng Yutong’s part-time job accepting advertisements was illegal” was once a hot search topic. According to a report by the Shanghai Securities News on May 16, the reason for Meng Yutong&#39;s resignation was that he &quot;often missed work to participate in business activities and take on private work&quot; during his time at the company. After the company talked to him, he still carried out related activities without improvement. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During his tenure, Meng Yutong did receive advertisements on social media platforms. In the short videos on his Xiaohongshu account, he appeared many times selling clothing, beauty products, electronic products and household goods. In the &quot;Good Things Pocket&quot; column, there are 65 notes included, none of which have anything to do with Gree Electric products. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I originally thought that the rights and wrongs of this incident were very clear. However, many netizens believe that the contract Meng Yutong signed with Gree is a labor contract, not an endorsement contract. The time outside the eight hours is her own. Of course, she has the right to control how much she earns through endorsements and part-time advertising. Money is a reflection of her ability. This has also led to some discussions: Is it appropriate for the company to restrict employees from doing side jobs? If the income from your main job is not as good as your side job, will you leave your job? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What do you think of this point of view and these discussions? First of all, it must be said unequivocally that it is not appropriate to use Meng Yutong&#39;s case to demonstrate the rationality of employees taking part-time jobs or doing side jobs outside of their own jobs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Meng Yutong did graduate from a prestigious university, has a sweet appearance, and has good looks, but these qualities are not sufficient or necessary conditions to become an Internet celebrity. There are a lot of people with these qualities, but only a few lucky ones are successful. The track for Internet celebrities is very crowded and very winding. If someone says that Meng Yutong’s ability to become an Internet celebrity depends entirely or mainly on his personal abilities, that is undoubtedly not objective. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It can be said that Meng Yutong became an Internet celebrity mainly due to Dong Mingzhu’s efforts on top of his buildable personal qualities. Dong Mingzhu made her his secretary, and announced that he would train her to be his successor and take her to various occasions. Through the event, many hot searches and topics were created, bringing her countless traffic. Dong Mingzhu is working hard to make her the first person to bring goods to Gree live broadcast. In this sense, Meng Yutong, who has become an Internet celebrity, is an asset of Gree. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, Dong Mingzhu and Gree are obviously old-school, hoping that gentlemen&#39;s agreement and personal consciousness will have sufficient behavioral constraints on Meng Yutong, rather than &quot;first Before the company invests resources in an individual, it ensures and locks in potential future earnings, and limits and eliminates the risk of breach of trust of a sparrow that turns into a phoenix and then soars into the sky and escapes control. That is, the contract stipulates the rights and obligations of both parties and improves the The cost of breach of trust should be taken into account before you can safely invest in betting and package marketing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Later, when it was discovered that Meng Yutong was using the Internet celebrity identity created by the company to do private work, Dong Mingzhu and Gree did not immediately send a clear and strong signal saying &quot;this is not acceptable&quot;, but The reason is that there was no timely intervention or the intensity of the intervention was not enough. The mentality may be that the matter can be solved quietly internally, through reasoning and persuasion, so as to prevent the matter from turning into a negative incident or scandal. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, if Meng Yutong had been given a clear choice the first time he did private work, either to stop and hand over the proceeds from his private work, or to leave, the problem might have been solved long ago. When Meng Yutong took on more and more private jobs and his income outside of work became higher and higher, it became difficult for him to stop. At a certain stage, Dong Mingzhu could no longer tolerate it and had to resolve it through a final showdown, which brought us to the scene in May this year. Therefore, if there is something wrong with Dong Mingzhu and Gree, it is that they made the above two mistakes one after another. But this does not disprove that it is in line with professional ethics for Meng Yutong to use the Internet celebrity status created by the company to do private work and make big money. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Secondly, there is no simple answer to whether employees can work part-time or do side jobs outside of their regular jobs, and it needs to be analyzed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First, it depends on whether there are express provisions on this in the labor contract or other types of contracts signed with the company or organization. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At present, units within the system generally have some clear restrictions on employees&#39; part-time work, and will regularly conduct inspections on employees in this regard, allowing employees to declare on their own. Of course you can lie or conceal the situation, but if your employer finds out, you will inevitably be punished or even lose your job. In addition, well-regulated companies generally prohibit employees from receiving remuneration from competitors, suppliers or customers. This not only potentially harms the company&#39;s interests, but may also lead to criminal investigation in serious cases. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Second, it depends on the nature of your part-time job or side job, and whether there is any conflict of interest with your work in the unit and the business of the unit. You are a salesperson and have accumulated a lot of customer resources. At a certain stage, if you set up a business and go it alone, the company may not be able to do anything to you. However, if you secretly set up a business with a similar nature to the company while receiving a salary from the company, A company that imports customer resources into its own company is undoubtedly against professional ethics, and the company may not let it go if it finds out. Or if you are a technical R&amp;D person and sell the code you wrote in the company to a competing company or other companies, or take work from a competing company, this will also damage the company&#39;s rights and interests and seriously violate professional ethics. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Therefore, &quot;Besides the eight-hour working time, it is all your own time, you can do whatever you want.&quot; This statement must be at least restricted by the above two rules. In the final analysis, it means respecting the contract and Observe professional ethics. As long as it does not violate the contract and company regulations, does not harm the company&#39;s rights and interests, has no conflict of interest with the company, and does not affect the main job, generally speaking, the company has no objection to individuals doing side jobs and part-time jobs to increase their income. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 09 Nov 2023 20:25:58 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[桐子故事丨峡河西流去]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260210]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-09 19:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 11/08/NutlzMHR2UbsNNB6zpzzOTaygMtBDmbXoFeHEPjT.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;701&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/NutlzMHR2UbsNNB6zpzzOTaygMtBDmbXoFeHEPjT . jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;257541&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Tongzi flowers bloom. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;一&lt;/strong >;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;From Xiahe to Luanzhuang, we have to cross three ridges. It&#39;s not the three ridge heads, it&#39;s the third ridge head counting from Taoping. Taoping has now changed from a township to an administrative village. It is where the Santiao Ridge originates and the Yitiao Ridge begins. Going further south is the Funiu Mountains and then enters Nanyang. Why it is called Santiaoling instead of Sandaoling or something else is not clear. Indeed, the word &quot;Tiao&quot; is a bit strange, as if it is a ridge rather than a mountain. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The side of Santiao Ridge near Luanzhuang is a ten-mile downhill slope. At the bottom of the slope is the Bada River. After crossing the river and going five miles eastward, you will reach Luanzhuang Town. Luanzhuang Town has been the capital of Luanzhuang since the Republic of China, the so-called economic, cultural, transportation and power center. The ancient town that was more than a hundred years old now has no trace of the past. Instead, there are concrete buildings rising from the ground on both sides of the Luanzhuang River, which is sometimes dirty and sometimes clear. Everything sold on the street is modern. For example, household appliances used for heating in winter are electric braziers instead of charcoal. Even the dogs running on the street have many fashionable hair styles. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the side of the ten-mile downhill road, there are all tung trees. Of course, that was a scene more than thirty years ago. Nowadays, it is all pine trees and arrowgrass. The pine trees are overbearing and the arrowgrass is not a fuel-efficient lamp. With them, there is no one else. There are only a few tung trees here and there, and the old-fashioned people have nowhere to stand. In today&#39;s spring and summer, the mountains are green and interspersed with wild flowers of strange colors. Walking through this place gives people the excitement and satisfaction of returning home in rich clothes. In winter, half of the mountains are green and half are withered and yellow, like a failed oil painting. The economy of small places is not good. Traffic management personnel hide in those curves, use the terrain and vegetation to catch illegal motorcycles, and fine them to generate revenue. They catch them accurately. Unless there is an urgent matter, people rarely ride there. If you want to go there, you will choose morning or evening. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;More than thirty years ago, I was a junior high school student in Luanzhuang Town. At that time, most of my classmates didn&#39;t like studying very much, and it seemed that going to school was just to complete tasks to pass the time of their youth. In comparison, I love studying more, but compared with those brain-burning words and numbers, I still love things that have nothing to do with grades, such as tung seeds, from tung flower to tung seeds, I love them all. No matter what, it just feels good. I feel that they are mine and I am theirs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tongzi flowers bloom in March. At this time, many flowers have finished. The peach blossoms, apricot blossoms, pear blossoms and begonia flowers have all disappeared, but more summer flowers have not yet arrived. The day is already very warm. At this time, it suddenly gets cold, and there may even be snow. When the temperature becomes warm again, the tung flowers will bloom. The adults said that the tung flowers are still frozen by the cold wind. The tung flower is neither beautiful nor ugly, neither big nor small, but its aroma is different, it is a delicate fragrance, and the smell is very similar to its color and shape: white petals inlaid with light red ones. Each flower and branch is similar, like twin sisters. The tung flower blooms on one slope, so vast and dense that no one else can be seen. From a distance, the flowers on a slope look like chatty words that no one can talk about. Unlike other flowers, there are red, green and space. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There were many children at that time. If they all rushed to school together, there would be a long queue from front to back. The front is in the Tung Blossom Array, and the back is still on the other side of the ridge. The front is across the Bada River, and the back is still in the Flower Array. Everyone who goes to school carries a net bag, and the white buns, black buns and mixed-noodle buns in the pockets are clearly visible. Girls love vanity. They cover the buns with a layer of newspapers so that they can only see the prosperous scene of the motherland but not the buns. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tongzi flowers have one use: treating burns. At the mouth of the Bascha River, there was an old Taoist priest who had returned to secular life. He was very old, bent over, and his beard and hair were all white. He often goes to the mountains to collect fallen tung flowers. The fallen tung flowers were spread all over the ground, as dense as tree heads. The strange thing was that there was no decrease in the trees, as if they were growing while falling. He carries a woven bag and collects a bag of fallen flowers. I don’t know what he did with it when he took it back. He mixed it with other ingredients, mixed it into a paste, put it in large and small bottles, and applied it on the injured person’s burns. I don’t know which year the old Taoist priest died, and the prescription for treating burns was taken away with him. He had no children, and no one passed him on. Besides, he couldn&#39;t make a living by treating burns. There weren&#39;t many burns all year round. He doesn&#39;t rely on this for a living either. If you get burnt, you have to go to the hospital and spend a lot of money. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Two months after the tung flower bloomed, the tung seeds came out. They were all green and tender, but they were actually too hard to be broken open. The boys were throwing it at each other and hitting a bag on their heads. If you smash it open with a stone, you will find that the tung seeds are white and plump and crowded together. They are very fragrant when chewed in your mouth. They are more delicious than walnut kernels, but after a while, you will have a headache and nausea. The shell of the tung seeds removed and dried in the sun is a good material for making fires, which is perfect for burning the kang in winter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The school cafeteria only has one kind of rice, corn grits soup and porridge made from corn grits over high and slow fire. It only has breakfast and lunch. In the evening, you can only eat your own steamed buns or cook them until dawn. The food for dinner is very important. It must have oil and water, but most of them don’t have oil and water. It’s okay to have no oil and water. There are some varieties, but there are few varieties. It’s just a bucket of garlic juice mixed with sauerkraut, and the amount is limited, so it must be distributed reasonably. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is a lacquer tree in front of Jinsuo&#39;s house. It is more than three feet tall and as thick as a hug. Such a large lacquer tree is rare. In summer, it blocks the sky and the sun, but in autumn, the lacquer seeds can be broken down to boil a large pot of lacquer seed oil. Lacquer seed oil is also a kind of edible oil, and can also be used to light lamps. On the way to send the deceased, a burning lantern can be lit. But the tree is too old, half prosperous and half withered, and half of the tree trunk is rotten. One summer, after a rain, a large mushroom grew on the dry side of the tree. It was red and yellow in color, like a flaming cloud falling from the western sky. The sumac mushroom is one of the finest tree mushrooms. It is tender and delicious and can be served on banquets. Jinsuo and I broke it off and filled a basin full of it, but he had no oil at home and couldn&#39;t find it after searching through the cabinets and corners. I said, if there is a way, go get the tung seeds to refine the oil. We went up to Santiao Ridge. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is not difficult to refine oil from tung seeds. We picked a basket of tung fruits, smashed them open, dug out the tung seeds, crushed them with a garlic mortar, boiled them in a pot, removed the residue, and made a bowl of oil. I heard adults say that no matter what kind of oil it is, as long as it contains poison, it will be fine. When the tung seeds are boiled in a pot, the water vapor is boiled away and the smoke is released, which is considered to be poisonous. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We had vomiting and diarrhea all night. Jinsuo’s father gave us washing powder and water, and he stopped only the next day. Fortunately, I didn’t eat much that day and put in less oil. We didn&#39;t go to school for three days. We were both in the third grade of junior high school that year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A few years later, Jinsuo went to college and I went to the mines, and our fates parted ways from then on. I don’t have his phone number, and he doesn’t have any contact channels with me. After his parents died, we knew nothing about each other. The only thing we vaguely knew was that he went to Europe after not working for a few years, married a wife, and settled down in a foreign country. Become your hometown. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The only remaining tung trees on Santiao Ridge will bloom a few branches in some years. The scattered tung flowers are hidden among the green bushes, which are more beautiful than the large stretches of tung flowers and do not look lonely at all. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;二&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Tung fruit usually matures in mid-to-late October. The fruit changes from green to light red, and finally turns to dark brown, and it is ready for harvest. The pedicle of the tung fruit is very strong and closely connected to the branches. Unlike walnuts and chestnuts, which are easy to knock off, harvesting the tung fruits is a very slow and hard work. If the branches are not high, it is best for women and children to pick them by hand. Fast. The men climbed up the tree, beat it with bamboo poles, and beat the tree branches into hairless ghosts. There were always a few tung fruits that remained motionless, and in the end they had no choice but to leave them for the next year. Tongzi&#39;s body was heavy, and transportation was also a laborious task. A good laborer had to carry a basket, and he was hunched over and panting due to the exertion. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The use of hammers is very wide. Almost any work related to breaking can be solved by pounding. The most effective way to produce tung rice is to thoroughly dry the tung fruits and pour them into a wormwood pit and pound them. This work is usually done by women and children. The cleaned rice is white and tender, like suet. We children were caught in the middle and busy, and when others were not prepared, we threw a pill in our mouths, and the adults picked it out, and vomited all over the floor. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tung oil is the oil squeezed from tung seeds. The process of pressing tung oil is similar to that of peanut oil. When I was a child, I had a good deed and a monkey spirit. I participated in the oil extraction work of adults many times. I don’t remember the tedious details. I only remember the transparency and purity of tung oil. There is no corresponding reference for the light yellow color, so I can’t describe it. , using one thing to describe and explain another thing, this ancient and omnipotent language method completely fails in the face of tung oil. The squeezed tung oil was put in pots and bowls, and outsiders came to buy it. Although they couldn&#39;t sell it for much, they made money from the oil, salt, sauce and vinegar. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tung oil is the best paint for furniture, and Master Lin is the best painter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Generally speaking, a carpenter is also a painter, and a painter is also a carpenter. It is rare that a family hires a carpenter, and then hires a painter after finishing the furniture. A carpenter does not necessarily have to be talented, but he must be versatile. Otherwise, he would not be able to compete with hundreds of others. There is only Master Lin, who only knows how to paint. He knows nothing about the carpenter&#39;s work, but because his craftsmanship is so good, even if he has a unique skill, he still has no worries about making a living. eat. Because his craftsmanship is so good, his peers often lose their way out, making people both admire and hate them. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Master Lin is not a local either. Some say he is from Henan, some say he is from Hubei, and some say he is from Sichuan. If he does not say it himself, others will just guess. People&#39;s basis is his accent, but for people who have been away for a long time, eating in all directions and enjoying the scenery in all directions, the local accent has long since disappeared, leaving behind a mixed accent. Master Lin was forty years old when he came to Xiahe. His craftsmanship was not learned in Xiahe, but brought from afar. He became a master as soon as he arrived. He himself said that it was a family tradition, and naturally everyone believed this statement. Most good craftsmanship comes from family traditions. Forty-year-old Master Lin arrived in Xiahe and married a woman at the age of forty-one, which naturally benefited from his good craftsmanship. The woman is seventeen or eighteen years younger than him, and she is still a girl. Her name is Liu Lanhua. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu Lanhua’s father is a mat craftsman and has been weaving reed mats all her life. When you go out to weave, you also weave at home. People who need it come to buy it or exchange it with it. Liu Xijiang&#39;s career as a mat craftsman consists of two methods, half of which is home-based work, and the other half of which is a family workshop. When Liu Xijiang got old, he didn&#39;t go out anymore. He kept a reed garden on the mountain behind his house. It was five or six acres, and it was enough for people with a radius of dozens of miles. Craftsman Liu Xi has been weaving mats all his life and has saved some money. He is considered a wealthy family in the surrounding area. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the early years, people were too poor to afford coffins. When most people died, they were rolled into the earth with a reed mat. Naturally, the reed mat was made by craftsman Liu Xi. The craftsman Liu Xishan weaved from east to west mountains, weaving from day to night. Half of the mats weaved were used to dry food and half were used to roll people. Later, people&#39;s lives became more relaxed, and some people began to use coffin boards. Of course, reed mats were not absent from the burial. Later, everyone switched to coffin boards, and there was no such thing as reed mats. There are stars and moon, and at this time, someone begins to paint the coffin to make the deceased sleep more peacefully and longer underground. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Carpenter Liu Xi has been weaving mats all his life, and saw countless people being swept away by what he weaved with his own hands, but from the bottom of his heart, he did not approve of the way of sweeping people to their graves. He felt that it was really a waste of human life. . Similarly, he also hated the way people later painted coffins with chemical paint bought from the street. Not only was it not antiseptic, but how could the smell make people feel peaceful? In short, people are too busy in this life and have never had a good night&#39;s sleep. When they leave and enter another world, they must sleep more peacefully and more solidly. Liu Xijiang&#39;s greatest ideal is to have a tung oil coffin. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Master Lin helped him realize this ideal. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On that day, the whole village, young and old, witnessed the great and spectacular process of tung oil changing from raw oil to mature oil. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Master Lin built a waist-high earthen stove in the yard of Liu Xijiang’s house. He set up a large iron pot on the stove and burned it with oak firewood. The smooth and clean stones are put into the pot and stir-fried. After the stones are hot, raw tung oil is poured in. There must be some care about how much to pour. Master Lin just pours it without saying anything. Then the pot swelled, and as the temperature rose higher and higher, the water vapor in the tung oil gradually evaporated. There was a fragrance in the air, and the fragrance was overwhelming, covering the whole yard like a big blanket. But the fragrance was something that no one had ever smelled before. It was so strong and unrestrained that I couldn&#39;t tell whether it was good or bad. At this time, everyone saw oily flowers blooming from the tung oil in the pot. Master Lin quickly added a shovelful of powdery stuff. After a while, a layer of white foam appeared on the surface of the tung oil, and thick yellow smoke came out. Master Lin directed a young man to stir vigorously with a wooden stick, and the foam quickly combined with the tung oil. At this time, the color of the smoke changed from yellow to black, and the thick smoke rose straight into the sky and gradually dissipated. Master Lin used a wooden stick to pick out a strand of tung oil, dripped it on the stone, dipped his fingers in the tung oil and stretched it upwards, pulling out a long filament. Master Lin ordered people to quickly put out the fire under the pot and shouted: It&#39;s done! &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The people watching were curious, nervous, and confused, as if they were in a dream. I feel that Master Lin is really amazing. I just realized that tung oil can be boiled into something good. In the past, I always sold the tung oil raw, which is a pity. Several years later, when boiling tung oil was no longer a unique skill, everyone realized that the powdery things were soil powder and camphor. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The cypress coffin board, which has been brushed three times with mature tung oil from the outside to the inside, is like a multi-sided mirror, reflecting the strange and curious faces of a group of people, the sun in the sky and the wandering clouds. . To prove the efficacy of tung oil, Master Lin poured a bucket of water into the coffin. When he poured it in, the bucket was full, and when he scooped it out, the bucket was full, no more, no less. Liu Xijiang said that this stupid tung oil could protect one&#39;s body for a thousand years! &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;三&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Master Lin and Liu Lanhua had a daughter named Lin Ping&#39;er. Liu Lanhua has a good figure and two nice buttocks, which are like a ball of cotton. She can be as plump as she wants. It doesn&#39;t matter how many children she has, but she doesn&#39;t dare to have children. The policy is tight and she can&#39;t afford the fine. The year Master Lin left, Lin Ping&#39;er was thirteen years old and still in junior high school. After all, Liu Lanhua and Master Lin have been husband and wife for fourteen years. Liu Lanhua was really reluctant to leave Master Lin. On the day of the burial, it was raining, and Liu Lanhua was soaked from head to toe. Some said it was rain, some said it was tears, but it was both. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Everything counts. Master Lin has lived in Xiahe for fourteen years, and his career as a tung oil craftsman has lasted fourteen years. It is neither long nor short, but the tung oil he has used and the furniture he has painted, I don&#39;t know how to measure it clearly. The craftsmanship he passed down and the industry he promoted intentionally or unintentionally came to an abrupt end five years after he left. According to the new economic development requirements and the transformation of rural industries, the superiors required that tung trees be abandoned and pine trees be planted instead. An industry or an industry finally withered and died with the changes of the world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One day a year, Master Lin sent Lin Pinger to school. The school was in the town. He picked her up on Saturday and sent her to school on Sunday. He rides a big car, with his schoolbag and dry food bag hanging on the front of the car, and his daughter on the back seat of the car. Three ridges below the car, Tongzi flowers are blooming, flowers on the road, flowers outside the road, the head is connected to the tail, the tail is connected to the head, people and cars are passing through the flowers, the sky is above the head, the fragrance of the flowers in the nostrils is really exciting So happy. Master Lin thought, this year will be a good harvest again. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The car arrived at Erdaopan, where there was a spring with clear water gurgling sweetly and sweetly all year round. People, birds, and small animals come and go here to drink water and rest. Because the pool is at a low level, people need to kneel down and stretch their necks to drink the water. There is a legend that there is a fish spirit in the spring. It has been worshiped by people for a long time and has achieved enlightenment. Sometimes it comes out at night to clean the dirt in the pool, so that the spring will always be pure and pure, but no one has ever seen it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Master Lin was a little hungry. He divided a cake in half, half for himself and half for his daughter, and ate it with spring water. When he took the second bite, he felt that the cake was stuck in his throat, unable to go up or down. He picked up a handful of water and poured it down, but it didn&#39;t work. He knew what was going on. He remembered that his mother was in the same situation. She was stuck like this for several years and then left. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The coffin that Master Lin asked the craftsmen to build for him was a Paulownia wood coffin. The Paulownia wood is soft and does not rot, but the advantage is that it takes no effort to obtain. A row of big trees grows beside the yard. , using local materials. Liu Lanhua said, it&#39;s still early, let the tree grow for a few more years. Master Lin said, it’s getting late and you have to prepare morning and evening. Liu Lanhua said, prepare a bite for me too. Master Lin said, it&#39;s still early for you, let the tree grow for a few more years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The spectacular scene of Master Lin boiling tung oil for himself was exactly the same as the scene when he boiled tung oil for the first time in Liu Xijiang’s yard fourteen years ago. There were many onlookers and many who helped. Although this technology is no longer a secret at this time. When the firewood at the bottom of the pot was finally removed, Liu Lanhua was a little panicked and punched a hole in the bottom of the pot, and the boiled tung oil poured down. Although everyone tried hard to save it, only one third of the shiny good stuff was saved. , the missing part turned into a burst of fire. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Master Lin’s coffin board was halfway painted and he ran out of tung oil. He had to go to the street to buy a bucket of foreign paint to finish the other half. Master Lin sighed and said, this is fate. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Two years after Master Lin left, one day, Liu Lanhua received a letter with an unknown address and unknown sender. The recipient&#39;s name was Lin Yide. Liu Lanhua didn&#39;t recognize the middle character in the name, so she asked her daughter Lin Ping&#39;er. Lin Ping&#39;er was in high school at this time and there were no characters she didn&#39;t recognize. She said that character was pronounced &quot;yì&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu Lanhua initially thought that the sender had written the address and name wrong, and wanted to return it. Her husband&#39;s name was Lin Jianye, and she had never heard of this strange name. The rural postman said that there was nothing wrong, the postal code was correct. Besides, who knew where to return it and to whom? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu Lanhua opened the letter and read it. After finishing speaking, she realized that the sender had not sent the wrong address and recipient. After she finished reading the letter, she quietly wiped away tears, then threw the letter into the pot hole and burned it. The burned letter did not turn into ashes, but kept the shape of the paper. It floated out of the stove hole, flew out of the yard, and was in the air. Floating. Liu Lanhua said in her heart, just let it go. I have read it, and you have read it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lin Ping&#39;er came out of the room with a piece of clothing and asked what it was written on. Liu Lanhua said that there was nothing written. Someone sent the letter to the wrong place. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 09 Nov 2023 19:55:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[东西方贵族是如何消亡的？从贵族到精英是身份政治的式微]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260200]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-09 18:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>; Lucy Challenger, a blogger who claims to be a &quot;British etiquette expert&quot;, posted a video on TikTok, Teach netizens how to eat rice with a knife and fork in formal occasions. She believes that in a Western environment, one should not eat rice with hands, spoons or chopsticks, but should push the rice to the top of the back of the fork with a table knife and then put it elegantly into the mouth, which can appear more educated and graceful. This &quot;aristocratic&quot; video triggered all kinds of ridicule and ridicule. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many Chinese people also like to emphasize the concept of nobility, such as nobility in houses, cars, and clothing brands... Even a few days ago, I even saw the &quot;nobility&quot; in latex paint in building materials stores. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;They say they are aristocrats, but in fact they are mostly consumption paranoia. The social group of aristocrats has died, or is close to death, in both Eastern and Western societies. It is also an interesting historical review journey to have a general understanding of the birth, development, decline, and demise of aristocrats in Eastern and Western societies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In ancient Eastern and Western societies, aristocrats were born almost at the same time in the early stages of civilization. The development can be roughly divided into three major historical stages: classical aristocracy, ancient aristocracy, and modern aristocracy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Classical aristocracy began in the Western Zhou Dynasty and Spring and Autumn Period in the East, and emerged in the Republic of Ancient Rome in the West. Because they arose in the early days of agricultural society, the classical nobility in the East and West all originated from large landowners. In the Spring and Autumn Period in the East, princes were nobles, and the feudal system was an ancient system of large land ownership. Dining with bells and dishes, wine pools and meat forests are the lifestyles of nobles that distinguish them from common people. The titles of duke, marquis, uncle, son, and male divided the nobility hierarchy, including the &quot;scholar&quot; class attached to the nobility, and constituted the ruling order of ancient oriental agricultural society. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the West, in ancient Greek society, which was slightly earlier than ancient Rome, the aristocracy was not very powerful. Due to the lack of large contiguous areas of land in the Balkans, ancient Greece developed an early democratic system that reflected the demands of the wealthy business class in the city-states for an equal distribution of power. Rome owned a large amount of land in its conquered areas, such as North Africa and Spain, so it produced a large number of landed aristocrats. They were a strong foundation supporting the Roman Empire and shared power in the Senate. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the era of classicism, the aristocrats of the East and West not only monopolized a large amount of land and wealth, but also monopolized culture, knowledge, and art, producing and consuming amazing cultural and artistic achievements of that era: Ancient Greece and Roman sculpture and architectural art, as well as the elegance and praise in the Eastern &quot;Chu Ci&quot; and &quot;Poetry&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The 4th and 5th centuries AD were a watershed era in the changes of human civilization: the classical civilizations in the East and West (Eastern Han Dynasty and Western Rome) were defeated by the northern barbarians, and human civilization entered a period of darkness that lasted for hundreds of years. Era (or &quot;Middle Ages&quot;). The classical nobility died out in this era, and instead, the second round of &quot;ancient nobility&quot; (medieval nobility) emerged in both the East and the West. Moreover, in this era, both the East and the West produced military lord aristocrats. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the West, after the Germanic tribes conquered the Western Roman Empire, they divided territories and enfeoffed feudal lords, resulting in a large number of barbarian military nobles. These medieval nobles were rough, unpretentious, and simple... almost all of them They are illiterate. They only emphasize the spirit of martial arts. They compete with each other on whose arms are thicker, stronger, and have longer swords. If nothing happens, they compete on horseback. European military aristocrats regarded reading and writing as shameful and unmanly. The writing needs at the administrative level were almost entirely borne by priests and attendants. As a result, Christianity monopolized the ideology, culture and art of medieval Europe. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the East at the same time, the gentry (similar to aristocrats) in the Southern and Northern Dynasties and the Sui and Tang Dynasties were divided: the southern gentry, because of their &quot;dress and clothes&quot;, had higher cultural and artistic accomplishments, and were known as elegant and weak. The northern aristocracy has a considerable part of the Hu people&#39;s ancestry, and their cultural and artistic standards are low, but their military force value is high. This supported the &quot;Guanlong military aristocracy&quot; of the Sui and Tang dynasties. In the 6th and 7th centuries AD, the northern aristocratic army conquered the southern gentry, and China entered the second era of great unification. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Unification promoted economic and social development, and culture and art also flourished. Although the cultural level of the northern aristocrats was low, they were still improving. Their huge wealth was enough to support and consume great masters such as Li Bai, Du Fu, Wu Daozi, Yan Liben, and Li Guinian. The prosperity of the Tang Dynasty created the peak era of national culture and art. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The development of culture and art seems to inevitably lead to weak, hedonistic, decadent and even decadent lifestyles, both in the East and the West. In the East, the &quot;Huang Chao Uprising&quot; at the end of the Tang Dynasty completely ended the aristocratic era in China. To put it simply, all the nobles were killed, and &quot;the bones of the public officials were trampled on in the streets.&quot; Since the Tang Dynasty, there have been no aristocrats in China. It has entered the era of common people and landlords. The emperor and his relatives are also representatives of the common people and landlords. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;France is similar. From after the &quot;Hundred Years&#39; War&quot; to before the &quot;Great Revolution&quot;, the French aristocrats were prosperous, extravagant and luxurious. They lived a paradise-like life on earth for hundreds of years and created astonishing world-class culture and art. At the same time, it burned up the national wealth and led to the social and economic collapse of France. In the end, the entire modern French aristocratic group was almost ended on the guillotine. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Germany and England are the Anglo-Saxon branches of the Germanic ethnic group, and their medieval martial ethics lasted relatively long. The tradition of military aristocracy of these two ethnic groups even lasted until the middle of the 20th century. Until the two world wars, machine guns, cannons, tanks, bombers... ended a large number of British and German military aristocrats on the battlefield, and the modern aristocracy in Europe finally declined. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The movie &quot;Kingsman: The Secret Service&quot; vividly tells this historical process: As a large number of military nobles died on the battlefield, the vast aristocratic wealth became ownerless property, CEOs (not Boss) promoted the modern transformation of European society. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In modern society, the rise of the elite class is no longer the aristocracy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Nobility is identity politics and hereditary. The elite emphasizes non-identity politics, ability first, self-strength, and survival of the fittest. According to our ancient saying, &quot;Excellence in learning leads to officialdom.&quot; However, it is not enough to study well. You must also be good at doing things, obey laws and regulations, and be socially responsible. The elites of modern society: Most of them come from the civilian class, such as Elon Musk. Before he became successful, he also paved the floor in his garage. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Modern elite politics does not monopolize power like aristocratic politics, but breaks class solidification and opens up channels for individual advancement and dimensionality reduction, which is of great significance for preventing social rigidity and corruption. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Even Musk, the world’s richest man with hundreds of billions of dollars, has some unscrupulous sons. If we cannot effectively inherit, pioneer, and enterprising, we will fall back into mediocrity and will not be able to enjoy the hereditary privileges of the nobility. This is the modern elite system. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I hope that everyone can cheer up and make progress as much as possible, produce as many elites as possible to promote social progress, realize self-worth, and have fewer aristocratic dreams. That concept has been eliminated by history. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 09 Nov 2023 18:25:04 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
