He is 53 years old and has been in prison for nearly thirty years. In the past ten years, lawyers have repeatedly applied for him to have his sentence commuted or even released from prison, but each time he was rejected. From November 4, 1995 to the present, many extreme things have passed away, and the title of &quot;the most dangerous person&quot; in Israel still belongs to him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Amir fired three shots with a semi-automatic pistol, staining Prime Minister Rabin&#39;s blood red that day. At that time, Rabin attended a rally in Tel Aviv&#39;s Kings Square. After speaking, he was about to get into his car when he was shot twice and his bodyguard was also wounded. After Rabin&#39;s death, King&#39;s Square was renamed Isaac Rabin Square. Even now when I walk there, I still have a strange feeling: not because I am immersed in sadness, but because of the monument in the square commemorating Rabin. The sculpture looks so strange: it looks like a pyramid frame composed of three huge triangular wooden fences, with the tip pointed to the ground, and it is all rusty red. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/16/jimLNhy65dBQ1iOPFmsQ6dymlgNkafRUoqioRDOS.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/16/jimLNhy65dBQ1iOPFmsQ6dymlgNkafRUoqioRDOS.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254180&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Orthodox Jewish ghettos are often messy and quiet, but this is where the hearts of the fanatical believers belong. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Yun Ye Tui/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Previously from 1993 to 1995, Amir completed his compulsory military service and was among the best in Israel. He studied law and computers at Bar-Ilan University. During this period, Israel, under the leadership of Prime Minister Rabin, negotiated peace with Arafat, the leader of the Palestine Liberation Organization, and signed the Oslo Accords. The conciliatory gesture angered the country&#39;s extreme right wing. Amir and his brother were both extreme right wingers and conspired to kill Rabin. In 1996, Amir was sentenced to life imprisonment, and the bodyguard who was injured outside was sentenced to six years. His brother Haggai was sentenced to 16 years in prison. After the arrival of the new century, the left-wing parties led by Rabin and Shimon Peres gradually declined. The right-wing has long occupied the leadership position in Israeli politics, but Amir has never been released from prison. However, after 2003, a Russian-Jewish woman named Larisa Trumpovler kept visiting him in prison. The two got married in 2005, and two years later, they got the child of love through in vitro fertilization, named Yi Nong. Amir has never been released from prison, and their union and offspring were all carried out with approval. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2003, when Larissa first started dating Amir, a 77-year-old man named Herz Frank followed her with a camera. Frank is a Jewish citizen who immigrated to Israel from Latvia in 1993. When Larissa appeared, he seemed to realize that the thing he most wanted to do in life had appeared. He wanted to find out about Amir, the man everyone talked about. How did the perverted and terrifying prisoner come to associate with Larissa? What’s more, I want to know what motivation Larissa had to plunge into a hair-raising and absurd love, waiting for someone who would be impossible to return to freedom under normal circumstances. man. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is an absolutely public personal act, and he also obtained the permission of Larissa and other relevant personnel. Ten years later, Herz Frank died. His Russian friend Kravchenko obtained the video materials he shot and spent another two years making a documentary called &quot;Beyond Fear (&lt;span style=) &quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;or &quot;Beyond the Fear&quot;, Beyond the Fear&lt;/span>;)》. The film is dedicated to Herz Frank, and it mainly presents his shooting experience. He also appears in more places than Amir and Larissa, but the killer Amir’s sinister expression is impossible for viewers to miss. , which is also the &quot;selling point&quot; of the film. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;All of this content is information that can be searched and compiled, including the public opinion disputes that arose when the film was released. Amir is still in solitary confinement and is prohibited from using communication tools. His brother had some conciliatory words after his release from prison, but Larissa and the rest of Amir&#39;s family have always refused to apologize for his actions. They just hate Rabin and the &quot;Oslo System&quot;, but now that Amir has become a father, Larissa has pushed this love story as far as they can. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/16/7C448riAw5rqKRk8qb6rrQXDepLwLDqaIOApjuEO.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height= &quot;575&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/16/7C448riAw5rqKRk8qb6rrQXDepLwLDqaIOApjuEO.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254186&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Igor Amir&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（云也 retreat/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Rabin His death was a huge wound for Israel. He was deeply loved by the people of Israel. He was self-denial and devoted to public service throughout his life. After his death, he had only a meager birth. Israel has designated November 14th as the anniversary of Rabin’s assassination. Every year on this day, the Labor Party led by Rabin organizes an organization to commemorate him. The crowds at rallies always look back on the past and express their sorrow with silent solemnity. Every year passes. , the speeches of the labor leaders became increasingly concise, no longer talking about the original details in detail, saying only that &quot;we are proud to be members of Rabin&#39;s party&quot; and &quot;we will continue to fight to bring the country on the road to peaceful dialogue.&quot; &quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The left has been in a slump. Even if no one dares to take the initiative to release Amir, right-wing parties have always controlled the political situation and used their tough external voices to prevent people from having any illusions about peace again. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are more things, things that are more important than the ins and outs of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict that anyone can say a few words about, are being ignored. It’s a feeling of exhaustion from thinking and feeling. Every Israeli citizen who looks healthy and sunny is fighting some shadows; every young parent will shrink his smile when thinking about his children having to serve in the compulsory military service in the future; every young and handsome man who looks like he blends in with the tourists The soldiers all have a lot to tell about being attacked, bombed, and killed in action. The relationship between security and danger is not just an opponent, but a neighbor. This seemed to be a foregone conclusion when the Israeli army retook Jerusalem and occupied the West Bank and Gaza through the &quot;Six-Day War&quot;. A poem by Yehuda Amichai best expresses this tension:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;&quot;In the old days On the roof of a house in the city&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;The washed clothes are hung to dry in the afternoon sun:&lt;/ span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;The white sheets of a woman who is my enemy,&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Used by a man who is my enemy&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Italics_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;A towel wiping the sweat off his forehead.&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;People who are &quot;enemies of me&quot; all lead normal lives. The peaceful forces have always emphasized this and have always wanted people to realize this, but the main militant faction has used the opposite narrative: Those who live a normal life are always hostile to me. In Israel, there is a stone erected on the roadside. The Hebrew words on it are about an explosion on a certain day of a certain year. You will know when you see several candle niches on a wall and long-withered garlands on the ground. A shocking and horrific incident occurred there. If there were toys, it would indicate that there were children among the dead. Not to mention that there are various memorial facilities related to the Nazi Holocaust of the last century. Some of them are just a photo wall or a name wall, which you will encounter if you are not paying attention. After various encounters, you will feel that such a small country accommodates too much sadness. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But Israelis will tell you that the worst enemies come from within ourselves. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/16/afLJyhAYjNC7hOz4xJjxGWeAIgiG06N4wISvluJe.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/16/afLJyhAYjNC7hOz4xJjxGWeAIgiG06N4wISvluJe.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254178&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;This is a sculpture commemorating a group of Israeli soldiers who were killed in a suicide attack. Among the many stele sculptures in Israel, it is one of the few with a relatively &quot;high-profile&quot; shape. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（云也 retreat/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;“Enough blood and tears”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt; p>;There are no memorial buildings in Israel that can only be admired from a distance and cannot be approached. In Rabin Square, people can walk casually under the big triangle and pass through the shadows cast by the frames on the ground on a sunny day. Some children who are good at climbing on the fence. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is impossible to see the meaning of this sculpture at a glance, and there is no unified explanation. Just as people&#39;s views, opinions, and attitudes towards Rabin&#39;s death are too diverse to form any natural consensus. Rabin is a good man, and in a 2006 national opinion poll in Israel, he was more revered than founding father David Ben-Gurion and topped the list of &quot;most beloved Israeli Jews.&quot; He was also an outstanding soldier. As Chief of Staff of the National Defense Forces, he played a major role in the victory of the &quot;Six-Day War&quot; in 1967. He was also an excellent diplomat. After the war, he proposed to the then Prime Minister Levi Eshkol to be the ambassador to the United States. Eshkol thought he had heard wrongly. The prime minister was famous for his humor and he was very fond of Latin America. Bing said: &quot;What? You say you want to stand in those long cocktail parties and sit in those annoying banquets? Are you willing to play those boring diplomatic games that diplomats have to play?&quot;&lt; /p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/16/Le2uKYuHBFYILdHnzB4LJIt3l47LY65pcSUupYrx.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1200&quot; height=&quot; 628&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/16/Le2uKYuHBFYILdHnzB4LJIt3l47LY65pcSUupYrx.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254187&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Rabbin in his youth&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（云也 retreat/Picture）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But Rabin wanted to What&#39;s more, the heightened hostility in the Arab world after the disastrous defeat of the &quot;Six-Day War&quot; will inevitably make Israel face a greater threat. The world was split in half during the Cold War. The Soviet Union stood behind the Arab countries. During the &quot;Six-Day War&quot;, Syria, Egypt and Jordan all relied on Soviet arms. So whose support should Israel seek? Of course it&#39;s the United States. Eshkol knew very well that Rabin, who never spoke any official language, became an ambassador for the benefit of the country. After Nixon won the election, Rabin often traveled with the newly appointed Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and became a celebrity in the White House. Not only that, as a core figure of the left-wing Labor Party, he also told his political opponent, the right-wing leader May Nachem Begin said how important diplomacy is to the country: When I do diplomatic work, I must use the adversarial relationship between the Democratic and Republican parties to promote Israel&#39;s interests, otherwise I might as well pack up and leave. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/16/UXp8jodD1S9kyotAeIxrHrNcnEY2xwon3rPshyRM.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height= &quot;528&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/16/UXp8jodD1S9kyotAeIxrHrNcnEY2xwon3rPshyRM.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254183&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Rabin and Clinton&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（云也 retreat/Picture）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The close relationship between the United States and Israel It goes without saying how important connections are to Israel. However, after the 1986 Palestinian uprising known as the first &quot;Intifada&quot; in history, Rabin gradually realized that when the &quot;Six-Day War&quot; enabled the country to take over the West Bank, Gaza and Jerusalem, it also took away these lands. The 1.7 million Palestinians brought in together. What to do with these people? What are their identities? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At that time, Rabin was the defense minister. He convened a group of left-wing writers and poets to learn about the situation of the Palestinians. Among these literati are Oz, AB Yehoshua, and David Grossman. They all believe that blindly ignoring the existence of Palestinians will make the country never have peace. Yehoshua often said with pride afterwards: No head of state would consult a writer on national policy. Rabin joked many times: Every Israeli is teaching me how to be prime minister. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/16/6qkFnYgSHnL33IplsswbR2zIJ9r6HOxvf74VIXTv.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;675&quot; height= &quot;455&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/16/6qkFnYgSHnL33IplsswbR2zIJ9r6HOxvf74VIXTv.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254185&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Grossman, AB Yehoshua, and Amos Oz are the iron triangle of Israeli left-wing writers. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Yun Yehui/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From then to the signing of the Oslo Accords in 1994, Rabin firmly transformed from a war hero Transformed into a peacemaker. In August 1993, Rabin stood side by side with Arafat at the White House and delivered a famous speech entitled &quot;Enough Blood and Tears, Enough.&quot; After that, the management power of the West Bank and Gaza Strip was regarded as Officially handed over to the Palestinian Authority. Looking back at that time, people may think that &quot;land for peace&quot; was indeed what the people wanted in Israel at that time, but in fact, from the conclusion of the Oslo Accords to November 4, 1995, the Israelis were completely divided and targeted Protests and petitions against Rabin and the peace agreement continue one after another, month after month; even a bystander who knows nothing about Middle East affairs and only subconsciously agrees with &quot;peace&quot; will realize that this country Something serious has gone wrong. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Every anti-Rabin person regards himself as the master of the country, and what he says is usually intellectual. Those far-right Jews who have occupied a settlement in the desolate West Bank are only &quot;abominable&quot; and &quot;unreasonable&quot; in the eyes of rational people, but they are not &quot;ignorant&quot;. Everyone has knowledge and can defend their position eloquently. If a person holds a Bible in his hand and talks about the relationship between the Jewish nation and this land for three thousand years, you will definitely feel that he is very knowledgeable. On the other hand, another person, such as Shlomo Sander, the author of the &quot;Fictional Trilogy&quot; and a professor at Tel Aviv University, opened his mouth to refute the various narratives accumulated around the &quot;Holy Land&quot; and argue that &quot;Semiticism&quot; His origins and debunking the myths created by Zionism in the past hundred years, you will definitely be convinced by him, and perhaps deeply moved by his courage. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The atmosphere of debate can be seen everywhere and can be felt since childhood. Children who grow up here learn early on that politics is not a &quot;meat-eater&#39;s plan&quot; but an urgent matter, and any stone with something written on it is a reminder to people to think about something. A person&#39;s habit of having an opinion on everything stems not only from the spiritual tradition accumulated by ancient scriptures and scripture interpretations, but also due to the &quot;oppression&quot; of the public opinion atmosphere. A person must not only form and demonstrate his own position, but also try to refute it. Seemingly profound philosophical creeds such as &quot;the opposite is the movement of the Tao&quot; are often just common sense in practice here. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, politics is not a mental exercise. It requires people to take a stand. As a result of the peace talks and agreements, the atmosphere of hostility suddenly escalated. The official order to withdraw from the occupied territories ignited the hatred of the Jewish settlers there towards the Palestinians, and also made them full of anger towards the Israeli soldiers who came to dismantle the settlements. The confrontation between Israeli military police and black-robed Jews produced many photos that can be recorded in the history of photojournalism. They not only showed the extreme anger of extreme fanatics, but also engraved the internal divisions of a country where everyone is patriotic. Martin Gilbert tells the story of the first extreme suicide attack after the Oslo Accords in &quot;History of Israel&quot;: On January 22, 1995, 20 Israeli soldiers were killed in a series of explosions near Netanya. Die, that&#39;s the work of jihadist groups - no party seems to be satisfied with &quot;peace,&quot; and dissatisfaction can easily escalate into violence. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/16/wdrHPnQ4Es3D5ekZcrkLTFrrTnWRCxIm3GY0O4fk.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/16/wdrHPnQ4Es3D5ekZcrkLTFrrTnWRCxIm3GY0O4fk.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254182&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Common expressions of Palestinian boys in the West Bank. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Yun Yehui/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Rabin used countless speeches to convince the people of the need for peace, but for the warring faction , the peace faction is always surrendering, ruining the future of the nation, and all the contributions Rabin has made to the country in the past can be wiped out. Does he understand this? Did he have a premonition that he was shot minutes after his last speech? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I feel more and more that Rabin’s death was a self-sacrifice: he had been willing to go among the people all his life, not guarding against the crowds surrounding him, and facing them with his shy and blushing face. Eyes of love or hatred. He probably understood that only his own blood could temporarily appease the excited emotions of all parties and interrupt the peace project he was trying to create, perhaps based on fantasy. He must use his own ending to serve as a warning to future generations: He would rather fight to the death with foreign enemies, and would rather spend hundreds of millions of dollars to build the most technologically advanced national defense system, than do so within the country (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: italics, Italics_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;To be precise, it is to cultivate enemies within the Jewish people&lt;/span>;) and stimulate those who have different political views to take action with weapons. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/16/xERYwpe2Vyv2xIHNBNTzU1IARVmlxPt8S1bA31Xu.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/16/xERYwpe2Vyv2xIHNBNTzU1IARVmlxPt8S1bA31Xu.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254181&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In the Old City of Jerusalem, you can see many people who do not seem to belong to the &quot;Jewish state&quot; of Israel. From this, you may have an idea of ​​the meaning of the &quot;Holy City&quot; comprehended. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Yun Yehui/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;He is a tragedy&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; There are many tragedies caused by &quot;historical issues&quot; that will fade away with the passage of time. The most typical ones are the riots and wars in Algeria that started in 1952 and ended twelve years later, and the war in Afghanistan that started in 1979. It also lasted for ten years. These past events seem to have been turned over, and salvaging them is also the work of some writers and researchers who believe in humanitarianism. In particular, the pain they caused at that time was not universal. For many French and Russians, Tragic things are far beyond one&#39;s perception. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But in Israel, where the space is small, and in the ancient city where the enemy is drying laundry opposite one&#39;s home, nothing will really turn the page; events are always current events, not a repeat or replica of what happened back then. Prepared for it: prepared for calm to enter the bomb shelter, prepared for sadness at the news of the killings. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Shlomo Sander once told me that the direct impetus for him to write &quot;The Fictional Jewish Nation&quot; was his sympathy for the situation of Palestinian students who were struggling in this country. Lack of &quot;at home&quot;; Sander deeply understands their pain. In this book, he demonstrates that the Palestinians who were driven out at that time are the true descendants of the ancient Israelites in the &quot;biblical era&quot;. He also said that the apartment where his home is located was a Palestinian village before the establishment of the state of Israel and had its own Arabic name. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course Sander will not take the lead in exiting his own house. He was just doing what a scholar should do. Although he has endured attacks, reviles and even life threats from his enemies on the right, Sander is not alone. In Israel, he and others of all stripes continued to think, write, and publish. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Democracy is also the biggest concession that Israel has made for its &quot;occupied&quot; land. In other &quot;one land, two peoples&quot; cases, horrific ethnic cleansing has occurred, but not in Israel; despite Zygmunt Bauman&#39;s sneer that there can be no enlightenment as long as there is occupation, Israel has sent troops in the past When suppressing Palestinian unrest, tanks were never fired at surrounding crowds. Tragedies have occurred when countries such as Syria, Jordan, and Algeria suppressed rebellions. Making this kind of comparison now feels a bit &quot;excessive&quot;, but it is also different now than before. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/16/gsKDXkKztV2yZeInYf2wcWViMJqrQwJTyj2qg6BN.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/16/gsKDXkKztV2yZeInYf2wcWViMJqrQwJTyj2qg6BN.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254179&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Israeli mother and child&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（云也 retreat/Picture）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is a &quot; The &quot;Impossible Triangle&quot; stands at the center of Israeli politics, with its three corners being land, security and democracy. Israel has wanted all three since 1967, but in fact it can only get two: if it wants land and democracy, it means sacrificing security; if it wants democracy and security, it must give up land; if it wants security and land, it Democracy must be abandoned, that is, the civil rights of non-Jewish people in the current population must be denied, and all voices of internal and external dissatisfaction must be silenced. This triangle can be used to explain the strange sculpture commemorating Prime Minister Rabin: Rabin decided to give up the land for the sake of security and democracy, and died here. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Let people freely &quot;pass&quot; the unstable inverted triangle and feel its meaning. This design also reflects the principle of democracy. When talking about Rabin with older Israelis, they will all say, &quot;He is a tragedy.&quot; But what kind of tragedy it is, and what is right and wrong, they won&#39;t say. It’s not that they dare not say it, but that they have long accepted all arguments about it. This is their way of understanding the tragedy and then moving on. Life is about &quot;passing&quot; every event and moment to form your own experience and your own thinking. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/16/f9hLCsRfEcEHcR5MnF9SN7OzMZm8pEOG4l3ek3bW.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1015&quot; height= &quot;661&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/16/f9hLCsRfEcEHcR5MnF9SN7OzMZm8pEOG4l3ek3bW.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254184&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Karavan&#39;s work &quot;The Road to Peace&quot;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（云也 retreat/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p >;The sculptor Dani Karavan, who died two years ago, created many profound works in Israel’s deserts, cities and borders.

In 2016, at the screening of Qin Xiaoyue&#39;s first film &quot;The World and Me&quot;, Fang Junrui stayed until the end, blushing and stammering, telling Qin Xiaoyue that he wanted to restore cultural relics, but reality did not allow it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Looking at this peer who was a bit socially anxious and stuttered, Qin Xiaoyue noticed that there was a strong dramatic tension in his expression. Fang Junrui said that doing cultural relic restoration work requires a certain financial foundation. He feels that his family&#39;s conditions are not enough to support him, but at the same time, he is also very proud that his family has a house next to Jing&#39;an Temple in Shanghai. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Qin Xiaoyue and the photographer entered the family with cameras. It was a 30-square-meter husband&#39;s house, where Jun Rui, born in 1985, lived with his parents, who were over 70 years old. The largest room is the living room, which is also Fang Junrui&#39;s bedroom. It has a bed, a dining table, and a recliner for his father to watch TV. Fang Junrui kept buying books on art, religion, and literature, filling the gaps in the furniture. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/16/nLfPZpNxPpSyvbnEnr1Z1qlv5M4Kk9o9uWXdqP95.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;2400&quot; height= &quot;1346&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/16/nLfPZpNxPpSyvbnEnr1Z1qlv5M4Kk9o9uWXdqP95.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254135&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Differences in concepts and dependence in life are the daily life of Fang Junrui (middle) and his parents. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of interviewee)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fang Junrui was deeply influenced by his father who loved calligraphy and painting. When he was in college, he chose cultural relics. Professional restoration. After graduation, the father and son discovered that this was an industry that required high academic qualifications and strong financial support. In the two years after graduating in 2014, Fang Junrui not only failed to find a suitable job, but none of the other jobs he found lasted more than three months. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Father continued to support Fang Junrui, helped him pay the high tuition fees, and signed up for a master class in cultural relic restoration. Fang Junrui took it intermittently and also repaired a bowl, but he never finished it. Constantly hitting the wall swallowed up Fang Junrui&#39;s hope. He fell into depression and melancholy, indulged in pure fantasy, and lived a life that was reversed day and night. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fang Junrui’s father did not live the life he wanted when he was young. He liked painting, but failed to make it a career; he wrote good poems and articles, but he was depressed for a long time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Qin Xiaoyue originally planned to film the mental journey of a boy who loves the restoration of cultural relics. But as soon as she stepped into their home, she felt that this expectation was completely disappointed. The camera was like a match, igniting the conflicts they had suppressed for many years. In the first few shoots, apart from quarrels, there was almost nothing captured. The direction of the film has completely changed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At a post-screening talk in Guangzhou on September 16, 2023, an audience member asked about the reason for the naming of &quot;The Nest&quot;. In his understanding, &quot;The Nest&quot; is closer to people&#39;s imagination of a beautiful family, but The film shows a trapped family, which reminded him of a &quot;cage.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;The nest is not only the feeling of a very warm family, but also the feeling of always living under the wings of the parents, and the expectation that he will always fantasize about when he can leave the nest.&quot; Qin Xiaoyue responded. , &quot;His spiritual world is also a nest. He used these books to build a nest for his spiritual world, which is in great contrast with the nest in the real world.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http: //images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/16/xmmNdStZYSWXd9bozcBbEz9YRx1Qq9If6NXgrhGy.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;2400&quot; height=&quot;1350&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm. com/cms/medias/image/23/10/16/xmmNdStZYSWXd9bozcBbEz9YRx1Qq9If6NXgrhGy.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254133&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Thirty Fang Junrui, who is many years old, lives with his parents, who are over 70 years old, in an old house of 30 square meters. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of interviewee)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu Wenrong, a researcher at the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences, has been investigating the intergenerational dynamics of Chinese society for more than ten years Regarding relationship issues, in her opinion, &quot;The Nest&quot; shows typical family intergenerational relationships during the transition period: &quot;Although parents are very unhappy, in fact, the children in this structure are also very unhappy. The reason why everyone resonates is Because the film reflects the current common dilemma of young people growing up, they all feel that they have a strong pursuit of self-realization but are powerless. From a sociological perspective, this phenomenon is a phenomenon unique to us when modernization and social development have reached a certain stage. The result of the intergenerational solidarity culture of familism and the culture of parent-child integration.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Triangle&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;When photographing this family, Qin Xiao wanted to explore more and more, the people living under the same roof Although they clearly hurt and tortured each other, what allowed them to continue living together. In an interview with a reporter from Southern Weekend, she revealed her answer: &quot;Maybe they have very little and only have each other. If they throw away even this, they will have nothing.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The three of them rarely go out. When traveling, your social circle is also narrow. Except for the occasional visit by her mother to visit relatives, most of the time they spend all day in each other&#39;s home. Qin Xiaoyue described this family as a &quot;stable triangular structure&quot;, &quot;everyone is dependent and tortured.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The negative attitude common in East Asian families is passed down from generation to generation. Fang Junrui&#39;s grandfather was imprisoned for offending a prison guard when he was young, and his father looked down upon him very much. During the &quot;Cultural Revolution&quot;, his father encountered the &quot;Going to the Countryside Movement&quot; and needed to go to the frontier. As soon as the mobilization people came, he ran away, forming a Fang Junrui also looked down on his father because of his evasive and fearful temperament. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;My father often communicated with Fang Junrui in a suppressive way. When Fang Junrui complained that he could not find his ideal job, his father would say that he had suffered so many injustices and the conditions were so difficult, but he still came through and still insisted on painting. He accused his son of not working hard and only sleeping all day long. , don’t fight for it. Fang Junrui talked about his reading scope and said that sculpture is also one of the areas of interest. His father started by saying: &quot;Sculpture? Do you know sculpture? What do you know?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This made Fang Junrui in The already cramped home made him feel even more suffocated. He collapsed several times in front of the camera and even threatened to commit suicide. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But at the same time, the care in life is meticulous. Every month, Fang Junrui can get 3,000 yuan from his father. When he needs it, food and clean towels will always be handed to him. When the unpacked books are thrown on the ground, someone will help pick them up. Despite the suffering, Fang Junrui never chose to leave his parents and live alone. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After watching &quot;The Nest&quot;, someone shared his understanding with Qin Xiaoyue: The father has never had a sense of presence in society, so he has to make up for it in educating his son. He tried to set rules for the cat he adopted at home, but the cat was not tamed after being beaten, and continued to pace calmly around the dinner table. Fang Junrui is also &quot;immune&quot; to his father&#39;s advice. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Facing the camera, the mother does not have as strong a desire to express herself as the father and son. Most of the time, she silently takes care of the housework. The adopted cats came and went, and while the mother fed them food, she lovingly called each one by the name she had given them. &quot;It seems that my mother has always been a person with infinite care, but she actually swallowed her grievances most of the time.&quot; Qin Xiaoyue remembered that later in the filming, perhaps because of the camera, Fang Junrui&#39;s mother confided all her grievances He came out and pointed at the camera, &quot;Let them judge.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fang Junrui&#39;s mother angrily told her father and son that she wanted to leave them and travel by herself, but in the end she fell back on &quot;If you don&#39;t go, I won&#39;t go.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/16/oHoWXRS2kU0yhyYIHBRaK0XY0aGSqqpoY0EefXS1.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;2400&quot; height= &quot;1350&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/16/oHoWXRS2kU0yhyYIHBRaK0XY0aGSqqpoY0EefXS1.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254132&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Fang Junrui’s mother. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of interviewee)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the film, Fang Junrui’s mother revealed a past incident. Fang Junrui went to junior high school. I once asked to raise a puppy, but my father didn&#39;t agree. She believes that since this incident, her originally bright son &quot;has lost his mind and has become broken.&quot; The two of them, both in their 40s, had a son at an old age, and they doted on Fang Junrui, especially their father, who almost always responded to his requests since childhood. Qin Xiaoyue guessed that Fang Junrui was not satisfied in this matter, could not consider the problem from other people&#39;s point of view, could not accept his father&#39;s rejection, and his temper may have become paranoid. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Qin Xiaoyue has a younger brother who is more than ten years younger than her and is also loved by her parents. She sometimes uses this to warn her parents. &quot;But I think from the perspective of parents, sometimes there seems to be nothing they can do. They are just manipulated by their children. When you care too much about someone, it is difficult for you to control it, and your life will become more and more out of control. A point that cannot be resolved, and then they are together in pain.&quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The appearance of the camera allowed the family to burst out their long-pent-up emotions, and also exposed that the parents have completely different views on educating their sons. Attitude. The father also wanted to use the camera to help his son wake up and change, but the mother thought that it was useless to talk to him, and stimulating him in front of the camera would only make him more confused. At the end of the documentary, the mother said that selling the old house would be enough for her son to live on for a lifetime. The parents&#39; attitudes towards Fang Junrui were like two winds blowing in opposite directions, canceling each other out. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After Fang Junrui quit his security job, he went for air testing. The mother muttered to the father: &quot;Do you have to stand all the time for air testing? It will be very hard.&quot; The father said bluntly: &quot;You are such a strange person. At the same time, you are worried that he will not be able to endure hardship, and now you are afraid that he will endure hardship.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p >;&quot;He is very adaptable in such an environment. He just does his own thing, and someone takes care of him every day. About whether he is awake, the meaning of life, and the motivation of life, such high-level talk falls back to everyone. The day&#39;s schedule still consists of eating wontons, cooking, and three meals a day.&quot; Qin Xiaoyue told Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Considering that Fang Junrui might get married in the future, the two elders bought an affordable house in Jiading, far away from the city center. Not long ago, they just moved Fang Junrui&#39;s books to their new house. Qin Xiaoyue hopes to take footage of Fang Junrui or his parents moving out of the old house in the future, which means that there is a high possibility of a breakthrough in the family&#39;s stable structure. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Two generations&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The Fang family’s ancestors had a prosperous past. During the Republic of China, Fang Junrui’s great-grandfathers moved to Shanghai, opened a rickshaw company, worked as compradors, and lived a prosperous life. A life that is the envy of others. When the Japanese invaded Shanghai, their family fled from Hongkou to the banks of the Suzhou River. They experienced ups and downs in the turbulent times, and by Fang Junrui&#39;s father&#39;s generation, they were completely in decline. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In stark contrast to the cramped and gray physical space, is the family’s spiritual world. His father loved painting and could write modern poetry, and his mother also read traditional vertical poetry. Fang Junrui was influenced by his ears and eyes, and inherited his interest in literature, history and art. When Fang Junrui took the college entrance examination, it was his father who first discovered &quot;cultural relic restoration&quot; while applying for the major. He spent his monthly salary and the money given by his father to buy books, and talked about Catholic culture and art with his fellow believers in a clear and logical manner. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Qin Xiaoyue&#39;s view, the fates of Fang Junrui and his father are &quot;very similar and parallel.&quot; Fang’s father liked painting since he was a child, but he did not have the opportunity to engage in related work. For twenty years, he worked as a waiter in public bathrooms. However, he never gave up this hobby. He would draw at home when he had time. When talents could flow, he switched jobs to work as an artist in a hospital. His main job was to publish blackboard newspapers. He waited until he was allocated a house at the age of 40 before he began to consider getting married and having children. He often says similar words: &quot;How many people can really live an ideal life?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Unlike his parents&#39; generation who could just take things as they come, Fang Junrui made no secret of the fact that he &quot;wasn&#39;t born with the right luck.&quot; With a sense of &quot;time&quot;, he found a place to blame for his rough life, imagining that if he had good material conditions, he could engage in restoration of cultural relics, get married and have children smoothly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In my father’s view, if there are no conditions or a house, how can we have friends or get married? Fang Junrui believes that having a house to live in and being able to get married are basic needs that everyone should realize. &quot;Can only rich people get married?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/16/4pw8RKm9m8gWpUK751TTxThDO734K3g89DSUOZRg.jpg&quot; border =&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;2400&quot; height=&quot;1350&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/16/4pw8RKm9m8gWpUK751TTxThDO734K3g89DSUOZRg.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254134&quot; >;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Fang Junrui (right) and his father (left) argue about personal experiences. Stills from the documentary &quot;The Nest&quot;. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Picture provided by the film producer)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu Wenrong analyzed: &quot;My father and he have similar personal ideals, and they are very concerned about career, aesthetics, and There are similarities in the pursuit of art, but because they grew up in different stages of social development, they chose different paths in life. The father put survival first, but the son did not compromise on the path of self-realization and ideal pursuit. They are giants The conflict is the common characteristic of those disunited and disharmonious &#39;cheating&#39; families - the values ​​cannot match, and the instrumental support of the two generations becomes emotional binding and moral kidnapping.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The father and son suffered similar fates at the same age - due to various reasons, they were unable to live their ideal lives. But instead of cherishing each other, the two built high walls. Fang&#39;s father inspired Fang Junrui with his own life experience. The latter did not accept this trick at all and felt that it was nothing special. In the eyes of Fang&#39;s father, Fang Junrui is completely unable to take care of himself, and the restoration of cultural relics is just empty talk with high ambitions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Qin Xiaoyue pointed out that the turbulent times that Fang’s father experienced had destroyed his outlook on life, his feelings about life, and his entire inner order. This resulted in almost all of his cognitions and expressions being passive and conservative. Fang Junrui, like many of his contemporaries, &quot;has not experienced any great pain. He has witnessed the most rapid development stage of the motherland, and has been influenced by many foreign cultures. He has more opportunities and sees more possibilities.&quot; , not very good at setting limits for myself.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The biggest difference between Fang Junrui and his parents is that the latter&#39;s living situation is that the whole family has no food if they don&#39;t work, while the former has enough food and clothing, and works more for self-realization. When Fang Junrui&#39;s ambitions could not be put into practice in society, he was neither willing nor able to immerse himself in survival and accept a mediocre and trivial life like his parents. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The quality of life of those born in the 1980s and 1990s is much higher than that of their parents’ generation. This is the core change in the growth environment of the two generations and the source of intergenerational conflict. Similar to Fang Junrui and his parents, the gap and cognitive differences between generations are common. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Communication is very important. When communication is not in place, this situation may occur in their family. It feels like they say these words out of love, but these words cannot reach the other person&#39;s heart at all. The relationship is there.&quot; Qin Xiaoyue said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Qin Xiaoyue also suffered from the rejection of his parents. At that time, she returned from studying abroad, traveled around China by train, and started making documentaries. In the parents&#39; minds, after their daughter has tried what she wants to do, she should honestly find a class, preferably a TV station or a newspaper, where she will be stable and respectable. Unexpectedly, after Qin Xiaoyue worked on &quot;The Nest&quot; for five or six years, they couldn&#39;t figure out why their daughter &quot;jumped into a bigger pit again.&quot; During post-production, she had a conflict with her parents. Her mother said to her, &quot;If you continue like this, you will become Fang Junrui.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Qin Xiaoyue looks back on this journey. He has earned every support from his family on his own. If there are achievements in this area, it will best dispel their worries. If there are no results yet, he must at least have enthusiasm and action to impress them. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The film has been screened in Shanghai, Guangzhou, Hangzhou and other cities. In each scene, Qin Xiaoyue will receive direct resonance from the audience, such as thinking of the way his father speaks, and a friend&#39;s family is similar to it. etc. This is exactly what she hopes for - the audience can stop pointing fingers at the characters and use the film as a mirror to reflect their own problems. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;A bowl&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Fang Junrui never repaired the bowl. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During the first filming, his father asked him to show the bowl to Qin Xiaoyue and the others, and encouraged him to repair the bowl. Maybe the master thought it was good and would be willing to accept him as a disciple. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For the second filming, my father &quot;exposed&quot; Fang Junrui in front of the camera - if he really liked the restoration of cultural relics, this bowl would have been repaired long ago. Qin Xiaoyue followed what he said and waited until he repaired the bowl before coming over to take pictures next time. Fang Junrui&#39;s eyes changed and he directly stated that it was impossible to make an inspirational film through him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/16/GY6u8OiCDlnQ6KS2IMfU1RXi2DpztTHqBwJYdyyX.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;2400&quot; height= &quot;1350&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/16/GY6u8OiCDlnQ6KS2IMfU1RXi2DpztTHqBwJYdyyX.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254131&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Fang Junrui has not repaired the bowl for a long time. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of interviewee)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Why can’t Fang Junrui repair this small bowl? The audience gave a psychological understanding: for him, the bowl is a symbol of the ideal. If he does not practice, the ideal will always exist; if he practices it, he fails to repair it, or after finishing it, he still cannot find anything related to it. work, then his ideals will be shattered. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The filming and production cycle of &quot;The Nest&quot; far exceeded Qin Xiaoyue&#39;s plan. She feels that this film is her bowl. &quot;You really want to do something, and you are very good at doing it, but you have never done it. At this time, you will feel that your life is out of control, and your life path is not what you imagined. It will produce a kind of self-doubt.&quot; In her opinion, the film was made by accident. If it had not been made, she would have been in a very helpless state. &quot;If I were absolutely sure about this, I would not do it. Hurry up. Changing careers may not be so painful.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the film won the Best Documentary Award at the Frist Youth Film Festival, it received a lot of attention, including many workers in the field of cultural relic restoration. Qin Xiaoyue suggested that Fang Junrui take this opportunity Repair the bowl to prove his ability to those who care about him. Fang Junrui responded to her, so what if it was repaired, and he had no time at all now. &quot;Actually, work also has weekends. He was completely immersed in negative emotions and couldn&#39;t get out.&quot; Qin Xiaoyue said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The entry barrier for cultural relic restoration is high, and graduate school is usually required, with mentors leading the way. After watching the film, Fang Junrui’s college classmates told Qin Xiaoyue that no one among their classmates had entered the field of cultural relic restoration after graduation. Fang Junrui has tried many jobs, including real estate registration, technical worker, hospital security, etc., but it was always difficult to continue due to work ability, interpersonal relationships, personal wishes and other reasons. Struggling with income and housing issues, he couldn&#39;t find a partner. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu Wenrong, who grew up in the late 1970s, observed that it is difficult for young people today to be &quot;down to earth&quot;. This change in mentality is closely related to the entire social information environment. “The network and information dissemination are too developed, giving people a strong sense of powerlessness. The people they refer to are always the best people, and they have no way to control the people around them. People and things, including those who are satisfied with themselves, live a very unhappy life.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fang Junrui wanted to live a better life, and imagined that such a life existed in the glorious years of his ancestors. But he couldn&#39;t see that the stagnant life in front of him would be loosened in the short term, and he lost his ability to move. Four or five years passed on the screen, and until the end of the film, almost nothing had been resolved. The bowl had not been repaired, a suitable job had not been found, family relations had not eased, and there had been no love or marriage. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before meeting Fang Junrui, Qin Xiaoyue believed that everyone should live the life they want. He defied her expectations and never became a heroic figure. After struggling for a long time, Qin Xiaoyue accepted this sense of loss and accepted that anyone can be a mediocre person. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I think what his dad said is right. If you really love something, you will actually try more and won&#39;t give up so easily, but no one can To really empathize with him, for example, it would be unfair for him to say this.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She turned to explore the reasons and tried to use documentaries to show part of the answers. The film has been cut one version after another, like answers that are hesitant to speak. The current version involves many issues such as family, destiny, and ideals. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Maybe no one can explain clearly, (the reason) is comprehensive. He has certain personal reasons.

However, research by physicists has shown that, corresponding to matter, there is antimatter in the universe, and they have been exploring this for nearly a hundred years. On September 27, 2023, the ALPHA collaboration group at CERN published a paper in Nature, announcing their latest research results on antimatter. In their experiments, they found that antihydrogen atoms would fall freely under the influence of gravity, which is the same way that matter moves under the influence of gravity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Jeffrey Hangst, spokesman for the ALPHA collaboration, professor of physics at Aarhus University in Denmark and one of the corresponding authors of the paper, said: &quot;This is the first time that direct The experimental observation of the effect of gravity on the motion of antimatter is a milestone in the history of antimatter research.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;The Mystery of Antimatter&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In 1928, British physicist Paul Dirac proposed the Dirac equation, predicting the existence of antimatter. In his theory, there is a particle that has the same properties as electrons except that it is electrically opposite to electrons. This particle was later named positron. In 1932, American physicist Carl Anderson discovered the positron predicted by Dirac in an experiment, for which he won the 1936 Nobel Prize in Physics. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After antimatter was discovered, physicists began to study the properties of antimatter and think about the relationship between antimatter and gravity. In 1915, Einstein proposed the general theory of relativity, establishing the most successful theory of gravity to date. From the observation of a solar eclipse in 1919 to the discovery of gravitational waves in 2015, the predictions of general relativity have been continuously confirmed over a century and have withstood the test of a series of experiments. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When Einstein proposed the general theory of relativity, physicists including him did not know the existence of antimatter. But in general relativity, objects of the same mass experience the same gravitational pull, regardless of their intrinsic structure or properties. Therefore, matter and antimatter should experience the same gravitational pull. Some past experiments have shown that gravity acts equally on matter and antimatter, but these experiments only proved this indirectly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For decades, physicists have hoped to study this problem through direct experiments. The ALPHA collaboration team completed such a direct experiment this time. Before Einstein, Newton established a successful theory of gravity. The story that he was hit by a falling apple and came up with the law of universal gravitation is a well-known story. Although this is just a story, the question physicists hope to study in this experiment can be understood as: In a world composed of antimatter, would an apple still fall and hit Newton? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Physicists explore the movement of antimatter under the influence of gravity, and also hope to answer a key question related to the evolution of the universe. According to the Big Bang theory, equal amounts of matter and antimatter should have been produced when the Big Bang occurred. However, these matter and antimatter did not undergo annihilation but were all converted into energy, and we live in a universe today that is almost entirely composed of matter. This is known as the &quot;matter-antimatter asymmetry mystery&quot; and is one of the biggest mysteries in physics today. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Based on the general theory of relativity, most physicists believe that antimatter and matter should have the same behavior under the influence of gravity; however, some physicists support the antigravity theory and believe that antimatter does not move in the direction of matter under the influence of gravity. Instead of falling down, it flew upward in the opposite direction. In this way, at the beginning of the formation of the universe, matter and antimatter would move in opposite directions under the influence of gravity. After 13.8 billion years of evolution, the existence of antimatter will not be detected in the universe we live in today, so we can Solve the mystery of matter-antimatter asymmetry. Therefore, if physicists directly observe the difference between the motion of antimatter under gravity and the difference between matter in experiments, they will obtain important clues to solve this problem and even trigger a subversive revolution in physics. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/16/K7ailcllYDo1AWdMUCbOt5Pwgf9hTsY5dPD2VcPs.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/16/K7ailcllYDo1AWdMUCbOt5Pwgf9hTsY5dPD2VcPs.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254167&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Staff are installing the ALPHA-g instrument. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(CERN/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Making antimatter&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The most common thing with Newton Like the famous &quot;story&quot;, Galileo, the pioneer of gravity theory, completed the experiment of two iron balls falling to the ground at the same time at the Leaning Tower of Pisa, thereby overturning Aristotle&#39;s law of falling bodies. This is also a story fabricated by later generations. However, if you want to study the motion of antimatter under the influence of gravity, physicists will naturally think of using a falling object experiment to examine whether antimatter follows the same laws of gravity as matter. However, although this idea is theoretically feasible, it is very difficult in experiments. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is a gravitational force between any two objects with mass. Among the four known basic forces in nature, gravity is the force with the longest range and therefore plays the most important role in the evolution of the universe and the interaction of celestial bodies. However, gravity is the weakest force among the four forces. For particles with extremely small masses, the effect of gravity is minimal. For example, for an antiproton, the force exerted by an electric field of 1V/m is 40 trillion times greater than the gravitational force exerted by the Earth. Therefore, if charged antimatter particles are used as experimental objects, it is almost impossible to complete experiments to test the effect of gravity. Researchers can only choose electrically neutral antimatter particles. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Antihydrogen atom is the antimatter corresponding to the hydrogen atom, consisting of a positron surrounding an antiproton. It is both the simplest antimatter atom and an electrically neutral and stable antimatter particle. These properties make antihydrogen atoms the best choice for studying the gravitational behavior of antimatter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Currently, physicists obtain antimatter particles in the laboratory. For example, the particles produced in high-energy particle collisions all appear in pairs, with one matter particle corresponding to one antimatter particle. But combining antimatter particles together to form antiatoms is very difficult because antimatter particles usually have very short lifespans. When an antimatter particle meets its corresponding matter particle, they annihilate and are converted into energy. In a world made of matter, it would be difficult for antimatter particles to meet and combine into antiatoms. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Therefore, although antihydrogen atoms are the simplest antimatter atoms, currently only CERN in the world can create antihydrogen atoms, where physicists use the Antihydrogen Laser Physics Instrument. Physics Apparatus, ALPHA) conducts research on antimatter. Researchers from the ALPHA collaboration obtained antiprotons through high-speed proton collisions. After that, a speed reducer called ELENA can slow down the antiprotons enough for physicists to proceed. At CERN, several experiments studying antimatter rely on ELENA to provide easily controllable antiprotons, including this experiment. At the same time, they collected positrons from the radioactive source. Next, they combined the two to create antihydrogen atoms. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Falling Antimatter&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;After obtaining the antihydrogen atoms, the researchers pushed them into a 3-meter-high shaft, a device called As ALPHA-g, where &quot;g&quot; represents the acceleration due to gravity. The shaft is surrounded by superconducting electromagnetic coils to prevent antimatter from coming into contact with matter and causing annihilation. The researchers allowed the hotter antihydrogen atoms in the shaft to escape, so that the antihydrogen gas in the shaft became cooler, only 0.5°C above absolute zero. The remaining antihydrogen atoms move very slowly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Next, the researchers gradually weakened the magnetic field at the top and bottom of the shaft, which is equivalent to opening the lid and bottom of a jar. When antihydrogen atoms escape and annihilate, the researchers used two sensors to measure where the annihilation occurred. In the experiment, they trapped about 100 antihydrogen atoms at a time in the shaft and then released them over 20 seconds by gradually reducing the current in magnets at the top and bottom of the shaft. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In our daily life, if a gas container is opened, the gas inside will escape in all directions. However, the antihydrogen atoms are moving very slowly at this time. If antimatter and matter are subject to the same form of gravity, then the earth&#39;s gravity will have an obvious effect at this moment: most of the antihydrogen atoms should escape from the bottom, and a small number will escape from the bottom. The top escapes. Computer simulations show that for matter, this operation would result in about 20 percent of the atoms escaping from the top of the shaft, and about 80 percent from the bottom. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The researchers conducted seven experiments in this study. In each experiment, the size of the bias magnetic field was different. This magnetic field can either strengthen or cancel gravity. By averaging the results of seven experiments, the ALPHA collaboration found that the ratio of antihydrogen atoms escaping the shaft from the top to the bottom was consistent with simulations. After calculation, they gave a value of 0.75 ± 0.29 g for the gravitational acceleration experienced by antihydrogen atoms, where g is the local gravitational acceleration. Therefore, they concluded that within the current measurement accuracy, the acceleration of antihydrogen atoms is consistent with the acceleration of matter caused by Earth&#39;s gravity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2010, the team led by Hanst successfully trapped antihydrogen atoms for the first time in history. In 2016, they successfully measured how antiatoms absorb light. But the complexity of the gravity experiment is unprecedented. As he said: &quot;This is the most difficult thing we have done so far.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although there are still certain errors in this experiment, the researchers believe that, They can at least conclusively rule out the possibility that gravity has a repulsive effect on antimatter, which means that the antigravity theory cannot be established. From this we can confirm that in the world of antimatter, the apple also falls downward, and may hit the &quot;Newton&quot; in that world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The ALPHA collaboration team plans to conduct more precise measurements in 2024, with an accuracy that will reach 100 times that of this experiment. &quot;We&#39;ve spent 30 years learning how to make antiatoms, how to make them persist, and how to control them well enough so that we can make them fall under the influence of gravity,&quot; Hanst said. &quot;The next step is to make them as possible as possible Accurately measure this acceleration. We hope to verify that both matter and antimatter fall in the same way.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The results announced by the ALPHA collaboration team this time are an expected discovery, but as Han &quot;This is still a landmark achievement,&quot; Ste said. Physics is an experimental science, and verifying theoretical conjectures through experiments is the core part of it. Through this experiment, physicists not only verified previous conjectures, but also laid an important foundation for the study of neutral antimatter. In the study of antimatter starting from this starting point, some unexpected discoveries may be made, thereby rewriting our understanding of the formation and evolution of matter and antimatter, and truly solving one of the biggest mysteries in physics. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 16 Oct 2023 17:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[迄今最全面的人类脑细胞图谱丨科创要闻]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258680]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-16 15:20:07&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/16/YITFib0yT0s4rxY2Bs1TS5zYtbV9xqDzqrtGnZze.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1408&quot; height=&quot;698&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/16/YITFib0yT0s4rxY2Bs1TS5zYtbV9 xqDzqrtGnZze. png&quot; data-key=&quot;254152&quot; data-mce-width=&quot;0&quot; data-mce-height=&quot;0&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;&lt;strong>;Technical News&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;p >;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/collections/brain-cell-census&quot;>;&lt;strong>;【01】The most comprehensive human brain cell atlas to date&lt;/strong>;&lt;/a>;&lt;/p >; &lt;p>;On October 13, &quot;Science&quot; released the special topic &quot;Brain&amp;nbsp;Cell&amp;nbsp;Census&quot;, and 21 research papers were simultaneously published in &quot;Science&quot; and its sub-journal &quot;Science&amp;nbsp&quot; Advances) and Science Translational Medicine (12, 8, and 1 articles were published respectively), sharing the most comprehensive brain cell atlas of human and non-human primates to date. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These results come from the &quot;Brain Project-Cell Census Network&quot; project, abbreviated as BICCN (BRAIN&amp;nbsp;Initiative&amp;nbsp; Cell&amp;nbsp;Census&amp;nbsp;Network).

We have been taught since childhood that it is a virtue to have the courage to face mistakes and correct them. However, in real life, some people regard virtue as a broom. Not only do they not correct their mistakes, but they also make them knowingly and add to their mistakes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It rained in the afternoon, so I went to take the bus and found that the seat I wanted to sit in was occupied by a wet umbrella, so I had to find another seat. The same thing happened to the passengers who came up later. They wanted to sit in that seat but had to find another seat when they saw an umbrella. One of the old men had difficulty moving and had to stumble to the last row to sit down. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The sight of the old man walking with difficulty made people feel pitiful. An old man couldn&#39;t stand it anymore and asked the umbrella owner why he didn&#39;t pick up the umbrella. The umbrella owner explained that there were no other passengers when she got on the bus. She was answering the phone at the time, so she conveniently placed the umbrella on the seat. The old man continued to question, saying that the umbrella was wet and it was common sense not to put it on the seat. The owner of the umbrella argued again and again that the seat was wet anyway and he couldn&#39;t sit on it. The two argued over and over again. After the surrounding passengers lined up for the old man, the umbrella owner suddenly changed her face and said arrogantly that she could put her umbrella wherever she wanted and that it was none of the old man&#39;s business. She also mocked the old man for not being able to afford an umbrella. Fortunately, the surrounding passengers reconciled the situation and the bus happened to arrive at the platform where the old man got off, otherwise a bigger dispute might have erupted between the two parties. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the old man got off the bus, the old man sitting in the last row criticized him for being meddlesome, and some of his words were unpleasant. This really surprised the passengers. The old man obviously complained about the grievance when he saw that he was also an elderly man and had difficulty moving. Unexpectedly, he didn&#39;t appreciate it and even stabbed him. Seeing that someone was helping her, the umbrella owner talked about her reasons for letting the umbrella go, emphasizing that she had always been a disciplined person outside. She didn&#39;t shut up until a passenger asked her if she had bought a ticket for the umbrella, but she still didn&#39;t pick up the umbrella. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It’s a very small thing. I believe that most people will pick up the umbrella immediately when they are reminded that they should not put the umbrella on the seat. A simple action can avoid a heated dispute. Why wouldn&#39;t the umbrella owner refuse? There were no other passengers when she got on the bus. The umbrella was placed on the seat and it was not in the way. She thought it was reasonable to put the umbrella up. This was her first explanation. This is also the first reaction of some people when faced with their own mistakes. They do not correct the mistakes immediately, but look for rationalizations for the mistakes from their own perspective, standpoint and safeguarding their own interests. The more sufficient the reason is, the more self-justifying it is, the more it feels that it should be understood, and the more it feels that it is not wrong, so naturally there is no question of correcting the error. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The second explanation given by the umbrella owner is that the seat has been wet and cannot be sat on. Fait accompli cannot be changed. Although it seems reasonable on the surface, it actually implies arrogance. This arrogance is related to environmental shaping. From childhood to adulthood, it is common for children to admit mistakes to their parents, students to their teachers, employees to their leaders, and subordinates to their superiors, but not vice versa. The subconscious mind that the strong and the powerful are justified is deep-rooted. From the umbrella owner&#39;s subsequent words, we can see her superiority and arrogance, that is, it is normal for my umbrella to be placed on the seat, and none of you have the right to criticize me. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It takes courage to admit mistakes and correct them, and it takes even more courage to find mistakes and point them out. The historical allusion of Wei Zheng&#39;s blunt remonstrance has been passed down to this day, and we also know that &quot;it is enough to have one admonishing friend in life.&quot; However, in real life, people like flowers and applause far more than good medicine and criticism. Those who correct errors are often lonely, because their coming forward not only makes the wrongdoers feel resentful because they have no way to hide their mistakes, but also reflects the cowardice and cowardice of bystanders and beneficiaries, making them feel ashamed. The old man’s criticism is an example. If the old man heard what he said, would he come forward to correct his mistakes next time? If there are fewer people correcting mistakes, there will be more people making mistakes, so that even though they are making mistakes, they don’t know they are wrong, and they don’t know the difference between right and wrong. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Everyone has flaws and no one is perfect. It’s okay to make mistakes; mistakes are part of growing up. Whether a child or a parent, a student or a teacher, an employee or a leader, a subordinate or a superior, if you make a mistake, just face it bravely and make corrections sincerely. Give firm support to those who correct mistakes and sincere encouragement to those who correct mistakes, so that mistakes can generate the power to nourish virtue. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(The author is a staff member of a public institution in Southwest China)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot; >;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;(The &quot;hi, Southern Weekly&quot; column of Southern Weekend App is looking forward to your contributions.

I actually don&#39;t like that kind of accident. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I&#39;m not that romantic either. There is a kind of person who really likes the solitude of sailing on the sea, such as the legendary French navigator Bernard. He was disgusted with cities and crowds. He loved freedom and sailing crazily and enjoyed solitude. I&#39;m not that kind of person, I&#39;m not that crazy. I am a &quot;fake lunatic&quot;, and I am not the artistic type. When I&#39;m at sea, I always miss my family and friends on the shore. I want to drink beer and have barbecue with them when we dock. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Whether I was a professional athlete on the national sailing team or am now engaged in extreme sailing competitions, I do not have a competitive mentality that insists on winning championships, advocating gold medals and winner takes all. Some people who compete in extreme sailing competitions participate in the competition just to win. Their competitive strategies are very aggressive. If they cannot win, they may choose to quit the competition. Neither am I. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/yST5LtCmWEI4dPPdC6KCdhDzm7YrmfK5wjv3OAfV.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/yST5LtCmWEI4dPPdC6KCdhDzm7YrmfK5wjv3OAfV.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253642&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On September 19, 2015, Duarnenez, the one-man transatlantic extreme sailing race, set sail.

But he seems to be doing something very irrational and crazy. He sailed around the China Sea and around the world, crossed the Atlantic Ocean in a 6.5-meter boat, and now bought a racing boat to participate in the world&#39;s most difficult extreme circumnavigation race. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;It can only mean that you really like this thing . As a rational person, you can devote so much to sailing. To you, this is really crazy to the extreme. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xu Jingkun: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Yes, that’s true. The life we ​​live now is a complete state of madness. After crossing the Atlantic in a single-person boat in 2015, it was actually considered top-notch in China. At that time, I was working as the vice president of a yacht club in Shenzhen, and my income and treatment were very good. Let’s put aside the good life, from 2017 to 2020, I completed a three-year circumnavigation with Ah Jiu. After that, we had a pretty good time in Hainan, and I had the goal of participating in the Vendée Globe. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Qingdao has many sailing talents, and they have already gone before you There are several legends, why can you go further and further, especially starting your own journey to the world&#39;s top professional rowing captain in 2022? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xu Jingkun: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I am a &quot;stupid person&quot;! On the one hand, I am very rational, and on the other hand, I don’t think too much about anything. When I think something is good and worth doing, I won’t think about doing this or not doing that, or not doing it. How about doing this and that...&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After I bought the IMOCA60 racing boat, I started to think about it, because I started to analyze rationally: I am a person from an ordinary peasant family, and every year Not making this money, but spending so much money...that&#39;s it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It costs 15,000 euros to lift the boat from the shore into the water, so there is no test drive. After paying the money, I got on the boat for the first time. It really felt unreal. It was completely different from all the boats I had sailed before. When that boat was flying on the sea, I saw why it was called the world&#39;s top racing boat. &quot;I finally stood on this boat, and this boat belongs to us!&quot; This feeling just rose in my heart, The next second I felt a lot of pressure. There are so many cable accessories on this super racing boat. It is really difficult to learn in a short time, and an operating error will cause huge losses. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I saw it was too complicated and thought it was impossible to solve it. After taking over, I never left the ship. I just parked it on the dock and studied it every day. After two months, I went to sea alone. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I am not a very smart person, and I am very forgetful. I can’t figure out what I thought and calculated when I bought the boat.算了咱不想了，明天再说，明天又忘了这些事了，你又不想了。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我喜欢机械的东西，对船可能有一点天赋吧。我们那个赛船特别复杂，欧洲很多船长都是有工程师学位的，同时还配有团队和教练，我就一个人去买的船。我初中都没有毕业，英语也是自学的，但是我不怵，花点儿时间我都能弄明白。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;大部分时间我和赛船一起的感受都是愉快的，只是它太贵了，维修保养的账单都很昂贵。每次付账单的时候我很心疼，但我的理性就告诉我，赶紧付了得了，然后又忘了这个不开心了哈哈。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/x2HEJrLwLBk7baJ6HnQgmSBo8lwDGmiNb3L1ZLHG.jpg&quot;

&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;徐京坤：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;的确是。在天海之间行船是非常美好的享受，去过那么多海面连接的地方，看到的体验到的，都会让人觉得美好。但我其实可能还更喜欢极限航行比赛这种具体的目标感，让我一直漂在海上，我也会不满足。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我是一个完美主义者，还有点英雄主义。我不是说要做一个人拯救地球的那种超级英雄，我想做自己的小小英雄。在极限航行中顶住压力，跨越大海，每次完成回来，我会觉得我是一个小小的英雄。 &lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;徐京坤：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;航海拓展了我的身体能力和意志，我的身体特别好，都是在极限要求中发展出来的。我能感觉到自己身体的强大适应性和康复能力，身体的极限在极限环境中被激发出来了。这也是我特别喜欢航海的原因，我能感觉自己是人类中的强者，对我来说，这令我内心更加强大。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;航海不是浪漫向往或者一味勇猛就行的，要完成极限挑战，还要把赛船平安地带回来，要上岸给等待的家人一个拥抱。出发前需要做很多具体艰苦的工作让赛船有一个完美的状态，任何问题都要考虑到，有两套甚至更多预备应急方案。航海让我养成了超强的执行力，“说到做到”，目标有多高，自己就付出更多的努力，这个也刻在我骨子里了。凡事认真，绝对不会说说就算了。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;经历过独自航行的孤独和风浪后，我更加喜欢日常生活，发自内心地爱自己的环境和朋友。就像现在这样平静安稳、没有风暴的日常，都让人珍惜，让人想要赞美美好的天气和美好的氛围。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方人物周刊：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;你有过非常孤单艰难的日子，青少年时代常有一种走投无路要掉到底层的恐惧和无望。 2012年独自启航开始环中国海的时候，抱着大不了一死的念头，心里很多愤懑。这么多年航行，你跟自己和命运都和解了吗？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;徐京坤：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;2012年那时候真的是带着一种跟命运赌气的感觉，心里有种壮士一去不复还的那种悲壮，甚至也带着一些怨念，说为什么我这个人一辈子要这么难，你们不相信我就拼死一搏，我要让这个事情去发生，对，带着这种劲。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;现在这些都被医治了，完成一个一个目标对我来讲很重要，你慢慢知道自己是可以掌握自己的命运的。小时候在农村，我又少了半条胳膊，周围真的是一个没有目标、生活漫无目的的环境。你不知道你的目标在哪，你也从来没有达成过一个目标，你会厌恶那个懦弱又不堪一击的自己，渴望充满斗志和勇气。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;通过航海，我有了一个又一个目标，这也是自我医治和成长的过程。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;从我用7个多月修好了一条要报废的小船，把它命名为“梦想号”，并且实现了环中国海这第一个目标后，我学会了相信自己、相信梦想。其实如果那一次失败，可能我这一辈子也不会再起来了，可能就彻底被打垮了，不光是被外界的东西打垮了，自己那道防线也没了。现在回头看，真的也觉得当时别人说我不切实际是可以理解的，自己可以说太幸运了，那个开始让我学会了相信，这种信念帮助我一步步走到现在。 &lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;大海它没有善意，也没有恶意，它无意伤害你，它就按照自然法则客观存在着。在海上人自然会平静下来，不会那么愤世嫉俗。我说实话，我觉得我更怕人。有时候专心忙航海的事情不看新闻，心很定，一关注社会新闻，感觉自己无所适从。西方社会制定的规则是针对东方的，东方又要针对西方做些制衡，对吧？好多事情都没有一个客观裁定的规则，混成一团，超级复杂。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/sHh7XjhhF6fTr6VquWLzIvx8bI30sFUYjc6vvFgX.jpg&quot;

&lt;p>;生活上也做一些调整。有一段时间我们都住在船上，方便工作，老外看我们也是很吃惊，早晨、晚上这俩中国人都在干活。前段时间刚租了一个房子，生活稍微正常一点。有一段时间，压力真的大到我看到那条船都已经厌恶了，失去乐趣了，我心里知道这肯定不行的。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;面对接下来旺代环球那种魔鬼航程，你如果没有真诚的热爱，没有真诚的信念，你的初心如果丢失的话，你是不可能坚持下来的。 &lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;比如你看我那么多好朋友和大哥，其实每次回来我经常会忽略了给他们带点东西或者是多一些关心回馈什么的。在这方面我是一个弱智，经常到了人家门口了才想起来今天什么也没有带，你又不是说不懂这种人情世故，你也一把年纪了你又懂，但是反应过来的时候总是晚了，生活中就总是不那么灵光。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方人物周刊：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;咖啡路你和英国传奇船长迈克·戈丁搭档，1200海里的资格航程，比去年朗姆路资格赛快了17个小时。迈克有过三次旺代参赛经验，十夺咖啡路亚军，你驾驭赛船也越来越娴熟，除了参赛完赛是否对名次还有更高预想？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;徐京坤：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;从我自己还有赛船的能力上，的确是可以冲击更快的速度的，我的船到现在还只释放了百分之七十的性能，没有往极限去狠跑。但是我们的策略还是安全完赛，拿到积分。说实话，我手上连大修一次的钱都没有，没有任性跑的资本。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这一点我跟迈克·戈丁船长也有过明确沟通，他非常理解，他也经历过这种资金有限的困难时期。策略非常明确，但执行到位不犯错仍然会是一个挑战，我天天告诫自己千万别激进，别贪快！一定要慢，一定要慎重！但是在海上很多时候都是瞬间决断，那一瞬间很难说自己认为正确的决定是真正明智的。希望我和搭档能够配合好，在具体情况中能够做好平衡。 &lt;/p>;

French Interior Minister Gérald Darmanin said in an exclusive interview with L&#39;Ouest-France that the authorities would respond as seriously as ever because &quot;the risk of terrorism remains high.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The fear of the &quot;11.13 Paris terrorist attacks&quot; many years ago came to mind.

Under cold eyes, two French policemen hugged each other and cried. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is understood that the article of the promotional material was disseminated through a variety of Internet platforms. The article also suggested that after a series of scripture-burning incidents, Sweden &quot;led the EU countries in combating Islam and Muslim countries.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula is a radical Islamist organization mainly active in Yemen and Saudi Arabia. After the terrorist attack on Charlie Hebdo in Paris in January 2015, the organization &quot;claimed responsibility.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;criminal record&quot; and naked provocation have aroused concern among the French authorities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“For a long time, we thought this would not happen again. However, Afghanistan, the Levant and Africa, etc. are funding it, which means the threat could happen.” 9, 2023 On March 20, French Interior Minister Darmanin warned in an interview that the risk of terrorist attacks in the country may resurface. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Darmanin pointed out that the current main danger still comes from radical elements in France. These individuals, often radicalized progressively on the Internet, are deeply isolated, receptive to jihadist propaganda and respond to calls for hate. They use very limited means to carry out their actions due to reasons such as religious radicalization, imitation or mental fragility. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, al-Qaeda and Islamic State affiliates have reestablished themselves in some areas. In the Sahel, especially in the Levant and Afghanistan, drug networks are being re-established and have the potential to finance terrorism. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“With money, these groups can train jihadists on the spot, for example by infiltrating migrant flows. Like some of the perpetrators of the November 13, 2015 attacks. They can also do it remotely. Train other people,” Darmanin said. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Burqa ban&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Tug-of-war&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;According to French BFMTV report on September 15, the terrorist organization called for &quot;letting Muslim children &quot;Being alone&quot; and &quot;growing up under the protection of parents&quot;. This text, coupled with the threat against &quot;a ministry in Paris,&quot; suggests that Al Qaeda was referring to the recent &quot;Abaya ban&quot; in France. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;It&#39;s hard not to link it to the recent ban on wearing abaya in French schools, although this was not mentioned at all,&quot; the report said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Abaya is a loose robe that covers the curves of a woman&#39;s body. In French schools, it is common to see female Muslim students wearing abaya to school. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the end of August 2023, the French government banned students from wearing such clothing with obvious religious symbols on the grounds of the principle of separation of church and state. According to instructions from the education department, when the school term begins in September, students wearing abaya will not be allowed to enter the classroom. After that, the school will &quot;explain the meaning of the ban&quot; to them. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;French President Macron emphasized on this issue that the government &quot;will never give in&quot; on this issue related to the principle of secularism. He said, &quot;We know that there will be violations... Some may just be out of negligence, but a lot of them want to challenge republican values. We must not compromise.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although the French government has banned the ban Despite the tough stance, some Muslim students still come to school wearing burqas. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to statistics from the French Ministry of Education, when school started on September 4, 298 students across the country were wearing burqas to school, and only 67 of them refused to take off their burqas. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On September 7, local time, a girl from Clermont-Ferrand High School in France was banned from entering the school because she insisted on wearing a burqa to school. Subsequently, the girl&#39;s father issued a &quot;throat-cutting&quot; death threat to the principal. After the principal called the police, the parent was detained by the police that night. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to student groups, there are also many Muslim supporters who oppose the &quot;burqa ban&quot; in various ways. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the French government issued a ban, three institutions, including the Paris-South Education Association, appealed. They asked for the ban to be suspended, saying that the ban violated &quot;fundamental freedoms.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On September 19, 2023, more than a dozen Muslim women gathered outside the French Embassy in Austria to express solidarity with French Muslim women over the abaya ban. In a video of the protest that circulated online, a woman wearing an orange robe and headscarf could be seen holding up a protest sign that read &quot;Abaya, our identity, our rights.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“France’s Muslim policy is actually part of its basic requirements for citizens of all ethnic groups.” Niu Song, a researcher at the Institute of Middle East Studies at Shanghai International Studies University, told Southern Weekend reporters that as far as religious clothing is concerned, it involves It’s not just the headscarf issue, clothing or symbols related to other religions, including Christianity, are also restricted. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;In other words, France&#39;s restrictions on religious clothing and symbols in the public sphere are not targeted at a specific religion, but the struggles of religious believers have always been accompanied by the policy implementation process. Even within French society, There are also different views on the understanding and implementation of the principles of republican assimilation and separation of church and state. In short, the fierce confrontations over headscarves and abaya clothing have not only torn French society apart, but are bound to anger conservative Muslim groups,&quot; Neuzon said. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After many days of debate, the French Supreme Court ruled on September 25 that the government’s ban on Muslim robes is “legal”. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Why &lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;always &lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;France? &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;From 2015 to 2016, the Bataclan concert hall shooting in France and the Charlie Hebdo attack occurred one after another, and violent terrorist attacks intensified. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the &quot;Nice Coast Terrorist Attack&quot; that killed at least 84 people on July 14, 2016, the British security think tank &quot;Centre for Geopolitics and Security Realism&quot; (CGSRS) published a report titled The report &quot;Why It&#39;s Always France&quot; attempts to analyze the internal logic behind the high incidence of terrorist attacks in France. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;While other European countries have also experienced terrorism, &quot;France is showing a clear pattern&quot; and is &quot;particularly affected,&quot; the report said. At the same time, although the attackers claimed &quot;loyalty to extremist organizations,&quot; most of them were young French citizens and acted in small groups. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Why is France such a prominent target of homegrown Islamic terrorism? The report offers several explanations for this. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The first is foreign policy. The report said France has a long history of meddling in the Muslim world, particularly in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. Islamists therefore often regard France as a &quot;legitimate target&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Secondly, the composition of France’s population increases the possibility of Islamic terrorist attacks. For example, 7%-9% of the population is Muslim, which is much higher than other large European countries such as Germany or the United Kingdom. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, immigrants from the Middle East and North Africa lack mobility opportunities and have lived in poverty for a long time, which has brought &quot;distrust and hatred&quot; towards French native people and institutions. Finally, France has a long tradition of secularism, and many citizens have a very negative view of any form of religion. This has left some Muslim groups feeling that their religious freedom is under attack. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many Chinese international relations scholars also explained to Southern Weekend reporters why France is &quot;targeted&quot; by extremist organizations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Nutson believes that within the Western camp, France has a relatively &quot;strict&quot; attitude towards diverse ethnic groups and faith groups, emphasizing ethnic equality and defending the principle of secularization, and does not allow religious elements to be excessively displayed in the public sphere. Therefore, contradictions and conflicts surrounding the issue of headscarves and abaya clothing will appear periodically. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, there are structural contradictions between immigrants, refugees and European society, which include not only significant gaps in economic strength, but also differences in civilizational backgrounds. Countries such as Germany and Italy have relatively mild attitudes and policies towards Muslim immigrants, while France, due to its strict secularization policy, is more likely to intensify already accumulated conflicts on issues such as religious clothing, and it is difficult to maneuver around the issue due to its religious nature. room. France has naturally become the &quot;priority&quot; option for terrorist organizations to carry out attacks in Europe. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Yiwei, director of the Institute of International Affairs at Renmin University of China, told Southern Weekend reporters that France is the birthplace of modern European civilization. The concepts of liberty, equality, and fraternity of the French Revolution influenced the entire Europe. However, the proliferation of freedom also brings offense to other civilizations, which will cause dissatisfaction among conservatives. At the same time, France has a large Muslim population, and actions against the external Muslim world will also cause internal backlash. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As predicted in the &quot;Why Always France&quot; report, &quot;France may face more terrorist attacks in the future due to the complexity and depth of the problem.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;“&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;This&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;is not new&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Except for the law Abroad, Sweden was also targeted in this &quot;terrorist attack notice&quot;. This is related to the controversy over the burning of scriptures by radicals in Sweden for several months. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since June 2023, incidents of burning and desecrating Islamic religious texts have occurred in many places in Sweden. The main participants are Iraqi refugees Salwan Momika and Salwan Najim. (Salwan Najem). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The two have publicly opposed the Islamic religious classic &quot;Quran&quot; on many occasions and held demonstrations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, before this &quot;terrorist attack notice&quot;, Sweden had been &quot;named&quot; and intimidated by other extremist organizations due to the &quot;Scripture Burning&quot; incident. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In August 2023, the Al Qaeda media platform &quot;As-Sahab Media Foundation&quot; (The As-Sahab Media Foundation) called in an announcement titled &quot;The Obligation to Attack Aggressive Nations&quot; to Denmark and Sweden have retaliated against the burnings of scriptures that have occurred over the past few months. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On August 13, the British Foreign Office issued a travel warning, stating that an attack was likely to occur in Sweden, and that its security authorities had foiled many attack attempts. The Chinese Embassy in Sweden also reminded that Chinese citizens should pay attention to changes in the current security situation in Sweden, increase security awareness, maintain a high degree of vigilance, and strengthen security precautions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On August 17, Sweden raised the country&#39;s terrorism threat level from Level 3 to Level 4 &quot;high threat status&quot; for the first time since 2016. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Swedish authorities stated that this decision was based on a &quot;comprehensive, long-term and strategic judgment&quot; based on the deteriorating security situation in Sweden. Since then, many Swedish departments have strengthened security measures in borders, airports, public transportation and other fields. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Regarding the &quot;terrorist threats&quot; encountered by Sweden, Hans Brun, a Swedish terrorism researcher at King&#39;s College in the United Kingdom, believes that these threats are &quot;not new&quot; and not that important. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He told Sweden&#39;s TT news agency, &quot;You can think of it as a call to action for individuals. If they had organized it themselves, they would not have announced it in advance like this. You should also remember that Al Qaeda is now greatly weakened.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Brun said that Al Qaeda&#39;s statement will not affect the overall security situation. The biggest impact may be on Danish and Swedish diplomats working in the Middle East, who may need Take extra precautions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Brunn’s “prophecy” is not groundless. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In July 2023, after radicals burned scriptures outside a mosque in the Swedish capital Stockholm, Iraqi protesters stormed the Swedish Embassy in Iraq, expelled the ambassador and burned the embassy. Iraqi Prime Minister Sudani even expelled the Swedish ambassador and suspended the work permit of Swedish telecommunications company Ericsson. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As of now, the Swedish government is seeking legal means to limit the intensification of scripture burning incidents in recent days in order to ease tensions with Islamic countries. However, supporters have argued that this could violate the country&#39;s constitution. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Will they take action?&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;As of September 8, 2023 Since the start of the Rugby World Cup, France has been hosting large-scale events, including the visit of King Charles III and the visit of the Pope, and these events will continue until the 2024 Paris Olympics. As French Interior Minister Darmanin lamented in an interview, &quot;The risk of terrorism is very high, and major incidents are coming one after another.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Darmanin said that in order to provide security for the Olympics, France has added 14,000 police and gendarmerie and is cooperating with multiple departments to deal with different risks. &quot;We&#39;ve been working on this for two years,&quot; Darmanin said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;With the announcement of terrorist attack warnings, many people are worried about whether extremist organizations will take action. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Alain Rodier, deputy director of the French Intelligence Research Center, said in an interview with BFMTV that Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula took action two years after threatening &quot;Charlie Hebdo&quot;. &quot;This shows that Al Qaeda has the ability to wait.&quot; &quot;When they make threats, they often take action.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On September 28, Southern Weekend reporters contacted Alan Rodier via email, and he revealed many details about the organization. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Alain Rodier said that in 2013, Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula announced 11 &quot;wanted persons&quot; through the online publication &quot;Inspire&quot;, including &quot;Charlie Hebdo&quot; cartoonist Stefan Stéphan Charbonnier. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Two years later, two self-proclaimed terrorists from Al Qaeda, brothers Cherif Kouachi and Saïd Kouachi, attacked Charlie Hebdo, resulting in At least 12 people, including the editor-in-chief of the weekly, were killed and many others were injured. One of the perpetrators, Said, received military-style training in Yemen in 2011. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Alain Rodier believes that since the 2015 attacks, the jihadist movement launched by extremist organizations no longer seems to target Western countries directly, but &quot;recruits through advertisements.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“These organizations do not appear to have sufficient means to send activists to Europe to carry out terrorist acts. We must ensure that their speeches are not exploited by endogenous terrorists,” Alain-Rodier said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Niu Song, from the Institute of Middle East Studies at Shanghai International Studies University, believes that under the global coordinated anti-terrorism offensive, Al Qaeda&#39;s influence is not as strong as before, but it still has the motivation and ability to carry out violent terrorist attacks. Therefore, Al Qaeda’s threat to launch attacks on France and Sweden should not be taken lightly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Nutson said that in fact, the international community, including France and Switzerland, has always been highly concerned about and should be vigilant about the current trends and capabilities of al-Qaeda, and will not remain indifferent to its verbal threats. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are also people who are skeptical about this terrorist attack warning. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wasim Nasr, a senior researcher at the Soufan Center in France, called on the public to remain rational in an interview with the French &quot;Le Point&quot; magazine. &quot;There is no moment of panic yet. arrival&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He believes that the magazine has a total of 17 pages, focusing on Yemen, and the threats to Sweden and France only appear on page 14. &quot;The threat is certainly there and we must take it seriously, but there is currently no reason to be more alarmed,&quot; Nasr said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(Southern Weekend intern Li Jinao also contributed to this article)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 16 Oct 2023 14:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[巴赫：国际奥委会正考虑创办奥林匹克电子竞技运动会]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258672]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-16 14:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Whether e-sports can be included in the Olympics, there may be a new answer soon. International Olympic Committee President Bach revealed here on the evening of the 14th that the International Olympic Committee is considering creating an Olympic Games that belongs to e-sports. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Bach made the above remarks while delivering a speech at the opening ceremony of the 141st Plenary Session of the International Olympic Committee held that night. He said: &quot;I have asked the new International Olympic Committee e-sports committee to study the creation of Olympic e-sports games.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;a>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms /medias/image/23/10/15/c802d6c41ee832ef334118874cf8eb40.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1000&quot; height=&quot;564&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com /cms/medias/image/23/10/15/c802d6c41ee832ef334118874cf8eb40.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;254123&quot;>;&lt;/a>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to statistics, about 3 billion people around the world play video games. More than 500 million people are particularly interested in e-sports, including virtual sports and simulated sports, and most of them are young people under the age of 34. Bach said that the International Olympic Committee attaches great importance to this, so since 2018, the International Olympic Committee has been involved in the development of e-sports projects in an all-round way. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We have chosen a way that allows us to be active in esports while remaining true to the values ​​that we have lived by for more than a century. In esports, the values ​​have always been A red line we will not cross. Our clear stance has earned us growing respect from the esports community. A leading publisher redesigned one of their popular games to align with Olympic values ​​– so players Just shoot the target, not the person.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2021, the International Olympic Committee will host the Olympic Virtual Series. This is the International Olympic Committee’s first pilot project in the field of e-sports. Based on the successful experience of the Olympic Virtual Series, the International Olympic Committee held the first Olympic Esports Week this year, and the results were very popular - including the qualifiers, the esports series attracted more than 500,000 participants, and the competition Over 6 million live views across all channels. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Bach said: &quot;It&#39;s a promising start, but it&#39;s just the beginning. As in any sport, even after a promising start, the real game is still ahead. &quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Bach also talked about artificial intelligence in his speech that night, saying: &quot;Our continued success depends on how we embrace the accelerating development of digital technologies, especially artificial intelligence. This makes our &quot; &quot;Olympic Agenda 2020&quot; is even more urgent - &#39;Either change or be changed&#39;.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Bach emphasized that the International Olympic Committee must take the initiative, &quot;We must conduct a comprehensive analysis of the opportunities and risks of artificial intelligence , and then take action immediately. I&#39;m happy to tell you that this work is already underway. If things go well, you may see some preliminary results in Paris (Olympic Games).&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The 141st Plenary Session of the International Olympic Committee will last until the 17th. The main agenda of this plenary session includes voting on amendments to the Olympic Charter and the project setting of the 2028 Los Angeles Olympic Games, and the election of several new International Olympic Committee members. In addition, the plenary session will evaluate the mid-term implementation of the Olympic 2020+5 Agenda and hear the plans for the 2024 Paris Olympics, the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics, the 2032 Brisbane Olympics, and the 2026 Milan-Cortina d’Ampezzo Winter Games.

The employees of the maintenance shop in the service area threatened to stop the maintenance technicians hired from outside to repair the car. Is this &quot;reasonable and legal&quot;? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to Jimu News, a truck transporting fruit broke down and failed to start while resting in the Jiangxi Fengcheng service area of ​​the Shanghai-Kunming Expressway. After the auto repair shop in the service area said it could not repair the vehicle, the driver himself invited a technician from a nearby designated repair shop of the truck manufacturer to come to the service area to prepare for repairs. Unexpectedly, he was blocked and intimidated by the staff of the repair shop in the service area. The maintenance technician who was invited had no choice but to leave. The truck driver contacted several local repair shops, but they did not dare to arrange for personnel to go to the service area to repair the vehicle. There was no choice but for the driver to drag the car off the highway to repair it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is not uncommon for car repairs to conflict with repair shops in expressway service areas. More than a month ago, a similar incident occurred in the Jiqing service area in Hunan. A truck driver was stopped by repairmen in the service area when he was inspecting his truck. After being told that the driver made the repairs himself, he uttered wild words. On social networks, similar complaints involving car repairs and tow truck conflicts on the highway are not the same. Some service area repair shop staff even use violence or threaten violence against drivers who repair their own cars. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the highway, can only repair shops in the service area repair cars? In an interview with the media, the person in charge of the Fengcheng service area said that the practices of the repair shop in the service area are &quot;reasonable and legal and have laws to follow.&quot; The law the person in charge refers to refers to the provisions of the Highway Law, Highway Safety Protection Regulations and other relevant regulations that &quot;prohibit the establishment of stalls within the scope of highways and highway land.&quot; This is obviously a misinterpretation. The so-called &quot;setting up stalls&quot; refers to setting up relatively fixed stalls for a long time and waiting for customers to come to your door. The purpose of prohibiting it is to avoid &quot;damaging, polluting the highway and affecting the smooth flow of the highway.&quot; After receiving the invitation from the customer, he temporarily went on the road to repair the car, precisely to repair the vehicle as soon as possible to avoid parking on the road for a long time and to ensure the smooth flow of the road. Regardless of the definition of &quot;setting up a stall&quot; or the legislative purpose of the regulations, it is completely legal for drivers to repair their cars by themselves or to invite repairmen to temporarily repair their cars on the road. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the conflict at the Jiqing service area in Hunan mentioned above, the repairmen in the service area claimed that the Provincial Department of Transportation had a document that stipulated that &quot;people below&quot; (referring to repair shops other than the expressway) cannot go to the expressway for repairs. car, but ultimately failed to produce relevant documents. Do the traffic management departments in some places really have such regulations? If such a document does exist, it should be made public and reviewed for legality. If the government department does not have such regulations, is this an internal regulation of the highway management department, or is the service area repair shop lying? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In vehicle maintenance services, drivers and car owners are consumers, and of course they have the right to freely choose repair service providers. Auto repair shops in service areas prevent drivers from repairing their cars by themselves or other repairmen, and force drivers to go to their repair shops to repair their cars. This is a &quot;forced transaction&quot; behavior that is expressly prohibited by the Consumer Rights Protection Act. The Criminal Law also stipulates that using violence or threats to forcefully buy or sell goods, force others to provide services or force others to receive services, if the circumstances are serious, constitutes the crime of forced transaction. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Why are obviously illegal behaviors so common? The root of the problem lies in the word &quot;profit&quot;. As the person in charge of the Fengcheng service area said, off-road vehicle maintenance personnel going to the service area to repair cars &quot;harms the interests of the service area repair shops.&quot; The interests of service area repair shops are actually the interests of service area and highway managers. Expressway service areas, as part of expressway service facilities, are constructed and operated by expressway managers. If a repair shop opens in a service area, it must pay space rent to the highway administrator. These rents are generally higher than those for sites outside highways, because this is not only site rent, but also implies a premium for &quot;exclusive operating rights.&quot; Precisely because highway managers also benefit from the &quot;exclusive operating rights&quot; of repair shops, they will naturally try their best to protect the interests of repair shops. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This &quot;exclusivity&quot; premium is very common in closed establishments. Food prices in airport terminals and highway service areas are generally much more expensive than in urban areas. Even canteens in primary and secondary schools can be auctioned for sky-high prices. This is all due to the monopoly benefits brought by the &quot;exclusive operating rights.&quot; More importantly, these premium benefits are not obtained through market competition, but rely on franchise rights granted by administrative power. For these infrastructure operators with administrative monopolies, the common practice in various countries is to strictly limit their profit margins to maintain a balance between attracting social investment and avoiding huge profits to maintain public welfare. To this end, they must be strictly supervised to prevent them from relying on their monopoly status to harm the public interest. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A few years ago, there was an incident in a highway service area in Guangdong where a driver repaired his own car and was threatened by a repair shop employee. Due to public opinion and the intervention of relevant departments, the auto repair shop in the service area was shut down for rectification. The same incident occurred in Fengcheng, Jiangxi this time. The public expects local market supervision and other departments to take timely action to investigate and deal with forced buying and selling, and forced transactions to safeguard the interests of consumers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 16 Oct 2023 12:25:03 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
