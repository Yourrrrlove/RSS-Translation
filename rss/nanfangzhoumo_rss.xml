But my grandma also passed away not long after. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/11/b079fe836d8c04e3c58ab8866954c5b2.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;608&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/11/b079fe836d8c04e3c58ab8866954c5b2.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;257961&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Left from mother From the day he wrote the note and left, Numakura Koichi secretly made up his mind to seek revenge from the underworld leader one day. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to realize his revenge plan, he picked up the comic book &quot;Fist of the North Star&quot; at home and studied and practiced diligently, just because the protagonist in the comic knew a unique skill of tapping acupuncture points to cause death. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Numakura Takashi studied this skill day and night, and finally succeeded ten years later. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/11/534d93e3a2ec461d120d409d1ebfb37a.gif&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;591&quot; height= &quot;313&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/11/534d93e3a2ec461d120d409d1ebfb37a.gif&quot; data-key=&quot;257969&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He found the underworld The boss, just hit him with acupuncture points. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As a result, the leader not only escaped unharmed, but also asked the younger brother next to him to beat him half to death, while beating him and cursing &quot;Where did you come from?&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/11/eea3597e823ed4b614c62fbea496c506.gif&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height= &quot;353&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/11/eea3597e823ed4b614c62fbea496c506.gif&quot; data-key=&quot;257970&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src =&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/11/1421919e0da17db59191276939089fa4.gif&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;353&quot; data-src=&quot;// images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/11/1421919e0da17db59191276939089fa4.gif&quot; data-key=&quot;257963&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Numakura Koichi suddenly realized: It turns out that comics do not depict the human body He made an accurate description of the acupuncture points, which led to him not completing his revenge plan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So, he determined to delve into more professional acupoint knowledge, and at the same time learned from others&#39; strengths, integrating Chinese acupuncture points, Thai massage, finger techniques, etc., and finally became a nationally awarded qualification certificate through hard study. masseur. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Killing for revenge and growing up to be a professional masseur is the first layer of reversal in &quot;The Storm&quot; and also the tone of its storytelling. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although it has the chubby and passionate style of a Japanese drama, and talks serious nonsense, it can make you want to watch it. As the audience said, &quot;This plot is like a wild horse running wild, unable to find the direction to go in the next second.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/ cms/medias/image/23/11/11/dc978e304182538322770b4844d86e7c.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;644&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/ 23/11/11/dc978e304182538322770b4844d86e7c.png&quot; data-key=&quot;257962&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, after finally getting an opportunity for the underworld leader to ask for a massage, Numakura Koichi was about to execute the acupuncture revenge plan, but unexpectedly It was discovered that the other party had a spinal tumor, and it was still in an advanced stage. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to common sense, you should be happy to learn that your enemy is about to die. But Numakura Koichi was in great pain, because in the revenge plan he had planned as a child, the leader could only be considered complete if he died in his hands. Any other way of death could not eliminate Numakura Koichi&#39;s heart. hate. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this way, the planned revenge plan turned into a rescue plan in an instant. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/11/bd85aa9868d5d13eff856364568d854f.gif&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height= &quot;357&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/11/bd85aa9868d5d13eff856364568d854f.gif&quot; data-key=&quot;257971&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Looking at it The leader&#39;s spinal tumor was about to be cured and he could immediately carry out his revenge plan. However, the leader was suddenly hit by a car accident and was knocked face down to the ground, sliding for several meters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As a last resort, Numakura Koichi took action again and pulled him back from the gate of hell. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;No one was killed, no revenge was taken, but his life was saved several times. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/11/f27646daa8eb00976e979c113228e36b.gif&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;591&quot; height= &quot;329&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/11/f27646daa8eb00976e979c113228e36b.gif&quot; data-key=&quot;257972&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This kind of reliance Delays and contrasts, as well as the narrative method of constantly dissolving the plot of revenge, are the basic operations of &quot;The Storm in the World&quot; to stimulate the audience to laugh. To put it bluntly, it relies on the occurrence of a series of unexpected events to disintegrate the serious proposition of revenge. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among all film and television genres, comedy is the most deconstructive genre. It liberates us from a certain serious state and also liberates the protagonist from the weight of meaning. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Just like Koichi Numakura in &quot;The Legend of the Underworld&quot;, he is full of revenge plans, but what he actually does is to save the life of the underworld leader. Before Koichi Numakura even realizes how ridiculous his behavior is, we as the audience have already realized the ridiculousness of him betting his life on revenge. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/11/7ad631b60f27814fcb3c4adb8aa08e54.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;721&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/11/7ad631b60f27814fcb3c4adb8aa08e54.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;257964&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Comedy is not here To construct meaning and to paint it, we need to dig out the walls of meaning and make it appear somewhat powerless when it collapses. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This dissolution of meaning is comprehensive, and the objects it wants to mock include even us as the audience. It just sets a safe distance for us, allowing us to get a kind of psychological comfort from ridiculing the protagonist. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After seeing that Numakura Koichi started to practice &quot;Fist of the North Star&quot; diligently at the age of ten, and ten years later, he performed acupuncture on the underworld leader under a streetlight, and was beaten until his face was covered with blood. , the pain of being scolded as crazy also coincides with our feelings of working hard but not getting anything in return. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/11/d660e6b365ee5cd4d9b0329432df8966.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;608&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/11/d660e6b365ee5cd4d9b0329432df8966.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;257966&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Comedy, use A sudden escape method brings the audience into some common experience or experience, and thus resonates with it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;The Storm in the Cave Realm&quot; obviously understands this well, so most of its plot settings are deduced on this basis. For example, the acquaintance between the heroine Rika Sakamoto (played by Nishino Nanase) and Koichi Numakura is full of a sense of escape. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sakamoto Rika was originally a young woman who was interested in a massage career. However, due to her father&#39;s high paraplegia in a car accident, she had to work several jobs to support her family. She works in a custom shop at night, and Numakura Koichi met her when he went to the custom shop. She showed her massage skills to Numakura Koichi, but Numakura Koichi had a very bad experience. In turn, he gave Sakamoto Rika a massage, hoping to show her what a real master is. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/11/d905a0f491c7c617ebb8567812affaeb.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;608&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/11/d905a0f491c7c617ebb8567812affaeb.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;257965&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The result is, Sakamoto Rika kowtowed and became a disciple on the spot. But at this moment the alarm clock rang. Sakamoto Rika held the alarm clock seriously and asked the newly appointed teacher Numakura Koichi if he wanted to add another clock. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/11/ca53ed503071fc99c7904e30254fca19.gif&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height= &quot;357&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/11/ca53ed503071fc99c7904e30254fca19.gif&quot; data-key=&quot;257968&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Acupoint World&quot; The brilliance of &quot;Wind and Cloud&quot; as a comedy lies in this. It removes the fig leaf and allows you to discover the absurdity behind serious things and the emptiness behind persistence. And all the hard work and dedication sometimes seem like a ridiculous daydream. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This ubiquitous comedy makes Numakura Koichi&#39;s determination for revenge turn into a joke in the face of his actual actions to save the underworld leader again and again. The more serious Numakura Koichi looks and the more he swears, the more he looks like a clown. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/11/180acc554311c286ce8487972fb043ed.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;608&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/11/180acc554311c286ce8487972fb043ed.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;257967&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is a drama It is a collection of ridicule on the great contrast between Numakura Koichi&#39;s spirit and behavior. It is also a sigh about being too persistent and getting into trouble. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is why, when he thought of the underworld leader lying dying in bed due to a car accident, Numakura Koichi suddenly felt that he had lost the motivation to live. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He gambled his youth and life, letting hatred and anger fill his mind, but what he got in exchange was that he saved his enemies again and again. This joke that fate and character played on him was a bit too absurd. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 12 Nov 2023 20:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[费滢：巴黎黑户、旧货商人与10年博士生]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260360]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-12 19:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 11/08/lYKOEf6757VvmHrJPllfLZTZ2olhGCkPT9umLjv8.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/lYKOEf6757VvmHrJPllfLZTZ2olhGC kPT9umLjv8. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;257451&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern People Weekly reporter Liang Chen/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Literature Defended&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;On October 24, 2023, the 6th Blancpain Utopia Literature Award Ceremony was held in Beijing. Fei Yinghe The other four nominees sat in the audience. She was shortlisted for her novel collection &quot;The Legend of Dzi Beads&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among the finalists, her identity is relatively complicated. She has published three books, the first is &quot;The Girl Who Often Gets Wandered&quot; written in middle school, the second is &quot;Dong Ke Lou Jing Bian&quot; which was published nearly 20 years ago in 2020, and the third is in 2023 The novella &quot;Legend of Dzi Beads&quot; was published in 2011. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If you search for her name, you can also see information about her failure in the college entrance examination more than ten years ago. She won the gold medal in the &quot;Global Chinese Youth Essay Writing Contest&quot; and her article was included in high school Chinese textbooks. But she left Nanjing, where she grew up, with everyone&#39;s speculation that her college entrance examination essay would score 25 points, and went to France to study. She earned a Ph.D. while running her own small antique business (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: italics, italics_ GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;The &quot;occupation&quot; written on the French visa is &quot;second-hand goods dealer&quot;&lt;/span>;). She travels around exhibitions in various places, always carrying a magnifying glass (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;often lost&lt;/span>;), a purple light and cash (&lt;span style=&quot;font- family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Putting it aside when setting up a stall can attract wealth - a kind of metaphysics in the antique circle&lt;/span>;) three-piece set. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Her doctoral major is &quot;Buddhist Philology&quot; and she has not graduated after 10 years of study. She is called a &quot;missing person&quot; by her tutor. Due to various mistakes in administrative procedures, he was forced to become a gangster for nearly four years. During this period, she wandered around Chinatown in the 13th arrondissement of Paris, reading and picking up leaks... Based on the principle of eating more than one fish, or &quot;striving for the maximum reward for labor&quot; - just like her &quot;The Classics of the East Classroom&quot;, won She received a bonus once for the award, a royalties for reprinting it in journals, and it was published once in traditional Chinese and simplified Chinese. She wrote a novel (by the way) based on everything she saw and heard, which is mainly reflected in the third chapter &quot;The Legend of Dzi Beads&quot;. The first &quot;Xing Zehuan&quot; takes place in her hometown of Lixiahe River Basin, and the content is pretty much the same. It&#39;s always about a small antique dealer with little money in his account, showing off his arms. The middle piece is called &quot;Reverse Scene&quot;, which combines drama, supernatural, suspense and science fiction - a very cyberware mashup. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/7iuJKfhv5ryqGZAEj3FSP0Iuq48pMiJ8v0yN5hoT.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;673&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/7iuJKfhv5ryqGZAEj3FSP0Iuq48pMiJ8v0yN5hoT.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;257456&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Rich life experience , writing books became a less visible part of it, although it was the part that brought her wider fame. Her novel &quot;Bird&quot; won the United Press Literary Award Short Story Grand Prize, and &quot;Eastern Classroom Classic&quot; won the first prize of the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Literary Award. She didn&#39;t even spend much time writing. &quot;Bird&quot; only took one or two hours to write, and the three novellas in &quot;Legend of Dzi Beads&quot; were all completed within half a year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Writer Tang Nuo said: &quot;I have met many excellent novelists and some talented novelists. Fei Ying is one of the best ones I have seen. I shouldn’t have met more than three people... She has relatively few works, which is her trouble. I’m not sure if the novel world can get this person. She may have something she finds more interesting and interesting to do. Do it.&quot; Just like at the Utopia Literary Award Ceremony, no one paid more attention to the sponsor&#39;s products and speeches than she did. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As a second-hand dealer, Blancpain&#39;s watch may become her single product. She has done some research on antique watches and knows the two impacts that quartz watches and electronic watches have brought to mechanical watches. While listening to the speech, scattered memories flashed through my mind: French women always like to buy a small lip watch to match their fashions, the soaring price of Italian Vetta, and the fact that Le Jour is a Swiss brand with a French label. She specializes in antiques business, and the knowledge she occasionally learns about clocks and watches is just used for talking with clients, &quot;to look a bit stylish.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the stage, the spokesperson of the sponsor gave his own definition of &quot;defending complexity&quot;: a simple and bright surface, but a very complicated movement; and a watch with 800 parts is difficult to operate. Very simple. Fei Ying suddenly understood the meaning: &quot;Perhaps what mechanical watches and literature do are consistent to some extent, they are both efforts to make time visible.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She recalled some auctions or private exchanges Meeting, suspension, exaggeration, strong commercial flavor, but with a special thoughtfulness, which is the product of the mature stage of capitalist development, making people feel a little sincerity of a convention. Like Eliot in Somerset Maugham&#39;s &quot;Blade&quot;, he is keen on hosting parties and even takes care of arranging seats. While being sarcastic, he also sincerely and tolerantly supports everyone&#39;s conversation (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Italics , italics_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Even vulgar American taste&lt;/span>;). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“This feeling is so complicated that I even think that those of us who are engaged in literature have inherent (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>; or intentionally The aloof ignorance and ignorant aloofness displayed&lt;/span>; were also gently lifted up. No, they were protected. After all, in comparison, we are the unprofessional group.&quot; She said in wrote afterwards. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fei Yingwen is like a person, with a generous expression, eight teeth exposed when speaking, and eyes narrowed to a slit. She laughed brightly, her clothes were loose and loose, and her sleeves dangled when she walked. When she spoke, she often played with her green peaked cap, on which a duck was raising its head and saying &quot;yeah&quot; with its wings. The antiques, anecdotes, legends, and secrets of the underworld come one after another in her mouth, and they are clearly organized. If she didn&#39;t do this business, she could probably still be a storyteller. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She said that she is a &quot;social cow whose business personality has been transformed.&quot; She was laughing and joking as if nothing in the world could trouble her - except taking pictures. Fei Ying&#39;s expression in front of the camera lost its joyful expression, her condensed expression scattered all over the floor, and her lively face suddenly became stiff. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The publisher said that &quot;Legend of Dzi Beads&quot;, especially the chapter &quot;Chinatown&quot;, seems to be &quot;world literature written by Chinese people&quot;, and it is up to the readers to judge whether it is accurate or not. Anyway, Fei Ying is dancing with joy She was very &quot;worldly&quot; at that time - she was cynical, but she took the injustices she saw seriously - by analogy with the book reviews she wrote, such a straightforward definition may be a bit offensive, and it also seems not very advanced. If you have read her Douban, you can somewhat feel the literary concept hidden in her dense complaints broadcast: presentation, statement, and ending. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;By the way, until now, she has not graduated with a Ph.D. From this, we can expect that this actively or passively extended academic career will lead to more possibilities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/sjPrjtBofroQcW5jkI4XrPNVwchuHiunjfInemM6.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/sjPrjtBofroQcW5jkI4XrPNVwchuHiunjfInemM6.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;257449&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Fei Ying participated in the domestic antiques &quot;Bed Rendezvous&quot;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(provided by the interviewee/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt; h4>;Old school&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In September 2013, Fei Ying went on a trip with her mother. At the end of the trip, her mother gave her the remaining 2,000 euros in cash and said earnestly: &quot;You are getting older and want to be independent. There is not much money left in your account. You can take the 2,000 euros.&quot;&lt; /p>; &lt;p>;Back in Paris, the 2,000 euros were quickly replaced by one month’s rent (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;700 euros&lt;/span>;) and a year’s subway ride. Ticket (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;700 euros&lt;/span>;), tuition fee for one semester (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti; ;&quot;>;400 euros&lt;/span>;) was dismembered, leaving just over a hundred euros. She was struggling to make a living, and she happened to see Faye Wong and Guo Degang wearing Tang Baleng in news photos. At that time, one piece sold for 10,000 yuan on the market. She knew the origin of this bead: it was a kind of agate bead produced between the Han Dynasty and the Tang Dynasty. It was basically imported from Central Asia and was available all over the world. It was large in quantity, similar in appearance, and had limited specificity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She thought of Wang Zengqi&#39;s &quot;Running Alarm&quot;: If someone brings gold, someone will throw away the gold. If someone throws gold, someone will pick up the gold. I am a human, so I can pick up the gold. &quot;I&#39;m a human being, why can&#39;t I pick it up?&quot; She downloaded relevant information on jstor (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Academic website&lt;/span>;), borrowed books, and researched The circulation of ancient beads. &quot;I collected all the research materials in this area as if I were writing a doctoral thesis outline.&quot; Fei Ying said, &quot;With some of the original knowledge, it is easier to identify roughly the age and scope, and the purpose of the research. See where it is most likely to be found in the market.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A month later, she began to collect scattered Tang Baleng in a larger area. She went to French antique markets and some trade fairs, and flipped through a thousand pages on eBay (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;online auction and shopping website&lt;/span>;), and finally I found a 16-piece Tang Baleng bracelet for $100. It was during Thanksgiving, and the seller had no idea, &quot;It&#39;s only $100. I&#39;m not an artist. I can&#39;t use your iPhone to take clear photos for you.&quot; She had to beg the seller to take a picture of a bead under the light. After taking a close-up photo to confirm the authenticity, I spent US$100 on shipping to get this string of beads across the ocean, and then resold them to a domestic merchant for 5,000 yuan a piece, and I got 80,000. Since then, he has entered the industry and officially became an antique dealer. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She concluded that her small antique business mostly provides a service to help customers find what they want. For most collectors, antiques are a kind of consumer product that shows their taste in life. They basically follow the trend in type selection and look for whatever is popular on the market. In recent years, in addition to jade of various ages, she has also helped people find white tea that is more than 30 years old and Moutai liquor that has aged well. &quot;Is Maotai considered an antique?&quot; &quot;Even Cordyceps Sinensis counts.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;These are all unexpected needs. There are still many things to do, including helping them arrange dishes and banquets. For example Talk about interesting games, what kind of things I will show in this game, I will help you arrange it.&quot; Fei Ying said, &quot;Generally, some enjoyable, exquisite, artistic, and luxurious things can be planned in advance.&quot;&lt; /p>; &lt;p>;&quot;(Antique dealer) is a very nostalgic profession. Of course there are many pitfalls and deceptions, but there are also moral principles and rules. Speech at the checkout is essential. Exchange knowledge with them and guide their taste. Sometimes, there is the exaggeration and persuasion part. A customer trusts you, and he puts all his investments in this area to you, asking you to help him find the items he likes. You have to keep it true and can return the goods. But you are them Are you a friend? You are just a businessman. They will also invite you to attend some occasions as a cultural bargaining chip. You charge a fee, but you are their old friend. It is very interesting. This is a kind of tradition that has existed since ancient times. , old-school social relationships.&quot; Fei Ying said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Old-school communication requires not only the professional ability to distinguish between true and false, but also human sophistication. Most of the top antique dealers Fei Ying came into contact with abroad graduated from prestigious schools, received systematic training, mastered multiple languages, often dealt with the upper class, had excellent eyesight, and treated people professionally and appropriately. &quot;Overseas, collection is a symbol of cultural taste for the middle class and above, and it has too much cultural value.&quot; The domestic antique industry is not yet mature, and it is unlikely to form hierarchies. Fake goods account for 99% of the market, and those selling old goods Most of the antique dealers have a background in land shoveling, &quot;They all love reading.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The class of domestic antique buyers is uncertain and their origins are unknown, which poses a great challenge to the social skills of antique dealers. One of Fei Ying&#39;s friends facilitated a million-dollar business. When delivering the goods, the other party pointed to the collection at home and asked if these items were good. The friend said honestly: &quot;Some of them are fake.&quot; The other party&#39;s face turned dark immediately, and he didn&#39;t mention the transaction from beginning to end. He drank the tea politely and then sent him away politely. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Antique exchange meetings are held almost every day, and antique dealers with good physical strength can attend the exhibition 360 days a year. You can definitely save money on food, clothing, housing and transportation. Instead of taking airplanes or high-speed trains, you can use long-distance buses, green trains and other old-fashioned means of transportation. The journey is slow. You won’t necessarily stay in a hotel when you arrive. “Isn’t the 75 yuan a night bathing center delicious? There’s breakfast when you get up.” Fei Ying was running an exhibition in Germany. A few people rented a small van and went with the big truck the next morning. Drinking coffee in a container. But it was also this group of people who bought expensive emeralds at the trade fair in a blink of an eye. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the trade fair, they start &quot;fighting&quot; after they like each other. They don&#39;t reveal the bottom price and call each other&#39;s prices, &quot;mutually creating GDP.&quot; The highest transaction volume Fei Ying has ever seen was 1.5 million. After nightfall, only the companions were left. A few of them ordered a late-night snack, bought a few bottles of wine, and began to express their feelings. Even though he was drunk, he still didn’t forget about business: “Let’s talk about that thing during the day.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“The world of antiques is full of deceitful economic behaviors, but it is also in this circle that very innocent and straightforward things will come out. .&quot; For example, there is an antique dealer who thinks that you are my friend. Today you brought other friends to my stall, so I will give you a hundred yuan for them all. &quot;I must give you face when you come.&quot; Again. For example, I know you, we met in this place, and you said that you are not doing well recently, then I must &quot;open&quot; for you (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 毷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Buy you a thing&lt;/span>;). &quot;This is moral justice. If you are polite, I am more polite than you. If you are particular, I am more particular than you.&quot; Fei Ying said, &quot;There is a comfort in this relationship. Now it is no longer an altruistic society, but this industry can still Give profits to others, leave room for others, and every chain can turn.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11 /08/Xp8FoKbddQAKQztmWaWEkVjZ8s9jQ3ae645vlDHi.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;540&quot; height=&quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/Xp8FoKbddQAKQztmWaWEkVjZ8s9jQ3ae645v lDHi.jpg &quot; data-key=&quot;257452&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Fei Ying sets up a stall at the 200th Antique Market in Hangzhou&lt;span style=&quot;color: # aaa;&quot;>;(provided by the interviewee/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Background color&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Fei Ying’s antique enlightenment came from a Henan man who met on the street selling fake goods when he was 10 years old. People (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;&quot;I don&#39;t mean to say anything bad about Henan people.&quot; she added&lt;/span>;). She visited street stalls in Nanjing and was attracted by their fake goods. They offered her snacks and told her they were fake. She was invited to their small workshop and learned a lot of counterfeiting techniques. &quot;Because the technology of counterfeiting is real, all the knowledge surrounding counterfeiting is the knowledge you need to identify the authenticity.&quot; They even taught Fei Ying how to behave, quoting many stories of receiving goods, such as the goods worth 5,000 yuan, the owner of which was in prison because of drug addiction. Yes, I&#39;m willing to sell it for 2,800 yuan. This is a warning: Don&#39;t get involved in pornography, gambling, and drugs. Once you get involved, you will be dead. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The reason why she likes antiques also comes from this experience. &quot;Antiques are the accumulation of a person&#39;s spirit and a very concentrated expression of the aesthetics of an era. For example, everyone says that the aesthetics of the Song Dynasty represents a peak of Chinese aesthetics. If you look at a porcelain bottle, it has the lines of blue and white porcelain. , can we say that this is the highest peak of Chinese aesthetics? This itself is something that makes me think it has more meaning. Antiques can be 100% authentic, but the judgment is moving and there are evolutions in various senses. The whole thing is more attractive to me . It is not like a text. The text does not know whether it is true or false at all. The meaning is completely fluid. Even the meaning of a word is very unstable. It is too easy to be used by many people and then determined to have another meaning. But The object is already a thing of the past. It has its truth and falsehood, and it is a kind of correctness. But on top of that, it has many additional meanings, and this meaning is changing. There are many conflicts and conflicts in between. Pull. I really feel something very futile or meaningless. These aesthetic changes have affected my life and turned me into a cynical person.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Cynicism is Fei Ying Her background makes all the anxieties presented in the novel and born out of life seem to be incapable of hurting her. The portrait that fits her is probably always wandering the streets of all sizes with her arms swaying. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/mehZunkXety5GUzBzrgzkmuuVrCMKFKDHyp7sNK7.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;720&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/mehZunkXety5GUzBzrgzkmuuVrCMKFKDHyp7sNK7.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;257448&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Fei Ying started learning at Yongle Auction&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(provided by the interviewee/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In November 2016, Fei Ying went to renew her residence permit for the next year as required. French administrative processing is very slow, there are too many applications backlogged, the system often crashes, and online appointments cannot be made. She can only queue up at the immigration office in her living area to grab the 50 numbers every day. After two or three failures, she waited in line at 4 a.m. on a snowy night until dawn, and finally sat in front of the immigration staff. The staff arranged for her to submit the materials six months later. One month after submitting the materials, the other party sent a letter telling her that she applied too late and the information was stuck in the police station&#39;s system. It was suggested that she return to the country and apply for a study visa again. She queued up again to appeal, but was rejected. At the same time, because she had made an appeal, her materials were locked by the system and could no longer be accepted. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She just became a gangster. She found a lawyer who specializes in litigating cases for Algerians, who told her that she could go through the process of regularizing her status after two more years of blackmail, which would give her 10 years in law. The lawyer charged 1,800 euros. Fei Ying was shocked by the fee. The other party said: &quot;Because I&#39;m not sure whether I can help you.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The lawyer had two suggestions: &quot;First, take the current paper I tore my passport and applied for a new one. Anyway, the police station and immigration are not connected to the Internet. Secondly, change to another police station. This police station is well-known in the industry for its bad attitude. Let’s change the area.&quot; So she moved to Paris 13 94 Province, a subway station away from Chinatown in the district, started a gamble without a residence document for more than two years. Then there is the story of &quot;Legend of Dzi Beads&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are many things that you cannot do as a gangster, such as working legally. Many people would be anxious for Fei Ying when they saw her doing nothing, but she was really not in a hurry. &quot;Perhaps a personality formed since childhood, I think it is all bad, or it will be like this anyway. Why are you anxious? Life is just like this. Look at your age at the age of three, you don&#39;t know how you became such a person Yes, but I have never been anxious about any problems of my own. If I am anxious, it may only be about social fairness and justice.&quot; She said, &quot;Just like I have a serious and honest attitude towards antiques. , what should this item look like, what era is it from, whether it is real or fake... I will be very serious. I also have the same attitude towards many things in this world, what should this thing be like? In this way, whether everyone gets what he deserves, or even how a book should be evaluated, I may even make a misjudgment at the time, but at that time I was very serious, and it is what it should be. So. But I don’t care enough about a certain material thing that I like, because I think the things I like are fluid after all.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The world seems to be getting worse and worse, indeed. It&#39;s hard to make people feel relaxed, and perhaps this is one of the reasons why Fei Ying has made so many comments on Douban. &quot;Because you can&#39;t handle everything. If you want to express some opinions, you have to bear the consequences. I hope you will be able to bear the consequences in the future, but you may not be able to now. Sometimes your attitude and voice will be misinterpreted. I have seen too many things, and the consequences of too many actions, all happened like this, even if the starting point is good. Even in history, there are too many individual voices that will speak out for some social phenomena, but after speaking out, the entire incident In fact, the direction of the epidemic and the great consequences it will cause cannot be borne by one person. Just like you build a nuclear bomb. Every individual must be responsible for his own words and deeds, just like when I make antiques, I am responsible for what I sell. Every thing is responsible.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 12 Nov 2023 19:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[最早发明指南针的确是中国，但不是司南]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260460]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-12 18:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;As for the compass, one of the four great inventions, like the other three great inventions, there are also many debates in the public. Among the more important ones are &quot;Sinan is a fake, so the compass is also a fake&quot; and &quot;Europe invented the compass one step earlier than China in 1190&quot;. These claims are specious. There is indeed a need to re-examine the invention, spread and significance of the compass. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;True and fake compasses&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;First of all, the &quot;Sinan&quot; we saw in the history books &quot;puts a magnetic spoon on the plate, and no matter how you turn the handle of the spoon, it always points to the south&quot;, It is constructed, and there is no such thing from documents to physical objects. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The literature basis for the view that &quot;Si Nan&quot; is a compass mainly comes from &quot;Han Feizi&quot; of the Warring States Period and &quot;Lunheng&quot; by Wang Chong of the Eastern Han Dynasty. However, this is a misunderstanding or distortion of the documentary records. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Han Feizi·Youdu Pian&quot; states: &quot;The invasion of the master by ladies and ministers is like the terrain, and they gradually pass by, causing the master to make mistakes and change faces from east to west without knowing it. Therefore, the king established &quot;Si Nan means day and night.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Si Nan&quot; here is not a compass, but marks the north-south direction on the court. It means that the king sits north and faces south, and uses magical instruments and rituals to consolidate the dignity of the emperor and the inferiority of his ministers. political landscape. It is very easy to find out where the south is when it is stationary. Just identify it according to the direction of the sun rising in the east and setting in the west. It does not require high technology or instruments such as a compass. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Lunheng·Shiyingpian&quot; states: &quot;The ancients were simple, and when they saw the movement of grass, they could refer to it, and if they could refer to it, they could refer to the sycophants. When Sinan&#39;s ladle was thrown to the ground, it was &quot;Guide.&quot; Fish and flesh insects gather in the ground and travel north, so the nature of insects is the same. Today&#39;s grass can refer to it, and it is also nature.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Chong&#39;s purpose in writing this article is to oppose the influence of heaven and man in the Confucian classics of the Han Dynasty This concept believes that the characteristics of natural things are their own nature and has nothing to do with human affairs. The two examples cited are &quot;Sinan&#39;s Ladle&quot; and &quot;Fish and Flesh Worms&quot;. &quot;Lao&quot; refers to the Big Dipper, not a spoon. The meaning of the sentence &quot;Sinan&#39;s ladle, thrown to the ground, is a guide&quot; means that the Big Dipper (like a spoon shape) with guiding properties is projected to the ground, and the handle of the spoon is The direction it points to is south, but this is just a characteristic of the Big Dipper itself and has nothing to do with personnel. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It can be seen that whether it is &quot;Han Feizi&quot; or &quot;Lunheng&quot;, the &quot;Si Nan&quot; mentioned has nothing to do with the compass. So, why can the &quot;Sinan&quot; with a spoon on the plate, which was constructed due to misinterpretation of the literature, really be a guide? Because this thing is artificially magnetized using modern technology. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1947, Wang Zhenduo made the so-called &quot;Sinan&quot; with a spoon on the plate based on the record of &quot;Sinan&#39;s ladle, throw it on the ground, and guide it&quot;. He claimed that no matter how the magnet rotates on the plate, it will It will eventually point to the south, so I successfully copied &quot;Sinan&quot;. The truth is that because the spoon is too big, the friction when rotating on the plate is too great. The magnetism of the natural magnet cannot restrain the friction. Wang Zhenduo put the natural magnet into the magnetic field to magnetize it to achieve the effect of always guiding. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The ancients did not have magnetization technology, so it was impossible to make &quot;Si Nan&quot; that did not exist in the literature. It is untenable to regard &quot;Si Nan&quot; as a compass. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some people also believe that based on the records of magnets in the ancient Chinese books &quot;Lu Shi Chun Qiu&quot; and &quot;Huainan Zi&quot;, China has recognized the magnetism of magnets in ancient times and was able to create compasses at that time. This statement is also specious. Recognizing that magnets have magnetism to attract iron does not mean that they also recognize that magnets naturally have the characteristic of pointing to the South Pole. The polarity of magnets was not recorded until the Song Dynasty, so it is impossible to have invented it in the Warring States, Qin and Han Dynasties. Compass. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhang Heng of the Eastern Han Dynasty, Ma Jun of the Cao Wei Dynasty, and Zu Chongzhi of the Southern Dynasty invented the compass car. However, the compass car did not use magnetism to indicate the direction, but used gear friction to keep the wooden figure on the car pointing in one direction. Although this invention has its value, factors such as wheel size errors and uneven road surfaces will cause deviations in the direction of the wooden man. Secondly, it cannot be used for navigation, so it is of little use. Therefore, it will be lost and reinvented many times. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The controversy between water compass and dry compass&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;However, although Sinan was constructed and the compass is not that amazing, the compass was indeed invented by the Chinese first. The evidence is strong. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During the reign of Emperor Renzong of the Song Dynasty, Yang Weide, an official of Sitiantai, mentioned in the &quot;Fuyuan Zonglu&quot; that the &quot;Bingwu needle&quot; pointed at a constant point was used to survey Feng Shui, and the &quot;Wu Jing Zong Yao&quot; mentioned that giving iron pieces a certain Magnetism made a &quot;guide fish&quot;, which floated in the water bowl and used the guide method. This was about the 1040s AD. In the Song Shenzong era that followed, the compass had achieved greater development. Shen Kuo&#39;s &quot;Mengxi Bi Tan&quot; mentioned four forms of compasses, including the water float method, the bowl-lip spiral method, the nail spiral method, and the thread-suspended method. And think that the wisp method is the best. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The earliest record of the use of compasses in navigation can be found in Zhu Yu&#39;s &quot;Pingzhou Ke Tan&quot; in the late Northern Song Dynasty. It is said that &quot;the boat master knows the geography, observes the stars at night, observes the sun during the day, and observes the sun when it is dark.&quot; Observe the Compass” (1120s AD). The &quot;earth snail&quot; mentioned in Zeng Sanyi&#39;s &quot;Yin Hua Lu&quot; in the early Southern Song Dynasty (1170s) was a compass designed by Feng Shui masters to improve the equipment for observing Feng Shui. The compass still used a floating needle guide with water, but Subdividing the azimuth scale allows people to grasp the direction more accurately. This is also the earliest recorded compass in the world, but there is no evidence that the compass was used for navigation at this time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is some controversy as to whether the dry compass was invented in China or Europe. Because according to existing documents, Europe may have mastered the dry compass before the Arabs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1190, the British theologian Alexander Nicham mentioned in &quot;On the Nature of Nature&quot; that &quot;a needle placed on a fulcrum will point out the direction of navigation after the rotation stops&quot;, which is very descriptive. It&#39;s like a dry compass, and the earliest Arab document recording a compass was Muhammad Ofi&#39;s &quot;Collection of Stories&quot; in 1232, after the Europeans, and it recorded a water compass rather than a dry compass. Some foreign scholars believe that the Chinese invented the water compass and influenced the Islamic world, but the Europeans independently invented the dry compass and were the first to use it for navigation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the earliest Chinese classic that clearly records the dry compass is the &quot;Yin Hua Lu&quot; in the 1170s. In 1985, it was discovered in the tomb of Zhu Jinan, the military commander of Song Shaowu in Linchuan, Jiangxi (buried in 1198). The &quot;Zhang Xianren&quot; pottery figurine holding a dry compass indicates that the dry compass should have been born in China first. However, its age is too close to the year 1190 when the dry compass was recorded in Europe. It is difficult to determine that the dry compass was spread from China to Europe based on these alone. It is still very possible that China and Europe independently invented the dry compass. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, there were some vague records of suspected dry compasses in China before this. The &quot;Jiutian Xuannv Qingnang Haijiao Jing&quot; written by Guo Pu of the Eastern Jin Dynasty is believed to be a Tang Dynasty classic, which records that it was used as a guide. Regarding the heaven and earth, Wang Ji&#39;s Feng Shui work &quot;Compass Yijing&quot; in the early Northern Song Dynasty also used the phrase &quot;the needle is clear between virtual dangers and dangers, and the three-way south is open; it is difficult for people to distinguish the right position, but it is indistinguishable.&quot; A poem like &quot;Spirit&quot; records a compass-like device. It is very likely that China invented the dry compass much earlier than the Southern Song Dynasty, so it had time to spread westward to Europe. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, in China, the dry compass has been used in geomantic omen, and in Europe it was quickly used for navigation. By the Jiajing period of the 16th century, the Chinese were inspired by the Europeans coming from the East and used it to The dry compass, which has been used for navigation for hundreds of years, has been used to read Feng Shui. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For the ancient people who believed deeply in religion, new inventions were often religious items first and then put into practical use. The evolution of the function of the dry compass also conforms to this law. However, Europe was the first to put the newly acquired dry compass into practical use, and its technology was converted into productivity faster than China. This also shows that the social vitality of Europe in the High Middle Ages was even better than that of the Song Dynasty, the most dynamic dynasty in Chinese history. At this time, it is no longer important to argue about who invented the dry compass first. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The compass is one of the important navigation technologies&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The Song Dynasty was a rare era in which China allowed its own merchant ships to operate at sea. Therefore, after the invention of the compass and the water compass, within a few decades, 12 It was passed to the Islamic world in the late 13th century. In the 13th century Muhammad Offi&#39;s collection of Persian anecdotes, &quot;The Encyclopedia of Stories,&quot; records the story of using iron pieces similar to Chinese guide fish to find paths, which is enough to prove that the technology was passed from China. Europeans were the first to put dry compasses into navigation, but their ability to use the compass&#39;s guiding properties was probably also influenced by China. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Compasses are indeed a great help to world navigation technology, especially in the Mediterranean region. There are many cloudy days in the Mediterranean. The traditional navigation technology of positioning oneself based on the sun, moon and stars will be greatly reduced or even completely ineffective on cloudy and rainy days. At this time, the role of the compass is extremely precious. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, in the long run, the compass is only one of many important navigation technologies and should not be overly deified. The statement that &quot;without the compass, there would be no Age of Discovery&quot; is even more inconsistent with the facts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the Neolithic Age, the primitive people of Oceania already had very outstanding navigation technology through the observation of ocean currents, celestial bodies, animals, and clouds, so they only used simple canoes, or at most they had outboards. The pallets were used to load supplies and transport people, but they were able to colonize the Pacific islands from Southeast Asia all the way east to Easter Island, which is not far from South America. To the west, they crossed the Indian Ocean to the African island of Madagascar. Such a magnificent ancient &quot;Age of Discovery&quot; did not require a compass to be realized. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the 1st century, the Greek Hipparus discovered the pattern of the Indian Ocean monsoon. From then on, the ships of the Roman Empire could take advantage of the monsoon to reach India directly without having to detour along the coast, which greatly shortened the voyage. The connection between the Eurasian continent has been significantly strengthened, and the technological content is only above the compass, not below it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since the 8th century, the Vikings have used simple segmented wooden sticks or even raised an arm or a finger to observe the declination with the corresponding celestial body to determine their position. There was no compass when sailing from Scandinavia to Iceland, Greenland and even the Americas. From this we can see that even without a compass, Columbus could still have discovered the New World, but it was just more difficult. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, before and after the compass, other civilizations also possessed many important navigation technologies, but these technologies did not promote navigation under the compass. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, in the astrolabe of ancient Greece, sailors could arrange the relative positions of celestial bodies in the sky at a specific time. If the sailor could determine the date and time, he could adjust the copper rings representing different latitudes. When the aligned celestial bodies are aligned with the projection position of the celestial body you are currently seeing, you can determine your latitude. This position indication function for sailors is still better than that of a compass, but observing celestial objects requires clear weather and is subject to climate restrictions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another example is the quadrant invented in the 17th century and the sextant invented in the 18th century. You can determine your latitude by measuring the height of celestial bodies, and the operation is easier than an astrolabe. During the day, measure the angle between the sun and the horizon. At night, measure the angle between Polaris and the horizon in the northern hemisphere, and measure the angle between the Southern Cross and the horizon in the southern hemisphere. Just move the indicator arm to align the sun, Polaris or the Southern Cross with the horizon. You can get your latitude on the indicator arm. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Determining the longitude of a sailor is much more difficult than the latitude, but by 1736, the British carpenter John Harrison invented the sea clock, which solved this century-old problem. As long as the sea clock is set to Greenwich Mean Time in the UK, no matter where the sailor is sailing, as long as he looks at the time on the sea clock at noon when the sun is highest, he can deduce how far he is from Greenwich and thus determine his longitude. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;None of the above important inventions have any impact on navigation. The progress of world navigation technology is the result of the joint efforts of various civilizations. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The compass stagnated in China but progressed in Europe&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Whether or not the European dry compass navigation was influenced by the Chinese compass, the compass is undoubtedly a Chinese invention. But it is a pity that China invented the compass and that was it. Europe continued to improve the dry compass, and through the study of the compass, it inspired the development of cartography and magnetism. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The 13th-century French scholar Peregrinus, based on his research on compasses, wanted to use magnetism as a power device for weapons. In a letter to a friend, he talked about a more comprehensive understanding of magnetism. Zhi, pioneered the study of magnetism. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the beginning of the 14th century, the Italian Amalfitani invented the &quot;compass card&quot;, a land compass that rotates with the needle, making the direction of the magnetic needle clearer. At the same time, the Italians also used compass bearing lines to draw nautical charts, making the nautical charts much more accurate than the TO world maps of the European Middle Ages. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After entering the age of iron ships, European and American sailors realized that the magnetic force of the iron ship itself would interfere with the compass. They installed a piece of Flinderston iron on the compass to offset the compass error caused by the iron ship&#39;s magnetic field. , which became a common practice for iron ships in the 19th century. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1906, the German H. Anhuiz invented the gyrocompass. The rapidly rotating gyroscope will use the rotation of the earth to find the true north direction of the area, and will not be affected by the geomagnetic field and nearby metals. Impact, ideal for use inside metal carriers. Gyroscopic wheels were quickly adopted by European and American navies, and were later used more extensively in the aerospace field. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1932, the radio compass was put into practical use in the Air Force. The radio compass determines the direction of the aircraft by calculating the angle between the aircraft and the released radio waves, providing the pilot with clear directions, which is another big step forward in compass technology. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Technology can only develop through continuous use. During the Ming and Qing Dynasties, the country was generally closed to the outside world, and no one was allowed to enter the sea. Although the private smuggling industry was quite prosperous, under the attack of the imperial court, the navigation industry in East Asia was still greatly affected, and it was natural for science and technology to stagnate. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since the Zhou and Qin Dynasties, China has had the idea of ​​​​&quot;celestial empire&quot;. It regards its neighboring countries as barbarians and has little enthusiasm for exchanges. The Song and Yuan dynasties were rare exceptions, so the compass was invented. However, in the Ming and Qing Dynasties, along with the ban on sea policy and the decrease in exchanges with overseas countries, the arrogance and arrogance became even stronger, which also prevented the people from spontaneously improving the compass. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Even in the Song and Yuan dynasties, which were relatively loose and socially dynamic, there was still an upper limit under the control of the Qin system. With the freight volume at that time, there may not be an urgent need to improve the compass, so although the Song Dynasty The compass was a rare invention, but there were not many further improvements. Therefore, only in a society with relaxed systems, open ideas, and active society can science and technology flourish. This is what the history of Compass has taught us. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 12 Nov 2023 18:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[被检出兽药残存，明治召回4.4万瓶牛奶！客服回应了]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260470]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-12 16:30:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Remnants of veterinary drugs were detected in Meiji milk, a well-known Japanese dairy brand. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On November 11, according to the Japan Broadcasting Association (NHK), the famous Japanese dairy brand Meiji Milk announced the recall of 44,000 bottles of bottled milk that have been on the market due to the detection of veterinary drug residues in the products. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/12/9c973624a99c1a9fc552d3637d344bcc.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;602&quot; height=&quot;339&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/12/9c973624a99c1a9fc552d3637d344bcc.png&quot; data-key=&quot;258011&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;It is understood that this veterinary drug residue is called sulfamethoxazole, which is commonly used to prevent or treat infectious diseases in cattle or pigs.

So far, about 44,000 bottles of the product have been recalled.

It is said that if you have never used or even heard a term starting with &quot;Princess please&quot;, then you are already behind the Internet trend. This new &quot;meme&quot; on the Internet is not only used as a joke between parents, children and spouses, but also used by some businesses for &quot;Double Eleven&quot; promotions and live broadcasts to bring goods. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The prototype of the line &quot;Princess please&quot; comes from the classic old movie &quot;Roman Holiday&quot;. The reporter played by Gregory Peck said &quot;Princess please&quot; to the princess played by Audrey Hepburn. &quot;Get in the car&quot;; and &quot;Princess please&quot; became an Internet meme, which originated from a funny video on Douyin: a father picked up his daughter on a bicycle, but the daughter said &quot;You said &#39;Princess please get in the car&#39;&quot;. Unexpectedly, the father did not continue riding away, leaving his daughter behind to chase him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After this funny video became popular on the short video platform, it immediately brought about a wave of imitation and secondary creation. The main promoters were short video bloggers and e-commerce platform merchants, which gave rise to &quot; More hot memes like &quot;Princess please drink tea&quot;, &quot;Princess please dine&quot;, &quot;Princess please sign for receipt&quot; and &quot;Princess please place order&quot; can be described as a victory of &quot;emotional marketing&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the carnival of &quot;Princess Please&quot; has gradually emerged with some new &quot;games&quot;, and its negative externalities are worthy of attention. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One is the &quot;identity&quot; issue of the &quot;Princess Please&quot; short video on the Internet platform. A careful review of these &quot;Princess Please&quot; videos on the short video platform can be roughly divided into three types: one is completely staged and belongs to situational skits; the other is a real shot on the spot, with immediate reactions to the real shot; the third is difficult to distinguish between true and false. It’s not marked and can’t be seen, which is problematic in itself. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These short videos are common on social media platforms: bloggers find the takeaway guy and ask him to say &quot;Princess, please dine&quot;; ask the boss at the restaurant to cooperate in filming &quot;Princess, please dine&quot;; ask the bus and An online ride-hailing driver said &quot;Princess, please get out of the car&quot;; he asked security guards at the school gate to say &quot;Princess, please go back to school&quot;; recently in Nanjing, Jiangsu, a woman who fell asked an ambulance doctor to say &quot;Princess, please get in the car&quot;; and even in Yunnan Province In a certain hospital, a surgeon appeared in the process of operating on a patient and said &quot;Please princess, please remove the electric knife&quot; and &quot;Please say thank you princess&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is obvious at a glance that most of these &quot;Princess Please&quot; short videos are fictitious and staged, but the result is that they appear to be &quot;real-looking&quot;. Such an unlabeled operation is inevitable Non-compliant. Disguising it as news to mislead the public is not without the suspicion of guiding public opinion. I would like to ask, will the proliferation of &quot;Princess Please&quot; videos create the illusion that &quot;all walks of life say &quot;Princess Please&quot; is a reality, and in turn &quot;force&quot; all walks of life to &quot;must say Princess please&quot;? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In July 2023, the Cyberspace Administration of China issued the &quot;Notice on Strengthening the Management of &quot;We-Media&quot;&quot;, which is commonly known as the &quot;Thirteen Articles&quot;, including &quot;annotation of fictitious content or controversial information&quot; Requirements for &quot;label&quot; (Article 5): When &quot;self-media&quot; publishes content that contains fictional plots and plot interpretations, the website platform should require it to mark the fiction or interpretation label in a conspicuous manner. If the staged &quot;Princess Please&quot; is not marked and deliberately makes it difficult to distinguish the authenticity, it will inevitably be suspected of violating this law. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Secondly, whether staged or real, the proliferation of &quot;Princess Please&quot; videos has brought about problems of blurred boundaries and emotional blackmail. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When parents, children and spouses say &quot;Princess please&quot;, it is an emotional interaction between close relatives; when e-commerce platform customer service personnel say &quot;Princess please&quot;, it is to use emotional marketing to promote actual transactions. Follow It is also the market principle of voluntary transactions; and if strangers who are neither relatives nor friends must be forced to say &quot;Princess please&quot; in front of the camera, and even public authorities follow the &quot;playful joke&quot;, this will cause a problem. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to those &quot;princess please&quot; short videos that are obviously staged, there is also a type of &quot;princess please&quot; that is real and even more worrying: the head teacher takes advantage of his position to ask a whole room of primary school students to shout &quot; Princess, please leave the get out of class.&quot; &quot;Beautiful princess, please leave the class.&quot; Children don&#39;t quite understand what posing is, so teaching them to cooperate in a performance only requires &quot;coercion and inducement.&quot; This approach is tantamount to using one&#39;s position to coerce children to satisfy their own emotional values ​​and help them harvest traffic. It is not compliant with the procedures and unfair in the results. It is not the way to teach and educate people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Official accounts of government departments also use &quot;Princess Please&quot; to promote laws and regulations. It seems to be a closer relationship and facilitates dissemination, but it can easily give people the impression of not being serious in the long run. It is also detrimental to popularize legal knowledge and promote citizens to abide by the law: what public authorities need is to perform their statutory duties, strictly abide by the law and strictly enforce the law. How can they show such a humble attitude of &quot;asking people to abide by the law&quot; and &quot;asking people to abide by the law&quot;? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Thirdly, the popular &quot;Princess Please&quot; is just another &quot;Internet meme&quot; destined to have a short life cycle, but it has characteristics that are different from previous &quot;Internet memes&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Princess Please&quot; is not the first-generation Internet meme of &quot;emotional marketing&quot;. Memes such as &quot;kiss&quot; and &quot;little fairy&quot; have been circulated for several times. Online language ebbs and flows, coming and going quickly. This is what is commonly known as &quot;language inflation&quot; (referred to as &quot;call inflation&quot;): just like currency, the &quot;face value&quot; of language is getting larger and larger, and the value it expresses is getting bigger and bigger. However, its &quot;value&quot; is getting smaller and smaller, and the thoughts and feelings it can carry are becoming increasingly poor. All kinds of &quot;internet memes&quot; are overused but internally poor, and have become quickly decaying words instead of meaningful idioms, which is the natural ending. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;No matter how you play &quot;Princess Please&quot;, it should still follow the principle of voluntariness, there must be boundaries, public power should not be involved, and teachers should not engage in emotional blackmail from students. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 12 Nov 2023 15:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[涉嫌贩卖出生医学证明，广西南宁相关医院责任人已被采取刑事强制措施]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260468]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-12 15:14:51&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;The reporter learned from the Nanning Municipal Health Commission in Guangxi that people reported that a hospital in Nanning was suspected of selling medical birth certificates , the obstetrics and gynecology department of the hospital involved has been suspended for rectification, and criminal coercive measures have been taken against the relevant responsible persons of the hospital. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After a joint investigation by the health, public security and other departments, it was found that the hospital involved was Nanning Chenghe Hospital, and relevant work such as investigation and evidence collection is being further carried out.

As the Tang Dynasty spread eastward, screens were introduced to Japan. The Japanese often placed them at the door of their homes to block the sneaky atmosphere. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/PAzTf0V0D61jhUAk8q0ZEIGxbcxPmV5dD99omqKG.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/PAzTf0V0D61jhUAk8q0ZEIGxbcxPmV5dD99omqKG.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;257466&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hide Both architecture and storage are oriental. Whether it is architecture, gardens or homes, Eastern aesthetics are most afraid of &quot;getting straight to the point&quot;. Direct access is ultimately vulgar. &quot;Shadow walls&quot; and &quot;stone screens&quot; must be built to block the line of sight. This is also in another sense. Screen - In &quot;Dream of Red Mansions&quot;, in order to welcome Concubine Yuan to the royal family, a lot of effort was put into building a luxurious Grand View Garden. As soon as he entered the garden, he first built a rockery with green peaks to block all the scenery. Jia Zheng explained, &quot;If it weren&#39;t for this mountain, what would be the point of seeing all the scenery in the garden when you enter?&quot; One sentence broke through the screen. The psychological motivation of existence: to welcome but also to reject, the winding path leads to the secluded place, &quot;the more you explore the scenery, the better you will get&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When screens were introduced to the West, their shapes and techniques had become diverse. People in the Baroque period even used them as props in dramas and operas, whether to beautify the stage, indicate scenery, or isolate narrative space. The performance capabilities of the screens are all top-notch. By the 19th century, many artists, architects and designers had widely adopted this form, giving screens more artistic expression. The screen therefore also has multiple identities: is it a painting or a sculpture? Is it art or furniture? Is it a practical object or a decorative item? Is it a prop or a device? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/Zv6COcmOL4pHzHQDlEu5BM8Rw5PaeU8ZZx5zVuCu.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/Zv6COcmOL4pHzHQDlEu5BM8Rw5PaeU8ZZx5zVuCu.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;257468&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;None The standard answer is that the screen answers this unsolvable proposition with its complex and diverse attitude. In modern society, &quot;screen&quot; has also been given more and more meanings. We are surrounded by various &quot;screens&quot;, isolating and attracting us. This was the inspiration for the exhibition Paraventi: Screen. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is a comprehensive exhibition that shuttles between many cultures. This one located in PRADA Rongzhai in Shanghai is a branch of its global exhibitions, and therefore has more Chinese colors. . A royal rosewood screen from the 18th century conveys the most classic and elegant appearance of the Chinese screen. This is a screen commonly used by ancient literati. The 12 surrounding screens are hinged to each other and can be arranged in an alternating pattern or in a single line. Or arranged in an arc, there is a place for posting paintings above each fan board. Generally, the owner will entrust the artist to customize a group of 12 paintings, which are painted on rice paper or silk and then pasted on the screen. Sometimes the owner himself is also proficient in it. Painting skills, painting screens have become elegant props for displaying works and offering appreciation. Ancient screens were often moved and the paintings were easily damaged. Therefore, the owners often removed their favorite works from the screen and framed them in scrolls for preservation. Therefore, the paintings on the screen could be replaced frequently. It is for this reason that most of the surviving ancient screens do not have paintings posted on them. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another common Chinese-style screen is the single-leaf vertical screen that has a history of more than 2,000 years in China. This type of screen is usually made of stone or brick. One of the screens on display in Rongzhai This kind of small stone screen is often placed on the desk. The stone wall inlaid on it has patterns that resemble mountains and rivers, and also represents the ravines in the mind of the scribes. This small desk screen is not just for viewing. It has a very practical functionality. When the owner is writing and painting, the desk screen can prevent the draft from drying the ink quickly. It is one of the important study rooms. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among the many contemporary screen works in the exhibition hall, the one that amazed me the most was the work of the video artist Cao Fei, who completely transformed Rotunda No. 1 of Rongzhai into a green screen. The blue and green curtains outline oval screens, echoing the blue and green stained glass in the windows of the old bungalows. There are many images displayed in the exhibition hall, all related to &quot;green screen&quot;. As we all know, green screen and blue screen are important props in the imaging industry and are often used to create virtual scenes. Cao Fei photographed many scenes in modern life: strong men pedaling bicycles with green screens on their backs, men and women spinning green screens wildly on public fitness equipment, beauties staring at a green screen on the beach, in blue, blue, and green screens. The blue screen and green screen in the green trash can, and the fierce woman using the green screen as a target to practice fighting in the elevator room seems to be Cao Fei himself... Among all these images, images will appear intermittently on those green screens. ，但片刻之后又会恢复成绿幕，循环往复，仿佛一段亦真亦假的寓言，不断提醒我们：在一个被视频充斥的时代，我们目之所及，看到的影像都可能是虚拟的，不真实的，不值得信任的。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/nKn2fq2DqnXA4To94A6o5CmsM5655OqlEN17GRnm.jpg&quot;

&lt;p>;曹斐说，她小时候在故宫里看到令人望而却步的豪华屏风，在她生长的南中国，各种雕龙画凤的旧式屏风也并不稀见，总是有充足空间的大户人家才配使用屏风。但让她感到亲切的反倒是那些简易的、有温度的、普通人也能够使用的屏风，淡绿色的棉布帘子绷在架子上，提供最简单的遮挡。需要打针的人就躲进这屏风后面，脱出半个屁股供护士扎针……但站在影像的角度，她眼中的“屏”，意味着另一种隔绝和遮挡。 “随着直播文化的盛行，绿幕技术赋予了屏幕新的流动性、不确定性和虚构性，重塑了我们所看到的世界……它就像直播视频背后的现实：除了一块光秃秃的&#39;绿幕&#39;之外，什么都没有。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“作为一个影像艺术家，我早就已经不信任图像了。”曹斐说，这也正是她这组作品想要表达的，“我们正真实地生活在这样一个图像不可信、现实无法确定、每一帧都不相同的时代。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 12 Nov 2023 14:55:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[湖北襄阳“健桥医院贩卖出生证”最新通报 叶某芝等6名犯罪嫌疑人被批捕]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260463]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-12 13:26:22&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;11月12日，湖北襄阳市人民政府发布通报，11月6日，网民举报襄阳健桥医院（襄城区陈侯巷169号，民营，法定代表人叶某芝，女，55岁）贩卖出生医学证明等问题后，襄阳市立即成立由市委、市政府主要领导任组长、相关市领导为各工作组负责人，市公安、卫健、纪检监察等部门组成的工作专班，从严从快、依法依规开展问题调查、案件侦办和追责问责等工作。 &lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;如去年一样，不止一支表演队伍踩高跷，穿着戏服，从昭明书院的堂内缓缓出发巡游。但今年，窄窄的西栅大街（&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;一条通常只容三人并行的石板路&lt;/span>;）竟然塞了六排观众。踩高跷的演员向西行去，一拨人跟着，一拨人趁着交通拥堵缓解，往反方向走。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/KErtoyLZGqm2nn09wInla1PNLXgX2A4inb3N8rs0.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;762&quot; height=&quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/KErtoyLZGqm2nn09wInla1PNLXgX2A4inb3N8rs0.jpg&quot;

&lt;p>;今年许多人喜穿古装悠游拍照，乌镇也是，我更恍惚，古时人们逛庙会是否也如此。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/S1c7XN0lLP0OauLPRUnpMnZp1BN4gXOWsF1qikSc.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;

text-align: center;&quot;>;饰演诡计多端小丑的演员&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;乌镇戏剧节总策划丁乃竺推介古镇嘉年华时说，“人生百态，戏剧百态，你可以是观众，你也可以融入其中。”去年乌镇戏剧节11月底举办，在新冠疫情防疫政策最严格的时候，而今年，至少四倍于去年的游客进入西栅，观众与嘉年华演出的联结更加紧密。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;算上这对英豪在内，雨读桥下，连着就有三个演戏点。每个点外观众都围成圈，三个圈子挤在一起，几乎要产生交集了，我站在桥上看，比武的英豪不远处在演肢体剧，两三把椅子、一块白布、若干玫瑰花瓣，构成整个表演场域。男女演员用白布盖上椅子，撒玫瑰花瓣，转圈、对视，推倒椅子，不讲话，用这些动作来表达他们的情感变化。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/LeiTvAm2ANJ6J6jZbHNhS0X3FbRmTtHMDj3UsYoE.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;701&quot; height=&quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/LeiTvAm2ANJ6J6jZbHNhS0X3FbRmTtHMDj3UsYoE.jpg&quot;

&lt;p>;“杀手！”有人声音最大。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;好，演杀手。接下来是癖好。 “跳女团舞！”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这时，猜谜的演员被叫回来，他的同伴表演一名跳女团舞的杀手，他来猜。猜不中，观众可以发出嘘声。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/sE2zbaL4adSbK90lNB3fPWBzo03qQKVh0kzXK6Ng.jpg&quot;

&lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;桥边的环境实验戏剧《半人马2023》，后半段有些冷场&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这类注重互动的嘉年华演出今年非常多。比如有两个小丑发红白两色的气球棒，将上前参与的观众分成红白两队，小孩子很踊跃。白队的小丑夸张地偷换掉红队小丑的气球。小小的男孩女孩（&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;家长给他们扮成古时的少爷小姐&lt;/span>;）并不怯场，跟着白小丑逗红小丑玩。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一天我赶往日月广场采访准备彩排的戏剧导演，广场被三个高大的俄罗斯表演者及几排观众占据，好像很精彩。采访时，我还能听到风琴声和游客的鼓掌欢呼。第二天同一时间我又过此处，果然捕到三个东欧人，蒸汽朋克打扮，一人拉风琴，一人吹黑管，一人打鼓，每人头顶各一盏灵活转动的灯，可以拉亮（&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;我并不懂这个设计的意义所在&lt;/span>;）。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;演出有二十来分钟，中间几度，三个人或自我介绍，或与观众交流，没有翻译，在场应该也没有人听懂，但大家很有默契，东欧人话语一停，纷纷欢呼鼓掌，毫不吝惜热情。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;也有的很古典。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/7zigEVt8BqTYVKmW1vdEhjI9kAsVpA5VcC6lWNQh.jpg&quot;

&lt;p>;昭明书院是为纪念南朝梁太子萧统而建，内院扩大，成为乌镇嘉年华许多演出的表演地点。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;巧合之下，我有一天就在昭明书院看了两次《知己》，都只看到了后一半，伯牙的独角戏：那是改编的伯牙子期的故事，书院空地处，有古琴一张、颂钵一个。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/GO7Nowll01yN3UFYlGRCbFTdZXL2HpbHv6He1ygC.jpg&quot;

&lt;p>;下午我转场想休息，在河边咖啡馆坐下，抬头，桥上竟然又是子期，白袍红绸很抢眼。编辑和我讨论工作，过了十几分钟我抬头，子期还在桥上，有人在拍他。这时我身边坐下两个游客，一个说，“我在桥下看风景，看风景的人在桥上看你，是不是？”“什么？”另一个回。先前说话的人指指子期，“我记得有句这个话，是不是？”这时子期下桥，仿佛去看河对岸的演出了。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 12 Nov 2023 13:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[刘润“翻车”后左支右绌：“商业战略大师”到底是门什么生意？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260450]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-12 12:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;著名商业咨询师刘润“翻车”，破圈了，缘于2023年10月28日所举行的年度演讲中的一段表述。刘润在演讲中称，品牌折扣MAMA店用3年时间在全国开出2500家店，总营收超过17亿。这组数据受到多方质疑。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;折扣牛创始人马昕彤在抖音发布视频称，根据公开的折扣MAMA创始人自述，这个品牌在今年9月份的时候，应该是20家至30家店，年流水应该是不过亿的。还有网友在留言中质疑道，“17个亿，2500家店，平均每个店一年就卖68万左右吗？还有这2500家店都主要开在哪里了呢？”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;刘润反复解释，称“演讲里和全文稿里都有解释”“这2500家店，包括自营的店、联名的店和供应链支撑的店”“这个数字，经过邢云飞本人确认”。 MAMA创始人邢云飞也回应称，折扣MAMA全国直营、联营、供应链托管支撑的门店4000+云云。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;刘润甚至发表题为《刘润：2700家店，17亿，折扣MAMA的数据，到底是不是臆想的？ 》的文章，“蹭我的流量没有关系，但是，你误导了很多真诚的创业者”引发了更多的不满。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;左支右绌一番后，刘润终于在11月2日在微博发布致歉信，承认几处错误。风波告一段落。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;其实，刘润在年度演讲中的错误是很明显的，正如他自己最后承认的，所谓“2500家店”并不是MAMA开设的，绝大部分都是MAMA“服务”的商业伙伴。如果把供应链上下游、联名之类的商业合作伙伴都算到品牌开的店，中国要增加多少“独角兽”企业？更为讽刺的是，按照合作都算的注水口径，邢云飞给出的数据是4000家以上，说明刘润演讲中提到的“2500家”也很不准确，莫不是折中的“模糊处理”？商业咨询专业人士的年度演讲，不应该出现这样低级的数据错误。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;低级错误不应该，错了还不及时承认更不应该了。人非圣贤，孰能无过。过而能改，善莫大焉。错了就大大方方承认，再作出合理的解释，这是危机公关最基本的处理原则。刘润却没有这样做，应该不是不懂，而是立人设、做流量的“网红”商业模式导致动作变形。商业咨询的生意不能这样做，但是“网红”的流量生意就得这么做。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;互联网兴起以来，涌现了一批网红“商业咨询师”，或所谓“商业战略大师”。他们的履历光鲜，大串头衔如过江之鲫。刘润就是其中的代表人物。但是，这些“商业咨询师”的经营模式和传统商业咨询行业大相径庭。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;活跃在网上的“商业咨询师”IP化、媒体化，热衷于大众传播的“to C”生意，而不是传统商业咨询机构服务企业的“to B”业务。比如刘润的头衔里有多家大型企业的战略顾问，但是公众很难了解他对这些企业的战略优化有多大贡献，也很难了解他和他的商业团队从这些企业咨询业务中获得了多少营收。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;刘润最为引人瞩目的商业成就是昂贵的线上课程、更昂贵的线下课程，给他带来的巨额收入。刘润售课的主力平台“得到”的母公司思维造物招股书显示，从2017年开始，刘润连续四年出现在“得到”的重大采购合同中。 2017至2020年，刘润获得总计5800万的线上线下课程收益。刘润的IP已经成了“得到”的优质资产。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;很难用传统商业咨询业务的标准评价刘润的事业，可以肯定的是，刘润是非常成功的互联网内容生产者，IP价值很高的“网红”。今天互联网上活跃的“商业咨询师”基本上都是这样的情形，很难看到他们的咨询业务多么成功，知识付费的内容传播渠道才是主要营收来源。传统商业咨询当然也赚培训费，但是课不是这么卖的，受众也不是这样“有教无类”的有教无类。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;传统商业咨询机构的服务对象是很有限的，中小型机构通常只对几家长期客户负责，大型机构也不过数十上百家的长期客户。他们的服务需要不断接受客户的绩效考核，每一个“金点子”、每一份专题报告、每一堂培训课，都要对企业经营有切实的帮助。而“商业咨询师”以十万、百万计的流量，意味着受众群体巨大，实际绩效难以统计。 “商业咨询师”妙语连珠的金句中，到底让多少买课的“学生”获得商业收益，无人统计，也无从统计。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;如果一定要把这种内容创作和传播归类为商业咨询业的话，那只能说是商业咨询业的培训分支走向“下沉市场”。受众庞大、良莠不齐，具体场景千差万别，不可能提供传统商业咨询业的定制化服务，传播效果就是这个下沉市场的追逐目标。这个“下沉市场”竞争的是流量，而不是服务绩效。因此，主要竞争手段是表达技巧，而不是促进受众商业利益的实际绩效。宏观叙事华丽，微观多灌心灵鸡汤，新概念和金句齐飞，语不惊人死不休都是为了吸引更多的粉丝、收获更多的流量。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“商业咨询师”“商业战略大师”的行为模式更接近其他做流量生意的“网红”，而不是传统商业咨询机构。他们要和所有网红一样，永远以维护人设和流量基本盘为最高优先级。传统商业咨询机构既没有这样的“流量压力”，也不存在搪塞、糊弄的空间——客户都是内行，不好糊弄。即使糊弄一时，最终绩效出问题也是枉然。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;总之，互联网活跃的“商业咨询师”不是商业咨询业的网络化，而是商业文化传播的网红化。 “网红化”本身并非贬义。用对了，可以提高信息传播效率，有利于知识和观点的普及。但是，用错了，却会成为行业水平下降、职业道德滑坡的起点。刘润低级错误在前、不肯认错在后，可以归类为后者。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“商业咨询师”作为互联网时代的新兴行业，要有乐见其成的宽容，但也需要吃一堑长一智的警觉。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这一事件对“商业咨询师”行业是个警示。传播商业文化没有错，但是不要过度拔高行业定位。大部分都是面向大众传播商业知识的内容生产者，何必挂“商业咨询”的“羊头”？微观的商业场景千差万别，细分市场五花八门，纵有通天彻地之能，能给多少用户提供咨询服务？强行造IP、卖人设的虚张声势，有违商业精神。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;对知识付费的消费者而言，这次事件也是个提醒。两三百块钱的买课钱要是能买到改变命运的发财秘籍，这世上哪里还有穷人？理性消费，谨慎选择。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;还有那些“战略顾问”多到记不住的大企业，自家的名器应该珍惜。不想被人忽悠，也不要随便让人家拿出去忽悠别人。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;
