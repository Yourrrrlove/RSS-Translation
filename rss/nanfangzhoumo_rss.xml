This is the most significant revision of the Measures since it was promulgated in 1999 and individual provisions were modified in 2004. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;In recent years, individual companies have deliberately declared and used names illegally, disrupting the market order and causing great concern... Some deliberately &#39;similar to famous brands&#39;, deliberately counterfeiting the names, abbreviations, etc. of central and state-owned enterprises, infringing on the legality of well-known units Rights and interests.&quot; mentioned in the interpretation of the new regulations issued by the State Administration for Market Regulation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since 2021, the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of the State Council has announced three batches of lists of counterfeit central enterprises.

Connect with the enterprise name declaration system of the General Administration. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When an applicant declares a company name independently, the company name declaration system automatically compares the company name submitted by the applicant, and makes bans and restrictions based on the company name prohibition and restriction rules, identical and similar comparison rules, etc. Instructions or risk warnings. At the same time, the interconnected enterprise name declaration system can better compare enterprise names and effectively prevent the illegal registration of enterprise names by exploiting loopholes in cross-provincial information incompatibility. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;In the past, provinces and cities were not connected to each other. For example, if a central state-owned enterprise is registered in Province A, and you want to be associated with it in Province A, the system may screen it, but if it is in Province B or C Province, if you fake the background of a central state-owned enterprise in Province A, you may not be able to screen because you are not connected to the Internet.&quot; Han Shuai said that after being connected to the Internet, the authenticity, legality and validity of the materials submitted by the company can be more accurately reviewed. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Establish a random inspection system&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;, &lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;an administrative adjudication mechanism for name disputes&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;For existing counterfeit central For state-owned enterprises, the &quot;Implementation Measures&quot; also strengthened the supervision and management system, requiring the enterprise registration authority to find that the registered enterprise name does not comply with the relevant provisions of enterprise name registration management, it should make timely corrections in accordance with the law and order the enterprise to change its name. The enterprise registration authority at the higher level may correct the enterprise name that has been registered by the enterprise registration authority at the lower level and does not comply with the relevant provisions on enterprise name registration management. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, the State Administration for Market Regulation has established a spot inspection system to supervise and inspect the enterprise name registration management and enterprise name declaration services of provincial enterprise registration authorities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Han Shuai believes that the market supervision department regularly selects a certain proportion of company names for verification. It may be random, or it may be reported by relevant units or individuals. If it is found that there are counterfeit central state-owned enterprises and forged registration materials circumstances, they can be punished in accordance with the law and regulations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another highlight is that the &quot;Implementation Measures&quot; also improve the administrative adjudication mechanism for enterprise name disputes, clearly stipulate the considerations for dispute review, and refine the procedural provisions of the litigation process, including jurisdiction, application and the time limit and process for acceptance, dispute mediation mechanism, factors to be considered in review and processing, summary adjudication procedures, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Han Shuai introduced that there are usually three ways to protect the rights of central state-owned enterprises when they are counterfeited. In terms of administration, the first is to apply for the registration authority to make an administrative ruling; the second is to apply to the administrative authority to investigate and punish the unfair competition behavior of the infringing enterprise. At the judicial level, a lawsuit can be filed in the People&#39;s Court. The Civil Code of the People&#39;s Republic of China also has relevant provisions on the protection of corporate names. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Summary adjudication proceedings are now also possible. The &quot;Implementation Measures&quot; stipulate that for enterprise name disputes where the facts are clear, the dispute is not major, and the case is simple, the enterprise registration authority may apply summary adjudication procedures in accordance with relevant regulations. &quot;After the new regulations, how companies protect their rights has been designed more clearly, which improves administrative efficiency and helps companies resolve disputes.&quot; Han Shuai said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 15 Oct 2023 17:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[乾隆资助北美独立战争？封建帝王的眼界和见识不值得吹嘘]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258644]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-15 16:15:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Not long ago, a certain big V posted on Weibo saying: &quot;After the gunfire in Lexington, Emperor Qianlong should At the invitation of King Louis XVI of France, he funded the North American militia with 1,000 taels of gold... It turns out that the Qing Dynasty contributed a lot to the independence of the United States.&quot; In order to prove that what he said was true, the blogger also listed the sources of relevant historical materials: &quot;The Ministry of Internal Affairs Manufacturing Office File Volume 27. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Qianlong, who has always been regarded as a man of great achievements and self-proclaimed, actually had such &quot;far-sightedness&quot; as &quot;joining France to support the United States and resisting the British and barbarians&quot;. This anecdote aroused the interest of many netizens, and many believed it to be true. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, this seemingly novel story is actually a very low-level rumor. The blogger listed the words in the so-called letter from Emperor Qianlong to King Louis XVI of France in the comment area, &quot;Bederi &quot;Use money and get wet with rain and dew&quot;, and based on this, he categorically claimed that Qianlong did not use treasury funds, but chose to use private funds to fund the North American militia. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, this sentence comes from the second sentence in the &quot;Emperor Qianlong&#39;s Edict to King George III of England&quot;. The original text is: &quot;The products of the Celestial Empire are abundant and everything is available. Originally, they did not borrow goods from foreign countries. Whether there is anything or not. Especially because the tea, porcelain, and silk produced by the Chinese dynasty are indispensable to Western countries and your country, so I showed my kindness and sympathy and opened a foreign business in Macao to provide daily necessities and make a profit.&quot;&lt; /p>; &lt;p>;For a long time, this passage has been cited by historians to explain that Emperor Qianlong in his later years was closed-minded and short-sighted, and was ignorant of the drastic changes in the external world. It is completely ridiculous that such a paragraph was cut off by the blogger and placed on the head of King Louis XVI of France to prove that Emperor Qianlong was a far-sighted strategist with an international vision. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The reason why so many netizens believe this crude &quot;anecdote&quot; is not only because it is indeed a gimmick, but also because of the aura around Qianlong. So does this &quot;King of the Prosperous Age&quot; really have the kind of &quot;international vision&quot; that netizens believe? &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Grandfathers who are not far apart&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;During the Opium War, Emperor Daoguang ordered Yijing to interrogate British prisoners, and asked him a series of ridiculous questions. It became a joke in history:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;How far away is Kashmir (now Kashmir) from the country? Is there a waterway accessible? Does the country have any contact with the British? Why should we comply this time? To Zhejiang?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;How many places are around this country? How many are there in the country it belongs to? How many are the most powerful and independent of the country&#39;s rulers? Is there a dry road from Yingjia to Huijiang? Are there any exchanges? Is there a border with Russia? Is there any trade connection?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Obviously, Daoguang, who was devastated by the war, could not understand the concept of &quot;world colonial empire&quot; at all. Although the old and shabby intelligence network left to him by his emperor Ama and his grandfather was still working, the intelligence they continued to send from Kyaktu, Manila and Kashgar about the &quot;British barbarians&quot; not only failed Asking him to figure out who his enemies were made the emperor even more confused. He couldn&#39;t understand why &quot;British barbarians&quot; appeared in all directions of the Qing Empire at the same time, so he asked whether there were any enemies in Britain and Xinjiang. There are issues such as being connected by dry road and whether it borders Russia. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To be fair, these ridiculous questions asked by Emperor Daoguang are not worthy of ridicule. The vision and knowledge he displayed were only the normal level of the emperors of the Qing Dynasty. In terms of understanding the world as a whole, he is certainly not better than his father and grandfather, but he is not far behind. Because the system through which they receive education and the channels through which they perceive the outside world are essentially the same. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If the world is changing too fast, the concept of &quot;the empire on which the sun never sets&quot; is indeed a bit &quot;over the top&quot; for Emperor Daoguang. So Emperor Qianlong couldn&#39;t figure out where the two cities of Nerchinsk and Yaksa in the &quot;Treaty of Nerchinsk&quot; were, and whether they belonged to the Qing Dynasty or Russia. This only shows that the &quot;international vision&quot; of his grandfather and grandson was not far from each other. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the fifty-seventh year of Qianlong&#39;s reign (1792), Emperor Qianlong ordered a letter to the then Heilongjiang General Mingliang: &quot;During the Kangxi Dynasty, in order to capture the cities of Yaksa and Nerchinsk, they fought with Russia for several years. The two cities are there. But are these two cities now under the jurisdiction of Heilongjiang? If they are under the jurisdiction of Heilongjiang, who will manage them and who will be stationed there? Send a message to the general and others so that Russia will not notice, quietly find out, and take advantage of Please do not make any announcement. Please accept this. Send a letter in compliance with the order.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Treaty of Nerchinsk&quot; was the first diplomatic treaty signed by the Qing Dynasty within the framework of the Westphalian order. , was also the first time the Qing Dynasty came into contact with the modern international diplomatic system. The treaty not only delineated the national boundaries between China and Russia in the east, but also demarcated the spheres of influence of China and Russia in Northeast Asia. It can be said that the signing of the Treaty of Nerchinsk was a crucial event in establishing the basic territory of the Qing Dynasty. However, a hundred years later, the supreme ruler had no idea where Nerchinsk and Yaksa were. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What’s even more interesting is that Emperor Qianlong’s idea of ​​​​solving this problem was not to retrieve the text of the Treaty of Nerchinsk for review, but to ask the Heilongjiang generals, and the Heilongjiang generals also discussed with Emperor Qianlong Likewise, he was completely confused about the location of Nerchinsk and Yaksa. Similarly, he did not check the treaty, but &quot;ordered people to check&quot; and reported to Qianlong. It can be seen that the emperor and his ministers did not take this crucial international treaty seriously. To them, the Battle of Yaksa was just a border conflict where &quot;foreigners were looking for trouble.&quot; The signing of the treaty was just a means to solve this minor trouble. It was not a code of conduct for the Qing Dynasty in diplomacy, and once the troubles were resolved, the treaty was shelved and completely forgotten over time. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The established national policy of &quot;preventing internal affairs and financing external affairs&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;This kind of indifference and ignorance of the outside world by the Qing monarchs and ministers actually came from the political tradition and political tradition of the ancient autocratic emperors of &quot;preventing internal affairs and financing external affairs&quot; With established national policies, they always believed that the source of their core interests was not outside the empire, but that factors that could threaten and shake their rule were within the empire. Foreigners come from afar, and even if they are tyrannical for a while, in the final analysis they are people without roots. As long as they win over them from the massive benefits obtained from squeezing their own people, they will be able to live in peace. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the contrary, it is entirely possible for the nationals of this country to repeat their path to power and threaten their rule. This kind of political tradition and established decision-making determines that the attention of autocratic kings, including the emperors of the Qing Dynasty, is always inward and not outward. Therefore, when some of them, such as Emperors Kangxi and Qianlong, occasionally became interested in some &quot;strange skills and tricks&quot; in the outside world, it was only as personal hobbies and pastimes. These hobbies and pastimes could neither change their views on The way they perceive the world makes it even less likely that they will have an &quot;international perspective.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The most typical example is that during the Qianlong period, Zheng Xin, a Chinese military leader in Southeast Asia, seized power in Siam during the war and requested for canonization from the Qing Dynasty. From an international political perspective, this was a An excellent strategic opportunity, the Qing Dynasty may gain a firm and reliable ally and strategic fulcrum in Southeast Asia, and once and for all eliminate the threat from Myanmar to the Qing Dynasty&#39;s southern border. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, Emperor Qianlong&#39;s response to this opportunity was: &quot;(Zheng Xinhe) The king of Siam should be a monarch and his ministers. Now that the country is in ruins and people are perishing, they dare to take advantage of the crisis and no longer care about it. Therefore, he asked his descendants to restore the country and take revenge, and he often thought of self-reliance, and he wanted to grant the imperial edict in vain, thinking that it was a great contract, but it was actually an act that violated the rules and violated the rules.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Obviously, Zheng Xin&#39;s act of taking advantage of the chaos and seizing power in Siam as a courtier reminded Emperor Qianlong of the story of the founder of the Qing Dynasty who took advantage of the chaos and robbed the world as a courtier of the Ming Dynasty. He was worried that accepting Zheng Xin&#39;s regime would threaten the Qing Dynasty. The legitimacy of the founding of the country thus gave rise to feelings of disgust and rejection. It can be seen that the thinking mode of an autocratic emperor always comes first to consolidate his rule internally. In this case, how can there be any talk of &quot;international vision&quot;? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Earlier in the fifth year of Qianlong (1740), the Nanyang Chinese who had been oppressed by the Dutch colonists rose up in Indonesia to resist and were massacred by the Dutch colonists on the banks of the Red Creek outside Batavia. Nearly 10,000 overseas Chinese died. After some discussions between the Qing emperors and ministers, they came to the conclusion that &quot;(the Chinese who were killed) were originally native to that place and were no different from the Ban people.&quot; Emperor Qianlong finally approved the disposal plan that &quot;the Bans in Nanyang are still allowed to trade as usual.&quot; Nothing happened and no sanctions of any kind were imposed on the Dutch colonists. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The above historical facts show that what makes an autocratic king truly superb is his internal skills of protecting, governing, weakening and exhausting the people. To brag about the vision and knowledge of an autocratic king is obviously a lie. It would be even more stupid to misdirect their efforts and spread rumors. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 15 Oct 2023 16:55:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[复旦人体科学馆馆长：与标本“交谈”，让人体不再神秘]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258640]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-15 15:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/15/XcjddVb9DUbrdQ7P2UiaoVzt3pUZ4emkQcuY9TuQ.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1269&quot; height=&quot;952&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/15/XcjddVb9DUbrdQ7P2UiaoVzt3pUZ4emkQ cuY9TuQ. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254082&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Zhou Guomin often personally introduces visitors, and volunteers do so when he is in class or out. Visitors explain. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern Weekend reporter Huang Sizhuo/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A human science museum hidden in the Fenglin Campus of Fudan University has become popular. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Many people came here after reading Xiaohongshu and Dianping. Everyone is curious about how a place displaying human specimens has become a &#39;niche check-in place&#39; and an &#39;Internet celebrity museum&#39;.&quot; In order to Not to miss every consultation call, director Zhou Guomin specially bound the landline of the science museum to his mobile phone number. Therefore, Zhou Guomin&#39;s mobile phone almost never stopped ringing throughout the National Day holiday. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What few visitors know is that being the curator of the Human Science Museum is just one of Zhou Guomin’s many jobs. He served as the head of the Department of Anatomy and Histoembryology at Fudan University School of Basic Medicine for nearly two decades. , and will also be responsible for more than 20 class hours/week teaching tasks at the beginning of the fall semester of 2023. He also has many anatomy-related positions and titles outside the school. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“This year is my tenth year at the Human Body Science Museum. I also want to do a better job in popularizing science and discover more stories so that ordinary people can feel the warmth of medicine.” Zhou Guomin said to the South reporters said over the weekend. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The following is compiled based on the dictation of Professor Zhou Guomin:&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;&lt;/strong>;Tell children how new life is born&lt;strong>;&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/ h4>; &lt;p>;Although the Human Science Museum is small, it has a long history and a rich collection, such as tissue sections labeled with Yenching University, a micromanipulator produced in Germany in 1930, a complete skeleton and whole-body plastinated specimens. But the most conspicuous place upon entering is the baby specimen. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1944, Professor Yan Fuqing’s daughter-in-law gave birth to a pair of twin baby girls, who died due to premature birth. For a long time, Chinese people have believed that &quot;the deceased is the most important&quot; and there are few body donors. However, Yan Fuqing selflessly donated the bodies of his relatives to medical research. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/15/aruBfaepCDnnJMJ5gjgYQiBs6u5QTNFXISupbcvd.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1269&quot; height= &quot;952&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/15/aruBfaepCDnnJMJ5gjgYQiBs6u5QTNFXISupbcvd.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254081&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On October 9, 2023, Zhou Guomin introduced the specimens of twin baby girls to visitors and the story behind the specimens. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern Weekend reporter Huang Sizhuo/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yan Fuqing is the former National Shanghai Medical College (the predecessor of Fudan University Shanghai Medical College) and the Chinese Medical Association The founder of the company is known as the &quot;Father of Modern Chinese Medicine&quot;. For nearly eighty years, these baby girls have been studied and admired by generations of medical students, and are now placed where they can be seen at first sight when entering the museum. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yan Fuqing’s grandson Yan Zhiyuan is also studying and working in medicine. Similar to his sister, he is also a twin, but his brother unfortunately died at birth. In order to fulfill his grandfather&#39;s last wish, Yan Zhiyuan decided to donate his body to his alma mater for autopsy after his death. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are also some baby specimens in the Human Science Museum with brain malformations, which are very distressing to see. This was actually because some pregnant women at that time lacked necessary vitamins, resulting in poor fetal brain development. Later, after folic acid supplementation was advocated, the incidence of fetal brain malformations was greatly reduced. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Most of the people who visit the Human Body Science Museum are parents who bring their children to learn about human body science. I like to tell children how new life is born, starting with the production of sperm and eggs. Every child is a champion, healthy, strong, hard-working, living in the dream palace provided by his mother, and comes into this world with love and hope. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many doctors are working hard for the birth of new life. If any of these interested children are willing to engage in medicine in the future, I will be even happier. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Both an &quot;alumni&quot; and a &quot;mentor&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Every time a visitor comes, I want to ask them where they come from and why they think of it. Gotta visit this place. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the one hand, Shanghai’s museum resources are really rich, and the name of the Human Body Science Museum seems a bit scary at first glance, but they come all the way here and have to make an appointment to enter the school, which is more cumbersome; On the one hand, I am also looking for potential connections between visitors and this pavilion. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among the visitors, some are engaged in medical-related work themselves, some have relatives who are ill and are seeking treatment in nearby hospitals, and they come to visit and study while accompanying them, and some want to learn about body donation. A visitor surnamed Wu once added me on WeChat to learn how to donate a body to his seriously ill mother, which was her mother’s wish. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Everyone who studies medicine knows that without corpses, there would be no anatomy, and without anatomy, there would be no modern medicine. Without visible and tangible human specimens, it would be difficult for medical schools to train excellent doctors. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So we are full of respect for body donors and call them body teachers. These general teachers are both our &quot;alumni&quot; and &quot;mentors&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In recent years, I have been collecting older body donation certificates. There are many application and volunteer forms from the 1980s and 1990s taped to one wall in the museum.

There were no telephones at that time. Now can I find the relatives of these early donors and express my gratitude to the doctors? If their family members knew that the name of Teacher Da Ti had been engraved on the monument in Fushou Garden in Shanghai, would they want to pay homage to the deceased and tell them about the pain of separation for thirty or forty years? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I have found one, and I hope to find more in the future and record the story of Teacher DaTi. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Science popularization should also be innovative and interesting&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;For many people, the body is like a blind box. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The onset of the COVID-19 epidemic has made everyone more concerned about their health and more willing to understand their bodies. For example, people know that infection with pneumonia may lead to &quot;white lungs.&quot; Look at the male anatomy teacher in the corner. His lungs are black and gray. This &quot;black lung&quot; is caused by smoking. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fudan University has always had a tradition of attaching importance to science popularization. In 2013, the school allocated millions of yuan in special funds to carry out large-scale reconstruction and upgrade of the two original exhibition halls (referring to the Human Science Museum and the Pathological Specimen Museum, founded in the 1930s). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The so-called collections and treasures of the museum are of course important, but I care more about everyone’s experience of coming to this exhibition hall. In addition to various microscopes, we also introduced VR, 3D printing, digital human systems and other equipment to enhance the sense of technology and interactive experience. Some children lingered and came several times. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to popularize science more interestingly, we have also engaged in several cross-border cooperations. Currently going on is &quot;Open Your Blind Box - Human Anatomy Art Exhibition&quot;, where the creators combine medicine and art. After the opening, the number of visitors who made reservations online increased significantly, and some people came specifically for this purpose. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/15/n9Kvb9iJFI4HrfBABGoZDm5i6mOZaYDDAwc40BVW.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1269&quot; height= &quot;952&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/15/n9Kvb9iJFI4HrfBABGoZDm5i6mOZaYDDAwc40BVW.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254083&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In April 2023, the &quot;Open Your Blind Box - Human Anatomy Art Exhibition&quot; at the Human Science Museum of Fudan University officially opened. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern Weekend reporter Huang Sizhuo/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Imagine painting each bone with colorful patterns such as giraffes and Garden of Eden. A blood vessel or nerve can have different colors. Each specimen is sketched with a black pen to form a volume of pictures. At this moment, the human body becomes no longer mysterious and becomes more exciting. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I believe that the same object and the observation perspectives of different disciplines and fields will bring different discoveries and experiences. Art is the constant experimentation and innovation of viewing angles. More importantly, art can give people the courage to observe from conventional angles. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 15 Oct 2023 15:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[旋转的白森林]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258574]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-15 14:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/11/CDGLWAR98C8pWtIuxfWnkE9P6QN98wHniNqZbJhv.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;357&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/CDGLWAR98C8pWtIuxfWnkE9P6QN98wHniN qZbJhv. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253666&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Grassland Sky Road Observation Deck&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>; (Southern People Weekly reporter Jiang Xiaoming/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;All things are one and connected to each other. The signs appear, but their meaning is difficult to decipher. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I spent the whole morning roaming in the wilderness. On the rolling hills, oats and sunflowers sway in the wind, waiting to be harvested. Autumn has come to Zhangbei grassland again. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Under a cement pole, I took off my backpack and sat down to rest. It&#39;s quiet around here. Occasionally a car would pass by silently on the road in the distance. Listen carefully to the hum of wind turbines grinding the air. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The number &quot;76&quot; is affixed to the pole. This number has special meaning to me - the birthday of a close relative. A few black feathers and a dried neck bone were scattered on the grass. Seven years ago today, I was driving her on the highway and killed a magpie. The night before, she slept in an orchard near the China-North Korea border and had a nightmare - an eye stared at her in the night sky. After waking up, she heard a woman crying all night on the mountain - an eagle owl was crying. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/2R802a1KiPtLOBbZJKzTQcIEW7CBNMyaP8HyiAaN.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;362&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/2R802a1KiPtLOBbZJKzTQcIEW7CBNMyaP8HyiAaN.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253667&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Mature sunflowers&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern People Weekly reporter Jiang Xiaoming/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Under the hill Opera and the sound of tractors came from the villages. I looked away from the feathers. The village square became a threshing floor, and shelled oats were spread on the cement floor like kraft paper. Oat likes cold, is drought-tolerant, and is resistant to salt and alkali. It has been cultivated by Guansai border people since ancient times. It is easy to feel full after eating and difficult to digest. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the afternoon, I passed a poplar forest and faintly smelled the scent of sheep. There are a group of sheep in the forest, heads gathering together, as if they are performing some kind of silent ceremony. I sneaked into the woods quietly, fearing to disturb them. Unexpectedly, the owner of the sheep suddenly appeared and startled me. A woman wearing pink sneakers holds a mobile phone and a whip in her hands, and a baseball cap on her head is embroidered with the Chanel logo. I asked her what the sheep were doing together, and she said they didn&#39;t like to move when they were full. I said: There are thirty of them, right? She said there were more than seventy of them, clustered in a pile so they couldn’t be counted. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;White impeller, circular pointer.

He was old and walked slowly. He was leaning on a dead branch in his left hand and holding a ewe in his right hand. The ewe has a stubborn character and keeps wrestling with the old man, trying to break free. The reins connecting them are stretched straight. The old man told me that he went to his daughter&#39;s house in a neighboring village to tend sheep early in the morning. The ewe was two years old and had given birth to two litters of two lambs. One lamb was sold for six hundred. The ewe seemed to be eavesdropping on our conversation, nibbling on the sunflower trays on the roadside and looking at us sideways with her yellow eyes. The old man tightened the reins again and made another circle in his hand. He wore several layers of clothes, and his red baseball cap was embroidered with the logo - ×× Fertilizer. &quot;It will take an hour until we get home,&quot; he put the tip of his tongue against his sunken lips, with a hint of complaint in his tone, &quot;I forgot to put on my dentures when I went out, and my daughter stayed to eat...&quot; I glanced at his dark mouth, with only the lower gums remaining. A loose crooked tooth is like a stone monument in the dark night.

Not long after driving out of Zhangbei County, I couldn&#39;t wait to leave the main road and drove toward the distant hills, dragging the yellow dust cloud behind the car. Went around several old elm trees covered with moss, turned two turns, and finally reached a plateau. A van was parked next to a wheat field, with black film on the windows and half-open side windshield of the cab, without a driver. The view here is wide and unobstructed: countless white windmills are spinning lazily; harvesters are raising puffs of dust and smoke in the wheat fields; a box of &quot;Gatling&quot; fireworks tubes are lying quietly on the grass after being discharged. Accompanying them are drink bottles, cigarette boxes, grocery bags and tissues with lip gloss stuck on them. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The van started suddenly, turned around suddenly, and drove towards the road at an unusual speed. After the van drove away, I noticed that there was a commanding point on the high ground - a hill covered with grass. The hills are surrounded by wheat fields. I stepped over the wheat stubble and patrolled around the mountains. The locusts in the fields were flying like shrapnel. This is an &quot;artificial mountain&quot; about 4 meters high and nearly 8 meters in diameter. The moment I climbed to the top of the mountain, I was glad I stopped in time. There is a hole the size of a wellhead in the middle of the top of the mountain. The entrance of the cave is circular, and the cave wall gradually becomes a trapezoid as it goes down. When it is close to the ground, the tunnel turns into a side cave. The hole was dug cleanly, with no residual soil around it. The entrance of the cave is like an open mouth, shouting silently towards the sky. I turned up my collar and carefully walked down the hill. A civet cat scurried past me with a black bird in its mouth. I was stunned for a moment, then quickly got into the car and drove towards the highway at the speed of a van. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/osadEbuMuW9R6LvoBjVXPvXnJtI0VJm4orM1Oa9j.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;359&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/osadEbuMuW9R6LvoBjVXPvXnJtI0VJm4orM1Oa9j.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253669&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Villers drying oats&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern People Weekly reporter Jiang Xiaoming/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Two Soldiers were running cross-country on the road.

They lower their heads in the forest, pick mushrooms, and shoot videos; groups of well-fed Dauri jackdaws sit on the roadside wires, chattering and quarreling.

Some villa owners claim that this green space is the &quot;backyard&quot; listed on the property certificate. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since 2018, Lu Caiyun and other shop owners have repeatedly complained to Hefei City Letters and Calls Bureau, Housing and Urban-Rural Development Bureau, High-tech Zone Management Committee, High-tech Zone Shulu Community Service Center and other departments. Until 2022, the Hefei Real Estate Registration Center admitted that the contents of the real estate certificates of villa owners were incorrect and needed to be updated. In May 2023, the mayor&#39;s mailbox replied that the Hefei Municipal Natural Resources and Planning Bureau had identified the &quot;backyard&quot; as an illegal construction in accordance with the law.

In 2016, Lu Caiyun purchased a street shop in the community and opened a Chinese restaurant. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to her recollection, after the shop was delivered, she installed the outdoor air conditioner on the south wall near the villa in accordance with the property management requirements. At that time, no one was living in the villa behind the south wall. The area between the two was planted with green plants and there was a stone road for people to pass. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2018, due to a malfunction of the air conditioner in the store, maintenance personnel needed to repair the outdoor unit of the air conditioner. At this time, the area between the shop and the villa has become the private garden of the villa area, and the south wall of the shop has become the &quot;wall&quot; of the garden. With the coordination of neighborhood committee staff, Lu Caiyun was able to enter her neighbor&#39;s &quot;garden&quot; to repair the air conditioner. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lu Caiyun is not the only one who has disputes with the owners of villas because of the open space behind the shop. As early as 2018, some shop owners discovered that the vacant land had been turned into villa courtyards, and the east and west sides were blocked by walls, which seriously affected the use of the shops. They sued the developer Xuhui Group Co., Ltd., demanding that the 7-meter-wide space behind the shops be restored. Public land. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The shop owners lost both cases. However, according to the second-instance judgment (2019) Anhui 01 Minzhong No. 4059, the evidence provided by the shop owners in the second-instance trial showed that the open space between the shops and the villa area was green space. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Basic Terminology Standards for Urban Planning&quot; formulated by the Ministry of Construction (later changed to the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development) states that green spaces refer to urban areas specifically used to improve ecology, protect the environment, and provide recreational areas for residents. and landscaping landscaping. The developer recognized this and stated that the actual construction was also constructed in accordance with the requirements of the green space. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The general layout plan of the Xuhui Lake Shanyuan Project approved by the Hefei Municipal Natural Resources and Planning Bureau provided by Lu Caiyun can also support this point. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The plan map shows that there is a passage between the S5 commercial area where the shops are located and the villa area. There are clearly illustrations of multiple plants on the map, indicating that this is a green space in the residential area. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Article 274 of the Civil Code stipulates that green spaces within building zones belong to the owners, except those that belong to urban public green spaces or that are expressly owned by individuals. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Encyclopedia of Applications of the Chinese Civil Code (Property Rights Volume)&quot; compiled by the Leading Group for the Implementation of the Civil Code of the Supreme People&#39;s Court further explains: Roads and green spaces within building zones are usually owned by the owners. According to the legal theory of divided ownership of buildings, the roads and green spaces within the building zone belong to the common supporting facilities in the common property of the community. Under special circumstances, certain roads and green spaces within the building zone are not shared by the owners. As for the green space that is expressly owned by individuals, it mostly refers to the green space in front of the window of a first-floor building unit or the green space in a specific area adjacent to the building, and this part of the green space needs to be clearly sold together with the exclusive part of the building in the commercial housing sales contract. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this case, the originally planned green space was divided into courtyards. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since May 2018, 25 shop owners, including Lu Caiyun, have repeatedly reported to the Hefei High-tech Zone Shulu Community Service Center, the High-tech Zone Management Committee, the Hefei Municipal Housing and Urban-Rural Development Bureau, and the Municipal Government. The Complaints Bureau, the Mayor&#39;s Mailbox and other departments reported that the owners of more than 20 villas in Buildings C55, C56 and C57 had occupied green space (8 households in one building) and set up private basements. Some of the problems were solved, but there has been no substantial progress in the encroachment of green space. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Local media reported that the owner of the villa produced a property certificate, which stated that the land was indeed his backyard. Southern Weekend reporters were unable to contact the owner of the villa. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Multiple consultations failed&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In August 2021, the then Party Secretary of Shulu Community Service Center in Hefei High-tech Zone was interviewed by local official media It said that Lu Caiyun submitted materials to the community on June 9, 2020, reflecting the problem of encroachment on public areas. After receiving the report, community staff went to the developer’s Shanghai headquarters to interview him and required the developer to respond within 3 months. Areas related to public access were set back, and the developer also signed a letter of commitment in this regard. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Three months later, because the developer failed to fulfill its concession promise, the community and urban management bureau planned to demolish the illegal building in the villa. However, the owner of the villa showed the property certificate on the spot, which contained the word &quot;backyard&quot;. area. Out of respect for legal and valid documents, the community temporarily suspended the demolition. At the same time, the Hefei Municipal Party Committee inspection team present was also aware of the situation and stated that it would investigate issues related to the real estate certificate. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Because the problem could not be resolved, Lu Caiyun and others complained to the Anhui Provincial Letters and Calls Bureau in November 2021, requesting to find out why the green space was registered in the property certificates of more than 20 villa owners. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On November 22 of that year, the Anhui Provincial Letters and Calls Bureau stated in a return visit that the Hefei Real Estate Registration Department had teamed up with relevant departments to investigate and verify the marking of the community’s personal property rights certificates, and was currently studying and handling opinions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On March 16, 2022, the Hefei Real Estate Registration Center also issued an announcement requiring the owner of the villa involved to correct the real estate certificate. The announcement stated that according to Article 81 of the &quot;Implementing Rules of the Interim Regulations on Real Estate Registration&quot;, because the owners of Buildings C55, C56 and C57 of Hushan Yuanzuo Community have incorrect content in the real estate certificates, they need to wait until they receive the notice. Change the registration and renew the real estate certificate within 30 working days. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But the fact that the green space is occupied has not changed. On May 9, 2023, Lu Caiyun once again reported the situation to the mayor of Hefei’s mailbox. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On May 23, the Hefei Real Estate Registration Center responded, saying that based on the previous request of city leaders during the interview, the High-tech Zone Management Committee organized an inspection of Buildings C55 and C56 of Xuhui Lake Shanyuan Building. An investigation into illegal construction was launched in the north yard of Building C and Building C57. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among them, in response to the illegal construction of fences that encroach on public green space and other issues, the Urban Management Bureau of the High-tech Zone has submitted investigation materials on the illegal construction of fences in some buildings to the Hefei Municipal Natural Resources and Planning Bureau for identification of illegal construction. , Hefei Municipal Natural Resources and Planning Bureau has determined it to be an illegal construction in accordance with the law, and the High-tech Zone Urban Management Bureau is handling it in accordance with the law. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lu Caiyun said that they still don’t know the handling of the property certificates that were previously registered incorrectly, and there are no signs that the villa owner’s garden will be demolished. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend contacted Hefei Municipal Natural Resources and Planning Bureau and Hefei Real Estate Registration Center many times, but received no positive response. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On September 26, 2023, a reporter from Southern Weekend contacted Linxi Community of Shulu Community Service Center. The staff informed, “The community and self-regulatory bureau, the real estate registration center and the villa owners have negotiated many times to no avail, and it is difficult to Promote the demolition of illegal constructions.&quot; In addition, according to his understanding, the property certificate of the villa owner has been corrected. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, Southern Weekend reporters checked the relevant regulations and found no clause that requires the consent of the illegal builders to demolish illegal buildings. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 7, 2023, a reporter from Southern Weekend contacted the Urban Management Squadron of Shulu Center of Hefei High-tech Zone. The staff said that they were already going through law enforcement procedures against the courtyard walls built privately by the villa owners. “Previously, Use drones to take photos and collect evidence, and after the planning department approves it, the parties will be allowed to dismantle it by themselves within a time limit.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 15 Oct 2023 13:25:07 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[巴以冲突又起，中东“和解大潮”难再续？丨智库视点]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258634]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-15 11:50:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;In the early morning of October 7, 2023, local time, the Palestinian Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) launched an attack on Israel in recent years. The Israeli Defense Forces launched the largest rocket attack in the country and sent a large number of militants into southern Israel, where they broke into street battles with Israeli security forces. The Israel Defense Forces quickly launched a counterattack and launched a &quot;comprehensive siege&quot; of Gaza. The situation between Palestine and Israel suddenly escalated. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Palestinian-Israeli conflict has aroused widespread attention and concern from the international community due to its sudden outbreak and the huge casualties it caused. It is in sharp contrast to the &quot;reconciliation trend&quot; in the Middle East this year. It reveals the complexity and variability of the Middle East issue. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;The intensity of the conflict is limited&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Compared with the past, this round of conflicts has more obvious high-intensity characteristics, as well as the amplification effect of war news in the Internet era, causing This has aroused people&#39;s concerns about whether the sixth Middle East war will break out, but at present, it is highly likely that the scope of this round of conflict will be limited to Hamas and Israel. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Specifically, Arab countries such as Egypt and Jordan surrounding Palestine do not have sufficient motivation or reason to go to war with Israel. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since 2022, Egypt’s economy has continued to slump due to the spillover effects of the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Exporting natural gas to Europe through the Arab Gas Pipeline and Israel’s Leviathan Gas Field has become an important channel for earning foreign exchange income. At this time, if Egypt is at odds with Israel, its economic development will undoubtedly fall into huge difficulties; Syria, in the north of Pakistan, is in jail, and its limited resources will also be prioritized for domestic economic reconstruction; Lebanon is experiencing a severe economic and financial crisis, and there is no are willing to participate in the war; Gulf Arab countries with strong economic and military strength should only provide moral support and humanitarian assistance to Palestine as long as their core interests are not affected; Fatah, which represents the legitimate Palestinian regime, chooses I watched from the sidelines. Therefore, without the actual participation of other sovereign states, this round of conflict will eventually return to become a stage in the spiral evolution of Palestinian-Israeli relations. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Infinite Vicious Circle&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The conflict between Israel and Palestine continues. To be precise, it is a confrontation with the radical factions dominated by Hamas. It is the inevitable result of the long-term deterioration of the relationship between the two parties, and the explosive manifestation of crossing the critical point. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In recent years, surrounding issues such as Palestine&#39;s pursuit of statehood, the &quot;legalization&quot; of Jewish settlements, and the competition for holy sites, the tense situation between Palestine and Israel has never changed, and has even become more intense. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since January 2023, the conflict between Palestine and Israel in Jerusalem has continued to intensify. The Israeli military and police have repeatedly forcibly expelled Palestinian residents near the Al-Aqsa Mosque; in early July, the Israeli military carried out A large-scale military operation was launched in the Jenin region, causing a large number of casualties and displacement of Palestinians. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Radical factions such as Hamas and Jihad, which firmly advocate armed struggle, continue to promote the spread and expansion of their political and military power, causing the Palestinian-Israeli relationship to gradually deepen into an infinite vicious cycle of &quot;reacting violence with violence&quot; , and laid hidden dangers for larger-scale conflicts and crises that may occur in the future. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Against the background of extremely disparity in power between the two sides, the living space of the Palestinian people has been continuously compressed. The Gaza Strip has been under strict blockade and surveillance by the Israeli military for a long time, and the population density has reached approximately 10,000 people per square meter. kilometer. According to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) statistical report, 57% of households in the Gaza Strip have experienced a significant decrease in income in 2022, the local unemployment rate has increased by 49%, and 65% of the population is in poverty. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The continued economic downturn has brought infrastructure construction in the Gaza Strip to almost a standstill. When former United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon visited Gaza, he said that Israel&#39;s policy of blocking Gaza was &quot;unacceptable.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As the relations between Arab countries and Israel have become increasingly easing, especially the recent continuous exchanges between Saudi Arabia and Israel, and the possibility of even reaching a peace agreement, the Palestinians&#39; insecurity has been infinitely magnified. As the Palestinian issue becomes increasingly marginalized, the Palestinians have no choice but to rely on their own strength to survive. At the same time, the continued inaction of the Palestinian Authority, which legally represents Palestinian sovereignty, has actually created more public support for Hamas within Palestine, making it a &quot;firm defender&quot; of Palestinian national consciousness. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From this point of view, the current conflict between Pakistan and Israel is also the product of the collision between long-term conflicts that have not been resolved and changes in the game situation inside and outside the region. In fact, the Palestinian-Israeli conflict has been experiencing cyclical ups and downs since its existence, which makes it almost impossible to achieve a lasting and fair solution. The call for national self-determination and the restoration of legitimate rights and interests has been circulated among generations of Palestinians. As Israel&#39;s &quot;most right-wing government&quot; comes to power, the way Israel and Palestinian radical factions get along will also be full of violence and hatred. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Highly complex&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In the short term, this round of Palestinian-Israeli conflict will still have a greater impact on peace and stability in the Eastern Mediterranean, and at the same time promote The game relationship between the various forces has undergone a series of changes. It is worth noting that the various conflicts in the region and the intricate interest relationships between countries determine the impact of this incident on the Middle East and even the world, and will not be presented in a simple linear rise or fall. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First of all, the reconciliation process between the Arab-Islamic world and Israel will enter a state of suspension or even regression in the short term. On October 10, local time, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman said when answering a call from Palestinian President Abbas that Saudi Arabia will continue to support the Palestinians in realizing their legitimate rights, which means that the Saudi-Israeli reconciliation process has attracted much attention. It has been &quot;temporarily terminated&quot;; as Iran announced its support for Hamas&#39;s actions in Israel, its relations with Israel will also fall &quot;below the freezing point&quot;. Although Turkey will actively play the role of mediator between Israel and Palestinian forces , but it is almost impossible for its relationship with Israel to return to its original state. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Secondly, the reconciliation process within the Arab world will be accelerated, and Palestinian affairs may become the glue to curb the &quot;fragmentation&quot; of the Arab world. In the past few months, as the crisis of Qatar&#39;s severance of diplomatic relations has been completely resolved, and Syria has returned to the Arab League family, there is a glimmer of an end to the divisions and internal strife that have lasted for more than ten years in the Arab world after the &quot;Arab Spring&quot;. Under this situation, the Arab world&#39;s political sympathy for Palestine will further promote the ill-fated Arab countries to unite and strengthen themselves, and give them the spiritual motivation to achieve true strategic independence. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Third, the main contradictions in the Middle East may change. In the past few decades, the contradictions between Arab Islamic countries and Israel, the contradictions between Sunni and Shia forces, and the contradictions between regional countries and external interference forces have intertwined and superimposed, thus shaping the current geopolitical pattern of the Middle East— —Changes in the structural proportions of any set of contradictions will rewrite the geopolitical demands of the relevant forces. Against the dual background of the Saudi-Iranian reconciliation and the continued strategic contraction of the United States in the Middle East, this round of Palestinian-Israeli conflict will undoubtedly further highlight the contradictions between Arab Islamic countries and Israel, resulting in a series of chain reactions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Returning to the conflict itself, whether it is Hamas armed raids on Israeli targets or Israel&#39;s violent counterattacks with revenge, it has caused huge casualties and economic and property losses to both sides - a large number of Israeli hostages Being hijacked by Hamas affects the nervousness of Israeli residents. At the same time, the Gaza Strip&#39;s only power plant ceased operations due to Israeli bombing and siege, which also means that despair will spread to every street in the area. However, hatred and violence can never fundamentally solve the problem. It is difficult for both Palestine and Israel to make concessions to each other on issues involving their core interests. The Palestine-Israel issue may become even more difficult in the future. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(The author is an associate researcher at the Economic, Trade and Industry Investment Research Center of the Mediterranean Research Institute of Zhejiang International Studies University)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/ p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 15 Oct 2023 11:55:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[中国籍女子在新加坡被控罪：入乡应随法，别搞“舆论化妆师”那一套丨快评]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258632]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-15 10:47:05&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;According to Singapore&#39;s &quot;Lianhe Zaobao&quot; report, a Chinese woman was suspected of being hit by a driver and injured her foot. While receiving medical treatment at the Central Hospital, he allegedly insulted a nurse and refused to cooperate with the police in taking a statement. In addition, he was suspected of verbally abusing a security guard earlier. He was charged with six counts, including one count of public nuisance, two counts of contravening the Prevention of Harassment Act, and three counts. One count of contravening the Private Security Industry Act. If convicted, the woman involved may face a penalty of &quot;a fine of up to 7,500 yuan, or imprisonment of up to two years, or both.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The matter is not complicated and the facts are clear. In the early morning of October 10, the woman involved went to the emergency room of Singapore General Hospital (SGH) to seek medical treatment. She said that she was hit by a substitute driver and requested rapid treatment. The medical staff noticed that she was not wearing a mask, so they handed it to her and reminded her that she must wear a mask in the hospital. Not only did the woman refuse to cooperate, she cursed and insulted the nurse, complaining that she had &quot;waited for three hours.&quot; The hospital had no choice but to call the police, who sent police officers and investigators to the hospital to investigate. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Judging from the video released by the woman involved, she not only refused to cooperate in recording a confession and let the investigator &quot;guess&quot;, but also changed the topic many times, accusing the nurse of discriminating against her, and also swore at the investigator. , and tried to pull the ID of an investigator, but was firmly stopped by the latter. According to an announcement from the Singapore police, the woman in question even had a criminal record. On October 3, she was drunk, pushed and pulled the security guard who sent her home, and used insulting and abusive language. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The prosecution pointed out in court on October 13 that if the defendant intends to plead guilty, they will conduct a trial on four of the charges, and the remaining two charges will be taken into consideration by the judge when sentencing. The defendant directly said, &quot;I plead guilty and I apologize.&quot; When the judge asked the defendant whether he would hire a lawyer, the defendant asked if he could get a lighter sentence by pleading guilty early without hiring a lawyer. The judge explained that pleading guilty early would help mitigate the crime. The defendant expressed his understanding, and the judge postponed the case to October 25 and approved her bail of 15,000 Singapore dollars. In addition to the bail, a Singaporean citizen was required to vouch for her. From the news, it seemed that no one came forward to vouch for her, but she was taken back to the police station&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This case seemed to be a trivial matter, but it turned out to be more and more troublesome. Not only are the legal consequences extremely serious, but the public opinion effect can also be called &quot;full of influence&quot;. After carefully examining the timeline of this case from the incident to the aftermath, the words and deeds of the woman involved are a living lesson in the rule of law, worthy of analysis and analysis. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First, the words and deeds of the woman involved during the incident may have been &quot;scripted&quot; in advance, but they hit a brick wall. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The woman in question refused to obey hospital regulations, did not wear a mask, and was impatient to wait for medical treatment. This is all true; shouting obscenities at the nurse was her intention to vent and engage in emotional blackmail. ; When facing investigators, she denied and insisted that &quot;the nurse discriminated against her&quot;, hoping to &quot;preemptively draw a portrait&quot; to take the initiative in public opinion; recording the video and publishing it on social media was also intended to launch a public opinion offensive to influence the judiciary and escape punishment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the investigator acted strictly in accordance with the law and stated that the trip was only to investigate &quot;whether the woman in question swore at the nurse.&quot; At the same time, the investigator warned the woman in question three times not to record the video. Facing the investigator&#39;s official business, the woman involved not only ignored him, but also had an extremely arrogant attitude. While speaking incoherently and swearing again, she also made hilarious remarks such as &quot;please bring all the police in Singapore here.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This case has aroused a lot of resonance in the domestic public opinion field. &quot;Distorting facts,&quot; &quot;preempting portraits,&quot; and &quot;recording videos and posting them online&quot; are common tricks used in similar public opinion incidents in China, and those involved have tried them repeatedly. There are endless news stories such as &quot;Shijiazhuang woman attacks subway security guard from behind&quot;, &quot;Chongqing woman slaps security guard&quot; and &quot;Woman leads dog into elevator and posts video slandering security guard&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the woman involved encountered trouble when she tried this trick in Singapore: the nurse did not give in, the investigator did not reconcile, and the police complaint afterwards was carried out in accordance with the law. Afterwards, the woman involved confessed in court, showing that the accusation she made that &quot;the nurse discriminated against her because she was not a Singaporean and could not see a doctor&quot; was definitely a slander. She recorded a video despite three warnings and failed to gain public opinion. Instead, she got herself into trouble. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Judging from the attitude of the woman involved that she &quot;no longer defends herself, but only seeks a reduced sentence,&quot; she has realized that the &quot;script&quot; is not working and can only stop losses. At the time of the incident, he attempted to seek privileges through emotional blackmail. During the incident, he recorded a video to deny the incident in order to escape punishment. Afterwards, he finally confessed and surrendered in the face of fair law enforcement. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Secondly, this case also shows once again the importance of law as &quot;clear rules&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Singapore’s Health Minister Ong Ye Kung posted a message on social media to thank the police for their fair enforcement of the law and reiterated Singapore’s zero-tolerance attitude towards such behavior. “This is exactly the behavior we want to protect medical staff from.” According to the emergency regulations of Singapore General Hospital, patients coming for treatment are divided into four types according to their priority. The woman&#39;s minor injuries were originally considered non-emergency &quot;P3&quot; level. Medical staff give priority to using medical resources for &quot;P1&quot; and &quot;P2&quot; patients. If the woman in question is dissatisfied with this, she can go to a private hospital to spend money on medical services instead of clamoring for privileges or making up stories. Denied on the grounds of “discrimination”. At the same time, the woman involved transferred her emotions about the traffic accident to the nurses and investigators who had nothing to do with it, which was even more of a giant act without asking right from wrong. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The performance of all parties in the incident once again proved the significance of the law as &quot;clear rules&quot;. According to Section 6 of Singapore&#39;s Prevention of Harassment Act (POHA), &quot;using insulting words against public officials&quot; is a criminal offense; the woman involved did not wear a mask, spoke rudely to the nurse, and took the video without permission, which itself has violated the law. It’s not just the understatement of some marketing accounts that “just cursed a few words”. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Faced with the woman involved’s verbal attacks and filming, the police investigators did not retort, exercised a high degree of restraint, did not exceed their authority and used violence, and did not make peace with the woman involved because of her exaggerated words and deeds. , but to initiate a complaint according to the normal process; if the woman involved is not satisfied with the interview between the investigator and the police, she can also complain about it afterwards, instead of doing the words and deeds in the video that clearly violate the law. Judging from the &quot;Code of Conduct&quot; of the Singapore General Hospital, if the woman in question really encounters discrimination, she can make a complaint through normal channels. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Just because you waited for three hours does that mean you can swear at the nurse?” The investigator’s words in the video made many medical staff “relieved” because the investigator emphasized an essential point. It should be consensus common sense: the woman involved should act according to the rules and the law, and should not try to use emotional blackmail, manipulate public opinion and other unforeseen tactics, bypass the clear rules to seek privileges for herself, or kidnap justice to avoid punishment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The significance of law as a clear rule is that &quot;if a person only needs to obey the law, then he is free.&quot; The disastrous failure of the woman involved in this “cultural export” also proves once again that only by adhering to the principle of the rule of law and discord can this kind of “spin doctor” behavior no longer succeed. In similar public events, Protect the interests of other parties and maintain social justice. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 15 Oct 2023 11:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[用“算法”找到的舍友是完美选项吗？丨记者手记]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258559]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-15 10:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/13/JJWJQrgM14LzNNBhaoDc1A8mfKbnkJfWIvlQ33Xb.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;847&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/13/JJWJQrgM14LzNNBhaoDc1A8mfK bnkJfWIvlQ33Xb. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254000&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>; (Nongjian/Picture) &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;For relevant reports, please see &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.infzm.com/contents/257236 &quot; title=&quot;Roommates are in the same camp? Behind a university dormitory allocation questionnaire including MBTI&quot;>;Roommates are in the same camp? Behind a university dormitory allocation questionnaire including MBTI&lt;/a>;》&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the topic &quot;MBTI dormitory allocation statistics of Beijing Institute of Technology&quot; became a hot search topic, more and more universities refused to randomly allocate dormitories. People pay attention. However, each school has different criteria for allocating dormitories. It may be work and rest habits, major, student origin, or the most popular MBTI (Myers-Briggs Type Indicator). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The question that has been lingering in my mind throughout the interview is, would using certain specific indicators to allocate dormitories be better than randomly allocating dormitories? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, a long time ago, when the department needed to recruit interns, I tried to use MBTI to find the most &quot;perfect&quot; interns. My definition of &quot;perfect&quot; includes the following three indicators: enthusiasm for news, reliability in work, and perseverance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Originally, based on the definitions of the 16 personality types classified by MBTI, I summarized several ideal types. However, during the recruitment process of several consecutive interns, I was surprised to find that there was no one. &quot;Ideal type&quot; students send us resumes. Later, when I communicated with the editor of a magazine, she quickly found a suitable intern classmate after hearing me talk about these &quot;ideal types.&quot; One of my guesses is that when submitting resumes, she would be interested in newspapers and magazines with different styles. The preference is the manifestation of a certain personality type. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After that, my strategy became to observe among the existing intern students. If any of them showed the above three traits, then I would understand their personality type and then recruit intern students. At this time, you can follow the gourd and draw the scoop. Of course, since the sample size is far from enough, this exploration is definitely not statistically significant. In other words, it must not be generalizable to the population. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Recruiting interns is also a process of finding suitable peers. However, during the interview, we found that, unlike our definition of a “perfect intern”, each university’s definition of a “perfect roommate” The definitions are different. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some schools hope that students can chat well, and some students hope that students with outstanding performance can &quot;get rich first and then get rich later&quot;, which leads to various distribution methods. Even if they all consider the distribution of MBTI personality types and how to consider the matching of different types, the key points considered by different schools are slightly different. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If your university dormitory is randomly assigned, will you further think about this question? Why has having a perfect roommate become so important that each school needs to figure out its own &quot;algorithm&quot; &quot;Up?&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One possible answer is that the context is changing. Some people who want to improve dormitory relationships spent their college life in the 1990s or 2000. At that time, roommates were the most important partners in life. And when these people became university teachers one after another, they discovered that today&#39;s college students will understand roommate relationships from another perspective. In the manuscript, an interviewee mentioned: &quot;Many children have very clear goals after entering college: to secure a postgraduate degree and go abroad... From the beginning of their freshman year, they will arrange their lives according to their goals and will not participate in dinner parties, etc. For group activities, the dormitory may just be your own resting place.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So, are these &quot;algorithms&quot; really useful? This question will not get a definite answer in four years, or even further in the future. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If I only look at the &quot;perfect interns&quot; recruited, I will still ask each classmate about their personality type later, usually at the end of the chat, and will never refuse to let a certain classmate because of this. Come for an internship. I will also tell him my personality type. Knowing this information in advance can reduce a lot of friction in future communication. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;MBTI attempts to simplify complex individuals with some specific descriptions. In reality, even the same personality type will have completely opposite responses to difficulties. It is just a slice of a certain stage of life. The lovely thing about people is that they change every moment. A certain difficulty or a pleasant experience will make people change a little bit. Therefore, &quot;perfection&quot; should also be a process. Any &quot;perfection&quot; found with a single indicator will cease to exist the moment it is found. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 15 Oct 2023 10:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[证监会：调整优化融券相关制度， 取消上市公司高管、核心员工融券出借]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258614]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-15 09:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;span>;In order to further strengthen the countercyclical adjustment of the securities lending business, the China Securities Regulatory Commission has fully demonstrated and evaluated that based on the current market According to the situation, the system for securities lending and the lending of allotment shares to strategic investors will be adjusted and optimized in a targeted manner, and on the premise of maintaining the relative stability of the system, the securities lending and the lending of allotment shares to strategic investors will be tightened in stages. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;&lt;strong>;&lt;span>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/strong>;On the securities lending side, the securities lending margin ratio will be increased from no less than 50% to 80%, and for private securities The margin ratio for investment funds participating in securities lending will be increased to 100%, giving full play to the countercyclical adjustment function of the system.

They questioned that Xiaohongshu&#39;s AI painting product TriK was used without permission , &quot;feeding&quot; his paintings to AI training, causing copyright disputes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The incident first started when illustrator Xueyu questioned whether the pictures released by Trik AI were very similar to his original works. A few days later, many illustrators discovered that their works were suspected of being fed and edited by AI. As the incident unfolded, some original artists announced that they would stop updating, and some users changed their avatars to a unified &quot;Resist AI&quot; pattern in protest. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since 2023, ChatGPT has set off a carnival of large AI models in China. Generative AI has become unprecedentedly popular, and major Internet companies such as Baidu, Alibaba, and Byte have entered the game. Xiaohongshu is also preparing for an independent large model team and will launch &quot;Trik&quot; in April. The &quot;China Artificial Intelligence Large Model Map Research Report&quot; released at the end of May 2023 shows that 79 large models with parameters of more than 1 billion have been released nationwide. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The carnival brought about by generative AI continues, but many people are worried about whether AI will replace human jobs, and original painters are currently one of the professions most affected. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/o90KDT5Hk9wfM5y7p8knikhOeuXT3CPOHo19GSir.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/o90KDT5Hk9wfM5y7p8knikhOeuXT3CPOHo19GSir.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253662&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Original paintings under creation&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Illustrator &quot;Durian Braised Pork Ribs&quot;/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt; h4>;The artist is wandering&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The first reaction of illustrator Lin Meng was anger. She believed that everyone who devoted time and energy to the work and seriously created original works would not be able to accept it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lin Meng started painting at the age of 5 and has never stopped. When she was a child, her family conditions were average. She was sent to a painting preschool just because it was cheaper than kindergarten care at the time. It was this opportunity that paved the way for her future life. During her childhood, she was a quiet child who would not make any noise and could sit still. Drawing was a means of venting and expressing for her. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When she had no beautiful clothes to wear and longed to have them, she drew them; she secretly bought expired magazines and copied character sketches in fashion magazines, feeling happy in the process. She knew about the existence of the Academy of Fine Arts at a very young age. , that is a &quot;longing for place&quot;. According to the art teacher, she is a child &quot;born for the Academy of Fine Arts&quot;, and she probably knows that she will definitely be admitted to the Academy of Fine Arts when she grows up. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From graduating from Tianjin Academy of Fine Arts to becoming an illustrator, everything has followed the ideal pace. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As early as two years ago, she tried using AI painting. The technology at that time was limited, &quot;very childish and not very mature&quot;, but the birth of AI painting itself exceeded her imagination: cold electronic information could complete a painting through algorithm training. Later, these technological breakthroughs became more like a necessity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lin Meng does not reject AI, and science fiction themes have always been her preference in creation, just like she believes in the existence of aliens. &quot;Every field needs technological development, just like when we were children, everyone drew on paper, and later on electronic devices.&quot; From the current era to the era of artificial intelligence, how to live in harmony is a need during the transition period Something that everyone should deal with together. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The contradiction is that it is difficult to live in harmony, &quot;because it does offend our interests, and it is also a matter of dignity. If someone steals your achievements, it is difficult for you to let them take it away generously.&quot; Lin Meng feels that the unfairness of AI is that, for a work that would take a creator a month or more to create, AI can produce almost the same effect in a few minutes. Although the details are insufficient, it can already achieve what outsiders would see at first glance. Pretty good effect. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As an AI without emotions, it can achieve this effect because there are a large number of original works &quot;fed&quot;. For the original author, this is an unfair and difficult thing to solve. . Without rules and relevant legal constraints, virtuality and reality will conflict. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2018, Lin Meng settled in Xiaohongshu and successively released original works under the pseudonym &quot;Durian Braised Pork Ribs&quot;. After the incident, she announced that she would stop updating and start again on other websites. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Like Lin Meng, the original artist Li Ke decided to stop updating and changed his avatar to a &quot;Reject AI&quot; pattern after learning about Xiaohongshu and TriK&#39;s practices. When talking about this topic, he was still angry. He felt that this approach was splicing, feeding, and training rather than creation. &quot;It just plagiarized the hard work of the predecessors and stitched together corpses, so I will not endorse AI, let alone AI.&quot; We will not regard AI as a tool, it is essentially plagiarism.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After leaving the platform, going elsewhere seems to be just a temporary place to stay. It is common for unauthorized works to be used for AI training. . It seems that it is only a matter of time that the tide rolls to all corners. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In November 2022, illustrator Luo Qi also questioned on Weibo that the two-dimensional AI painting application Niji·journey was suspected of plagiarism. Many pictures generated by the application were similar to the original works of some artists. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In March 2023, NetEase’s LOFTERAI painting function was also questioned for using user works for AI training, causing many original painters to flee to other platforms. Subsequently, LOFTER removed related products from the shelves and issued an official apology letter. Nowadays, other platforms cannot guarantee that this group of &quot;wandering&quot; painters can find a shelter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In August, Station B was also on the hot search list for allegedly using AI painting to clean manuscripts and infringing the copyright of the NetEase game &quot;Yimengjianghu&quot;. At that time, netizens suspected that the &quot;Chinese Valentine&#39;s Day&quot; event promotion picture updated on the homepage of Bilibili was made using AI and incorporated the work of another original artist. It even had bugs in the details: recessed hands and only half-full shoes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Not long ago, the popular OpenAI and Microsoft received a 157-page class action lawsuit, accused of using the personal information of hundreds of millions of Internet users without permission. The plaintiff&#39;s lawyer cited a public statement by the head of OpenAI&#39;s security department, which stated that their AI product is &quot;a fairly immature technology&quot; and that without adequate security precautions, aggressive deployment of AI models would be very reckless. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Just like the painters stop editing, escape, or mark &quot;AI prohibited&quot; on their works, or learn ways to prevent being trained by AI, it is only temporary. They know very well that this will be a long process. challenge. The wave of AI is rolling forward, and all living beings are being swept up. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/lzioPAjx37uyIQOyBtFaU0Qe6BpzjiXEu7UQl4OC.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;713&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/lzioPAjx37uyIQOyBtFaU0Qe6BpzjiXEu7UQl4OC.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253656&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Illustrator&#39;s &quot;Durian Braised Pork Ribs&quot; workbench&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Illustrator &quot;Durian Braised Pork Ribs&quot;/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt; /p>; &lt;h4>;AI Impact: Some people embrace it, some people are laid off&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Zela, a professional painter who has been in the industry for two years, is one of the earliest experimenters of AI painting - she did not recognize AI at first. But now AI has been used as a tool in painting. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Her daily workflow is: learn from AI in composition, draw a sketch, and then color match according to some pictures of AI, using AI as a material library or tutor. The painting steps have not changed significantly, but Finding materials is faster. For her, the time-consuming step is not to refine, but to come up with a variety of plans for Party A to choose from in the early stage, and adjust the plans until they are finalized. This can save a lot of time on repeated work, but because she and AI are still in the running-in stage, overall Efficiency has not improved yet. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From early disapproval of AI to acceptance and embrace, the most critical reason is that Zela discovered that it can assist in painting, and half of the works generated by AI have merits, &quot;I can learn from them.&quot; , absorb.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In her opinion, AI painting is still just a tool, but it will be a trend in painting in the future, &quot;because it is too cheap and convenient, especially the people at the bottom are most affected. Visual China , Artspace, and Pixiv have opened AI contribution channels, and AI graphics have also been used commercially, mainly in design work such as new media and event posters. The impact on animation and games remains to be seen.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The game industry Practitioner Lin Yuan told &quot;Southern People Weekly&quot; that game original painters include original scene paintings, original character paintings, original art promotion paintings, etc. Many companies will outsource their game original painting design needs to specialized companies. Outsourcing pays according to the amount of each painting, which can save labor costs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“The game project I am working on has clearly used AI to do some character design. As far as I know, there are several other similar game companies that also use part of AI painting technology. The most intuitive The impact is that a need that we might have had to outsource or use internal personnel to solve can be solved directly with AI.&quot; He mentioned that some small and medium-sized factories and even large factories in the gaming field have used AI, but the degree of application is different. The degree of modification varies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lin Yuan gave an example. For example, to draw 100 original paintings, it would take 5 original painters to work for 3 months or more. Now you may only need one original artist to produce 100 pictures using AI, and he will make the modifications. This is a model that has been widely used commercially. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lin Yuan said that the current impact of AI is mainly on the lower market, and what it can replace is that part of the market that does not have high pursuit of quality and artistic attainments, such as game advertisements on web pages, many of which are drawn by AI. . Some game types that do not have high requirements for art packaging can also use AI, but for some more demanding needs, it will take time to design and polish, and currently AI is far from being able to achieve it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lin Meng’s observation is similar to this. Major manufacturers are also using AI, but most of it is only for auxiliary reference and not a complete replacement. Because the current technology cannot be replaced, but it will indeed replace some small companies that can quickly issue orders. &quot;Such market demand has always existed, but it used to take a while for painters to piece it together. AI can be very fast, in a few minutes Or a few seconds, so it threatens some companies.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The scope of the impact of AI is becoming more and more widespread. Many game companies have begun to lay off art design positions, and many companies have reduced their original paintings. Teacher position recruitment. An original artist at a game company in a second-tier city recalled that it was very popular to find a job a few years ago, but now the company has laid off a large number of people, leaving only three original artist positions, and all the others have been laid off. Large factories also have a sense of crisis. A painter from a large factory mentioned that the company has spent almost a year training AI. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“When original painters go for interviews, the salary can easily be reduced and the salary will not be too high. Some companies that deal with original painting outsourcing needs obviously feel that the demand has become less. They didn’t worry about orders a month ago, but now they may have one There are only a few orders per month. Because some requirements can already be completed using AI, this is the dilemma of the original painter.&quot; Lin Yuan&#39;s game project art director mentioned. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;AI will start by replacing labor force, just like robots replace workers in factories. Now AI is the robots in the creation factory. Those jobs that tend to be repetitive and have not so high technical content will be replaced. . Original painters will become more and more popular, and the entire industry will become more and more elite, and there will definitely be fewer positions. Unless the overall market size becomes larger.&quot; Lin Yuan believes that the emergence of AI is to meet market demand, and what can be used by existing If replaced by AI technology, it will naturally be replaced. With the improvement of AI technology in the future, the sense of crisis in the profession of painter will become stronger. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Even painters who have not been affected by AI have discovered that after the emergence of AI, customers are becoming more and more demanding on time. To a certain extent, this is a demand created by a fast-paced era, which has also pushed back changes in the entire production chain. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/2A1UGazgFur6gR3HxRnNniCiwLt46JvYpk5KfjJj.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/2A1UGazgFur6gR3HxRnNniCiwLt46JvYpk5KfjJj.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253660&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Comparison of the illustrator&#39;s &quot;It&#39;s a snow fish&quot; painting (left picture) and the image generated by Trik AI &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>; (the illustrator&#39;s &quot;It&#39;s a snow fish&quot; Fish&quot; social account/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;It is difficult to prove infringement&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The training database of generative AI is very large, which also makes the protection of intellectual property rights a difficult problem at this stage. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;You Yunting, a senior partner and intellectual property lawyer at Shanghai Dabang Law Firm, told Southern People Weekly that the main difficulty lies in providing evidence. The author has no way to prove that the platform used his own works for training. According to my country&#39;s copyright law, those who use other people&#39;s copyrighted works to train artificial intelligence must obtain the copyright owner&#39;s permission. However, the training process is not transparent, so it is difficult for authors to protect their rights. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He also mentioned that even if the works generated by artificial intelligence are relatively similar to those of the original author, if they are included in the characteristic files (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>; Refers to inconsistencies in the unique elements of the work - for example, Tencent&#39;s logo is two penguins, and the penguins&#39; scarves or bows are the feature files. If the feature files are inconsistent, it is just a black and white penguin - no will be considered to constitute copyright infringement. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu Honglin, a lawyer at Shanghai Mankiw Law Firm, also pointed out that according to existing laws and principles, if a platform uses the author&#39;s original works for AI training and content generation without obtaining copyright or copyright-authorized works, there will be Risk of copyright infringement. The difficulty is that my country&#39;s Copyright Law does not protect abstract &quot;ideas&quot; such as styles or concepts, but only protects &quot;expressions of ideas&quot; such as specific elements in paintings. However, it is precisely &quot;ideas&quot; that can reflect the author&#39;s originality. . In this context, if the author discovers that the AI ​​painting has a similar style to his own work, it will be more difficult to defend his rights; only when the AI ​​painting is obviously plagiarized, he can claim infringement liability against him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/Wp2LUMoUI8J3ToOdjJt3JaWKtIA7Mqt3dEpNSnP3.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;493&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/Wp2LUMoUI8J3ToOdjJt3JaWKtIA7Mqt3dEpNSnP3.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253658&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Many original artists on Xiaohongshu have issued suspension notices&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;How to prove it Regarding AI infringement of original creators, Liu Honglin pointed out that current AI technology is developing rapidly, the selection of materials is highly random, and the calculation rules of algorithms are complex and diverse, making it easy to avoid traces of &quot;plagiarism&quot; in generative works from a technical perspective. Therefore, in order to prove that the AI ​​image generator infringes their copyright, it is necessary to prove which specific work was copied into the AI ​​algorithm system. However, the &quot;opacity&quot; of the algorithm makes this proof idea not easy to implement in practice. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, the platform user agreement may also allow users to agree to the platform’s use for AI training without reading it carefully. One of the reasons why the Xiaohongshu incident triggered protests from painters is that according to Xiaohongshu’s user agreement, the platform has the right to directly use users’ works. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;You Yunting believes that if a platform uses users&#39; works to train artificial intelligence, it should obtain separate consent from the original author, rather than obtaining authorization with just a user agreement. &quot;Even if this user agreement is signed by the platform, it may be deemed as a standard clause that excludes the other party&#39;s main rights because no consideration is provided, which is also commonly known as the overlord clause.&quot; Liu Honglin also pointed out that some have a significant impact on user rights and interests. According to the terms and conditions, the platform is obliged to remind users. Users have the right to claim that the contract is invalid if there is obvious inequality or clauses that exempt themselves from liability and increase the liability of the other party. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Effective modifications can avoid heavy traces of AI, avoid infringement and avoid problems of too low quality.” Lin Yuan believes that the problem of infringement is difficult to solve. If you only use your own pictures or When commercial images are used to feed AI, the scope of learning is relatively narrow. To avoid infringement, the current practice is to make secondary modifications. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, there are also more cautious companies. A scene art practitioner at an overseas game company told &quot;Southern People Weekly&quot; that this issue mainly depends on the company, and different companies have different attitudes towards tools. &quot;Our company prohibits AI drawing simply because we cannot control the source of materials for AI software. You may encounter potential copyright disputes. Rather than getting involved in such litigation, it is better to prohibit it in advance.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu Honglin pointed out that the intellectual property issues caused by artificial intelligence deep learning are more complicated than general copyright infringement. . The infringement determination principles applied in traditional copyright law cannot fully respond to the infringement issues of artificial intelligence deep learning, and relevant laws and regulations need to be gradually improved. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu Honglin believes that the key to the conflict between AI and painters is that “there is currently a lack of a suitable profit distribution mechanism between the two parties. The AI ​​database uses the author’s works for data training, but there is no corresponding incentive mechanism. This is also something that the AI ​​industry needs to focus on in the future.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lin Meng, who started learning painting at the age of 5, has a corner in his home dedicated to painting, where he stores several thick albums of paintings from childhood to adulthood. Sometimes, looking through past paintings, a certain scene from my growth will reappear like a movie. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She remembered that one of the paintings was a still life gouache painting in high school, which was criticized by the teacher as having &quot;big problems&quot;. &quot;At the time, I felt like the sky was falling.&quot; But it was also the teacher&#39;s guidance. , also made her decide to focus on color and use color to express emotions. That painting was a key step in her growth. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The connection between painting and emotion is a part that AI cannot replace. Her current paintings are mainly in the cyberpunk style, but they are not mechanical in cold colors such as purple and blue. She chooses cheerful colors, mainly pink, a high-saturation cyberpunk. Lin Meng said, &quot;I hope that technology and machines will not be so cold, innocent and warm, and can be associated with cyberpunk. It is also an expectation for technology. I believe it can reach a balance point with human beings.&quot; &lt; /p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(To protect the privacy of the interviewees, Li Ke, Lin Meng, and Lin Yuan are pseudonyms in the article.)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt; /p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 15 Oct 2023 08:25:03 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
