As a result, he became a member of the punk band Cerebral Ballzy. Then, as the band became an instant hit, well-known artist Raymond Pettibon became a fan and designed the cover of one of their albums. Raymond asked Ona: Hey, I like your song, why don&#39;t you come to my studio and help? So Ona became Raymond&#39;s assistant. After familiarizing himself with all the operations of the art studio, he picked up the paintbrush himself and once again became an instant hit. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/wRIs9h63HVnEDSnKteQlhyBXor9w2yLe8a6Xcn2O.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/wRIs9h63HVnEDSnKteQlhyBXor9w2yLe8a6Xcn2O.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254467&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&quot;Ona Titus: Viewing Distance&quot; exhibition view, 2023, Longlati Jingwei Art Center, Shanghai&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Longlati Jingwei Art Center/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Asia is Exciting&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;No matter which order you listen to this story, Ona is undoubtedly an enviable lucky person. Almost as soon as he painted his first decent work, he was spotted by Taylor Gallery and brought to New York to exhibit. His paintings were hung side by side with the works of the famous Alex Katz. together. The response from the market is also exciting. Although he is just starting out and does not have any transaction records to back him up, more than 20 important collectors have expressed their intention to buy this painting. He also saw similarities in his paintings and Katz&#39;s paintings: bright colors, simple outlines, flat brushstrokes. &quot;Seeing them hang me and Katz together, I realized that people are Understand my creation.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is indeed an eye-catching work: a man and a woman are resting in a leisurely manner on the grass covered with petals. The woman has her back to the picture and cannot see clearly. On the face, the man is like a southern yuppie, wearing a suit and a Panama hat, lying on his back. The whole picture is filled with a kind of nostalgic leisure, which is reminiscent of Seurat&#39;s &quot;Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte&quot; and Manet&#39;s &quot; Lunch on the Grass. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/gaYOgkQcj7NCl425bcguB0rX24d8cbS2cSBmJoPX.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;768&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/gaYOgkQcj7NCl425bcguB0rX24d8cbS2cSBmJoPX.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254476&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&quot;Kimbella&quot;, 2021, oil on canvas, 121.9cmx152.4cm Private collection, image courtesy of the artist and Taylor Gallery&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I try to write as I go This person, while listening to his song, was frightened by the deafening noise and turned off his headphones three minutes later. I realized that the Ona who painted the painting and the Ona who was the lead singer of the band may be different aspects of the same person. The calmness, alienation, and even classicalness revealed in his paintings are nowhere to be found in his punk music. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ona&#39;s recent solo exhibition &quot;Viewing Distance&quot; at Longlati Jingwei Art Center in Shanghai is his first solo exhibition in China. Prior to this, he had just finished an exhibition at Gagosian, and Asia made him particularly excited. “I had a painting at auction two years ago, and it was finally sold for five times the estimate. The collector is from Asia. It makes me feel the acceptance of my works in the East, and I am also curious about how Chinese audiences will evaluate my paintings.&quot; His pictures can&#39;t help but be associated with the atmosphere of Impressionism, which may be due to the two-dimensional attribute - —In this matter, it was Japanese Ukiyo-e that profoundly influenced Impressionism, and Chinese ink painting that profoundly influenced Ukiyo-e—a hidden line of culture that makes it possible to see déjà vu in viewing, and also reminds this kind of viewing distance on. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Two noble men&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;It was Raymond Pattybone who introduced him to the door of painting. For Ona, the few people who worked in Raymond’s studio were The year was a time of &quot;information explosion&quot; in his life. Raymond is a comprehensive artist. He was born in the United States in 1957. He is compatible with many iconic American cultural elements and is especially good at integrating images and text. Literature, art history, philosophy, religion, politics, business, fashion, sports, and deviant youth subculture are all sources of inspiration for Raymond. This complexity greatly influenced Ona. Raymond never taught him how to draw, but often discussed literature with him. &quot;Raymond had a library, almost a small library. He often pulled out classic novels and talked to me about the stories in them.&quot; William. · Blake, Proust, John Ruskin and Walt Whitman... Literary nature constitutes Raymond&#39;s visual rhetoric and also profoundly influenced Ona. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/8uYgnmSlVfIHSOEOD2IM55hztNR7Kjo48EFaSRTk.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;687&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/8uYgnmSlVfIHSOEOD2IM55hztNR7Kjo48EFaSRTk.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254469&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&quot;AP&#39;s Joy&quot;, 2022, oil on canvas, 182.9cmx121.9cm Danjuma Collection, image courtesy of the artist and Taylor Gallery&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Also in Redmond The studio provided Ona with access to a large number of painting classics. He found that he was interested in the Nabi School of painting, including Pierre Bonnard. The style that emphasized outline and color and eliminated perspective naturally lowered the technical threshold and gave amateur painters a simple and straightforward stepping stone. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another of Ona&#39;s great friends in painting was Henry Tylor, a famous artist who also lived in Los Angeles. Taylor is an expert at depicting characters, lively and productive. &quot;Some media previously described Henry Taylor as my mentor, but he was actually just a close friend of mine.&quot; Henry Taylor held an exhibition for Ona in his studio, which was Ona&#39;s first as an artist. appearance. At that time, the COVID-19 epidemic broke out in the United States. Hundreds of guests crowded into Henry&#39;s studio. The gallerist among the guests immediately decided to take Ona&#39;s works to New York. &quot;It was really a sensation.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/3spC5kJ7sm0AnHOTstxjpylLqCYuCEoK895VcZGC.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;852&quot; height=&quot;960&quot; data -src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/3spC5kJ7sm0AnHOTstxjpylLqCYuCEoK895VcZGC.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254471&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&quot;Into the Blue&quot;, 2021, oil on canvas, 214cmx183.5cm Collection of David and Indre Roberts. Image Courtesy of the artist and Taylor Gallery&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Novel Painting&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Thanks to a writer’s eye, Ona is most interested in people. Every minute he spent on the streets of China, he was observing the crowds around him and learning to speak Chinese at every opportunity. He enjoys painting people, including people in motion, people feasting in fine clothes, and people living leisurely and alone. He fixes a certain moment of people in a specific situation, and that moment itself is narrative. When he wanders around art galleries, his eyes are always drawn to paintings about people, such as Hopper or Andy Warhol. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Different from those artists who usually accumulate visual materials and are good at photography or sketching, Ona&#39;s pictures are novel-like. He likes to paint fictitious images in his mind rather than copying real moments in life. His inspiration often comes from music or literature. &quot;I did a painting of Miles Davis riding a horse, purely from my imagination.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com /cms/medias/image/23/10/18/v1ALTKi3JPH8Ma62koQLTw1QG3Ho1RuykZMp03mD.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;768&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image /23/10/18/v1ALTKi3JPH8Ma62koQLTw1QG3Ho1RuykZMp03mD.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254474&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Summer at Dodger Hall, 2021 , oil on canvas, 152.4cmx182.9cm Collection of Rony &amp;amp; Orly Grushka, image courtesy of the artist and Taylor Gallery&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Legendary musician Miles Davis is an outstanding conductor and performer in the history of American jazz music family, but later fell into drug addiction and bankruptcy, struggling with difficulties. &quot;Miles grew up in the green countryside of St. Louis. He could ride horses as a child. Later he came to New York and entered the Juilliard School and experienced difficult times.&quot; Miles painted by Ona, Galloping horses in New York&#39;s Central Park was the image in his mind, and painting was to create images that might not exist but that the artist firmly believed existed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For Ona, painting was an unexpected success, bringing him wealth and a completely different life experience, but it delayed his ideal of becoming a writer. Music, painting, reading, writing... He jumps between different fields like a grid-jumper, with a playful agility. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;What else do you want to draw next?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I will write my novel within five years.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;What kind of novel?&quot;&lt; /p>; &lt;p>;&quot;By no means an autobiography, I hope it is the kind of novel that Fitzgerald and Salinger would write. When the time comes, I will write it.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p >;</description><pubDate> Sun, 29 Oct 2023 11:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[特朗普用自己的音色讲普通话：AI正在取代配音、口译与英语老师]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259492]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-29 10:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;My sister is a professional voice worker. She previously worked in a radio station for nearly thirty years as an announcer, Host and other jobs, now retired. It is difficult to define the concept of retirement for professional and technical personnel. They usually retire without rest: radio stations build training schools and ask her to teach broadcasting and hosting classes; relevant professional competitions ask her to be a judge and host programs; commercial organizations ask her to dub, Advertising... I used to be busy all day long, as fulfilling as working, and earning more than my pension. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But now, I am basically retired, there are fewer and fewer jobs, and the remuneration for labor is getting lower and lower. In the past few years, the remuneration for each service was around 1,000-1,500 yuan, but later it dropped to 500, and then to 200-300 yuan each time. A few days ago, a shopping website asked: Do you want to accept product advertisements worth 20-30 yuan each? She felt exhausted both physically and mentally. This was really pointless. Forget it, let&#39;s not steal the business of young girls and boys. She had a pension after all. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I watched the recent AI dubbing and was deeply shocked. I told her: It’s not you taking away the business of young girls and boys, nor is it someone taking away your business. But under the attack of AI, you will basically all be unemployed. Fortunately, I still have a pension. What should those young people who have studied broadcasting for more than ten years do? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The current AI dubbing can achieve (on the algorithm side) intelligent translation and avoid nonsensical low-level errors; (on the audio side) simulate the timbre and voice of the object, and give it the personality characteristics of spoken language; (on the audio side) Video side) Correct the mouth shape. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The result is: Swift and Trump actually spoke in very standard Chinese, while Cai Ming’s skit was performed in English. And the timbre is very similar to their own, and even the Mandarin spoken by Trump can be set to Mandarin with a slight southern accent. Not only can the sound be real, but in terms of video, their mouth shapes are highly consistent with the language they speak. Only by observing very carefully can you find traces of video modification in very few links. Based on the current speed of AI development, perhaps in a year, this weak trace of modification will be difficult to detect. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In terms of intelligent translation, Call Annie, an intelligent interactive chat system based on ChatGPT launched by Animato, has been applied to Apple 12 and above platforms. As soon as it was launched, the stock price of Chegg, an American education platform, plummeted by 50%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Call Annie is not only a chat software, but also a fully AI education system. Currently, it can provide language services in English, French, German, Spanish and other major languages, and its teaching content covers professional knowledge in various disciplines such as mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, programming, and finance. It can be expected that in the next 1-2 years, Call Annie is likely to develop to cover various human languages, including most minor languages ​​​​and even dialects, and the teaching content it can provide will increase exponentially. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What’s even more amazing is: Call Annie does not require class appointments, is currently free, and can chat 24 hours a day. It does not feel tired, irritable, angry, or needs to get off work like human teachers do. It is more patient and has a good attitude. , He also didn’t criticize or reprimand. Even though I had a poor foundation and was mentally retarded, he still took the trouble to teach. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Under such a powerful AI attack, it is estimated that many language teachers, basic knowledge teaching teachers, translators, and even university teaching assistants... as long as they are non-original research professors, will be in danger of being eliminated. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Such a powerful AI is still evolving day and night. When I fall asleep, it is still learning, iterating, and improving... I don’t know whether I should continue to call it &quot;it&quot; or prepare to change it to &quot;He, she&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The attack of AI and the challenge to existing human work are not imminent, but the &quot;wolf&quot; has already arrived. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;IBM recently stated that it will suspend recruitment for positions that may be replaced by AI in the next few years, approximately 26,000 jobs. In the next five years, 30% of these positions will be replaced by AI and automation, which will involve the work of nearly 8,000 people. This is just IBM! &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;February 2023, &quot;Fortune&quot; survey: 48% of 1,000 companies in the United States are gradually using ChatGPT to replace human employees, which will involve the work and livelihood of tens of thousands of white-collar workers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Goldman Sachs analyst Ben Snyder said: &quot;In the next 10 years, artificial intelligence may increase productivity by 1.5% per year. This may increase the profits of S&amp;P 500 companies by 30% in the next 10 years.&quot; % or more.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Not only the United States, but also all walks of life in the country have also been impacted by AI. In April 2023, a large number of original animators at game companies were laid off, and some companies even laid off more than half of their original animators. The labor remuneration for a single painting by a freelancer has dropped from 1,500 yuan to about 200 yuan. We predicted in a previous article that arts and crafts designers would gradually lose their jobs, just over a year ago. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Blue Focus, a well-known domestic advertising company, has completely stopped outsourcing copywriting and switched to AI writing. There is an e-commerce company founder who spent 3 months training GPT to write product copywriting and replaced 7 employees. Some Taobao merchants have used AI-generated digital models instead of real ones. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Therefore, my sister’s loss of her former professional voice work was not an isolated case, but just a note in the common fate of millions of professional and technical people in the context of this era. The advancement of AI has developed from the field of engineering technology to the visual arts industry, and then expanded to language and performing arts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Even Lu Qi, the former president of Baidu, said: Now there is a time for swearing every week, because I am so shocked by the technology that I can’t help but swear. Because after the emergence of ChatGPT, AI technology has been developing rapidly in days. Under the impact of the AI ​​wave, no matter whether it is science and engineering, liberal arts, or art, whether it is grassroots production personnel, professional and technical personnel, administrative personnel, or even senior executives, all People can stay out of things. Where will the development of science and technology push mankind in the future? This may have exceeded our current cognitive abilities and thinking framework. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 29 Oct 2023 10:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[生态环境部答南周：对碳排放数据弄虚作假“零容忍”]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259511]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-29 08:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/ image/23/10/28/f7ffc589d7.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/ 28/f7ffc589d7.png&quot; data-key=&quot;255859&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Liu Youbin, spokesperson of the Ministry of Ecology and Environment. Ministry of Ecology and Environment | Picture&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On October 27, 2023, the Ministry of Ecology and Environment held a regular press conference. Liu Youbin, spokesperson of the Ministry of Ecology and Environment, said that the theme of this conference is to actively respond to climate change, promote green, low-carbon and high-quality development, and release the &quot;2023 Annual Report on China&#39;s Policies and Actions to Address Climate Change&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Since the launch of the national carbon market in July 2021, the quality of carbon emission data has attracted much attention. Xia Yingxian, director of the Department of Climate Change, made his debut after taking up his new post. When answering questions from Southern Weekend reporters, he said that overall, companies&#39; awareness of emission reduction has significantly improved, their regulatory capabilities have been significantly improved, and the quality of carbon emission data has been significantly improved. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Among the measures taken by the Ministry of Ecology and Environment, the &quot;national-provincial-municipal&quot; three-level joint review mechanism for carbon emission data quality plays an important role. After enterprises submit data and certification materials through the management platform every month, national departments are responsible for big data screening and regular spot checks, provincial government departments are responsible for technical review, and prefecture-level government departments are responsible for on-site spot checks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Xia Yingxian introduced that the &quot;national-provincial-municipal&quot; three-level joint review mechanism follows the management idea of ​​&quot;using the day to protect the month, using the month to protect the year&quot; to ensure that every day , monthly, and annual data are stable and reliable, &quot;reflecting our cautious and cautious attitude towards data quality.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/28/09b6f3748b.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/28/09b6f3748b.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255860&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Xia Yingxian, Director of the Department of Climate Change Response of the Ministry of Ecology and Environment. Ministry of Ecology and Environment | Picture&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Do a good job in daily supervision of data quality&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Xia Yingxian said that the Ministry of Ecology and Environment has always attached great importance to carbon emission data quality management. There is &quot;zero tolerance&quot; for illegal and illegal activities such as data falsification. Especially since 2022, a series of measures have been taken to ensure that carbon emission data is accurate and reliable, focusing on comprehensively improving data quality. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;For example, in terms of the construction of the legal system, the Ministry of Ecology and Environment has actively cooperated with the Supreme People&#39;s Court and the Supreme People&#39;s Procuratorate to revise and issue judicial interpretations to criminalize the falsification of carbon emission data. Sanction scope. The accounting and verification guidelines were revised and introduced, reducing the formulas involved in carbon emission report verification from 27 to 12, optimizing the accounting methods, and effectively improving the pertinence, scientificity and operability of the work. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In terms of supervision and law enforcement, since 2021, the Ministry of Ecology and Environment has organized supervision and assistance, guided by problem clues, guided enterprises to standardize emission accounting reporting behaviors, and severely cracked down on Engage in deceptive behavior. Xia Yingxian said that the Ministry of Ecology and Environment will severely punish and reduce carbon emission quotas for emission-controlled companies that have verified data to be falsified in accordance with the law; it has exposed a number of third-party verification agencies that violate laws and regulations, which has a great deterrent effect. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In terms of carbon emission management capabilities, Xia Yingxian introduced that the national carbon emissions trading management platform will be launched online in 2023, realizing inventory management, emission management, and data quality supervision. , verification management, and quota management are intelligent and digital, and big data means are used to enrich data quality management technical means. Since 2023, the Ministry of Ecology and Environment has held 5 special training courses on carbon emission data quality management and supervision and law enforcement, with more than 5,000 trainees, and supervision capabilities have been significantly improved. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Xia Yingxian also said that in the next step, we will continue to do a good job in daily supervision of data quality and make full use of the &quot;national-provincial-municipal&quot; three-level joint review working mechanism. Conduct spot checks and reports on data quality management work in various regions, establish and improve daily supervision and technical review systems for greenhouse gas emission data, clarify technical review standards and procedures, and consolidate the main responsibilities of key emission units. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Carbon price is in line with China’s current reality&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;At the press conference , Xia Yingxian also mentioned the progress of the national carbon market construction. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;A total of 2,257 key emission units in the power generation industry have been included in the second compliance cycle (2021 and 2022) of the national carbon market, covering annual carbon dioxide emissions of more than 5 billion tons. . The quotas for 2021 and 2022 have been distributed in August 2023, and payment and compliance are currently underway. Xia Yingxian revealed that the current contract fulfillment rate has exceeded 60%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Xia Yingxian believes that the national carbon market has achieved the expected construction goals. &quot;After more than two years of construction and operation, the overall operation of the national carbon market is stable, the price discovery mechanism has initially appeared, and corporate emission reduction awareness and capabilities have been significantly enhanced, playing a positive role in promoting the goal of achieving carbon peak and carbon neutrality.&quot;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Xia Yingxian said that the national carbon market has initially established an institutional framework system, breaking through the blocking points in key links such as reporting verification, quota allocation, market transactions, settlement and compliance, etc. Difficulties, and realize full-service intelligence through the national carbon market management platform. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Regarding the topic of carbon market expansion, Xia Yingxian stated that it is urgent to include more qualified industries into the national carbon emissions trading market to reduce the cost of emission reduction for the whole society. We will insist on making progress while maintaining stability, and prioritize the inclusion of industries that contribute significantly to achieving the goal of carbon peak and carbon neutrality, have serious overcapacity, have great synergy potential for pollution reduction and carbon reduction, and have good data quality foundations. Each mature industry will be included in the industry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The expansion of the carbon market requires a good data foundation. Xia Yingxian introduced that the Ministry of Ecology and Environment conducts annual carbon emission accounting report verification work nationwide every year for petrochemical, chemical, building materials, steel, non-ferrous metals, papermaking, civil aviation and other industries, and collects data from more than 6,000 companies. The above-mentioned 7 industries The total direct emissions from the power generation and power generation industries account for more than 70% of the country&#39;s total. In addition, special studies were organized on quota allocation methods, accounting and reporting methods, verification points, and expansion implementation paths for seven industries. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;As of October 25, 2023, the cumulative transaction volume of carbon emission quotas is 365 million tons, and the cumulative transaction volume is 19.437 billion yuan. The carbon price after the launch of the national carbon market Maintained at around 50-80 yuan/ton. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Recently, the quota price has shown an overall upward trend, maintaining at around 80 yuan/ton. The moderate increase in carbon price reflects the market nature of carbon price.&quot; Xia Yingxian believes that the carbon price is in line with China&#39;s current reality and basically reflects my country’s emission reduction costs. In the next step, we will study the establishment of a market adjustment mechanism and take measures such as early warning of contract performance risks to adjust market supply and demand, enhance market vitality, and ensure the healthy, stable and orderly operation of the market. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 29 Oct 2023 08:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[从“三吠举报”到“恶犬法案”：美国人怎么养狗？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259368]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-28 23:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;It is well known that many people in the United States love dogs. However, these Americans love and raise dogs to achieve a certain balance under the support of their specific natural conditions, social conditions and legal environment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First of all, in my opinion, the most important and overlooked point is that the United States is not a rabies epidemic area. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A total of 202 human rabies cases were reported in 143 districts and counties in China in 2020. Dogs in the United States hardly carry the rabies virus, and the few rabies cases are caused by wild animals (mainly bats). A total of five people died of rabies in the United States in 2021, the highest number of rabies deaths in the country in 10 years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Differences in natural conditions will cause huge differences in social adaptation. When there are no worries about rabies, the intimacy between humans and cats and dogs will greatly increase, and dogs will not be too taboo about what they eat or lick. Even strange stray dogs don’t have to worry about rabies. This creates a close human-dog relationship. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The second is the living area and living pattern of Americans. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2021, the per capita housing area in the United States is 67 square meters, ranking first in the world. In addition to the large average area, there are also structural differences in urbanization rates. The overall average urbanization rate in the United States currently reaches 83%, and the urbanization rate in some metropolitan areas is close to 100%. China&#39;s urbanization rate in 2022 will be 65.22%. The problem of dog ownership is largely an urban problem. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Calculated in terms of per capita housing area in domestic cities, especially large and medium-sized cities, it is about half that of the United States. This is just the living area, not the living mode. Chinese people mostly live in high-rise buildings and share the green environment of the community, while Americans mostly live in suburban villas. Americans have far more outdoor space per household. Therefore, Chinese people use half of their living area and much less public outdoor area to raise dogs, which naturally creates more conflicts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The United States also has another characteristic, that is, it is more diverse, has a large place, has many choices, and does not interfere with each other. It not only protects the rights of dog lovers, but also protects the rights of people who do not love dogs. There are many communities in the United States that prohibit pets. Not only are dogs not allowed in these communities, but dogs from outside are not even allowed to &quot;visit&quot;. Have a peaceful time together. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although Americans love dogs, and although the living area is large, the density is low, and there are many green spaces, it does not mean that American dogs do not bite people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the U.S. National Library of Medicine, approximately 1,000 people in the United States require emergency care treatment for serious dog bites every day, and more than 4.5 million people are bitten by dogs each year, with 30 to 50 People are killed by dogs. Injuries caused by dog ​​bites and attacks result in the need for 30,000 surgeries in the United States each year, including sutures and staples. In 2020, U.S. insurance companies paid $854 million for dog bites and attacks, with the average dog bite insurance claim amount being $50,245. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Humane Society of the United States estimates that 51% of dog bite victims are children, which means more than 2 million children are bitten by dogs in the United States each year. Among dog bite deaths, the highest proportion is among those aged 0-4 years. Since children under 1 year old are often unable to walk and are often looked after by adults, the rate of bites is the lowest. After the age of 4, as children get older, the likelihood of being bitten decreases. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So, although Americans love dogs, they also strictly manage dog ownership. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For general harassment, take New York City as an example. If you are reported for not picking up dog poop while walking your dog, the police will issue a $250 (1,800 RMB) fine and may also require you to appear in court. The law also prohibits the harassment of pet dogs in all public and private places. If the dog is not kept on a leash, a fine of 200-400 US dollars will be imposed. For dog nuisances, follow the &quot;three barking report&quot; principle: if a dog from any household barks more than three times in a residential area, it will be considered a nuisance, and neighbors can report it. Under strict regulations, most dog walkers in the United States are self-conscious, and leash-free dog walking is rare. If a dog poops, most dog owners use plastic bags to collect the poop. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, the law stipulates that people who keep high-risk ferocious dogs must erect signs in conspicuous places in their yards to remind passersby to pay attention. In public places, high-risk ferocious dogs must wear a restraint leash and an anti-bite muzzle at all times. Otherwise, law enforcement agencies have the right to impound or execute the dog. Depending on the severity of the case, the dog owner may be held criminally responsible and may even be sentenced to 90 days in jail. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For higher levels of physical risk, some states have enacted so-called &quot;vicious dog laws.&quot; A dog is considered a &quot;vicious dog&quot; if it attacks or injures a human or their pet within a two-year period, or exhibits aggressive behavior that requires the police or animal control agencies to stop or drive away. Such dogs must be isolated, prohibited from contact with humans, and undergo mandatory training. If the owner refuses to cooperate, the dog may be euthanized. The Vicious Dog Act requires dog owners to take full responsibility for their dogs. If a dog attacks a person and the owner fails to take strict precautions and deal with it promptly, resulting in casualties, the dog owner must be responsible for all injuries and may even be subject to criminal penalties. If a dog attacks a human after escaping, the owner is still responsible for the dog&#39;s behavior. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are very sound pet shelters and rescue stations across the United States, funded by the government and private organizations, to take in and rescue stray cats and dogs. In shelters, sheltered dogs and other animals are treated well. Americans love dogs, and there are always enough volunteers at shelters. Stray dogs in shelters generally have a 1-2 week deadline for adoption. Non-governmental animal protection organizations also try their best to allow dogs in shelters to be adopted. After that, if no one comes to adopt them, they will be euthanized. Statistics show that of the 8.5 million stray dogs sheltered in the United States in 2010, 82% were adopted and taken away by new owners, while the remaining 1.53 million old, sick, and unadopted dogs were euthanized. Although many civil organizations are trying to change euthanasia and replace it with sterilization, raising funds is still an unavoidable obstacle. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;All public issues are like this. Rights and obligations cannot be neglected or mentioned only on one side. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 28 Oct 2023 23:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[年度佳作，没有人经得起剖析审视]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259240]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-28 22:01:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data-mpa-powered-by=&quot;yiban.io&quot;>;&lt;span>;There are many movies about marriage.

&lt;p>;&lt;span>;可他们一家的住所前不着村后不着店，事发时也没有其他外人在场，塞缪尔平时更没仇家。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;于是，犯罪片&lt;/span>;中常见的定论便呼之欲出：凶手是妻子桑德拉，她一定是对丈夫心怀怨恨。真相果真如此吗？ &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;span>;&lt;strong>;02&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;桑德拉作为第一犯罪嫌疑人被控制了起来，丹尼尔则是现场唯一证人。想证明自己无罪，桑德拉必须说服法官，她与丈夫之间有爱无恨，她没有杀人的动机。至此，&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;一桩死亡案件便成了对于一场婚姻的审判。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;《坠楼死亡的剖析》也由此进入了婚姻关系的精细&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;剖析：在一&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;人死亡的情况下，另一方要如何自证？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;&lt;span>;她一方面极具创造力的将婚姻关系放置到法庭这个场景中去剖析，另一方面又依旧抱有女性特有温柔与先锋。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;比如女主桑德拉的设置上，她身上带有浓厚的雌雄同体气质，这就区别于常见的女性形象。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/16e460de70bbb0da317356adaee6a64a.gif&quot;

&lt;p>;同时，于相比常见设置，桑德拉与塞缪尔的处境和性格也是颠倒的：桑德拉事业成功，性格平和，与孩子也亲密无间；而塞缪尔不仅遭遇&lt;span>;了职业发展瓶颈，也更情绪化，创作力枯竭。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;这种形象和性别设置本身就突破了男性叙事的窠臼。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;此外，电影用沉着克制的镜头语言和叙事表达，试图在死亡案件的真相更深处，给予观众以一种超脱案件本身的清醒。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;电影中出现过两段录音，一段是女学生当日的采访，另一段是塞缪尔私自录下的争吵。这两段日常对话，在法庭上被当众逐字逐句分析解读，甚至被当作犯罪的证据。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;当第二段由塞缪尔所开始的争吵出现在法庭上时，性别天平开始倾斜，桑德拉就需要去解释塞缪尔所有的困境：为什么他要在工作与家庭之间做选择？为什么他总是没有时间写小说？为什么他创作力枯竭而她却频繁出版小说？为什么他性冷淡而她却肉体出轨？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;早晨9点，从拉萨北郊汽车站出发，一路经过美丽的羊湖、成排的雪山，抵达洛扎县时大约是下午4点，我马上在车站买了每天唯一一趟去色乡的车票。开往色乡仍需近两个小时，路面开始变窄，碎石也变多了。但我一路仍被窗外贫瘠而壮观的景色吸引。车子一边贴着裸露的山石，另一边则紧邻奔腾的河流，河水快活地向前奔流，彷佛在和汽车赛跑。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/4CJwybPlikMf1N8rb8DErCaYsiUpV1g4HfqvdEr5.jpg&quot;

&lt;p>;抵达色乡时已经7点半，趁着天还没黑，我赶紧找住处。整个乡镇位于山间一块平地上，沿着公路建了几十栋楼房，都是当地人自住，为了迎接客人，有的被改为宾馆，有的被改为餐厅。宾馆要么关着，要么满了，老板很少在，只留下一个电话号码。最后，我终于在赛卡古托寺宾馆找到了一个床位，有公共卫生间，但不能洗澡。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/Zr1UWUXJhF4ejzye7gI0fYIs2ePDIci33DQAPxht.jpg&quot;

&lt;p>;赛卡古托寺的9层碉楼背后有着一段传奇感人的救赎故事。相传11世纪时，被誉为“古代西藏七大译师之一”的噶举派创始人玛尔巴有一位弟子叫米拉日巴，他幼年丧父，财富被亲戚霸占，家人被奴役，长大后学成法术，为报仇杀了35个人。后为赎罪，米拉日巴来到色乡向玛尔巴拜师，玛尔巴命米拉日巴独自建立赛卡古托寺（&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;意为“九层公子堡”&lt;/span>;）。日复一日，年复一年，每当他建成时，玛尔巴都让他推翻重建，直至第六次才终于落成。如今的赛卡古托寺即为当时所建（&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;后经维修扩建&lt;/span>;）。黄色为主的寺庙外围悬挂着古老的转经筒，殿内斑驳脱落的墙壁上隐隐还能看到几百年前的壁画。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/pxdG2sSTqGXq9MC2LtS1A4lLkzoChetIoN1Fsd6t.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;641&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/pxdG2sSTqGXq9MC2LtS1A4lLkzoChetIoN1Fsd6t.jpg&quot;

&lt;p>;赛卡古托寺很小，不到半个小时就走完了。在色乡南面山顶上，还有一座洛卓窝隆寺，它是藏传佛教噶举派的发源地，是玛尔巴大师29岁时所修建的。据洛扎县政府官网介绍，“洛”指的是“南方”，“卓窝”是“开始吉祥”，“隆”意为“授记”，洛卓窝隆寺就是上师预言授记的地方。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;步行到山顶洛卓窝隆寺要走几个小时，且没有公共交通，我在路上找便车搭，遇到一个藏族家庭开车上山，载上了我。这家人来自邻县错那县，第一次来洛扎县朝圣。 &lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;山上只有寺庙，景观极其开阔，几只巨大的乌鸦在头顶盘旋着，云的影子投在山上。洛卓窝隆寺沿着山巅的石壁而建，除了主要的庙宇，崖壁下还散布着很多小小的隐修室。一位修行多年的喇嘛已长发及腰。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;洛卓窝隆寺里的喇嘛是我遇到过的最热情的喇嘛。他们给上山的每个人讲解庙宇背后的故事，虽然只有我一个汉族游客，他们讲完一长串藏语后，还会专门用汉语给我再讲一遍。据他们说，老洛卓窝隆寺曾遭毁坏，现存为1992年重建。山上最顶端有一座天葬台，二十多岁的喇嘛介绍说，这是以玛尔巴从印度学经12年后背回来的一块石头为基础建成的。寺庙脚下的山坡上有一块平地被经幡围绕，堆着石头的地方就是顺缘田，相传是玛尔巴和米拉日巴两人第一次见面的地方。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我们在山上待了半天多，期间恰逢寺庙举办法会，见证了藏传佛教的法会典礼。最后，我又跟着藏族家庭一起下山，汽车绕着“之”字形的路又回到色乡。我们分开，继续各自的旅行。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot;

Why is it so fussy? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to reports from the Hunan Radio and Television Urban Channel, a new road in Changsha City that nearby residents have long awaited will be opened soon. However, a section of this road was suddenly surrounded again recently, and excavators were excavating the paved asphalt road. Street lights, street trees and other facilities on the roadside were also dismantled and removed, and garbage trucks were also brought in from other places. The loess was transported and poured on the road. What happened? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It turns out that the main part of this road is in Changsha Economic Development Zone, but it extends 120 meters to Furong District. When the Economic Development Zone Urban Construction Company was building the road, it built an extra 120 meters along the way without going through the construction application procedures with the relevant departments of Furong District. The Furong District Natural Resources and Planning Department determined that this was “illegal land occupation.” As a result, the Economic Development Zone Urban Construction Company responsible for the construction began to demolish the road. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to media reports, staff from the Economic Development Zone Urban Construction Company said that they agreed that the land was indeed being used illegally, but they were &quot;purely out of good intentions.&quot; Also, if we don&#39;t build more of these 120 meters, there may be no way to connect it with other roads, and there will be a section of &quot;intestinal obstruction&quot; in the middle, so it won&#39;t make much sense to build this road, so we &quot;kindly&quot; help and provide money and efforts to complete it. The more than 100 meters of road should be repaired. So when they were deemed illegal by the relevant departments of Furong District, they felt a little aggrieved. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For Furong District, the extra 120 meters of road construction is within my jurisdiction. According to regulations, road construction should follow procedures and be submitted for approval in advance. It is of course illegal to build roads without approval. The competent department requires that the illegal status be eliminated and the construction be restored to its original state. The construction application procedures will be completed before re-repairing, which is completely &quot;in accordance with the law and regulations and in compliance with the procedures.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There seems to be nothing wrong with both sides. However, after construction and demolition, demolition and construction again, a lot of money was wasted. What went wrong? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Jingkai District Urban Construction Company that built the road built it without approval. Of course, there were violations of laws and regulations. However, the road has been repaired, and it is indeed a road that has been long-awaited by the nearby people and is necessary to be repaired. However, if it is forced to be demolished, the problem may be even greater. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First of all this is a huge waste of public funds. Although the 120-meter road is not long, it costs a lot. The entire road is about 1 kilometer long and costs 60 million yuan. Calculating the cost of 120 meters is 6 to 7 million yuan, and dismantling it will also cost a lot of money. Once it was built or demolished, millions would disappear. This is a municipal road, and the Economic Development Zone Urban Construction Company responsible for its construction is also a state-owned enterprise. The source of its construction funds must be public funds of the local government, that is, public money. For Furong District, it is a good thing that the Economic Development Zone is willing to spend the money to build its own roads. If it is forced to be demolished and then rebuilt by oneself, although the cost of demolition will be borne by the Economic Development District Urban Construction Company, the cost of reconstruction will still be borne by Furong District. It is also incomprehensible to abandon existing roads that have been built with help from others and to dig up and spend money to rebuild them yourself. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Secondly, a section of the repaired road is dug out, and the rest becomes a dead end road. It took three years to build this road, and the nearby people had been waiting for it for three years. It was finally opened, but a section was demolished, and its effectiveness was greatly reduced. If we have to go through the formalities and rebuild it again, I am afraid we will have to wait at least another year and a half. This will bring great inconvenience to the public&#39;s travel and will also damage the image of the local government in the public mind. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Requiring the Economic Development Zone to demolish the roads and then rebuild them themselves can be said to be harmful to Furong District and not beneficial to itself. So why do the relevant departments in Furong District do this? From the perspective of organizational behavior, perhaps one or two explanations can be given. For some departments, they must make the decision on their own territory. It is absolutely unacceptable for others to interfere with their boundaries without telling them. Even if you spend more money, you must maintain your authority. After all, if you want to spend money, it is also a financial expense, rather than having to pay out of your own pocket. Only consider issues from the perspective of one place and one department, from the perspective of maintaining the authority of the local area and this department, only consider legal compliance from the perspective of this department, and show your sense of existence. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for whether the decision made is reasonable from a higher level, whether it will waste financial resources and state-owned assets, waste local taxpayers&#39; money and public interests and perceptions, and consume administrative credibility, it is not considered. scope. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This incident shows the fragmentation and lack of coordination among relevant government departments, the lack of appreciation for the use of fiscal funds, and the lack of care for the waste of state-owned assets. Such things are not uncommon. In the past few years, roads in some cities have been dug up frequently. Today they are laying water pipes, tomorrow they are burying wires, and the day after tomorrow they have to repair sewers. Frequently digging and repairing, repairing and digging again not only wastes construction funds, but also doubles the construction period and brings great inconvenience to citizens&#39; travel. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fortunately, after the media reports this time, the relevant departments of Changsha Furong District have urgently stopped the behavior of damaging the road surface, and have speeded up the relevant procedures to legalize the 120-meter road as soon as possible. This case has been solved. I hope there will be fewer such absurd things in the future. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 28 Oct 2023 20:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[“软实力之父”约瑟夫·奈：“中美间的交流应该是面向所有人的”]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259507]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-28 19:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Is there destined to be a war between China and the United States? My answer Yes, no.&quot; Joseph Nye, a professor at Harvard Kennedy School, gave a negative answer. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Joseph Nye is a representative figure of the neoliberal school of international relations. Before and after the Cold War, Joseph Nye was famous for proposing the concept of &quot;soft power&quot;. Soft power refers to a country&#39;s strength other than economic and military strength, and mainly refers to influence such as culture, values, and public opinion. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;He served successively as Assistant Secretary of State in the Carter administration, Chairman of the National Intelligence Council and Assistant Secretary of Defense in the Clinton administration. He is also a leading figure in American politics. But he reminded that the history of mankind is full of situations where wars &quot;accidentally&quot; entered. As long as China and the United States strengthen cooperation and act cautiously, wars can be avoided. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;China-US relations are one of the most important bilateral relations in the world today. On October 27, 2023, U.S. President Biden met at the White House with visiting member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and Foreign Minister Wang Yi. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Since October 23, Joseph Nye has embarked on his first visit to China after the COVID-19 epidemic. Judging from the public schedule in just one week, the &quot;Father of Soft Power&quot; has successively attended speeches at many think tanks and universities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On the afternoon of October 25, in the Qiulin Lecture Hall of the School of International Relations at Peking University, Joseph Nye spoke with the topic &quot;Are China and the United States destined to have a war?&quot; Hundreds of teachers and students discussed &quot;The History and Future of Sino-US Relations.&quot; The conference was jointly hosted by the School of International Relations at Peking University and the Institute of International Strategic Studies at Peking University. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Joseph Nye once proposed the &quot;20-year cycle theory of Sino-US relations&quot;, that is, since the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and the United States, the ups and downs of the relationship between the two countries have been based on a 20-year cycle. And change. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;In the long run, China and the United States will have better relations. But in the short term, China and the United States still have differences to resolve.&quot; Joseph Nye told the South Weekend reporter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Joseph Nye believes that after 2017, Sino-US relations entered a cycle of great power competition. &quot;China-U.S. relations have gotten worse in the past. In a sense, I think we have seen the deterioration of Sino-U.S. relations, but I hope things will get better.&quot; Joseph Nye told Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In recent years, discussions about the &quot;new cold war&quot; between China and the United States have been rampant in European and American public opinion circles. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In Joseph Nye&#39;s view, the Cold War between China and the United States is completely incommensurable with the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union. “During the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union, although there was military and political competition between the two countries, their economic and social ties were very sparse. But now China and the United States are highly interdependent in many fields such as economy, society, and ecology. ”&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In 2020, Joseph Nye wrote an article in the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; that the Cold War between China and the United States is completely avoidable. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Joseph Nye supports China and the United States in strengthening cooperation in public health, climate change and other fields. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Exchanges between China and the United States should be open to everyone. Exchanges at the cultural and scientific levels are equally important.&quot; Joseph Nye told Southern Weekend reporters that he hopes The public&#39;s attention should not only focus on high-level people, but also exert soft power. Low-level contacts are also very important. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;The following is an interview with Joseph Nye:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Sino-US relations have gotten worse in the past. In a sense, we have seen a deterioration in Sino-US relations, but I hope things will get better. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Unfortunately, during the COVID-19 epidemic, communication between China and the United States has not been sufficient. However, communication between China and the United States has begun to change. The United States sent important cabinet members to visit China, and Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi also arrived in Washington for a visit. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;I think Sino-US relations are making progress. Two years ago, Sino-US relations were worse than they are now. What we&#39;re seeing today is some pickup, and I hope it continues. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Among China and the United States, China not only has strong economic performance, but also has the attraction of traditional culture. I believe that a country’s soft power comes not only from government actions but also from civil society. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The U.S. government often does some unpopular things, but despite this, America&#39;s civil society remains attractive to others because it is relatively free. Therefore, the soft power of the United States comes more from universities, non-profit organizations, and foundations, such as the Bill Gates Foundation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;It is undeniable that people&#39;s views of the United States have gone up and down in recent years. In my opinion, the soft power of the United States has gone up and down. During the Vietnam War and when U.S. troops invaded Iraq, U.S. soft power was declining. The soft power of the United States returned again with the election of Obama as President of the United States in 2008, and fell together with Trump (who became President of the United States) in 2016. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Soft power does not decline linearly or rise linearly. It is often cyclical. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Now, the soft power of the United States is weakening due to internal divisions within the United States. On the other hand, if you look at the hard power of the United States, you will see that the U.S. economy is booming. The United States is a wellspring of innovation, leading in technological fields such as biotechnology and artificial intelligence. Looking at the situation in the Middle East today, (U.S.) military power is still very important. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The Biden administration has been in power for three years and has a more balanced view (compared to the Trump administration). They still believe there are still benefits to working with China. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In May this year, the G7 summit changed its focus on decoupling from China to de-risking on China. This expression means Countries outside the G7 will adopt partial decoupling from China, mostly in the security field. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In other words, de-risking does not mean completely cutting off economic ties, but there are limits. U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan called it &quot;building a high wall around a small yard.&quot; We should not let this small yard grow. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;To prevent deterioration, Sino-US relations should start with high-level contacts. Next, look for areas of cooperation between China and the United States, which can convey to the public of both countries that cooperation with another country is beneficial. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;I think this is an area where China and the United States can strengthen cooperation (position on the Russia-Ukraine conflict). &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;China and the United States can also strengthen cooperation in other areas, such as climate change and working with the WHO to respond to epidemics. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Exchanges between China and the United States should be open to everyone. Obviously, people always focus on the president or the cabinet. Exchange on cultural and scientific levels is equally important. If we need to build trust and cooperation (with each other) and exert soft power, low-level engagement is very important. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;(Sino-US relations) have become increasingly complex and difficult to resolve in the short term. I tend to use &quot;short-term pessimists&quot; and &quot;long-term optimists&quot; to describe China and the United States as not posing a threat to each other. In the long run, China and the United States will have better relations. But in the short term, China and the United States still have differences to resolve. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 28 Oct 2023 19:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[一斤力气9分钱，重庆最后的女棒棒]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259500]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-28 18:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;July 2021, Chongqing Mountain City Trail, sculptures representing Chongqing sticks and traditional stilted buildings .

This is the largest water pier in Chongqing. South of the Jialing River and on the north bank of the Yangtze River is the Yangtze River Binjiang Road. On this modern street, there is the Chaotianmen Comprehensive Trading Market, the largest wholesale market gathering place in Chongqing. It is like a streamer, flowing with people buying goods from all over the country. Chongqing’s economy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The mountainous city of Chongqing has steep roads and few flat areas, and its unique topography provides Bangbang with a living space. &quot;Bangbang&quot; is a Chongqing dialect that originally means &quot;stick&quot;. It is a local name for farmers who carry a bamboo stick and engage in heavy manual labor. In the Chaotianmen Comprehensive Trading Market, Bangbangs are responsible for the last link in this economic chain: transportation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;If you look carefully, you can find a few female figures among the sticks passing through the shops in the market. With their hair cut short or in buns, they look sophisticated and sophisticated, just like the men who dominate the industry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Some of them work alone, and some open &quot;couple teams&quot;. In industries where they sell their physical strength to make a living, they often have to deal with employers questioning their &quot;business capabilities.&quot; But even so, they don&#39;t want to give up the stick. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“Moving things uphill is the most annoying thing”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;At Chaotianmen at 6 o&#39;clock in the morning, the freighter on the riverside sounded its whistle, and the truck and asphalt The sound of the road rubbing against each other was more lively than the Chongqing night market. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On September 30, 2023, Huang Xiuli opened the window, and the noise and sunlight penetrated into the room. On the floor were corrugated boxes of pickles and corrugated boxes that Huang Xiuli had collected from various places. Drink bottles and leftovers were scattered on the table... Huang Xiuli picked out this house filled with musty smell one pound at a time. of. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Huang Xiuli has been a &quot;professional player&quot; for 24 years. A stick, a three-meter-long red nylon rope, and a 232 yuan trolley are all her assistants in her work. Every morning at 6:45, Huang Xiuli goes to work in Dazheng Shopping Mall on time.

He has been selling men&#39;s clothing in Dazheng Shopping Mall for 25 years , with a bulging beer belly and a conspicuous bald head. Every morning when Liu Youtou was sorting out the cargo list, Huang Xiuli came over to help him load and carry the goods bag by bag according to the delivery location. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Liu Youtou agreed to pay 30 yuan per bag, which was the better price Huang Xiuli could get at Chaotianmen Market. One bag weighs 309.6 kilograms, and the straight-line distance is 324 meters - in 2023, Huang Xiuli&#39;s effort is worth an average of 9 cents per kilogram. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;It&#39;s affordable, usually more than ten yuan.&quot; Most of the goods she carries are clothing, which are light in weight and correspondingly priced lower. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;According to Huang Xiuli’s experience, you need to use your brain to carry goods and not be reckless. In order to reduce air resistance, she lowered her head when pulling goods; she wore gloves on her hands to increase friction with the cart. &quot;The most annoying thing is carrying things uphill. Carrying it alone makes my head hurt.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In her early years at Chaotianmen, on the way home, Huang Xiuli’s inventory list Her bag was robbed by a motorcycle. &quot;How can I bear it? It&#39;s my hard-earned money.&quot; In order to keep the money, Huang Xiuli competed with the motorcycle, causing the bones of her upper arm to shift. &quot;I spent thousands, but the doctor didn&#39;t give me any money.&quot; Cure”. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Later, for unknown reasons, the soles of Huang Xiuli’s feet swelled up. When she woke up, she started to feel pain when she stepped on the ground early in the morning. She thought about inserting acupuncture and applying medicinal wine on her own, but the more treatment she got, the more &quot;irritated&quot; she became. Therefore, Huang Xiuli likes to roll up half of her trouser legs to &quot;air out&quot; her calves. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Due to physical pain, Huang Xiuli would move sideways slowly when lifting large heavy objects uphill or downhill. For a large box over one meter high, Huang Xiuli will first unfold the rope and move it under the heavy object, lift the two ends, cross-tie them and put them on bamboo sticks, and support the goods with both hands while walking. For Huang Xiuli, the body is not only a tool, but also her partner. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;At 4 p.m., every merchant in the Chaotianmen Wholesale Market pulled down their rolling shutters. Huang Xiuli hid her sticks and trucks in the mall and went home to cook. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;When going uphill and downhill, Huang Xiuli cannot use a cart and needs to carry the goods manually.

She is the youngest in her family and has four sisters. When she was in the countryside, Huang Xiuli often dragged her sister&#39;s large clothes to the fields to break buds, harvest wheat, and thresh millet. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Even if she works from dawn to dusk in the village, Huang Xiuli earns only enough money to feed herself. She decided to visit the city. The night before leaving Dianjiang, she went to the bamboo forest in the mountains and cut two bamboos, thinking that she would make money from this stick in the future. That night, Huang Xiuli slept with Bangbang in her arms. The next day, she closed the doors and windows and went straight to the city. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Huang Xiuli came to Chaotianmen in 1997. She was 26 years old that year. She had no crow&#39;s feet in her eyes, slightly curly black hair, tied with a black rubber band, and was energetic. Capable. The reason why I came to Chaotianmen is because this is the Feng Shui treasure land for Bangbang people to make a fortune. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In 1991, Chaotianmen Comprehensive Trading Market officially opened. By 1997, the market business area had grown from the initial 6,000 square meters to 270,000 square meters, and the number of operating households had grown from more than 500 to more than 10,000. In 1996, the annual transaction volume of the market here reached 3 billion yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;At that time, on Chaodong Road where Bangbang lived, Peng Li, who was in charge of Chongqing Bishan Logistics, opened a freight order of more than 20,000 yuan a day. &quot;My joints hurt so much when I started to write,&quot; Peng Li said in pain and happiness. Liu You&#39;s first day&#39;s trade volume can reach more than 30,000 yuan. He describes his orders as being like a train pulling coal with no end in sight. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Gao Zongqi also caught up with this wave of &quot;dividends&quot;. In the late 1990s, Gao Zongqi and Lao Zhao, who were from Qijiang, grew corn in their hometown. In the first year, they took their products to the city to sell them, but half of them were robbed before they even entered the city. They lost money. The next year, I took it to the city to sell it and made another loss. I heard that you can make money by helping people carry things in the city, so the couple picked up the stick and went to Chaotianmen. &quot;I can&#39;t read, so it&#39;s safer to be with my husband.&quot; This has been followed in Chaotianmen for 19 years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;At the end of each year, the couple will receive a package fee of 10,000 yuan from their boss. Zhao laughed and said that he also gets a &quot;year-end bonus&quot; like white-collar workers. They relied on this &quot;year-end bonus&quot; to cover the expenses of returning home for the New Year. Gao Zongqi&#39;s parents praised their son-in-law for his promise. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Zhao Dongqiu came to Chaotianmen for his son&#39;s wife Ben. Thirty years ago, Zhao Dongqiu and her husband opened a retail store in Anyue County, Sichuan. Although they made more money than farming, the couple was still worried about when they would be able to buy a house for their son and marry him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;After chatting with someone, I learned that being a stick can make money quickly. The couple cut two sections of bamboo in their own mountain, scraped off the bamboo skin with a sickle, and wrapped the bamboo around them. We put on tape and nylon rope, bought tickets overnight, and arrived at Chaotianmen in the early morning. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;When he first came to Chaotianmen, Zhao Dongqiu&#39;s income was only two yuan a day. But she was not in a hurry and wandered around with the rope (rope) on her back. For four months, Zhao Dongqiu wandered around in Chaotianmen and found out about her own &quot;human society&quot;: Which family had a girl who was many years old, and which family had a miserable life. She knew clearly, &quot;We must first get familiar with the circle before others can shout It’s up to you, otherwise I can only work on a blank slate (not earning a penny).” &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Slowly, 5 yuan, 10 yuan... more and more consignment notes entered Zhao Dongqiu&#39;s pocket. In 2003, the &quot;starting price&quot; of Bangbang was 15 yuan, and Zhao Dongqiu and her husband could get orders of more than 10,000 yuan in a month at most. When carrying goods, Zhao Dongqiu often wears jeans, a yellow shirt worth more than 30 yuan, and a thin gold necklace around his neck. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The cakes in Chaotianmen Comprehensive Trade Market are getting bigger and bigger, and there are more and more sticks. Chongqing University&#39;s 2010 &quot;Survey on the Living Conditions of Shancheng Bangbang Army&quot; showed that during the most prosperous period, there were approximately 400,000 Bangbangs in Chongqing, of which 3% were women. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;Chongqing Chaotianmen Comprehensive Trading Market is the first stop for most people looking for work.

(Zheng Cailin/Picture)&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Poet Fu Wei once described it this way: In Chongqing, when your friends are drunk, you can ask a stick to carry them back; for your girlfriend’s birthday, You can ask a group of Bangbangs to send flowers and sing a &quot;Happy Birthday&quot; song; if your pet encounters misfortune, you can ask Bangbangs to help cry...&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left ;&quot;>;Although they can make money, Bangbang people live frugally. Ms. Liu and her husband have run the only clinic on Chaodong Road for more than 30 years. In Liu’s impression, it was rare for Bangbang to come to see a doctor. Even if he did come, he would always prescribe some medicine for headaches and fever. “They were reluctant to pay for it. I prescribed a pack of Acafol powder for 10 cents, and he asked me if it could be cheaper. &quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“The boss likes to find male bangbangs”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Female bangbangs are not popular in Chaotianmen. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Gao Zongqi said that Huang Xiuli has a graceful appearance and does not look like a physical worker. There is no market for such a girl in Chaotianmen Bangbang. Once a boss thought she was a girl and couldn&#39;t afford the work, so Huang Xiuli would talk back: &quot;I can&#39;t afford it without paying!&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;I can afford it.&quot; So what if you get up? You will be Bangbang for the rest of your life, and I will be the boss for the rest of your life.&quot; The sharp-tongued Huang Xiuli shut up when she heard this. Bangbang, who sells his strength, is inseparable from the boss&#39;s choice. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;The boss likes to find men to bang.&quot; In this industry, physical strength means money. In the Chaotianmen Wholesale Market, bulk goods shopping malls prefer men with physical strength. &quot;They can earn more than 50 per cart, and I earn 30 per order, which is very little.&quot; Hard work can make up for weakness, so Huang Xiuli only has to make a few more trips. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Gao Zongqi was very envious of men who could carry toys. &quot;With a lot of money, he could carry my shoes three times in one trip.&quot; She came to Chaotian in 1998. Gate, the new Chongqing Chaotianmen International Shoe Center opposite Huang Xiuli carries goods. Gao Zongqi also discussed it with his boss, but the boss still asked Nan Bangbang next time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Gao Zongqi was not discouraged and packed his shoes honestly, &quot;Their men are too stupid to do such a delicate job.&quot; Every time he learned the amount to be packed, Gao Zongqi began to think about how to put the shoe boxes into the box as much as possible horizontally and vertically. If the stuffing is tight, it will affect the presentation; if the stuffing is wide, the top of the box cannot be sealed with glue, and another box may be wasted. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The steps of Gao Zongqi&#39;s packing are like putting on makeup: first apply a base layer horizontally, then change the angle of the second layer to apply it over a large area, and finally apply it like filling acne pits , insert a few small shoe boxes into every slot, and finally seal them with glue and tie them. Gao Zongqi raised his &quot;knife&quot; and cut the packing rope in two. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Hands are easier to use than knives, but the speed must be fast, otherwise there will be blood.&quot; Gao Zongqi, who has been a &quot;bat player&quot; for 25 years, can always find the rope quickly The bifurcation point, quickly pull it off. After years of repeated movements, a groove appeared on the joint of Gao Zongqi&#39;s index finger. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;After the last step of packaging is completed, Gao Zongqi is also responsible for &quot;after-sales&quot;, placing the remaining shoes of the shop owner, picking up the garbage, and then pulling the goods to Opposite the inn. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;Gao Zongqi and her husband pack shoes together.

When they first came to Chaotianmen, Huang Xiuli and Lao Gao rented a house. On the first day they moved in, Bangbang, a man who lived across the street, saw Huang Xiuli and blurted out: &quot;What a good girl!&quot; and wanted to slap her butt. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Bah! Even if I&#39;m not married, I won&#39;t be friends with you.

If you try to trick me later, I will trick you first.&quot; Huang Xiuli usually has a quiet voice. It&#39;s big, but sharp and harsh. If it&#39;s a little higher, it can scare a table of men. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;The biggest fear is not being able to deliver the goods&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;No matter how difficult it is , Huang Xiuli never thought about quitting Bangbang, but it could not stop the industry from declining. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;She remembers clearly that after the Wenchuan earthquake in 2008, the Chaotianmen business was abandoned. “Many people were from Sichuan and Chongqing and went home. Everyone has no intention of making money anymore, their lives are at stake.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The &quot;aftershocks&quot; were delayed until 2010. Chaotianmen Wholesale Market was facing upgrading and comprehensive renovation, and many merchants had the idea of ​​​​moving out of Chaotianmen. &quot;Outside business has been abandoned, and fewer people are coming to buy goods.&quot; Liu Youtou recalled. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;With the rise of logistics companies, the competition in the door-to-door express delivery service industry is intensifying. In addition, Chongqing’s rail transit is accessible in all directions and private cars are booming. It seems that everyone is competing for the &quot;Bang Bang&quot; rice bowl&quot;. There are fewer and fewer sticks carrying bamboo sticks on their shoulders and wandering the streets asking for work. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In 2021, a survey on the living conditions of Bangbang in Chongqing released by the School of Journalism and Communication of Northwest University for Nationalities estimated that the number of Bangbangs in Chongqing has been less than 2,000, and most of them are elderly.

In order to occupy a place in the mall, Huang Xiuli also needs to pay 2,000 yuan &quot;land fee&quot; to the mall every year - occupying a 7-square-meter plot of 15 tiles, where Huang Xiuli&#39;s son sits and waits for his mother in his free time.

In previous years, it was also the golden period for Bangbang people to make money. But this year, there were no cargo loads after two or three days.

Liu Youtou also made up his mind to return to his hometown. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Peng Li is still sitting on the small bench by the roadside, but now she can only issue freight orders of more than 2,000 yuan a day. Huang Xiuli often secretly picks up corrugated cardboard when she gets off work. Gao Zongqi still sits at Chaotianmen International Shoes Co., Ltd. waiting for goods at 6 o&#39;clock every day, and his breakfast has changed from two buds to one. &quot;If you don&#39;t have money to earn, don&#39;t eat in vain.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;There are fewer sticks, and there are even fewer female sticks. Southern Weekend visited and found that there are currently 8 female baseball players in Chaotianmen, 4 of whom are responsible for shoes in the new Chongqing Chaotianmen International Shoe Store, 1 is moving clothes in the third trading area of ​​the shopping mall, and 3 are mobile On Chaodong Road, it mainly transports foreign goods. There are four women in Sanxia Square, two of whom often wait for goods at the entrance of Chongqing New Century Supermarket, and two of whom follow their husbands everywhere to buy goods. There is a female stick worker at the Caiyuanba Bus Station. She closes her stall in the afternoon during the peak season and returns in the morning during the off-season. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;When asked where the more female fans went and how many female fans there are in the area now, their answers were all &quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot; &quot;&quot;not sure&quot;. In other Bangbang gathering places such as Guanyinqiao, Baiyakou Street, Shibati, etc., Southern Weekend did not find any female Bangbangs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Zhao Dongqiu has already saved enough money for her son&#39;s daughter-in-law, but she still doesn&#39;t want to leave Chaotianmen. Someone once took a fancy to Zhao Dongqiu&#39;s cleverness and asked her to settle accounts, but Zhao Dongqiu declined, &quot;It&#39;s easier to have fun here, and you can blow everyone off (chat)&quot;. Zhao Dongqiu&#39;s goal now is to &quot;get off work&quot; after earning 100 yuan a day. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Huang Xiuli still insists on going out every day to find work. Before going out in the morning, she would put homemade medicinal wine on her feet, believing that her home remedies would be more effective than seeing a doctor. &quot;Life is difficult, but I still hope that life will get better.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(Except for Zhao Dongqiu, all names in the article are pseudonyms)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>; https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a >;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 28 Oct 2023 18:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[陷入“以貌取人”困境的普通人]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259503]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-28 17:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;Weight, height, skin color, appearance... not only celebrities in the entertainment industry, but also ordinary people are increasingly falling into In anxiety about appearance.

It was raining lightly in the early morning. Director Wei Shujun thanked everyone for coming to watch the movie before the movie started. He said that it was also raining in the first scene of the movie. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/92420c0a65a420316ddf9fdfdb6c6732.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;658&quot; height=&quot;923&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/92420c0a65a420316ddf9fdfdb6c6732.png&quot; data-key=&quot;255188&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The opening rain scene of the film takes us back to the southern town in the 1990s. The cold weather, dilapidated buildings, dim light, and cramped alleys, the space presented in the film The texture is distant yet familiar. A series of bizarre murder cases lead the pursuers of the truth into the abyss of madness. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;As a shortlisted film in this year&#39;s Cannes &quot;Un Certain Regard&quot; section, &quot;The Mistake by the River&quot; scored a high score of 3.5 points in the Cannes program&lt;/span>;&lt; span>;. As the opening film of the just-concluded Pingyao International Film Festival, this film once again received high praise from many film critics. &lt;span>;Since the short film &quot;Yanbian Boy&quot; debuted in Cannes in 2018, in just 5 years, every feature film directed by Wei Shujun has been favored by Cannes. Such excellent results are rare among the post-90s generation of directors. Its right. &lt;/span>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Wei Shujun’s first two works, &quot;The Parting of the Wild Horse&#39;s Mane&quot; and &quot;Stories of Yong&#39;an Town&quot;, have a very obvious personal color, not only in terms of plot, but also in the story. This kind of personal experience narration also includes a preference for meta-film narrative. Cannes&#39; favor is undoubtedly a recognition of Wei Shujun&#39;s creative talent and potential, but these two previous works are still young and immature. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/076b56ce199a61d4ff049d4328a9f286.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;725&quot; height=&quot;321&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/076b56ce199a61d4ff049d4328a9f286.png&quot; data-key=&quot;255186 &quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The &quot;Mistake by the River&quot; shows a self-contained temperament, marking Wei Shujun&#39;s maturity in creation. Of course, on the one hand, this is due to the original novels with more humanistic value and interpretation space provided by Yu Hua. On the other hand, it is also the more professional and skilled performance of the creative team under the control of industrialization and commerciality. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/bdd362b284cc8f585bda60da8f8bef25.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/bdd362b284cc8f585bda60da8f8bef25.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;255185 &quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;&quot;The Mistake by the River&quot; is a pioneering experimental novella, published in 1988, and is Yu Hua&#39;s early work. Yu Hua mentioned in the interview that Lu Xiaoya and Zhang Yimou both wanted to adapt this work, but neither of them came to fruition, which proves the difficulty of adapting this novel into a movie. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;When describing the creative process of &quot;Alive&quot;, Wang Bin mentioned that the first thing he recommended to Zhang Yimou was &quot;The Mistake by the River&quot; by Yu Hua. At that time, &quot;Alive&quot; Not fully published yet. After reading it, Zhang Yimou worried that the characters in &quot;The Mistake by the River&quot; were too symbolic. In the process of continuous discussion, Zhang Yimou also constructed an almost brand-new story, with more realistic characters and plots, and obviously more Zhang Yimou&#39;s style - this story has a female as the protagonist. It&#39;s just that this idea went nowhere. Zhang Yimou was later completely attracted by &quot;Alive&quot;, thus creating a classic in Chinese film history. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After more than thirty years, in the hands of a younger generation of creators, &quot;The Mistake by the River&quot; has taken on a new glory. Wei Shujun and screenwriter Kang Chunlei&#39;s adaptation has no concerns of the times or historical considerations. Baggage is a bold addition, deletion, disassembly and reconstruction based on the original work. It not only grasps the absurd nature of the original work, but also injects it with an expression that is closer to the current mental state. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/5fe8b80026b408a31f2ac5ae24f08669.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/5fe8b80026b408a31f2ac5ae24f08669.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;255190&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The pursuit of the truth in Yu Hua&#39;s original work is the author&#39;s analysis of madness and civilization during the cultural renaissance wave in the late 1980s. The protagonist Ma Zhe was eventually diagnosed as a &quot;madman&quot;. It is an ironic social naming. In the movie version, as Ma Zhe gradually becomes a madman, he encounters individuals being crushed by authority, the uncertainty of memory, and black humorous coincidences in the process of solving crimes. Near the end of the movie, a change of viewpoint in one shot shows that Ma Zhe has finally become a madman, and is even more proactive than Ma Zhe in the novel. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In that era in my memory, lunatics were common. Some liked to sing in the yard late at night, and some liked to tease others on the street. In today&#39;s era, we almost no longer see lunatics in public places, but more and more people entertain themselves as &quot;mentally ill.&quot; The different understandings of the symptoms of &quot;madman&quot; in the two eras may correspond to the different spiritual cores displayed by the two generations of creators in their treatment of novels and film texts. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/9d3a92c4251420384063fe14d67f7c51.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/9d3a92c4251420384063fe14d67f7c51.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;255189 &quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yu Hua said, &quot;Only fools are loyal to the original work.&quot; The movie &quot;The Mistake by the River&quot; is a smart and successful adaptation. The realistic texture created by Wei Shujun visually highlights the absurdity and the eerie atmosphere that makes people think deeply. The 16mm film shooting gives the film a retro tone, presenting the sense of small town space of that era, with occasional out-of-focus lenses, and even provides a stylistic expression for the theme of uncertainty. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The film&#39;s representation of the people and events in the unit of that era, as well as scenes such as the poetry meeting, is by no means a realistic reproduction. The director uses a slightly exaggerated satire, but more subtly conveys the reality of the times that makes people laugh. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Ma Zhe, played by Zhu Yilong, also provides a wonderful screen image for this retro realistic texture. In order to interpret this role more accurately, Zhu Yilong went to Nanfeng, the filming location, to experience life in advance. He found inspiration for his appearance from an old photo of Yu Hua, and first gained weight and then lost weight for this role. His experiential performance created an amazing character. A convincing image of Ma Zhe. So far, this role is the biggest screen breakthrough for Zhu Yilong, who is still labeled as a traffic star, and will lay the foundation for his future as a big screen actor. In other words, we see one thing from him: acting skills are more important than traffic. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/4d2519bd4e8e9a251834b9bc08856dba.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/4d2519bd4e8e9a251834b9bc08856dba.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;255187&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;&lt;span>;Wei Shujun, who prefers meta-movies, said that &quot;The Mistake by the River&quot; is no longer a meta-movie. &lt;/span>;However, in the film, a movie theater that is about to be demolished is used as the working space for handling the case. The gaze and being gazed created by the camera&#39;s perspective, as well as the presentation of the chaos of dreams and reality, all demonstrate the director&#39;s meta-cinematic interest. . &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Similar to the original work, &quot;The Mistake by the River&quot; has a detective-themed genre shell, but the direction of the plot and the author&#39;s stylized treatment broke the expectations of genre suspense. . Moreover, it also abandons the avant-garde nature of the original work and uses a linear narrative as the main line, but it is by no means in line with the public&#39;s imagination. Therefore, we need to look at the market performance of this movie with caution. But regardless of whether it&#39;s good or bad at the box office, this is a work with a unique temperament. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 28 Oct 2023 16:55:03 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
