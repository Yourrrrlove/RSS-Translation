Local law enforcement said &quot;no drugs were found at the scene and there were no signs of foul play.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The case is still under investigation, and no drugs have been found at the &quot;scene&quot; yet, but this does not mean that there is no drug abuse background in this case. In fact, Matthew has been addicted to alcohol and drugs since the first season of Friends in the mid-1990s. In his memoir &quot;Friends, Lovers and the Big Terrible Thing,&quot; he said: He has been fighting drug addiction his whole life, during which he was near death twice, costing him as much as $9 million (equivalent to 65.85 million yuan). But he was still defeated in the end. At the worst point, he swallowed 55 pills of Vicodin (opioid analgesic) every day and drank 1 liter of vodka. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Very similar to this incident, on February 11, 2012, the 48-year-old American singer Whitney Houston suffered a heart attack due to a drug overdose at the Hilton Hotel in Beverly Hills, Los Angeles. After losing consciousness, he slipped into the bathtub and drowned. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Earlier, on June 25, 2009, American rock star Michael Jackson suffered a heart attack after his personal doctor Conrad Murray injected him with a fatal dose of propofol (a short-acting intravenous anesthetic). die. Prior to this, Jackson also used a large number of painkillers and anesthetics for many years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Under the banner of these big-name celebrities taking drugs, Americans are taking drugs and abusing addictive drugs extremely seriously. According to the classification standards of the National Center on Drug Abuse Statistics, there are eight main types of drugs: alcohol, marijuana, cocaine, heroin, fentanyl, methamphetamine (methamphetamine), opioids (controlled psychotropic substances), and prescription stimulants agent. The United States accounts for less than 5% of the world&#39;s population, but uses 80% of the world&#39;s opioids. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC): Among the approximately 280 million Americans aged 12 and above, there are approximately 31.9 million drug users. On average, 1 in 12 people takes drugs, accounting for 12% of the total number of drug addicts worldwide. On average, about 300 people die from drugs every day. Drug abuse kills 100,000 people every year, of which about 71,000 die from fentanyl abuse. The number of drug deaths is eight times that of Americans who die from gun accidents, far exceeding the number of Americans who die from AIDS, car accidents, and gun accidents. Of the total number of deaths, 70% were men between the ages of 25 and 54. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The 2022 report of the &quot;Joint Economic Committee of the U.S. Congress&quot; pointed out that the abuse of opioids caused nearly 1.5 trillion US dollars in losses to the United States, accounting for about 7% of the GDP that year. In 2022, compared with before the outbreak of the &quot;new crown epidemic&quot;, the United States will lose about 6.3 million labor force, about 20% of which are caused by drug abuse. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;No matter in terms of loss of life, economic loss, social security, moral corruption... the United States has fallen into a large-scale, long-term nationwide &quot;opium crisis.&quot; Unlike the disaster in the late Qing Dynasty from 1840 to 1842, the Americans&#39; &quot;opium crisis&quot; did not involve external force invasion. It was completely directed and acted by them: the youth group is the age group with the fastest growing number of drug addicts and the fastest growing number of deaths in the United States. 18 -The drug abuse rate among people aged 25 years old is 39%; among people aged 26-29 years old, it is 34%; and 70% people who have tried illegal drugs before the age of 13 have a clear trend of drug use at younger ages. This trend shows that traditional American values ​​are collapsing, just as Lee Kuan Yew talked about the dissipation of the &quot;American spirit&quot; in &quot;China and the World&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The former deputy secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said: The current drug and substance abuse in the United States is one of the most devastating public health disasters. This crisis is a reflection of the failure of multi-system supervision by the US government, and urgent, unified and comprehensive response measures are urgently needed. The National Public Radio (NPR) in the United States lamented that &quot;American liberalism&quot; has caused the tragedy of the United States. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;New Liberalism&quot; (New Liberalism), also known as progressivism, which has led to the proliferation of drugs, is an ultra-left ideology. It is diametrically opposed to classical liberalism. The freedom advocated by the latter is the right to act according to one&#39;s own will without interfering with the rights of others. There is no freedom without law. Private property is inviolable and everyone is responsible for their own actions. The freedom it advocates is: behavior without any restrictions and without any consequences, that is, &quot;do whatever you want, do whatever you want&quot;, and it is best for the government or society to pay the bill. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;American liberalism has set off many &quot;progressive&quot; social movements in the West through sexual liberation, sexual indulgence, drug use, decadent literature and art since the 1960s. It has continued for decades to this day, leading to the gradual disintegration of marriages and families, the proliferation of drugs, and rampant crime. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The root cause of the &quot;opium crisis&quot; in the United States is difficult to eradicate. The U.S. police once said: If the strict anti-drug measures of Eastern societies were followed, more than one million drug dealers would have to be executed, all U.S. prisons would be emptied and the capacity would be expanded by ten. times, used for forced detoxification. But this is simply unimaginable in the United States and Western society. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The U.S. Democratic Party government is engaged in &quot;conceptual innovation&quot;: if drug use is legalized and it is not considered a crime, then won&#39;t the drug-related crime rate drop? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First of all, drugs are divided into &quot;hard drugs&quot; and &quot;soft drugs&quot;. Those with slightly less addictive and harmful effects, such as marijuana, are allowed to be used legally (for medical purposes) in 31 states in the United States. ), 10 states allow legal recreational use of marijuana. Then, Oregon passed &quot;Bill 110&quot; and became the first state in the United States to decriminalize the possession of &quot;hard drugs&quot; such as heroin, methamphetamine, and cocaine: possession of less than 1 gram of heroin, ecstasy, and less than 2 grams Cocaine, methamphetamine, less than 12 grams of psilocybin, less than 40 doses of hallucinogens, oxycodone, etc. will no longer be considered crimes and will instead be punished by a $100 fine or a health evaluation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This concept innovation has &quot;remarkable results.&quot; The US &quot;Capitol Hill&quot; reported on August 28, 2022: A Gallup poll showed that the number of Americans smoking marijuana hit a record high, surpassing smoking for the first time. Number of people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to the phased strategy of &quot;hard drugs&quot; and &quot;soft drugs&quot;, the US pharmaceutical industry has also launched an &quot;opioid (opium) prescription drug&quot; strategy. Hill, director of the Robber Drug Rehabilitation Center in Ohio, believes that compared to other countries, Americans are more likely to choose drugs to relieve pain and release stress. The main driving force that contributed to the formation of this social culture was the &quot;most generous marketing campaign in pharmaceutical history&quot; that large American pharmaceutical companies invested heavily in in the mid-1990s. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The most typical one is that in 1995, the American &quot;Purdue Pharma&quot; promoted Oxycontin (OxyContin) developed by it and took the lead in launching the &quot;opioid harmless theory&quot; propaganda campaign. After its launch, Within six years, Purdue sponsored 20,000 missionary projects. Opioid manufacturers and distributors spent $880 million over 10 years on marketing advertising. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Opioid drugs greatly reduce the content of opium derivatives, and drug users take countermeasures to increase the amount of drugs they take. For example, Matthew, mentioned above, once swallowed 55 opioid analgesics every day, taking drugs in a &quot;curve&quot; way according to legal prescriptions prescribed by doctors. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The deep-seated social problems caused by drugs include: drugs cause damage to the brain nerves of drug users, cause psychological abnormalities and cognitive impairment, induce mental illness, aggravate emotional agitation, lead to family crises, violent crimes, Problems such as psychological trauma in children; violent disasters such as gang crimes and homicides caused by drug trafficking affect social stability and generate upstream and downstream crimes such as money laundering. At the social level, the proliferation of drugs has reduced the labor base of American society and affected the average life expectancy of the American population; at the spiritual level, drugs and the crimes they induce have destroyed traditional values, annihilated justice and conscience, destroyed morality, and unleashed the worst evil in human nature. A devastating crime that breaks down society, shakes the foundation of the country, and destroys the spiritual and ideological foundation of future generations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;opium crisis&quot; in the United States has become difficult to recover from and will continue for a long time. The proliferation of drugs has become a chronic disease that is deeply hated by traditional groups in American society, but it is difficult to truly eradicate it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 06 Nov 2023 08:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[被诬偷拍的人，不可逆转的伤害]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260001]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-05 23:03:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;On November 3, the &quot;Chengdu Subway Framed and Hidden Photography Case&quot; opened for trial.

Just like Zweig described his father&#39;s generation, a generation blinded by idealism holds optimistic illusions, firmly believes that tolerance and friendship are indispensable binding forces, and sincerely believes that the boundaries and beliefs between various countries and sects are Differences will gradually be resolved through people&#39;s friendship, and the entire human race will enjoy the most precious wealth: peace and security. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For various reasons, I have to face all kinds of people in my work and life, understand all kinds of ideas, communicate, get close, understand, and explain. And as my colleague M described it, I often want to &quot;withdraw from human society immediately.&quot; At this time, I will choose some topics that have nothing to do with humans, animals or plants, rivers or mountains. Whether elephants run away or floods occur, whether glaciers melt or forest fires occur, these all reflect the insignificance and stupidity of human beings, as well as their concession and self-rescue. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This was the original motivation for me to report on the scientific research on Mount Everest and the melting of glaciers. Simply put, even Mount Everest can detect DDT (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: italics, italics_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Organochlorine pesticides&lt;/span>;), even the East Rongbuk Glacier. After losing ground, shouldn&#39;t humans put aside their prejudices and differences for the Himalayas, a young mountain range that spans five countries, and trust and cooperate with each other? Indeed, in interviews, glacier researchers generally view the world as one. Facing nature and the universe, disputes and conflicts lose their meaning. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although, global warming is not only about the environment, but also about fairness. The most vulnerable people and ecosystems have been disproportionately affected by loss and damage and are suffering from the adverse impacts of climate change that are disproportionate to their responsibility. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Just like the debate on &quot;rewriting literary history&quot; and the humanistic spirit in the 1980s and 1990s, the intention to strip away one&#39;s stance in literature is a stance, and the intention is to transcend conscious biases to record scientific work. Perhaps It is a conscious choice in itself. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In interviews in Lanzhou and Tibet, what unfolded before me was an open world, the endless treasure of the Creator. These scientists who are engaged in glacier research in western China love field scientific research, partly because they love freedom and pursue a free and unrestrained life. They can endure the hardship of being stationed at the foot of Mount Everest for ten years. This is because they are not stingy with their time and can feel the pulse of the earth. And the magnificent luck of Mount Everest. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There was an interview in the evening. We were sitting on the playground of Lanzhou University. The interviewee told me that sometimes I sympathize with you big city people. With so much pressure, you will never be able to get out of the reinforced concrete city. forest. I suddenly thought of the birth of Impressionism: urbanites who experienced the industrial revolution began to dislike London, which was filled with industrial smog, and yearned for the countryside and nature. Later, born out of Impressionism, freer Fauvism, Cubism, and Expressionism were born. China has also completed its industrial revolution. Do Chinese people today also yearn for nature and countryside? Longing to leave the conflicts and struggles in the small environment or the big environment? Will this give rise to new cultural forms? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Back to concerns about global warming and glacier melting. The guilt I feel is that some people who study glaciers and sense the pulse of the earth have scientifically proven that human activities have severely harmed the environment. It seems that they are not concerned about environmental changes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But recently, I read an exposition of Jin Guowei’s creation and felt somewhat comforted and even self-consistent. He is a world-renowned documentary director for his films such as &quot;Free Climbing&quot; and &quot;Thailand Cave Rescue&quot;. He said: &quot;I like to photograph the positive side of human nature, the qualities that can inspire us to become better. I have many friends who photograph human nature. The other side of the world is war, conflict, controversy. Obviously, I have not made a work on this theme. There are so many discouraging things happening in the world, which make people sad and angry. I hope to try to make something that can be related to I think this is the contribution I can make to the world.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 05 Nov 2023 22:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[自家院子聚餐要办证？行政执法别乱来丨快评]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260013]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-05 21:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Recently, a video of a law enforcement officer in Hua County, Henan Province saying that a certificate is required to set up a fire party in rural areas has attracted great attention. The Huaxian Municipal Supervision Bureau issued a situation report on November 1, saying that law enforcement officers did not interpret the policy in a standardized manner, causing misunderstandings, and suspended them. However, this report was vague about the nature of the incident, which aroused greater doubts among netizens. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to netizens, they were preparing to have a dinner in their yard when several law enforcement officers suddenly arrived. In the video, a uniformed staff member said, &quot;As long as you set up a fire, it is considered a business. If you have a group dinner, you must apply for a food safety license and a food business license. If you do not apply, you will be fined.&quot; Faced with doubts from netizens, law enforcement officers Take out a copy of the Food Safety Law and indicate that there is a legal basis for requesting a certificate. This aroused great doubts among netizens. Many people commented under the video: &quot;Do I need a permit to cook at home?&quot; &quot;I invited some relatives to my house for dinner a few days ago and didn&#39;t apply for a permit. Is it illegal?&quot; &quot; I plan to invite a few friends to my home for dinner in the next few days. Where can I apply for a certificate?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After becoming a hot spot on the Internet, the Huaxian Municipal Supervision Bureau reported that on October 17, the bureau received a report that a certain village There was a dinner party in a courtyard. After the law enforcement officers arrived at the scene, they &quot;found that this was not a normal wedding and wedding gathering in rural areas. Five people were preparing dishes and cleaning tableware on the scene. The processing environment was simple and open-air. There were no &#39;three prevention&#39; facilities. The operators did not hold valid health certificates. There were Serious safety hazards can easily lead to food safety incidents and endanger people&#39;s health. Law enforcement officers explained relevant laws and regulations to the above-mentioned personnel and persuaded them to stop processing behaviors.&quot; &quot;During the law enforcement process, law enforcement officers did not interpret the policy in a standardized manner, which caused The masses misunderstood. The comrade was ordered to make an in-depth inspection and be suspended from duty.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To be honest, this announcement is confusing. The previous paragraph seems to say that law enforcement is no problem. It’s just that law enforcement officers’ interpretation of the policy is not standardized enough. If that&#39;s the case, it&#39;s just a small mistake and doesn&#39;t warrant suspension, right? Just criticize and educate, and then learn standardized policy interpretations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But if I read the first paragraph carefully, the more I read, the more confused I become. The scene was &quot;not a normal wedding and wedding gathering.&quot; What kind of dinner was that? Is it normal to gather for weddings and weddings, but is it abnormal to gather for other gatherings? Do we need a certificate for “normal” weddings and weddings? Or is it only needed for “abnormal” dinner parties? What kind of dinner party is this? How many people are at the dinner party? Are the five people preparing food on site also part of the party, or are they the chefs they hired? The answers to these questions are different, and the nature of the events may be completely different. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If this is just a dinner party between family and friends, and the person preparing the food is also part of the dinner party, then there is absolutely no reason for the so-called law enforcement. If you have a dinner party with relatives and friends and cook and eat by yourself, do you need to apply for a food safety certificate or food business license? Of course not. There is no such provision in any law. The so-called &quot;simple processing environment, open-air operation, no &#39;three prevention&#39; facilities, and operators without valid health certificates&quot; and so on do not violate any laws. Rural gatherings, no matter whether they are weddings, weddings or other reasons, if there are many people, it is common for the host to cook in the open air in his own yard. The host is too busy, so relatives and friends help out. Do we still need relatives and friends to provide health certificates? As long as your relatives don&#39;t dislike it, the regulatory authorities have no reason to intervene. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is also possible that the person preparing the food is a chef specially hired by the host. For events with large gatherings of people, it is very common in some rural areas to hire professional chefs to serve at your doorstep. These chefs generally have a fixed team and provide mobile services in neighboring villages and charge service fees. This is indeed a commercial catering service, and it seems that the relevant personnel are required to apply for health certificates, food business licenses, etc. There are laws to follow. But the problem is that the food business licensing regulations formulated by the former State Administration of Food and Drug Administration require &quot;one license for one place&quot;, which means that to conduct food business in one place, you must obtain a license. For mobile catering services, this requirement is difficult to achieve. It is impossible to go to the regulatory authorities in advance to apply for a license every time you serve a place. Not to mention that it is difficult for these temporary venues to meet the conditions stipulated in licensing regulations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some people say that it may be managed as a food vendor. The Food Safety Law has relatively loose provisions on small food production and processing workshops and food vendors, and authorizes provincial governments to formulate specific management measures. However, in the &quot;Henan Provincial Small Food Workshops, Small Business Stores and Small Stalls Management Regulations&quot; passed by the Henan Provincial People&#39;s Congress in 2017, small food workshops and small business stores are required to have fixed production and business premises. Although small food stalls do not have fixed stores, they Stalls must also be set up at approved locations and within the specified time. Therefore, this regulation does not apply to mobile door-to-door catering services. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What should we do if there are no clear regulations to follow? Based on the abstract provision in the Food Safety Law that &quot;people engaged in food production, food sales, and catering services must obtain a license in accordance with the law,&quot; teams that provide mobile catering services are forced to apply for a license, and then they are refused and banned on the grounds that they do not meet the license conditions. , or should we follow the principle of modesty in administrative law enforcement and intervene as little as possible when there is no clear legal basis to rely on? The right choice should be self-evident. After all, rural areas are not full of restaurants like cities. Some places may be more than ten miles away from restaurants in towns, and transportation is not that convenient. It is unrealistic to travel across mountains and rivers to eat after finishing errands. Ignoring the actual needs of the rural public and using mechanical enforcement will only drive this market underground. Regulatory authorities should provide more services and less &quot;enforcement&quot;, and especially should not threaten fines at every turn. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 05 Nov 2023 21:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[深秋川西：最美季节，斑斓画卷]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259992]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-05 20:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 05 Nov 2023 20:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[首位博士说丨葛剑雄：不要指望通过玩来学历史]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260009]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-05 18:30:06&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 11/05/kEzg0k24CbQPfWdjHliBiwF8uZki3OYbTjMcSGYG.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/05/kEzg0k24CbQPfWdjHliBiwF8u Zki3OYbTjMcSGYG. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;257126&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On October 6, 2023, Ge Jianxiong was in a bookstore on Daxue Road, Shanghai&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern Weekend reporter Wei Cuicui/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Doctoral profile:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Ge Jianxiong , the first doctor of history in New China (tied with Zhou Zhenhe). &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;On December 15, 1945, he was born in Nanxun Town, Wuxing County, Zhejiang Province (now Nanxun District, Huzhou City). &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;September 1957-July 1960, studied in junior high school at Chang&#39;an Middle School in Shanghai. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;From September 1960 to July 1964, he attended high school at Shibei Middle School in Shanghai, during which he took a year and a half of sick leave. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;September 1964-July 1965, teacher training class of Shanghai Institute of Education, internship at Shibei Middle School. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;From August 1965 to September 1978, he served as a teacher and secretary of the Youth League Committee of Gutian Middle School in Shanghai. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;From October 1978 to November 1981, he was a graduate student in the History Department of Fudan University, studying under Mr. Tan Qixiang, and received his master&#39;s degree. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;In December 1981, he stayed at the school to work. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;In March 1982, he was an on-the-job doctoral candidate at the Institute of Chinese History and Geography at Fudan University, tutored by Professor Tan Qixiang. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;In June 1983, he graduated early with the approval of the Ministry of Education.

Ge Jianxiong, who was among them, also felt the vigorous vitality. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Returning to college is not easy. In December 1945, Ge Jianxiong was born in Nanxun Town, Wuxing, Zhejiang. He hoped to apply for the classical literature major at Peking University, but he was diagnosed with lung disease during a physical examination in his second year of high school, and his studies were forced to interrupt. After losing the chance to take the college entrance examination twice in a row, he followed the teacher&#39;s advice and began training for teaching qualifications while preparing to take the college entrance examination. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In August 1965, Ge Jianxiong officially became an English teacher at Shanghai Gutian Middle School. He thought he would be able to enter college after his health recovered, but instead he received news that the university had suspended admissions. Ge Jianxiong has spent more than ten years teaching at Gutian Middle School. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The college entrance examination was resumed in 1977, and the age limit for taking the exam was 30 years old. The 31-year-old Ge Jianxiong was not eligible to take the exam. In 1978, graduate student enrollment was resumed and the age limit was relaxed to 40 years old, allowing Ge Jianxiong to quietly sign up. With a high school education, he was admitted to the History Department of Fudan University with the first score in the preliminary examination, and studied historical geography under Mr. Tan Qixiang. A few years later, by chance, Ge Jianxiong and his fellow student Zhou Zhenhe became the first two PhDs in history independently trained by China after the reform and opening up. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ge Jianxiong often mentioned Mr. Tan Qixiang’s ingenious metaphor about historical geography: If history is a drama, then geography is the stage, and history cannot work without this stage. Mentioning the relevance of this subject to ordinary people, Ge Jianxiong said that historical geography is omnipresent. &quot;Whether it is the changes in the natural environment or the development of human geography, such as today&#39;s folk customs and intangible cultural heritage, they are all products of the historical geographical environment.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for the reason why he entered historical geography, Ge Jianxiong explained that even if he liked history since childhood, it was just a manifestation of blind curiosity in his youth until he became a graduate student at Fudan University in October 1978 and stayed at the school to work three years later. , only then decided to take historical geography as a lifelong career. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ge Jianxiong is also a scholar with quite a personality. He often said, &quot;Don&#39;t be a nerd, don&#39;t be a hypocrite.&quot; Whether as a scholar or a member of the CPPCC, he always expressed his views outspokenly. In addition, he has traveled to Antarctica as a member of China&#39;s 17th Antarctic Expedition, climbed Mount Kilimanjaro, the &quot;King of Africa&quot;, and visited Ali, Tibet, the &quot;Roof of the World&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the last day of the National Day holiday in 2023, a Southern Weekend reporter met Ge Jianxiong in a bookstore on University Road in Shanghai. The 77-year-old man has gray hair and a slight stoop. He is wearing a dark blue cotton and linen shirt and dark gray trousers. He is carrying a white canvas bag filled with documents and books. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Missed the college entrance examination&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti; &quot;>;You once mentioned that you were unable to take the college entrance examination due to physical reasons in high school. What was the situation like at that time? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Ge Jianxiong:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;My goal in high school was to major in classical literature at Peking University, but I was diagnosed with lung disease in May of my second semester of high school. Due to widespread malnutrition, three people in our class were diagnosed with lung disease. My condition was the most serious and I had to suspend school. I originally thought that I would be able to start my senior year of high school in time after taking a three-month break, but after an examination, I found that the lesions were not completely absorbed, so I ended up taking a year and a half out of school and studying with the next class in my senior year of high school. In May 1964, I still failed the physical examination for the college entrance examination and was unable to register. Under such circumstances, I could only work as a social youth, but my teacher suggested that I join the workforce. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;What work have you done and what do you hope for the future? Planning? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Ge Jianxiong:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Shanghai Institute of Education was running a teaching qualification training course at that time, which was equivalent to a one-year college. We were sent to various key schools to receive training, and after one year we were officially assigned as teachers. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At that time, I planned to become a teacher first, and wait until I recovered before taking the college entrance examination. I trained at my alma mater, Shibei Middle School. I like literature and history, and I wanted to teach Chinese. But the teacher in charge of my class was the Chinese teacher. He said that the Chinese teacher had to correct the compositions of two classes and the burden was too heavy. He knew that I planned to enter college and suggested that I teach English so that I could have more spare time for self-study. After one year of internship, on August 5, 1965, I reported to Gutian Middle School and officially became a teacher. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;What other preparations have you made for the college entrance examination? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Ge Jianxiong: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Not long after I started working, in September 1965, the night school department of Shanghai International Studies University enrolled students, and I applied. Starting from October of that year, we had English classes two nights a week. I thought I would have the opportunity to enter university after working for two years, but when the Cultural Revolution began in 1966 and the university closed down, my hope was dashed. The university resumed enrollment in 1977, but the age requirement was 30 years old. I was over the age and had no chance. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Applying for graduate school with a high school degree, similar exceptions are available for admission Was it common at the time? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Ge Jianxiong:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;When the country resumed postgraduate enrollment, the &quot;People&#39;s Daily&quot; published an article proposing to reduce talents in any way. Many regulations have been broken. For example, a high school diploma is required to enter college, but nothing is required to enter graduate school. The age is also relaxed to 40 years old. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It was reported in the news at that time that some people graduated from elementary school and were admitted to graduate school. There was also a Shandong student who had studied with his father since he was a child and had never set foot on campus and was admitted to graduate school. The oldest among the first batch of graduate students was Qian Liqun, who was born in 1939, and the youngest recruited by Fudan was born in 1957. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You originally wanted to study classical philology, but why did you apply for Fudan University? Historical geography? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Ge Jianxiong:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I got married in March 1978 and registered for the exam in May or June. My wife wanted me to stay in Shanghai. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I really wanted to study classical philology when I was in high school, but later I found that history was more practical and safer. I didn’t know what historical geography was at first, but I liked both history and geography, so I applied for this subject. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Did the application process go smoothly? What was your mentality at the time? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Ge Jianxiong:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I prepared quietly for the first test and did not dare to tell the employer. I don&#39;t place any hope on the exam. If I can pass it, I will take it. If I fail, I won&#39;t be ashamed. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The examination room was at Shanghai Institute of Technology, which is now the Yanchang Road campus of Shanghai University, two or three kilometers away from Gutian Middle School. At eight o&#39;clock in the morning, I organized the flag-raising on the school radio and lectured the students. It took about a quarter of an hour to complete these tasks, and then I rode a bicycle for ten minutes to take the exam. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the preliminary test results came out, I ranked first. Only after I was able to take the re-examination did I start preparing seriously. I went to the public reading room of the Shanghai Library to borrow professional reference books, such as &quot;Selected Readings of Ancient Chinese Geography Classics&quot;. At that time, there was only one copy. It had been borrowed when I went there on the first day. I went to borrow it very early the next day to get it. , and it was also at this time that I met the classmates who later re-examined together. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But in fact, middle school has known it for a long time. After I enrolled in the school, the old branch secretary of the school accidentally told me that after seeing the preliminary test scores, Fudan University suspected that I had falsified my high school diploma and had sent someone to Gutian Middle School to learn about the situation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You had been working at Gutian Middle School for more than ten years when you were admitted to graduate school. Did you Are you still worried that the school won’t let you go? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Ge Jianxiong: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Yes. I was responsible for student affairs at the school and also served as the full-time Youth League Committee Secretary. I introduced the first batch of League members in the school. In 1977, I was selected as an advanced worker in education in Shanghai, and later became a deputy to the Shanghai Municipal People’s Congress. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the leaders of the Zhabei District Education Bureau specifically called the school to express their attitude - if I am admitted to graduate school, it means that the country needs me to go to graduate school more, and the school must release me unconditionally. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/05/8CTAl7WVPMKw6hkp1USDjvszLxnrwA6urOi61djs.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;614&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/05/8CTAl7WVPMKw6hkp1USDjvszLxnrwA6urOi61djs.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;257127&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In October 1983, President Xie Xide of Fudan University (left) awarded Ge Jianxiong a doctorate degree. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of interviewee)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Exceptional award of doctorate degree&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;October 1978 was the time you entered school.

After the plenary session, the big-character posters were removed, scar literature caused heated debates among students, and more and more lectures were given. Some students proposed improving the treatment of intellectuals. While the views they put forward were not necessarily mainstream, they were passionate. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Deng Xiaoping’s speech proposed that it must be ensured that scientific and technological personnel must spend at least five-sixths of their time in business work a week. Our political study time has been significantly reduced, to half a day a week. In the past, we would have meetings and study all day long, and individuals had to attend. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;What are the course arrangements after enrollment? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Ge Jianxiong: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;During the master’s period, the school offers public courses, including politics and foreign languages. I chose English, German and Japanese. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Mr. Tan offers professional courses. When he enrolled, Mr. Tan was still hospitalized. He gave us the first class in the foyer of Shanghai Longhua Hospital. After two lectures, I thought the foyer was too noisy. Mr. Tan happened to have a student working at the Shanghai Dictionary Publishing House, so he asked someone to find a house for the publishing house near Longhua Hospital. In this way, Mr. Tan gave us a semester of professional courses. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The school does not offer other professional courses and requires tutors and departments to resolve the issues themselves. Most of the courses are offered by tutors. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We have geography internships starting from this year. In 1979, two teachers took five of us graduate students to Yangzhou, Zhenjiang and Nanjing to conduct formal &quot;academic mountain climbing&quot; and observe geological structures. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You chose to stay in school after graduation and started working and studying at the same time Bo, what&#39;s the opportunity in this? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Ge Jianxiong: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;After I graduated with my master&#39;s degree, I was assigned a job. My family is in Shanghai, so I stayed in school smoothly, serving as Mr. Tan&#39;s assistant and undertaking scientific research tasks. In the spring of 1982, the country began to officially recruit doctoral students. At that time, doctoral supervisors had to go to Beijing for evaluation. It was not until 1992 that Peking University, Tsinghua, Fudan and other universities could evaluate at their own school, and they had to report to the Ministry of Education for registration. After Mr. Tan was named a doctoral supervisor in 1981, he recruited Zhou Zhenhe and me in 1982. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the whole, the number of doctoral students recruited in the first batch is very small, with only a dozen or so in the Liberal Arts Department of Fudan University. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;As the first batch of Ph.D.s, what is your training method? Is there a relatively clear training plan? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Ge Jianxiong: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;There is no standardized training method, and I don’t know what the above requirements are. After discussing with us, Mr. Tan decided to study on his own first and ask him for advice if he had any questions. Since I am his assistant and follow him all day long, I can ask for advice at any time. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Because the number of doctoral students is small, the school does not offer courses specifically for doctoral students, so we don’t know what courses are available. However, considering that there is a thesis requirement for doctoral graduation, we began to prepare the doctoral thesis shortly after the semester started in 1982. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;In September 1983, after more than a year of doctoral studies, you and Zhou Zhenhe was specially approved by the Ministry of Education to graduate early, which seems incredible today. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Ge Jianxiong:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;In May 1983, the first batch of Ph.D.s in science appeared in China. The evaluation is based on the master&#39;s thesis, and if it reaches the doctoral level, it can be recognized as a doctorate. At that time, 18 people from across the country passed, and 4 from Fudan, namely Hong Jiaxing, Zhang Yinnan, Tong Yusun and Li Shaokuan. At the meeting of the school’s academic degree committee, Mr. Tan asked whether Zhou Zhenhe’s and I’s papers could also be recognized as doctoral thesis because they were also of high quality. However, Principal Su Buqing objected. He believed that the expressions of science subjects such as mathematics and physics have international standards, while liberal arts are Chinese subjects and have no international standards. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At that time, the school already had the first batch of science Ph.D.s, but no liberal arts Ph.D.s. If you wanted to strengthen your strength, this was an entry point. Jiang Yihua, the then department chair, learned that Tsinghua University and Peking University did not yet have liberal arts PhDs, so he asked whether Fudan could strive to cultivate the first batch of liberal arts PhDs in China. They specifically approached the Vice Minister of Education Huang Xinbai, and the result was that exceptions could be made, but all courses must meet the standards. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;How do you meet the standards required by the Ministry of Education? No twists and turns? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Ge Jianxiong:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Zhou Zhenhe and I completed the closed-book politics exam. For professional courses, Mr. Tan prepared test papers based on our situation. In addition, foreign language scores are also required. Zhou Zhenhe and I both took English and Japanese during our master&#39;s degrees, and our Japanese scores were over 80 points. We proposed that the first foreign language test be English, and the second foreign language should be replaced by the Japanese scores during the master&#39;s degree. The Ministry of Education agreed. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For the thesis defense in August 1983, we invited Hou Renzhi and Shi Nianhai. However, after the defense date was set, the written approval from the Ministry of Education for our early graduation has not yet been issued. When the school learned that Huang Xinbai was having a meeting in Harbin, it sent someone to Harbin to find him to sign. The night before the defense, they made a long-distance call and said that our defense was &quot;legal&quot; only after Huang Xinbai approved it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The degree awarding ceremony will be held in September. At that time, the doctoral certificates were numbered nationwide. The first 18 numbers were for science. Zhou Zhenhe was numbered 19th and I was numbered 20th. With a clear conscience, although we graduated early as an exception, we did not take things lightly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is another episode. We were supposed to have professional titles after graduation, but due to the rectification of professional titles, it was not until 1985 that the assessment of professional titles was resumed, and Zhou Zhenhe and I were promoted to associate professors. I was named a professor in 1991 and became a doctoral supervisor in 1993. From the time I was studying for a Ph.D. to becoming a professor, I was able to continue doing academic work. If not for the reform and opening up, I would never have had these opportunities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/05/5gv0PjMm2R0vUVItxmyHEVQp06V6hOrmR2hxAVs3.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;698&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/05/5gv0PjMm2R0vUVItxmyHEVQp06V6hOrmR2hxAVs3.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;257128&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In May 1981, Ge Jianxiong (3rd from left) and his mentor Tan Qixiang (2nd from left), Zhou Youguang (1st from right) and Zhang Yunhe (1st from left). &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of interviewee)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;How come toys must make you lose your mind? &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You often mentioned Mr. Tan’s opinions on acting and The metaphor of a stage, so what is the value and significance behind studying the stage where history takes place? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Ge Jianxiong:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Historical geography is the study of geographical conditions in historical periods, including natural topography such as mountains, rivers, and humanities, Such as politics, economy and culture. The stage is an abstract metaphor, which actually refers to all geographical conditions, geographical elements and geographical distribution in the past. The value behind it lies in how we apply it.

But for a subject to become a knowledge, at least there must be people studying the basic fields. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When the Fudan University Library was organizing its centenary exhibition, it asked me for a topic, and it was finally decided to be &quot;The Legend of the End of the Fire&quot;. I took out a few exhibits. The first one is Mr. Tan&#39;s university graduation thesis - &quot;History of Chinese Immigration&quot;. His instructor was Mr. Pan Guangdan. This manuscript also contains Pan Guangdan&#39;s comments. The second item is a six-volume history of Chinese immigration that I edited. The third thing is the books published by my students on the history of Chinese population and Chinese immigration. There are about six kinds of books. There are also many doctoral theses written by their students. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Our four generations have focused on the topic of Chinese immigration history, from unpublished university thesis manuscripts, to compiled six volumes, to so many papers, and we have truly passed it down. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Combined with your own experience and feelings, the development of historical geography and What is the connection between reform and opening up? &amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Ge Jianxiong:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;In general, historical geography used to be a very small subject. Later, thanks to Mr. Tan&#39;s &quot;Atlas of Chinese History&quot; and everyone&#39;s continuous efforts after the reform and opening up, the social visibility of the subject was improved. If he could not seek truth from facts when studying historical geography, Mr. Tan would be very painful. However, the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee restored the line of seeking truth from facts. On such a major issue as historical maps, Mr. Tan received support from the central government. Mr. Tan was very moved. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;After so many years of research, what is your understanding of historical geography? What deeper understanding has there been of the subject? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Ge Jianxiong:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;After entering this discipline, I feel that the development of the discipline is inseparable from the line of seeking truth from facts. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, Marx’s historical materialism fully affirms the role of material foundation in history, and historical geography studies the stage and material foundation of history. If Marxist materialism can be used as technical guidance, historical and geographical research can naturally serve reality. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some major issues can be explained from the perspective of historical geography, while exploring the positive and negative roles played by geographical conditions in the process of historical development. For example, Mr. Tan proposed in 1962 that the fundamental reason for the long-term steady flow of the Yellow River after the Eastern Han Dynasty was the change in land use patterns in the middle reaches, which greatly reduced soil erosion. The good degree of vegetation maintenance in the middle reaches of the Yellow River determines the severity of soil erosion. Therefore, farming or animal husbandry in the middle reaches directly affects the safety of the lower reaches of the Yellow River. He proposed that the middle reaches of the Yellow River cannot be all engaged in agriculture, and should be adapted to local conditions. Farming should be done if it is suitable for agriculture, pastoral should be used for grazing, and forest should be used for forestry. It needs to be comprehensively developed and fully utilized. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although this view has been criticized, its advanced accuracy has been fully proven after the reform and opening up. This is now the case in the middle reaches of the Yellow River, with some returning farmland to forests and some returning farmland to grassland. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;After becoming a doctoral supervisor in 1993, based on your past life experiences, you What are the differences in admissions? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Ge Jianxiong:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I am an eclectic person, and several students were recruited with the approval of the school. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Like my student Ma Menglong, he failed the doctoral entrance examination, but after talking with him, I found that he has great potential, has strong logical thinking, and is very good at using his brain. I encouraged him to go back and review before taking the exam. Later, I felt that it was not enough to let him review by himself, so I decided to recruit him specially. The school stipulates that academicians and tutors who have produced hundreds of outstanding doctoral theses across the country can be specially recruited. I took advantage of this right and came up with the questions myself.

I advised him not to worry, I believe you can follow me. Later, he slowly came to his senses, and his graduation thesis was of a very high standard, and even won the top 100 in the country. If I were not given autonomy, this kind of student would never be able to get in. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, Fudan has this tradition, which stipulates that academicians and doctoral supervisors who have produced top 100 papers have the right to recruit special talents. Then we should make full use of this right to discover special talents.

According to her description, there were five people in this &quot;travel group&quot;, including a couple and two men besides her. The group started traveling by car from Chengdu, and Daocheng Yading was the last stop. We originally agreed to drive back to Chengdu in the evening after climbing the mountain on the 27th. The woman involved said that when she came back at seven o&#39;clock that night, she found that the other four people had abandoned her and gone back first, and had stored her luggage in the hotel. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 29, events took a turn. Another woman who was traveling with her posted a clarification, pointing out several facts. First, the pick-up group had repeatedly emphasized to the woman in advance that they would meet at the foot of the mountain at 16:30 that day and then drive back to Chengdu, but the woman ultimately ignored this; second, everyone urged her many times to no avail and could not contact her. at 18:30, she finally gave up and left, but stored her luggage at the hotel and shared her experience on the return route; third, after the woman involved called the police, the police also confirmed that they were not responsible for the matter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Looking at the entire incident, it can be seen that the woman involved completely ignored the agreement between the &quot;travel partners&quot; and acted arbitrarily in the AA-style escort group, and always asked others to &quot;help her&quot; in the process. &quot;Leave her alone&quot;, claiming that it is not your prerogative. The most critical thing is that she failed to fulfill the punctual obligation of &quot;meeting at 16:30&quot; that the group had repeatedly confirmed, and she couldn&#39;t be contacted in the middle of the trip, so the other partners had no choice but to leave early. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To be fair, after all, travel groups are very different from travel agency group tours. It is completely possible to &quot;discuss everything&quot; on specific matters, as long as it wins the consent of the majority of people or does not hinder other members rights and interests. Taking this incident as an example, the woman involved could have disagreed with the meeting time in advance and tried to persuade others to postpone the meeting. Of course, the woman involved could also offer to give others a certain amount of financial compensation and wait until she came back before setting off; that was really not possible. , you can also declare to &quot;leave the group&quot; without interfering with each other, eliminating the need for subsequent disputes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, problems similar to &quot;tourists not arriving at the meeting point at the specified time&quot; will also occur in group tours of travel agencies, which has also caused many disputes. Whenever a similar situation occurs, there are always two directions. The first is that &quot;a group of people are waiting for one person&quot; but they dare not speak out and allow tourists who do not abide by the contract to damage the rights and interests of others; the second is that the travel agency &quot;does not tolerate him&quot; after seeking the consent of the tourists present and gathers them to leave first. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In March 2023, during a dispute over the &quot;One-day trip to Beijing Olympic Park&quot; involving a tour group from Tianjin, the tour guide asked to gather at 15:00, but tourist Song and four other people did not arrive until 15:30 because of their children. At the meeting point, the tour guide car has left at this time, and tourists have to return to Tianjin on their own. Song and others requested the travel agency to refund a total of 8,490 yuan including all travel expenses, liquidated damages, self-return expenses, and mental damages. After the trial, the court held that Song and others had breached the contract and the travel agency had no liability for compensation, and dismissed the plaintiff&#39;s lawsuit. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If travel agencies have obligations to abide by contracts and need to bear liability for breach of contract, then the same is true for tourists. Put it in the scenario of &quot;travel hook-ups&quot;, that is, every hook-up has an obligation to keep the contract, and they also need to bear the same liability for breach of contract. Of course, partners can also reach different proportions of rights and obligations distribution plans, and women can also receive some care, such as &quot;help her and let her&quot; in this incident, but this does not mean that the woman involved can Regardless of breach of contract, unless she really treats other partners as personal tour guides. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Details of this case show that the five-person group that set off this time did not reach any form of written contract, so there is no way to talk about their respective rights and obligations stipulated in black and white. The travel agreement between the group members was reached in the form of a verbal contract, and the only written form was nothing more than &quot;WeChat group chat records.&quot; After the woman in question withdrew from the group, the chat records became incomplete, which once affected the determination of facts and gave the woman in question room to gain a head start and &quot;preemptively draw pictures&quot; on social media. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, although &quot;travel partners&quot; are much more flexible than travel agency group tours, they still have to abide by the contract reached between each other so that the entire team can successfully complete the journey. &quot;Travel partner&quot; can be regarded as a tiny autonomous group. The success of the journey depends on the contractual spirit, organizational ability, communication and coordination ability of each team member. To put it bluntly, it is how to adjust the relationship between &quot;individual&quot; and &quot;team&quot; The relationship of rights and obligations between each other, so that each partner has &quot;equal rights and responsibilities&quot; in the itinerary, only in this way can the situation of everyone be improved. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Compared with the standard contracts and team formats of travel agencies and group tours, the travel format of &quot;travel partners&quot; is full of more flexibility and uncertainty, which also tests the comprehensive skills of team members. Qualities include but are not limited to physical fitness, interpersonal skills, self-rescue ability, adaptability, etc. This case also shows that in addition to safety issues, contract issues have arisen in the emerging business of travel hookups. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Freedom is not free, it also means responsibility. Even if it is a &quot;go as you please&quot; and &quot;flexible&quot; travel group, this kind of freedom does not mean that you can do whatever you want, and it cannot evolve into the behavior of letting others foot the bill at any time. Since the tour group has delegated the freedom of travel to each partner, it also requires each partner to fulfill their own responsibilities, abide by the contracts reached with other partners, and be responsible for their own choices at any time and bear the costs. , you can enjoy the joy of traveling with strangers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 05 Nov 2023 18:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[成都地铁被疑偷拍案开庭，涉事女子“差一个道歉”]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260000]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-05 17:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;He Jun described the incident on Weibo, with diagrams of each scene .

The person involved, He Jun (pseudonym), wrote in a long post on Weibo that he was secretly photographed on the subway by a small camera hidden in his shoes. He was then carried to the platform by a subway security guard and stood with one foot off his shoes and socks. span>;&lt;span>;The crowd&lt;/span>; watches. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;He Jun believes that this process is like a shadow in life. For this reason, he went through many twists and turns and brought the two women involved and the Chengdu Metro to the court, demanding a public apology and financial compensation. The incident occurred a week after a Sichuan University girl falsely accused migrant workers of secretly filming her, and thus attracted much attention. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Nearly half a year after the incident, on November 3, 2023, He Jun sued two women for a general personality rights dispute in the Chengdu Railway Transportation First Court. . The trial lasted for two and a half hours that day, and no verdict was announced in court. He Jun said on Weibo that when he recalled the entire process during the trial, he still felt very uncomfortable and had to constantly restrain his emotions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Liu Dan, He Jun’s attorney, mentioned, “Leave aside the issue of men and women, any person can defend themselves when their rights and interests are threatened. own rights.&quot; Liu Dan said that he understood the behavior of the woman involved in standing up bravely when she suspected that she was being secretly photographed; but with such rights, she should also bear corresponding obligations. After discovering that it was a misunderstanding, the woman involved&lt;span >;The child&lt;/span>; should apologize proactively. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/05/83324ca659.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;1080&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/05/83324ca659.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;257124&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;He Jun described the incident on Weibo, accompanied by diagrams of each scene. Internet screenshots&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Unacceptable apology&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;He Jun has told the story of the incident many times on different occasions. For the first time, He Jun wrote a long article on Weibo based on his own memories, and always kept this article at the top of Weibo. After the case entered the investigation and evidence collection stage, He Jun made additional corrections to some details based on the contents of surveillance videos and law enforcement recorders, and gradually updated them on Weibo. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On June 11, 2023, He &lt;span>;Jun&lt;/span>; took the subway home from Xipu, Chengdu. When he arrived at the South Railway Station, there was Two girls said they saw the green light flashing on his shoes and suspected that he was filming secretly. According to the video provided by passengers in the same carriage, two girls pointed at his shoes and said, &quot;It&#39;s shining, it&#39;s not reflecting light, it&#39;s shining.&quot; &quot;When we were filming, he put it on closed&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;After the train safety officer of the car arrived, He Jun took off his shoes in public according to the girl&#39;s request. After the train safety officer and the two girls checked, no camera was found. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;He Jun recalled to Southern Weekend reporters before the court session that during this process, everyone on the train suddenly focused their attention on him, and some people deliberately looked out. When he looked up, he saw someone was taking pictures with a mobile phone, which already made him feel uncomfortable. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Another place that made him feel uncomfortable was when he arrived at the station. The security officer and the station attendant arranged for him to stand against the wall and take off his right shoe. He Jun said that the environment he was in at that time was a public place connected to the platform. Passengers coming and going could see him taking off his right shoe and socks and standing next to the wall. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;I think this matter is not final. I was just a suspect at the time, so we should consider reducing some of the impact, such as taking me to a In a place with few people, maybe use something to block me, that’s what I thought.” He Jun believed that this was something Chengdu Metro did improperly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Liu Dan, He Jun&#39;s attorney, told Southern Weekend reporters that they added Chengdu Metro as a defendant precisely because Chengdu Metro had problems with expanding the damage. It is true that the subway security officer did not force He Jun to take off his shoes or search him, but after a preliminary check that he was not secretly photographed, he could consider finding an office where the two parties could sit down and negotiate and wait for the police to arrive. Liu Dan said that in the case, He Jun also took the initiative to call the police. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;After taking off He Jun&#39;s shoes for inspection, the police confirmed that there was no camera. The police also showed a restored video taken at the same location on the subway, and speculated that the advertising plates on both sides were reflected on the shiny surface of the shoes, reflecting green light. After mediation by the police, the two &lt;span>;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;girls&lt;/span>; apologized to He Jun. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;He Jun is not satisfied with this apology. He said that according to the video content of the law enforcement recorder reviewed afterwards, the older female student said &quot;I&#39;m sorry, handsome man&quot;, and the younger female student said immediately &quot;We I have wronged you.&quot; &quot;The entire sentence did not take more than two seconds,&quot; He Jun said. They were &lt;span>;wearing&lt;/span>; masks and could not hear clearly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In the long article recorded by He Jun afterwards, the police mediation was still continuing, and the girl &lt;span>;&lt;/span>; emphasized that she was speaking for the public. , to prevent other people&#39;s privacy from being infringed, and He Jun emphasized that the two &lt;span>;girls&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;girls&lt;/span>; had a &quot;meal-eating&quot; mentality to share their experiences with their friends. &lt;p>; &quot;After they apologized, I think they may have made up their minds (to defend their rights),&quot; He Jun said. The next day, he took the initiative to post the experience online with the subject &quot;I was falsely accused of being secretly filmed by wearing a shoe-covered camera on the Chengdu subway.&quot; &quot;, hoping to record the progress of his rights protection, and also hope to find &lt;span>;eyewitnesses&lt;/span>; in the same carriage through the Internet. The post quickly attracted attention. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;He Junfa&#39;s diagram on Weibo.

Internet screenshot&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Do not support using violence to fight violence&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;He Jun&#39;s rights protection process was not smooth. At first, He Jun could not find any evidence such as video of the scene to prove the place of occurrence, which made it impossible to file a case in court for investigation and evidence collection. After many twists and turns, a man in the same carriage provided a signed certificate stating that the incident had occurred on Chengdu Metro Line 1, and the case was officially filed on August 15. During subsequent evidence collection, Chengdu Metro informed the platform that the monitoring equipment was damaged and the video was missing. On September 27, after communicating with his lawyer, He Jun added Chengdu Metro as a defendant in the prosecution case. The main reason was that Chengdu Metro was suspected of breach of contract and infringement. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Although some netizens demanded &quot;severe punishment&quot;, He Jun has not disclosed the two &lt;span>;names&lt;/span online in the six months since he posted this experience >;&lt;span>;Girls&lt;/span>; appearance, name and other private information. He does not support the method of &quot;responding to violence with violence.&quot; &quot;I have never had such an idea, and I have been calling on the media and netizens not to (defame or bully the other party online).&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Ding Yaqing, a lawyer at Guangdong Zhiheng (Guangzhou) Law Firm, has represented cases involving sexual harassment liability disputes. She believes that the two women involved suspected that someone was filming secretly and found the subway security officer to intervene in the verification. There was no problem in itself. In some situations where sexual harassment is alleged, finding a third party to intervene can help resolve the dispute. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The key is that after the facts were clarified, this man spent time and energy to cooperate with the investigation and was scrutinized in public. &quot;He felt bad.&quot; Therefore, it is necessary and reasonable to demand an apology and explanation. &quot;The core problem for the girls in this case is that the process of &lt;span>; and &lt;/span>; apologizing was not explained in the end.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On the other hand, Ding Yaqing believes that Chengdu The train safety officers of the subway do not have the power to enforce the law, and their actions may not be appropriate in this regard. &quot;I noticed that the person involved said that the security officer carried him away,&quot; Ding Yaqing said. This &lt;span>;suggested&lt;/span>; whether the security officer exceeded his authority to conduct a search. She suggested that in places such as subways where sexual harassment accusations are prone to occur, staff should be trained, such as how to respond when such accusations occur, what are the staff&#39;s scope of authority, how to appease both parties, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;She believes that the response to sexual harassment accusations in public places can be compared to passengers encountering theft on the subway or bus - find a third party, The police, who have law enforcement powers, do not need to raise the issue of differences between men and women and gender antagonism. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Ding Yaqing analyzed that in general personality rights infringement cases, the responsibilities stipulated by law include stopping the infringement, eliminating the impact, making an apology, etc. He Jun&#39;s current demands One is to publicly apologize, but whether the scope of disclosure refers to the place where the incident occurred or on social media such as Weibo, and to whom it is disclosed depends on the court hearing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Liu Dan said that since the case is not open to trial, the form of a public apology cannot be disclosed. &quot;But it must be public, because the infringement is also public, and the apology It should also be made public.” After the court hearing that day, Liu Dan said in an interview that there was a fierce debate in the court and the other party also provided tenable arguments. He did not have high expectations for the verdict. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 05 Nov 2023 17:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[中央气象台发布寒潮、暴雪、大风、强对流四预警]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259998]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-05 16:00:51&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;At 06:00 on November 5, the Central Meteorological Observatory issued four major warnings: cold wave, blizzard, strong wind, and strong convection! &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;The Central Meteorological Observatory will continue to issue a cold wave blue warning at 06:00 on November 5:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Affected by strong cold air, it is expected that at 08:00 on November 5 As of 20:00 on the 7th, the temperature in the eastern part of northwest China and most parts of central and eastern China will drop by 6 to 10 degrees Celsius.

One day before the publication of &quot;Contemporary&quot;, he suddenly realized that when he and his companions were sent to a remote place, they were on the way to the west: and &quot;the west is the place where the sun sets, the place where snow accumulates, and the way to the west.&quot; It is a road with dusk clouds hanging low like a curtain, and people&#39;s hearts are always curled up in their chests.

It was so direct! &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;“There was a lot of scar literature in the 1980s that exposed the problems of the era. Most of them were complaints from victims. When writing about a character or event, there seemed to be hidden dissatisfaction and slightness. The protest carries a very subtle criticism, but it is not clear and does not describe specific political life, political tasks, or political beliefs. When writing about the so-called villain, do not go deep into his heart. It&#39;s just a symbol.&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Yin Shi pointed out that in &quot;Journey to the West&quot;, Qu Ming, who went to Yan&#39;an to study Lu Yi as a teenager and received a red education, was in the &quot;Cultural Revolution&quot; During this period, he became a speculator and the strategist behind Cheng Qiang, hoping for the success of another &quot;revolution&quot; and a new distribution of interests. This was the main reason why Ji Shuteng gradually got rid of Qu Ming&#39;s influence. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Zhou Tao also wrote about the inner thoughts of Cheng Qiang, a &quot;rebel&quot; from a peasant background, his judgment of the political trends at the top, and his heroic and loyal to his inner beliefs. Method of suicide. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Ji Shuteng didn’t like Cheng Qiang, but when Cheng Qiang became a prisoner, he was not happy at all. Cheng Qiang almost committed suicide by jumping off a cliff, which made him even more upset. He was shocked. &quot;He can&#39;t see others in trouble, just like he can&#39;t tolerate anyone being domineering... He loves freedom and advocates equality. Ji Shuteng also gradually sees another side of his nature. One person or some people bully or insult another person or some people, and This is not an ordinary thing, this is the kind of very horrific behavior; once this kind of thing begins, persecution, abuse, killing and destruction will follow.&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;span>; During their eight years in Kashgar, Qu Ming and Cheng Qiang shaped Ji Shuteng in his conduct as a person, and he was eventually surpassed by him. However, Ji Shuteng did not escape the more terrifying mental terror and spiritual torture. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Ji Shuteng was reported because he expressed his inner thoughts about his leader in a casual chat. Ji Shuteng started to write a review, and he immediately felt like a deflated rubber ball. He wrote in the examination that he must be &quot;reborn&quot; and so on, but he didn&#39;t want to actually shed his skin like a snake. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;blockquote>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;&quot;It doesn&#39;t hurt, it doesn&#39;t hurt at all, just feel free to peel it off, it&#39;ll be fine!&quot; ”&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(wife) Zhuang Yan took off a piece and put it aside for him to see.

He said, &quot;Don&#39;t throw it away. It&#39;s better to put it in the paper.&quot; It says inspection directly on it.

Yin Shi believes that despite flaws in writing techniques and character creation, &quot;Journey to the West&quot; has the value of a &quot;scientific investigation report on human nature&quot; by unabashedly revealing the inner thoughts and showing the ups and downs and thoughts of cadres&#39; children. &quot;For a quasi-second-generation official like Zhou Tao, spiritual autobiography and documentary value are the first step, and self-examination is a further requirement.&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http: //images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/05/7dc37dba640ff1da5d7f0082e3868018.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;564&quot; height=&quot;824&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm. com/cms/medias/image/23/11/05/7dc37dba640ff1da5d7f0082e3868018.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;257105&quot; data-mce-width=&quot;0&quot; data-mce-height=&quot;0&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p >;&lt;span>;If you combine &quot;Journey to the West&quot; with Zhou Tao&#39;s autobiographical oral record &quot;A Man and Xinjiang&quot; published a few years ago, you can better understand the extent of this &quot;self-exposure&quot;.

After the troubled times, God gave him the most suitable arrangement for him who was both civil and military. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The rest of his life seems to prove that he has been on a smooth road since then. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Zhou Tao who left Kashgar, like Ji Shuteng in &quot;Journey to the West&quot;, had no nostalgia for the yellow land where he had lived for a long time. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;&quot;Why are you so unsympathetic? The answer is: This is not my place in the first place.&quot; He believes that wherever a person grows up before the age of 18, that place will become His eternal home. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Before the age of 9, Zhou Tao lived in Beijing. Before receiving re-education in Yili and being transferred to Kashgar, he lived with his parents in Urumqi - clearly &quot;higher&quot; than southern Xinjiang in his eyes. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The sense of superiority is innate. The first is appearance. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;He has been born with white skin and big eyes since he was a child. Among the dolls with foreign children, he is also the most eye-catching one. The whole Zhou family has fair skin. He once asked his aunt, what is grandpa like? My aunt said, &quot;Your grandpa can&#39;t compare to any of you. He&#39;s so handsome.&quot; Zhou Tao felt that his family&#39;s bloodline should be mixed, because his hometown in Yushe, Shanxi, is a mixed race area, &quot;where the Xiongnu, Qiang, and Jiedi gather.&quot;&lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Xiao Qiao, a military writer who is nearly 10 years younger than him, said that Zhou Tao was born with a &quot;face and figure that make people doubt God&#39;s favoritism. Coupled with his humor, cunning, quick reactions and sharp words, This kind of person can easily make people jealous and at the same time create a desire for friendship.&quot; &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Beyond the skin, family background is the foundation. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Zhou Tao’s father, Zhou Wenjie, participated in the Shanxi Anti-Japanese Youth Death Team in his early years&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;（&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot; >;The non-party groups at that time were actually anti-Japanese groups led by the Communist Party. They later became regular troops&lt;/span>;)&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;, engaged in mass work, served as cultural teachers, and later became Chen Geng&#39;s subordinates. During the founding ceremony of the People&#39;s Republic of China, Zhou Wenjie, a battalion-level cadre, stood in the first row below the Tiananmen Gate. Later, he was admitted to the army as a diplomat and was assigned to the School of Foreign Languages. Before the &quot;Cultural Revolution&quot;, he was a cadre at the fourteenth level. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Zhou Tao’s primary school classmates include many children of senior cadres. A sense of superiority was invisibly injected into Zhou Tao&#39;s mind during his childhood. He remembered that when his younger brother was born, the hospital made egg fried rice for his mother at noon. She refused to eat it and gave it to 4-year-old Zhou Tao. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;At the age of 4, Zhou Tao was standing on a hillside in Haidian District, just in time for work in the morning. He felt like a general. &quot;Looking at the gray, blue and black crowds of people under my feet, I suddenly felt a sense of superiority in my heart.&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Zhou Tao will remember this idea throughout his life. Strange: &quot;How could such an idea come to mind at such a young age?&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;That idea was the bud from the foundation of his thoughts throughout his life. The buds grow and are associated with him throughout his life. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;His classmate Zhao Nan once saw a beggar on the street and said, what if we end up in this situation one day? Zhou Tao replied: &quot;Even if we are reduced to this point, others will look different when we stand.&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;&quot;Many revolutionary children have that sense of superiority. In fact, compared to this Judging from decades of history, it is very superficial. The concept of &#39;the world&#39; is also very decadent.&quot; Yin Shi said. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Zhou Tao was not aware of it. He wrote about the pride and stubbornness of Ji Shuteng&#39;s class in &quot;Journey to the West&quot;:&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;blockquote>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 凯体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>; There is a little guy who is only in the third grade of elementary school and can memorize the names, positions, and military ranks of dozens of marshals, ten generals, and more than sixty generals. The man was surprised and asked: &quot;Then what kind of general can you be when you grow up?&quot; The answer was: &quot;At least a general.&quot; When he grew up to sixteen or seventeen years old, he became more and more handsome, talented in sports and arts, just like the revolutionary career of his father&#39;s generation. There really is some kind of blood inheritance. But after entering society, most of them cannot adapt. ...As for the spiritual legacy of the Chinese revolution: the pursuit of social equality and the new culture of advocating altruism, they have completely disappeared. There is no doubt that Ji Shuteng himself is one of these people. He knows very well that he was &quot;fed by strictly selected food.&quot; He is also convinced: &quot;This is exactly how our generation is full of ambitions.&quot; Faith grows like a stone, water cannot be poured into it, needles cannot penetrate it, and it is difficult for anything else to penetrate into our minds.”&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;/blockquote>; &lt;p>; &lt;span>;Among such a group of stubborn leaders with high vision, Zhou Tao&#39;s unruly attitude is even more prominent. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;As evidenced by his father’s memories: “Tao loved horseback riding and bicycles when he was fourteen or fifteen years old. Once, he went to Nanshan with a party school cadre and rode a Kazakh horse alone. The horse galloped on the mountain road, and the witnesses were horrified. The leader yelled and cursed before stopping.&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;He has good physical fitness and once won the Xinjiang college men&#39;s table tennis singles championship. . But when I was in junior high school, I went to Beijing for a year of training, and I didn’t want to do it anymore. I deliberately trampled the ball and threw the racket on the wall. &quot;I felt particularly awkward after the head coach asked me to change the crossboard, because my personality is offensive rather than defensive. If I was asked to play defense, I wouldn&#39;t want to. If I didn&#39;t want to, I would destroy it and quit.&quot;&lt;/ span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Although he is unrestrained and youthful, he also has a way of assessing the situation that is different from his peers. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;At the age of fourteen or fifteen, he already understood that playing table tennis would not accomplish anything. It&#39;s not about physical condition or mind, it&#39;s about starting too late. &quot;If I were to be in Beijing, I would definitely join the national team. The conditions are sufficient.&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;There is another thing that he doesn&#39;t mind. Wu Guomei, a middle school Chinese teacher, gave Zhou Tao a score of 95 for his composition and gave him great encouragement. Other students regarded note-taking as a chore, but he was the only one who found joy in taking notes. &quot;Why did I win as soon as I wrote prose? Because I had written it a long time ago, and the ten notebooks are prose.&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Literature is talent, and it is also Zhou Tao&#39;s upward path. The clearest one. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/05/73a2271d659b7a2e6a6d7fc959a3ccde.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;869&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/05/73a2271d659b7a2e6a6d7fc959a3ccde.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;257103&quot; data-mce-width=&quot; 0&quot; data-mce-height=&quot;0&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span>;In 1965, Zhou Tao won the Xinjiang college student table tennis singles championship&lt; /span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4 data-css=&quot;box-sizing: border-box;color: inherit;margin: 0px;padding: 5px 15px 0px&quot;>;&lt;span data-css=&quot;box-sizing:border- box;color:inherit;font-size:18px;margin:0px;padding:0px&quot;>;&lt;strong>;An Inhuman Year&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;《Twenty &quot;Four Ploughshares&quot; was often requested by Zhou Tao to be placed at the top of his collection of essays, which shows that he attached great importance to this article. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;That came from the year he received re-education at Yili 9901 Farm. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;When we went there, everyone sat in a big sedan and sang along the way, such as &quot;Prairie Pastoral&quot; and &quot;Red Plum Blossoms on the Red Rocks&quot;.

&lt;/blockquote>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;荷尔蒙爆棚的年纪，陡然间从天上掉入泥坑。他开始琢磨出身与命运之间的关系。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;“人和人没有太大的差别，除非特别笨的人和特别聪明的人，大部分人都是一样的。人的差别都是社会造成的。我当时有一句话——如果平等，你们敢吗？如果在同一个起跑线上，我们怕谁？但那时你处处受压制，处处都碰壁，啥事也办不成。”&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;这种琢磨和玩味，从此伴随一生。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/05/a9168589bca8721555e60a9bdea74826.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;984&quot;

&lt;p>;&lt;span>;周涛一直慨叹，伊犁与喀什的10年，是自己人生最颓顿的岁月。近五十年后回首，他依然对父亲的“糊涂”报以嗤笑和不太理解。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;blockquote>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;1941、1942年的时候，父亲得了病，在驻军医院里成了日本人的俘虏。被吊起来拷打，他始终没有暴露他的军人身份。有一个汉奸先进来，他当时给汉奸写了一个条子，说你也是中国人，咱们都是中国人。我父亲的意思是让他帮忙。到了“文革”他被打成叛徒。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;我父亲属于小地主家庭的思维方式，还有点理想主义的东西，和现实距离太远，不太会接人待物，对啥人都热情，不适应中国文化。马文到我们家稍微一接触，她就说你爸的思维怎么像外国人？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;他是很厚道很正直的人，但他不是一个社会能力强的人。他这一辈子走下坡路，是坐滑梯的人。他不是不想跟，他太想跟了，但是他跟不上。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;/blockquote>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;1970年，已经开除党籍的周文杰被下放到昌吉吉木萨尔县国庆公社当农民，母亲也跟随父亲去了农村。两年后，老大周涛从伊犁农场再教育结束，确定分配到喀什以后，先带着妻子到吉木萨尔探家。他的散文名篇《吉木萨尔纪事》就是写的那次经历。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/05/d5fb99b945f2f7fbfac26d3fa269ca63.jpeg&quot;

data-mce-height=&quot;0&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;在村口，周涛抽根烟歇一会儿，打算过一会儿问问路。一个穿着黑棉袄的老汉拿着粪筐，老往他身边绕。周涛心想他看啥呢，还笑着。再仔细看看，这不是我爹吗？ &amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;blockquote>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;老爷子已经完全成农村老汉了，一个是穿着打扮农村化，一个是精神状态农村化，整个把他改造成农民了。我妈在门口站着等。她看着很可怜，头发花白，被风吹着。去的时候头发还没白，才五十多岁就已经老得很。他们觉得没有可能回来了，一辈子就成这样了。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;……&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;看着眼前的这个提筐子的人，我就想起少年时在机关院里与ー群顽童舞枪弄棍鏖战正酣时，突然出现在楼前怒喝我为“疯狗”的人；想起星期天逼我帮他冲洗全家无穷无尽的衣物，水寒刺骨，手冻通红，而他不把最后一点肥皂沫冲净决不善罢甘休；还想起那个原先穿军官制服尔后穿中山装干部服最后又穿上农民黑棉袄的人；而且想起曾经风采翩翩然后神态庄重终于苍老迷惘成现在这个样子的父亲。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;/blockquote>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;在散文里，他自责，自己总是由于父亲在现实中的失败而低估他，忽视了他作为一个人在本质上具有的优秀品质。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;吊诡的是，从说话的声音到走路的姿势，从身材和五官，到习性和灵魂，无论社会环境有利还是不利，他始终摆脱不了父亲注入自己体内的遗传基因。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;后来他领悟到：如果没有父亲这种结局的突兀出现，他很可能会沿着一个五陵公子的生活轨迹延续下去，直到有一天突然发现自己已经被社会的变迁远远甩在车厢后面。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;性情也就此有了收敛。 “他倒霉以后我就比较低调。心里有鬼，有软肋，老实多了，不敢再张扬了。”&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;在那个年代，文学是兴趣，也是为自己和家庭谋求出路的门径。婚姻，异曲同工。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;妻子马文的父亲当时是南疆军区政委、少将。在《一个人和新疆》里，周涛坦承，自己的婚姻是明显的机会主义行为，为此抛弃了那时的爱人，“终生内疚”。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;马文家本不同意接纳当时潦倒落魄的周涛，但马文一门心思和周涛好，跟父亲明确说，“如果你不让我跟他好也行，我听你的，但我一辈子不会结婚。”&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;结完婚不到十天，周涛便和马文一块去了伊犁农场。一回头，已是半个世纪。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/05/fcbe7b129290d54f13e3d7743edf0137.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;

&lt;p>;&lt;span>;坐在乌市部队小区敞亮的小院儿里，周涛对妻子的好如数家珍。 “她可能干了。家里里里外外都是她打理。你别看她眼睛不好，什么都明白。我这院儿里种的树，她全给我砍了，换了海棠、石榴、枣、杏、桃子、样样长得溜。”&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;周涛虽狂，却明白自己的短处。他外向张扬，但碰到突如其来的挫折，反而容易乱了方寸。妻子却不然，永远沉得住气。 “我会看自己，不大会看别人。马文善于识人，好人坏人，她看得很明白。办事能力在女人里面是出类拔萃的。”&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;马文对名利也看得开。周涛说自己退休进北京是够条件的，军队可以给他安排房子。 “马老太不去，她说她自己在新疆待着。她这个人有定力，不容易为虚荣左右。”&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;然而自传出版后，一位部队女作家按捺不住愤怒，撰文批评周涛放弃爱情，选择“最合适”&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;（&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;最安全、不惹麻烦&lt;/span>;）&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;的女性成为伴侣，用“中国男人传统的&#39;丑妻薄地热炕头&#39;”那一套来作说辞，最终对两位女性的总结以及功利性评判，又等于否定了自己的罪疚感。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;对此，周涛没有给予任何回应。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;“自传里的描述，你有给马文老师看吗？”我问他。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;“没。”周涛笑笑。笑容里既有“她就算看到，也顶多一笑置之”的了解，也有那么一丝丝的忌惮。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4 data-css=&quot;box-sizing: border-box;color: inherit;margin: 0px;padding: 5px 15px 0px&quot;>;&lt;span data-css=&quot;box-sizing:border-box;color:inherit;font-size:18px;margin:0px;padding:0px&quot;>;&lt;strong>;40岁之后，不再写诗&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;时运在上世纪70年代末降临在“怀才不遇”的周涛身上。依靠自己的文学才能和父亲的关系，他成功地调入乌鲁木齐的军区创作室，专心以文为生。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;1978年8月，作家曹禺和徐迟去新疆时，读到周涛的诗作《天山南北》之后，在座谈会上赞扬“有情有味，是真正的诗”。周涛被这大好消息弄得猝不及防，想起引发自己文学梦的昔日“神童作家”刘绍棠，“上高中老师在讲台上讲他的《大青骡子》，他&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;（刘绍棠）&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;和同学一起坐在课堂里听讲。那该是一种什么感觉！”自己而立之年碰上高人赏识，心中涌起欢喜。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;那之后的两三年成了周涛诗歌的爆发期。小乔记得，1981年的几乎每一两天，周涛就会有一首新诗的岩浆喷涌出地面。 “看看它们的日期，密集得如诗人每天出门时留下的足迹！”&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;周涛曾经和杨牧、章德益合计，打造“新边塞诗”，不是写征战，而是反映新疆地区的独特风貌。一时间，他们的名字接连占据了《诗刊》、《人民文学》、《上海文学》的版面，处在文学潮的风头浪尖。新疆文联主席刘肖无对此表示反对，理由是“边塞诗原来是征战西北的，现在新疆是祖国的一部分，你征战谁去？”&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;待朦胧诗起来以后，周涛曾给自己定向——“郭小川的声音、闻捷的色彩”，却发现这样的结合“不太好使”。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/05/0e32231c9649e4b49505957342ee2a0b.jpeg&quot;

data-mce-height=&quot;0&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span>;1984年，三位军队作家在昆明机场，准备乘直升机飞赴老山。从左往右依次为李斌奎、周涛、李彦清&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;1984年，他和另外两位作家一道受命去老山前线创作。一开始，他还拿上山的路险“添油加醋”说给没上山的作家听，吓唬人家；到后来，他亲眼目睹战士被越军地雷炸瞎了眼。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;习惯了，晚上战士们都睡得着。 “一个个钢盔在枕头边撂着，一个个面孔睡得像雕塑一样，一个个都是从死神手里逃出来的人。”&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;天天和战士们同吃同睡，混熟了，周涛从他们嘴里没听到任何豪言壮语。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;问打仗感觉咋样？战士说，“敌人炮弹覆盖的时候太可怕了，恨不得钻到地底下去，赶快爬不说，也顾不上姿势了。没法表述那个恐怖，那是人的意志绝对无法抗拒的，能躲过去就不错了。”周涛想象，我方的炮火覆盖对方的时候也是一样的。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;他写下了2000行的长诗《山岳山岳，丛林丛林》。诗里不光有战争的残酷，也有超越胜负与因果的书写角度：&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;blockquote>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;我的可怜而固执的邻居&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;我的性情忧郁爱闹纠纷的远亲呵&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;当我和你作战时&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;我的心其实是愤怒而又疼痛&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;几乎是一边在打一边在哭&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;我流着泪痛击着自己的另一部分&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;东方——是我们共同祖母的名字&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;却是活着的人们使之拥挤混乱&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;一切形式的死&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;目的都在于提醒和挖掘生的意义&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;死去的人已经不怕死了&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;活着的正怀着恐惧&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;——《山岳山岳，丛林丛林》&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;/blockquote>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;这首长诗只在两家不太著名的边疆刊物上发表过，单行本又因出版社方面拆版未能问世，没有进入更多读者的视野。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;“有点遗憾。被莫名其妙地忽略了。如果这首诗能在《人民文学》这样的刊物全文刊出，影响会很大的。”殷实等多位评论家和好友为周涛抱不平。作者自己倒是想开了，“写得太容易，很随便。只是在本子上开始写着玩，后来越写越长，一字没改，别人都不相信。”&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;周涛说过，他惟一的敌人就是自己。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;写诗写得兴高采烈，但他对自己的要求是：我的诗，达到全国&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;（顶尖）&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;水平，就不写了。果不其然，他40岁生日那天得了全国奖，他便觉得，自己的诗歌生涯也到了头。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;下一个要攻的山头？散文吧。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;周涛认为自己的贡献和独到在于“解放散文”：散文的写作“重要的不是化验和肢解，而是感受和拥抱”，他不喜欢“研究”，更愿意漫无边际地遐想、悠思、品味，所以他不在乎开头的突兀，不关心上下段的过渡和照应，而是以诗的逻辑、结构和笔法去写散文。他甚至口出狂言，“散文没有章法。我就是章法。”&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;于是在周涛的文字里，种种记忆、思想、情感和想象奔涌交汇，如越过堤岸的河水，在无际的草地上四处蔓延。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;他反感“游山玩水”的说法，认为那只是“把山和水当作精神意义上的妓女罢了”。在名作《巩乃斯的马》里，他把观赏马的气韵、筋骨当成艺术享受；在《猛禽》里，他聚焦一只与老狼搏斗、利爪分别深陷于老狼骨缝和树干最后被奔跑的狼撕裂的鹰；在《过河》里，惊叹年逾八旬的瘦弱的哈萨克族老太太竟制服了不肯过河的烈马……&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;无论是神山或者野马，或是人，在周涛激昂豪放的表达中，总会浮现出强烈的“夫子自况”色彩，自认强大并与强者引为同类的惺惺相惜。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/05/869c4630e5db9b2e0e06a7b6a78217b2.jpeg&quot;

data-mce-height=&quot;0&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;他的散文以篇幅长&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;（&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;好几篇都在两万字以上&lt;/span>;）&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;、强烈的表达和思辨冲动著称。周涛对此也曾有过冷静的认识：“思辨是散文里的一种成分，过分了，会伤害艺术，所以我特别看重贾平凹的散文，他恰恰不重思辨而撷取生活中暗含的底蕴，他更重对生活原始形态的直接感光。对他的认可，实际上表现我对自己某些缺陷的认可。”&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;虽然二十多年前已有上述认识，但自那之后，他急切言说思想的习惯，至今未改。 《西行记》里依然可见一斑。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;周涛的身上聚集着天之骄子的自得与时代笼罩在头上、害怕“丧失既得”的恐惧；他迷恋文学，以为它自由、公平，不像政治那样复杂。 20年前，以散文集首获鲁迅文学奖，他却没去领奖。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;原因？ “文学各种奖项和我心目中想象的距离太大。奖要公正，不能鱼目混珠，泥沙俱下，不能撒胡椒面，要奖给那些最值得奖励的人，不管那个人是谁，也许不是我。”&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;他说曾经的80年代，民族目标明确，人人充满希望，整个时代是《祝酒歌》所渲染的情绪。但90年代初，他无可避免地产生了虚无的情绪，游离于社会，不再那么直接。 《博尔塔拉冬天的惶惑》，便写于那样的状态之下——然而读懂的人，终是少数。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;&lt;span>;二十多年后完成的《西行记》里，周涛写到姬书藤等干部下乡，享受了叶尔羌河畔胡杨林下一顿烤鱼盛宴：“古老的麦盖提人变戏法似的，从河里捕捞出活蹦乱跳的大鱼！……托盘呈上，那种滋味，真是香透脑片骨！”&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;值得注意的绝不是美味，而在于美食供给者与享用者的姿态：&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;blockquote>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;检查团的领导们盘腿坐在胡杨林间的空地上，地上铺着华丽的和田地毯。村民捧着托盘，俯首躬身，膝语蛇行，如侍帝王。这些伟大的礼仪是谁教给他们的？这种令人噙泪的文明是什么时候养成的？姬书藤忽然心生愧疚，觉得自己配不上这样的盛宴和虔诚的礼节，对不起这些在篝火边跳刀郎舞、在果园里画农民画的沙漠人。我们为人家做了什么值得人家这样隆重接待？ ” &amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;——《西行记》&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;/blockquote>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;这让我想起周涛80年代创作的长篇散文《哈拉沙尔随笔》。在那篇文章里，他从同行人干裂的嘴唇，联想到多半个世纪以前，马仲英的回族兵和霍加·尼牙孜的维吾尔人血战，而今，往事遗迹却被干渴的北方之唇&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;（&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;无水的山沟&lt;/span>;）&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;吃光了。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;

&lt;/blockquote>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;他提出，“中华民族的历史不仅仅是汉族的历史，历代帝王、名臣、保国有功的武将中就不知有多少是少数民族。 ”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;这样的着墨和观点，在他几十年的丰盛书写里，并不多见。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;和他有忘年之交的殷实犀利地指出他的问题：“他对新疆这片土地，对维吾尔族等少数民族表达得仍然不够。周涛在这点上也表达了一个汉人的精明。他没有从语言、从经典、从世俗文化，方方面面——他没有深入新疆。 ”&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;在刚刚写就的《西行记》分析里，殷实直言：“如果他们每一个人&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;（主角）&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;的内在世界，也都可以像姬书藤一样展开，特别是，如果对那个维吾尔族人物司马义·艾合买提江的个人精神世界、文化性格乃至民族属性，有深入挖掘和呈示的话，那么这部作品中的众声喧哗，包括不同&#39;声音&#39;之间的对话，将会构成多么巨大的张力。 ”&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;为何无法展开？&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;“语言障碍是一，不敢再真实下去是二。只能到此为止。 ”周涛回答我。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;他表达过对张承志的钦佩，却也坦言后者在信仰上走向了极致。事实上，周涛在大学的专业正是维吾尔语，但不到半年，高等教育之路便被伊犁“再教育”拦腰截断。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;而他表达懊恼叹惜的角度是：“假如学完了四年维语，到南疆哪个公社当书记，再当县一级干部，对民族关系、人事各个方面了解多一些、再进入历史的研究和民族的考察，就可能组织长篇小说。但那半年我没有多大兴趣学维语，看不到这么远。 ”&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;他在心理上很靠近哈萨克这样的草原民族，自比为“一个习惯了毡房和羊肉、热爱着草原和纵马的半游牧者”。而对生长于斯的新疆，他自认此地为故土，却也始终是以中原文化的根脉来观察和体验。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;在文学评论者韦器闳看来，周涛极少描写市井生活，也不以表现百姓的喜怒哀乐和审美趣味为己任，而是极力张扬自己个人化的人生体验。于是他的写作也呈现出一种“贵族化”的倾向。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/05/97d629aae0ecf1617113532ed8d97452.jpeg&quot;

data-mce-height=&quot;0&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;回顾这大半生，周涛说自己介乎文武之间：生在军队里是武，这是打的底色；读书上学是文；当运动员从武；回来读书上学喜欢文学又从文：从文以后最终又跑到兵营里从文了。“可以说文不成武不就，也可以说文武两道都在滋养你，也都在制约你；制约也是滋养。 ”&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;到老，他在部队文职干部中算最高级别，享受军级待遇。反而是操持了一辈子的母亲，听到儿子涛说，“妈，我快当将军了”，回了一句，“你一天仗也没打过，当什么将军？ ”&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;“喀什的八年教会你什么呢？ ”我问他。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;他答：“不是你天生就怎么样，你那些个人的条件都必须在一个社会的大势之下才能得以施展和表现，否则一文不值。 ”&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;“你是宿命论者？ ”&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;他点头。“人各有命，运是社会给你的可能性。有胆无识是&#39;二杆子&#39;，有识无胆是书呆子。有胆识，还有运，才可能成大事。我和马文？不是运，是命。 ”&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;在全家被政治运动分崩离析的年代里，他发出诘问：“从一个个由家庭中诞生出来的自在的少年，到成为被社会和自身条件嵌入某一职业的成人，命运啊，你将怎么打发我们？是对我们格外垂青呢还是特别冷漠？对后一种可能，我们当时是不愿意设想也不可能接受的。 ”&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;时光过去了50年，谜底完全揭开了。让他无限惊奇的是，今天的谜底，当初已经不断向他显示。他始终相信，那时候，一切都已注定。&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;
