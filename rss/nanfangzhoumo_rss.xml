She usually has the habit of hoarding garbage. When she encounters cans, mineral water bottles, cartons Cardboard boxes, scrap wires, and even scraps from the village mosquito net factory were all picked up and taken home. She didn’t see much of them sold, so they were all piled up in the yard. My sister and I spend a long time cleaning up every time. Before long, she picks up so many things that they pile up like a mountain, and the small yard is like a garbage dump. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Not only that, my mother also has a lot of old things stored in her two rooms, including clothes, shoes and hats from many years ago, rusty iron pots, shovels, farm tools, and even old things that her father brought to her from Xinjiang when he was still alive. The cotton felts, blankets, and sheepskin jackets were in tatters and a mess. We have to clean her out, and mother protects her like a baby, for fear that we will throw her away as garbage when she is not paying attention. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In some villages and towns, old people with my mother’s habits are quite common. Some store less and put them in categories; some store more and put them in disorder; some garbage is mixed with daily necessities and they simply eat and sleep in the garbage pile. It is understood that this is mostly done by lonely elderly people. Very little of the garbage they pick up can be sold. Since they are unable to move it out, they have to coexist with the garbage over time. There are also elderly people who have children and also like to hoard rags. Their behavior and habits are often disgusted by their children, and they are even ridiculed as &quot;nostalgia mania&quot; and &quot;crazy&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Why do these elderly people like to hoard &quot;rags&quot;? Investigating the reasons, I found through investigation that they are nothing more than the following:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First, it is based on frugality and cannot bear to throw away old things. The elderly are used to living a hard life, and they can make do with the old things at home, and seldom buy new clothes or new supplies. Even if their children buy them, they are often not used to them. They still think the old ones are better and are reluctant to throw them away. Some old people do not want to sell the rags they pick up for money, but feel it would be a pity to throw them away. Old man Wang in his hometown village likes to collect old furniture discarded by young people. It is often seen that he uses a tricycle to transport it home. Someone asked him: &quot;You have saved so much, can you use it yourself?&quot; Old Man Wang said: &quot;They are all high-quality wood. Where can I find this before! I can dismantle it and it can be used.&quot;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;The second reason is based on nostalgia. There is warmth and emotion in the rags. Many elderly people are nostalgic for old things. Many of their clothing items have been with them for decades. Old things have memories, stories and feelings. In my family, my mother has a deep affection for the rags that have been piled up in two rooms, especially my father’s belongings. She left some of them when he was buried. Every time he wanted to dispose of them, my mother always said: “You throw them away as garbage.” &quot;Where can I miss your dad? I took out these things, rubbed them, and talked about them, as if talking to him...&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The third is based on loneliness, to relieve loneliness. This situation is more common among the elderly who like to hoard rags. According to my mother, Aunt Zhang&#39;s three children all work in developed areas and earn a lot of money. They send her money on time every month. It should be said that Aunt Zhang has no worries about food and clothing. But she got up early and stayed up late at night, rain or shine, picking up trash everywhere. Aunt Zhang explained the reason: &quot;My children all know how to be filial, and I don&#39;t lack anything. But they rarely come back throughout the year, and I feel empty. I don&#39;t pick up rags all for the sake of selling them, but I just have something to do and feel at ease.&quot; ”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The fourth is based on being noticed and longing for short-term happiness. When my friend was chatting with me, he mentioned that his relative, Grandma Li, who lives in the city, had a unique reason for picking up garbage. Her old courtyard is rarely visited by people, and only during holidays and New Years are the children and grandchildren reunited. The small courtyard is filled with laughter and joy. Those are the happiest and happiest days of the year for Granny Li. Later, Granny Li discovered that whenever the house was messy, her children would come to clean it, so she had an idea and deliberately picked up garbage and made the yard messy and dirty, so that the children would come back to clean it up, which made the house more popular and lively. , it’s lively. The two daughters-in-law couldn&#39;t stand her behavior and said that Granny Li was a little mentally disturbed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The elderly are keen to hoard rags and rags, which is not only unsightly and affects the sanitation of the family environment, but more importantly, the elderly have more or less problems with their mental health. As a child, you should not only clean up regularly, persuade and comfort them, and return them to a normal life track, but you should also look for the reasons at a deeper level. As the saying goes: To untie a bell, you must tie the bell. Children should not only pay attention to material support, but also pay attention to spiritual support. Just like the old song &quot;Go Home Often and See&quot; sings, &quot;Find some free time, find some time, take your children, and come home often; Bring a smile, bring blessings, accompany your loved ones, and go home often...&quot; Give the elderly more spiritual comfort and let them feel the deep family affection and the warmth of home. To a certain extent, this is richer than simply giving them Material support is more important! &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(The author is a staff member of the Standing Committee of the People&#39;s Congress of Tancheng County, Shandong Province)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;(The &quot;Hi, Southern Weekly&quot; column of Southern Weekend App is looking forward to your contributions .

He entered the industry late and had 50 jobs before becoming an actor. work. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of tvbs)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wu Kangren&#39;s voice came from the other end of the receiver. Like an old-fashioned man, he carefully confirmed the name of the newspaper and the reporter&#39;s name, and his tone sounded gentle and gentle. He is on vacation. When he is not working, he spends his time in the same way as ordinary people. He passes the time by watching anime such as &quot;Spells Come Back&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past few years, Wu Kangren may have been the actor with the broadest role map in the Chinese-language drama market. His images in movies and TV shows are so varied that it&#39;s jaw-dropping. In 2021, he dressed up in women&#39;s clothing, put on lipstick, and played the role of Mama Sang &quot;Baby&quot; in the highly acclaimed drama &quot;The Lights Are Coming&quot;. The character photo was published in Taiwanese newspapers, but no one reacted, &quot;It took two days to be discovered by others. Isn&#39;t this Wu Kangren!&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the 2022 drama &quot;Her and Her Her&quot;, he plays A pervert who is sexually harassed in the workplace has a female fan who is so angry that she wants to &quot;quit her fans&quot;. Wu Kangren is very calm about this. He told Southern Weekend reporters that he is not worried about the loss of fans of the drama and movies. &quot;The next role will be different.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These roles are a huge departure from the &quot;flower boy&quot; image he played early in his career. At the age of 27, he played Hana Takuya in the classic idol drama &quot;Next Stop, Happiness&quot; - affectionate, broken, and in line with all the settings of a tragic male lead. But in the following years, he continued to break away from that image full of romantic arcs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2019, on the 54th Taiwan Golden Bell Awards stage, Wu Kangren took the stage as the award guest. Everyone looked at the thin actor with sunken cheeks and a bald head with some suspicion. &quot;Isn&#39;t this a bald man?&quot; A barrage floated across the video. At that time, for the new drama, he lost weight to only 64 kilograms. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It has become routine for him to adjust his body shape, skin color and accent according to the requirements of the role. Someone made an Excel polyline table of Wu Kangren&#39;s weight data from &quot;Termites&quot; to &quot;Love&quot; and found that his weight suddenly went up and down, showing a steep W shape. A reporter from Southern Weekend asked him if he was not afraid of physical damage caused by drastic changes? He smiled and replied: &quot;I&#39;m still alive.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Fight&quot; is the key word that many people first think of when they mention Wu Kangren. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In September 2023, Wu Kangren changed his appearance again in the Taiwanese drama &quot;In This Lifetime&quot; broadcast exclusively on Station B. He put on a Hawaiian shirt, revealing his dark skin, and became the 41-year-old frustrated middle-aged Gao Jiayue. As the eldest son in his family, he has been drifting away for a long time, running a restaurant named &quot;One Million&quot; with a rating of only 2.8 in Xiaoliuqiu. After several years of bleak business, his girlfriend couldn&#39;t bear the island life and cheated on him and left. His career went bankrupt, his love failed, and he tried to hang himself in a restaurant, but the rope broke. Dive to the bottom of the sea, take off your oxygen equipment, and prepare to drown yourself. He suddenly remembered that the oxygen equipment might be eaten by sea turtles and was not environmentally friendly, so he had no choice but to surface and returned home dejectedly to meet his family and have a &quot;long farewell.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;My parents ran a breakfast shop in Taipei to support their three sons. The mother struggled to endure her father&#39;s mental infidelity and continued to live under the same roof with resentment. The second son is an adopted son. He lives a regular life as an office worker and takes the initiative to take over the responsibility of taking care of his parents. The younger son is older and unmarried, and helps in the breakfast shop. The whole family is stuck in the inertia of the old life and is stuck in moving forward. Everyone is in a &quot;stuck moment&quot; in life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wu Kangren said that he doesn’t have much in common with the character, but as a peer of Gao Jiayue, he has also experienced Kaka moments in real life. &quot;What&#39;s the hardest time for an actor? The role you want to take is taken away, or people don&#39;t like your good performance when it comes out.&quot; Wu Kangren told a reporter from Southern Weekend. His response was simple and clear: keep eating, sleeping, and trying. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2023 will be a harvest year for Wu Kangren. Two of his films, &quot;Fudu Youth&quot; and &quot;May You Live Forever&quot; were screened at the film festival. Both films focused on the bottom class. &quot;Fudu Youth&quot; was filmed in Malaysia, with Wu Kangren playing a deaf-mute illegal immigrant. After getting off the plane, he intuitively felt the gap between him and the character. At first glance, he was a &quot;white and clean civilized person&quot;, while the character he played lived in a dirty place all day long. He began to starve and continued to bask in the sun until his skin was tanned by ultraviolet rays and the locals in the market stopped looking at him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the 2023 First Youth Film Festival, he won the best actor for this role. The organizing committee commented on his performance: &quot;Faced with unconventional character settings, Wu Kangren used all available physical resources such as expressions, body parts, movements, and eyes to perform, interpreting the emotions and emotions of the film extremely vividly. Hearing thunder in silence reflects the actor&#39;s great empathy for the character&#39;s situation.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wu Kangren has a rare sense of relaxation. He has no agent or company and works for himself. Lasted nine years. There are no personal restrictions or team control. It&#39;s all up to you to decide what kind of scenes to take on, what roles to play, how much to talk to the media, and what the standards are. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He asked a Southern Weekend reporter which episode of &quot;In This Lifetime&quot; he had watched. After getting the answer, he conveyed his preferences as if he were a friend: &quot;Look further down, the back is really better. I really like it.&quot; I like it.&quot; Faced with the reporter&#39;s &quot;problematic&quot; question, he also bluntly said: &quot;This question is too broad.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From the outside world, the different types of roles over the years have brought Wu Kangren Emboldened. But he said that when he was young, his sense of self-identity was very low and he felt that he was just a &quot;nobody&quot;. He entered the industry late and had 50 jobs before the age of 20. He worked as a rough laborer on construction sites, ran a street stall, and also worked in cafes and bars. Now that I am in my forties this year, the feeling of insecurity has subsided, and new questions have arisen in my heart. He said that in recent years, he feels that his life as an actor will not be too long, so he cherishes it more and increases the frequency of taking roles. This year, he has at least seven film and television works released. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the end of the interview, he almost subconsciously revealed his expectations for his subsequent career. He said: &quot;I want to continue acting until I am old.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http: //images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/26/iNugJUjNXgJjxodcmTCYsmf9VQCWG6XI7zrO9Neb.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;519&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm. com/cms/medias/image/23/10/26/iNugJUjNXgJjxodcmTCYsmf9VQCWG6XI7zrO9Neb.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255555&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In &quot; In &quot;In This Lifetime&quot;, Wu Kangren plays Gao Jiayue, a frustrated middle-aged man. After his career went bankrupt and his love failed, he tried to commit suicide but failed and returned home in despair. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of tvbs)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In early October 2023, Wu Kangren accepted an exclusive interview with a reporter from Southern Weekend. The following is a self-narration compiled based on the interview content:&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;It would be good to grow this big in my lifetime&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;After receiving the invitation from &quot;In This Lifetime&quot; At that time, I had just finished filming the movie &quot;May You Live Longer&quot; in Hong Kong. When I finished filming, I only weighed 53 kilograms, which was too light. So before joining the set of &quot;In This Life Time&quot;, I ate as much as possible and weighed 66 kilograms when I returned. Last year I went to Malaysia and Hong Kong to shoot a movie respectively. I was made thin and dark. I came back to play the role of Gao Jiayue, a kid who came back from the island. In fact, he looked quite similar. In addition, director Xu Zhaoren is here, and I also like the script. I knew beforehand that Brother Xixiang (Xi Xiang, who plays the father) and Sister Guimei (Yang Guimei, who plays the mother) would take the role, so I also wanted to act together in it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The director took the sad story very lightly, and made the sad things somewhat funny, even humorous. Gao Jiayue is a person who really wants to die. But if you take what Gao Jiayue said to his nephew, &quot;I jumped into the sea, I wanted to die, but I saw turtles again, and I was afraid that the turtles would eat my equipment and it was not environmentally friendly.&quot; People say that he must think you are lying or joking. But when the audience actually saw the picture, all this became no longer such a joke: it was true, he wanted to die. I think this is where life is ridiculous. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;In My Lifetime&quot; is not about university knowledge. My own interpretation is, &quot;It would be good to grow this big in your lifetime.&quot; This sentence reflects a lot of feelings. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When things don’t go as planned, it’s always a “stuck moment.” In our lives, sometimes things go against our expectations, and sometimes hard work may not necessarily pay off. This is a very cruel thing. You can’t get what you want, and you can get what you don’t want. How you can stabilize your mood, continue to live, continue to love the people around you, or make the people you love live happily is all a matter of subject. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some people choose to escape, such as the parents in the play who have marital problems. Gao Jiayue came back to tell them not to continue evading. Some people tried to persuade them to make peace but not to leave. Gao Jiayue tried to persuade them to leave but not to make peace. Some people are always in his comfort zone, such as his two younger brothers, who complain about life but are unwilling to step out. How can a character like Gao Jiayue push them, but in such an annoying way? He has the courage to be hated. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Real-life family dramas are not as easy as genre dramas. It is very difficult to act in a very real-life way. We actors have been acting for so long and are very familiar with rhythm, technique, and movement. We are also very familiar with how to perform well on camera. But when we try too hard to show the good side, the sense of drama will be stronger and the audience can see it. Xu Zhaoren hopes to adapt it to life, so we revised the lines in the direction of life. Chatting with the director and imagining the characters every day before going on stage is actually very brain-burning and tiring. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The script of &quot;In This Lifetime&quot; is very well structured, and the relationship between everyone is clearly written. But we didn’t act according to the relationship between everyone in the script. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We feel that we have put a lot of effort into it. In fact, at that time, I was so thin that I deliberately imitated Brother Xixiang. Since I wanted to play his son, did I have any similarities with him? We looked at his posture and sometimes imitated him in jumping and sitting. At that time, I had a lot of discussions with the director. Since you want to play a son and a brother, do you have the same attitude towards each family member, or is it a little different? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, when you are getting along with your younger brother, you just love to bully him. How to bully him? The screenwriter will not teach you to hit them with your hands in the play. This kind of action must be designed by yourself. And it has to be connected to when you were a kid. The second brother in the play is not your biological brother. Your attitude towards your biological brother (reporter&#39;s note: third brother) may be different from that of the second brother. In fact, it is very subtle. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, the relationship with his father was not good in the script, but in fact when we acted it out, Brother Xixiang felt that he loved his eldest son the most because he was his first son. Child. It is a very straightforward way for parents to express their love for you verbally. Brother Xixiang’s method is the kind of love in which he scolds you the harshest and hits you the hardest. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The original way of quarreling with my father was to talk to each other, but now as the show continues, it has become that I can actually have a good chat with my father. You are a rebellious son, but you are always unwilling to take what adults say seriously, which means we are acting the other way around. So in the first episode at the beginning, the father guarded the drunk Gao Jiayue from getting up, saying that he was afraid that you would spit it out and choke to death. Therefore, the relationship between Gao Jiayue and his father was not a quarrel at the beginning, but a show of weakness, that is, I was homesick and came back to see it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the script, there is no drinking in the scene of returning home. We discussed with the director and couldn&#39;t imagine what kind of state Gao Jiayue was in before he dared to step into this home again. A failed person, a person who is unwilling to start over, a person who dares not face himself again, but is so arrogant and thinks that I will succeed when I go out to start a business, and then returns to this home penniless, at this time, what should I do? How to do it? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So what I thought of was, otherwise we would have a drink, and he would have to get himself drunk before he dared to return to this house shamelessly. In the end we decided to use this method. How on earth would he face the truth? You can only get yourself drunk. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In that scene, I really drank sorghum wine. I&#39;m not that good at drinking, but I drank in a situation that I could control. After filming, I fell asleep, and the actors called it a day, leaving me alone on set. When I woke up, the only thing left was the lighting crew taking out the lights. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/26/3ijT0Y9zockqo3BFBZxZtn4NO0EUMTVl8Cf8Zc2C.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;519&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/26/3ijT0Y9zockqo3BFBZxZtn4NO0EUMTVl8Cf8Zc2C.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255556&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In recent years, Wu Kangren&#39;s film and television image has been very varied, and he has played many impressive supporting roles. In 2023, he will have at least seven film and television works released. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of tvbs)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;At that time, I only wanted to take supporting roles&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4 >; &lt;p>;In recent years, Taiwanese dramas have become more varied in genre. Since they are so varied, of course actors have the opportunity to be varied. They just complement each other, from early idol dramas to later craftsman dramas, police and gangster movies, ghost movies, and now back to life. It&#39;s a big test for actors. You can&#39;t use your past skills to perform every play. When you encounter different plays, you have to make different adjustments. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I have no particular pursuit to play various types of characters, I just want to accumulate different acting experiences. It should be said that I think the life of an actor will not be too long. I dare not say that for everyone. I think it is a question mark in my mind how long an actor can act. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When I was in my early 30s, I began to realize this, which may have something to do with my upbringing. In the past, my self-identity was not so high. The so-called self-identity refers to self-confidence and even the value of existence. You may feel that you are just a nobody, a child who grew up on a construction site. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When I was young, I really felt that I could only work hard, otherwise what would I do? That’s why I got so many roles later. The reason I take on so many roles is not because I want to make a lot of money. In Taiwan, I can’t make much money from film remuneration. I hope that within a limited time, I can see my own possibilities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So after I turned 35, I started to play different roles quite quickly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;She and Her Her&quot;, &quot;The Lights Come on&quot; and &quot;Mom, stop making trouble!&quot; ” were probably all filmed at the same time, and during that time I only wanted to take on supporting roles. Because I think the burden of the protagonist is too heavy. The protagonist sometimes shoots for three or four months at a time. He is always immersed in a role or a long period of work. He is very tired and easily tired. I might as well play a supporting role. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since the epidemic was also going on at that time, I felt that filming supporting roles could be more fun and not be so stressful. You may say it&#39;s good to have more fun, but I have also reviewed it myself and found that those characters were really overplayed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Her and Her Her&quot; was a guest appearance to help, and I didn&#39;t think too much about it, because the role had to be played in a perverted way. I remember that the producer and director couldn&#39;t find anyone at that time, so they called me later. I had some friendship with the producer, so I went to help. I didn&#39;t want to attract everyone&#39;s attention, I just went to serve, serve. That role. I&#39;m not worried about losing the audience. The next role will be different. I&#39;ve never worried about it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;The First Light&quot; is another story. It was really because of good luck. I had a good role as the &quot;baby&quot; and he had a lot of space. He found me only after the filming started. I was free at that time and even Director Yi Qi asked you to act, and I said yes. I said you have to give me time to prepare, because I need to find a teacher to practice high heels and dance. In fact, we prepared everything in private, chatting with those drag queens, eating and drinking with them, and imitating their looks and voices. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So sometimes taking a role is not so calculated, sometimes it’s just a feeling, because the director is right, I go because the script is right, I go because there are certain actors, or I feel that If it helps this drama, I will do it. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;When you are not acting, you are just a nobody&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&quot;In This Lifetime&quot; has helped me a lot in my life. I&#39;m really lucky to be able to film &quot;In This Life Time&quot; at this age. Xu Zhaoren is a very good director, and it is very difficult to perform his scenes well. It was the third time I worked with him that this time I seriously felt that I might actually have done a good job. In the past, I didn&#39;t feel like I was able to add points to his dramas, but this drama did a little bit, and I felt like I was finally worthy of him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Actually, I take myself very seriously. Sometimes the success of a drama is the result of the team, sometimes it is the credit of the marketing, and sometimes it is the accumulation of credits between the characters. It is absolutely impossible to do it because of one person. Man, this drama is hit or miss. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I have always been confident in my life as an actor. The so-called confidence means that I am willing to do it, not that I am very good. This is a concept. In the past, it was a very simple and clear thing to work hard and be rewarded. This thing has a profound impact on me. If you work, work hard, and sweat for the construction site, you will get the salary you deserve. This is a must-have condition. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;And be responsible. You really have to do your job well, otherwise the boss will scold you, fire you, or ask you to pack up and leave. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Acting is the same for me. Sometimes why you are so fat and why you are so thin is because no one has done it, and no one knows what can be gained from it. I want to know what I can gain from the state of mind of being hungry or obese. I think this is irreplaceable and is self-cultivation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It’s hard for you to tell others that I was hungry for 4 months from May to August last year. From &quot;Fudu Youth&quot; to &quot;May I Live Longer&quot;, I lost 53 kilograms. I was so hungry. , how I lived. People just say, wow. But it’s not because my character has to be so thin that you can see how great I am, no. It’s about putting the characters there and seeing the finished product in the end. Even if the movie doesn&#39;t go well, people will think you&#39;re just thin, so what&#39;s the big deal? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Because you will really experience it after you do it. We are not like the protagonist of the anime. Why is he almost defeated in the end and still able to wake up? Because he thinks about his family and friends. Like Luffy in &quot;One Piece&quot; and Goku in &quot;Dragon Ball&quot;, he suddenly doesn&#39;t know where he came from. strength. We are human beings, and we still have our own limits. Limits can only be reached through self-examination again and again. If people don&#39;t make mistakes, they won&#39;t know that they will make mistakes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When I was acting, I often made mistakes, and I still make them now. It&#39;s just that sometimes someone will correct your mistakes, sometimes not, but I always hope to meet a director who can deny you. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The development of each actor is different. Some talented actors need to retain their energy. I consider myself to be mediocre and I need to accumulate that energy. The growth process of each actor cannot be compared. Since it cannot be compared, there is no repetition. The lack of repetition means that only I understand what I am going through, and you will not understand. Only after each finished product comes out will you see the difference. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When an actor is not acting, you are just a nobody. At most, you will be exposed to fashion or commercial performances, and you will see the glamorous star appearance. In fact, if you take away those appearances, who you really are is very vague. Celebrities have a popular persona, and that persona is the persona that the audience likes, because now everyone likes to see good things, kind people, and even people with high moral standards. The actor&#39;s appearance is very blurry, and there&#39;s nothing wrong with being blurry, it&#39;s just a different experience. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I have always felt that actors are people living in the past, and the works you see are all me from the past. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;Acting has never been free&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Actually, I have always felt that my work experience, having worked 50 jobs before I was 20, was not of much help to me. big. The accumulation of work experience is very life-like, but sometimes drama does not require you to perform life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, &quot;Copycat&quot;. It is a genre drama, and genre dramas are not life-like. If you want to stick to a life-like performance and conform to the rhythm of the camera and the director, when should you react? This is the pull between you and yourself. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Playing Guo Xiaoqi in &quot;Copycat&quot; was very difficult for me, very difficult, extremely difficult. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The skeleton of the genre drama is better written, but the portrayal of the characters may not be outstanding. Because it serves a crime and captures the real culprit, it takes the audience to see the reaction of each character. After watching it, the protagonist is actually empty. The so-called empty means that you can only accumulate some plots to serve the audience. How to put your own human flavor into it requires a lot of thinking. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, you want to play him very smart, but you don’t want to play him too handsome, a little quirky, but you don’t want to make him too mythical. If you just look at the ferocity of the supporting characters, the main character will easily disappear. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If &quot;Copycat&quot; is about using all the things accumulated in the past into one film, &quot;In This Lifetime&quot; is about forgetting all the things that I know. This is a transition between very skillful and unskillful. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Acting has never been free. How can acting be free? Acting is very scientific, including lenses, camera positions, performances, types, and even opponents. Acting is very unfree but very organic. Any situation may affect the whole body. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The so-called lack of freedom is that you cannot perform exactly the way you want, sometimes because of the orientation of the camera, sometimes because of the rhythm, sometimes because of the opponent actor, and sometimes because of what the character wants to present. situation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Why do you think you have to take on so many roles? Because I think acting is a very passive profession, I just hope to put some of my own initiative into acting work in a passive situation as much as possible. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The passivity of an actor is to be chosen. You will be there only after the script is written. If the script is not written, you will not exist. You may just act in another play. What space is there to be able to choose and take the initiative? That means to become thinner or fatter, to make the character more internal or more external, it doesn&#39;t matter. No matter what method you use, show your initiative. Those initiatives will affect the director&#39;s thoughts on the character, or the character can have a chemical reaction with other actors. This is the initiative that I think is valuable. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;That&#39;s what acting is, you bring out your own life experience. If you don&#39;t have this life experience, you need to rely on a lot of field research and investment. Except for a few who can&#39;t do it, others can rely on self-study and hard work to accumulate the short one or two seconds on the screen to deceive everyone and say that I look like me. But when you go deeper, whether the performance is good or bad depends on each actor&#39;s own interpretation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, I like many senior actors, such as Mr. Li Xuejian from Mainland China, who can act at that age, or Mr. Jin Shijie, etc. Actors who grew up in Hong Kong in the 1980s and 1990s, such as Tony Leung Ka Fai, Tony Leung Chiu Wai, Nick Cheung Ka Fai, and Andy Lau, each actor has accumulated hundreds of dramas, leaving his own place. But for me, that kind of accumulation is very difficult. If I follow the current pace of actors, I will never be able to achieve it. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Nine years without an agent&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;I have been without an agent for about nine years. In the early years, I was still looking for one, but because of one job after another Come, I will keep acting. If there is a job, I will take it, if I get it, I will act, and if I act, I will go on stage. If someone says hello, I will applaud. I will say thank you, and I will keep acting like this. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After four or five years, it seems that people (agents) no longer come to me. They seem to think that I can do this. But in fact, I am very busy and have many things to deal with, including contracts and work. Time, schedule. I haven&#39;t taken on so many commercial projects, and shooting commercials isn&#39;t too complicated. Relatively speaking, my acting life is pretty simple. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Looking back now, I feel that every decision I made before was good. I did not sign for a big company, but signed for a small company, and I will live a happier life. Later, he left the protection of his original agent, and finally became an agent by himself for no apparent reason. I also have to be an assistant and carry my own bag, which contains travel supplies and stomach medicine. Be your own driver and drive to the scene, finish work by yourself, and borrow clothes by yourself. There are things to do and things not to do. There are some jobs that you can choose, and there are some jobs where you don’t have to make this money. If you don’t make this money, you won’t have so many burdens and baggage. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I am an actor, and what we talk about is what actors do. In fact, I rarely talk about conditions, because if you talk about conditions, it will be complicated and waste a lot of thought. Being able to act well is the first condition. I&#39;m not a person who likes to compare. I don&#39;t compare myself to actors of the same age and tell them what they are like. If you don&#39;t think about it, nothing will happen. If you think about it, something will happen. You feel you are at a disadvantage because you have a value standard and judgment: my salary must be so high, or my conditions must be so high. If you don&#39;t have this value standard, there is no such thing as suffering a loss. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, last year&#39;s &quot;Fudu Youth&quot; and &quot;May You Live Forever&quot; were both very low-cost movies, so why were they filmed? Because I like the script of &quot;Fudu Youth&quot;, I want to try to go out and experience life. Different environments will have different sparks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I did go, it was very worthwhile, and I made a great movie. &quot;May I Live Longer&quot; is from Hong Kong, so it&#39;s the same. I just read the script and said I would go. I didn’t talk about where I would live, and I didn’t even talk about my salary. The producer was surprised and said, &quot;Don&#39;t you ask about the price?&quot; I said I don’t need to ask about the price, just call the contract. He called over the contract and it was this price. I laughed. I know they don&#39;t have money. If I think I can accept it, I will go, and I will be very happy in my heart, and you will be very relaxed, because you have nothing to ask for, so you will go, just asking for a good performance in the play. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From 2015 to now, I don’t want everyone to think that because my life has become easier, I am not willing to make progress. I also hope to accumulate something. At least the stuff coming out this year is above the level, and I don’t want to deal with the performance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It’s hard to say fate. It’s unlikely that you will have a breakthrough in every drama, really. This is a market. To survive in this market, we can only rely on each drama and how to play the role well after joining. In fact, there is not much that actors can do. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 26 Oct 2023 20:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[清远一所学校七百多名新生退学，官方回应]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259407]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-26 18:48:03&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;In response to Qingyuan Desheng Health Vocational and Technical School’s blind expansion of enrollment in the fall semester of 2023 without approval and replacement with online courses In the case of face-to-face teaching, the Qingyuan Municipal Education Bureau has set up a city and county joint working group to station in the school, ordering the school to actively respond to the concerns of students and parents, conscientiously rectify problems, effectively protect students&#39; legitimate rights and interests, and ensure normal education and teaching order. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Qingyuan Desheng Health Vocational and Technical School is a private secondary vocational school with 3,981 students currently enrolled (including: 1,215 in the 2021 grade, 837 in the 2022 grade, and 1,929 in the 2023 grade). After a preliminary investigation, it was found that the school expanded its enrollment without authorization, resulting in insufficient teaching staff and an inability to meet teaching needs, resulting in online classes replacing face-to-face classes.经工作组督促，该校秋季学期招聘的新教师陆续到位，基本满足教学需求，网课教学问题已整改，教育教学秩序正常。目前，该校已对退学的730名学生全额退费。清远市教育局指导该校依规办理2023级新生的学籍录入备案工作，督促学校加强师资培训和管理，确保教学质量。同时，为保障学生及时转校就读，清远市教育局提供市内有富余学位的中职（中技）学校信息供退学学生参考报读。 &lt;/p>;

&lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;美国在亚洲、中东的扩张&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;两次越战对美国的冲击，其实比朝鲜战争还要大。朝鲜战争中美国损失了约四五十万军人，这在美国历史上是空前的；而两次越战，美国都没有讨到好处——这两次越战延续，加在一起几乎有三十年之久，尤其是第二次美国从越南撤退，狼狈不堪。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;战争中不使用毒气，这是国际公约。二战期间，美国与德国之间、美国与日本之间，都遵守了这一原则。但是，日本人常常在中国战场使用毒气。美国在越战也使用了毒气，今天越南的幼儿之中，有畸形儿、难产儿；美国在越南森林之中散布的毒气，至今还弥漫于空气中，这都是造孽。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/F8msmxBku7WtZAiXfoW8laKteCWCkYzH6GhMGWV2.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;587&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/F8msmxBku7WtZAiXfoW8laKteCWCkYzH6GhMGWV2.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255338&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在苏联控制范围之内，东欧与北欧、南欧的一些国家，数次尝试脱离苏联阵营。每一次这种事情发生，CIA都深度介入，造成动乱。有的后果是国家改制、新的政权出现，但政权能够维持稳定的，只有匈牙利之春、波兰之春（1956年6月波兹南事件、10月匈牙利事件）。余外，中东的埃及、阿尔及利亚、利比亚等一串地中海岸回教国家的“颜色革命”，没一次不是破坏了原有的秩序；而那些国家原本已经开始的经济建设，几乎停步。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;从地缘政治而言，中东是必争之地，这片地区也是世界上最大的石油产区。美国用尽心力，从控制沙特阿拉伯开始加以掌控。沙特是英国当年从波斯帝国分离出来，独立的酋长国，后来变成酋长世袭的一个“阔财主”，却成为美国“心爱的宝宝”——为了他们的基地以及石油资源。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;1948年，犹太人回归故土，居然在耶路撒冷旁边切出一块土地，重建以色列——单单靠流亡的犹太人，能有这种力量吗？实际上是英国和美国在背后支持。英国在战后一蹶不振，以色列的主要支持者是美国。这个国家有它可佩之处，“无中生有”，很快就把国家建设得像模像样。希伯来大学的水平，不亚于中国的头等大学，不亚于美国的一流大学。台湾的军事研究院，常常请教以色列顾问帮助解决导弹问题，也请他们来帮助解决建立核电站的问题，这些人都是头等专家。我去过以色列好几次，人们纪律严明、生活简朴、奋发有为。但几十年来，以色列当年建公社的勇气、尝试与学习的心态都丧失了。可是，美国必须维护以色列。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;美国深入干预中东政治，发动了三次战争：海湾战争/科威特战争、伊拉克战争、阿富汗战争。然后紧接着，是伊朗战争。最近，美军才从阿富汗狼狈撤退。每次战争到最后，是颓垣残壁，当地被破坏得不成样子。美国三十多年的战争，将中东打得稀巴烂，地中海南岸、非洲北岸的国家，到今天元气还没有恢复。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这些都是“围堵政策”延伸出来的后果——美国扩张成瘾，每位总统任上都有一批将军希望扩张。与美国当权者有密切关系的黑水国际公司，专门做雇佣兵生意，杀人成千上万，一个个国家被毁坏，他们不用负责任。中东的阿联酋也是美国主导下的产物：将这一带几个小酋长联合在一起，建立“联合酋长国”——那里有全世界最奢侈的酒店，停靠着世界上最豪华的游轮。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;实际上，战后的日本，相当于美国的“殖民地”。在朝鲜战争中，日本为美国提供后勤补给、维修保障，也借机将二战时的老旧设备全盘更新。 1970年代，日本的工业辉煌一时，其生产率全世界最高。世界上日本商货遍地，丰田汽车、松下电器、西田百货，等等——日本商人所在之处，当地房价能翻两三倍。东亚一带的经济，也随着日本起来了，所谓“雁行理论”——中国大陆沿海地带，也在这一波经济荣景之中占了一角。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;如此情形，美国不能接受：“我将你扶植起来，现在你反而骑到我头上，将我的买卖都抢占了。”于是收紧银根、提高关税、专利索赔等手段齐施，三年之内将日本打到地下，到今天还没爬起来。所有著名的日本品牌，美国公司都占有股份。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;台湾比日本聪明，当年的建设不用美国的品牌，像台湾集成电路制造股份有限公司这种企业，都是自己申请专利权——台积电生产了全世界80%的芯片。当初设计台湾经济模式时，就考虑到日本的前车之鉴。台湾的长荣海运公司，是世界上最大的航运公司之一。希腊的大船队现在被美国“卡脖子”了，挪威的大船队美国卡不住。所以，这个“龙头”不讲江湖义气。中国江湖上的龙头老大，是老大吃亏、小弟兄占便宜。美国这个老大是：“你做了我的小弟兄，就得听我的，随我处置。”如此行径，怎不令人失望？最近美国在提高中国的关税，又以台湾问题要挟大陆。从东方到西方，美国的如此行为，使得其领导的国际圈内怨声载道。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;“美人迟暮”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;数十年来，我们也见过美国曾经的荣景，百年繁华。 1957年我到美国，正好在报纸上读到：一个非裔小学生要进入白人学校而被挡住了；国家动员了该州的自卫队，以政府的力量，将民众的反抗压下去。这种“黑白”之间的纠纷，至今没有停歇过。因为黑人群体仍旧陷落于社会底层，即使金（Martin Luther King, Jr）作了多大努力，也于事无补——种族纠纷问题，如今变成“种族惰性”，弱势种族不再争自己的权利，反而去争政府的失业津贴。从数字上看，美国缺工120万，失业人口只有25万，差不多100万人在领政府的失业津贴，不愿意出去工作。生之者寡，食之者众，经济就走下坡路了。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;美国科技迅速发展，今天的数字化、自动化、人工智能到此地步，厂房里面不见下层工人，只见工程师、检查员。 1970年，我从台湾到匹兹堡大学教书。当时一次大罢工，白宫震动，全国不知道怎么办。今天如果再有同样的事情发生，是否能同样撼动国家？一个国家假如有四分之一的人口，实质上是靠国家“社福基金”养活的，政府税收不够用时，只能靠印钞解决。支撑美金实质的力量，应当是国际贸易和国内的所得税——但实际上却是一团乱账。很多美国公司，收入在别处，富余的钱存在国际户头。如今美国的经济摇摇晃晃，所有货币发行限额等经济学上的定律，都不遵守。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;从1980到2008年，两次巨大经济危机，都是信用问题、贪污问题、虚假抵押等问题所致。原本，这都是资本主义制度不容许发生的问题，因为健康的资本主义市场经济，是靠信用承诺。两次经济危机几乎让美国经济崩溃。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/SnXMoQYx0RoIF2HMbbwDZ0Den6Mxw13zZapINkNc.jpg&quot;

&lt;p>;最近的美国经济，本该是大恐慌、大不景气的时候，居然出现物价回涨、股价回涨的情形——我们都看得出，其中有假。如此情形说明，美国这个国家在自我欺骗。但国内有如此多弱势群体在依靠国家的津贴生活，长此以往，怎么办？这些弱势群体，拥护不讲理的激烈右派，该怎么办？罗斯福当年倡导的“四大自由”很对，但现在“第五个自由”出现了：“别惹我”的自由。要不要工作、是否上学，等等，大家都认为是个人的事——如此“独立精神”，不是健康的独立精神。我希望中国的年轻人不要“躺平”——但是，世界的潮流似乎在这样发展，怎不令人担忧。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;十几年前，我写了一篇有关美国社会反思的文章，后来发展为一本书：《美国六十年沧桑：一个华人的见闻》。那时候，我批判美国将要面临的危机：政府官僚化、社会涣散、铺张浪费——尤其浪费在军事、国防上。然而，政府该做的事情却并没有尽到责任：全国的硬件设施，桥梁、机场、公路、水泵很多坏掉了，却没人管。当前美国社会，最重要的问题是国家精神涣散：政府天天在争吵的，是堕胎是否合法、变性人的权利，等等——不是说这些问题不重要，而是说这些话题占据了大家的注意力，沦为政客哗众取宠的项目，真正关乎国计民生的事情反而没人管。这个国家正在掏空自己的精神文化、经济实力，这个国家正在走向浪费、走向懒惰、走向消耗、走向空洞化。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“9·11”以后，美国以报复恐怖分子为口号，在中东介入无数纠纷。为了惩罚他们，美国在外战上消耗有多大？得到的丑恶名声有多少？国家多少的实力花在杀人上面？花在雇佣枪手上面？花在一架架无人机上面？ &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;历史上最骄奢的罗马帝国、最浪费的法王路易十四、最野蛮的俄国沙皇，他们的骄奢、浪费，都没有美国如此严重。假如美国经济这条大船沉没，像我们住在美国的人会跟着被淹死，全世界经济会随之没顶。如此危机，该如何挽回，这是令人彻夜难眠，也想不到出路的问题。但是美国如此败象，确实已经很难弥补。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;近年来，有很多批评美国资本主义的书，但对于这些批评声音，美国的政客不愿意听，或者来不及听——对于他们，最要紧的是如何抓到选票，入主白宫。当年我开始写《美国六十年沧桑：一个华人的见闻》时，至少有十二本书和大量批判美国的文章可用——今天我去查，这些自我批判的书没有了。可是，有识之士还是在批判，《纽约时报》《大西洋月刊》《星期六评论》，少数的几个记者和评论家，不断提醒：危机就要到了。 “火马上要烧起来了”，可没人注意。这件事令我不但感觉心酸，而且心伤。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我也劝告国内的“唯美派”，不要唯“美”是尚。 “美人迟暮”，会影响世界各处。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我曾看见美国人奋发努力的时候，看见美国民主运作是许多人努力的累积，看见美国对穷国、小国的援助，甚至于教会在各地对当地教众的支持和教育，都是令我钦佩的。而且，我曾经盼望美国的政治体制，有不断的进步和因时的修改。因此，今天看见美国社会的涣散、政治的庸俗，在国际关系上又如此地骄横而不知点检，大家可以想象，美国这个社会，从记忆中的美好形象，居然一变而为现实中破碎的残镜，我的心情不言而喻。 &lt;/p>;

Is &quot;taking a sip&quot; of bottled water, a common security inspection method, suspected of infringement? Recently, the Guangzhou Railway Transport Intermediate Court disclosed the trial details of a related case. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Passengers said they felt unwell after trying to drink their own water&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Taking Guangzhou Metro to court for compensation of 48,100 yuan&lt;/strong>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;On December 14, 2022, because Zhang entered the station with liquid, the security personnel asked Zhang to undergo a liquid test. Zhang drank the bottled water he brought, and then the security personnel released him into the subway. car. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Later, Zhang claimed that the bottled water he drank was self-bottled boiled water, and he himself suffered from gastrointestinal diseases, which caused him extreme discomfort after drinking water, and this incident also caused him severe mental illness. Because of the irritation and distress, the defendant filed a lawsuit with the court, claiming that the defendant Guangzhou Metro Company had infringed the law and requested compensation for medical expenses, lost work expenses, nutrition expenses, mental losses, etc., totaling 48,100 yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;[Judge’s statement]&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;There is no fault in the security personnel’s request for “drink tasting”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt; strong>;Passengers should cooperate and support subway security inspection&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Guangzhou Railway Transport Court held that this case is a dispute over the rights to life, health and body. In this case, Zhang claimed that the violation of his physical and mental health was caused by the security inspection behavior of the defendant Guangzhou Metro Company, and corresponding evidence should be provided to prove it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First of all, the Guangzhou Metro Company sets up security checks at the entrance and requires passengers to pass liquid detectors or &quot;take a sip&quot; if they carry liquids. This is because it is an urban rail transit operating unit. Therefore, the security personnel required Zhang to test the liquid he carried, and there was no fault. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Secondly, Zhang failed to provide evidence to support his claims of medical expenses, lost work pay, nutrition expenses, mental loss expenses, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The examination report form, outpatient medical records and other evidence provided by Zhang also show that he had been diagnosed with gastrointestinal diseases as early as the end of 2020 and the beginning of 2022 and had multiple examinations and medical visits. He was diagnosed with a sleep disorder due to insomnia symptoms. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Therefore, Zhang cannot prove that the subway security inspection’s request for him to “take a sip” of his own water has a causal relationship with the damage he claims. Zhang claims that Guangzhou Metro Company has infringed upon him and should be liable for compensation. Please, lack of factual and legal basis, the court will not support it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The presiding judge of the Guangzhou Railway Transport Court stated that security inspection is a necessary means for the subway company to fulfill its safety obligations, and passengers should support and cooperate as much as possible. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Civil Code clearly stipulates that operators and managers of subway stations, railway stations, airports and other places who fail to fulfill their safety obligations and cause damage to others shall bear tort liability. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Urban Rail Transit Operation Management Regulations&quot; promulgated by the Ministry of Transport also clearly stipulates that passengers are prohibited from carrying toxic, harmful, flammable, explosive, radioactive, corrosive and other hazards that may endanger personal and property safety. Items coming in and taking the bus. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When a vicious incident occurs on a means of transportation, the space is very limited and it is difficult to evacuate in time to reduce injuries. Therefore, security inspection, as the most effective preventive measure that public transportation managers can take, is reasonable and If necessary, passengers should understand and cooperate as much as possible. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To claim infringement, it is necessary to prove the existence of a causal relationship between the infringement behavior and the damage results. A general tort must include an infringing act, a damaging result, a causal relationship between the infringing act and the damaging result, and the perpetrator&#39;s subjective fault. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this case, Zhang claimed that the security check behavior caused physical discomfort and mental stimulation. However, the existing evidence can only prove that he had suffered from illness and insomnia before, but could not prove that he was physically injured after the security check behavior. Or the disease worsened, so Zhang’s claim for infringement and compensation from the subway company has no factual and legal basis. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 26 Oct 2023 17:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[“老实人”成了贬义词：语义嬗变背后是对消费和情绪的无度索求]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259338]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-26 17:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;It is generally believed that &quot;honest&quot; as an adjective has two levels of semantics in Chinese, one of which refers to morality. Honesty and reliability on one level, and secondly, law-abiding and orderly behavior on the other. Before the 1980s, &quot;honest&quot; was definitely a positive evaluation of a person. Whether in the workplace or in the marriage and mate selection market, the evaluation of &quot;honest people&quot; was similar to some kind of quality assurance and played an important role. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It can be said that honesty, reliability and law-abiding are out-and-out excellent qualities in any society with normal moral tendencies. However, starting in the 1990s, the semantics of &quot;honest person&quot; changed rapidly, and gradually became associated with negative connotations such as &quot;poor interpersonal skills&quot;, &quot;cowardly&quot;, &quot;stupid&quot; and &quot;low economic ability&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After entering the Internet age, &quot;honest people&quot; have been infinitely deconstructed, especially in the marriage and love market. &quot;Honest people&quot; are directly linked to &quot;low emotional intelligence&quot;, &quot;cannot provide emotional value&quot; and &quot;boring&quot;, and become With the out-and-out &quot;minus points&quot;, &quot;honest people&quot; are completely marginalized in the marriage and love market. A 2017 study showed that &quot;honesty&quot; surpassed &quot;poor economic conditions&quot; and &quot;no formal job&quot; to become the second largest reason why young people over 35 years old in a certain place become &quot;singles&quot; (the first reason is illness or physical disability) ). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In a live broadcast not long ago, an online anchor became furious because he was called an &quot;honest person&quot; by his fans. Perhaps he could not accurately grasp the changes in &quot;honest people&quot;. Complex semantics, but he instinctively felt insulted. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From the quality assurance of character to the infinitely deconstructed stigma in the Internet society, what have &quot;honest people&quot; experienced in the development and changes of modern society? &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;Honest people&quot; wandering in the midst of social changes&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In the early days of reform, the semantic change of &quot;honest people&quot; from praise to derogation is actually not difficult to understand. In the rapidly changing social environment at that time, the market economy and industrial civilization were rapidly changing all aspects of society. The life experiences that &quot;honest people&quot; who tend to follow the rules and practice in the traditional social life model are quickly overturned. And because they fail to make adaptive changes and responses to social changes in a timely manner, they will naturally be at a relatively disadvantaged level and position economically within a period of time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, drastic social changes have created considerable &quot;grey areas&quot; in the economic field. In such chaos and prosperity, &quot;the bold will die of hunger and the timid will starve to death&quot; once became a popular survival creed in society. There are indeed a group of people who have made their first pot of gold in these fields. The cautious and lawful side of &quot;honest people&quot; determines that they are destined not to be one of these trend-setters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Based on the above two points, the series of changes in the semantics of &quot;honest person&quot; at the end of the last century are actually a normal manifestation of the changes in individual value evaluation standards during social changes, and it is not difficult to understand. . After the social and economic order stabilized, the reputation and reputation of &quot;honest people&quot; took a positive turn. Especially during the period of rapid growth in the first decade of the 21st century, &quot;honest people&quot; were under construction and development. Showing a series of work characteristics gives honest people an aura of being &quot;down-to-earth, hard-working and willing to work&quot;, which improves the image of &quot;honest people&quot; to a considerable extent. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In contrast, the reasons for the infinite deconstruction and image decline of the meaning of &quot;honest person&quot; in the Internet society are much more complicated. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;Honest people&quot; who are excluded and marginalized by cultural capital&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;From the end of the last century to the beginning of this century, first television and then the Internet had a major impact on social values. With the popularization of television and the Internet, the cultural center effect of modern society has begun to become prominent. A cultural paradigm based on the cultural center&#39;s lifestyle and values ​​has been created and introduced to the public through countless movies, television, entertainment and variety shows. spread throughout society. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When countless young people living in the seventh and eighth tier cities, the urban-rural interface and the vast rural areas are immersed in the cultural products produced in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen, they are actually unknowingly Accept the life patterns and values ​​advocated by these cultural products. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In short, cultural capital uses a modern approach to reduce the vast majority of people to spectators, consciously or unconsciously watching a few people at the center interpret their lives. Most of the joys, sorrows, joys, sorrows and hatreds on the screen take place in the reinforced concrete forests of Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen. When &quot;small town youth&quot; and &quot;small town youth&quot; watch the screen as viewers, it means that they have subconsciously accepted the &quot;central paradigm culture&quot; expressed and conveyed by these cultural products. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This cultural paradigm based on the super city has quite distinctive characteristics - the social environment of a highly developed commodity economy, the values ​​of consumerism and hedonism, and the concept of love and mate selection of the urban middle class. Way. The cultural center effect is so strong that when some film and television works try to change the subject matter or scene, they often fall into embarrassing situations. In a certain film and television work, the protagonist from a poor background wears a down jacket from a North American brand worth more than 10,000 yuan, using seven The fact that the 8,000-yuan iPhone is considered a joke is obviously the result of the screenwriter being trapped in this cultural paradigm and unable to extricate himself. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the one hand, cultural capital spares no effort to promote the central lifestyle and values; on the other hand, it marginalizes and excludes other lifestyles and values. The core of this cultural paradigm promoted by cultural capital is actually the basic feature of postmodern society, that is, the desire for consumption and the emotional demand anytime and anywhere. The former is the most ideal state of material satisfaction that an individual can achieve in a highly developed commodity economy society, while the latter is the basic requirement to combat individual loneliness in a highly atomized society. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In short, under this cultural paradigm, a typical successful social individual either has endless money or the ability to please others anytime, anywhere, preferably both. Of. The problem with &quot;honest people&quot; is that they often have neither such economic standards nor such character conditions. Therefore, it is natural for them to become an excluded and marginalized group of people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In film and television works and entertainment and love variety shows, &quot;romantic, humorous, rich&quot; are the &quot;perfect characters&quot;, and the advantages of &quot;honest people&quot; are ignored or forgotten intentionally or unintentionally. On the contrary, &quot;honest people&quot; often become the ones who are ridiculed and ridiculed because they are &quot;dull&quot;, &quot;low in emotional intelligence&quot; and &quot;cannot provide emotional value&quot;. This stereotype created intentionally or unintentionally actually changes public perception in a subtle way. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As mentioned at the beginning of the article, honesty, reliability and law-abiding are out-and-out excellent qualities in any society with normal moral tendencies. A society that regards consumer desires and emotional demands as the highest values ​​must be a society where speculation is everywhere and scammers are rampant. After all, the places where the romantic, humorous and wealthy &quot;perfect individuals&quot; mentioned above are most common, except in Korean dramas, are The pig is being slaughtered. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 26 Oct 2023 17:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[湖北省原副省长曹广晶受贿、泄露内幕信息案一审开庭]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259393]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-26 17:05:33&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;On October 26, 2023, the Xuzhou Intermediate People’s Court of Jiangsu Province held a public hearing of the first instance against the Hubei Provincial People’s Government The case of former party member and deputy governor Cao Guangjing accepting bribes and leaking inside information. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/26/6ffc4b22d9f960091bb13be24853dc6b.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/26/6ffc4b22d9f960091bb13be24853dc6b.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;255666&quot; data-mce-width=&quot;720&quot; data- mce-height=&quot;479&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Xuzhou Municipal People&#39;s Procuratorate charged: From 2004 to 2022, the defendant Cao Guangjing used his position as deputy general manager of China Three Gorges Engineering Development Corporation and deputy general manager of China Three Gorges Corporation.

Following the elegant wishes of Teacher Zhang Yan, Hui Yu compiled and published it, writing a short essay and a brief explanation, for the benefit of others, and at the same time, it can be used to preserve the origins of a passage written by a senior scholar. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhang Zhongpu (1912-1987), courtesy name Zhanyun and nickname Oubo, was born in Yugan, Jiangxi. He studied engineering at an early age and studied at Jiangxi Polytechnic College, determined to save the country through science. He then changed his studies to law and graduated from the Law Department of Peking University in 1937 with a bachelor&#39;s degree in law. He then specialized in literature, loved classical literature and was good at writing poetry. Dedicated to education throughout his life, he served as a Chinese language teacher at Nanchang Normal University, Linchuan Simple Normal University, and Yuqian Yuting Middle School. In 1934, he taught at the former National Zhejiang University, Zhejiang Normal University, and Hangzhou University, mainly taking charge of modern Chinese literature courses. He is the author of &quot;Guo Moruo&#39;s Historical Drama &quot;Qu Yuan&quot;&quot; (Shanghai Literature and Art Publishing House, 1959), &quot;Analysis of &quot;The New Story&quot;&quot; (co-authored with Wang Rongchu, Zhejiang Literature and Art Publishing House, 1983), &quot;Yan Milou Poetry Manuscript&quot; ( Northern Literature and Art Publishing House, 2004), &quot;Notes on Xia Wanchun&#39;s &quot;Ode to the Great Sorrow&quot;&quot; (Threadbound Book Company, 2016), &quot;Modern Patriotic Poet Huang Zunxian&quot; (Tianhe Press, 2016), etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The sixth volume of &quot;The Complete Works of Zhan Antai&quot; contains nine letters from Zhan to Long Yusheng, Chen Zhongfan, Yang Shuda, Luo Xianglin and Liu Baiduan. &quot;The Complete Works of Wang Jisi&quot; contains nearly 50 letters by Wang. At the end of his letter to Zhang Hanqing in October 1987, he wrote: &quot;I used to occasionally write some prose, but lately I have been immersed in ancient books and have rarely experienced new life experiences, except for relatives and friends. Outside of letters and letters, they rarely write.&quot; It can be imagined that Mr. Zhan Antai and Wang Jisi still have a lot of letters and letters lying around, waiting to be compiled.

According to the &quot;Complete Diary of Xia Chengtao&quot;, Mr. Xia and Zhang Zhongpu went to Guangzhou to participate in a scientific research seminar at Sun Yat-sen University on January 5, 1957. On January 14, the two of them, accompanied by Zhan Antai and Wang Jinguang, visited Huanghuagang. The diary stated that they were &quot;majestic&quot; and &quot;taken a photo&quot;. This is the so-called &quot;Photography in Huanghuagang&quot; in the lost letter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Based on the previously published lost letters and the relevant contents of &quot;The Complete Diary of Xia Chengtao&quot;, it can be seen that after Zhang Zhongpu returned to Hangzhou from Guangzhou, he wrote to Zhan Antai and attached his own work. Check his &quot;Yan Mi Lou Poetry Manuscript&quot;, the sentence &quot;avoiding the soldiers and leaving the water in the Aotang, leaving the country is still the new willow shoots&quot; comes from Zhang&#39;s 1944 work &quot;The accumulated rain uses the Du Gongbu Hall to form a rhyme&quot;, the whole poem is: &quot;The accumulated rain and moss cover the grass, and the barbarian suburbs are temporarily stagnated by the smoke. The soldiers are left facing the water of the Aotang, and there are several new willow shoots in the country. The flying kites in the sky are startled by the meteorites, and the Peng in the clouds laughs at the nest. Zilan Ning It has the meaning of curing hunger, and the spirit of Yanjian Mountain is full of laughter.&quot; However, in the &quot;Poem Manuscript&quot; version, &quot;Yue Kun&quot; was changed to &quot;Ji Kun&quot;, which made the emotion even more intense. Zhan Antai said that &quot;it is pure and healthy, and it is extremely admirable for workmanship&quot; and &quot;it is still painful to recite it over and over again.&quot; Of course, he has the ancient etiquette of the older generation of scholars, but he also has a gaze like a torch, which illuminates the advantages of Zhang&#39;s poems. In his letters to Zhang Zhongpu in the 1960s, Miao Yue repeatedly said that &quot;great poems are fresh and elegant, and can integrate new ideas while maintaining the style and charm of old poems.&quot; , &quot;Great poetry can reflect reality, express new thoughts, and be admired after reading it.&quot; The two contrast each other, and the style and characteristics of Zhang&#39;s poetry can be seen better. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Yuan Ri Occasionally Small Ci&quot; written in the poem &quot;Begging for Correction on a Separate Paper&quot; also survives in Teacher Zhang Yan&#39;s home. &quot;Yuan Day&quot; is January 31, 1957, the first day of the first month of the Dingyou year of the lunar calendar. &quot;The Complete Diary of Xia Chengtao&quot; mistakenly refers to New Year&#39;s Day of the &quot;Renshen Year&quot; of Xia Zheng.

The poem mentioned in the self-note is &quot;I heard that Qu Chan (Cheng Tao) will have a poem to welcome Guangnan&quot;: &quot;Looking at the mountains, I can no longer be proud, and I love you so much that you live next to the raging waves.&quot; (Professor Qu Chan&#39;s River University, the door is opposite the Qiantang River.)

It lasted for more than three months. 120 teachers, cadres and a group of students were wrongly classified as rightists. Professor Ren Mingshan of the Chinese Department was even wrongly classified. For &quot;extreme right&quot; elements. After October, it entered the rectification movement, that is, the stage of rectification with the main forms of speaking out, speaking out, discussing, and big-character posters. Then, in line with the policy that &quot;education must serve proletarian politics and education must be integrated with productive labor,&quot; a large number of teachers and students went to work in the countryside. &quot;The Complete Diary of Xia Chengtao&quot; records that on December 20, 1957, the Chinese Department held a celebration meeting to celebrate the approval of Lu Moye, Gao Houzai, and Yu Shi to go to the countryside. It mentioned that the first batch of 56 people were approved to go to the countryside that day (&quot;Hangzhou University&quot; &quot;History 1897-1997&quot; stated that the first batch of decentralized faculty and staff was 144), and Mr. Xia also wrote a couplet to congratulate him: &quot;If you can go down, you can grow up, and when you go to the countryside, you can reach home.&quot; Wang Jisi said in his letter that &quot;Zhejiang Normal University saw off all his works&quot;. Zhang Zhongpu&#39;s &quot;Yimilou Poetry Manuscript&quot; contains a poem &quot;Sending Friends to the Rural Areas&quot;: &quot;Mountains are moved by nine ridges. It is common, but a fool of a thousand years will not expect anything extravagant. The truth is The barnyard grass is diligent in checking things, and the mulberry trees are planted by hand to make a home. The red rain in the sky turns over the spring waves, and the devotion to serve the country shines in the morning clouds. Why is it useful to ask Tao Ling to find the source? The east wind bursts with strange flowers.&quot; Mr. Xia&#39;s diary on December 12 also contains &quot;Part 2&quot; There are three poems in &quot;Hometown&quot;, with the preface: &quot;Rural work such as herding cattle, raising geese and ducks, harvesting rice and other tasks, I can still do it competently, so I wrote a poem for each to express my determination to go to the countryside.&quot; The poem goes: &lt;/p>; &lt;p >;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;The cow returns from its back and takes possession of the saddle, and the string singing urges people to eat more. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;The prosperity of the countryside depends on you, and you can see the black peonies of every family. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;It is not just to show talent, but to go to the countryside to promote prosperity. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;The bamboo whip in hand is like a military order, and a flock of geese and ducks will come. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Xincang Gao Yu Le Qiucheng, Nanmu Dongqian takes advantage of the moonlight. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;In those days of hard work, in the dragon battlefield, the vast expanse of green clouds listened to the sound of frogs. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On January 11, 1958, Mr. Xia submitted three pieces of &quot;Going to the Countryside&quot; to &quot;Wen Wei Po&quot;, which was published on the 17th.

There was an uproar, and the &quot;Roadside Club&quot; spread the news to see who would be the first to go to the battlefield; you can see that this young man had already prepared his bags, and even the old professor was not willing to give in. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;〔Liangzhou No. 7〕The whole country is united as never before, and we are happy that China&#39;s national destiny has been great, fifteen years Catching up with Britain is not a fantasy.

Moreover, the handwriting of this song is very different from that of the aforementioned letter, so it must have been written by two hands. Wang Jisi said in &quot;The Vicissitudes of Half a Study Room&quot; written in 1986: &quot;My former lover Xu Bixia was a wonderful partner in my life. In addition to doing housework, she also helped me receive guests and copy manuscripts.&quot; Just like Mr. Chen Yinke wrote a letter in his later years. The signatures were often ghostwritten by Mrs. Tang Yun, and Wang&#39;s piece may have been handwritten by Mrs. Xu. But in the same article, he wrote: &quot;The good times did not last long. After 1957, due to the well-known facts, I praised the &#39;joy of friends&#39; of the previous generations of poets in class and introduced the &#39;joy of the boudoir&#39; in their love works. &#39;, was criticized. Bixia died of illness soon, and the family lost its joy. Political avoidance caused the alienation of friends. This was another small change in half of the study.&quot; Mrs. Xu found out in early 1957 Suffering from a serious illness, he unfortunately died in September 1958. Therefore, there is still some doubt whether the copyist of this essay was Mrs. Xu or other family members or students. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;The draft of &quot;History of Literature&quot; has been put away since the second big announcement, and I don&#39;t know when it will be completed.&quot; Wang Jisi was involved in the matter several years ago, and Mr. Xia was slightly involved. According to the &quot;Complete Collection of Xia Chengtao&#39;s Diaries&quot; on September 8, 1953: &quot;I received a letter from Ji Si from Sun Yat-sen University, saying that he went to Beijing during the summer vacation and met He Qifang at the Qing family in Pujiang, Peking University. He said that the Institute of Liberal Arts of Peking University wanted to concentrate its efforts on compiling it within two or three years. The first draft of &quot;History of Chinese Literature&quot; was completed. Ji Si has been sent to work by CUHK for one year, and He Jun also wants to transfer me to participate in this work. Ji Si hopes that Yu can work for one or two years.&quot; September 30, 1955: &quot;Bu Kui Jiao came to the Song and Yuan parts of the literary history written by Ji Si. After reading and discussing the sections of Su, Mei, and European schools, there are many new ideas.&quot; December 24, 1957: &quot;Received from You Guoen, the editorial board member of the &quot;History of Chinese Literature&quot; of the Institute of Literature , He Qifang, and Yu Guanying wrote a chapter of &quot;The Rise of Ci&quot;, 8,000 words.&quot; May 25, 1958: &quot;Sent &quot;The Rise of Ci&quot; to Yu Guanying of Peking University in the afternoon. This comprehensive university textbook &quot;Literary History&quot; The first draft was supposed to be due in March, but it was two months overdue.&quot; This &quot;History of Chinese Literature&quot; was signed and edited by five people: You Guoen, Wang Qi (Wang Jisi&#39;s original name), Xiao Difei, Ji Zhenhuai, and Fei Zhengang. It was published in 1963.
