In addition, it also triggered the topic: In my country, the world&#39;s largest manufacturing country, the largest informatization country in globalization, and the world&#39;s largest online retail country, why does there still exist such a gap between producers and sellers? The &quot;cyber peddler&quot; class is both ancient and modern, and occupies a huge share and decisive influence in the market. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The explanation I put forward in the previous article is: just like the eloquent salesmen in the old society, in the process of walking around the streets, they can make potential customers buy or not. Feeling relaxed. In modern society, &quot;cyber salesmen&quot; like Li Jiaqi provide their fans with more than just eyebrow pencils, powders and lipsticks, but also emotional value, which is even more important than the actual goods. (Create a link: &quot;Before the &quot;best friends&quot; said bad things to each other: How can &quot;cyber peddlers&quot; like Li Jiaqi succeed against the trend?&quot;)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Therefore, after always using &quot;all girls&quot; as the opening of the live broadcast, use The &quot;bestie&quot; who held consumers in the palm of his hand and coaxed them into the clouds with his &quot;bestie voice&quot; suddenly broke out in his fatigue. When he began to &quot;struggle to educate&quot; consumers, he himself was &quot;cut off&quot; by the emotional value of the consumer. It is also an expected result that they are pushed into the whirlpool of public opinion. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It can be said that &quot;emotional value&quot; is not only the key element for Li Jiaqi from the clouds of the business empire to the center of the whirlpool of public opinion, but also the root of the survival of the &quot;cyber peddler&quot; profession in modern society. In fact, this concept has already surpassed the live broadcast e-commerce industry and has spread in all fields of this society. We should talk about &quot;emotional value&quot; in the workplace, &quot;emotional value&quot; in love, and even in family life. Let’s talk about “emotional value”. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So, what is this &quot;emotional value&quot; that everyone wants and is more important than the commodity itself in commodity trading activities? &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The spiritual pacifier of the adult world&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Contrary to the intuitive impression of most people, emotional value (Emotional Value), a term that looks very much like a psychological term, is actually a complete term. The marketing concept itself refers to the difference between emotional benefits and emotional costs in the marketing process. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To put it simply, in a shopping trip, regardless of whether the transaction is finally concluded, as long as the positive emotional experience provided by the seller to the consumer is greater than the negative experience, the consumer will obtain positive emotional value. This is a right Favorable results for the seller. On the contrary, if consumers gain negative emotional value, it will be an unfavorable result for the seller. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the sales industry, emotional value theory is often used to design and optimize sales processes, guide sales staff training, provide customers with a better consumption experience, and convert and fix potential customers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, as mentioned above, in today&#39;s society, both the concept of &quot;emotional value&quot; and the theory of emotional value itself have been greatly abused. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In almost all fields of social and interpersonal communication, people’s demand for “emotional value” is becoming more and more urgent and intense. On a popular social APP, you can see everywhere that the emotional value requested is not as good as expected. Various complaints are raised: the boss cannot provide emotional value, colleagues cannot provide emotional value, love/marriage partners cannot provide emotional value, parents cannot provide emotional value, and even strangers who occasionally meet cannot provide emotional value. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Here, &quot;emotional value&quot; has changed from a marketing concept to an ability, an ability to use language to make people feel &quot;comfortable&quot;. Regardless of whether this language is the result of rational thinking, or whether its rhetoric is consistent with objective facts, as long as it can make people feel &quot;comfortable&quot;, it has the ability to &quot;provide emotional value.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;People who are accustomed to asking for &quot;emotional value&quot; from others in life have a common characteristic, which is that regardless of whether they have this ability, they must require the other party to have this ability. While refusing to give in in public life, he complains that others cannot provide enough emotional value. This kind of mentality that is both strong and fragile, and wants to take but is unwilling to give, has formed one flammable and explosive tinderbox after another in social and public life, which can explode anytime and anywhere the moment they lose their pacifier. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Therefore, it is an obvious fact that in modern society, while information technology and communication technology connect individuals more and more closely, the continuous disintegration of communities also makes individuals become more and more independent. Alone, people end up becoming what Hannah Arendt called &quot;atomized individuals&quot; - they may be very closely packed but at the same time isolated from each other. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This kind of &quot;noisy loneliness&quot; makes atomized individuals usually place material enjoyment in a very high position in order to alleviate and comfort the spiritual loneliness. Correspondingly, this kind of individual is psychologically lonely. Vulnerability also drives them to endlessly ask for the so-called &quot;emotional value&quot; from the outside world. Therefore, the overwhelming emotional value in modern society has long since changed from a marketing concept to a spiritual pacifier in the adult world. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;A paradise of clever lies&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Just like in the business empire built by &quot;Cyber ​​Merchant&quot; with &quot;family members&quot; and &quot;queens&quot;, the emotional value is more important than the product itself. The &quot;emotional value&quot; that pervades other areas of society also exceeds reason, logic and objective facts themselves. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, in the discussion of public affairs, the rhetoric of &quot;putting aside the facts, isn&#39;t XXX wrong?&quot; that can be seen everywhere is an excellent example of this kind of mentality, completely regardless of objective facts. Regardless of whether there is a problem with your own thinking logic (or no logic at all), as long as the other party makes you feel subjectively uncomfortable, it means that you have not provided &quot;emotional value&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When an individual regards &quot;emotional value&quot; as the highest goal of social life, excessive and excessive emotional pursuit will inevitably consume and destroy their ability to think and express based on reason and logic. . The so-called &quot;thinking&quot; has become an animal conditioned reflex of &quot;if there is no pacifier, I will make a fuss&quot;. The so-called &quot;expressions&quot; are all the catharsis of accumulated emotions, and people cannot have any meaningful discussions, because all fact-based discussions will deviate from their original track and end in a hysterical mess. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A society full of such individuals must be a kindergarten composed of &quot;children aged 6 years and 256 months&quot; where &quot;everyone is fragile and needs to be coaxed&quot;, and it will naturally become a place where all kinds of clever words and tricks are Liars are at home in this paradise of lies. For some people, the sweet-talking online opposite sex in the &quot;Pig Killing Plate&quot; can obviously provide higher &quot;emotional value&quot; than the &quot;low emotional intelligence&quot; partner in reality. For the elderly, the health product sellers who hang around them every day and talk about &quot;Mom and Dad&quot; obviously provide more &quot;emotional value&quot; than their own children who come back once a month and become impatient with a few words. Ultimately, a society where &quot;there is always someone to trick you&quot; will inevitably become a society where &quot;there is always a liar that suits you&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The ability to regulate one&#39;s own emotions is the basic ability of adults living in modern society. It is normal for people&#39;s emotions to fluctuate under the influence of others, but if an adult&#39;s emotions are completely provided and controlled by others , then he can only be an adult in the physiological sense. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The process of social modernization is irreversible. Problems such as individual atomization, mental loneliness and vulnerability, and psychological immaturity that arise in the process of social modernization cannot be solved by reconstructing the pre-modern society where &quot;chickens and dogs hear each other&quot; solve. The ultimate solution to the problems caused by modernization is modernization itself. From the perspective of &quot;emotional value&quot;, we see a &quot;crisis of modernity&quot; that needs to be faced squarely and urgently resolved. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 03 Oct 2023 13:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[“陪拍”爆红，出租自己的工具人生意也火了]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257709]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-03 12:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 03 Oct 2023 12:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[专访谢飞：“如果内容都讲不清楚， 这个时代的电影就不会有光彩”丨影视大咖谈⑤]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257483]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-03 11:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/ 12/02/8mcJrhvBnwWykQYR6Cw86h5eBS1MXcd12I1qZ9R6.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;630&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/12/02/8mcJrhvBnwWykQYR6Cw86h5 eBS1MXcd12I1qZ9R6. jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;173882&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On February 22, 1993, &quot;The Fragrant Soul Girl&quot; directed by Xie Fei and Li &quot;The Wedding Banquet&quot; directed by An jointly won the Golden Bear Award at the 43rd Berlin International Film Festival. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xie Fei spends a lot of time in film festivals of all sizes every year. After the epidemic, he can only When participating in the film festival in China, he thought that the directors of his generation were nearly eighty years old and had not participated in social activities for many years. He asked the film festival: Can some old filmmakers be invited? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This group of &quot;senior moviegoers&quot; has become a unique sight at the 2021 First Youth Film Festival and Pingyao Film Festival. Xie Fei and his classmates were mostly film graduates in the 1960s and are representatives of China&#39;s fourth generation of directors. They call the beautiful years of making movies the &quot;Age of Innocence&quot;. Xie Fei explained, &quot;When we were filming the first and second movies, we were very young, even naive, but we had something sincere in it.&quot;&lt; /p>; &lt;p>;Today, most of their lives have nothing to do with movies. 79-year-old Xie Fei is busy sorting out his parents&#39; information during their lifetimes. A few years ago, he published family letters for his father and is now sorting out his diaries. His goal is to complete them all before the age of 85, otherwise &quot;if you are confused and unable to do it in the future, you will regret it.&quot; Others praised him for his good health and that he should continue to make movies, but he disagreed. In addition to movies, there are many important things in life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He publishes film reviews on Douban every now and then, and is known as &quot;the biggest film critic.&quot; His vision of watching movies is very broad, and he has to check out the latest movies, popular online dramas, and even popular animations. The Japanese science fiction anime &quot;Evangelion: The Movie: Finale&quot; has a Douban score of 9.2. Before watching this movie, Xie Fei deliberately made up for its more than 20 years of animation history, but he still felt &quot;confused. Can’t understand”. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In October 2021, the Pingyao Film Festival replayed his 2000 work &quot;Yixi Dolma&quot;. Xie Fei marked the film as &quot;seen&quot; on Douban. Netizens replied below: Have you not only seen it? &quot;Yeshe Dolma&quot; uses the life story of a Tibetan woman to reflect the changes in Tibet over half a century. Several Tibetan actors who were in their early twenties are now in their forties. Xie Fei invited them from Lhasa. They said that Lhasa is different now and more modern. Reviewing old works, Xie Fei was objective and confident: &quot;Although this movie has many shortcomings, it is not outdated.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xie Fei&#39;s film career began after the &quot;Cultural Revolution&quot;. He shot nine movies, &quot; &quot;Best Year&quot; and &quot;Scented Soul Girl&quot; won the Silver Bear Award and Golden Bear Award at the Berlin International Film Festival. It was the prime year for Chinese-language films to emerge in the international film industry. In 1993, the Golden Bear Award was unexpectedly awarded with a &quot;double yolk egg&quot;. Xie Fei&#39;s &quot;Scented Soul Girl&quot; and Ang Lee&#39;s &quot;The Wedding Banquet&quot; won at the same time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After &quot;Yixi Dolma&quot;, 58-year-old Xie Fei announced that he would no longer make movies. He filmed two TV series. Later, in 2003, he was infected with SARS and was classified as a seriously ill patient in the hospital. After recovering, Xie Fei stopped filming completely and devoted himself entirely to teaching at the Beijing Film Academy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xie Fei admires his 83-year-old old classmate Ding Yinnan the most. He is good at making biopics such as &quot;Sun Yat-sen&quot; and &quot;Zhou Enlai&quot;. In 2015, he co-directed his latest work with his son. &quot;He still has a lot of plans, so he won&#39;t stop. His physical condition is very good now. As long as his son is with him, he can take pictures until he is 90 years old.&quot; Xie Fei said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The representatives of American new Hollywood movies are about the same age as China’s fourth-generation directors. Martin Scorsese and Xie Fei are the same age, and they continue to create films at a rate of two to three years. Xie Fei wrote in a Douban film review, &quot;Envy, jealousy, but not hate. Everyone has his own destiny.&quot;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;On November 1, 2021, Xie Fei accepted an exclusive interview with a reporter from Southern Weekend in the office of Beijing Film Academy. &lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;“You are not a real director if you don’t make three movies in a row”&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: italics, italics _GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;What is the experience of veteran directors participating in the film festival this time? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xie Fei: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;We old comrades are very interested in watching the first and second movies made by these children in the digital age, including the later I have reviewed the award-winning films &quot;The Last Farewell&quot; and &quot;A Man&#39;s Funeral&quot; on Douban, and there are also some more traditional and solid films. And we found that such a folk film festival is doing very important work in supporting the growth of a new generation of young people. It was a very difficult process from graduating from undergraduate to graduate, shooting one or two short films, and then to making feature films. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past, we were all in the era of planned economy. The biggest difference between us, apart from the difference between film and digital, was that we were assigned to traditional national studios after graduation. There will definitely be tasks in it. We will act as assistant directors and scene recorders, and let you direct independently when you have certain abilities. And the country will require: This movie is for comedy and to make money; that movie is about kung fu, you have to do it even if you don’t like it; this movie is something you can explore freely and consciously on your own. So at that time, we had better conditions for growth than young directors today. After graduation, many of us would become independent after working as assistant directors for five or eight years. After independence, everyone made one movie a year and two movies a year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;In the studio at that time, if you had something you wanted to shoot What about movies? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xie Fei: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;First of all, you have to fight for the right to shoot. For example, like the now famous director Li Shaohong, she was assigned to Beijing Film Studio after graduation. I was Xie Tieli&#39;s assistant director and worked as many assistant directors. But her first film must be one that makes money. So she made her first movie called &quot;Silver Snake Murder&quot;, which was a thriller and did well at the box office. After that, the factory believed in her, because a girl had made a good film independently, and she made the second film she wanted to make, called &quot;Bloody Morning&quot;, which is based on the Latin American fantasy novel &quot;A Pre-publicized Story&quot;. Adapted from &quot;Homicide&quot;. She transplanted it to rural China, and the final shot was wonderful. In the planned economic system, you also have to look for your opportunities. For example, director Ning Ying came back from studying in Italy. She has her own school of thought. However, her first film at the Beijing Film Studio was a romantic comedy called &quot;Someone Prefers to Fall in Love with Me&quot;. Then she could make &quot;Have Fun&quot; - an art film that she really wanted to make and that had won many awards. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this era, we see that digital technology has lowered the threshold for photography. As long as you have the desire for expression and talent, you can sometimes shoot what you like, and it is very formal. Innovative films and we greatly appreciate their creativity. But after these people make this film, if there is no market in the future, no one will invest in them, and many people will not be able to take on the second film. And directing is a practical art, especially when you are around thirty years old. If you don&#39;t make three movies in a row, you are not a real director. You only have one movie, you haven’t had a creative team for several years, and you have less experience. I have met many directors at First. They made a beautiful movie and won various awards, but after three to five years, they never made another movie. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Are many young directors short-lived? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xie Fei: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;A lot. This is also (because) as freelancers now, in a commercial market-dominated situation, he must stubbornly only want to shoot his own things. He is not adapted to, does not know how to, and does not take the initiative to engage in entertainment and popular styles. Go and learn. Li Shaohong and Ning Ying, who I just talked about, have to force themselves to study well how to shoot entertainment films, comedies, and thrillers, and they will do well. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;In the current film ecosystem, what new directors face Are funding issues more difficult than they were then? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xie Fei: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;It was not very difficult at the time. &quot;Black Horse&quot; found many people in Hong Kong to contribute money, which was actually only more than one million yuan. Because the market is small, we don’t need to invest so much. We don’t have any special technology or equipment, and they are all quite cheap. The most expensive one was the filming of &quot;Yeshe Dolma&quot;. By 1999, the filming was completed for 4.5 million. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Now it depends on the director. If you want hundreds of millions or tens of millions, of course it will be difficult. The key is that the producer only dares to invest if he thinks he can make money back. How much is invested and how much is recovered is the job of the producer, not the director. The director&#39;s job is to be artistically complete. If the producer thinks that your story and actors can only make 30 million at the box office, then your investment cannot exceed 10 million. However, whether this estimate is correct or not is the producer&#39;s job. Now it is wrong to say that everything is the responsibility of the director all day long. Movies are a comprehensive art, and the director did not say that he would definitely earn 100 million. If you insist that you can earn 100 million, if you invest lavishly, if you dare to shoot with 100 million, then the protagonist will not give up until he earns several million. Some of them are very unprofitable. You should blame the producer, not the director. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When I was filming &quot;Yeshe Dolma&quot;, when I started looking for money, I also thought that maybe using a star would make this movie better. I approached Gong Li, and Gong Li&#39;s producer said after watching it one day, who should she play in this drama? At first when I was in my twenties, and later when I was in my seventies, I couldn&#39;t rely on anyone and felt like I couldn&#39;t act. Later I discovered that this was impossible. One was that the original taste of Tibet was lost. I saw another group of actors in Lhasa, including old actors in their seventies and actors in their twenties, and they were suitable. It’s effortless. You were originally a subject of art films and suddenly wanted to enter the commercial market. This was a miscalculation. Fortunately for me, I didn&#39;t. &lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;“Chinese films must be passed down from one generation to the next to have a bright future”&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: italic, italic _GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;What old movies did you screen at the film festival? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xie Fei: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Ding Yinnan’s &quot;Zhou Enlai&quot; was filmed in 1992, and it is now thirty years old. I very much hope that modern young audiences and The creators took a look at how our fourth generation represented the &quot;Cultural Revolution&quot; and a great man like Zhou Enlai in the early 1990s, and how we reproduced China&#39;s reality and history. All of us old people rewatched &quot;Zhou Enlai&quot; together with the young people. It was all shot in real locations, because at that time, Deng Yingchao said that he wanted to shoot in the Prime Minister&#39;s original house, as long as you think it&#39;s artistically acceptable. Therefore, even the clothes and shoes worn by Zhou Enlai and the handkerchief he put in his pocket every day are real. The ward of Hospital 305 where Zhou Enlai was seriously ill was also the same. The restoration of the external texture is very wonderful. So today&#39;s young people, how do you use your methods to truly express and record the real life in China? This is your responsibility. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Back then, it was a mission for these directors to make movies with the main theme ? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xie Fei: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;It’s not a task, it’s their request. No movie is made to commemorate any festival. Because the education they have received since childhood is the education of revolutionary history, they feel that these are important great men. I personally think that the main theme is also the same. The key is how you shoot it and whether you respect the audience. Many reviews of some movies today just count the stars, not the historical figures of that time at all. What is very important is that the most sensational TV series this year was &quot;The Age of Awakening&quot;. I was very excited to watch it. It was very good. It reaffirmed the achievements of Li Dazhao and Chen Duxiu, and it was also presented in a more artistic way. Further down, &quot;Mountains and Seas&quot;, a TV series about poverty alleviation, starts from the trail and writes about a village very vividly. I think if the main melody is made according to the rules of art, it may be done well and the audience will like it. The audience may also be disgusted by competing for stars and scenes. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;What do you think of screening and watching these old movies today? What is the meaning? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xie Fei: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>; Our generation is still alive now, so if you can speak, speak as soon as possible. Next year I think I will hire the fifth generation if it doesn’t work out. Except for Zhang Yimou and Chen Kaige, most of the fifth generation are no longer on the front line, and they haven’t filmed in a few years. Most of them are my students. Tian Zhuangzhuang is still filming. Recently, a film has not been cut out. Wu Ziniu has not filmed much anymore. In addition, Wang Jixing who filmed &quot;Jiao Yulu&quot; and Huang Jianxin have been doing it. Ye Daying filmed &quot;Jiao Yulu&quot; back then. &quot;Red Cherry&quot; was very sensational, and Mi Jiashan also filmed &quot;The Unruly Lord&quot;. If these films are taken out and watched today, young people will find them very vivid, and they never expected that they were so beautiful and had such pioneering consciousness and ideas. I personally feel that we need to understand the benefits of these works and the reasons of the times why they were produced. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Chinese films must be passed down from generation to generation in order to have a bright future. For example, people of our generation watched the third generation and the second generation. The earliest ones include &quot;Street Angel&quot;, &quot;Cross Street&quot; and &quot;A River of Spring Flows East&quot;. The best tradition in the early days of Chinese films is realism, and family ethics dramas are particularly good. . Family ethics are placed in the context of the great times. You think of &quot;A River of Spring Flows East&quot;, which expresses the great times through family ethics and has become a Chinese movie classic. In the third generation, &quot;Furong Town&quot; directed by Xie Jin is also about the moral and ethical changes of the family. Therefore, the type of family ethics is something that has been very successful in Chinese film realism. We must inherit it now. We cannot simply reject it and think that family ethics is tacky and the love between children is not grand. Another example is the second and third generation of Chinese films. They created kung fu films based on Chinese martial arts. From &quot;Burning the Red Lotus Temple&quot; to &quot;Shaolin Temple&quot; and &quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&quot; they have conquered the world. We young people can’t help but be interested, and we can’t understand that whether it’s an artistic film or a commercial film, it must be passed down. We don’t require everyone to cover everything, but we hope that there will be an inheritance as a whole. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What is the issue of inheritance? First of all, you need to watch movies that you have never seen and have forgotten. Your mind is filled with foreign things, especially some popular foreign movies. For example, in the Chinese theater industry, Western musicals have been praised over the years. I have seen it on Broadway several times. It is very popular, but it is very short and is far behind our operas. The opera actors have better kung fu than them. Much stronger. There are obviously such good operas in China, but they don&#39;t inherit or develop them. Instead, they just insist on reviving musicals in China. They have been doing it for 30 or 40 years. Do you think there is a mature one? Is there one that is loved by the wider music audience? Chinese film and television also have this problem. I watched Japan&#39;s &quot;Neon Evangelion&quot; the other day. I really didn&#39;t understand how great it was, including the recent &quot;Dune&quot;. This is the culture of foreigners, and they have had it for decades. If we Chinese are chasing these things to the death, you will never be able to make something that represents Chinese quality. When making movies in China, you have to learn things from the fourth generation, and even a lot of things from the third and second generations. You have only heard of &quot;Spring in a Small Town&quot;. You need to take a closer look at why &quot;Spring in a Small Town&quot; is rated so highly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;What traditions of the fourth generation do you think are still relevant to today’s young filmmakers? Lost it? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xie Fei: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I think what is very important is social thinking and cultural thinking. I think one of the biggest characteristics of the 1980s is that after &quot;Practice is the Only Criterion for Testing Truth&quot;, it caused the whole society to reflect on the &quot;Cultural Revolution&quot;. Scar literature and scar movies were produced on the basis of reflection, and later, root-seeking appeared. In literature, we have to look for the reason and our bad nature from two thousand years of feudal culture, so many movies are adapted from these novels. The greatest advantage of our time was that our thoughts and creations advanced side by side and encouraged each other. The stagnation of thought can easily lead to the author&#39;s self-restraint, and the author has no choice but to write some self-expression of small favors, small grudges, and small disputes. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/12/02/qEXM00Mnot1TgNA20aj93BJgsFbicHy87XI74aMt.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/12/02/qEXM00Mnot1TgNA20aj93BJgsFbicHy87XI74aMt.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;173877&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Xie Fei (left) and Jia Zhangke at the press conference of &quot;The Black Horse&quot; at the 3rd Pingyao International Film Festival on October 14, 2019. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（IC photo/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;“Many movies that are considered classics in China have not been seen by Westerners. to”&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Why the fourth generation of movies seems to have less impact on young people Is it as big as the fifth generation? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xie Fei: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I have a doctoral student who is a foreign girl. Her topic is the recommendation of Chinese films by the three major Western film festivals. In the Western world, film festivals have a strong value-added function. As long as this work is selected by a major film festival and enters the main competition, it will immediately rise to a level. If it wins the grand prize, many critics will want to see it, and in the end, it may become famous in historical circles. Consider it a classic. Before the &quot;Cultural Revolution&quot;, Chinese films were basically not produced in the West. &quot;Red Sorghum&quot; won the Golden Bear Award in Berlin in 1988. This was considered the first breakthrough. Zhang Yimou suddenly became famous all over the world, and then &quot;Qiu Ju&#39;s Lawsuit&quot; in 1992 &quot; and &quot;Farewell My Concubine&quot; in 1993. In the same year, all three major film festivals (awards) were won by Chinese films. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The reputation of the fourth generation of directors is not as good as them, because they have continuity. Zhang Yimou later had a series of films that won awards at three major film festivals, as did Chen Kaige before and after, and they appeared in the theoretical circles The title of &quot;fifth generation&quot; was adopted, and the previous generations were deduced. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As a student, I have read a lot of information about the three major film festivals. The third, fourth, and fifth generation films in the new era are all recognized by Westerners, but by some strange combination of circumstances, they all think they are fifth-generation films. generation. Xie Jin&#39;s &quot;Furong Town&quot; was wanted in Cannes after it was filmed in 1986. However, it was not given and was given to the Karlovy Vary Film Festival in the Czech Republic. If he had gone to Cannes at that time, he might have won the award in 1986, and the third generation would have become extremely popular. Without the award, the West didn&#39;t talk much about the overall review. In fact, in the later retrospectives, the West highly praised &quot;Stage Sisters&quot; directed by Xie Jin and thought it was a very good director. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is a textbook used by many universities in the United States called &quot;Understanding Movies&quot;. It was published in the early 1980s. Every time it is reprinted, new movies will be added. There are now fourteen editions. There is only one movie from China, &quot;Farewell My Concubine&quot;. Other Asian films, such as several films by Japan&#39;s Akira Kurosawa and even older films by Rai from India, were considered classics by Westerners, and their reputation soared. As for Chinese films, the three major film festivals have made Westerners aware of some Chinese films. The final conclusion of this study is that Western films have a one-sided understanding of Chinese films. Many films that are considered classics in China have not been seen by Westerners, do not know them, and have not been evaluated. We Chinese think it is good, but some of them do not recognize it due to political reasons. For example, they don&#39;t watch these main theme works directed by Ding Yinnan, but actually ask us to watch them. They are already very good, not much worse than their &quot;General Patton&quot;, but there are political barriers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is also a very clear example. The Sixth Generation was not screened in China at the beginning, but Jia Zhangke became famous all over the world. When he was probably less than fifty years old, he was awarded Lifetime Achievement Awards by several international film festivals. I heard at that time that &quot;Three Gorges&quot; is the Chinese film that has sold the largest number of films to all five continents and countries around the world, because from a humanistic perspective, Westerners think that the great migration of millions of people is a huge human social phenomenon, and this film is very Artistically expressing this change, they believe that Jia Zhangke&#39;s film is a thirty-year history of social changes in China&#39;s counties, and has very strong cognitive value. Then it was released (in China) and the box office was also very low. I remember that when &quot;The Good Man from Three Gorges&quot; was being performed, Zhang Yimou&#39;s &quot;A City of Gold&quot; was released. Jia Zhangke said sadly that no matter how good a good man is, he can&#39;t compare to gold. Jia Zhangke has organized various festivals and schools in China, and is also a deputy to the National People&#39;s Congress, so his status is quite high. But if you really ask the general audience, very few people have seen his movies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So in the fourth generation or even the third generation, many people have not had the opportunity to go out to some of our good works back then. Some, like mine, have gone out, but people have the impression that you are one of the fifth generation. So we often tell these doctoral students that in fact, from the 1980s to the early 1990s, the glory of Chinese films in the world was jointly created by three, four, and five generations. Another thing is to see that foreign opinions have their correctness and limitations. They are curious. For example, if you praise the correctness of the light, they will not be interested. But when they enter social reality and criticize reality, they are particularly interested. interest. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Did you care more about the recognition of foreign film festivals in the past than now? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xie Fei: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>; It has always been the case until today, but now I don’t take it so seriously. It seems that there was a news last year and this year that one of the three major festivals is a Chinese film None, unfortunately. After 2007 and 2008, Chinese films also entered the main competition, but they were very scattered. There are some that have won awards, such as &quot;Fireworks in the Day&quot; and &quot;Tuya&#39;s Marriage&quot;, but these films themselves are not particularly well received in China. Unlike at that time, &quot;Farewell My Concubine&quot; is still the most highly rated Chinese film on Douban now, so you can&#39;t say that the masses are influenced by foreign film festivals, and it itself is genuine. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/12/02/mFbNH1GMGKoFxmapTeecAQAZX2Q5CVZ0qbxQUp2E.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 960&quot; height=&quot;750&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/12/02/mFbNH1GMGKoFxmapTeecAQAZX2Q5CVZ0qbxQUp2E.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;173887&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Xie Fei and Jiang Wen on the set of &quot;Ben Ming Nian&quot;. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Information picture/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;&quot;The complexity of human nature is not captured in the photo.

In fact, I feel that the form is greater than the content, and I work hard on the form, but the content and even the basic plot narration are not up to standard. This is a bad thing, because content is the core. If the content is not explained clearly, the explanation will be even less weighty, and the movies of this era will not have brilliance. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 凯体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Many of your films are adapted from literary works , now many young directors like to write their own scripts, what do you think? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xie Fei: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;One is that many people do not read novels or read literature, and their literary foundation is poor. There are still some good works by writers who are still active in China. You have to be patient and read them. Every year, for example, the Mao Dun Literary Award awards countless novels. Not long ago, a TV series called &quot;Zhuangtai&quot; came out, which was very successful. This author also wrote a TV series called &quot;Zhuangtai&quot;. &quot;Protagonist&quot; is also very good, and it seems that it will be adapted into a film and television work. Regardless of whether it is a full-length novel or a medium-length novel, there is still an author who is writing things seriously. If we directors can pay attention and read more, we will find that there are many things that are more important than the stories we come up with and are worthy of your expression. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;还有一个就是自我得意，觉得自己能编剧，好的编剧写完了已经开始自导了，他觉得我干嘛要给别人做嫁衣呢？咱们对待导演吹捧过度。电视剧在全世界范围里，编剧是王，确实编剧起最大、根本的作用。像韩国就达到了对编剧很尊重，甚至三个导演轮着拍，哪集都不变样的，这个戏不会掉质量的。咱们这现在不是。很多人说，摄制组里除了几个高智商的主创以外全是民工，基层制作人员中专也没有、大专没有、蓝领学校也没有，他们的文化和技艺能力都得不到培养。一些影视教学，一天到晚说能不能培养出一个小燕子、培养出一个张艺谋来，好像这是学校的功劳，这是不对的。你应该是全面培养，因为影视制作、融媒体的视听制作，那是非常广大的天地，需要大量的技术人才和各种层次的人才。你要尊重他们，包括做服装的、设计发饰的、制作的，都需要技艺和文化。所以一个村的农民能包了中国电视的照明，这是在全世界没有的现象。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;你认为当下最好的电影会出现在哪里？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;谢飞：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;不知道，因为我看得很少。一个是我们自己要肯定，一个是国际上也能肯定。我反复讲一个观点，今天国外人看不懂的东西，未来两三代以后的中国年轻人也看不懂。你不要以为他是中国人就能看得懂，因为他离开了今天的社会，比如他们会想，为什么在农村不进城？有人说有户口、有粮票，他们就说，那是什么东西？现在的外国人看不懂，原因就是他不了解，你这个电影是就事论事，没有拍出人性的复杂，他就看不懂，未来的中国人也看不懂。你非要求他一定要懂中国的计划经济是怎么回事，他干嘛要弄懂？以前经常有人说，谢飞，你的电影光是外国人叫好，中国人不叫好，你不算成功。我说，你等着看，将来过上两三代以后，中国人还叫好我这个片，你叫好的片他就看不懂了。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 03 Oct 2023 11:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[仙雾缭绕梵净山丨指尖华夏⑤]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257587]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-03 10:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>; Fanjing Mountain in Tongren City, Guizhou Province is sometimes shrouded in clouds and mist, with cascading mountains and greenery, just like a fairyland on earth, attracting many tourists.

From 2011 to 2018, Wu Wei took advantage of various opportunities to go to Beijing to send cash to his daughter. Each time, he sent hundreds of thousands of yuan in cash. Wu Wei sent nearly 20 million yuan in cash to her again and again in the past eight years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some people wonder: The Civil Air Defense Office seems to have no sense of existence. How could the person in charge embezzle so much money? Let&#39;s put it this way, basically everything below the ground is under the control of the Civil Air Defense Office, so there is a lot of space for renting and rent-seeking. When developers build buildings and build underground garages, they stipulate how much area must be used for civil air defense projects. After completion, they must pass the completion acceptance of the civil air defense project construction project. In order to pass the inspection and acceptance, the equipment and materials used in the civil air defense basement often have to purchase designated products, and the so-called deposit or security deposit is actually the &quot;relocation construction fee of the civil air defense project.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Therefore, many people in charge of the Civil Air Defense Office have been dismissed. For example, in September 2023, Liang Fangsheng, director of the Fangchenggang City Civil Air Defense Office, was subject to review and investigation; in July, Xue Shibang, the former director of the Jiuquan City Civil Air Defense Office, was &quot;suspected of serious violations of disciplines and laws&quot; and was subject to review and investigation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Back to the Wu Wei case, this person put cash in his bag instead of transferring money, which shows that he has a strong awareness of money laundering and anti-money laundering. Transferring money will leave an indelible record. Cash is much more concealed; giving cash to your daughter shows that you love your daughter very much, that you are a &quot;daughter slave&quot;, and that you corrupt your family and your daughter. Taken together, it shows that he is a thoughtful person and a &quot;loving&quot; father. It’s just that the agency’s calculations were too smart. Once the incident happened, it was impossible for the investigators to ignore the whereabouts of the money. If my daughter suddenly had a large amount of cash in her hand, there had to be a reasonable source, right? There is no getting around the question of whether it is money earned legally by oneself. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Furthermore, everyone&#39;s discussion of this case naturally extended to the question of whether Wu Wei&#39;s daughter was guilty or not. Logically speaking, doesn&#39;t he have an idea of ​​how much legal income his father has? My father gave himself hundreds of thousands every time, only in cash and not in bank accounts. Ten thousand yuan in cash with a face value of one hundred yuan is 115 grams, and half a million yuan is more than ten kilograms. From Harbin to Beijing, it is more than a thousand kilometers. My father worked so hard, saying I didn’t know that the money given by my father was not legal, which seemed a little unreasonable. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Assuming that Wu Wei’s daughter is not guilty, there is still a problem of parents committing crimes and failing their children. Some netizens believe that at least the children of corrupt officials should be deprived of the right to take public exams. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For a long time, there has been a saying on the Internet that &quot;one person&#39;s crime affects his children&#39;s public examination.&quot; In fact, according to the express law, there is no provision that children whose parents commit crimes do not have the right to take public exams. Article 19 of the 2019 &quot;Civil Service Recruitment Regulations&quot; issued by the Organization Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China stipulates that individuals who have &quot;received criminal punishment for crimes&quot; are not allowed to apply for civil servants. There is no provision that children whose parents have committed crimes are not allowed to apply for or be hired as civil servants. There is an &quot;inspection&quot; after passing the public examination ( Also known as the &quot;political examination&quot;), there is no provision for children whose parents commit crimes to fail the examination. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, this is just a general situation. If you apply for secret-related positions or public security, judicial and judicial positions, there will be a substantial &quot;political review&quot; and it will be relatively strict. Take applying for a police job as an example. Article 9 of the 2020 &quot;Political Investigation Work Measures for the Recruitment of People&#39;s Police by Public Security Organs&quot; stipulates: If the family member of the inspection target has one of several circumstances, he or she shall not be determined as a candidate for recruitment, including intentional homicide, intentional injury causing serious injury, or Death, rape, robbery, drug trafficking, arson, explosion, release of dangerous substances and other serious crimes with a negative social impact, or corruption and bribery involving huge amounts and serious circumstances, subject to criminal punishment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In other words, if the parents have committed vicious crimes or been criminally punished for corruption, their children will not be able to pass the political review when applying for the police examination. Therefore, judging from the express provisions, the special conditions for the establishment of &quot;parents&#39; crimes affecting their children&#39;s public examinations&quot; are: it is limited to certain sensitive and key positions, and it does not mean that parents who commit any crime will be affected by their children; general public offices are not affected, and generally speaking, &quot;parents&quot; It is not true that crime affects children&#39;s public exams. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It can be seen that according to the current law, even if the children of corrupt officials who have been sentenced to actual imprisonment are unable to apply for certain positions or fail the political review, they can still apply for general public offices. But there is indeed a legal and ethical issue here. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Modern society is based on individuals enjoying their rights and taking their own responsibilities. In principle, children should not be implicated because of their parents&#39; crimes or any other faults. This is indeed good. However, the premise for this to be true is that the children do not enjoy the proceeds of their parents’ crimes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The situation is different if the child knows or constructively knows of the parent&#39;s criminal conduct and benefits from it. After telecom fraudsters defraud money, they will build a big house for their families and provide their children with the best education and living conditions. It can even be said that the original intention of some telecom fraudsters is to let their children and family live a good life. The children and family members also know that the money came from shady sources but still enjoy it without shame. What’s the problem if they are somehow implicated? On the one hand, a thief cannot just eat meat without being beaten, and on the other hand, it also serves as a deterrent to telecom fraudsters themselves, weakening their motives and incentives for committing fraud. Rather than sympathizing with the children of these implicated telecom fraudsters, everyone should sympathize more with Xu Yuyu. Xu Yuyu, a girl from a poor family, was defrauded of 9,900 yuan in tuition fees just after she was admitted to university, and she died in depression. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Similarly, if the children of convicted embezzlers know or are presumed to know that their parents’ money came from shady sources, and can accept it calmly and remain calm, even if they are not guilty, they cannot be called innocent, and they are restricted from taking public exams. What&#39;s the problem? Public offices are funded by taxpayers and should have higher moral requirements than ordinary people. Everyone should know that enjoying the proceeds of a family member&#39;s crime is at least immoral. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 03 Oct 2023 09:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[王者归来叶诗文：“我可能还会有下一个巅峰”]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258042]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-03 08:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/02/XEPQLTWFg1khdX7tCM5PueYqe9Sw7ngyMAmFisFg.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;624&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/02/XEPQLTWFg1khdX7tCM5PueYqe9Sw7ngyMAmFis Fg. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252945&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On July 31, 2012, in London, England, Chinese athlete Ye Shiwen competed in the women&#39;s 200m mixed Won the gold medal in the swimming final and set an Olympic record &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>; (Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The spotlight once again hit her, the former genius girl , stood on the podium again. On September 25, Ye Shiwen won the silver medal in the women&#39;s 200m medley at the Hangzhou Asian Games. On September 28, Ye Shiwen won the women&#39;s 200-meter breaststroke gold medal at the Hangzhou Asian Games. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The reporter asked her during the post-match interview, &quot;Do you think you are at the peak of your career now?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I used to think that 2012 was my peak, but now I think I will reach the next peak.&quot; Ye Shiwen replied. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2012, 16-year-old Ye Shiwen won the women&#39;s 200m and 400m individual medley double championships at the London Olympics, which became the pinnacle of her career. Just two years ago at the 2010 Guangzhou Asian Games, Ye Shiwen had already won the gold medals in these two categories. Most of the news headlines at the time called it &quot;the birth of a genius girl.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After winning, the next lesson that cannot be escaped is &quot;how to face losing&quot;. This is the sweet cruelty of becoming a champion. In the summer when she was 25 years old, Ye Shiwen stayed in Hangzhou, the venue for the Asian Games today. At that time, Tokyo, which was 2,000 kilometers away in a straight line, was the venue that she failed to reach. She missed out on the Tokyo Olympics by a hair&#39;s breadth in the trials. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It was a long &quot;losing&quot; and a battle with oneself. When being interviewed when preparing for the Asian Games in 2022, Ye Shiwen&#39;s feelings contained some feelings of &quot;ending a full stop&quot;: She is from If you start learning swimming in Hangzhou, you should end it here, like some kind of fate. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Until he won another championship in the Hangzhou Asian Games, Ye Shiwen gave his answer with &quot;There will be a next peak.&quot; This is a continuation, not an end. Time has helped this professional athlete establish a more comprehensive answer. Swimming is no longer the only thing she loves, but swimming is still her favorite thing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/02/AuiWoJleFDyfrUU3AztmsSb69bwYaX35tjsvnFwN.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;646&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/02/AuiWoJleFDyfrUU3AztmsSb69bwYaX35tjsvnFwN.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252946&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On September 28, 2023, in the women&#39;s 200-meter breaststroke final of the Hangzhou Asian Games swimming event, Chinese player Ye Shiwen won the championship with a time of 2 minutes, 23.84 seconds&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Xinhua News Agency/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/02/8cCb2a70EVVyXymEwS8EToBJ2jnXps4tm7rrrcpV .jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;681&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/02/8cCb2a70EVVyXymEwS8EToBJ2jnXps4tm7rrrcpV.jpg&quot; data-key =&quot;252947&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;September 25, 2023, Chinese players Yu Yiting (right) and Ye Shiwen (left) After the women&#39;s 200m individual medley final.

This was the first time in nine years since she won three gold medals at the Incheon Asian Games in 2014 that she reached the top of the Asian Games again. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The women&#39;s 200-meter breaststroke is Ye Shiwen&#39;s key preparation event for the Hangzhou Asian Games. After lagging behind in the first 50 meters, she continued to accelerate and surpass her opponent. Later, she gradually expanded her lead to one position and won the championship with a clear advantage of 2.47 seconds ahead of the second place. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I have always wanted to stand on the top podium again. This time I did it at home. I am very excited.&quot; Ye Shiwen said in an interview after the game that this was his first time When we got to the edge, we took a splash of water to celebrate. This excitement comes not only from breaking external records, but also from the joy of defeating oneself. Ye Shiwen said that there is still some gap between the results and expectations, and the next step is to lay a solid foundation in winter training. &quot;I hope I can be selected (to participate in the Paris Olympics).&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Looking at this professional athlete&#39;s performance from the record The pinnacle, so far, is undoubtedly the London Olympics. 16-year-old Ye Shiwen won the women&#39;s 400-meter individual medley final with a time of 4 minutes, 28 seconds and 43 seconds, breaking the world record. Then she won another gold medal for the Chinese team in the women&#39;s 200-meter individual medley final and rewrote the Olympic record. In both games, Ye Shiwen completed the reversal in the final freestyle stage at a speed far exceeding that of other players, and finally won the championship. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ye Shiwen’s main events are the 200-meter medley and the 400-meter medley. Among swimming events, the 400m is recognized as one of the most difficult and tiring events. Swimmer Michael Phelps also said that the 400-meter medley is the most difficult event and requires a lot of training. It challenges the limits of human body function. It adds together the 100-meter sprint of four swimming styles, in which speed, physical fitness, experience, and mentality are all indispensable factors. Phelps once lamented, &quot;In this competition, you can&#39;t hide.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among the four swimming styles of the 400 mixed, Ye Shiwen&#39;s butterfly and backstroke are relatively weak, and this is the 400 The first two swimming styles in the mix. Generally speaking, Ye Shiwen will fall behind in the first half of the race and overtake in the second half. The &quot;last 50 meters&quot; was Ye Shiwen&#39;s winning game, which put higher demands on her mentality, and completing the reversal required stronger mental strength. Talent, physical fitness, and experience often have objective manifestations that change over time, while mental strength is more of a subjective quality and is the athlete&#39;s own competition and pursuit. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/02/KndJaDyOTqKhFmOTvZCKgVULDuOX09HGmWUWHYA4.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/02/KndJaDyOTqKhFmOTvZCKgVULDuOX09HGmWUWHYA4.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252948&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On September 28, 2023, Chinese player Ye Shiwen competed in the women&#39;s 200-meter breaststroke final&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Xinhua News Agency/Photo)&lt;/span >;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Can’t hide&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Ye Shiwen’s self-competition really begins after reaching the peak. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As the first &quot;Grand Slam&quot; winner in Chinese swimming, Ye Shiwen maintained a winning record in the first 11 domestic and international 200-meter individual medley competitions she participated in since 2010, including the Guangzhou Asian Games. , Shanghai World Championships, London Olympics. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the London Olympics, at the 2013 Barcelona World Swimming Championships, Ye Shiwen ranked fourth in the women&#39;s 200-meter individual medley and seventh in the 400-meter individual medley, both missing medals. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ye Shiwen won the gold medal at the 2014 Incheon Asian Games, and then experienced a longer &quot;loss&quot;: at the 2015 World Championships in Kazan, she only finished 8th in the 200m individual medley and stopped in the preliminaries of the 400m. ; A year later at the Rio Olympics, her results in these two events were equally unsatisfactory; in Budapest in 2017, she even failed to enter the finals...&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;The genius girl was born&quot; Behind it is the aura of championship, but also the fear of &quot;losing&quot;. In a track that relies on go-ahead reversals, this fear seems even more difficult to overcome. Many years later, when talking about the experience of &quot;losing&quot; again, Ye Shiwen once recalled her mentality at that time to a reporter from &quot;People&quot;: &quot;I really put a lot of pressure on myself. As soon as I was pulled away by my opponent, I started to get nervous and felt No, I have to be faster than them. But as soon as I got to the backstroke, my willpower began to waver. Thinking of having to rely on freestyle to catch up so far later, I couldn&#39;t hold on, and I collapsed all of a sudden.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt; p>;With poor grades and poor condition, Ye Shiwen chose to settle down and go to Tsinghua University for further studies. During that time, she did not give up swimming. &quot;I felt that I had not reached the end of swimming. If I just gave up, I might not be able to overcome every difficulty in my life, so I still want to return to the swimming pool.&quot; Ye Shiwen once recalled in an interview. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Go back to the pool and start again. At the 2019 Gwangju World Championships, Ye Shiwen won silver medals in the 200-meter and 400-meter individual medley, and finished fourth in the 200-meter breaststroke. But in the trials before the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, Ye Shiwen failed to be selected by 0.01 seconds. Retirement became a natural association with the outside world. The talented girl who once stood at the top is troubled by physical development, age, injuries and other problems, and these troubles all point to an unknown result. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But in Ye Shiwen&#39;s world, there is no dodging. Before the Asian Games, Ye Shiwen, who had not conducted water training for a year, chose to come back for the second time in order to compete in the Hangzhou Asian Games held &quot;at home&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/02/BE7M99fPQDUrpKuUv6ghHfB5pweiTqriXrjnCAiO.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;630&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/02/BE7M99fPQDUrpKuUv6ghHfB5pweiTqriXrjnCAiO.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252949&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On September 25, 2023, in the women&#39;s 200-meter individual medley final of the Hangzhou Asian Games swimming event, Chinese player Ye Shiwen won the runner-up with a time of 2 minutes, 10 seconds and 34&lt;span style=&quot; color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Xinhua News Agency/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;The real arena&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The World Championships before the Hangzhou Asian Games, Ye Shiwen&#39;s results were not ideal, but she did not choose to leave the track, even though her first comeback ended in unsatisfactory results. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During the three years of preparing for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, Ye Shiwen chose to take a break from school and devote himself to training. No one supports her, because an athlete is an identity that is destined to end, not to mention that she once received all the glory of a professional athlete. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Are you crazy! Even Huo Su can&#39;t swim for the rest of her life?&quot; Friends and family are afraid that her comeback is out of competitiveness and anger. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I am not willing to give in. But I dropped out of school not because of any opponent, but because I wanted to overcome the fear in my heart.&quot; In 2019, Ye Shiwen told &quot;Southern People Weekly&quot; that studying in college made her I have gained some understanding of real life, &quot;I have been on a sports team since I was a child. It is too simple. In fact, life is the real arena! Study hard and live a good life. It is not easier than competing for gold and silver.&quot; (See past report &quot;&lt;a href= &quot;https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/KEBWHU4A-URAvey1OiIXWQ&quot;>;Ye Shiwen, my tears were shed in the swimming pool&lt;/a>;》)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The result was that Ye Shiwen missed the Tokyo competition. Now that she could rest, she returned to her hometown of Hangzhou. At home in Hangzhou, she followed the Tokyo Olympics throughout the entire process. On July 23, 2021, the opening day of the Tokyo Olympics, Ye Shiwen forwarded a video on Weibo. The video is an interview with her, in which she tells the story of her journey from the top of London to her failure to qualify for Tokyo, with the forward line: &quot;My life has just begun.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In that grand event, there was no Ye Shiwen&#39;s figure. But in the swimming pool, her figure never disappeared. Someone once asked her, &quot;Do you really like swimming?&quot; Ye Shiwen&#39;s answer was yes. For more swimmers, even champions, they may not really enjoy swimming. There are many athletes who become famous at a young age because of talent, physical fitness, and luck, but then have no way to escape due to aura, inertia, and external expectations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;The life of a sports team is quite boring, but I like this kind of quiet and focused devotion to a goal. I actually like being an athlete, it&#39;s very simple.&quot; Ye Shiwen chose to return to the arena. The biggest reason is that she wants to truly face herself, &quot;When you encounter difficulties, don&#39;t run away. If I run away in the swimming pool, I will run away in my studies, work, and life in the future.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Ye Shiwen did not escape, she jumped into the swimming pool again, with the mentality of a professional athlete. In the women&#39;s 200-meter medley final of the Hangzhou Asian Games, 18-year-old Yu Yiting won the championship with a record-breaking performance, and Ye Shiwen also won a silver medal. She said that there is a successor to the Chinese women&#39;s medley, which is what she &quot;most hopes to see&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;That was Ye Shiwen&#39;s first medal in the Asian Games. She was not a champion, but she already had a more determined and peaceful mentality. Ye Shiwen completed the course &quot;After Becoming a Champion&quot; with full credits. With this mentality, three days later, on September 28, Ye Shiwen won the women&#39;s 200-meter breaststroke gold medal at the Hangzhou Asian Games. It had been 9 years since her last Asian Games gold medal. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 03 Oct 2023 08:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[景迈山：世界首个茶主题世界遗产丨眼睛在旅游④]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257601]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-02 23:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 02 Oct 2023 23:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[《隐入尘烟》电影里的河西走廊，也是我所拍摄的家乡丨月是故乡明④]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257353]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-02 22:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/ 08/05/FyE2Usm65mFcDN6vTZUnhLG0OMPxdZShp2Vh7CnS.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;900&quot; height=&quot;602&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/08/05/FyE2Usm65mFcDN6vTZUnhLG0OMPxdZ Shp2Vh7CnS. jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;203988&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;December 2018, Jiayuguan, Gansu&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot; >;(Zhang Jie/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Gansu, people habitually use the Yellow River as the dividing line - the east of the Yellow River is called Hedong, and the west of the Yellow River is called Hexi.

It is the throat of the entire Silk Road and an important channel for trade and cultural exchanges between the East and the West. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/08/05/4GRVR5tdgeqSTCnOgg4P9IBGDbfMFruJII1fO29f.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;900&quot; height= &quot;601&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/08/05/4GRVR5tdgeqSTCnOgg4P9IBGDbfMFruJII1fO29f.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;203985&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;October 2019, Guazhou, Gansu&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Zhang Jie/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/08/05/91gdKoO3ekjreRGWNNEgcMrIIKdX2SZkwvTgtWbW.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;900&quot; height=&quot;602&quot; data-src=&quot;/ /images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/08/05/91gdKoO3ekjreRGWNNEgcMrIIKdX2SZkwvTgtWbW.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;203974&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center ;&quot;>;April 2021, Yumen, Gansu &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Zhang Jie/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images. infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/08/05/aXLl0LS9B879EvrqSGDlMEUWn9rsfqRiTqK7qEBX.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;900&quot; height=&quot;1350&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/ medias/image/22/08/05/aXLl0LS9B879EvrqSGDlMEUWn9rsfqRiTqK7qEBX.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;203978&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;October 2021, Gansu Guazhou&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Zhang Jie/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image /22/08/05/tzwe5MLLXjl0vHOwIGP03S0NvDbov1iyn2aW7ah8.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;900&quot; height=&quot;602&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/08/05 /tzwe5MLLXjl0vHOwIGP03S0NvDbov1iyn2aW7ah8.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;203987&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;August 2018, Jingtieshan, Gansu&lt;span style=&quot;color : #aaa;&quot;>;(Zhang Jie/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/08/05/ywwzmOjoJEQ1AuXtTot5UiRwuaFP2cshZLEVk4lv .jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;900&quot; height=&quot;601&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/08/05/ywwzmOjoJEQ1AuXtTot5UiRwuaFP2cshZLEVk4lv.jpeg&quot; data-key =&quot;203976&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;November 2020, Jiuquan, Gansu&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>; (Zhang Jie/Photo )&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Seng Yixing, an astronomer in the Tang Dynasty, said that the Qilian Mountains-Hexi Corridor is close to the &quot;Northern Commandment&quot; and is used to defend and &quot;limit the Rongdi&quot; barriers and boundaries. The Hexi Corridor-Tianshan area is not only located in the north-south dividing zone on the extension line of the Great Wall, but also serves as the east-west passage from the Central Plains to the Western Regions. It is not only the isolation zone that separates the nomadic peoples of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and the Mongolian Plateau, but also the transition zone between the &quot;Hexi Granary&quot; farming area in Gansu and the nomadic areas in Qinghai. So it is not a line, but a &quot;crossroads&quot; where north-south and east-west cross each other. Historically, on a larger scale, the Central Plains empire and the nomadic peoples confronted, interacted, and constructed each other around elastic borders, forming a &quot;dual system of agriculture and animal husbandry.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/08/05/2AxxXkUyWxYpZQLp6CWVYr3JONTnePlG8YtOgNSz.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;900&quot; height= &quot;675&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/08/05/2AxxXkUyWxYpZQLp6CWVYr3JONTnePlG8YtOgNSz.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;203973&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;March 2022, Jiayuguan, Gansu&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Zhang Jie/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src =&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/08/05/0dFpcu08D0aNI47Ww7cMuGs7iQO0nsmsTgUiADYZ.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;900&quot; height=&quot;675&quot; data-src=&quot;// images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/08/05/0dFpcu08D0aNI47Ww7cMuGs7iQO0nsmsTgUiADYZ.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;203980&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center; &quot;>;October 2019, Gansu Gaotai&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Zhang Jie/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm. com/cms/medias/image/22/08/05/2aSsHvTcfiV1Bsh3qdVHWBZC7wXL5uXnt2OEHBpr.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;900&quot; height=&quot;1350&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/ image/22/08/05/2aSsHvTcfiV1Bsh3qdVHWBZC7wXL5uXnt2OEHBpr.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;203989&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;March 2020, Jinchang, Gansu&lt; span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Zhang Jie/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;br>;The Hexi Corridor I photographed has such a unique objective geographical location and its historical and geographical status is particularly important. area, so the Hexi under the lens is not only a realistic geography, but also a geography with historical participation and influence.

Stills from &quot;It&#39;s Worth It&quot; (2023). &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Information picture/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;You can have your own name&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt; p>; Starting from early September 2023, two films known as meta-movies have appeared in theaters: Liu Jiayin&#39;s &quot;It&#39;s a Worth It&quot; and Wei Shujun&#39;s &quot;The Story of Yong&#39;an Town&quot;. Previous theaters in China include Zhang Yimou&#39;s &quot;One Second&quot;, Dapeng&#39;s &quot;Good Luck&quot;, Malaysia&#39;s Tan Cui Mei&#39;s &quot;Barbarian Invasion&quot;... Wei Shujun&#39;s next film &quot;The Mistake by the River&quot; is also said to be a meta film. The so-called meta-movies are generally considered to be &quot;movies about movies.&quot; Such films are often full of reflections on film creation and film operating mechanisms. They often have a theoretical flavor that explores film texts. Nowadays, they appear so densely in movie theaters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Thanks to the age of film maturity. With unlimited communication, high-speed transmission, and rapid and easy access to visual means, the world has become a huge studio. In such an era, the distance between ordinary audiences and meta-movies has been greatly reduced. People are more familiar than ever with how movies work. Although these recently released films still lag behind other commercial films in terms of acceptance, their appearance in theaters can already be discussed as cultural phenomena. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although &quot;It&#39;s Worth It&quot; and &quot;Stories from Yong&#39;an Town&quot; are named meta-movies, they are actually not intentional by the creators. They just filmed their own life and work experiences. out. Since they are all filmmakers, they are all caught up in confusion about movies. When they express their confusion, the movie naturally becomes a meta-movie. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The wonderful thing is that the moment when you express your confusion is also the moment when your confusion is solved. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The last film &quot;Cowhide 2&quot; directed by Liu Jiayin was completed in 2009, fourteen years ago. &quot;Cowhide 1&quot; was shortlisted for the Berlin International Film Festival and won an award, and &quot;Cowhide 2&quot; was shortlisted for the Cannes Directors&#39; Fortnight. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fourteen years of &quot;creative blankness&quot; must mean huge pressure for a filmmaker. Moreover, she is teaching at a film school and is surrounded by actors who are engaged in film creation. I often ask her, when will your next film be released? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;It&#39;s Worth It&quot; expresses this pressure in an implicit way. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is a very unique film. I remember that avant-garde experimental novels in the past sometimes did this - turning all the depression the author felt in life into the depression of the reader. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The director also knew that this was a risk, but everything was well thought out. The protagonist of &quot;It&#39;s Worth It&quot; - Wen Shan, played by Hu Ge, used to be a very unsuccessful screenwriter, and now writes memorial messages for people in a funeral home. He is very serious and responsible for his clients, and often gets into the emotional entanglement between the client and the deceased with a pedantic touch. Understanding the world and writing the right eulogy may be the goodness in his mind. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wu Lei plays Xiao Yin, a young man who lives in the same house as Wen Shan. The character is set up to be weird and ethereal. In the second half of the film, the audience suddenly realized that he was a semi-finished product, a movie character that Wen Shan, the screenwriter, had been trying to create for many years. When Wen Shan was hesitant or unsure about his creation, Xiao Yin&#39;s way of existence and sense of existence became vague and uncertain. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xiao Yin also kept asking Wen Shan, you must face your situation sincerely! He is Wenshan&#39;s alter ego - which is logical. When Wenshan smokes, he also smokes, but he only has one set of clothes. He always wears the same jacket and hat, and he never grows a beard - this is because Wenshan did not really create him . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When Wen Shan, who had gone through countless mental struggles, finally confidently said to Xiao Yin one day, &quot;You can have your own name,&quot; I heard a low exclamation burst from the middle of the audience. This low exclamation occurred in the screening hall of Beijing Film Academy, which was the place where I watched this film for the second time. Most of the audience are film students and filmmakers who are engaged in creative work, so they can better understand this relationship. Of course, I believe that those who make a career out of writing will understand the subtleties and thrills involved, and at the same time recall all the hardships they endured while creating. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;That one movie moment almost brought me to tears. How much training does it take to create a fictional character? This not only requires the talent of the creator, but also other opportunities. A character&#39;s dystocia may come from the creator&#39;s deep mental quagmire for many years. He or she may have lost self-confidence and the courage to express. Sometimes it also comes from external pressure, the industry&#39;s unique norms and access systems, and evaluations. The chaos of the system makes creators lose confidence in creation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;A Journey Worth It&quot; depicts and reflects on a very profound profile of the film creation process, revealing the subtleties of creation. Although the plot of Wen Shan writing a memorial speech takes the longest time to show in this film, what I think is the most touching is the deep affection between Wen Shan and his movie characters that contains fear. This film was able to win the Best Director and Best Actor at the 25th Shanghai International Film Festival. It seems that the inner world Liu Jiayin implanted in the film was still felt. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;A Worthwhile Journey&quot; shows an area that is not easily perceived and expressed. One detail in the film impressed me deeply: when Wen Shan was working and typing in front of the computer, the inertia of the input method made some unpleasant names often pop up on the screen. These names were the names of characters he had failed to write successfully as a screenwriter. . Although they were not born, these names were often used by Wenshan, and finally the input method remembered them. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;In Yongan Town, will nothing happen?&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The reflection on the movie in &quot;Yongan Town Stories&quot; focuses more on the interpersonal level , is also more social. Although this film without the participation of top stars may not receive a high box office compared to &quot;It&#39;s Worth It&quot;, it does not prevent it from being an equally talented film. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This film is also autobiographical. The film was inspired by Wei Shujun&#39;s experience filming his second feature film in Hunan three years ago. It is very similar to the plot shown in &quot;Story Collection of Yong&#39;an Town&quot; - in Hunan, the screenwriter and director had a conflict in the script concept. After running in, the final effect was not good, and later the two decided to overturn it and start over. This main plot was transplanted into &quot;Story Collection of Yong&#39;an Town&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Interestingly, Wei Shujun&#39;s last film &quot;Wild Horse Parting Mane&quot; (2020) is also a meta film. Both films reflect on the filmmaking process, including the studio ecology, such as filmmakers’ arrogance, chaotic work order, inappropriate power relationships in creation, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Stories of Yong&#39;an Town&quot; discusses the correspondence between film narrative and the real world in more depth than &quot;Wild Horses Part Mane&quot;: How does the movie tell the story of Yong&#39;an Town? &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the three-part structure of the film, at the beginning of the first part, the documentary director behind the scenes is waiting for the crew at the door of the hotel. He wants to record everything that happens to the crew. The crew entered Yong&#39;an Town, and the director and screenwriter came together. After settling in, some people said that Yong&#39;an Town has a peaceful beauty. The screenwriter said, doesn’t this reflect people’s powerlessness? As it says in my script - nothing will happen in Yong&#39;an Town. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;“Nothing will happen in Yongan Town” is a theme that the screenwriter constantly emphasizes in his scripts, which reflects his understanding and judgment of Yongan Town. However, the director did not agree with the screenwriter&#39;s judgment and asked the screenwriter to make modifications based on realistic logic and character logic. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A major contradiction quickly emerged. The director and screenwriter are competing for the right to interpret Yong&#39;an Town, or the right to interpret reality. Wing On became a symbol of reality itself. The development and unfolding of this contradiction will eventually be realized in: &quot;In Yong&#39;an Town, will nothing happen?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the first paragraph, a landlady who provides food for the crew appears. The proprietress is often accompanied by an old woman. The old woman sits in the shop like a sculpture. It seems to be in line with the screenwriter&#39;s imagination of Yong&#39;an Town: stationary, losing mobility, and nothing will happen to her. Once, the screenwriter met the boss’s wife and asked her to recite his wise words in dialect. When the boss’s wife said, “Nothing will happen in Yong’an Town,” the screenwriter laughed happily. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But the old woman who had been motionless suddenly moved her aging body out of her original position with the help of a chair with wheels. This scene happened quietly, but it seemed to prove that something &quot;happened&quot;. This scene delicately reflects the cultural hegemony and certain transgression of artists (such as screenwriters) over local people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So, what is the attitude of the movie? Will nothing happen in Yongan Town? The young proprietress is breastfeeding, and her husband works as an online ride-hailing driver, leaving her to take care of the child at night. During the day, she also helps her parents-in-law manage the restaurant, which is the family business she will inherit in the future. This woman was firmly imprisoned in this family structure, and it seemed that nothing would happen to her. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She was excited by the arrival of the crew, and she saw a new possibility - she made a prompt decision, weaned her child, and went to the street to get a manicure. This was her action. But the producer quickly brought in the female star Chen Chen to play the role that the boss lady longed for. Her movie dream was shattered. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although the boss lady&#39;s actions were unsuccessful, she cannot deny the power of action she once had. However, the unsuccessful ending is a serious blow to the actors. Such a small town story is indeed unable to inspire people&#39;s action. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The protagonist of the second paragraph, the female star Chen Chen, actually walked out of Yongan Town. Chen Chen was warmly welcomed by her old classmates, but she did not enjoy the feeling of being respected. She was &quot;kidnapped&quot; to cut ribbons for others for free. The local officials were vulgar and had no respect for women. What made Chen Chen feel cordial was his old friend Chen Hong. Chen Hong&#39;s wife invited her to have dinner at home, but this meal put Chen Chen in an embarrassing situation. The other party actually wanted to use her as a back door to send their children to the crew to be actors. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Chen Hong and his wife are played by Yang Jin and Wang Jiajia, who are also husband and wife in reality. Wang Jiajia portrays a middle-aged woman in a small town very vividly. She is vulgar and shrewd, and successfully ruins the relationship between her husband and his old lover. All the good feelings. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Chen Chen fled from this swamp-like family in a hurry. She said to her old classmate: &quot;I didn&#39;t expect you to become like this!&quot; Chen Hong said: &quot;You said you missed life here during the day! You are famous now Didn&#39;t you just leave because of money?&quot; Chen Chen said, &quot;The reason why I left was because I didn&#39;t want to live like your wife!&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The screenwriter believed that Chen Chen left Yong&#39;an Town just for money. Rather than a female awakening, Chen Hong&#39;s explanation for Chen Chen&#39;s behavior was actually the same as the screenwriter&#39;s. It can be seen that the screenwriter&#39;s understanding of life is not entirely based on subjective assumptions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But Chen Chen defended herself, saying that she left because of her awakening. These are two interpretations of Yongan Town. The voices of the two Yongan Town residents are the voices of Yongan Town itself, which means that Yongan Town itself is a chaotic and sticky place. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Facing the same external target, why do the two main creators have such different views? The third paragraph focuses on the two main creators who have been arguing and begins to analyze the source of their differences in concepts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Screenwriters like hand-rolled cigarettes, but directors don’t like hand-rolled cigarettes. They attack each other&#39;s music hobbies. The director likes RAP and pursues Spike Lee&#39;s style. The screenwriter thinks that those who like RAP are just pretending. They sing to show how awesome they are. He prefers rock and classical music. When the director played Chopin&#39;s music, the screenwriter said, &quot;As soon as this music played, I felt like I was in Yong&#39;an Town.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The screenwriter wrote about a boy chasing a girl playing the violin and arriving at her building. But there was no action at the end. The director thought it was too literary, and the characters could not do without action. The screenwriter said that this story is his experience, and he once chased girls like this. &quot;The life I understand is that people don&#39;t take so many actions! They live by expectations.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Everyone has a strong ego and feels that the signal received by the antenna above their head Most accurate. This movie wrote a paper called &quot;On the Origin of Differences in Creative Concepts&quot; in a perceptual way, maybe more than one. The third paragraph actually gives part of the answer. The difference comes from experience and temperament. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The screenwriter rewrote the script based on the exchange between the two, but the director found that the script was riddled with holes and completely lost its filming value. They threw the script on the floor and lost their minds. At this moment when the conflict was heating up, the director did not seek to resolve the conflict head-on, but designed a moment of metaphysical transcendence. At this time, the WeChat ringtone rang, and everyone received the same news: Maradona was dead. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The music of &quot;Don&#39;t Cry for Me Argentina&quot; enveloped everyone, including Chen Hong and his wife, and the hotel proprietress. Everyone transcended and sublimated at that moment, and the contradictions in the script were obviously transcended. Unsolved is better than solved. The main creators wanted to solve the problems of this film creation in a higher dimension. They decided to overthrow it and start over. The end of the film was the opening ceremony of the film &quot;The Story of Yong&#39;an Town&quot; and they started a new film. action. They channeled the conflict between director and screenwriter into their new film. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/0DiAOLGk9Wx2g67iGWbS9SbBOKB3s1fCfUsq3cq5.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;657&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/0DiAOLGk9Wx2g67iGWbS9SbBOKB3s1fCfUsq3cq5.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252161&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&quot;Stories of Yong&#39;an Town&quot; tells the story of a crew stationed in Yong&#39;an Town to shoot a movie. Stills from &quot;Stories of Yong&#39;an Town&quot; (2021). &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Information picture/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Does the movie faithfully represent reality? &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Wei Shujun’s ability to control narrative can not only bring the narrative in depth, but also quickly break away and transcend. This degree of control and narrative balance reflect a rare talent. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Story Collection of Yong&#39;an Town&quot; creates a textual maze. The film features four or five directors in roles, and three sections are titled after several Chinese arthouse films. Behind every director, there are their works and texts, and intertextual relationships can be formed between texts. This contains a certain amount of interest. Do you want to interpret it in depth? Of course you can, but the arrangement and combination of texts will create a kind of textual abyss. Perhaps a vague association will suffice here. The most important thing is the &quot;skill&quot; part of &quot;Yong&#39;an Town Story Collection&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The so-called era of film maturity means that film works have been textualized. The connotation of replacing &quot;work&quot; with &quot;text&quot; is a comprehensive reflection and questioning of traditional creative concepts. The work means the close correspondence between the author and the work, the work and reality, the author and reality, etc. That relationship is now being called into question. Does the movie faithfully represent reality? The producer constantly interferes and influences the creation. Is the director really the author of the film? Is the director staying true to reality? Or does he have the ability to accurately understand life? Film production has a strong impurity that can spiral out of control at any time. This can be seen as the inspiration of &quot;Story Collection of Yong&#39;an Town&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Meta-movies are the textual movies mentioned above. This concept is actually not translated well enough, but let’s use it that way, and what I want to discuss here is a new large-scale trend in the field of Chinese film. How do we evaluate this trend? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wei Shujun&#39;s last film &quot;Wild Horse Parting Mane&quot; was also a meta film. I remember some commentators thought that the director was too narcissistic. They shouted to Wei Shujun - there is more to life than movies! I understand the commentator&#39;s attitude, but I think it pathologizes Wei Shujun&#39;s creative tendencies. I don&#39;t want to see it this way. As for &quot;Wild Horse Parting Mane&quot;, although it is a meta-movie that captures the director&#39;s own life, it also contains profound social analysis and social criticism. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The age of film maturity does not only mean that people have watched enough films, are familiar with film history, film allusions, and understand the mystery of intertextuality; it also does not only refer to their life time and film in a broad sense. There are more overlaps and more daily communication through the form of movies in a broad sense... What’s more, we are already familiar with the cultural mechanisms of films, from studio production to ideological operating mechanisms; it means that at the moment, technology and media The &quot;wave of self-imaging&quot; brought to us by the development of the Internet has swept through each of our lives and reconstructed the organizational form and experience mode of our lives - think about the comeback of private images, think about Douyin and folk promotions The spontaneous performance of the actor...&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The age of film maturity is also when all film forms seem to have been exhausted. People are rethinking the possibilities of film, including rethinking the development of new technologies, and rethinking film and reality. The relationship between... We are already in an era of intense film reflection and new film ontology, which constructs a new cultural spirit of our time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The production of &quot;It&#39;s Worth It&quot; and &quot;Stories of Yong&#39;an Town&quot; have clues about the creator&#39;s original life that can be traced, but they also have the macro background of an era when movies are mature. Although these films are full of self-reference and discussion of the ontology of film, they are not outside of historical time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 02 Oct 2023 21:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[做人生转折时刻的强者：不作无谓的精神消耗，而是活在意义之中]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257940]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-02 20:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;People have different attitudes and approaches when encountering major turning points. Most people panic and are in a dilemma. In contrast, the narrative of a Weibo blogger gives people a refreshing and enlightening feeling, which is quite enlightening. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This Weibo blogger recounted that her husband’s unemployment happened suddenly. In the morning, he was still complaining about too many people on the subway and was a few minutes late. Then he sent her a message saying: I was in a meeting and something was wrong. Condition. It turned out that after their project was launched, there were so many bad reviews that his boss was completely heartbroken. After a weekend of thinking, he decided to dissolve the company immediately. While there was still money in the company&#39;s books, more than 200 people in the company were given N+1 Everyone rushes towards their own future. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course this is a responsible boss who treats his employees well enough, but for the workers, the bleak ending is already a fact. Her first reaction was that although the incident was sudden, unemployment was a foregone conclusion and she needed to plan for the next step immediately. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Their rent in Beijing just ends on September 30. She came to his company to confirm: disbandment is a foregone conclusion. After completing the formalities today, she won’t have to go to work tomorrow. She got N+1 beautifully. The two then spent 10 minutes analyzing the pros and cons, and decided to discuss it with the landlord, quit the rent on the 30th, and move back to Chengdu before the National Day. Next, he went to resign, and she contacted the landlord and the agent, explained the situation, and went through the check-in procedures for the two cats. She also immediately placed an order for the cartons, tape, plastic wrap and other things needed for the move and had them delivered in the same city. Then I announced to my close friends that I was leaving Beijing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is the standard performance of a time management master: when he left the company at 15:00, she had already made a list of what things at home needed to be unused and what things should be kept for return to Chengdu. . At 17:00, the agent came to take photos. She canceled her flight and hotel booking to Seoul for the weekend and rebooked her flight back to Chengdu. Around 19:00, she was already posting like crazy in the community’s idle group. At 20:00, she called two other more experienced good friends to help her husband revise his resume and teach him interview experience for the next job, because he had not moved around since graduation and had no experience in finding a job. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;This is my attitude towards life. Now that I have decided, there is no need to delay for one more second. Look forward, the sooner the better.&quot; Her emotion triggered the reaction of many netizens. Sadness and sympathy. In the face of such a thrilling fate, how could a person calmly make a handover with fate in just a few minutes? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;More than 20 years ago, I once &quot;drifted to the North&quot; for several months. In order to compete for a position in a magazine, for a whole month, I went from &quot;audition&quot; to &quot;audition&quot; among hundreds of people. Semi-finals&quot; and even the 4-person &quot;finals&quot;. When I finally lost my job opportunity with another &quot;unlucky guy&quot; because I didn&#39;t have a college degree, I was immersed in the emotions of shock, dissatisfaction, and unwillingness. It took a long time before I hesitated and went south in frustration. Compared with this &quot;time management master&quot;&#39;s never-procrastinating style, I am really ashamed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are always disappointments in life, and unemployment is just one of them. When people reach middle age, some people get divorced, lose their spouses, lose their close friends, or encounter other unfortunate things. It’s not surprising to feel down and up and down at this point. So people often advise &quot;caged people&quot; to go out and relax. It has to be said that traveling far away does help to relieve the mood. However, regardless of whether you have the intention to go out, even if you go out, the troubles hanging in the air will continue to affect your mood. Didn’t you see that some of the wanderers became even more depressed after they came back? Therefore, this method of shelving conflicts and pain and adjusting time and space is not the best solution. The best solution is actually &quot;long-term pain is worse than short-term pain&quot;, do whatever you need to do, and never be sloppy or indecisive. The aforementioned blogger set an example. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Objectively, because the blogger was mentally prepared and built up for her husband&#39;s unemployment, instead of being suddenly laid off, when the moment did come, the blow he suffered was naturally less severe. What&#39;s more, since the compensation can be described as generous, it has also greatly relieved the bitter taste. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But this is not the key reason why he can maintain a calm and free style in times of turmoil. The key reason is to &quot;cut through the mess with a quick knife.&quot; Whether it is dealing with large or small matters and trivial matters, or making an immediate decision to move, it all reflects the philosophy of using speed to make things easier, and using pain to get rid of pain. Turning pages so quickly can minimize the impact of shock. Selling away most of the company-related artifacts is also to erase traces of the old job as soon as possible and reduce memory trauma. It is conceivable that at that time, their minds were occupied with other important things, so how could they squeeze in the pain? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It can be thought from this that modern people are greatly superior to the ancients in terms of material living conditions. But why does it seem that our stress is much greater than that of people in the past? Why do so many people seem to be depressed today? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, today we are indeed in a state of &quot;volume&quot; in many affairs, and pressure exists objectively, but have we ever thought about this problem: The ancients were often busy planning for rice every day, and rarely did they have to worry about it. I have free time to think about things, so much so that I have to &quot;steal&quot; even &quot;half a day&#39;s free time&quot;. Nowadays, people have more leisure in a materially rich environment. Once people are free, it is easy to get stuck in a corner and be unable to get out, amplifying the pressure. In fact, today, our situation is much better. For example, although the journey to school is extremely difficult, fortunately, examination or selection information is becoming more and more transparent, and at least there is certainty after studying hard, which is much better than in the past when imposters and secret operations were frequent. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, leisure and non-idle are only relative, and how to deal with problems in specific circumstances also varies from person to person. However, no matter what era you are in, if you want to get out of trouble, people are given requirements and needs. The tactics adopted are actually the same, that is, the more extraordinary the period, the more meaningful things to do and the more meaningful issues to think about. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When you become stronger in this changing situation because of your timely stop loss and seeking changes, how heavy will the troubles of a person in a unit be? When a person can make himself bigger and stronger at the macro level of life - for example, becoming a person with a skill in his spare time and establishing extraordinary influence in a certain field - at this time, in a small space, because of interpersonal relationships and Can the waves caused by income disputes have a fatal impact on him? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Specifically speaking, in the context of life transitions, it means not to consume unnecessary energy, but to live in meaning. On the basis of acknowledging reality, turn around quickly and move from one state of affairs (stage) to the other as quickly as possible. Entering another state of affairs (stage), self-stimulating upward courage, it is too late and there is no time to feel sorry for yourself. This is the &quot;sharp weapon&quot; that the strong keep secret. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（本文仅为作者个人观点，不代表本报立场）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;获取更多RSS：&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 02 Oct 2023 20:25:21 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[戴佩妮：写歌根本就是老天爷要我做的事情]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258000]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-02 19:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/27/xDUbigKtQgtDIq3lncCbMYixioK3gMnfPWRa24AO.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/xDUbigKtQgtDIq3lncCbMYixioK3gMnfPWRa2 4AO. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252435&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Penny Dai in &quot;Time Concert·Friends&quot;&lt;span style=&quot;color: # aaa;&quot;>;(Photo provided by the program team)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the Chinese music scene in 2000, a 22-year-old girl made her debut by releasing an album with original songs. In the mature record industry system What are the chances of finding a way out? Dai Penni told the audience through her actions that she might not be able to become an instant hit, but her talent will be recognized. The proof of this is the &quot;Nomination for the Best Newcomer Award at the 12th Golden Melody Awards.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When the time since his debut was extended to 23 years, and the purely original album was released to his 13th, the singer entered another evaluation system, which consists of various criteria such as persistence, resilience, and having ideas. It seems that he can Separated from worldly judgments such as market and sales, the base is stacked with time and works. The &quot;status in the world&quot; shows the scarcity of music and the longevity of talent. Dai Penni is firmly on top, resting in a corner. She said: &quot;Writing songs is basically what God wants me to do.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She seems to have been accustomed to her situation: writing some songs that dig deeper into herself, and having a stable group of people who work with her The fans who grew up lived a contented life. As she said: &quot;I have always been a nobody, living a life where second place doesn&#39;t matter.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Penny Dai&#39;s most popular clips on the Internet were presented by fans in an almost joking way. A few years ago, she sang her masterpiece &quot;How&quot; live, and handed the microphone to a fan. The other fan grabbed the picture, went out of tune, and burst out laughing in the middle of the song. She was stunned, took back the microphone, and finished singing this sad love song while holding her thighs. After singing, she was not annoyed and told the other party gently: &quot;Feixiang &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(fan&#39;s name)&lt;/span>;, keep up with the time.&quot;&lt; /p>; &lt;p>;This less than two-minute clip was made into various videos and emoticons and went viral on various platforms. It was dubbed by some media as &quot;probably the most popular day since Dai Penny&#39;s debut.&quot; Until now, many people have seen Dai Penny staring at fans with complicated expressions, but they have not listened to the full song &quot;How&quot; she sang at that time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Penny Dai’s life is littered with similar jokes of fate: she has written hundreds of songs, but still can’t read music. Her explanation for this was: &quot;This is a talent and a mission.&quot; She made up her mind to enter the music scene, and the first song she released was called &quot;Don&#39;t Want to&quot;. She was nominated for the Golden Melody Award for Best Female Singer many times, but she missed it every time and always regretted it. The album that finally won the award was called &quot;Purely Accident.&quot; She loves female singer Ani DiFranco. This pioneer in the original music industry has a unique personality and follows absolute DIY principles. He founded a record company to release his own solo album. Since his debut, he has been competing with the mainstream because of his clear views and controversy. While yearning for it, Dai Penni wrote about her endless self and subtle emotions in her songs, becoming part of the mainstream - being two extremes from being an idol. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One thing that is good about original singers is that the audience does not have to work hard to outline the singer&#39;s mood and story from the twists and turns of lyrics and music, especially for a creator like Dai Penni, who uses direct or indirect life experience as a Based on the original creation, the expression is strong and direct. &quot;My songs are my diaries,&quot; she said. With more than a dozen albums arranged by year, Dai Penni has been along the way. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Looking at Dai Penny&#39;s music career, we can find that she is really full of energy. In addition to her dozen albums and hundreds of songs, she also has a large amount of unreleased inventory. In 2011, she gathered her friends to form the rock band Buddha Jump Over the Wall, serving as the lead singer. With her first album &quot;Buddha Jump&quot;, she was nominated for the Best Band Award at the 23rd Golden Melody Awards; her second album &quot;Show You&quot; won the 2015 Golden Melody Awards. Won the Best Arranger and Best Orchestra awards. She helped write lyrics and music for Peng Jiahui, Xu Guanghan, Pingguan, Jiang Meiqi, Liu Sihan and others. She won the Best Album Producer Award at the 25th Golden Melody Awards for the album &quot;Embrace You&quot; produced for Liu Sihan. In addition, she has also served as music video director and album photographer. Before her debut, she once wanted to become a professional dancer. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Penny Tai was born into a scholarly family in Malaysia and started learning dance in the fourth grade of primary school. In high school, she participated in the first music competition in her life. She adapted a text written by a friend into a song and made it to the finals. The winner of that competition was later musician A Niu, and Leung Jingru won the Best Performance Award. Also participating were Zhang Zhicheng and Fang Jiongbin, who later became Dai Penny&#39;s few friends in the industry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In September 2023, Dai Penni participated in the recording of Hunan Satellite TV&#39;s program &quot;Time Concert·Friends&quot;. In the previous four episodes, she invited her friend Zhang Zhicheng, who competed with her, and producer Yaya, who has been working with her for many years. She said that she doesn’t have many friends, but if anyone needs her, she will definitely stand up. “My loyalty can be exaggerated, and sometimes I forget that I am a girl.” In the program, they looked back on the past and pulled back the time to a long time ago. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During the competition in high school, she caught the attention of musicians Chen Zihong and Huang Yi, signed up to &quot;Like Music&quot;, and released her first solo album &quot;Penny&quot; the following year. Until the release of her second album &quot;How&quot;, she had not decided whether to be a singer-songwriter or a professional dancer in the future. The song &quot;The Love You Want&quot; from the album was recommended by the company as the ending song for the TV series &quot;Meteor Garden&quot; and resounded throughout the streets as the TV series became popular. As she walked on the street, audience members came to say hello, &quot;For the first time, I felt like I was recognized by everyone because of my music.&quot; The energy of this song lasted for many years, and it is still one of her masterpieces. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Penny Dai’s music has rich genres and diverse emotions, which is one of her attractive features. She said: &quot;I&#39;m really vulnerable when I&#39;m vulnerable. I can be soft and strong. I don&#39;t hold back. I cry when I need to cry, feel sad when I need to be sad, and be fierce when I need to be fierce. Just like my lyrics, these Song just cut me open for you to see, without reservation.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/nVi6rXdNtNPN8bTDlIET40hATrkyb30SMVgcJdlW .jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/nVi6rXdNtNPN8bTDlIET40hATrkyb30SMVgcJdlW.jpg&quot; data-key =&quot;252432&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In &quot;Time Concert·Friends&quot;, Dai Penni and her friend Zhang Zhicheng sang &quot;Three O&#39;clock in the Morning&quot;&lt; span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Provided by the program team/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Every song of mine has a secret - Dialogue with Dai Penni&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt; strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Why did you participate in the recording of &quot;Time Concert·Friends&quot;? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Penny Dai: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I was a flying guest in the first season and sang a cover of &quot;Coward&quot;. In fact, I was very afraid of singing the cover. But the atmosphere was very warm at the time, and Mr. Arai’s team was also very good. I was also invited to be a flying guest in the second season, but I missed it because I had Yang. This season is &quot;Friends&quot;, and the content has been changed to find your best friends, which attracts me even more. Through this program, I can let everyone know more about my friends who have been on the music road for more than 20 years and how they have helped and influenced me. I have very little exposure and rarely talk to people about these things. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I am not afraid of strangers and make friends easily. But until now, since my debut, I have very few real good friends as an artist. Most of them are the staff behind the scenes, the producers, costumers, etc. who shoot the MV. Stylist, makeup artist, music teacher, so I also want to use this show to make friends and learn about other musicians’ musical journeys. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/BF0w2SdlxmEpTSofejPSmEzZ3N3prWLOD7UhKyo1.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;591&quot; height= &quot;523&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/BF0w2SdlxmEpTSofejPSmEzZ3N3prWLOD7UhKyo1.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252431&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Penny&#39;s first full creation in 2000&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly: &lt; /strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Is it because we rarely become friends with artists because we have less opportunities to chat? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Penny Dai: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I have some bad experiences. As long as I treat the other person as a friend, I will stand up for the other person when they need me. I will definitely show up. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I am not very clingy with my friends. The friends we met in the early days were not like today. Now everyone makes friends through Moments, but the content shared in Moments may not necessarily be what he really wants to say. I don’t reject the idea of ​​a circle of friends. I used to have a circle of friends, but I rarely posted them. I was always looking at them. As I watched them, I began to speculate or worry about the other person (whether something was wrong). I felt that this was actually not very healthy. Gradually, I followed my previous approach and closed the circle of friends. If you have anything to say, we&#39;ll talk to you face to face. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I am both passive and active, and I am very willing to take the initiative to help others, but if he doesn&#39;t mention it or doesn&#39;t let me know, I will feel that he doesn&#39;t need me at this moment, and I don&#39;t need to be too &quot;chicken bitch&quot; , I have to take care of others. The friends around me now will come to me if they really need some advice, but I don’t think I need to be so enthusiastic that I can take the initiative to ask. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/TxAvFrk8RV2VqY6CM4ElzKo5Q8OQKF0DqhIvX47D.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;536&quot; height= &quot;746&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/TxAvFrk8RV2VqY6CM4ElzKo5Q8OQKF0DqhIvX47D.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252437&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&quot;Purely Accident&quot; 2013&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/ strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;When will this mentality change be completed? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Penny Dai: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;In 2017, I wrote &quot;Passive Audience&quot;. I deeply feel that even though I have very few contacts with people, I will still be hurt by rumors. I want to resolve this misunderstanding spread by word of mouth. In the end, neither party can be friends. All my intentions are kind. In the end, you will be distorted and you will feel like what are you doing? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We won’t talk about the specific incident. Anyway, my trust and understanding of people and interpersonal communication collapsed in an instant. Many things and people would change, so I later opened up. Passive mode, this is also the homework I need to do. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/y7Ad7ElXm2PjhPPDPUVT0fbuJalNQSwmVFihrlC0.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;460&quot; height= &quot;366&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/y7Ad7ElXm2PjhPPPDPUVT0fbuJalNQSwmVFihrlC0.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252430&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&quot;Thief&quot; 2016&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>; &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;But by 2017 it has been almost 20 years since you debuted. Has it been so long since you have been in the industry that you feel the power of rumors? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Penny Dai: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Actually, you should rarely hear much from me. I rarely go out. Why aren’t my things being shared on social media? It’s because I feel bored. I’m not practicing or eating well at home. I won’t share who my friends are over the years. I am very protective of my circle of friends and my life, because for me, my life is my creation. Well... my songwriting is already a part of my life. From my debut until now, people have been guessing my appearance through my songs. This is natural. &quot;A person who doesn&#39;t often share too much about his life.&quot; In the circle I live in, it may be very contradictory for a person who wants to be exposed or publicized, but I just have this kind of rebellious personality. I don’t think this environment can only accept the existence of one type of artist or one type of business model. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/ICY90xMKpkkZtKafCIbLZwq7whvIOCsxqivBS2IT.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 540&quot; height=&quot;540&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/ICY90xMKpkkZtKafCIbLZwq7whvIOCsxqivBS2IT.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252429&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&quot;Passive Audience&quot; 2022&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Characters Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;If you don’t want to expose your personal life, there are quite a few reality show parts in this show, and there are a lot of self-revealing parts. . Don&#39;t you care? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Penny Dai: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;In the show, I am sharing my music life. I don’t mind this part. I will not take the initiative to tell everyone that I am in the show every day. Why, but when I meet fate and meet friends, I will talk freely. So this goes back to what I just said, I am not afraid of strangers or making friends, I am very willing to share. It’s just that I use music to share more than making friends to sit down and share with everyone. My life is my music, but I don’t want to just use social media to share my life. I hope I can find a more appropriate platform. I think this program is a very comfortable platform to talk about music. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I have written all the most important things in the song, and I have already cut myself open enough. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, the content written by some singer-songwriters may not necessarily be their own (experiences), but I choose to be a narrative singer-songwriter. I feel that I feel deeply and I only write when I have something to say. That&#39;s why I tell everyone that my songs are my diaries. I don’t like keeping diaries, but I love writing songs. Every song has people, things, things, and every song has secrets that you don’t know, yes, only I know. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;What does secret mean? For example, what&#39;s the secret in &quot;The Love You Want&quot;? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Penny Dai: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;It refers to a lot of code words in words, which are things that only I understand. &quot;The Love You Want&quot; is relatively straightforward. The funniest thing about it is that the big boy in this song is actually me. It was a very young love affair, and I was too strictly controlled, so I wanted to be like a big boy and be free. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So in fact its story is not what you think, it is the other way around, but no one knows it. As the person who sings it, everyone will definitely think that I have met a boy who wants to be free. No. But I don’t want to explain this thoroughly. It’s like some movies where you don’t know whether the ending is happy or bad. In fact, it’s an open ending, and many things just need to be stopped. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, &quot;How&quot; is obviously a touching love song, but it was changed into another style by a handsome fan friend of mine, and I didn&#39;t expect this change. I didn&#39;t know it at all. This change will occur. But I am loyal to the reason why I wrote this song in the first place. The changes in my life and things will not affect the picture in my mind when I sing this song. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many people are worried that I can no longer sing this song, no. When I sang this song, I knew what secrets I was hiding. I knew the time, place, and people. Of course, there would still be funny scenes when we talked about it, but it would not affect the reason why I wrote this song in the first place. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;How do you think you have improved in writing lyrics and music over the years? ? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Penny Dai: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I think it is the time that has given me different perspectives on things and different interpretations, and the words I use are different. So for me it’s not just aging, it’s maturing. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I didn’t know how to use the word “nurture” before. Later, I heard a senior say that I think this word is very good, because different environments will cultivate different personalities. . Therefore, the word &quot;nurture&quot; has been used frequently in the past two years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It was only after I finished the song &quot;Passive Audience&quot; that I learned to make peace with myself and often have meetings with myself. I was often in a state of binary opposition before. I would be worried about a lot of things at once, and I couldn&#39;t find the answers, so I started asking people for help. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I wrote the song &quot;I Yearn&quot; in the album to remind myself. I have participated in so many programs in the past three years, and I am very afraid that I will go astray and forget my original intention. So I wrote this song to remember what I yearned for, &quot;The days I yearn for have sunrises, and the mess I yearn for is taken care of by you.&quot; By the second paragraph, I started writing and realized that my mentality had changed, so this song The song is to remind yourself not to get lost by filling in the gaps in reality. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You said you couldn’t make a decision before, so you started asking people everywhere, But your songs show that you seem to be a very courageous person. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Penny Dai: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Things that are bold are very bold, and things that are not bold are not bold. I am very decisive now when it comes to big things. Now I use very unscientific methods to make decisions, such as throwing coins. My life is destined to be good, and the more I think about it, the less likely it will be. My whole life has been unintentional. I can only sum it up with this sentence. At the age of 45, from the beginning I didn’t want to be a singer-songwriter and just gave it a try, and now I have followed this path, and it feels like I was destined to do it. If the first album doesn&#39;t work, I&#39;m going to go back to dancing or something, no, it&#39;s just going to be like this. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I can only admit that this is my mission. There are many people who can sing well, look good, and can create better than me, but not everyone can eat this. Have a meal. What makes me happiest is that my hobby is my job. I do things that interest me every day. At the same time, I can empower others through song, or give them a place to find release. This is the identity belt I have now. It gives me, supports me, and is the main reason why I still want to come out and sing and chat with everyone no matter how tired I am. Because this is basically what God wants me to do. If he didn&#39;t want me to do it, he would have asked me to go home and dance on the first album (after the album). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/xkHR1nMNeASpTkionE5GrJKnAOtgxeTdAMM8TkMs.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/xkHR1nMNeASpTkionE5GrJKnAOtgxeTdAMM8TkMs.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252433&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In &quot;Time Concert·Friends&quot;, Dai Penni plays games with Yu Wenwen (left) and Meng Jia (right)&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>; (Provided by the program team/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;If this It is a kind of mission. Have you ever thought about making it more vivid? For example, like your favorite singer-songwriter Ani DiFranco, write some songs that are closer to social reality and grand narratives, instead of always exploring the emotions of individual stories? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Penny Dai: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;How do you know I don’t have one?
