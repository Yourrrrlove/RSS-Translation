A recent news has once again attracted attention to the green channel policy for agricultural products. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the Morning News, recently, when a truck driver, Mr. Li, was driving off the expressway from Nanying, Yicheng City, Hubei Province, he was told that the purple sweet potato he was pulling was not in the catalog of fresh agricultural products, and he was charged 900 yuan. Travel expenses. When he got off the expressway from Nanchang, Jiangxi and Ezhou, Hubei, the toll collectors believed that purple sweet potatoes were fresh agricultural products and could enjoy the green channel policy for agricultural products without charging tolls. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Mr. Li was puzzled by this and posted a video complaint online. In this regard, the person in charge of Nanying Toll Station said that they strictly follow the &quot;Catalogue of Fresh Agricultural Products Varieties&quot; formulated by the Ministry of Transport, the National Development and Reform Commission, the Ministry of Finance, and the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs. Purple sweet potato is not in the catalog. Therefore, you cannot enjoy the green pass policy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It seems that this explanation makes sense. A notice issued by the four ministries and commissions at the end of 2022 stated that &quot;sweet potato&quot; is one of the fresh vegetables that can enjoy the green pass policy, and the &quot;aliases and common trade names&quot; of sweet potato include &quot;sweet potato, sweet potato, white potato, sweet potato, sweet potato, sweet potato, red taro&quot; &quot;Wait, &quot;Purple Sweet Potato&quot; is indeed not among them. The Ministry of Transport also made it clear when responding to inquiries on the official website that &quot;purple sweet potatoes&quot; are not included in the &quot;Catalogue of Fresh Agricultural Products Varieties&quot; and are not agricultural products that enjoy the preferential policies of the &quot;green channel&quot;. However, this reply was made in October 2020, 2 years earlier than the new notice at the end of 2022. From this reply alone, we cannot conclude that &quot;the 2022 version of the new fresh agricultural product catalog does not include purple sweet potatoes.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the domestic trade industry standard SB/T10029-2012 &quot;Fresh Vegetable Classification and Code&quot; issued by the Ministry of Commerce, sweet potato (also known as potato, sweet potato, sweet potato) and purple potato are indeed divided into different categories. But they are all &quot;fresh vegetables&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although the catalog of fresh agricultural products refers to the industry standards of the Ministry of Commerce, it lists more aliases for sweet potatoes in order to minimize possible disputes. However, sweet potatoes and purple potatoes are similar in appearance. The only difference is that purple potatoes are purple in color, and they are both fresh vegetables according to the standards of the Ministry of Commerce. Why do they enjoy different treatment? No wonder disputes often arise. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, if we strictly follow botanical classification, the standards of the Ministry of Commerce and the catalog of fresh agricultural products published by the four ministries may not be accurate. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to information from the website &quot;Plant Intelligence&quot; hosted by the Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences, sweet potato, commonly known as sweet potato, belongs to the genus Magnoliaceae-Lily subclass-Dioscoreales-Dioscoreaceae-Dioscorea in plant taxonomy. A species. The scientific name of the commonly known &quot;sweet potato&quot; is actually &quot;sweet potato&quot;, which is a species under the genus Magnoliacea-Rosoda-Solanales-Convolvulaceae-Tiger Palm Vine. Sweet potatoes also have common names such as goose, white potato, sweet potato, sweet potato, sweet potato, yam, sweet potato, potato, jade pillow potato, Tang potato, red potato, red yam, Ganchu, fanru, golden potato, sweet potato, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to this, although sweet potato and sweet potato are often considered to be different common names for the same plant in daily life, from a botanical classification point of view, sweet potato and sweet potato belong to different subclasses and are actually very distantly related. of two species. On the contrary, sweet potatoes and morning glories belong to the genus Tiger Palm and are close relatives. Purple sweet potato is only a subspecies of sweet potato in botanical classification. According to the common name, it should be included in &quot;sweet potato&quot;. Sweet potato is one of the common names of sweet potato, and taxonomically speaking, sweet potato and sweet potato are two very different species, which is indeed confusing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although &quot;purple potatoes are not sweet potatoes&quot;, &quot;hot peppers are not peppers&quot;, &quot;baby cabbage is not cabbage&quot;, &quot;cherries are not cherries&quot; and &quot;cherry tomatoes are not tomatoes&quot; often cause ridicule on social networks, but these The differences between the different names of fresh crops in botany, the Ministry of Commerce’s trade standards, the catalog of fresh agricultural products, and the public’s daily cognition are not the root cause of the dispute over the Green Pass policy. Many times, even for agricultural products whose variety classification is not controversial, toll stations will refuse to implement the green pass policy on the grounds of &quot;not fresh&quot; or &quot;extensively processed&quot; and require payment of fees. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Why do toll stations try to find ways to charge card drivers and not give free access to agricultural product transport vehicles? The reason is naturally to reduce losses as much as possible. Currently, the tolls exempted from the green pass for agricultural products are borne by highway operating companies. This is not a small amount of money. According to the &quot;2021 National Toll Road Statistical Bulletin&quot; released by the Ministry of Transport, the &quot;green channel&quot; of national toll roads will reduce tolls by 27.47 billion yuan in 2021, and the reduction in 2019 will reach 35.08 billion yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The green pass policy was introduced by the state to reduce the circulation costs of agricultural products. The expenses thus reduced should have been borne by the government. In 2009, the Ministry of Transport and the National Development and Reform Commission stated in relevant notices on the comprehensive implementation of the green toll policy that the impact of green tolls on commercial toll road companies should be studied, and those with a greater impact would be compensated as appropriate; new batches of tolls When building highway projects, the impact of green traffic must be fully considered and traffic flow reasonably determined. In 2019, relevant ministries and commissions once again proposed to conduct an in-depth assessment of the implementation effects and impacts of the green pass policy, and formulate specific plans to compensate for the loss of legitimate income of toll road operating units caused by the optimization policy. However, these &quot;research&quot; and &quot;evaluation&quot; have so far produced no results, and all the costs of the free green pass have been borne by the toll road operating companies. Without financial compensation, the toll station will naturally have to worry about every detail, trying to provide as little free service as possible and charge as much as possible. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to the green pass for agricultural products, there are many other toll-free policies, such as free passenger cars on holidays, which have also had a great impact on the income of highway companies. According to the statistical bulletin of the Ministry of Transport, 38.07 billion yuan in tolls for small passenger vehicles will be exempted during major holidays in 2021, which is more than 10 billion yuan more than the tolls exempted under the Green Pass for agricultural products. The total vehicle toll revenue from national toll roads that year was only 663.05 billion. Yuan, with these two reduction and exemption policies alone, the tolls collected are close to 10% of the total revenue. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The basic logic is who pays the bill. Nowadays, the policy is treating the guests, but it is the enterprises that foot the bill, and the promised compensation to the enterprises has yet to be received. Naturally, when companies pay bills, they have to make careful calculations and worry about every detail to avoid losses as much as possible. Therefore, the fundamental way to put an end to green-pass policy disputes is to straighten out the entire mechanism and fully compensate highway operation managers. With the popularization of electronic toll collection methods such as ETC, these are no longer technically difficult. We can also explore more ways to reduce logistics costs, such as directly issuing freight subsidies to transporters or wholesalers of fresh agricultural products, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 22 Oct 2023 13:25:08 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[出门旅游住急诊省钱？怎么把“假病人”送出医院？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259041]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-22 12:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https:// feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange &quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 22 Oct 2023 12:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[丈夫跳槽后，一位44岁大学女老师的“不情愿辞职”]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259067]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-22 11:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/22/96CwRqxG7lxy2ftciXbg9N6ki1OyoPwI0rhTGySK.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;954&quot; height=&quot;874&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/22/96CwRqxG7lxy2ftciXbg9N6ki1OyoP wI0rhTGySK. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254821&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>; (Nongjian/Picture) &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Just after Teachers&#39; Day in 2023, a former female university teacher told social media about her experience of being &quot;tied and resigned&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the narration, Yao Xue (pseudonym), the former associate professor of the Academy of Fine Arts of Linyi University, encountered a difficult choice in his 17th year of work. My husband, who works at the same college, received a job opportunity from a 985 university, but the &quot;release&quot; conditions issued by the school&#39;s human resources office were that the husband&#39;s transfer must be approved and the wife must voluntarily resign. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yao Xue said that this request shattered her more than ten years of hard work. &quot;In their eyes, if I have any value, why don&#39;t they care?&quot; In the end, she chose to fulfill her husband. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On July 19, 2022, she signed the dismissal letter and changed from a university associate professor to an unemployed wife. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yao Xue provided documents such as recordings of conversations with relevant persons in charge of the school and college, social media communication records, and letters of dismissal as proof. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Behind the case is a road that is not smooth for the mobility of teachers in Chinese universities. In order to retain teachers, universities often refuse them on the grounds that the service period has not expired, graduate guidance and project work have not been completed, or they file claims for high liquidated damages. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu Jin, a doctoral supervisor at the School of Humanities and Social Sciences at Beijing Institute of Technology, has been studying the phenomenon of university teacher mobility for many years. He found that in the West, it is normal for university teachers to &quot;change jobs&quot;, but in Asia it has become more serious. Specific to East Asia, the mobility ratio of university teachers in China is lower than that in Japan and South Korea. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Resigned unwillingly&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Yao Xue, 44 years old, on September 11, 2023, she posted on her personal WeChat account that had been suspended for a year and a half. She published a long article on her blog, describing the heart-wrenching Teacher&#39;s Day she had just experienced: Her former students sent blessings on Teacher&#39;s Day as they did in previous years, but she was unable to tell the story of what happened during last summer vacation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The story begins in 2005. Yao Xue and Yang Mu both graduated from a normal university with master&#39;s degrees and joined Linyi Normal University (now Linyi University). After that, they got married and had children. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yang Mu later studied for an on-the-job doctorate and published nearly forty papers and three monographs in 17 years, developing upwards. In 2021, Yang Mu received a job opportunity from a 985 university. In the same year, Yao Xue was finally promoted to associate professor. Different from her husband&#39;s development trajectory, she has taught at least 16 professional courses from sketching plaster statues, oil painting landscapes to basic design, and also opened a general aesthetic education course for all students in the school. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The career development of both of them will change in 2021, and their lives seem to be going to the next level. Yao Xue plans to stay in Linyi if her husband goes to work in another city. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But from the time they received the job offer to Linyi University’s final release, the couple struggled with the school for half a year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Obtaining a transfer letter from a 985 university is only the first step. Inter-school transfers of university teachers must obtain the consent of their department or college, and then report to the personnel department for approval. In the case of professors, the transfer process usually needs to be discussed and approved by the school party committee before the transfer process can be initiated. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Academy of Fine Arts first rejected Yang Mu’s transfer request. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There were not many opportunities to discuss transfer applications at the meeting. After missing it at the end of 2021, Yang Mu spent half a year in constant communication, hoping to seize the meeting in mid-2022. Just a week before the meeting, the party secretary of the college, who had already relented, conveyed the opinion of the Human Resources Department to Yang Mu: You want to be transferred and your wife wants to resign. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yao Xue said that she was &quot;stunned&quot; at that time and she tried to prove to the school that &quot;she was valuable.&quot; During her teaching career, her oil paintings won nearly ten competition awards and exhibition opportunities. &quot;If the school wants to eliminate old teachers, it will never pass on people like me through normal assessment.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yao Xue originally thought that the school felt that her husband’s transfer would affect her work. She sent a text message to the director of the Human Resources Department to express her attitude: “As a teacher at Linhua University, I have my own professional ethics and career pursuits. Since then, I have worked diligently in teaching and scientific research and have never slackened off.&quot; He also emphasized that whether Yang Mu stays or goes, it will not affect her working status. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The other party’s reply was to ask Yao Xue and his wife to “understand the school’s desire for talents and the demand for talents in the construction of first-level disciplines and majors.” Moreover, the school also has rules and regulations for the normal flow of talents. “We need to Follow the prescribed procedures.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In a recording provided by Yao Xue, the other party said that the school has the social responsibility to maintain family harmony and stability, and &quot;does not encourage, do not advocate, and in principle do not engage in separation between the two places.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Service period, scientific research completion and high compensation&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;What obstacles may a university teacher encounter if he wants to be transferred? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After talking to several teachers who have experienced the &quot;difficulty of changing jobs&quot;, Zhang Duanhong, associate professor at the Institute of Higher Education of Tongji University, learned about a &quot;chain&quot;: the principal, the vice president in charge of human resources, the director of the personnel department, the dean, Secretary, everyone on this line must pay close attention and communicate frequently. A teacher interviewed told Zhang Duanhong: &quot;You must not seek for speed, you must significantly reduce your time expectations.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhang Duanhong analyzed that in communicating with different departments, teachers have to go back and forth and complete their own teaching work. In the end, Physically and mentally exhausted, the mobilization matter fell into place. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to the difficulty in successfully completing the transfer procedures, teachers have to &quot;change jobs&quot; and the costs they bear include returning the allocated housing and facing huge claims for compensation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Unlike Yao Xue&#39;s forbearance, Southern Weekend reporters checked the referee documents website and found that some teachers hope to use the law to get rid of their original units. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ma, a former professor at Yangzhou University Law School, sued the school in 2020 because he wanted to be transferred to Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, but Yangzhou University would not let him go. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The relevant judgment shows that Ma mentioned that in April 2020, the registration deadline set by the new unit was approaching, but Yangzhou University Law School refused to sign and release him on the grounds of &quot;college development&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ma was introduced to Yangzhou University in November 2011 and has served for eight years. Yangzhou University argued that his service period had not ended - Ma signed agreements in 2013 and 2019 when he obtained the qualifications for higher-level professional and technical positions and the fourth-level professional and technical positions, corresponding to 8 years and 3 years respectively. During the working period, one must &quot;perform the service period honestly and trustworthy&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Scientific research and projects are another means of &quot;stuck&quot; people. In a ruling issued by the Anning District Court of Lanzhou City, Gansu University of Political Science and Law disagreed with the departure of a teacher because the graduate students he supervised had not yet graduated and his own scientific research project had not yet been completed. The school believes that his resignation will &quot;seriously affect the completion of the ongoing research project&quot; and that failure to complete the project on time &quot;will inevitably affect Gansu University of Political Science and Law&#39;s future project application work.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some teachers are required to pay a considerable amount of compensation when they leave their original school. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;China Science News&quot; once reported that in 2013, after Hu, a teacher at Nanchang Institute of Technology, obtained a doctorate on the job, he signed a new agreement with the school to continue teaching at Nanchang Institute of Technology until June 2019. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the expiration of the service period, Hu applied for resignation and transfer. However, Nanchang Institute of Technology formulated the &quot;Interim Regulations on Personnel Deployment (Revised)&quot; in 2018, which stipulates that teachers at the school need to extend their employment for 5 years after being awarded the title of professor. Annual service period. Hu was promoted to professor in 2016. When he resigned, he still had 2 years and 2 months of unfinished service. He had to pay compensation, which was calculated based on &quot;the average annual pre-tax income in the past three years multiplied by the unfinished service period.&quot; , totaling nearly 440,000 yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is also a situation where university teachers study for a Ph.D. while on the job, and after graduation &quot;look for another job&quot;, but are blocked by their original school. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporters searched the Judgment Documents Network and found that Linyi University had sued Xue Li, a teacher at the school&#39;s law school, demanding liquidated damages of 300,000 yuan and other expenses. In 2016, Xue Li went to Heilongjiang University to study for a Ph.D., and Linyi University signed a &quot;Non-directional Doctoral Training Contract&quot; with her. According to the contract, Xue Li will be responsible for all expenses during her studies. The school will pay her salary in the form of a loan. After Xue Li obtains her doctorate, she must report back to Linyi University on time. If she is transferred during the service period, the borrowed salary and reimbursement will be borne by her. After the funds are written off according to the actual number of months of service, the balance will be returned to the school in full, and a penalty of 300,000 yuan will be paid. After Xue Li graduated, she joined Anyang Normal University. Linyi University then demanded that Xue Li return the &quot;borrowed wages&quot; and pay liquidated damages. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for the &quot;couple bundling&quot; method of retaining people, Yang Mu and Yao Xue were indeed caught off guard. Southern Weekend reporters interviewed several scholars who study the mobility of university teachers, and they also said they had heard of it for the first time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But there is one exception. Liu Jin added that if the school provides a job for the spouse of a college teacher when the teacher is introduced, then whether the spouse’s job will be retained after the employee leaves the job must be based on the written agreement at the time of talent introduction. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to ensure that the introduced talents have no worries, colleges and universities usually &quot;assist&quot; their spouses in solving their problems. The intensity of &quot;assistance&quot; depends on the talent&#39;s own ability level and the spouse&#39;s own academic qualifications. Southern Weekend reporters noticed that Huangshan University’s 2023 talent introduction plan mentioned that “if high-level talents leave, their spouses must leave at the same time.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yao Xue said that she was unmarried when she joined the company as a master&#39;s student in 2005 and lived in a single dormitory, which did not fall into the category of &quot;disposed of work.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhang Duanhong found that teachers rarely resolve obstacles encountered during transfer through judicial channels. The main reason is that they are afraid of breaking up with their original units and leaving a bad reputation. However, according to a review of the judgment documents website, it can be found that the court usually fully considers the position of university teachers. In the aforementioned lawsuits related to Yangzhou University and Gansu University of Political Science and Law, the court ruled that the teacher should terminate the personnel contract relationship with the original school. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Xue Li&#39;s case, the court held that Xue Li assumed the responsibility of a university teacher and the salary she received was labor remuneration, and Xue Li&#39;s admission to the &quot;non-directed training doctorate&quot; meant that her future workplace was uncertain. , a two-way choice will be implemented after graduation. Therefore, Xue Li only needs to refund the social insurance and provident fund paid by Linyi University after joining Anyang Normal University. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Brain drain, the dilemma of colleges and universities&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Why are colleges and universities &quot;stuck&quot; at all levels? This is closely related to the development difficulties and teacher shortages that schools will face after the brain drain. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Universities in the central and western regions were once the areas hardest hit by the loss of teachers. In March 2020, Zhao Xudong, then director of the Teacher Affairs Department of the Party Committee of Lanzhou University of Technology, revealed to the media: According to incomplete statistics, 49 universities in Gansu Province lost 2,600 talents from 2012 to 2017, which is about one-third of the number of introduced talents. one. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, Liu Jin found that in the past 10 years, there has been an &quot;inflection point&quot; in the mobility of teachers in eastern and western universities: the participation of teachers in western universities has greatly reduced, and has been replaced by local or international teacher mobility in eastern universities. In recent years, this trend has become more obvious. Liu Jin analyzed that perhaps eastern universities prefer star scholars with academic competitiveness and reputation, while the brain drain of western universities has reached a plateau. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Similar to Yang Mu, the core logic of teacher mobility in colleges and universities today is &quot;people go to higher places.&quot; In &quot;double-non&quot; colleges and universities, teachers have a strong desire to move. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu Jin found that income is not the most important factor affecting the mobility of college teachers. Their pursuit of academic prestige sometimes makes up for the lack of income. Choosing a higher-ranked school is exactly the way to improve academic prestige. way. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At Linyi University, the dilemma of brain drain is equally real and needs to be solved urgently. The school’s “14th Five-Year Plan” mentioned that “there is still a shortage of leading academic talents, young academic talents and high-level innovative teams, and the brain drain in some disciplines is serious.” In 2019, Li Yingkui, then deputy director of the Personnel Office of Linyi University, wrote an analysis that the school had no advantages in terms of schooling level and geography, and had long lacked sufficient funds to introduce high-end talents. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A teacher who taught at the school from 2017 to 2021 revealed that many teachers with doctoral degrees resigned at the school. The teacher said that he was required to hand in his doctoral diploma when he joined the job. and original degree certificate. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The school had more realistic considerations in the transfer of Yang Mu and his wife. According to Yao Xue, the director of the Human Resources Department once mentioned to Yang Mu, &quot;I heard that I will apply for a master&#39;s degree next year. If you leave, it will be ruined.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The official website of the Academy of Fine Arts of Linyi University shows that the academy held a promotion meeting for the construction of professional master&#39;s degree programs in April 2021. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This puzzled Yao Xue. She explained that what the college applied for this time was a professional master&#39;s degree, not an academic master&#39;s degree. Yang Mu&#39;s achievements were all theoretical articles, and it was useless to apply for a professional master&#39;s degree. &quot;On the contrary, I, as a member of the tutor team applying for the master&#39;s degree, was the only one under 45 years old. As an associate professor and technical teacher, my results are useful.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In a document issued by the National Art Professional Degree Graduate Education Steering Committee, Southern Weekend reporters noted that the Education Steering Committee’s guidance on professional degree The requirement for direction instructors is that they “must have educational background and practical experience in the major they are guiding.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Zhang Duanhong’s view, making it more difficult for colleges and universities to “change jobs” is not necessarily to keep anyone, but more “to slow down the flow of talent and balance it with the speed of recruitment.” He pointed out that if universities really want to retain students, they should create better working conditions for teachers. If teachers are allowed to &quot;leave with love,&quot; they will try their best to give back to the school in the future. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu Jin encountered examples of &quot;peaceful breakup&quot; in his research. After a teacher &quot;changed jobs&quot;, the doctoral students and postdocs he taught at the original school still studied with him. This teacher also regularly goes to the original school to participate in academic activities and secures many resources for the school. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Why is free academic mobility a good thing? After reviewing the history of European medieval universities, Liu Jin found that the difficulty in mobility of graduates from low-prestige universities had attracted the attention of the authorities and promoted the establishment of teacher licensing and degree-granting normative systems, while academic mobility was mostly based on prototype universities. Derivative universities are mainly based on outward transportation and radiation, and are built through mobility. Since most academic career subjects come from prototype universities, it also drives the transmission of academic career norms, thereby maintaining a high level of standardization in the entire industry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporters contacted the director of the Human Resources Department of Linyi University, hoping to learn about the other party&#39;s request for Yao Xue to resign. The other party said that he would contact the school&#39;s Propaganda Department. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As of press time, the Propaganda Department of Linyi University had not responded to interview requests. During the call, a staff member expressed that he did not want to create more pressure on Teacher (Yao Xue). &quot;We are protecting the teacher (attitude). Although she has resigned now, she is still our alumnus.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;The &quot;tied&quot; spouse&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Yao Xue does not want the focus of the incident to be shifted to the couple, let alone Wanting to be considered a &quot;hostage of her husband.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the incident was posted on the Internet, she responded to almost every question raised by netizens. One of them is: &quot;You don&#39;t need to look to know that his wife is a buy one, get one free.&quot; &quot;Buy one, get one free&quot; refers to the aforementioned situation of introducing talents to solve the spouse&#39;s work. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yao Xue commented: They do not believe that a female teacher has independent value and dignity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In her narration, she had a rich and enviable life: after graduating from her undergraduate degree, she was recommended to become the first batch of master&#39;s students at her alma mater; in the past 17 years, her teaching quality evaluation has been excellent 13 times; she could have gone to Zhejiang, Guangdong and other more economically developed regions. But when she applied for Linyi University, the old secretary of the Fine Arts Department received her. As soon as they met, he held her hand and said, &quot;Thank you for supporting the construction of our old district.&quot; This immediately aroused her sense of responsibility. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yao Xue’s life before resigning could indeed be called “quiet years.” Most of her Weibo is filled with cats, school, and the growth of her children. She also worries about the difficulty of publishing papers and applying for projects as a teacher at a local college, so much so that she prays for success in her projects and papers during some holidays. . When her husband, who has written a lot of books, calls her a scientific expert, she will laugh at herself as a &quot;scientific researcher&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Amid the &quot;difficulty in mobility&quot; of university teachers, the situation of female teachers may be even more complicated. In a study on gender differences in teacher mobility at research universities that Liu Jin participated in, the mobility frequency of female teachers at 11 universities including Peking University was significantly lower than that of men. One of the reasons is that female scholars are very worried about being treated differently in terms of income and other aspects during the migration process. A study by a foreign scholar mentioned that female university teachers will lose 8% of their income when they change jobs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yang Hui, executive deputy director of the Gender Equality Research Center of Yangzhou University, found that gender differential treatment in colleges and universities is not obvious, but it will become apparent at critical moments related to career advancement. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After analyzing the performance of male and female teachers at Yangzhou University in terms of scientific research results, professional titles, etc., Yang Hui proposed that teachers’ professional achievements have become gender stratified. For example, women are less common among high-end scientific research groups and high-level administrative managers. . In a 2022 article, Bai Ling, a lecturer at the School of Educational Sciences at Bohai University, studied the teaching staff of a local university and found that male teachers published more papers in Journal C (referring to journals included in the &quot;Chinese Social Sciences Citation Index&quot;) than Female teachers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Yang Hui’s view, once a woman is constrained in childbearing and parenting in a dual-career family that is originally synchronized, the career achievement gap will easily be widened by her partner. In a conversation with the person in charge of the Human Resources Department, Yao Xue learned that there was a teacher couple in a certain college of the school who were in a similar situation at the same time. My husband was going to be transferred to a university in Shanghai, but “my family members refused to leave, and now they have also resigned together.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to Yao Xue, the wife graduated from Peking University with a master&#39;s and doctoral degree. On the day when Yang Mu went to school to stamp the last chapter on his resignation procedures, he met the husband who had applied for transfer. The other party told him that his wife had joined the school a year earlier than him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporters tried to contact the couple, but the male teacher refused to be interviewed. He said that his wife was not &quot;blackmailed&quot; when she resigned. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another netizen left a message: &quot;What I don&#39;t understand is why in both couples, the husband was promoted and the wife was &#39;resigned&#39;. Is it a coincidence or is it really more difficult for women to be promoted and transferred?&quot; Yao Xue admitted: &quot;It may be both. The situation between the two of us is indeed because my spouse&#39;s scientific research ability is much better than mine.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For Yao Xue, 44 is an embarrassing age. . When she graduated in 2005, there were still very few master&#39;s degrees in art, and a large number of colleges and universities offered favorable conditions to recruit students. But now the situation has changed. Colleges and universities generally recruit teachers with a Ph.D. degree. As for vocational schools that value practicality, they prefer teachers majoring in design, film and television, and animation. The demand for teachers majoring in oil painting is very limited. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After being unemployed for more than a year, she has not given up on seeking a teaching position. She has received 3 interview opportunities, but no follow-up. She began to take orders for customized oil paintings of pets and portraits as a side job. Although she could not support herself through this, she could find some value in it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She still wants to return to the podium, especially when she receives blessings from students on Teacher&#39;s Day. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(Yao Xue and Yang Mu are pseudonyms at the request of the interviewees)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 22 Oct 2023 11:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[伸手要钱与不受干涉只能择其一：年轻人不能“既要又要”]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258937]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-22 10:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Every October is a long holiday, when boyfriends and girlfriends meet their parents, and couples hold weddings. These things are very intensive. There are a lot of good things, but also a lot of bloody plots. Due to differences in customs, conflicting concepts, and disagreements in language, small things often become big problems, causing lovers to quarrel or even break up on bad terms. After the holidays, such complaints can be seen everywhere on social platforms. Reading these words, it seems that you can gain a lot just by eating melon. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Recently, I saw such a hotly debated incident: a pair of newlyweds visited each other&#39;s elderly. First, the elderly in the woman&#39;s family gave the man a red envelope of 2,000 yuan. Then he visited the man&#39;s house, and the man&#39;s parents gave the woman 2,600 yuan, which was slightly more, and seemed fine. Unexpectedly, the woman&#39;s brother and sister-in-law were obstructing the situation. They thought the man&#39;s gift was too little and demanded that the gift be doubled in accordance with local customs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The man thinks it is unreasonable and the woman thinks there is no empathy and consideration. There was a quarrel, the boyfriend and girlfriend blamed each other, each was disappointed, and finally broke up. There are a lot of tragicomedies like this available on the Internet, and there are many more bloody ones than this one. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The first level of analysis is very simple, it depends on who is causing trouble for no reason or making trouble unreasonably. The woman&#39;s family must obviously bear the responsibility - the brother and sister-in-law are not parents, but they interfere in the sister&#39;s private affairs on the grounds of customs, which is really too lenient. They are suspected of being greedy for money and profit. If such character is not maintained, there will be trouble. Many people congratulate the man for this, saving him a lot of trouble in the future. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The second level of analysis: young people fall in love and get married, there are all kinds of frictions, and the deepest collision is values. Values ​​cannot be consistent, and all kinds of things wrapped up in romantic love and personality congeniality will melt away sooner or later. When a man and a woman are in love, especially when discussing marriage, both parties may wish to be more brave and show their personal values. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If the concept is the same, there will be resonance. The prospective couple or husband and wife will appreciate and respect each other, and the relationship will develop in depth. This is the basis for the lasting and harmonious family relationship. If you have different views, you might as well communicate more and seek to get closer to each other. If the differences are too big, they will break up at best, which is a good thing in the long run. Under this post, many people came to express their congratulations - it was a good break for the two people who had deep differences in their views. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In a new family, the husband and wife are of the same mind and can avoid internal divisions. How do they avoid external disturbances, especially interference from their parents and families? This is the third level of analysis that we will focus on next. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Chinese family life, from discussing marriage to getting married, buying a house, and having and raising children, the elders have a great say, but most of them are stubborn. This is a distress faced by many Chinese families. On the one hand, young couples are dissatisfied with their elders. They think they have old-fashioned ideas, weird ideas, lack of skills, are picky and complain, and interfere indiscriminately. On the other hand, the elders also criticize the younger generation a lot, thinking that they are rude, heartless, turn their elbows outward, extravagant and wasteful, lazy and arrogant, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We are used to seeing such conflicts: every time we enter a new stage of life, new points of family conflict will appear. It ranges from despising small quarrels to falling apart at worst. Many people think that once the house purchase bill is passed, everything will be solved. However, the conflicts have not disappeared. As money is collected to buy a house and the elderly take care of their children, family conflicts become more intense. In comparison, disputes over red envelopes before marriage are so trivial that they can be ignored. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To resolve it, it is actually very simple. A new family is financially independent from the moment it is formed. Don’t be greedy for betrothal gifts and dowry, and don’t put a burden on your parents and family. It sounds incredible, but in fact, most of our parents&#39; generation got married with nothing. At that time, the income was still low, and most people worked hard just to have food and clothing. The burden of distress on contemporary young people only became a phenomenon in recent decades. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is not terrible for young people to be temporarily poor. As long as the family is harmonious inside and outside, and they work hard to make money after marriage, they can still thrive without &quot;family wealth&quot;. On the contrary, some new families are well off and receive support from their elders, but this also involves many conflicts. Husband and wife quarrel, in-laws are at odds, and there is wastage both internally and externally. Many people only see the benefits of betrothal gifts and dowry, but fail to see that forcibly &quot;fighting&quot; for betrothal gifts is actually a huge disaster for marriage. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The family is financially independent and it is difficult for parents to interfere. They didn’t pay, they didn’t pay attention, they couldn’t speak up, and they didn’t have the confidence. If money is given, they must be concerned and have the urge to dominate. Brothers and sisters, as stakeholders, will inevitably speak out. The brother and sister-in-law in the &quot;Red Envelope Incident&quot; are ugly, but they have the right to speak - who told the old man in the family to pay 2,000 yuan as soon as they met, and there will be more later. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many people understand this truth, but they cannot do it. Under contemporary reality, buying a house requires financial assistance, getting married needs to be organized, and betrothal gifts serve as a start-up fund for a new home and must not be given up. Especially after having children, most couples rely on their parents for help and are far from financially independent. In this case, what should we do? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is no better way but to accept reality. Young people who are about to get married are already adults. They cannot ask for money while shouting for independence and rejecting the opinions of their parents. This is inconsistent with interpersonal ethics and goes against human nature. Not only do you want financial benefits, but you also need to be free from restraint. The price must be conflicts in family relationships and weakening of family relationships. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many young people do not realize this and point the source of conflicts at the wrongdoings of their elders. In terms of specific matters, some right and wrong analysis may be possible, but as long as the &quot;investment interests&quot; are not equal, conflicts will inevitably continue. It is unreasonable to enjoy both large transfer payments from parents and to be &quot;independent&quot;. To resolve this conflict, there are only two ways to go: achieve financial independence as soon as possible and compensate your elders for their financial contributions; or accept the reality and compromise with them. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This kind of compromise is not a shame, but a price to pay. On the contrary, those who exploit their parents&#39; wealth in the name of independence, take advantage of both sides and ignore their parents&#39; inner pain, are the ones who really deserve to be despised. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 22 Oct 2023 10:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[14万病例，2年PK，集采仿制药疗效和安全性怎么样？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259061]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-22 09:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/ image/23/10/21/a4c26c75fa.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/ 21/a4c26c75fa.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254816&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;For a true and comprehensive understanding of the safety and effectiveness of selected generic drugs in centralized procurement In response to the epidemic, the National Medical Insurance Administration organized medical institutions to conduct real-world research on the clinical efficacy and safety of the second and third batches of generic drugs selected for national mass procurement. Visual China/Picture&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;After two years of &quot;big PK&quot;, a study covering 29 medical institutions in 16 provinces across the country and about 140,000 real cases showed that &quot; The clinical efficacy and safety of generic drugs selected through centralized procurement are equivalent to those of original drugs.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Since 2018, 8 batches of state-organized drug procurement have been carried out across the country, involving 333 kinds of drugs, with a total use of more than 216 billion tablets/tubes. A large number of selected generic drugs have entered the clinical frontline, reducing the burden on patients and increasing the substitution rate of generic drugs. Hundreds of millions of patients have access to high-quality and affordable drugs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;There are also some medical staff and patients who still lack confidence in the clinical efficacy and safety of generic drugs, especially whether the quality of the selected generic drugs can be guaranteed after the price reduction. There are concerns, and some people have suggested that consistency evaluation does not equal clinical equivalence.&quot; On the morning of October 17, 2023, Zhang Lan, Director of the Pharmacy Department of Xuanwu Hospital of Capital Medical University (hereinafter referred to as Xuanwu Hospital), spoke at a press conference of the National Medical Insurance Administration Said above. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In order to truly and comprehensively understand the safety and effectiveness of generic drugs selected through centralized procurement, starting from 2021, the National Medical Insurance Administration will organize Xuanwu Hospital and other medical institutions to target the second , conducted real-world research on the clinical efficacy and safety of three batches of generic drugs selected for national mass procurement. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Previously, Xuanwu Hospital and more than 20 medical institutions in Beijing conducted real-world research on the 14 selected drugs in the first batch of centralized procurement, and the results showed that the selected drugs There is no statistical difference in clinical effectiveness and safety between generic drugs and original drugs (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;For details, please see Southern Weekend&#39;s report on November 7, 2021 &quot;&lt; a href=&quot;http://www.infzm.com/content/217325&quot;>;100 million people benefited, and the three-year medical insurance negotiation burden was reduced by nearly 170 billion yuan&lt;/a>;》&lt;/span>;). &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Zhang Lan is the leader of the research team for this 140,000 real case study. It is reported that the research and evaluation targets 23 varieties in six major therapeutic areas including anti-infection, anti-tumor, metabolism and endocrinology, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular, neuropsychiatric, and digestive systems, including selected generic drugs from 38 brands. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Zhang Lan revealed that in the future, we will continue to conduct real-world evaluations of subsequent batches of selected generic drugs to provide evidence-based support for clinical use. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;There is no statistical difference in clinical efficacy and safety&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Real-world research reflects the actual diagnosis and treatment process and changes in patients&#39; health conditions under real conditions. More objectively evaluate the safety and effectiveness of medication in real environments.&quot; Bian Xiaolan, Director of the Pharmacy Department of Ruijin Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University, introduced. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The results of this study show that five oral anti-infective drugs, including cefdinir, cefaclor, azithromycin, linezolid and moxifloxacin, are similar to There is no statistical difference in clinical efficacy and safety between pharmaceutical and original drugs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Among the anti-tumor drugs, five generic drugs: Tegio, azacitidine, abiraterone, letrozole, and anastrozole, are comparable to the original drugs The clinical efficacy and safety are equivalent. The therapeutic response rate of generic capecitabine is higher than that of the original drug (50% vs 30%), and the difference is statistically significant. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Among the drugs for metabolic diseases, metformin (hypoglycemic drug), vildagliptin (hypoglycemic drug), and febuxostat (uric acid-lowering drug) are the best choices There is no statistical difference in clinical efficacy and safety between generic drugs and original drugs. There are 4 brands of generic drugs of glimepiride (hypoglycemic drugs) participating in the evaluation. Among them, the efficacy and safety of 3 brands of generic drugs are equivalent to the original drugs. Another brand of generic drugs is not only safe. It is equivalent to the original drug, and in the evaluation index of hypoglycemic effect, the compliance rate of glycosylated hemoglobin &lt;7% is higher than that of the original drug (61.7% vs 42%). &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;A total of 3 types of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular drugs were included in the evaluation, including 2 anticoagulants (apixaban, ticagrelor) and 1 antihypertensive drug medicine (valsartan). The results showed that there was no statistical difference in clinical efficacy and safety between the generic drugs of the above three drugs and the original drugs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;There are also 2 psychotropic drugs and 1 digestive system treatment drug. There is no statistical difference in clinical efficacy and safety between the generic drug group and the original drug. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The target population of real-world evaluation is patients who actually use clinical drugs. The sample size can reach hundreds to tens of thousands. The research indicators are direct efficacy and safety. Clinical indicators, study duration, long-term follow-up of subjects as needed. Compared with real-world studies, drug consistency evaluation focuses on verifying the equivalence of generic drugs to original drugs in terms of design, biological absorption and metabolism, and the target population is healthy subjects. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Research indicators mainly include pharmaceutical equivalence and bioequivalence. Only when pharmaceutical equivalence and bioequivalence are met can generic drugs Through consistency evaluation.&quot; Bian Xiaolan explained. Pharmaceutical equivalence requires that generic drugs have the same active ingredients, effective dosage, route of administration, dosage form, etc. as the original drug, and must meet drug quality standards. Bioequivalence requires that the absorption and metabolism of generic drug preparations in the body are consistent with those of the original drug. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;We conduct real-world research to further verify and support the efficacy of drugs through different scenarios and methods. It is a process in which real-world data generates real-world evidence. It’s not that the quality and efficacy consistency evaluation work standards are not high.” Bian Xiaolan emphasized that through real-world research, the research team has verified the efficacy and safety of the drugs selected through centralized procurement through the generic drug consistency evaluation from actual diagnosis and treatment scenarios. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Six drugs have been notified of centralized procurement in the past five years&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Passing the consistency evaluation is not a &quot;talisman&quot; or &quot;pass&quot; for drug quality. After a drug passes the consistency evaluation, the regulatory authorities will still conduct full-chain quality supervision on the production, circulation, and use of the drug. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Drug supervision is not only the supervision of results, but also the supervision of the process. For example, the regulatory authorities require: ensure that the production process is consistent with the approved process, and ensure that each batch of sales The quality of sub-standard drugs is consistent with the declared samples to ensure continuous research on marketed drugs and timely reporting of adverse reactions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;For example, in the production process, from the selection of raw materials to the production process, there is a complete quality control and supervision system, even if it is only the supplier of pharmaceutical raw materials. Replacements need to be reported to the drug regulatory department to ensure the stability of drug quality.&quot; Zhang Lan gave an example. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;At the same time, the national drug administration and medical insurance departments have established a quality supervision coordination mechanism for the selected products, and implemented full-coverage supervision and inspection of the selected companies. The State Food and Drug Administration deploys special supervision work every year to achieve &quot;three full coverages&quot; of enterprise supervision and inspection of selected products through national centralized procurement, product sampling inspection, and adverse drug reaction monitoring. Currently, inspections involve nearly 600 drug manufacturers, covering all 333 selected drugs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;A total of 1,387 selected products were selected in eight batches of national-organized centralized procurement. In the past five years, a total of 6 products have been notified by the drug regulatory authorities as having quality risks, including 2 domestically produced imitation products. Pharmaceuticals, 4 imported drugs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;For the above-mentioned selected products that have quality risks, the medical insurance department will cooperate with the drug regulatory department to deal with them, including disqualification of the selected products, inclusion in the &#39;violation list&#39;, and restrictions on the products involved. Enterprises must participate in centralized procurement organized by the state within a certain period of time. For products with quality risks, regardless of domestic or foreign-funded enterprises, the medical insurance department will work with the drug regulatory department to deal with them resolutely, treat them equally, and continue to send the signal of &#39;zero tolerance&#39; for quality problems.&quot; National Medical Insurance Zhang Ming, leader of the bureau’s price recruitment expert group, introduced. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On October 13, as the Joint Procurement Office of National Organizations Drugs issued an announcement on its official website, the ninth batch of centralized procurement of nationally organized drugs also pressed the start button. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 22 Oct 2023 09:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[浪里人生丨记者手记]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259027]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-22 08:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/11/3KlQURn8IAiq75Cy8HWajQ9l7ECu7pLrtLJOg8Ig.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/3KlQURn8IAiq75Cy8HWajQ9l7ECu7pL rtLJOg8Ig. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253648&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On September 23, 2023, at Qingdao Olympic Sailing Center, Xu Jingkun sailed a sailboat out to sea&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern People Weekly reporter Liang Chen/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Details of relevant reports See &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.infzm.com/content/258546&quot;>;One-armed captain Xu Jingkun and his super racing boat丨cover character&lt;/a>;&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;October 2023 When Xu Jingkun sailed the boat to the &quot;Coffee Road&quot; racing village on the 14th, I was packing the wardrobe at home. Autumn has entered in the north, and it is said that there will be rain and the temperature will be lower next week. The life of ordinary people is like this, with three meals and four seasons, coming over and over again. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This year marks the 30th anniversary of the &quot;Coffee Road&quot; two-man non-stop transatlantic sailing race, and for the first time a single-man return race has been added. Xu Jingkun will first set off from France with his partner, British captain Mike Godin, around the west side of Africa and the northeastern side of South America to reach Central America, and then return to Europe alone. In just over a month, it crossed the equatorial windless zone twice and sailed more than 10,000 nautical miles (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 毷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;nearly 20,000 kilometers&lt;/span>;). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Looking at the video Xu Jingkun posted at sea, it was also very cold in France, and he also put on a thick windproof jacket on the boat. I remembered that during the interview he complained more than once that &quot;the water in France is so cold&quot; and &quot;the water in the Atlantic Ocean is too cold!&quot; I couldn&#39;t help but laugh. The cold and the warm are intertwined, but after all, heroes are very different from us ordinary people. I was busy looking for Wearing a sweater and long trousers, he can overcome the limitations of his body, join the wind and waves, and travel through the seasons. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When I met him in Qingdao in September, he had just flown back from France the day before. I asked him if he had jet lag, and he said no. &quot;My body is used to it!&quot; Years of ocean sailing have made him accustomed to it. It’s not just the time difference, it’s also the change of seasons. In 2024, he will participate in the world&#39;s most difficult &quot;Vendée Globe&quot; sailing race, and will experience nine winters and summers on the route. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the autumn of 2021, Xu Jingkun decided to buy an imoca60 super racing boat to participate in the 2024 Vendée Single Non-Stop Round the World Yacht Race. The four-year Vendée Globe is the &quot;Everest&quot; of competitive sailing. To win a ticket to the 2024 Vendée Globe, he must first participate in the designated qualifying event. In the 2022 season, he completed the &quot;Rum Road&quot; single-handed transatlantic sailing race, gained valuable points in the Vendée Globe qualifying event, and became one of the first official candidates for the 10th Vendée Globe in 2024. If the &quot;Coffee Road&quot; and the subsequent solo return race can be successfully completed, Xu Jingkun is expected to seize the ticket to the 2024 Vendée Globe. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When Xu Jingkun was 12 years old, his left forearm was amputated in an accident. He was nicknamed the &quot;one-armed captain&quot;. He controlled the sailboat with one hand and completed the circumnavigation of the China Sea in a single-handed boat. transatlantic, and circumnavigation, among other feats. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2015, Xu Jingkun began to participate in professional boat racing. There is no preferential treatment for the disabled in this field. All participants are &quot;capable&quot; in sailing competition - won the 2020 &quot;Vendée Globe&quot; The seventh-placed captain, Damian Seguin, finished the race wearing a pirate uniform, with a pirate hook in his raised left hand. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From the first moment I saw Xu Jingkun, his ease and ease made me forget that his residual arm was a problem. He said that sailing has completely changed him and turned him into a more and more comfortable person. I think what really healed him was his &quot;completeness&quot;. He has completely overcome the physical and mental damage caused by the accident. His Although his left hand is incomplete, years of training have given him and inspired him with super physical abilities, allowing him to do his job, control his life, achieve his goals, and walk steadily on the water. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It will take Xu Jingkun two days to drive the race boat from the port to the famous French port of Le Havre. Starting from October 20, the &quot;Coffee Road&quot; Double Transatlantic Race Village in Le Havre It will be open to the public, and the boats will set sail on the 29th to begin the 2023 transatlantic racing voyage. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Offshore sailing is a magical sport. On the one hand, the racing teams and captains have to withstand the pressure of budget and speed. On the other hand, even the fastest transatlantic record takes seven or eight days. , and the round-the-world voyage lasts for several months. Sailors in the deep sea will always feel a kind of loneliness that lasts for a long time and the sun and the moon are endless. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When I wrote this short article, Xu Jingkun had just posted a circle of friends.

On October 18, 2023, the family of Hanhan, a girl bitten by a Rottweiler in Chongzhou, Sichuan After initiating a personal request for help on the EasyCho platform, he got into a dispute over the donation amount and the use of the funds. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The mutual aid link shows that more than 87,000 people donated to Hanhan. The total amount of donations exceeded 2 million yuan in less than a day, reaching the goal of helping. On the afternoon of the 19th, some people began to withdraw their donations. As of 18:00 on October 20, the total amount dropped to 1.9996 million yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;249 people testified about Hanhan’s family’s situation in this help link with their real names. The witnesses claimed to be neighbors, relatives, parents&#39; friends, classmates or colleagues. Most of the messages proved that Hanhan was injured and needed rescue. However, some voices suggested that the Rottweiler owner and the property owner were willing to pay compensation. , is public fundraising of up to NT$2 million necessary? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to easily raising donations, Li Ping (pseudonym), the owner of the building involved, told Southern Weekend reporters that starting from the afternoon of the 17th, residents started to make spontaneous donations and statistics in the WeChat group for vegetable sellers in the community. And the donation was transferred to the girl&#39;s mother, Ms. Deng, &quot;one or two hundred yuan per person.&quot; Later, someone asked in the group about the whereabouts and use of the donation, but Ms. Deng did not respond directly to the inquiry except forwarding the easy fundraising help link, Douyin video, and thank-you reply in the group. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the afternoon of October 20, staff from the Publicity Department of West China Hospital told Southern Weekend reporters that the child is still in the intensive care unit and is being treated by multidisciplinary experts. His condition is &quot;much better than when he was admitted to the hospital.&quot; Smoother.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When a single request for help exceeds 500,000 yuan, EasyCho stipulates that &quot;a written certificate from a medical institution with relevant qualifications should be submitted.&quot; However, the above-mentioned hospital personnel said that the hospital &quot;did not issue any relevant expense certificates.&quot; The girl was transferred to the hospital at around 23:00 on the 16th. As of 8:00 on the 20th, the child had paid a total of 110,000 yuan in advance through the manual window. What had happened The cost is about 30,000 yuan, and there are currently no outstanding fees. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporters contacted the girl’s mother and case lawyer Zhou Zhaocheng many times, but as of press time, had not received any response from them. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 19, after raising 2 million yuan, this help link was closed. Qingsongchou told Southern Weekend reporters that this was shut down after the platform communicated with Ms. Deng and obtained the other party&#39;s consent. Hanhan&#39;s current expenses in the hospital were advanced by the property management, and neighbors around her also made donations. The nearly 2 million yuan in aid &quot;repaid Not moving”. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the controversy, it was reported on the Internet that in addition to raising money easily, the Hanhan family also raised millions of dollars on the Shuidichi platform. On October 19, Shuidichou’s public relations staff confirmed to Southern Weekend reporters that Hanhan’s family had not set up a help link on Shuidichou. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Neighbors donated money, property management fees were advanced&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;On the afternoon of October 20, Southern Weekend reporters came to the Evergrande Xichen Oasis Community involved. Many residents said that this property can only be considered &quot;medium&quot; in Chongzhou City (Chengdu City). The entire property is divided into three phases and there is no villa area. The second phase of the building where Hanhan&#39;s family lives is unfinished, and the houses will not be handed over until the end of 2022. There are still owners who have not taken over the property. Lianjia APP shows that the average transaction price of second-hand houses in this community in the past six months is 6,594 yuan/square meter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It was dinner time, and there were not many pedestrians. Some residents were walking with their Labrador dogs, and there were also children running and playing. If it weren&#39;t for the slogans about civilized dog-raising hanging up everywhere in the community, it would be difficult for outsiders to think of the tragedy of a Rottweiler biting a girl five days ago. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;The publicity board of the building where Hanhan&#39;s family lives.

The publicity board of the building has a leaflet of &quot;Be a Civilized Dog Keeper&quot;, as well as a recent notice from the property management to all owners: &quot;In view of civilized pet keeping management, the property management center now clearly implements the inspection requirements of all employees... Key reminders in the community are that if any unscrupulous dog owners are found, If a dog or stray animal is on a leash, the patrol post will catch it as soon as possible and send it away from the community.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A resident in the same unit recalled to a Southern Weekend reporter that on the morning of the incident, most parents On the way to take my children to school, &quot;there are very few people in the community.&quot; She is still afraid these days. If her son wants to go downstairs to play, she will subconsciously ask him to &quot;wait a moment.&quot; The resident said that he did not know Hanhan&#39;s family, and his community group did not organize donations, but these days everyone was intensely discussing the girl being bitten. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Luo Xia (pseudonym), another mother in the same unit, remembers that before her community group received the easy fundraising link sent by Ms. Deng, some neighbors spontaneously donated money in the group. Donations of varying amounts were forwarded by the group owner, and many people donated. Luo Xia saw someone donating 500 yuan, but she donated less than 100 yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The chat records provided by Li Ping show that the aforementioned vegetable sellers made three donations to Hanhan, namely 3566 yuan, 266 yuan, and 1416 yuan. On October 17, after the first two transactions were accepted, Ms. Deng replied &quot;Thank you.&quot; Li Ping said that these days, some residents who are not in the group also want to ask them to transfer donations, and some privately ask Ms. Deng’s WeChat account to donate to her. &quot;We are all parents, and we cannot bear to see our children suffer.&quot; Li Ping explained why she donated money. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;Screenshots of group donations provided by community residents.

Photo provided by the interviewee&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Luo Xia was thinking that the compensation would not be paid soon, so the neighbors first raised some money for Hanhan&#39;s family to deal with the emergency, &quot;Like us ordinary people, it is not easy to buy a house. You still have a mortgage, how much money can you have?&quot; Afterwards, she asked the group owner how much money they had raised in total. The group owner did not tell her the specific amount. Luo Xia estimated that if she gave it to the other party, &quot;it might be 20,000 to 30,000.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for the easy way to raise donations, attorney Zhou Zhaocheng said in an interview with the media on October 20 that the couple dressed simply, did not wear brand-name clothes or jewelry, and lived in an ordinary environment. The two of them are currently unemployed and devote themselves to taking care of their daughter in the hospital. They have no financial resources for the time being. Although follow-up rights protection will be launched one after another, as far as the child&#39;s treatment is concerned, the compensation payment is &quot;obviously too slow.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the same day, a reporter from Southern Weekend asked the housekeeper of the building as the owner. The other party said that the girl&#39;s treatment fee was currently paid by the property owner. &quot;After all, we will not be held responsible for what happened in the community.&quot; shirkable&quot;. The housekeeper said he did not know the specific amount of advance payment. Southern Weekend reporter learned from EasyCho that the current amount of advance payment from the property owner is around 100,000 yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;Family members estimate the amount themselves&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;As of October 20, Hanhan&#39;s family uploaded the West China Hospital&#39;s advance payment receipt, illness certificate, etc. in the easy mutual aid link. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the certificate of illness, in addition to multiple traumas caused by dog ​​bites, Hanhan also suffered from contusion and laceration of the right kidney, sepsis, embolism of the lower branch of the right renal artery, contusion of the liver, and fracture of the ribs. In addition, according to public information, Hanhan&#39;s family&#39;s annual income is between 30,000 and 100,000 yuan. They have a house, a car worth less than 100,000 yuan (not sold) and liabilities of more than 200,000 yuan. Hanhan does not have medical insurance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; EasyCho explained to Southern Weekend reporters that Hanhan’s fundraising project was initiated by her family on the 18th and passed the AI ​​review. After the link was widely forwarded and the amount of donations increased rapidly, the platform conducted a manual review. The review process required the fundraising staff to confirm the family&#39;s financial situation with Hanhan&#39;s family members and attorneys, and also communicate with the hospital, subdistrict office, and public security department. Verify authenticity from the side. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;(The girl) has no medical insurance or new rural cooperative medical insurance, and has not had time to buy it. The mother of the child seems to have just been working for a month and has no income. The father only earns several thousand yuan a month. We can’t afford it (the cost of ICU) at all,” explained a person involved in EasyCho. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;Fundraising content.

Network screenshot&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the self-discipline convention signed in August 2020 by Internet serious disease help platforms such as Qingshuanchou, Shuidichou, and Lovechou, if an individual’s single request for help exceeds 500,000 yuan, the sponsor should submit relevant documents. A written certificate from a qualified medical institution will be reviewed and published by the platform before the fundraising link is initiated. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Why did EasyChou open a help link for Hanhan with a target of 2 million yuan without obtaining relevant certificates? The public relations staff of EasyChou explained that considering that the child&#39;s condition was &quot;really very critical&quot; at the time, &quot;the family will communicate with the hospital.&quot; Afterwards, the family estimated such an amount, and we launched a (mutual aid fundraising link) for her.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The public relations officer also said that if the child uses this donation of nearly 2 million yuan for subsequent treatment, the platform will review the hospital&#39;s receipts and testing documents based on Hanhan&#39;s treatment. &quot;We will make a settlement at each stage, and then we will transfer the money to the hospital.&quot; He said that what can be guaranteed is that &quot;this money will definitely not reach the hands of the family.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If a user who donated money wants a refund, there is also a corresponding channel for Easy Raising. After the donor applies and provides relevant certificates, the previous funds can be returned via the original route. EasyCho stated that if the final expenditure is less than 2 million yuan, the money can be donated to other charity foundations. It will be decided by the family as to which charity foundation to donate to and which groups to help. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A former staff member who left EasyChou in 2021 analyzed to Southern Weekend reporters that the fundraising platform will also hope to gain higher visibility and better reputation through social public events, but Hanhan’s The fundraising link and fundraising speed are &quot;really too fast&quot;: &quot;We have helped many people before, spending more than one million yuan, but this is the first time we have encountered such serious cases of dog bites.&quot;&lt; /p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot; _blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best &lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 21 Oct 2023 22:55:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[柳大华实名举报棋协领导：有无操纵比赛胜负与奖金分配应彻查丨快评]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259037]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-21 22:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;On the evening of October 17, 2023, chess player Liu Dahua posted a video on his personal social media to &quot;report&quot; the country under his real name Guo Liping, deputy director of the Chess and Card Sports Management Center of the General Administration of Sport, has attracted public attention. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu Dahua accused Guo Liping, &quot;For a long time, she has protected and connived at the evil forces in the chess world, and openly used computer software and modern technological means to manipulate and arrange the outcome and prize distribution of various large-scale domestic competitions.&quot; And It was said that Guo Liping &quot;did not investigate this shocking scandal, but instead suppressed and retaliated in every possible way against the athletes and coaches who came forward to expose the scandal&quot; and demanded &quot;a thorough investigation and serious handling to return a clear and just sky to the Chinese chess community.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 18, the staff of the Chess and Card Sports Management Center stated that they had been informed of the matter and reported it to their leaders. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu Dahua did not produce any evidence in the &quot;report&quot;. How long is &quot;a long time&quot;? Who are the &quot;evil forces in the chess world&quot;? Which one is the “shocking scandal” referring to? Who did Guo Liping protect, condone, and retaliate against? What kind of games are &quot;manipulating the outcome of the game and arranging the distribution of prize money&quot;? Therefore, Liu Dahua should submit more concrete evidence to support the accusation, otherwise the &quot;scum&quot; and other statements are purely personal attacks, and the accusation is suspected of slander and defamation, and he should also bear corresponding legal liability. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for &quot;using computer software and modern technological means to manipulate the game&quot;, it is the focus of Liu Dahua&#39;s report video. The outside world also thinks based on this that this report may be related to this year&#39;s &quot;recording scandal&quot; in the chess world. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since Kasparov lost to &quot;Deep Blue&quot; in 1997, all chess sports have had to face the challenges of computer software and artificial intelligence. Compared with Go, which can only be played by deep learning AI, Chinese chess has been conquered by computer CPUs in the PC era at the beginning of this century. &quot;Being unable to play on a computer&quot; is not an issue in the Chinese chess community. &quot;Software cheating&quot; is a topic that has been discussed for many years. Once chess players use computer software, almost no one can beat the &quot;human-machine combination&quot; opponent. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The use of technological means to manipulate the outcome of games and arrange the distribution of bonuses mentioned by Liu Dahua is technically possible. If in the past, manipulation of the game required smoothing and management, today, if you want to determine the outcome by default, you only need to use technological means, such as hiding smart communication devices into the arena, and &quot;human-machine integration&quot; with the background in real time, so you will naturally be invincible. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For many years, it has become a common practice for Chinese chess players to accuse each other of &quot;software cheating&quot;. Even many new chess players will be suspected of using software to cheat just because their winning rate is too high, and this has even developed into mutual suspicion. , a point where everyone is in danger. Chess player Wang Tianyi has repeatedly encountered similar accusations, and even encountered a &quot;demonstration with a jammer&quot; by his opponent Zheng Weitong during a match. Therefore, as soon as Liu Dahua&#39;s report video came out, many chess enthusiasts believed that this incident was a follow-up to the &quot;recording scandal&quot; three months ago. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Recording Gate&quot; incident occurred in mid-July 2023. The recording content is mainly a conversation between chess players Wang Yuefei and Hao Jichao. The two of them mentioned &quot;buying and selling chess&quot; in slang, and also hinted that chess Hand Wang Tianyi &quot;instrument cheating&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the incident fermented, chess player Dang Fei expressed his position online, taking the attitude of &quot;demanding a thorough investigation&quot; and always &quot;connoting&quot; Wang Tianyi on social media. During this period, there were also episodes of &quot;Dang Fei issued a lawyer&#39;s letter&quot; and &quot;Wang Tianyi responded live on the air&quot;. The incident has not been resolved to this day. Dang Fei is Liu Dahua&#39;s disciple who broke into the house. On October 18, he also released a real-name report video, saying that he had 90 minutes of recordings and had forwarded the evidence to the relevant departments. It can be seen that the aftermath of the &quot;recording scandal&quot; is rippling, and this &quot;master-disciple report&quot; has escalated the controversy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Recording Gate&quot; has been fermenting for three months, from &quot;instrument cheating&quot; and &quot;buying and selling chess&quot; in the recording gate to Liu Dahua&#39;s accusation of &quot;computer software manipulating the game and arranging the outcome of the game.&quot; and bonus distribution.&quot; Whether these accusations are true or false accusations should be investigated by the Discipline Inspection and Supervision Department of the General Administration of Sports and even the public security organs, rather than remaining in a public opinion war. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This reporting incident is enough to make people reflect on the current positioning of the ancient sport of Chinese chess. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As early as 2005, the &quot;Zhao Xinxin buying incident&quot; made &quot;buying and selling chess&quot; a shadow hanging over the Chinese chess world. The &quot;recording scandal&quot; is not the first one this year. Audio and video evidence of &quot;chess player Zhao Guorong collecting money from students and leading people to compete in team competitions to win the title of master&quot; also made it to the Internet in August, and there has been no investigation conclusion yet. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;computer software&quot; mentioned in Liu Dahua&#39;s report cannot help but make people reflect. In view of the fact that &quot;buying, selling, winning and losing, accepting bribes for profit&quot; has become easier in the information age, then the value of winning and losing has nothing to do with competition. What is the significance of? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since the global optimal solution to Chinese chess has been conquered by computer computing power (just like the solution to the Rubik&#39;s Cube has long been conquered by human brain computing power), it might as well gradually evolve into a spontaneously developed intelligence among the people. For entertainment activities, competitions should be organized by private organizations, which should be responsible for their own profits and losses, and set their own rules, instead of being reduced to today&#39;s &quot;human-computer game&quot;, which wastes public funds and hurts the enthusiasm of chess fans. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;With the development of Chinese chess to this day, if it is really going to be reduced from &quot;a cultural treasure of the Chinese nation&quot; to a tool for &quot;trading wins and losses, taking bribes and making profits&quot;, then who is the murderer? Relevant departments should investigate this matter in depth and consider ways to reform the management of chess and card sports. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 21 Oct 2023 22:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[排队在各地“想你”系路牌打卡合影，这凭啥火的？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258625]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-21 21:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;When I saw it, it felt very similar to what I wanted to say in my heart.

In addition, City walks have emerged in various places, and young people have started walking in the city, taking photos while walking. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;These trips naturally bring traffic to scenic spots, Internet celebrity spots, streets and alleys, and this traffic is reflected on social platforms, that is, many people take photos of street signs. In other ways, the check-in goal of &quot;I have been here before&quot; was completed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;From a historical perspective, street signs are essentially one of the forms of plaques. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In terms of cultural origins, plaques are an indispensable decoration in Chinese classical architecture. Whether it is a building, a platform, a pavilion, a pavilion, a pavilion, a pavilion, a hall, or a pavilion, plaques are in harmony with the building. They are an essential part of the building and are equivalent to the eyes of the building. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Taking a plaque and showing the inscription on the plaque is the fastest way to convey that you have visited this place or like this place. In front of many historic sites, towers or mountain peaks, whether it is a stone tablet, a foyer plaque or a poem written in calligraphy, the public likes to take photos. This in itself is a self-evident awareness. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Although today&#39;s street signs have changed in form and text compared to inscriptions, they actually have the same expression effect and can achieve a &quot; The functions of &quot;I checked in here&quot; and &quot;Say this sentence for me&quot; are a modern &quot;mouth substitute&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Moreover, compared with the rigidity of plaques on ancient buildings, today’s street signs can be humorous and can also be customized with various golden sentences, making them more personalized and youthful in expression. , can better interact with the mood of young people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/HhTRsdQmapKYKUNw4xVmj1bOhwm7cdeOQKEFiyqy.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;810&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/HhTRsdQmapKYKUNw4xVmj1bOhwm7cdeOQKEFiyqy.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;254425&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（IC photo/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; >;&lt;strong>;Are street signs so popular that they annoy people? &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;It is worth noting that the large-scale imitation and transplantation of similar street signs in various places has also brought criticism to the popular street signs. Recently, the street signs installed by Zhejiang University, Central Academy of Fine Arts and other universities have been criticized by some freshmen. Some people said directly: &quot;I don&#39;t even want to take a look at the Internet celebrity aura that comes to my face.&quot; Others said euphemistically: &quot;It feels a bit out of class.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Moreover, as the number of Internet celebrity street signs continues to increase, the installation of street signs in some areas also has the problem of illegal construction. Since July this year, Shanghai, Ningbo, Shiyan, Leshan and other places have removed such illegal &quot;Internet celebrity street signs&quot; placed on the roadside. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Relevant staff from the Zoning and Place Names Office of Ningbo Municipal Civil Affairs Bureau of Zhejiang Province explained, &quot;Road name plates are a type of place name signs, which are national legal landmarks. It is also a kind of public facility and should be set up by the civil affairs department.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Captain He of the Comprehensive Law Enforcement Squadron of the Pujiang County Comprehensive Administrative Law Enforcement Bureau in Jinhua, Zhejiang Province said, &quot;These The size and shape are actually relatively close to, or basically the same as, the standard place name signs set up by the government’s civil affairs department. The Internet celebrity street signs we manage are mainly for those set up along the street, and are actually a type of place name sign. &lt;/ p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;It can be seen that if you just follow the trend without thinking and set up some Internet celebrity street signs in places such as universities and libraries, some of the styles do not match, and it may be wrong. Causing disgust. Secondly, if the road signs are installed by merchants themselves and named randomly, it is easy to mislead people to go the wrong way or find the wrong place, causing people to lose time and money. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In this regard, Professor Gu, associate professor at Southeast University School of Law and public member of the Nanjing Urban Governance Committee, analyzed, “Internet celebrity street signs that hinder public order require relevant departments to promptly Intervention and regulation. However, it is also the goal of urban management to explore more and better cultural and creative solutions and Internet celebrity designs that can attract traffic and bring economic benefits while taking into account social responsibilities.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In general, street signs that extend the traffic function can be viewed dialectically from multiple angles and optimize strategies. The presentation of street signs must, on the one hand, ensure the identification function of public facilities, and on the other hand, provide appropriate space for the presentation of &quot;Internet celebrity street signs&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;While diverting traffic without interfering with public travel, this may be the development direction of characteristic road signs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 21 Oct 2023 21:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[硬核军训是怎么炼成的]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258988]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-21 20:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/18/A72oqQdD8BybPWTNg0BalhXWNoO5Mh57DFsDOpHt.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;612&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/A72oqQdD8BybPWTNg0BalhXWNoO5Mh 57DFsDOpHt. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254443&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Guangxi Guilin University of Electronic Science and Technology 2023 freshmen military training demonstration&lt;span style=&quot;color: # aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Special Warfare Mode&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The alarm sounded, orange-red and white smoke staggered and dispersed, and the air was filled with sulfur smell. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;More than forty students wearing camouflage uniforms and holding model Type 95 rifles approached in batches from one side of the green field to the other. There are scattered fire rings made of cardboard boxes and obstacles covered with camouflage nets along the way. The advancers either suddenly fell down or rolled out of their guns to avoid the explosions flying from the opposite side. Every time he stopped neatly, he was still in the shooting posture, with the muzzle of the gun pointed at the &quot;enemy camp&quot; ahead. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this military training exercise, students acted as a special operations force of our country. Their mission at the moment is to board a strange border island to rescue the hostages held by terrorists. More than 20 people, including &quot;hostages&quot; and &quot;robbers,&quot; were stationed under a camouflage awning on the other side of the playground. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;While advancing, we encountered stubborn resistance from the enemy. Many special forces &quot;fell&quot; and 7 &quot;sacrificed&quot;. Medical soldiers wearing white armbands rushed into the smoke-filled battlefield in groups of four. The two in front held guns for cover, and the two behind carried the wounded onto stretchers for treatment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The robbers were equipped with more heavy firearms: a mortar and two rocket launchers. We only have one rocket launcher. When the battle was lost, the special forces issued a request for support. Subsequently, simulated armored vehicles and tanks manufactured at a 1:1 ratio were driven onto the playground one after another. With the support of solid barriers and mobile turrets, the special forces team successfully reached the enemy camp. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Rescue soldiers and tanks have surrounded the enemy camp layer by layer, but the robbers are still guarding the &quot;door&quot;. Our demolitions use directional blasts to blow up the stronghold. There was a loud noise and white light shot out. The hostages were finally rescued after rescue soldiers rushed in and engaged in close combat with the robbers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is the military training meeting of Guilin Institute of Aerospace Industry (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;hereinafter referred to as &quot;Guihang&quot;&lt;/span>;) on September 27 The finale of the parade ceremony: the performance of the special warfare phalanx. Long after the performance ended, the applause and cheers of more than 5,000 freshmen in military training echoed throughout the playground. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The flame of excitement burned in Instructor Zhang. As the instructor of the special operations phalanx and the planner of the special operations performance, he also participated in the &quot;rescue operation&quot; and played the role of a special forces commander. Instructor Zhang’s skin was dark, his face was covered with sweat, and the gray and green colors of his camouflage makeup blurred together. He spoke breathlessly and in an uplifting tone. When he asked questions to the team members who were resting on the floor, he always received resounding answers and hearty laughter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Instructor Zhang is a militia member of the Guilin Garrison Area. After retiring from the armed police, he worked as a special warfare training instructor at a military training summer camp in Guangdong for four years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Different from conventional military training, special warfare training imitates the training of our country&#39;s special forces, selecting the most elite &quot;soldiers&quot; and adding subjects such as tactical movements, weapon operation, and wilderness survival. It is more intense and difficult. Instructor Zhang firmly believes that &quot;this kind of education method can truly temper students&#39; bodies and spirits.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The educational concept of &quot;barbaring one&#39;s body&quot; is sometimes accompanied by more voices of incomprehension. Once upon a time, there was a young man who came from Zhejiang for training, and he always practiced gun-holding movements perfunctorily. In order to urge him, Instructor Zhang couldn&#39;t help but said some harsh words: &quot;If you can&#39;t hold a gun well, then you don&#39;t need to eat.&quot; As a result, his parents scolded him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I&#39;m not denying him food, I just want him to experience setbacks and growth. Training is not the purpose. The important thing is to let students learn the valuable qualities of self-improvement, self-reliance, and self-confidence.&quot; Instructor Zhang remembered that when he first joined the army At that time, because I was not holding the gun properly, I was ordered to do the same thing by the squad leader for a whole morning. After that, he practiced diligently and became a model in the army&#39;s tactical training. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, in Guihang, Instructor Zhang rarely has the trouble of not being understood - the special team members are tougher than he imagined. Among Guihang&#39;s 5,000 freshmen participating in the training, more than 80 students from various military training camps passed the selection of height and physical fitness, and finally completed the study and performance of tactics, shooting and other projects. Even if you wear protective gear, rolling, climbing and other actions will inevitably cause arm and leg abrasions. But most people are enthusiastic. Instructor Zhang recalled that a classmate from the Sixth Battalion of the special operations team had a serious muscle strain. After a day of rest, his symptoms improved and he immediately returned to the team for training. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The real battlefield will not leave opportunities to lax soldiers. All the training of the special operations team are highly simulated battlefields. The human ladder construction training is to restore the scene of three people fighting together. Gun training simulates a quick response to an enemy attack. &quot;The simulated gun is relatively heavy, and the students are naughty and occasionally deliberately distort the movement of the gun.&quot; Instructor Zhang will seriously teach him: &quot;When encountering a real attack, the gun must be drawn within 1 second or even 0.1 seconds. The movements must be crisp and clear, and the eyes must be clean.&quot; You have to be keen, otherwise you will be a lamb waiting to be slaughtered.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;About 10% of the people who initially signed up to join the special forces team dropped out. &quot;Special warfare training requires very high physical fitness. Carrying a 1:1 scale simulated rifle that is almost as heavy as a real gun (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 毷体, 毷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;95 (The weight of the rifle is 3.25kg&lt;/span>;) to complete tactical actions, some people are not physically fit enough to do the standard.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Only the special operations team has the opportunity to come into contact with the simulated gun, and students from other companies will start to purely Yu signed up to join the special training team out of curiosity about firearms. Instructor Zhang does not encourage such people to stay because &quot;they are not interested in the special training itself. They just want to take pictures with tanks and armored vehicles. They cannot accept the hard training and cannot keep up with the pace.&quot; In his opinion, only the students themselves are active With participation and cooperation, hard-core training and realistic performances will not be in name only. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/csZ7etnCAfokT74q9Qot5lJZJSRMp9TKLcAYgcqG.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/csZ7etnCAfokT74q9Qot5lJZJSRMp9TKLcAYgcqG.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254439&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Special warfare phalanx display during Guihang military training exhibition&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(provided by interviewee/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p >; &lt;h4>;National Defense Enthusiasts&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;As night falls, the mountains surrounding the campus gradually disappear, the singing of the Mid-Autumn Festival Gala rehearsal is endless, and the lake is full of students running around it. It’s an ordinary Tuesday night at the Huajiang Campus of Guilin University of Electronic Science and Technology (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;hereinafter referred to as &quot;Guidian&quot;&lt;/span>;). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Through the lively playground and stage, in the quiet square, more than 20 members of the Patriotic National Defense Education Association are conducting their daily training. This is a club composed of enthusiasts of national defense knowledge and military training in Guidian. They often participate in the school&#39;s national defense education activities and usually maintain at least two hours of tactical training a week. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to wearing camouflage uniforms, the team members also wore simulated guns, tactical helmets, marching bags, protective gear, and military boots, just like troops going out to perform missions. They are all students participating in this year&#39;s military training for freshmen. At this time, two weeks have passed since the end of the Guidian military training camp. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since its establishment in 2019, the Patriotic National Defense Education Association has selected students who are determined to participate in tactical training for a long time from each new military training class and regularly conducted daily training on infantry combat skills. The core personnel who have undergone long-term training will assist the instructors in completing the tactical training for new students in the second year of military training. In the 2023 Guidian freshmen military training, 150 students from the tactical company were assigned to provide guidance to 30 members of the 21st and 22nd level associations. The person in charge pointed out that this kind of small class teaching can improve the efficiency of training. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many of the participants in the association have the idea of ​​joining the military or the police. Lin Yu, who served as the gunner of the anti-tank team in this military training, applied for the police academy as her first choice in the college entrance examination. Joining the tactical team satisfied her childhood desire to operate firearms. Shen Hong serves as an industrial infantryman responsible for demining. His father was a soldier. Shen Hong&#39;s favorite TV drama character is Li Yunlong. He believes that this tactical training has given him a lot of knowledge and strengthened his ambition to join the army. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Fend off the enemy from the front.&quot; As the squad leader issued the order, the members of the seven-person platoon quickly completed squatting, turning over, and crawling from the stance of marching with guns, with their guns pointing forward. After hearing &quot;defend the enemy from the rear&quot;, the members who were running forward suddenly turned around, slid sideways and lay down, with their guns pointed at the rear. This is an individual soldier action exercise, the association’s most basic training program. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Huang Yilong, chairman and founder of the association and a preparatory class for the children of border guards in 2019, is supervising the training of members. He reminded the squad leader to take the members to a venue without glass ballast to prevent scratches caused by the huge friction with the ground. When Lin Yu fulfilled the command to &quot;lie down while running&quot;, his movements were not coherent enough. Huang Yilonglue jokingly urged the squad leader to correct Lin Yu&#39;s actions. He explained to a reporter from Southern People Weekly, &quot;She slowed down first and then lay down. It was too slow. Now she is dead in the actual combat state. You can see that other people slid down directly from the high speed. She almost slowed down.&quot; If I go on to 0, I will still be afraid.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When talking about the essentials and operational significance of various military actions, Huang Yilong always speaks very fast. He can talk about the &quot;three-point running and shooting position change&quot; in team operations and the obstacle breaking training of the engineering chemical defense team like an encyclopedia. Huang Yilong grew up in a military compound and liked to study various military tactics on his own. He started participating in military clubs in high school. This hobby continued into college and became an ambition. &quot;After graduation, I will either join the army or plunge into research in the military field. I will not be so comfortable doing other jobs.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The plan for the 2023 Guidian military training and the tactical confrontation performance of the red and blue squares is Huang Yilong and the leaders of the training units jointly completed the planning. &quot;Our first tactical display in 2021 will be more conservative, with only infantry and pure attackers. This year, with armored vehicles, blasting tubes and other equipment, we can display more complex tactics, and we have designed offensive and defensive confrontation, engineer barbed wire breaking obstacles and other links.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to Huang Yilong, the military training exercises in Guihang, a ten-minute drive from Guidian, also made reference to this tactical confrontation model. &quot;Guihang&#39;s Military Enthusiasts Association is a fraternal association with us and shares some promotional materials and equipment resources. At the beginning of their association&#39;s establishment, we helped them organize some training. This year, we also seconded guns to Guihang&#39;s freshmen military training. Give it to them.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for the next step in the development of the association, Huang Yilong hopes to form a mutual aid community with more military hobby societies in local universities to exchange more experiences in tactical training. In addition, he plans to enrich tactical training projects. &quot;In the beginning we only had simple training on advancing, kneeling and sliding, and fending off enemies. Later we went up the mountain and carried out infiltration and counter-infiltration operations in the forest. There may be new development directions in the future.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt; img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/VpLyIkjRdB9o98kmFtnycQIKGic5OP5m1r3hIaR3.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;540&quot; data-src=&quot; //images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/VpLyIkjRdB9o98kmFtnycQIKGic5OP5m1r3hIaR3.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254442&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Guidian Patriotic National Defense Education Association conducts woodland infiltration and counter-infiltration training near the school&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(provided by interviewee/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4 >;Resources and Culture&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;It takes about 50 minutes to drive from Guilin North Railway Station in the direction of Yaoshan Scenic Area to reach Guihang and Guidian. They are only one stop apart on the route of bus number 13. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Both schools are surrounded by mountains, covering vast areas, far away from the bustling city, and seem to be specially designed for Qing Dynasty. Unless it is a holiday, there are few vehicles passing by on the mountain roads surrounding the school. In the nearby Yaoshan Scenic Area, there are dense forests and gentle slopes. The surrounding environment provides the school with a suitable place for field training and simulated jungle combat. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Guihang chose Yaoshan for training. The person in charge of the school&#39;s armed forces department explained, &quot;With more than 5,000 people training, safety is the first priority. In addition, we must also meet everyone&#39;s needs for exercise, so we walked to the mountains where there are few cars.&quot; The members of the special operations team used trees and grass to For cover, they wore gas masks and simulated woodland infiltration, jungle manhunts and other activities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The supply of military training equipment benefits from cooperation between universities and between universities and military institutions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Guidian’s imitation armored vehicles and rocket launchers are all seconded from Guilin Military Expo Park. Staff of the Military Expo Park revealed that Guidian’s national flag guard team will also come to the Military Expo Park to perform. The simulated guns and gas masks were loaned from the Army Special Warfare College. You Jiangjiao, chief of the Comprehensive Section of the Guidian Armed Forces Department, said that over three days, nearly 10,000 military training students took turns to experience shooting simulated guns. Guidian, the current deputy minister of the Armed Forces, once worked at the Army Special Warfare Academy. In order for the performance to go smoothly, he took the initiative to help the students borrow 55 marching bags from a unit in Qifeng Town. Some of the simulated mortars, tanks, firearms and other equipment used in Guihang&#39;s military training are provided by the school&#39;s military associations, and some are seconded from the Guilin Garrison District. Guidian, Guilin and other universities will also lend some equipment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In recent years, real gun and live ammunition shooting in military training in colleges and universities has gradually been replaced by simulated gun shooting. You Jiangjiao pointed out, &quot;Shooting with real guns is too dangerous. The real guns borrowed by the school are mainly disassembled for students to learn.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Teachers from the armed forces departments of the two schools believe that the school&#39;s emphasis on military training Investing more resources will help enhance students’ national defense awareness and promote military recruitment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As part of national defense education, military training is also a window for ordinary students to understand the life of the army. The person in charge of the Guihang Armed Forces Department once conducted a post-training survey on the students of the school. He found that the previous military training, which had a single form and lacked equipment support, made many students question the meaning of military training: &quot;If the military training showed students all about going forward and standing in military postures, they would also find military life boring like this. It is difficult to yearn for the army. Military training adds activities such as tactical training and enriches the form to more comprehensively reflect the real life in the military camp and allow students to understand the specific needs of national defense. This can inspire their enthusiasm and belief in joining the army.&quot;&lt;/p >; &lt;p>;Li Ming, a retired soldier from the Guilin Garrison District, has a military dream that was cultivated by the military training experience he witnessed in his childhood. His parents are teachers at Guilin Forestry School. Since elementary school, Li Ming has often observed the military training of this technical secondary school after school. At that time, the use of firearms accounted for a large proportion of military training courses, and Li Ming, who was watching from the sidelines, was always clamoring to play with firearms. When Li Ming was in junior high school, instructor Chen often came to this school to train students. He often played with Li Ming, who was unwilling to do homework, and taught him a lot of military knowledge. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One day, Instructor Chen accidentally broke his arm while demonstrating a certain movement. Other instructors quickly rushed forward to check the wound and sent Instructor Chen to the infirmary. This scene deeply inspired Li Ming: &quot;I am an only child born in the 1990s. I can only cry alone when I am injured. When the instructor is injured, his comrades are a solid backing. We study with peace of mind, and the soldiers are also our backing, protecting everyone and the children. The safety of my home.&quot; Li Ming determined to be a soldier who can become the backing of the country. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Today, he is also an instructor at Guihang Military Training. He hopes that the seeds that instructor Chen once planted in his heart will also be planted in the hearts of Guihang students. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Is hard-core military training suitable for more people?&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The resources of the special operations training model cannot benefit everyone who participates in military training. Among the more than 5,000 freshmen participating in the training at Guihang, except for more than 80 members of the special operations team, other students rarely have the opportunity to come into contact with simulated firearms. Courses on square formations such as split formation and prisoner boxing are still based on formation training. For safety reasons, those who drive armored vehicles and tanks are instructors who have obtained driver&#39;s licenses. Students can only take photos with these models or sit on them to experience them. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A classmate of the split company felt a little regretful that he did not have the courage to sign up for the special operations company: &quot;Although it is more difficult, I can also learn a lot of military skills and experience more military life. It&#39;s a pity that I I wear glasses. During the selection, the instructor said that the movements may break the glasses, and those wearing glasses cannot participate. In addition, there are height requirements, and those with martial arts and dance foundations are given priority. I don’t seem to be good enough.&quot;&lt;/p >; &lt;p>;Wang Zhipeng, a lecturer in the Military Teaching and Research Office of Xi&#39;an Jiaotong University, said that the emergence of special training models in military training is to meet the military training needs of different types of students: &quot;In recent years, colleges and universities have expanded their enrollment, and the number of participants has continued to increase. The physical fitness and adaptability of students have There are differences, and some high-intensity training may not be suitable for all students. Similar activities are also held in the national student military training camps organized by the Ministry of Education and the National Defense Mobilization Department of the Central Military Commission to provide students with good physical fitness and deep national defense sentiments. A platform for growth, experience and advancement.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to the threshold of student quality, special warfare training itself also has higher requirements for resources such as venues and equipment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The biggest headache for instructor Zhang, who is in charge of Guihang’s special training, is the lack of softer training venues. During special training and movements such as rolling and lying down, the hard cement floor will aggravate the students&#39; scratches. However, the plastic badminton court on Guihang South Campus cannot be used because it is close to classrooms for other grades. The playground with a 400-meter track in the North Campus needs to be shared by 7 camps. Instructor Zhang sometimes felt a little crowded, so he had to take the team to a corner of the playground for training. They had only rehearsed the full tactical display with ample space once. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Guidian’s way of solving the problem is to make full use of the roads on campus. You Jiangjiao pointed out, &quot;By clearing the electric vehicles parked on the road to one side, the area of ​​the training venue can be increased, and the separated teams can train here.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Universities such as Guihang and Guidian, It has a military-industrial nature, and it is more convenient to communicate with the local military region and borrow resources such as simulated firearms during military training. But in general colleges and universities, it is relatively difficult to borrow. Xi&#39;an Jiaotong University&#39;s approach is for the school to purchase its own military training teaching aids. The special training team always has more than 40 model guns, and other students can only get 2-3 guns per company on average. The average price of a model gun is a few hundred yuan. If it is to ensure that every student participating in the training has one like a special training team, it will also be a big expense for a school that provides military training for five to six thousand freshmen. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Zhipeng believes that the implementation of the compulsory content required by the &quot;Military Course Syllabus for General Colleges and Universities&quot; (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;such as light weapons shooting, battlefield medical treatment First aid, etc.&lt;/span>;), so that more ordinary students can have the experience of hard-core military training, it is necessary to &quot;increase resource investment, strengthen policy supply, and create a professional team of national defense education teachers. At the same time, teaching must incorporate the latest technologies VR, The introduction of informatization and intelligent equipment such as drones into military training will enhance the four flavors of military training, namely fun, military flavor, war flavor and technological flavor, and improve student participation and educational effect.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(At the request of the interviewee, Lin Yu, Shen Hong, and Li Ming in the article are pseudonyms.)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt; /p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 21 Oct 2023 20:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[国常会审议通过《人体器官捐献和移植条例（修订草案）》]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259053]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-21 19:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Li Qiang presided over the executive meeting of the State Council&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;State Council&#39;s Notice on Cancellation and Adjustment of a Group of Decision on Fine Matters&quot; and &quot;Regulations on Human Organ Donation and Transplantation (Revised Draft)&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Premier Li Qiang chaired an executive meeting of the State Council on October 20 to review and adopt the &quot;State Council&#39;s Notice on Cancellation and Adjustment of a Group of Fine Matters&quot; Decision&quot; and &quot;Human Organ Donation and Transplantation Regulations (Revised Draft)&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The meeting pointed out that strictly regulating penalties and fine standards is an important measure to optimize the business environment and reduce operating costs. It is necessary to continue to reduce fines and reduce fines that violate legal authority, do not meet the needs of economic and social development, and can be managed in other ways. It is necessary to strictly regulate the discretionary power of administrative penalties, intensify efforts to rectify arbitrary fines, improve collaborative governance and joint punishment mechanisms, seriously investigate and punish behaviors such as the administration of fines and excessive fines, increase exposure to the society, and prevent all types of benefits. The effect of corporate policies is weakened or offset. Efforts should be made to strengthen interim and ex-post supervision, improve supervision methods, standardize supervision procedures, improve supervision efficiency, and effectively strengthen supervision in key areas such as production safety, life and health, and product quality, so as to provide strong support for promoting high-quality development. According to the meeting&#39;s deliberations, it is planned to cancel and adjust 33 fines in administrative regulations and departmental rules as a package. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The meeting emphasized that human organ donation and transplantation are acts of great love and charity in the world, related to the lives and health of the people, bioethics and social justice, and are an important symbol of the development of national medicine and the progress of social civilization. We must put people and life first, further regulate human organ donation and transplantation, ensure the quality of medical care, protect human health, and safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of citizens. It is necessary to take this revision of the regulations as an opportunity to strengthen legal protection, establish a full-process traceability and supervision mechanism, strengthen the construction of the organ donation work system, strengthen the ethical review of organ procurement, crack down on and investigate organ-related crimes in accordance with the law, and better protect the organ donation and The transplantation industry is developing healthily. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Other matters were also considered at the meeting. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 21 Oct 2023 19:55:03 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
