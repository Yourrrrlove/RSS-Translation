Many domestic travel agencies have started selling Antarctic tour projects. The price of a trip is basically more than 100,000 yuan, and some high-end routes can be as high as 300,000 to 400,000 yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;For a long time, the Antarctic trip has been a niche high-end project. Many people don’t know about it. This is the first time for many people to hear that it is okay. Travel to Antarctica. Is traveling to Antarctica difficult and expensive? Is traveling to Antarctica a matter of spending money to enjoy the unique beauty, or is it &quot;spending money to buy suffering&quot;? Will many people traveling to Antarctica damage the ecological environment of Antarctica? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/31/Ry46lJqqtjt2vMlY9w62dFLPyCkmUXDliLD7DCL3.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/31/Ry46lJqqtjt2vMlY9w62dFLPyCkmUXDliLD7DCL3.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;256199&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（IC photo/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; >;&lt;strong>;Is it difficult to travel to Antarctica&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Antarctica is the southernmost point of the earth. It is the last one to be discovered on the earth and the only one without humans. A continent where people live and settle. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;For a long time in the past, Antarctica was a mysterious place in the world until Antarctica was discovered in 1820. Since then, Antarctica has also been mainly used as a scientific research base. In December 1911, the Norwegian Amundsen expedition reached the Antarctic Pole for the first time. In 1985, my country established a scientific research station in Antarctica for the first time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In fact, Antarctica is also a tourist destination. In the 1950s, the world&#39;s first international tourist group of 500 people went to Antarctica, and Antarctic tourism officially appeared. 2007 was the first year for China to launch Antarctic tourism, and China’s first officially recognized Antarctic tour line was completed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;According to statistics from the International Association of Antarctic Tourism Operators (IAATO), China is the second largest source of tourists to Antarctica. In the 2017-2018 Antarctic tourism season, a total of 51,707 tourists from around the world visited Antarctica, and the number of Chinese tourists reached 8,273, accounting for 16%, second only to the United States. A total of 1,464 Chinese people went to Antarctica in the 2022-23 Antarctic season. It is expected that in the 2023-24 Antarctic tourism season, Chinese tourists will return to 80% of the pre-epidemic number. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Antarctica does not have four seasons, only two seasons, namely the warm season (November-March) and the cold season (April-October). The warm season is also the tourist season in Antarctica, because it is almost daytime and the temperature is higher, making it more suitable for tourism. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Theoretically, as long as it is the Antarctic tourist season, everyone can travel to Antarctica, because traveling to Antarctica does not require a visa, and Antarctica does not belong to any nation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;From a practical point of view, traveling to Antarctica is difficult. After all, our country does not have direct commercial flights to Antarctica. Tourists must first go to a country relatively close to Antarctica. , such as Argentina, Australia or New Zealand, and then go to Antarctica via cruise ships or flights from these transit countries. Therefore, if you want to apply for a transit country visa when going to Antarctica, you also need the help and services of a professional travel company. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/31/bcdfUdi8XYsJEq5ytx0qk74142tITCWOEmb4Y18g.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;722&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/31/bcdfUdi8XYsJEq5ytx0qk74142tITCWOEmb4Y18g.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;256198&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（IC photo/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; >;&lt;strong>;Appreciate beauty, or buy into suffering? &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;As you can imagine, Antarctica has breathtaking beauty. 98% of the Antarctic continent is covered with ice and snow all year round, making people feel like they are in a pure white world, which is extremely clear and translucent from the eyes to the soul. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Here, tourists will tremble at the miraculous workmanship of nature. They can enjoy the natural landscape of eternal daylight and interact with the masters of Antarctica - penguins, Blue whales, sea lions and various seagulls coexist harmoniously and happily...&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Antarctic tours can provide us with exclusive experiences that cannot be experienced anywhere else in the world. In order to enrich the fun of the journey, travel companies will also carry out outdoor activities such as hiking, kayaking and camping in Antarctica. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Going to Antarctica to appreciate the beauty behind it also requires paying a high cost. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Behind the long journey is the sound of money disappearing. Nowadays, the mainstream Antarctic tourism projects in China are to fly from China to Argentina first, and then take a cruise to Antarctica via Argentina. The departure point of most cruise ships is Ushuaia, the southernmost tip of Argentina. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The flight from China to Buenos Aires, Argentina takes about 40 hours (and you have to endure the troublesome transfer). It takes a long time to take a cruise from the Argentine port to sea. It takes between 2 and 5 days of sailing time to reach the Antarctic continent. Tourists can choose to spend only a few days in the Antarctic continent; they can also choose &quot;Antarctic Peninsula + Antarctic Circle&quot;, which will sail southward through the Antarctic Circle based on the Antarctic Peninsula. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;A trip to Antarctica can take about ten days if it is short, or twenty or thirty days if it is long. Depending on the aircraft cabin, cruise class and accommodation environment, the price also varies greatly. For example, the prices of various cruise companies are basically 60,000-200,000 yuan per person. Therefore, the total cost of a trip to Antarctica ranges from 70,000 to 80,000 yuan for a cheap trip to 30,000 to 400,000 yuan for an expensive trip, or even higher. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The challenge of traveling to Antarctica is not only the high price, but also the &quot;suffering&quot; during the journey. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Cruise ships arriving at the Antarctic continent basically have to pass through the Drake Strait. This is the widest strait in the world and the deepest strait in the world. Due to the influence of polar cyclones, there are strong winds and huge waves all year round. The wind force is basically above level 8 all year round. When a cruise ship passes through it, the hull will inevitably shake violently, and the probability of seasickness and vomiting among tourists is extremely high, so much so that there is a saying, &quot;If you haven&#39;t fainted once in the Drake Passage, don&#39;t say you have been to Antarctica.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Tourists who travel to Antarctica often have polarizing opinions about this journey. Some people think that the trip is worthwhile and it is a unique experience in life. Some people frankly say that spending money to buy the experience makes Antarctic travel &quot;so cold, so far, so expensive, and so boring.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Will tourism harm Antarctica&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Antarctica is recognized by the world It is a nature reserve shared by all mankind, and the protection of Antarctica has long been established in the form of international conventions. On December 1, 1959, the Antarctic Treaty was signed and came into effect on June 23, 1961. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The &quot;Antarctic Convention&quot; aims to restrict the activities of various countries in Antarctica, the only continent on earth without a permanent population, and ensure that countries respect Antarctica. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In 1991, the Special Meeting of the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Countries adopted the &quot;Antarctic Treaty Protocol on Environmental Protection&quot; with a view to environmental protection in Antarctica. As one of the negotiating countries, China signed the protocol. The protocol sets out strict protection measures to protect the ecological environment of the Antarctic continent and nearby areas from damage. Later, the International Association of Antarctic Tourism Operators also issued the &quot;Activity Guide for Antarctic Tourism Practitioners&quot; and the &quot;Activity Guide for Antarctic Tourists&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Under the constraints of these treaties, travel to Antarctica must abide by some principles. For example, large ships cannot stay in a certain place for more than 5 hours; each trip to the island Only 100 people can log in; you cannot take the initiative to get within 5 meters of the penguins; you must clean your shoes after disembarking from the boat and returning to the boat to avoid biological invasion, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;However, climate disasters have already had a serious impact on Antarctic ecology. As the Earth heats up, Antarctic glaciers are melting and becoming more fragile. Research shows that from 1997 to 2021, more than 40% of Antarctic ice shelves have shrunk significantly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Nowadays, frequent human travel activities may make the Antarctic snow melt faster. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Last year, a paper published in Nature Communications pointed out that black carbon pollution at tourist arrival points in Antarctica may increase these area of ​​snowmelt. The burning of fossil and biomass fuels creates black carbon, which absorbs light and heats the atmosphere. If black carbon falls on snow, it melts faster. As a result, environmentalists loudly shouted: Please reduce unnecessary Antarctic travel and protect the natural ecology. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Embarrassingly, many domestic companies that launch Antarctic tour projects promote one of the reasons for Antarctic tours is that &quot;some Antarctic glaciers are melting at an accelerating rate and are losing their The original natural beauty. The earlier you go, the less likely you will be able to see the most primitive Antarctic continent and retain the beauty and primitiveness that is about to disappear!&quot; However, the arrival of more and more tourists is exacerbating the melting of Antarctic ice and snow and destroying the beauty of Antarctica. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;This does not mean that all Antarctic tours should be cancelled. Man and nature can coexist harmoniously. However, it is indeed necessary to speed up the use of clean energy in Antarctic tourism, limit the number of tourists, strengthen the supervision of Antarctic tourism, and strengthen the implementation of the Antarctic Treaty, so as to minimize the negative impact of human activities in Antarctica on the Antarctic ecology. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 02 Nov 2023 21:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[威马破产重整，车主面临“售后难”：购置电车须评估六大风险]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259689]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-02 20:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;According to the National Enterprise Bankruptcy and Reorganization Case Information Network, WM Motor Technology Group Co., Ltd. has applied for bankruptcy and reorganization WM Motor&#39;s official Weibo issued a notification letter in response, saying that the company still has salvage value and hopes to actively save itself by adjusting corporate strategies, solving financial debt problems, and getting investors to participate in restructuring and development. However, according to feedback from many WM owners, in early 2023, WM supporting software frequently experienced failures such as &quot;unable to connect, network abnormality&quot; and so on. In response to this, WM Motor publicly responded: &quot;Currently, WM Motor&#39;s engine system has returned to normal, and we sincerely apologize for the inconvenience caused to everyone!&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Judging from the current situation, if we cannot wait for the &quot;White Horse Rider&quot; &quot;Once WM Motor goes bankrupt, more than 100,000 car owners will face a &quot;complete shutdown&quot; of their vehicle systems. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The main components of electric vehicles have changed from the engine and gearbox of previous fuel vehicles to three-electric systems. In the electric vehicle maintenance market, new energy vehicle-related product technologies and parts supply are all mastered In the hands of OEMs and EMC manufacturers, independent repairers rarely participate. This means that when electric vehicle companies such as WM Motor are eliminated due to factors such as fierce market competition, the after-sales service chain will be broken, and car owners will not be able to find corresponding substitutes in the market. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The experience of a Weimar owner is a typical example. The power battery of the WM EX5 car he purchased malfunctioned. When it was charged to 80%, it would automatically jump to 100%. When the remaining 20% ​​of power was used, the car would stop moving. Because it was still within the manufacturer&#39;s warranty period, the car owner drove the car to the Kuangshan store of Jinan Weima User Center for repair. It still has not been repaired in nearly half a year because the manufacturer did not provide spare parts. The car owner contacted the 4S store again, and the 4S store said that it could no longer operate and asked him to tow the car away and solve the problem himself. The car owner also complained to the manufacturer many times, but it has not been resolved. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Weima owners are facing &quot;after-sales difficulties&quot;, which reveals that electric cars are not as beautiful as the owners imagined. Due to strong policy support, China&#39;s electric vehicle industry has developed rapidly. The latest statistics released by the Ministry of Public Security show that the number of electric vehicles in China currently exceeds 18 million. However, with the rapid development of electric vehicles, there are still six major risks. In addition to the difficulties encountered by Weimar owners mentioned above, they also involve aspects such as cruising range, charging, vehicle safety, data and privacy, and assisted driving. When buying a car, car owners must not Not aware. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some electric vehicle manufacturers deliberately exaggerate the cruising range of their vehicles in order to promote sales. According to a report by China Times in March this year, most new energy vehicle 4S stores marked the NEDC comprehensive working condition (driving cycle test) cruising range and did not mark the actual cruising range. Mr. Liu, an online ride-hailing driver, told a reporter from China Times that an electric car he mentioned in May 2022 had a range of 505 kilometers, but in actual driving, whether it was driving on the highway or in the city, , the cruising range can only reach about 300 kilometers, and in winter it only has more than 200 kilometers, and once it even &quot;slumped down&quot; on the highway. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The cruising range is not worthy of its name, and electric vehicles charge slowly, often taking six to eight hours to fully charge. This greatly affects the consumer experience. Especially when there is an urgent need for a car, long charging time will make consumers feel very inconvenient. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this regard, electric vehicle companies have provided two options. One is the DC fast charging mode, which takes 1 to 1.5 hours. However, frequent use of fast charging mode will affect battery life. Therefore, current electric vehicles still mainly rely on AC slow charging. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Secondly, some car companies provide battery swapping models, but the costs for car owners are high. At the same time, the investment cost of battery swapping stations is high and the number of built ones is limited. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The safety of electric vehicles is another major pain point that consumers are concerned about. In recent years, there have been many accidents involving spontaneous combustion of electric vehicles, posing a serious threat to the life and property safety of car owners. Statistics from the emergency management department show that in the first quarter of 2023 alone, the spontaneous combustion rate of electric vehicles increased by 32%, with an average of 8 electric vehicles catching fire (including spontaneous combustion) every day. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One of the directions for the intelligentization of electric vehicles is digitization. Electric vehicles can not only collect the owner’s face data through the in-car camera, but may also collect information such as the owner’s place of residence, whereabouts, and consumption places. , once such data is leaked by car companies or stolen by hackers, it will cause more serious consequences. According to a notice issued by the Maine Attorney General&#39;s Office in August this year, Tesla&#39;s data breach in May affected more than 75,000 people, including records related to employees. The incident originated from &quot;internal Employee misconduct”. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The application of assisted driving technology in electric vehicles will bring more problems. Some car companies refer to assisted driving technology as &quot;assisted autonomous driving&quot; or &quot;autonomous assisted driving&quot;. Sales staff will hype it up when promoting, beautifying it as &quot;autonomous driving&quot;. If there is an accident, it will become &quot;assisted driving&quot;. . The assisted driving technology used by many electric vehicles currently has a paradox in itself. It not only advocates liberating the driver, but also requires the driver to supervise and be ready to take over anytime and anywhere. If an accident occurs, how to divide the responsibilities between the driver and the car company? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some of the six major risks associated with electric vehicles may be improved with technological advancement, while others may remain unresolved for a long time. Therefore, when people buy electric vehicles, they must not be concerned about the risks promoted by car companies. &quot;Environmental protection&quot; (the degree of environmental pollution caused by batteries is not low) and &quot;intelligence&quot; are fully accepted, but it is still necessary to evaluate rationally and objectively before deciding whether to place an order. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 02 Nov 2023 20:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[国务院印发《关于取消和调整一批罚款事项的决定》]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259818]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-02 19:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;In order to further optimize the business environment, the State Council recently issued the &quot;Decision on Cancellation and Adjustment of a Group of Fines&quot; ( (hereinafter referred to as the &quot;Decision&quot;), 33 fines were canceled and adjusted in the fields of industry, information technology, housing and urban-rural construction, among which 16 fines were canceled and 17 fines were adjusted. If fine matters are canceled, the relevant fine provisions in relevant administrative regulations and departmental rules will be temporarily suspended from the date of issuance of the &quot;Decision&quot;; if fines are adjusted, the relevant fine provisions in the revised relevant administrative regulations and departmental rules will be implemented. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The 16 fines canceled by the &quot;Decision&quot; include 2 from the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, 2 from the Ministry of Education, 5 from the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development, 3 from the People&#39;s Bank of China, and 1 from the National Forestry and Grassland Administration. , 1 State Post Bureau, 2 National Bureau of Disease Control and Prevention; 17 fines adjusted, including 1 Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, 1 Ministry of Emergency Management, 13 National Press and Publication Administration, and 2 National Bureau of Disease Control and Prevention. These fines are mainly concentrated in areas closely related to the production and life of enterprises and the people. The purpose of cancellation and adjustment is to effectively reduce the burden on enterprises and the people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The cancellation and adjustment of fines involve a total of 7 administrative regulations and 6 departmental regulations. The &quot;Decision&quot; puts forward clear requirements for the legislative work after the cancellation and adjustment of fines. Relevant departments of the State Council must submit relevant administrative regulations modification plans to the State Council within 60 days from the date of issuance of the &quot;Decision&quot; and complete the modification and abolition of relevant departmental regulations. If departmental regulations need to be adjusted according to the revised administrative regulations, the modification and abolition must be completed within 60 days from the date of promulgation of the relevant administrative regulations. Considering that there is a 30-day period for soliciting opinions on the modification and abolition of departmental regulations, it is stipulated that if the modification or abolition of departmental regulations cannot be completed within the above period due to special reasons, it may be appropriately extended, but the extension period shall not exceed 30 days at most. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Decision&quot; emphasizes that after the fines are cancelled, the relevant departments must study carefully in accordance with the law, strictly implement regulatory responsibilities, focus on strengthening supervision during and after the event, improve supervision methods, standardize supervision procedures, and improve the scientific and scientific nature of supervision. Simplicity and precision further enhance regulatory efficiency and provide strong support for promoting high-quality development. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 02 Nov 2023 19:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[“丑小鸭”的生长：一所学校防治青少年抑郁的探索与思考]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259838]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-02 17:58:46&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 11/01/epeeemYXf9dkI727T4PbzTs2ff4ZarA2VMg8Hxh4.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1578&quot; height=&quot;1106&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/epeeemYXf9dkI727T4PbzTs2ff4Z arA2VMg8Hxh4. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256486&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On October 19, 2023, girls confided and comforted each other on the playground of Ugly Duckling Middle School &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern People Weekly reporter Weng Huan/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Did you want to come here on your own, or were you &#39;tricked&#39; by your parents?&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Half and half. When I came here, I realized, hey, it&#39;s not at all what I thought.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Under the bright sun, more than a dozen buses and minibuses were parked here. The mountainside of Ruixing Village in Yiliang, Kunming. Hundreds of people filed in, lingering in the classrooms, student dormitories, book bars, and running tracks of this rural school, observing carefully, even the bathrooms painted with paint. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Visitors include principals, moral education directors, classroom teachers from all over the country, officials and entrepreneurs from the local education sector, social organizations engaged in family education and private innovative education, as well as some who “can’t figure it out” in their own families. Parents worried about their children. They were curious about how a school called &quot;Ugly Duckling Middle School&quot; could help a group of children who seemed to be surly, tired of studying, or even suffering from deep depression to blossom into a natural and brilliant life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For these questions, the &quot;ugly duckling&quot; principal Zhan Danian always smiles and does not answer immediately. In the 13 years since he founded this school, various questions and controversies have continued, which he no longer thinks is strange. But he did not expect that the youth depression problem that he had deeply realized in running the school would actually trigger a strong response after launching the &quot;First Youth Psychological Safety Forum&quot; (jointly with the China Education Thirty Forum), and the reverberation continues to this day. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;2023 China Mental Health&quot; Blue Book released on October 10, 2023 shows that 40% of Chinese teenagers feel lonely, the depression detection rate among high school students is 40%, and the depression detection rate among junior high school students is 40%. is 50%, and the risk of mild anxiety among college students is 38%. Peng Kaiping, dean of the Academy of Social Sciences of Tsinghua University, once wrote an article pointing out that today&#39;s Chinese teenagers have &quot;four no&#39;s&quot;: no interest in learning, no interest in the real world, no ability to deal with the real society, and no interest in life. Therefore, the theme of this forum has been upgraded from the previously mentioned &quot;youth mental health&quot; to &quot;psychological safety&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/BcDl53HOeKhBlcjWZsACyCKlrhO9mJTFm3q4LvX9.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;546&quot; height= &quot;364&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/BcDl53HOeKhBlcjWZsACyCKlrhO9mJTFm3q4LvX9.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256482&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In the psychology room of Ugly Duckling Middle School, teacher Li Guihong (middle) performs sand table psychotherapy for students. Some students also sit quietly and relax here&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;( Southern People Weekly reporter Weng Huan/picture) &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Zhan Danian’s view, depression is just a symptom, and behind it are the flaws in the current educational ecology. &quot;The essence of education is to develop students&#39; personalities, rather than using a ruler to measure students. The best and most equitable education should be education that adapts to students&#39; personalities, so that every student&#39;s potential can be developed.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We have actually heard this argument too many times. The key is how to put it into practice. Therefore, in the &quot;wild education&quot; of the &quot;ugly duckling&quot;, is there really any experience that can be discovered and learned from to prevent and treat depression in teenagers? What kind of social and family symptoms are behind every depressed child? Are they definitely unsolvable? Our reporters went to Kunming and Yiliang to explore the possibility of dispelling the shadow of education under the sun. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/cnGVQpHqsTRAN5BW8PNj5Om1pOjzY81isic8ZjO9.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;545&quot; height= &quot;364&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/cnGVQpHqsTRAN5BW8PNj5Om1pOjzY81isic8ZjO9.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256483&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;At 11:30 in the morning, the students of Ugly Duckling Middle School were having physical education class.

But in the crowd, with her dark face, ponytail, and big black-rimmed glasses, she didn&#39;t often make a sound. On a 30℃ day, my body is still huddled in a collared sweater and a jacket. When you open your mouth, the sound coming out of the braces is very soft, like a porcelain bowl that is afraid of breaking. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I noticed her in class. In the Chinese class of teacher Juanjuan in the second grade of junior high school, Pu Pu raised her hand, which surprised me, who initially thought she would not want to speak. But two minutes later, she lowered her head and body, and closed her eyes, as if everything around her had nothing to do with her. This state of affairs occurs constantly in the classroom. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;It&#39;s a reaction after taking medicine.&quot; Psychology teacher Li Guihong told me. When he first arrived at &quot;The Ugly Duckling&quot;, Pu Pu had to take more than 20 pills of medication to treat mental illness at a time, but now the medication has been reduced by more than half. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;More than two years ago, Pu Pu was in the first grade of junior high school in Kunming, a middle school known for its academic performance. Like other branches of this education group, almost nothing is allowed here that is not related to study. It is strictly forbidden to move or talk during meals and lunch breaks. If you are &quot;disobedient&quot;, the dormitory aunt will record your name, deduct points, and scold you. Pu Pu once had his name recorded because he took a few minutes longer to take a shower. He got a little excited while chatting with his classmates at noon, so he was also recorded. &quot;The punishment is a slap on the palm, but it doesn&#39;t hurt. There is also running, which requires many laps.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Don&#39;t you think this kind of management is a bit strict?&quot; I asked her. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;It doesn&#39;t count. I broke the rules in the first place, and it&#39;s all my fault.&quot; She answered quietly in the rest area next to the &quot;Ugly Duckling&quot; playground. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After reading for a while, Pu Pu began to suffer from insomnia and developed delusional symptoms. &quot;Sometimes I feel happy, and sometimes I feel uncomfortable. When I feel uncomfortable, I can&#39;t control myself and scream loudly.&quot; She asked her parents to see a psychiatrist. Later, she was diagnosed with &quot;depression and anxiety disorder&quot; and was admitted to the hospital. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Pu Pu’s parents run a dental clinic and are very caring towards her. &quot;During the time I was hospitalized, my father was at work and my mother often stayed with me in the hospital.&quot; She had undergone MECT (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 毷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;non-convulsive electroshock&lt;/span>; ) and transcranial magnetism (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;physical device that stimulates brain nerves&lt;/span>;) treatments, except for dizziness and numbness, did not have much effect. Pu Pu dropped out of school. In the past two years, she gained weight due to medication and other reasons. Her heaviest weight was close to 70 kilograms. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/TJoN8oef5Juq9tWKgF4rQvSNw2dkpGJCEAFagyfE.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;449&quot; height= &quot;337&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/TJoN8oef5Juq9tWKgF4rQvSNw2dkpGJCEAFagyfE.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256485&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Aerial view of the Ugly Duckling Middle School campus&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern People Weekly reporter Weng Huan/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p >;Bad moods still came up from time to time like a tide. When she couldn&#39;t stand it anymore, Pu Pu would hit her head against the wall, cry, and pinch her throat with her hands... More than once, she wanted to open the window and jump. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are other ways. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Rolling up her sleeves, Pu Pu’s arms, from palm to elbow, were densely covered with new flesh that was a minute or two thicker than the original skin after twenty or thirty cuts with a knife, like a row. Light-colored thorns winding up. There are several more in the middle, which are longer, deeper, and redder in color. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Does it hurt when you paddle?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;No.&quot; She shook her head and smiled. &quot;Seeing blood relieves stress.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In those late nights when she couldn&#39;t get through it, patients she met while she was in the hospital sent her messages and asked her to try other methods, such as scratching paper, throwing stuffed toys, and picking at the wall. &quot;They also advised me not to think about (suicide) so much. Some (symptoms) are milder than yours, and some are more severe than yours. You will definitely get better slowly.&quot; After hearing these kind words of comfort, Pu Pu would stop. &quot;I actually don&#39;t believe what they said. But when I think about how hard it was for my parents to give birth to and raise me, I can&#39;t just give up.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;You still think that suffering from mental illness is all a matter of Is it my own problem?&quot; I asked her again. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Well... I didn&#39;t adjust my mentality well. I used to have low self-esteem. I didn&#39;t like my skin being so dark. It turned out that my classmates at school called me &#39;black girl&#39;. I was unhappy and also I keep it in my heart.&quot; She raised her head and opened her eyes: &quot;But I am optimistic now. I don&#39;t think there is any problem with being black. And my mother said that there are many medical beauty methods now. If I want, I can also have whitening when I grow up. .&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A year ago, Pu Pu was sent as an &quot;ugly duckling&quot;. &quot;She didn&#39;t like to laugh very much and couldn&#39;t integrate into the group.&quot; During the &quot;attack&quot;, she trembled all over and pulled her hair, causing two people to suffer. Only then can she be held back. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Both Zhan Danian and Li Guihong said that adults need to pay attention to children&#39;s paddling and &quot;self-injury&quot;, but do not need to be too frightened. &quot;Some are seeking stimulation, some are subconscious, and some are emotional releases. They may want you to see it. What you have to do is to give them enough understanding and protection.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For various physical symptoms and stress In response, Li Guihong recorded her experience in the industry for more than ten years in a notebook, as well as some practices she learned from Liu Zhiyou, a special psychological consultant for &quot;The Ugly Duckling&quot; and a Taiwanese brain science expert: when dealing with children with trembling hands and feet, first touch them gently. If they have violent behaviors such as hitting the wall, you can give them electrolyte water and touch other parts of the body. After the child calmed down a little, she also taught the student the &quot;Flat Throwing Kung Fu&quot;: half-squatting, slowly shaking both hands up and down. Sometimes she would also give the children some lemon slices, &quot;I said eating this will make them feel better quickly, and psychological suggestions can also work.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images. infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/CpuvdptotWQHlYpaDKBAVn7smjmQGGQ6cJciqfkk.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;441&quot; height=&quot;294&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/ medias/image/23/11/01/CpuvdptotWQHlYpaDKBAVn7smjmQGGQ6cJciqfkk.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256484&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Ugly Duckling Middle School Boys Dormitory&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern People Weekly reporter Weng Huan/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During class time and after class in the afternoon, students will always enter the first floor in twos and threes. This psych room on the left. They hugged the big furry bears on the sofas and cushions; some would chat with &quot;Lao Li&quot; - this is their pet name for Li Guihong; some spent half an hour drawing mandoles in the cubicle. Luo (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;A painting therapy invented by psychologist Jung&lt;/span>;). &quot;Old Li, why haven&#39;t my paintings been hung up?&quot; A child said, half coquettishly and half angrily. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;How about you draw a more interesting one? I will consider it later.&quot; Li Guihong secretly told me, asking whether this child is a student specializing in art. &quot;I have to give other children more opportunities.&quot; I suddenly remembered that when I visited the girls&#39; dormitory on the first day, there were several girls on the upper bunk with their legs curled up and their heads raised, painting, and one of them was Pu Pu. In the &quot;Ugly Duckling&quot;, all greening and interior and exterior decorations are completed by students according to their own wishes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;No one seems to regard this psychological room with warm colors as a therapeutic place. It has naturally become a transfer station, chat room and tea room for emotional flow. &quot;They are willing to come here for no particular purpose. They can relax and clear their minds. That&#39;s good.&quot; Li Guihong said. When encountering a child like Pu Pu who needs special treatment, if she is willing to chat, she and her colleague Yang Haoming will divide the work; if not, the first thing to do is still: give time and wait. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Only when the child&#39;s emotions are relatively intense and several people have &#39;attacks&#39; at the same time, I feel a little powerless.&quot; She smiled, &quot;But there are other teachers who can take turns to deal with it, so don&#39;t be afraid.&quot;&lt;/p>; p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/vMJ3G8t4amWuAREHAtZnY6sTReZXiQLvcCYK1bfb.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;441&quot; height=&quot;297 &quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/vMJ3G8t4amWuAREHAtZnY6sTReZXiQLvcCYK1bfb.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256488&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: # 999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Students are reading beside the bookshelf at the entrance of the classroom.

She is recovering well now.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When some children first arrived, they were arrogant and said, &quot;Thinking that everything is other people&#39;s.&quot; It’s their fault. They often feel excluded and isolated from the entire world, and tend to avoid social interactions.” Some of these students may have already constructed or are forming their own worldview and set of behavioral logic. They are like big rocks on the cliff, shining brightly, but also easy to fall, and need the support of the big trees on the cliff. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tian Lan is one of them. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hearing that I wanted to chat with him in the military training class, Tian Lam’s eyes lit up as he shuffled slowly: “YES!” Later I learned that as long as there was no class, he would secretly happy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Entering the large conference room on the first floor, only the two of us were left. Tian Lan sat down in an almost &quot;Ge You lying&quot; posture without any restraint. When faced with many questions, he would pause for five or six seconds before slowly spitting out his answer. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When the topic involved emotions and &quot;depression&quot;, he seemed to be waking up from a dream, &quot;Then why are you looking for me -&quot; I thought the conversation was about to reach a deadlock, but he said again: &quot; This needs to be traced back all the way...even though I am only 14 years old, it has already run through my short life.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tian Lan grew up in a provincial capital city in the south of the Yangtze River. A year or two before coming to the &quot;Ugly Duckling&quot;, he dropped out of school for six months and was bored at home without ever leaving the house. Watching videos and reading novels. The longest time I stayed awake was more than fifty hours. He originally weighed 140 pounds, but lost dozens of pounds because he only had one meal in a day or two. &quot;It&#39;s not nutritious. Even my nails are only cut once a month.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Unbeknownst to him, he refused to hear any sound at that time. He would explode whenever he heard a sound and would not let his father live at home. &quot;I just drove him away. They say &#39;filial piety comes first&#39;, but I actually beat my parents. I couldn&#39;t help it. After the beating, my mother cried, and I cried with her.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A psychiatrist was also found. Yes, come to see a doctor. Tian Lan didn&#39;t accept any of it. &quot;The questions they asked were very boring, and I couldn&#39;t see anything credible from them.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Day and night are reversed, lifeless. At that time, Tian Lan&#39;s only thought was &quot;stay at home until the age of 18 and then die.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What happened before that? I asked him several times.他蹙着眉陷入回忆，“我也说不清。”从幼年到初中的时光，在记忆拼图里，满是裂缝。对过往的描述里，夹杂着认可、怨愤、反思，和更多的迷惑。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;田榄的爸爸是国企中层干部，妈妈全职照料他。和他们的关系谈不上多差，也谈不上多好。 10岁上下，钢琴老师因为他练琴出错，骂得很凶，“还把牛奶摔出去”，他考完钢琴十级，“再也不想碰这东西。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;刚念初一，他在省城一所颇有名气的外国语学校，同学们好像都比自己厉害。 “当时全年级就9个班，我在2109班。但他们说我是10班的。大家都玩得起来，除了我。我怀疑我脑子神经有问题，为什么别人可以社交，我不行？”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;田榄渴望有一个朋友，结果却为零。后来他不想再做作业。 “我妈说你爱做不做。”他有一个月没去上学。人，彻底蔫儿了。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;辍学半年后，他进入了当地一所军事化管理的“封闭学校”（&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;特训学校&lt;/span>;）。 “对，就是××书院那种。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“管得严并不重要，我讨厌黑社会。”他强调。在田榄的形容里，那所学校很撮（&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;二声，意为骗人&lt;/span>;），“教官、小混混都仗势欺人，想打什么打什么。男生班不把人当人。到处都有监控，就为了家长能看到。连集合的时候擦个鼻涕，都能被拉到楼梯间。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;刚到封闭学校时，因为在家“宅”得太久，肢体功能有点退化：手指没力，眼没法聚焦。军事课没上几节，他就听到膝盖那儿“咔”的两声，人栽倒在操场。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;就这样过了五天，教官和同学都以为他是装的。 “去村医院照片子，我是膝盖那儿骨折，医生给我照的小腿！”他一副“匪夷所思”的表情。复诊时去看医生，送医的车旁好些老师，却没有一个人帮他拉轮椅，推他上车。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“整个世界病态。我也是病态的。”他习惯性地撇嘴一笑。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;怎么能在那样的环境里待了8个月？ &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“我后来也就学会了忍啊。刚来没多久，跟我爸诉苦，求他带我走。他也就笑笑。可你知道吗，在封闭学校待久了，我甚至觉得有点温馨！找到了一点家的感觉。”对这种心态，他自己都难以置信。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在封闭学校前后，他陆续在另外几所学校上过学。田榄惊诧于“不过一年多，怎么世界变得奇卷无比”：“有的学校恨不得小升初就把初中内容都学了。有的连上厕所时间都不够，搞不懂。考试前每一天都讲试卷。我妈不是告诉新学校的老师我曾经骨折过吗？封闭学校留下的手上这个冻疮脓包，过一年都没消。老师问，你不是骨折吗，都在家休息，你怎么还会有冻疮？”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这颗心，也并非死灰一片。田榄最想去学的是围棋。他最好的成绩是业余五段：不夸张地说，99%的普通人在围棋上已经不是他的对手。 “六段就不用想了，得省市比赛前三。我想我是有点天赋的。但考上又有什么用呢？”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/yb5knYK1H5M5xPYAGDUsjuZwJWyvrG62KRQXEuVY.jpg&quot;

&lt;p>;歪着头的他，又一次陷入神游中。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;所有人里，比他大五个月的表哥对他影响最深。舅舅、舅妈对表哥管得严，但新冠疫情期间，哥俩还是在老家的乡野里痛快了一把。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“老家房子大，后面有山。山头削一半，山崖上突出一块土坡，我们砍掉杂草，修了台阶，挖了很多坑洞，长了草以后，我们自己修个厕所，把它叫&#39;土地庙&#39;，哈哈。那就是我们的&#39;百花园&#39;。”聊天的两个小时里，他头一次咧开嘴。 “后山有个很大的塘，我们用大网捕鱼，好多虾蟹。塘那边小路上去，有很多花草树木，好玩。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但最近一次见到表哥，他眼中的对方“长很大了”，变了声，有些生疏，“不会一起玩了。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;李桂红觉得，田榄对人和世界的认知有偏狭之处，“但他是个很有正义感的孩子，眼里揉不得一点沙子。所以他会对环境有他自己的期待和要求。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这也是为何，田榄会觉得，比其他地方已经好太多的“丑小鸭”，也会有他看不惯的“小团体”“以强欺弱”的情况。副校长向国跃和生活老师龙成通（&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;“龙哥”&lt;/span>;）都不否认，个性顽劣、带着点江湖习气的孩子，在“丑小鸭”的确会有。 “我们会观察、处理，也会让每个孩子正视自己的问题。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“老李说我情感和情绪表达有问题。我也觉得自己有些迷迷糊糊的。正所谓，有过，才会更觉……宝贵？我形容不出来。”田榄长叹一口气。 “反正我觉得我这辈子不值，希望重新来一遍。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/471J7UgFwzxkHKyWZMNg9esZ9twVNQJ4swH9nKtU.jpg&quot;

&lt;p>;对这个标签化的词语，“丑小鸭”创始人詹大年并不领受。在他眼里，每一个孩子都没有多大的问题，他们只是无法适应传统教育的教学方式和评价标准，和家人、老师、同伴相处遇到了各种障碍。 “我甚至觉得，在ChatGPT的时代，这些所谓的&#39;问题孩子&#39;更有创造性，更有希望。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;1981年，湖南益阳人詹大年从师范院校毕业，26岁那年成为了桃江县最年轻的校长。在他任内，那所原来仅有一百多名学生的乡村学校扩张为拥有一千多名学生的中型学校。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但在体制内工作近20年后，詹大年决定辞职。此后他来到云南，先后参与创办两所民办学校，直到2011年，和妻子杨柳芳及几位同道一起创立了丑小鸭中学，并将之作为余生志愿。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“我离开体制和勇气无关，关乎个人选择。”他一再强调。 “我们的教育环境太注重&#39;择优赶差&#39;，孩子一旦成绩不好便好像了无前途。教育的价值是发展人呀，怎么变成了淘汰人呢？我想给自己和那些不被重视与关爱的孩子们找一条生路。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;詹大年的普通话带着浓重的益阳口音，他曾笑说“语音软件没法识别”。但就是这个脸如弥勒、肚腩微挺的男人，成了创新教育里一个拥有强大感召力的行动者。经年累月里，他趟出一条看似“偏门”、实则“渡人”、却又极难模仿的路。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在“丑小鸭”，学生一般入学时间短则5个月，最长两年多，会学习初一到初三的课程。詹大年希望，他们在这里学10个月左右，行为习惯能够回归正常，能正常处理好人际关系，然后就劝他们回原籍原校。 “毕竟回到父母身边读书，要方便一些。它的任务首先不是让孩子考上高中，而是正常地生活，甚至活下来。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;建校那年，詹大年的好友、云南省政协文史委副主任汪叶菊给学校取名“丑小鸭”，很多人不能理解，有的新生也觉得“好土”，詹大年却如获至宝：“小鸭可能会被人吃掉，丑小鸭有一天一定能飞起来！”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;所谓的“问题孩子”，很多都伴随着社交和心理的问题。但在最初一些年里，詹大年和同事们并未发觉和意识到问题的严重。直到2021年，学校内部的一次心理测评，九十多名在校学生里，有71名被评定为“重度抑郁”。他开始认真地审视这一问题，并多次在私人公众号和其他场合发声。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“我想让更多人了解青少年抑郁，抑郁是可以治疗的。但我们更应该去了解孩子的心声。他们不应该被边缘化。”来宜良前，他在电话里郑重地告诉我。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;出行前，我曾拜托他先分享几个抑郁学生的“案例”。他笑了笑，“讲谁合适呢？还是你来后随意和孩子们交谈吧。他们每个人的经历都可以书写百万字的小说。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;深秋的季节，从昆明出发不到一个小时车程后进入宜良县，沿南盘江逆流而上，经过一路的三角梅和灌木丛，鼻间开始弥漫着鸡鸭屎的“香味”和满村烧秸秆的烟气。岔路口立着一块“丑小鸭中学”的路牌指向目的地的方向。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;丑小鸭的原址就坐落在宜良北古城镇，交通便利。但因校舍年久失修，两年多前，詹大年带领大家将学校迁到了海拔1800多米的新址。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;步入教学楼，一层走廊的木质栏窗、书柜和满墙斜挂着的吉他映入眼帘。木头取自本地的杉树，木材不贵，却挺拔好看。 “都是孩子们跟我们一起建造的。”詹大年介绍。窗外的樟树、天竺葵，窗台上的珊瑚樱、观音莲、绿公主、铂金蔓绿绒，一盆盆层层叠叠的绿，甚为喜人。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;看似普通，却有着全中国多数学校望尘莫及的“优越”条件：年均2100多小时的日照。 10月份的白天，背对太阳不过几分钟便觉微热。来此参观的教育界人士朱小毛没忍住，拿着三本书作枕头，直接躺在了操场的地上。 “不躺都是一种浪费。一所有阳光的学校，才能真正温暖人心。”朱小毛慨叹。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/q3ntqxMMAWsWkelyuY6CHwcPdvtJ1WtIcSCfdPUa.jpg&quot;

&lt;p>;走廊上的钢琴，学生们下课可随意弹奏。教室集中在二层，一共只有七、八、九年级共三间，每间都很开阔：前半部分是课堂，后半部被书架做成的玄关隔开，只放了一两排桌子，供学生讨论、活动。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;除了校长夫妇、创校不久便来的向国跃、李桂红和“龙哥”，老师们都很年轻，好几次我都把老师错当成了学生交谈。 “在这儿看不到多少老师的痕迹。没有校服，也没有制服。”詹大年说。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但教室墙面上用水笔书写的课表上，却活脱脱全是“老师”的存在：娟娟、波波、自富——教授者的昵称取代了课程名。黑板也被几乎整面墙的白板代替，顺滑，超大。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“丑小鸭”倡导全科教学。这里的文化课只有三门：文科、理科和英语。文科老师负责语文、历史、政治三科教学；理科老师负责数理化三科。 “大多数来的孩子，就是自信被伤害，关系被破坏，甚至人格被解体。如果科目老师一周只有一两节课的时间和学生接触，一个学期下来都没法熟悉学生，很难有我们期待的那种生命交融。只有尽可能多地接触孩子，才能够建立教育应有的&#39;关系&#39;。”詹大年解释。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;初二的语文课上，有同学提问，“娟娟，今天我们能开&#39;小火车&#39;吗？”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“可以啊！”接下来，学生们一个个次第起立，如多米诺一般，每人朗读完一句刚学过的古文《与朱元思书》便自行翻译，下一个亦复如是——这是大家乐此不疲的游戏。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“嘿，你怎么抢断别人车厢？”娟娟嗤的一笑，却并无责怪。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“那个谁，你今天刚到是吧？”她对一位坐在最后排、有些扭捏的新生讲，“我们有&#39;新生保护期&#39;，这个问题你可以不回答。期待你后面的表现哦。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在“丑小鸭”，学生几乎每节文化课都会用平板电脑查资料，接着再交还老师；下课后，可以用教室的触摸屏欣赏音乐、看看短视频；一周还有一两天晚上有自由上网的“福利”——当然，还是平板。手机，除非请假回家探亲，平时严禁使用。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“网瘾大，不用手机受不了？”似乎没人这么觉得。每天下午两节文化课后，学生除了参加军训，还有两节兴趣课和社团活动：吉他、舞蹈、声乐、篮球。不用固定，想上哪个都可以。实在没有感兴趣的，打牌、弹琴、看书，和人聊天，打打沙袋，在操场遛弯儿，都行。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;每个月的3日、13日和23日，是村里的“街天”（&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;赶集日&lt;/span>;）。生活老师会带着学生走出校门，出去赶集。 “什么豆浆油条，米饼、苦荞饼、葱油饼，饼干山楂卷，酸辣凤爪，百香果味道的，什么好吃的都有。”初二女生季果儿跟我描述着，馋虫仿佛已顺着嘴边冒了出来。 “有时周末，老师还会带我们去县城泡温泉，吃烧烤、火锅，还有露营。可好玩呢。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/87mzFhHs2aAVvAn0lrtqpq7ngfD3U1EC1lnciydw.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;538&quot; height=&quot;348&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/87mzFhHs2aAVvAn0lrtqpq7ngfD3U1EC1lnciydw.jpg&quot;

&lt;p>;“教育是急不得的。好的关系才是好的教育。”这是詹大年在教育圈里最广为人知的一句“箴言”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一位曾就读于“丑小鸭”的学生这么形容他心目中的“詹式治校”：“我看你也没有什么别的招数呀，就是对那些容易惹祸的学生，先不惹他们；然后呢，让他们吃好喝好玩好，就行了。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;詹大年朗声大笑，“你看得很准啊。就是这样。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;以前，每每听到詹大年强调“理解”、“信任”、“关系就是一切”，讲求“科学管理”的教育专家李镇西总觉得“太玄乎”，现在他越来越明白了詹大年。 “教育不能仅仅规范行为，更应该关注心灵。&#39;丑小鸭&#39;是把孩子当人，着眼于每一个人的人格尊严、精神自由。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在成人眼中“有问题”的孩子，也会成为彼此心灵的照护者。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在“丑小鸭”，除了行政班和宿舍的生活班，每位新生还会被分配一名学长“师傅”，帮他们熟悉校园生活，克服生活中的负面情绪。有的孩子刚来时不吃饭、不洗漱、不洗衣服，说什么都不听。 “师傅”会带他们到心理室，但老李小杨并不一定立马介入，而是由学长陪其玩游戏，“有的学生是游戏高手，有的老师打游戏也很厉害，我们就给他介绍，他们可以聊很久。喜欢追番的，喜欢二次元和漫画的，喜欢唱歌、玩乐器的，都会慢慢凑到一起……”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/Sqc4Q0JTj4fIrtsrkp9D6kpi2OdyCkXc8K3mkGpV.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;538&quot; height=&quot;348&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/Sqc4Q0JTj4fIrtsrkp9D6kpi2OdyCkXc8K3mkGpV.jpg&quot;

&lt;p>;“丑小鸭”一度最红火的学生社团是心理社。 2014年8月3日，云南昭通发生地震。震后第二天，詹大年带领几个孩子驱车三百余公里，把救灾物资送到受灾村民手中。但他发现，灾区儿童的心理亟需干预和辅导，这恰恰是“丑小鸭”学生们可以着力的地方。很快，对心理辅导完全陌生的学生们查阅地震资料，请教心理老师：怎样帮助灾区哭泣和绝望的孩子？第二次进灾区，一群不到15岁的半大孩子，被一群更小的孩子唤作“老师”，一起做游戏，聊家常，带给了他们难得的欢笑。 “对我们的孩子，这也是一次极好的自我教育。”詹大年甚是欣慰。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;采访中，几位师生都向我提起一个叫罗亭的“学霸”男孩。 “有国外生活经历，家境好，人也帅，可一点都不显摆。”来丑小鸭之前，罗亭先后就读于上海一所国际学校和公立学校，因为对学校教学的不适应和疫情长期居家，最后干脆不去学校。每天大门不出，一言不发，把从小看着他长大的爷爷给愁坏了。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;到了千里之外的“丑小鸭”，他觉出这学校“挺不一样”，却也没有“一见倾心”。头一两个月，罗亭到哪儿都埋头做题，不与任何人说话。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;不知从哪天开始，他弹起走廊里那架珠江钢琴，像变了个人。 “小学二年级的时候学过半年，已经荒了四五年，相当于从头开始自学。”他不求速成，一首《卡农》和《花之舞》，照着搜到的曲谱来回弹上一学期，同学不时凑过来听，他也安然继续。 “那种愉悦，很难用言语表达。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;后来，罗亭和趣味相投的之寒、嘉渝成了死党。他们会凑在一起谈论中美贸易、俄乌冲突。初三下学期，几个人成立了学习小组，纷纷利用宝贵的“军训课免修”时间自习备考。 “在&#39;丑小鸭&#39;，我还喜欢上了跑步。”罗亭微笑着说。 “之寒原本体重超过100公斤，跑步以后，他瘦了40公斤，成了学校的传奇！”之寒的“励志跑”把罗亭也带成了跑步达人。学校的跑道接近125米一圈，他们每天跑上40圈，几乎“雷打不动”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;季果儿是个大大咧咧、“外粗内细”的女生。聊天时，她时不时地将视线转开，最后终于指着篮球架边一个人影，“小邓老师，我有个闺蜜在那边，她也好想和你聊聊。”于是，我和季果儿、她的闺蜜何蔓，手挽着手绕着操场走了一圈又一圈。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;季果儿说，何蔓有阵儿爱哭，她也不问那么多，就逗她笑。 “我跟她说，你哭起来可丑。她说你真讨厌。哈哈，这招儿管用。”季果儿笑得没心没肺。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“那对有些不爱说话的同学呢？”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“我们都在一个生活班，住在一个屋檐下，再不爱说话的人，久了都会说些各自的小秘密。你要是天天跟她念叨，她自然会来找你。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;她掰着指头和我说起同学的好：晓星老大方，不记仇；景雯喜欢看书、弹钢琴；何蔓开朗，性格好……&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“你刚说她爱哭？”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“嘿，她一看到我哭，又把自己眼泪憋回去，把我安慰好。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我们乐成一团。她却严肃起来：“其实像我们这么大的人都好面子，不希望显得弱，希望自己强。那得让他们（&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;同学&lt;/span>;）慢慢接受这个世界。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;看起来做事积极、待人周到、能指出他人问题的季果儿，在老师们眼中也会出言不逊，容易失去表达的边界。向国跃说，青春期的孩子常会表现出刺猬的特征。 “丑小鸭”的学生在原来学校和家庭里个人意志可能被强压着，到了这里就会反应出来。从2011年便加入学校的李桂红，原来也觉得孩子们“不守规矩”，总会用一些类似恶作剧的方式宣告他们的存在。 “詹校说，对孩子们要用放大镜看优点、老花镜看缺点。于是我也学会了欣赏他们。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“在&#39;丑小鸭&#39;，爱说话就让你接待新同学，会钢琴就尽可能地给机会弹；文章写得好会被张贴。我们有位C诗人，写了一篇关于爱情，一篇谈人生的，大家都可崇拜他了……不管是文艺演出还是演讲比赛，学校要求每个人都得上场，打酱油也要上台，演成什么样都给你鼓掌呵呵。”季果儿的话像袋子打开口的豆子，倾泻而出。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“对，还有小英。”从警校毕业的生活老师龙金英刚满二十，一头长发挡不住浑身的英气。采访那几天，她不是在拾掇买来的盆栽，就是拿着锯子锯木条、垒花架。 “小英太厉害了。生病帮你配药，装修、刷墙，火把节跳傣族舞，全能！她对情绪爆发的孩子很有一套，会让你出去走走。等冷静下来，再和你聊。”季果儿与何蔓心目中的小英，俨然已是女生们共同的“偶像”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/FXAdGQ7EL1u9qNNPEzEj4kyufjey5KUhzOnecwsB.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;546&quot; height=&quot;364&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/FXAdGQ7EL1u9qNNPEzEj4kyufjey5KUhzOnecwsB.jpg&quot;

&lt;p>;但能干如小英、向国跃，也有不太使得上劲的时候。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“像朴朴和田榄，他们的父母虽然也和他们发生过争执，但总体还是能平复下来，接受孩子当下的状态，与学校配合。”向国跃指出，最难办的是，有的家长把孩子送过来，是希望“你按照他们的方式来教育孩子，只关心成绩，不关心背后是什么”；或者意识不到自己的问题，很难沟通；更有甚者，对孩子几乎不闻不问。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“孩子心里缺爱，父母却很少回应，甚至带给他们一次次的伤害。于是亲子之间彼此伤害。有的孩子还会被迫卷入成年人的关系之中，学会了暴力、疏离和冷漠。”李桂红说。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;有感于亲情教育的重要，詹大年从办学不久便开设了家长课堂。他的私人公号长年以一天两条消息的频率持续传播教育理念。许多家长在孩子抑郁、厌学、和父母停止交流后，从詹大年的公号上获得精神力量。有的，则直接将孩子送来这里。但转变却非朝夕之功。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;大脸庞、眸子明亮的何蔓，生长在中越边境的H城。她对童年印象最深的画面便是，爸爸骑着摩托车带她上学，妈妈晚上忙于美容院的生意，白天在睡觉。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;四年级转学到Q城，爸爸没时间照看她，便找了她原来的数学老师，花钱请她跨城过来做“保姆+辅导老师”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;从六年级到初二，何蔓辗转换了五六次学校。 “当时我当啦啦操副队长，跑步也跑第一。高年级的男生加我微信和QQ，同年级女生看我不爽，骂我绿茶。初二的学生威胁我交保护费，我只好拼命往后门跑，痞子挺多。老师说我学习不好，不让其他人跟我玩。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;她在墙角抽烟，被人举报。 “其实大家都抽，但他们只说我。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;她和爸爸哭诉，没用。 “没好好听我说。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“妈妈呢？”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“妈妈连我初一下学期学校在哪里、住哪里都不知道。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;她吞过二十来颗布洛芬，都是感冒时去学校医务室一点点存下的。 “跳楼也不行，都围着栏杆，没条件。就吃药了。活着真的没意义。妈妈跟老师说我鬼迷眼，故意吓他们。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;她再次从学校逃开。到底被爸妈逮住，在H城老家的地下车库关了一个晚上。 “用铁丝打我，扇我，掐我脖子，拉着我洗文身。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;她又回到Q城。去手机店上班，又被爸妈带回。 “他们只想抓我回去。我太多太多的人生，他们都没有参与。我只想逃脱。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;说到这儿，有个请了几天假的女生回到学校，何蔓看着大门口，露出一丝开心：“我们好多同学休假回来，常常带一大袋话梅薯片果冻、披萨给我们吃。有的会给生活班每个人都带杯奶茶，可美咯。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在“丑小鸭”，娟娟让她当班长；杨校让她接待来访客人；小英会安慰她，好好听她说话。刚来这里不久就赶上了夏令营，“从早到晚我们都在操场聊天，天黑了一起看电影、吃烧烤……”她原以为，到“丑小鸭”以后第一次给父母打电话自己会哭，结果竟然全程欢笑。 “我本来对前男友很执着，老李说，我其实对恋爱一窍不通。哈哈。不过我真的知道了，外面虚虚渺渺，我现在学会看人了。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;因为课程落下太多，15岁的她在“丑小鸭”重修初二。她不着急，慢慢地体恤起总是对她“恨铁不成钢”的爸爸。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;爷爷奶奶老家不在云南，过来几十年，在镇上还是不受待见。五十开外的爸爸，早年在H城做会计，在何蔓眼里其实是家族中最懂事的一个。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“他是家里最正经做事的，可小时候吃到一块糖都奢侈。他恨家里人，觉得不公平，什么烂摊子都是他去擦屁股。所以他希望我有出息，能留在身边。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;来“丑小鸭”前，何蔓曾去昆明看过心理医生。 “医生说，你们两代人之间隔阂太深。反正我好多事情，爸妈不问，我也不说。有时候我调皮，就是想故意气他们一下。”她顿了顿，语气柔和下来：“我爸有糖尿病，我现在不会再故意气他了。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;小野的故事里，则几乎只有她和母亲。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“今天是我来到丑小鸭的第136天。”刚坐下，她清晰地说出这个日子。每过一天，她都会在日历上划掉一杠——“感觉又离回家近了一天。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;和另外几个女生迫不及待的分享欲不同，小野的眼神和嘴角都带着一分打量。她擅长美术，最近学校的“班级文化”，从楼梯间到宿舍墙壁再到走廊的装饰画，她全有贡献；唱歌、跳舞，样样拿得出手。但好像这些还不够满足她的渴望。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“她经常自伤，拿尺子、石头，中性笔掰断，什么都用。手和腿抓得跟鱼鳞似的。”李桂红说，朴朴的自残更多是一种情绪宣泄，小野的行为里还多了一份“求得关注”的意图。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在小野的描述里，妈妈会觉得离婚是因为女儿的缘故，“所以老带着私人情绪怨怼我。”从很小起，妈妈越是不许她干什么，她就越来越想做。一吵架，两人总是拿出恶毒的语言互相指责，“她说我有妄想症。我说你也去看看，肯定你有问题。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;小野曾经很爱给妈妈写信，写微信，或者手写几百字的信，再拍照发给“老李”。 “其实是希望我转发给她妈妈。有的外省的父母可能来三四次了，她觉得妈妈怎么老不来。不来就是不爱我。要立刻实现才是爱我。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“等我们长大了，要把那些叛逆的家长送到一间叫&#39;丑老鸭&#39;的学校去，或者叫&#39;丑小鸡&#39;，哈哈！”说起和同学瞎聊时的提议，小野耸肩大笑。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;可妈妈知道她想买“洛丽塔”服饰，爱看漫展，都会全力支持。 “我不是个合格的女儿……对不起我妈。”小野眼眶有点泛红。她希望自己早点独立，能挣钱，“出去了给我妈打钱。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“亲爸？没见过，因为我是女孩就不要我了。他现在想见我？没可能。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;关于“丑小鸭”，她来之前查过这地方，学校名字怪怪的。 “过一种幸福完整的教育生活……”她喃喃念起引自教育家朱永新的这句“丑小鸭”校训，“能实现吗？”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;她拒绝上到初三毕业，希望早点离开，因为外头有好多好玩的等着她。在老家，她小学四五年级就跑去KTV，“那些加微信的姐姐都好漂亮。”她们称赞她“会唱歌跳舞，化妆也好，不会惹事”，还有大人教她“不要太在乎别人看法”这样的人生道理，她都觉得可长见识、可快活了。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;她希望老李和妈妈沟通，让她回去。但妈妈不放心，“在宜良能够切断她和老家的社会关系。”李桂红说，她曾婉转地提醒小野，社会上的人讲义气，但小恩小惠后面很可能有对未成年人的利用。 “这些道理她暂时还不太能听进去，但我们总得要一点一点和她讲。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/BYA0RMGelbZiZ46SxJFr4d0fM8KD2hJpXWFgFPnw.jpg&quot;

&lt;p>;一位詹大年的读者表示，自己从小学习顺利，一直就读本地最好的学校，但从来不快乐也没有成就感，三十好几还在迷茫；几位老师和家长带着孩子遇到的校园霸凌、心理疾病问题现场求助；还有几位来自不同学校的老师提出，想要去关怀学生，却势单力薄，“我们也是问题老师，谁来帮助我们？！”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“既说明大家有巨大的表达欲和想要解决问题的热忱，也说明，无论是教育工作者还是孩子家长，很多人本身也都存在着心理问题需要被看到，被疏导。”一位与会嘉宾感叹。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2021年6月修订实施的《未成年人保护法》明确规定：教育行政部门应当加强未成年人的心理健康教育，建立未成年人心理问题的早期发现和及时干预机制。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但在论坛内外，大家讨论更多的，是那些引发抑郁或者因抑郁导致的现实生活中的问题。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;著名教育专家冯恩洪指出，构筑青少年心理安全教育防线所面对的，是当今社会在教育问题上的全体性迷失。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;陈瑜是家庭教育平台“少年大不同”创始人，曾深度访谈过上百个抑郁、厌学、挣扎绝望的中小学生。今年找她当面和电话咨询的学生里，数量激增的是高一新生。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“有的孩子上高一第一天，做作业到夜里11点。老师说，你都上高中了，还指望睡好觉吗？有北京&#39;六小强&#39;（&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;海淀名校&lt;/span>;）的学生问我，我为什么需要学到滴水不漏、一字不差的程度？这是很多孩子的困惑。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;有学生告诉陈瑜，开学第一天，学校里做如是动员：“拥有成绩，就拥有一切。坐在你身边的同学，都是中考考场的敌人。”她遇到一位深圳名校的女生，凌晨4点起来读书，渐渐地例假也不来了。她问女孩，“一切都要为分数让道吗？成绩比身体还重要吗？”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“女孩说，是的。&#39;这样也好，我再不用担心考试撞上生理期了。&#39;还有辽宁一位排名年级第一的孩子觉得自己&#39;像窃取了皇帝桂冠的窃贼&#39;，好像坐在高台上，一阵风吹来，就会倒掉。”陈瑜总结，这一代的孩子，厌学更早，休学更长，复学更难。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“如果孩子视力下降、睡眠不足、体质羸弱、心理畸形，乃至生命夭折，所有教育的辉煌成就都毫无意义！”李镇西在他的演讲中疾呼。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当学生有抑郁倾向或被确诊，会遭遇截然不同的境遇。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;陈瑜访谈过的一个孩子，确诊抑郁症之后被同学排挤，课桌里塞满了垃圾和矿泉水瓶。后来新的班主任约她出来在咖啡馆聊，复学的时候，她牵着小姑娘的手走进学校，到班级门口的时候，全班同学鼓掌欢迎她，孩子心理发生了剧变。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但在江浙某地，有学校给临近高三的学生做了心理测评和评估，“校方对其中一些孩子说，你目前的情绪状态没有办法适应学校接下来的学业。就把他们退学了。很多抑郁症的孩子也会说，我回到家里以后就没有任何的老师和学生来联系我。他觉得我从此被这个组织抛弃了。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;解决之道在哪里？ &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;教育家杨东平的回答是，教育部门不断推出“减负”新政，然而如何摆脱教育方针与教育现实长期两张皮、素质教育缺乏生命力的状态？答案只有一个：中国需要新的教育哲学，要从头做起自上而下的顶层设计。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;他进一步提出：要从源头上减少课程教学时数，降低教学浓度、考试难度，推行小学的全科教师模式，改善教育生态；取消重点学校，试点学科分层，有利于学生之间的交流，减少因教育分流制度而造成的贴标签或受歧视的现象。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“当你把孩子当作一个人来尊重，跟他相处，你就会得到一个正常健康的人；如果你把孩子当作学习机器，那你得到的就是一个物件。”杨东平的掷地有声和詹大年的朴素语言都引起了听众的强烈共鸣。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;来丑小鸭中学参观和阅读詹大年公号的读者感受到，“问题孩子”在这里找回了自己，也认识了生活，他们可以重新起航。 “那么，一所普通学校能办成&#39;丑小鸭&#39;吗？假如对正常的孩子也是以这种方式教育会怎样？”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;然而詹大年一直强调，丑小鸭中学是一种预防型的学校，是为不适应传统教育体制的孩子提供适合的教育方式，而非提供一种解困的方法论。 “我们今天碰到的所有教育症结，都不是一个论坛能改变的。但它能提供一种思考：我们的教学，我们的家庭教育，是不是出了什么问题？这就是这些探讨和发声能起到的作用。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在人前似乎“难不倒”的詹大年，坦承他面对抑郁和其他表现的孩子常有束手无策的时刻。曾经有一个父母分开的混血女生，一根脚趾被自己用皮筋缠到坏死，来了“丑小鸭”又想缠另一根。来了好几个月依然头也不抬，进展缓慢。 “这孩子后来我们只好劝退了，因为已经超出了我们的能力范围，需要医疗机构的干预。”詹大年的语调里有一种少见的失落与无力。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我问陈瑜，假如学校环境很难改变，有的父母又像嘉宾们说的“冥顽不灵”，她会给访谈的那些孩子怎样的建议？ &lt;/p>;

&lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Razor clams are a popular and affordable seafood. In order to increase the production of razor clams, some fishermen illegally use pesticides on the tidal flats to kill and drive away the natural enemies of razor clams on the tidal flats. Visual China|Picture&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Liu Ming is still waiting for an explanation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;A few months ago, many of the aquatic products in his fish pond suddenly died overnight, causing heavy losses. His fish pond is close to the seaside. Every time the tide rises on the first and fifteenth day of the lunar month, seawater is introduced into the pond to change the water. Three other farmer neighbors also suffered losses. They all changed the water on July 2, 2023 - the fifteenth day of the fifth lunar month. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Not only fish pond farmers such as Liu Ming are asking for gifts from the sea, but there are also razor clam (commonly known as &quot;razor clam&quot;) farmers in the tidal flats one or two kilometers away. Liu Ming and others suspected that razor clam farmers put pesticides on the tidal flats, forming &quot;poisonous water&quot; after high tide. They were introduced into the fish ponds just in time for the water change, poisoning the aquatic products. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Liu Ming said that they have reported the case and there is no investigation result yet. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Different organisms have different constitutions. As long as the appropriate dosage is mastered, pesticides can kill and drive away the natural enemies of razor clams on the tidal flats without affecting the razor clams. Huang Biaowu, a senior experimentalist at the School of Marine Biology of Xiamen Marine Vocational and Technical College who has long studied razor clam cultivation, told Southern Weekend reporters that the method of raising razor clams using pesticides on tidal flats currently exists in some coastal areas of my country. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The most common of these pesticides is triazophos, which is mainly used to control pests in fruit trees, cotton, and food crops. However, it is illegal to use it in razor clam cultivation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The use of pesticides has increased the survival rate of a single razor clam species, but at the expense of biodiversity. The tidal flats are a transit point for millions of migratory birds around the world, and abundant shellfish are their food. At present, the residues, metabolic patterns and effects of pesticides on human health in razor clams have not been fully studied. Due to the difficulty of supervision and other reasons, this farming method has not been effectively managed in some coastal areas. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Kill natural enemies without poisoning razor clams&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Razor clams are a popular affordable seafood. Huang Biaowu told Southern Weekend reporters that there are currently many kinds of razor clams on the market. The razor clams sold are basically aquaculture products, and there are two main methods: pond culture and tidal flat culture. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Early cultured razor clam seedlings were derived from wild seedlings, and wild razor clam seedlings were only produced in Zhejiang and Fujian, with limited quantities. More than ten years ago, after a breakthrough in artificial razor clam breeding technology, large-scale tidal flat farming methods emerged. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img img-id=&quot;73272&quot; group-id=&quot;0&quot; asset-id=&quot;70088&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/d678c245b9.jpg&quot; img-title=&quot;Razor Clam 2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width= &quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;725&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/d678c245b9.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256461&quot; style=&quot;&quot;>;&lt; /p>; &lt;p>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot; >;March 2022, Quanzhou, Fujian. In the morning, taking advantage of the lull in the tide, fishermen go to the tidal flats to salvage wild razor clam seedlings for sale. (Pictures and texts are unrelated) Visual China | Pictures&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;With the promotion of raising razor clams on tidal flats, beach clearing drugs such as triazophos have also become popular. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The rise and fall of the tide forms an intertidal zone thousands of meters wide, which is a treasure trove of biodiversity. In addition to razor clams, algae, snails, Abundant organisms such as shrimps, crabs, and small fishes also attract birds to feed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Huang Biaowu explained that when the razor clam seedlings are first released, they cannot penetrate very deep into the soil and can easily become food for other organisms on the tidal flats. In severe cases, razor clam farmers may even lose the seeds. receive. Triazophos can kill crabs, snails, gobies and other natural enemies of razor clams. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;There are many considerations in how to use triazophos and other drugs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Li Cheng, who once raised razor clams on the tidal flats, told Southern Weekend reporters that the traffic problem must be solved first. In the vast tidal flats, there are tens of thousands of acres of razor clam farms as far as the eye can see. If you cannot move with your feet alone, you will immediately fall into the mud. To do this, razor clam farmers ride on a homemade scooter-like tool called a &quot;mud sled.&quot; It is a long wooden board with slightly warped ends and a handrail in the middle. The driver can kneel on the board with one leg and push on the ground with the other leg, so that he can slide quickly on the mudflat. Four hundred years ago, it was the &quot;secret weapon&quot; used by the Qi army to defeat Japanese pirates. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The dosage and area of ​​triazophos sprayed on the tidal flats need to be strictly controlled to achieve the purpose of killing natural enemies without poisoning razor clams. The razor clam breeding grounds are similar to field ridges, each about 150 meters wide, and the two stems are about 50 meters apart, making it easy for boating. The razor clam farmer tilts a 50-pound pesticide bucket behind the mud sled and moves forward in a straight line at a constant speed. The pesticide slowly flows out from the small eyes of the bucket, and it travels about 2 kilometers in an hour. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Li Cheng revealed that these triazophos were not purchased from the market. &quot;There are wholesalers who can directly contact them to deliver them to you.&quot; The time for spraying pesticides is usually before the spring tide. After the tide rises, the pesticides on the tidal flats will spread with the sea water. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;It was this &quot;hidden rule&quot; of farming that made Liu Ming and others suspect that the sudden loss of their fish pond after the water change was related to the use of pesticides to raise razor clams. This is not the first time similar incidents have occurred locally. Farmers have even summed up their experience. Before changing the water, they first ask the people at the beach if they find dead fish to judge whether the sea water is &quot;toxic&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Local razor clam seedlings are sown in March and harvested in March of the following year. Because when the weather gets colder, there are fewer natural enemies of razor clams near the shore, so the spraying time lasts from March to September, usually at most twice a month. &quot;The smell of triazophos is very pungent and very irritating.&quot; Li Cheng said that once he put triazophos in the car, and the unpleasant smell did not dissipate for several days. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;According to media reports, in 2018, Lao Wang, who had been raising razor clams for 18 years in Dafeng, Yancheng, Jiangsu, suddenly developed chest tightness, dizziness, and fatigue. Doctors found that the culprit was Lao Wang. The organophosphorus pesticide used by Wang can kill cockroaches (a small organism commonly known as &quot;sea leather&quot;) that destroy the growing environment of razor clams. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In addition to triazophos, Li Cheng also used two pesticides, dichlorvos and imidacloprid, which were also used to kill the natural enemies of razor clams, but triazophos was used in the largest amount. . &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Explicitly prohibited but difficult to supervise&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Pesticides such as triazophos, dichlorvos and imidacloprid are not used in aquaculture in compliance with regulations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;An expert in the field of aquatic products and fishery drugs said in an interview with a reporter from Southern Weekend that my country implements a white list system for aquaculture drugs. “The veterinary drugs for aquaculture in the white list have all undergone rigorous research on pharmacodynamics, toxicology, food safety and environmental impact, and have a relatively in-depth understanding of the effects of use and the rules of metabolic residues in aquatic products. Know.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Chemical drugs outside the white list are not allowed to be used illegally. Pesticides such as triazophos used by razor clam farmers are not on the white list. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;There have been some studies on triazophos. An article published in 2007 by experts from the Zhejiang Provincial Institute of Marine Fisheries and other institutions mentioned that triazophos used in the process of raising razor clams can remain in edible tissues. Experimental simulation data shows that triazophos is present in razor clams. The accumulation and elimination speed in the drug are both fast. 24 hours after the drug was administered, the concentration of triazophos in the body reached 2.97mg/kg, and after 100 hours, it dropped to 0.021mg/kg. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Currently, my country has only set limits for triazophos in plant foods, and there is no standard to follow in aquatic products. Referring to the &quot;National Food Safety Standard Maximum Residue Limits of Pesticides in Food&quot; (GB 2763-2021), the maximum limit is 0.2mg/kg for fruits, and the minimum limit is 0.05mg/kg for cereals such as wheat and oats. The 24-hour data of the above study seriously exceeded the standard, but the 100-hour data did not exceed the standard. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;However, because triazophos can easily cause excessive pesticide residues in vegetables, triazophos is not popular in vegetable planting. In 2013, the former Ministry of Rural Affairs stipulated that, Its use on vegetables is prohibited after December 31, 2016. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Some places have clearly banned the use of triazophos for raising razor clams. For example, in 2017, Yueqing City, Zhejiang Province, one of the main producing areas of wild razor clam seedlings, issued the &quot;Notice on Prohibiting the Use of Pesticides in Shallow Beach Breeding&quot;, which strictly prohibited the use of triazophos, dichlorvos, sodium pentachlorophenol, and cypermethrin in shallow beach breeding. , imidacloprid and other pesticides, and residents are encouraged to stop and report violations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;There are also cases of punishment. In 2017, law enforcement officers from the Ninghai County Fishery Administration and Fishing Port Supervision and Management Station in Ningbo, Zhejiang Province discovered that someone was using triazophos during the cultivation of razor clams and were fined 10,000 yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;However, it is very difficult to regulate the use of pesticides such as triazophos. Some coastal farmers told Southern Weekend reporters that this breeding method has been secretive for many years. To avoid public notice, razor clam farmers usually spray pesticides late at night. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;As early as 2014, Wang Songlin, chairman of the environmental organization &quot;Qingdao Marine Ecology Research Association&quot;, witnessed a group of razor clam farmers spreading triazophos on the tidal flats. The &quot;Razor Clam: China Offshore Breeding Assessment Report&quot; released by the Research Association in 2019 pointed out that the inconvenient transportation into the breeding tidal flat wetlands has brought many difficulties to supervision work. For example, people, vehicles, and ships cannot move forward on the muddy tidal flats, making it difficult for supervisors to locate evidence. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img img-id=&quot;73273&quot; group-id=&quot;0&quot; asset-id=&quot;70089&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23 /11/01/fb36a6570f.jpg&quot; img-title=&quot;Razor Clam 3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;718&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com /cms/medias/image/23/11/01/fb36a6570f.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256462&quot; style=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;br>;&lt; /p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In January 2023, farmers harvested razor clam seedlings in the tidal flat breeding area of ​​Yueqing Bay in Wenzhou, Zhejiang. (Pictures and texts are irrelevant) Visual China | Pictures&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Inertial thinking in farmland management&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Wang Songlin said that not only razor clams, but also some economical shellfish For example, the tidal flat cultivation of variegated clams and the large-scale sea cucumber cofferdam breeding industry along the Yellow and Bohai Seas also have illegal use of chemicals. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The &quot;Sea Cucumber: China Offshore Pond and Cofferdam Culture Assessment Report&quot; released by the Qingdao Marine Ecology Research Association in 2019 mentioned that the cofferdam culture of sea cucumbers is abused The chemical problem is more serious. For example, in order to prevent and treat diseases, antibiotics are used illegally in the nursery stage; pesticides and herbicides are illegally used in the breeding process to clear ponds and kill sea cucumbers&#39; natural enemies; excessive amounts of alum and illegal use of formaldehyde may also be used in the processing and sales of sea cucumbers. , causing the aluminum content and formaldehyde in sea cucumbers to exceed standards. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Raising razor clams on tidal flats not only destroys biodiversity through the use of pesticides, but also causes the death of birds by erecting anti-bird nets. A newly published study by Princeton University associate researcher Liang Dan and others found that during the peak spring migration period of migratory birds in April and May 2021, anti-bird nets erected for razor clam farming in Xinghua Bay, Fujian and Yueqing Bay, Zhejiang More than 13,000 shorebirds were trapped, many of which are nationally protected species. The research team also found similar anti-bird nets in 17 other locations in Zhejiang and Fujian. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Liang Dan told Southern Weekend reporters that the above-mentioned tidal flats in the above two places specialize in breeding razor clam seedlings. The razor clam seedlings usually sprout from around November and grow until March or March of the following year. It can be harvested in April. If these bird-proof nets are removed immediately after razor clam seedlings are harvested in March and April, tens of thousands of birds migrating in spring can be saved, and part of the bird-proof nets can also be prevented from entering the sea and harming marine life. However, because it requires high labor costs to dismantle the nets on the tidal flats, the farmers will keep the nets on the tidal flats after selling the razor clam seedlings, waiting until typhoons to sweep away the nets in June or July. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In their natural state, razor clams are only part of the biodiversity of Hamada Wetland. To carry out aquaculture on legally protected natural tidal wetlands, Wang Songlin believes that fishermen have to accept the high natural mortality rate of razor clams - being predated by natural enemies and competing with other benthic animals. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;But it’s hard. Whether it is razor clams or sea cucumbers, the use of banned chemicals such as organophosphorus and pyrethroid pesticides in the breeding process reflects the farmers&#39; inertial thinking: managing natural tidal flats and coastal zones as farmland, and treating aquaculture products as a single type of &quot; crop&quot;. &quot;I asked an old couple who came back from spraying pesticides. They were very enthusiastic and said frankly that the beach is no different from a cotton field. To ensure a high yield of razor clams, other fish, shrimps, crabs, and shellfish must be killed with pesticides, and long-billed waterfowl must be driven away.&quot; Wang Songlin said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;There is an old saying: &quot;April razor clams are plump and plump, so don&#39;t let Xishi&#39;s tongue down.&quot; April is the most plump season for razor clams, but it is not an eco-friendly time to eat them. . Because spring and autumn are also the peak seasons for migratory birds, reducing the interference from human activities such as spraying pesticides to clear the beach and firing cannons to drive away birds on natural tidal wetlands is of great significance to ecological protection. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;How to resolve these contradictions, Yueqing City, Zhejiang Province advocates the use of boat cultivators, quicklime, bleaching powder, drying and other methods to clear beaches and ponds. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Huang Biaowu suggested that farmers return to the old method of pond farming. For pond culture, eco-friendly quicklime and Chinese medicinal materials can be used instead of triazophos in clear ponds. Raising razor clams in ponds requires fertilizer and water, which is equivalent to fertilizing crops. Raising razor clams in ponds can also use the tail water discharged from other fish ponds as fertilizer water to purify the organic matter rich in nitrogen, phosphorus and other organic matter in the tail water, turning waste into treasure. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>;(Liu Ming and Li Cheng are pseudonyms)&lt;/span>; &lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 02 Nov 2023 16:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[俄罗斯铝业公司创始人奥列格·德里帕斯卡：没有特斯拉汽车，大家还是会活下去的]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259777]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-02 14:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;The Mandarin Oriental Hotel is located on Wangfujing Street in Beijing, overlooking the Forbidden City.

This company was listed in Hong Kong in 2015, becoming the first Russian company to be listed in China. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In April 2018, the United States imposed sanctions on Deripaska and 23 other Russian tycoons and officials, and he was included in the United States&#39; Specially Designated Nationals List (SDN). After entering this list, the Office of Foreign Assets Control under the U.S. Department of the Treasury will freeze its property and property interests within the jurisdiction of the United States.

Previously, Moscow State University held an international class. About twenty or thirty students from different countries came to Moscow State University to study mathematics and physics, and 30% of them were Chinese students. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Russian mathematics education is the best in the world, and we hope to promote such academic exchanges. At the same time, Chinese students can learn Russian, and Russian students can learn Chinese. We need to invest in transportation facilities and financial facilities, but we also need to invest in science education.

As long as there are no major conflicts in the next two or three years, ruble fluctuations will not be a big problem, because Russia&#39;s resource industry is still quite good. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;At the beginning of the year, you thought Russia needed to welcome more people from Investment from friendly countries, so what else can be done to promote cooperation between Chinese and Russian enterprises? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Oleg Deripaska:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;First, it takes time. The foundation of economic cooperation between the two countries is trust. We already have a foundation of trust. . Previously, 70% of Russian industry relied on European technology. Now it still takes time to transform, change our national standards, and cooperate with our friendly countries. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If you have a problem, you must solve it in time, and don&#39;t let it accumulate later. Entrepreneurs, including me, have raised this question before, why is Russia’s foreign trade so unbalanced? 80% comes from Europe and 20% comes from Asia. We need to find a balance. In the next two or three years, we will work hard to solve the problems that have not been solved before. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Second, we must invest in infrastructure, not just logistics facilities, but also financial platforms. The financial platform is not just a settlement issue. The two countries have learned how to settle in their own currencies, but the debt market has not yet achieved the results we want. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ten years ago, the Russian automobile industry began to talk about import substitution, but they did not start to do it until the problems had arisen. Five or 10 years ago, it was unimaginable that the United States would do this. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 混体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Have the sanctions imposed on you by the United States seriously affected your life?

Only trust between countries, only economic cooperation and mutually beneficial development between countries can solve these global problems. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Will Western sanctions make the sanctioned countries change their policies? Will not. Everyone would still be able to survive without Tesla cars. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the contrary, these sanctions will make us rethink our own development and fill some loopholes and shortcomings. For example, promoting the development of transportation and logistics, improving our financial market, and conducting settlement in local currency. We must build a new international security system and a new international relations system to avoid new crises. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The previous world was centered on the West, that is, all technologies and investments were initially determined by Western countries, which also led to many regional conflicts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 02 Nov 2023 14:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[不清楚孩子上了什么学，回家陪读三年仅是一次情感弥补？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259687]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-02 13:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Downstairs where I work, there is a circle of shops, including restaurants, small supermarkets, fruit and vegetable shops, and morning stalls. The shop... is surrounded by an industrial park, and there is only one commercial place around. It is very lively here during meals and commuting, and these shops are running well. I have been working here since the building was built, and most of these shops have been operating here since the beginning, so I know many of the merchants and often chat with them while shopping. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Three years ago, the proprietress of the Shaxian snack bar downstairs returned to Fujian to accompany her children in high school. Recently, I saw her when I was eating at a snack bar in Shaxian County, and asked, &quot;Are you back from studying with me?&quot; She said, &quot;Back!&quot; I asked again, &quot;Which university did your child go to after the college entrance examination?&quot; She scratched her head and answered. : &quot;I don&#39;t know!&quot; I asked: &quot;You have been studying with your child for three years, and you have achieved results after three years. You don&#39;t know what your results are?&quot; She still shook her head and said, &quot;I really don&#39;t know...anyway ...It seems to be from our side...&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Two days later, I went to the small supermarket nearby to buy something. The small supermarket was run by a couple, they were from Anhui, and the male owner I am explaining to the hostess, don’t forget to transfer living expenses to the child. I asked, &quot;Is your child going to college?&quot; They nodded and said they just went to college this year. I continued to ask: &quot;Which university does the child go to?&quot; The male host lowered his head and thought for a moment, and said, &quot;I can&#39;t remember either.&quot; I looked at the hostess, and she said, &quot;Don&#39;t ask me, I can&#39;t either.&quot; I know...&quot; the male host interjected, &quot;He said he was in Chengdu... studying design... or something else...&quot; I couldn&#39;t help but be dumbfounded and joked: &quot;You two don&#39;t know what&#39;s important! You two only know how to transfer it to your children. Living expenses!&quot; They both looked at each other, not understanding what I was laughing at. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Nowadays, most couples or one spouse works outside the home and the children study in their hometown. If one spouse works outside the home, the life of the spouse at home will focus on the child&#39;s studies and spend time accompanying them to school. Both husband and wife work outside the home, and many people choose to go back to study with their children at some important stages and moments, such as the third year of junior high school, the third year of high school, etc. This is all in the hope that by accompanying them to study, they can help their children learn so that they can get into the ideal school. However, when I heard that the proprietress of a snack bar in Shaxian County accompanied her child to high school for three years and did not know what university the child finally went to, I thought that the effectiveness of accompanying him to study is questionable. It should be about the same whether he studies with him or not. , the three years of accompanying her were probably just an emotional make-up. When I heard that the couple in the small supermarket did not know the school and major their children were studying in, I was thinking that this seemed to be someone else’s business. The essence of university education is to pay for living expenses with your head covered. It is an education that is at a loss. invest. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The day before yesterday, I called a water station downstairs and asked the store to send me a bucket of bottled water. The store responded that it could not be delivered, and there was no one in the store. The child was about to enter high school, and the wife went home to study with the child. If she wanted water, she would bring it herself. Originally, I could call another water station to have water delivered, but after the previous two experiences and my thinking, I immediately decided to go downstairs to carry water. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I went to the water station and asked the shopkeeper: &quot;Why does your wife want to go home to study with you?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Then everyone is accompanying you, so it&#39;s impossible for us not to accompany you!&quot; the shopkeeper replied . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;What else can I do when I go back to study with me?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;What else can I do, cook, wash clothes, supervise my children not to play with mobile phones...&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Like this Is it interesting to study with you?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The shop owner chuckled: &quot;We don&#39;t know about that... They say it&#39;s difficult to take the high school entrance examination now... I&#39;m afraid I won&#39;t be able to pass...&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I am not an educator myself , but I think there are some basic intellectual things that should be similar. I said to the shopkeeper, take the notes and I will tell you what time it is. I told him with my fingers: 1. Clarify your child&#39;s learning goals, which can be specific to which school he wants to attend, and understand the school&#39;s enrollment plan, enrollment requirements, and performance requirements. requirements and performance requirements as the program; 2. Maintain close contact with school teachers, understand the school’s learning progress and children’s learning situation, and solve possible learning problems in a timely manner. The basic problems should be grasped and the difficult problems should be overcome. ; 3. Your spouse should establish a good work and rest system, and supervise the child to balance work and rest during the learning process. When it is time to study and when it is time to rest, if you want the child not to play with mobile phones, first of all, she must not play with the mobile phone while the child is studying; 4. Don&#39;t use your emotional compensation as a moral standard to ask your children. Encourage your children to learn, but you must also respect your children&#39;s willingness to learn. 5. Caring for your children is long-term. It does not end when you enter high school in the future. Children are independent. However, your child&#39;s study and life are not independent. They are an expression of your family&#39;s common wishes and are closely related to your daily life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I finished speaking, and the shopkeeper also finished memorizing it, but he blinked, not knowing whether he understood or not. I told him that we would continue the discussion the next time I came to carry water. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Reading to your children is not just about doing laundry and cooking, nor is it as easy a job as sitting aside and playing with your mobile phone while asking your children to do homework and answer mock tests. What is the goal, what are the plans to achieve the goal, how to correct errors in the process of implementing the plan, how to achieve long-term emotional interaction after the plan is realized, how to make up for the failure of the plan, etc. These issues should be considered by the accompanying parents. of. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is a fruit and vegetable shop downstairs. The proprietress of the fruit and vegetable shop also came back from school soon. I asked her: &quot;How did my child do in the exam?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She replied: &quot;I passed the exam. But the school is not very good, and the child has to repeat the year.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I asked: &quot;Will you no longer accompany me during the repeat year?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She said: &quot;I won&#39;t accompany you anymore. , I’ve had enough company, it’s up to him how he does in the next year’s exam, let him go!”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It’s dinner time, people in the industrial park and people upstairs all come upstairs It&#39;s time to eat and consume, and the merchants are busy again. Looking at them being busy, I think about the children behind them who are still studying. I don’t know which universities, high schools or other places of study those children are in. I just hope that they will be healthy in body and mind and make progress every day. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(The author is a practitioner in Shanghai fruit industry)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot; >;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;(The &quot;hi, Southern Weekly&quot; column of Southern Weekend App is looking forward to your contributions.

The Chinese ancestors selected the &quot;beautiful stones&quot; from various stones. Jade is warm, shiny, meticulous and tough, so it is also considered by the Chinese to be benevolent and benevolent. Justice, wisdom, courage, and purity are the five moral qualities. Wearing jade has the effect of preventing evil spirits. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Chinese ancestors’ understanding of jade can be traced back to the Neolithic Age. Humans ground stone tools as tools for chopping and scraping, hunting, and cutting meat. Some ground stone tools showed a smooth and beautiful appearance, and humans began to have a preliminary understanding of jade. This also marks the beginning of the transition of human beings from material needs to spiritual needs. Archaeological research has found that in the late Neolithic Age, many jade products and jade ornaments appeared. At this time, the ancients had realized that jade and stone had completely different functions and aesthetics. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Around 3000 BC, jade craftsmanship was separated from stone tool processing technology and became an independent craft category. Based on the production traces left on the jades unearthed from the Hongshan Cultural Site and the Liangzhu Cultural Site, experts have inferred that a rotating jade processing tool - a weight machine - had appeared at that time. This is no different in principle from the jade processing machines we see now. The Shang and Zhou dynasties were the growth stage of Chinese jade art. The scope of use of jade expanded, and the number and types increased significantly. However, the shapes were still very simple, with only sporadic decorations. Hotan jade also appeared in this era for the first time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the Spring and Autumn Period and the Warring States Period, the art of jade carving developed. At that time, scholar-bureaucrats wore a series of jade ornaments all over their bodies. What reflected the spirit of the times at that time were a large number of jade pendants in the shapes of dragons, phoenixes and tigers, with complex and beautiful shapes and strong Chinese style and national characteristics. The jade pieces of the Tang Dynasty are all treasures. The craftsmanship was further developed and refined. The texture is warm and the luster is soft. Gold and jade complement each other, making them rich and elegant. In the Song Dynasty, jade gradually entered people&#39;s lives. Influenced by calligraphy and painting at that time, the style became more realistic and full of life. During the Ming and Qing Dynasties, jade art reached its peak, and various types of exquisite jade articles emerged in endlessly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The definition of real jade and non-real jade has long been reflected in the system of jade use in Chinese history. Hotan jade is the highest level of jade, it is real jade, and is used by emperors. After countless years, Hotan jade has just entered the folk world. The one that caused the controversy this time was Hetian jade. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Facing Wang Hai’s doubts, Yuanyang Jinlou, the owner of the cargo in Li Jiaqi’s live broadcast room, posted the appraisal certificates, including the National Jewelry and Jade Quality Supervision and Inspection Center (NGTC), Guangdong Gold and Silver Jewelry Testing Center Co., Ltd., National Gold and Silver Products Quality Inspection and Testing Center (Nanjing) Organization, Shenzhen Zhongdi Jewelry Testing Co., Ltd. These institutions are not without authority. So, what is the problem? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The first is the question of whether it is fake. According to Wang Hai, GB/T38821-2020 stipulates that the appraisal certificate must have total mass and physical photos, and consumers received 18 appraisal certificates attached to the necklace. Not only are each 40g, but they are also photos of a shared necklace. , then it is suspected of fraud. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, the problem of counterfeiting is easy to solve, but what is difficult to solve is the second level problem, which is the standard issue. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The standards used by these institutions are the national Hetian jade testing standards GB/T16552-2017 and GB/T16553-2017. This 2017 standard does not clearly stipulate the specific content of tremolite. As long as the main component is tremolite, it can be named &quot;Hetian Jade&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Hai adopts another standard, namely GB/T 38831-2020. The GB/T38821-2020 &quot;Hetian Jade Identification and Classification&quot; launched in 2020 was developed by the State Administration for Market Regulation and China Released by the National Standardization Administration Committee, it is the latest national standard for the Hetian jade industry. The mineral composition of Hetian jade is described as: &quot;Mainly composed of tremolite, the secondary mineral can be actinolite, and can contain a small amount of calcite, diopside, pyrite, pyrite, chromite, and magnetite. , quartz, serpentine, chlorite, epidote, wollastonite, apatite and garnet, etc.&quot; According to this standard, the naming rule is: when the percentage of other minerals in the same piece of jade is less than 5%, Hetian jade can be named directly. When the percentage of other minerals is more than 5% (except black jade), if the other minerals contained are evenly distributed and the boundaries of the mineral particles are clear, use &quot;tremolite jade&quot; with a note indicating that it contains other minerals. For example: tremolite jade (including tremolite jade) carbonates). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Then, things are clear. Both standards are used in the industry. The 2017 standard is more relaxed, while the 2020 standard is more stringent. However, this standard is not mandatory and is only a recommended standard. Jade sellers adopted the loose standards introduced in 2017, saying that their items were Hetian jade; while Wang Hai, who fights against counterfeiters, adopted a stricter standard in 2020, saying that the jade sold by Li Jiaqi was fake and did not meet the standards. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Objectively speaking, jade has been difficult to identify clearly since ancient times. What exactly is jade? In fact, many people don&#39;t understand. When we talk about what a thing is, it is actually a chemical question. Chemistry is the study of the composition of matter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From a chemical perspective, jade is actually a mixture. When we talk about gold, we refer to the material composed of gold atoms; when we talk about quartz, we refer to silicon dioxide; when we talk about ice, we refer to dihydrogen monoxide. Of course, minerals are mixed with other impurities, but in an abstract sense, these things are composed of single atoms or single compound molecules. But jade, in an abstract sense, is a mixture. For example, just like when we talk about Chinese medicinal soup and borscht soup, even in an abstract sense, it must be a mixture of multiple ingredients. Therefore, jade is a mixture, which is a mixture of two or more compounds and elements. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;With this concept, it is easier to understand jade. Jade has different chemical compositions, different colors, and different types. The chemical composition of jadeite is sodium aluminum silicate, the most representative of which is jadeite. The chemical composition of nephrite is hydrous calcium magnesium silicate, the most representative of which is Hetian jade. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Specifically, Hetian jade has four main mineral components: silicon, aluminum, iron and magnesium. Silicon accounts for a large proportion of Hetian jade, and its main forms are calcium silicate (CaSiO&lt;sub>;3&lt;/sub>;), magnesium silicate (MgSiO&lt;sub>;3&lt;/sub>;), and sodium disilicate (Na&lt; sub>;2&lt;/sub>;Si&lt;sub>;2&lt;/sub>;O&lt;sub>;5&lt;/sub>;), etc.; the aluminum element is mainly albite (NaAlSi&lt;sub>;3&lt;/sub>;O&lt;sub>; 8&lt;/sub>;), and also contains a small amount of aluminum silicate; iron mainly exists in the form of potassium ferroaluminate and iron silicate. It can be seen that Hetian jade has many ingredients. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The charm of jade, its appeal to people in terms of look and feel, stems from this characteristic of jade&#39;s chemical composition. This has also caused various confusions in the naming, identification, and even price of jade. Some people say that the wholesale price of jade sold by Li Jiaqi is only a few dozen yuan. But then again, the wholesale price of tens of thousands of jade in those tourist attractions and jewelry stores may only be a few hundred yuan or less. This is the characteristic of the jade industry. As the old saying goes, &quot;Gold has a price, jade is priceless.&quot; This does not mean that gold is not as valuable as jade, and jade is a priceless treasure. It means that the price of jade has been confusing and confusing since ancient times, and the profits are often abnormally high. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Jiaqi’s live broadcast room is said to have the lowest price on the entire Internet. Consumers believe it, but there is a gap between their expectations and reality. In fact, if you really want to buy cost-effective jade, the live broadcast room is not a good place.

Their purpose is to make them delicious and convenient, and more importantly, manufacturers can earn higher profits. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Excessively processed foods include soft drinks such as cola, bread, cakes, potato chips, pizza, biscuits, candies, burgers, instant noodles, ice cream, spicy sticks, etc. More and more research results show that the intake of overly processed foods may be harmful to human health and increase the risk of various diseases. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A recent study by Brazilian researchers suggests that overly processed foods may harm brain function. The reason is that overly processed foods contain many added and unhealthy ingredients such as sugar, salt, fat, artificial colors and preservatives. Past research has shown that overly processed foods are directly linked to an increased risk of heart disease, metabolic syndrome, and obesity, and now research is linking overly processed foods to a risk of decreased brain function. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The researchers collected data on nearly 11,000 men and women in Brazil with an average age of 52 who participated in the Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Adult Health. The researchers followed them for a long time, with a median follow-up time of 8 years. The results found that participants who consumed more than 20% of their daily calories from ultra-processed foods experienced a 28% faster decline in overall cognitive function and a 25% faster decline in executive function compared to adults over 59 years old. In other words, the decline in cognitive function and executive function is more obvious among adults aged 35-59. Overall, overall cognitive functions include learning ability and memory, while executive functions include language fluency and behavioral agility. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the researchers admit that they cannot yet explain the mechanism by which excessively processed foods lead to reduced brain function, and there is no neuroimaging to confirm their results. Therefore, future research is to explore which overly processed foods lead to cognitive decline in the body and the molecular mechanisms behind it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One possible explanation, however, is that when people regularly consume overly processed foods, they are less likely to get the fiber, microbes, minerals, and plants they need to stay healthy, fight off disease, and reduce inflammation. Nutrients. Ultimately, this may affect a person&#39;s brain function and functioning, as the brain requires a steady supply of these nutrients to function properly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Overly processed foods have also been linked to cancer. Researchers from Imperial College London have found that high intakes of ultra-processed foods may increase an individual&#39;s risk of developing cancer and dying from cancer. Previously, a large number of studies have revealed that consuming large amounts of overly processed food will increase the incidence of obesity, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. Now, British researchers have used the British Biobank to collect dietary information from 200,000 young people to study the relationship between body health and diet. This is the first such study to be conducted in the UK. The researchers monitored the people&#39;s health for 10 years, analyzing their risk of developing any cancer and 34 types of cancer, as well as the participants&#39; risk of dying from cancer. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Researchers conducted the most comprehensive assessment to date of the link between overly processed foods and people’s risk of developing cancer, including soda, industrially produced bread, and more. Ready-to-eat meals and most breakfast cereals. These foods often contain high levels of salt, sugar, fat, and artificial additives. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The results show that people who eat a lot of overly processed foods are at a greater risk of developing cancer. Overly processed foods are particularly related to ovarian cancer and brain cancer. They also increase an individual&#39;s risk of death from cancer, most obviously. of ovarian and breast cancer. For every 10% increase in a person&#39;s intake of overly processed foods in a person&#39;s diet, the overall risk of cancer increases by 2%, and the risk of ovarian cancer in particular increases by 19%. It is associated with a 6% increase in overall cancer mortality, a 16% increase in the risk of death from breast cancer, and a 30% increase in the risk of death from ovarian cancer. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The association between excessively processed food intake and cancer remained after adjusting for social, economic, behavioral and dietary factors such as smoking, physical activity and body mass index (BMI). Furthermore, previous research has shown that British adults and children consume the highest amounts of ultra-processed food in Europe. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although the study by British researchers cannot explain the causal relationship and mechanism between over-processed foods and cancer, they believe that existing research evidence shows that reducing the intake of over-processed foods in the daily diet may avoid Higher cancer rates. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Overly processed food has become widespread around the world and is addictive. A research report published in the British Medical Journal on October 9, 2023 by researchers from the United States, Brazil, and Spain pointed out that an analysis of 281 studies in 36 different countries found that 14% of adults and adults worldwide 12% of children are addicted to over-processed foods, and 1/7 adults and 1/8 children may be addicted to over-processed foods. These foods include ice cream, carbonated drinks and convenience foods, which can lead to cancer, obesity and Increased risk of heart disease. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, the consumption of ultra-processed foods is soaring around the world, and now more than half of the daily energy intake in the UK comes from ultra-processed foods. In the United States, ultra-processed foods account for 58% of Americans’ energy intake. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The fact that so many people eat over-processed foods suggests that they are addictive. Researchers explain the addiction to over-processed foods as higher levels of dopamine secretion may lead to over-processed foods. of addiction. Extracellular dopamine levels in the brain&#39;s striatum caused by refined carbohydrates or fats are similar to those of addictive substances such as nicotine and alcohol, thus creating a craving similar to alcoholism. Therefore, foods that contain high amounts of refined carbohydrates or added fats are likely to be addictive substances. The speed at which these overly processed foods deliver carbohydrates and fats to the intestines may also play a role in their addictive nature. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Symptoms of addiction to over-processed foods include: strong desire to eat, withdrawal symptoms, difficulty controlling food intake, and obesity, overeating, poor physical and mental health, and reduced quality of life. Despite this, he continued to eat without restraint. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;All of this suggests that the relationship between overly processed foods and health, as well as the addictive nature of such foods, should be further studied, and appropriate measures should be taken to protect people&#39;s health. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 02 Nov 2023 11:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[北京香山论坛：大国小国，平等对话]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259763]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-02 10:06:16&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&quot;&#39;Ten&#39; means maturity, perfection, harvest, and also indicates a new starting point and renewal.

Before the opening ceremony, Shaoyigu and Zhang Youxia walked into the main venue side by side and sat in the center of the first row. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Russia-China relations are exemplary and are increasingly attractive to other countries.” Shoigu mentioned, “The circle of friends between Russia and China who do not want to be involved in the Western confrontation agenda is constantly expanding.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As a country involved in the Russia-Ukraine conflict, Shoigu’s attendance attracted much attention. He mentioned that after Russia countered NATO&#39;s eastward expansion, the United States was using Ukraine to attack Russia. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Russia will only use nuclear weapons when it is attacked by a nuclear attack or when its national survival is threatened.&quot; Shoigu said in his speech. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is the second time that Shaoyigu has attended the Beijing Xiangshan Forum and delivered a keynote speech.

As the organizer, Zhao Xiaozhuo, deputy director of the Beijing Xiangshan Forum Secretariat, is extremely busy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At around 21:00 on the evening of October 29, when Southern Weekend reporters met Zhao Xiaozhuo, he had just finished the welcome dinner. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Recalling the first forum, Zhao Xiaozhuo still has fresh memories. &quot;At that time, most of the participants were scholars, and the total number of participants was only a few dozen, so it was very small.&quot; Zhao Xiaozhuo told Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Beijing Xiangshan Forum was founded in 2006 and is hosted by two think tanks from the Chinese military, the China Society of Military Science and the China Society for International Strategic Studies. In 2014, the forum was upgraded from track two (private) to track one and a half (semi-official, semi-private). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Since then, military and political leaders and national leaders will appear every year, and the conference has been adjusted from once every two years to once a year.&quot; Zhao Xiaozhuo said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Farewell to online meetings during the epidemic, the 10th Beijing Xiangshan Forum attracted official delegations from more than 90 countries and international organizations including Russia, the United States, Saudi Arabia, and Iran, with more than 1,800 participants. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past 9 forums, there have been as many as 6 forums with the theme of &quot;Asia-Pacific&quot;. With the major changes in the nature of the forum, the scope of topics has also expanded from Asia-Pacific affairs to global issues. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wu Xinbo, Dean of the Institute of International Studies at Fudan University, is a frequent visitor to the Beijing Xiangshan Forum. Since the first forum in 2006, he has attended the forum almost every year. He said, &quot;The theme of the forum is increasingly consistent with China&#39;s core concepts and basic principles of international security, and the topics of the sub-forums are also increasingly consistent with the current actual international security situation.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot; On October 30, the first plenary session of the 10th Beijing Xiangshan Forum.

(Photo by Lu Huiqian)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the evening of October 30, ten small closed-door seminars were held simultaneously, covering topics such as global security governance, artificial intelligence security, and Sino-US crisis management and control. &quot;It has never happened before that ten meetings can be held at the same time.&quot; Zhao Xiaozhuo said, &quot;It is up to the participating representatives to choose which forum they want to go to, who they want to talk to, and how much they want to talk.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Shi Chande, a researcher at the Institute for Defense Analyses and former deputy assistant secretary of defense, is an &quot;old friend&quot; of the Beijing Xiangshan Forum and a well-known &quot;China expert.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“I pay attention to China every day, and my understanding here may be deeper than that of the United States.” He told Southern Weekend reporters with a smile before the “Northeast Asian Order” sub-forum. The United States first sent official representatives to the Beijing Xiangshan Forum in 2015. Four years later, in 2019, then-U.S. Assistant Secretary of Defense Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Shi Chande led a team to attend the meeting. It was the first time that a current senior U.S. military official appeared. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“In the early days, the U.S. delegation’s participation in the Beijing Xiangshan Forum was relatively low, and basically only the military attache from the embassy in China was sent to participate.” Wu Xinbo recalled that as the importance and influence of the forum increased, the United States began to start from domestic Send some mid-level delegations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Similar to the Shangri-La Summit and the Munich Security Conference, an official’s rank determines his stage. This is a common international practice.” Zhao Xiaozhuo said, “After lower-level officials arrive, they are often only responsible for collecting information. Various opinions and information.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2018, the U.S. military delegation was led by Owen Lewis, dean of the Joint Forces Staff College of the U.S. National Defense University; previously, the president of the U.S. National Defense University also led a delegation to Beijing Xiangshan Forum. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This time, Carles, senior director for China affairs in the Office of the Deputy Secretary of Defense of the United States, took over the &quot;baton&quot; from the head of the delegation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;The levels of Carles and Shi Chande are similar, but in terms of specific ranking, Shi Chande is higher.&quot; During the welcome dinner, Zhao Xiaozhuo specially analyzed the level setting of U.S. officials to the U.S. Navy Feng Dewei, vice president of the center, asked for advice. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Calles, the official leader of the US delegation at this forum, kept a low profile and rarely appeared in public. On the evening of October 30, she appeared at a small seminar on &quot;China-U.S. Crisis Management&quot;, but did not speak. She only briefly communicated with the participants after the meeting. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, &quot;the level of the participants in the forum is not the most important matter. The communication between the two parties focuses on the substantive content.&quot; Wu Qian, spokesperson of the Ministry of National Defense, pointed out at a press conference held before the opening of the forum. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;International Issues &quot;Desktop Collision&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;At 15:00 on October 29, half an hour before the official start of the meeting, the conference room with less than 100 people was packed with people from all over the world. Representatives, experts and media, etc. This is a dialogue titled &quot;China&#39;s Role in Maintaining Asia-Pacific Security.&quot; Under the chairmanship of Wu Xinbo, experts from China, the United States, Russia and South Korea took their seats in turn. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Why can the Asia-Pacific maintain stability for thirty years?&quot; The host first asked the question. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fu Ying, a former Chinese diplomat, shared &quot;the reasons for the Asia-Pacific economic miracle&quot;: peace and stability, focus on regional cooperation and dialogue, and economic globalization. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She gave data from the Bank of Asia, &quot;In the past 42 years, Asia&#39;s GDP has grown seven times. Nearly half of it was created by China.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;And the United States&#39; GDP has grown seven times. Michael Swan, chief director of the East Asia Project at the Western Institute of National Affairs, believes that &quot;the change of power between China and the United States will bring huge uncertainty to Asia. In the next 10 to 15 years, the process of peace and stability in Asia may be disrupted.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Shi Wen&#39;s view was refuted by Fu Ying: &quot;Today, China is the driving force of the development miracle in the Asia-Pacific region, and the United States has also benefited greatly from it, but now this has become a problem?&quot; Fu Ying said, The United States has launched a &quot;China-US trade war&quot; that has more gains than losses. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;Fu Ying refuted American scholar Shi Wen during the celebrity dialogue on October 29.

American scholar Shi Wen and Director of the Asian and African Studies Department of the Japanese Defense Research Institute Masuda Masayuki were criticized by Chinese scholars one after another. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“The Northeast Asian issue depends on the interaction of multinational relations between China, Japan, the United States, and South Korea.” Shi Wen said. He was the third speaker at this forum, and there were also scholars from China, Russia, South Korea and the UK. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Shi Wen flicked the tablet on the armrest of his seat, trying to regard the North Korean nuclear issue and the Taiwan issue as the same type of regional conflict. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Soon, the moderator of the sub-forum, Vice President of the China Institute of International Strategic Studies, and retired major general Du Nongyi made his point clear, &quot;The core of the Taiwan issue is China&#39;s sovereignty and territorial integrity. It has nothing to do with North Korea.&quot; Nuclear issues and other issues cannot be compared with each other.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the second half, Japanese scholar Masuda Masayuki became the target of public criticism because he blamed China for regional security problems. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yang Xuguang, senior adviser to the China Institute for International Strategic Studies, took the microphone and changed his original speech. He said that Masuda Masayuki was trying to teach the Chinese people &quot;a lesson&quot;. &quot;It is true that I am a little speechless.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yang Xuguang pointed out that the crux of the problem between China and Japan is rooted in Japan&#39;s psychological imbalance, trying to regard the Sino-US game as a &quot;rare opportunity&quot; to take action, and constantly pointing fingers at the Taiwan issue. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During the rebuttal, Masuda Masayuki sat on the stage and smiled awkwardly. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Let developing countries have a voice&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In the international public opinion field dominated by European and American countries, the voices of developing countries are rarely heard. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Although it is a global village, every country has its own goals.&quot; At the &quot;Chinese and Foreign Young Officers and Scholars Seminar&quot; on October 29, Chief Executive Officer of the Pakistan Balochistan Research and Development Think Tank Official Jawariya Tareen said frankly. The young American scholar next to her had a serious expression. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For more than seventy years, the India-Pakistan border issue has remained unresolved, and Kashmir has always been like a thorn in the relationship between the two countries. Jawariya mentioned that every time Pakistan wanted to have dialogue, India did not respond positively, and the relationship between the two sides only stopped at the think tank level. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Developing countries face two major problems, one is development and the other is security.&quot; Lieutenant General He Lei of the Chinese Academy of Military Sciences told Southern Weekend reporters that in a sense, developing countries are the most important problems in today&#39;s world. The security demands of the &quot;vulnerable groups&quot; should receive more attention and reasonable concerns. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to the Beijing Xiangshan Forum, internationally renowned security forums include the Shangri-La Dialogue, the Halifax International Security Forum, the Munich Security Conference and the Seoul Defense Dialogue. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;These forums have obvious &#39;circle&#39; attributes, and developing countries do not have much room to express themselves.&quot; Zhao Xiaozhuo mentioned that only the Beijing Xiangshan Forum clearly provides a stage for developing countries to fully express themselves safety concerns and demands. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;Representatives from various countries at the main venue (Photo by Lu Huiqian)&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/70713a9895. jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;645&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/70713a9895.jpg&quot; data-key= &quot;256575&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Main venue representatives of various countries.
