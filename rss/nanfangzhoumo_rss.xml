This screenshot of the research report comes from the special research report on BYD released by the Western Securities R&amp;D Center on October 24, 2023: &quot;BYD (002594.SZ) first coverage report: Cost is the shield, technology is the spear, and the sword points at the global automotive leader&quot; . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On page 26 of the research report, in order to present the output power of BYD&#39;s Yi Sifang four-wheel motor, Western Securities compared the output power, engine, and body of BYD&#39;s U8 and T-90 main battle tanks. , amphibious, on-site U-turn, lateral travel, zero-hundred acceleration and the number of driving wheels, and concluded: &quot;The technical indicators of Yi Sifang&#39;s four-wheel motor are comprehensively leading the industry.&quot; Looking up at the amphibious and lateral travel functions of U8, T -90 tanks are &quot;none&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to Blue Whale Finance, a relevant person from Western Securities responded that the report was not written by an intern, and that the comparison of BYD’s U8 with main battle tanks was affected by relevant publicity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What is the impact of relevant publicity? Previously, many self-media compared BYD’s U8 with tanks. Regardless of whether the research report of Western Securities was influenced by self-media, but comparing electric vehicles with main battle tanks, and then claiming that its technical indicators are comprehensively leading the industry, whether the relevant arguments and conclusions are rigorous and reasonable will naturally be questioned by investors and public opinion. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, in June this year, Western Securities and analysts were punished for research reports. According to the warning letter from the Shaanxi Supervision Bureau of the China Securities Regulatory Commission: After investigation, the internal control mechanism for the securities research report publishing business of Western Securities is not sound, individual surveys did not fulfill the pre-approval procedures, sales staff participated in the assessment of research report analysts, and compliance management did not cover expert consulting services. The main business links; the quality control and review of research reports are not strict, and some research reports have unreasonable valuation forecasts and imprudent conclusions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The relevant securities research report produced by Luo Yamein, the signed analyst of BYD’s research report, has problems such as imprudent research methods, lack of reasonable justification for some assumptions, and insufficient basis for some conclusions. Not only was it shown The warning letter is also recorded in the securities and futures market integrity files. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Less than half a year later, Western Securities and the same analyst released another controversial research report. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, this was not done by a securities firm called Western Securities. In recent years, there have been numerous cases of securities companies being fined for &quot;weird research reports&quot;. On December 30, 2021, the Jiangxi Securities Regulatory Bureau issued two law enforcement documents, punishing Guosheng Securities and its researchers for their conduct related to the research report &quot;A Preliminary Study on the Application of Heavenly Stems and Earthly Branches in Timing&quot;. On October 18 of that year, a report titled &quot;A Preliminary Study on the Application of Heavenly Stems and Earthly Branches in Timing&quot; by Guosheng Securities attracted public attention. In the report, it is explained in detail how the &quot;Heavenly Stems and Earthly Branches&quot; dominate the market&#39;s time cycle, and how to apply the &quot;Heavenly Stems and Earthly Branches&quot; in timing. Liu Fubing, who issued this research report, has been in the industry for more than 12 years and has been listed as the best analyst of New Fortune 8 times, including No. 1 6 times. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If we say that the above-mentioned research report is &quot;even if it is not shocking, it will never stop&quot;, so it has become a talking point for people. There is also a type of &quot;weird research reports&quot; that are more likely to mislead investors. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In July 2020, the Jiangsu Securities Regulatory Bureau posted an administrative penalty decision against two analysts Ma Haobo who signed the research report &quot;Fucheng In-depth Report 2: Three 10 billion to support doubling of market value&quot; , Tang Weiliang were fined a total of 200,000 yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2016, a research report released by Soochow Securities boldly predicted that Fucheng Shares (600965.SH), &quot;the number one A-share funeral stock&quot;, would be the absolute leader in the funeral industry in the future. And gave Fucheng shares a &quot;buy&quot; rating. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, on October 25 of that year, Fucheng Shares issued a &quot;clarification announcement&quot; to clarify the relevant contents of the research report. Soochow Securities&#39; &quot;Fucheng Research Report&quot; stated that the number of tombs after the completion of the third phase of Fucheng&#39;s pagoda cemetery will reach 400,000. Based on this data, it was concluded that Fucheng&#39;s net profit would be 15.5 billion yuan. After investigation, Fucheng Co., Ltd.&#39;s pagoda cemetery plans to build about 125,000 tombs. &quot;Fucheng Research Report&quot; also stated that the industrial merger and acquisition fund jointly established by Fucheng Co., Ltd. and an investment company has a total scale of 10 billion yuan. The current scale is 1 billion yuan, and the follow-up fund scale will be 9 billion yuan. After investigation, as of October 2016, the size of the above-mentioned M&amp;A fund was only 1 billion yuan. The status of subsequent funds will need to be made by Fucheng Shares based on the progress of the first-phase fund and the quality of the assets acquired. Third, &quot;Fucheng Research Report&quot; stated that the company&#39;s major shareholders have 10 billion in cash and have sufficient funds to serve as the backend of the above-mentioned merger and acquisition funds. After investigation, as of October 2016, the major shareholders had not made a decision in this regard. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The relevant quoted data in the research report released by Soochow Securities is far from the actual data of Fucheng Shares. I am afraid that the source of the information and whether the data has been investigated and verified are all a mess. How can a research report like this deserve market credibility? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The so-called research reports are analysis reports prepared by financial institutions such as securities companies, fund companies, banks, etc. They mainly include company analysis reports, industry analysis reports, investment strategy reports, etc. The purpose of the research report is to help investors better understand the market, the company, and the industry so that they can be used as a reference when investing. However, the content is full of errors and omissions, pointing the research direction towards Feng Shui, or making gimmicks of comparing electric vehicles with main battle tanks, which reflects that some brokers do not pay attention to the professionalism of the research report, and even use the research report as a tool for speculation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The motivation behind securities firms’ “weird research reports” cannot simply be attributed to sensationalism. In financial markets, information release is a form of power to some extent. Therefore, regulatory authorities have corresponding standards for financial institutions, listed companies, and media to release various types of investment-oriented information. As professional information providers, brokerage research reports influence investors&#39; decisions to a considerable extent. However, in the process of pursuing so-called market influence, some securities companies make some shocking remarks to attract attention and attention. There will be traffic or profit considerations, and they may even interfere or distort market trends. Since brokerages are also one of the important stock holders in the stock market, if a brokerage publishes a research report that is &quot;bullish&quot; or &quot;short&quot; on a listed company or a certain sector in an exaggerated way, and secretly buys or sells the corresponding stocks, wouldn&#39;t it be typical? Manipulation of the stock market? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this regard, regulatory authorities have also promulgated relevant new management policies many times in recent years. In May last year, the regulatory authorities sent the &quot;Notice on the &quot;Double Random&quot; On-site Inspection of the Securities Research Report Business to all securities firms. The report shows that in 2022, a special &quot;double random&quot; on-site inspection of research and reporting business will be carried out in the entire industry, covering a total of 45 securities companies and 300 research reports. In September of that year, the China Securities Association reiterated the self-regulatory management of the securities research business of securities firms, including that holdings of more than 1% of the research target stocks must be disclosed and that reverse operations are not allowed within two trading days of the release of the research report; however, various management measures do not seem to hinder The continuation of &quot;Weird Research Reports&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This shows that for strange research reports, the regulatory authorities’ punishment and supervision need to be strengthened. Warning letters, inclusion in integrity files, etc. cannot touch the core interests of relevant personnel and securities companies, so that they would rather have short-term market effects than adhere to compliance. Only by clarifying the responsibilities of securities firms in the production and release of research reports and continuing to increase penalties for violations can the regulatory authorities stop the vicious cycle of &quot;bad coins eliminating good coins&quot; in securities firms&#39; research reports. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 19 Nov 2023 13:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[18亿元起拍，衡阳政务数据资源特许经营权转让为何暂停？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260897]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-19 12:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;This round of transfers in Hengyang is considered the &quot;first sale&quot; of government data and has attracted widespread attention.

Visual China/Picture&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On November 15, 2023, the Hengyang Municipal Public Resources Trading Center issued a notice stating that according to the request from the transferor Hengyang Municipal Administrative Approval Service Bureau, the &quot;Hengyang Municipal Government Data Resources and Intelligence&quot; is now suspended. &quot;Urban franchise rights transfer project&quot; transaction activities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Five days ago, the official website of Hengyang Public Resources Trading Center announced that it would sell Hengyang municipal government data resources and smart city franchise rights through online bidding, with a starting price of 1.8 billion yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Nowhere has previously auctioned and transferred government data resources in the form of a franchise. Therefore, this round of transfer is considered the &quot;first auction&quot; of government data and has attracted widespread attention. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“After receiving a letter from the Hengyang Administrative Approval Service Bureau, the transaction was suspended, but the letter did not explain the specific reasons.” A staff member of the Hengyang Public Resources Trading Center told Southern Weekend reporters that there had been The company called to inquire about the project. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Two staff members of the Hengyang Municipal Administrative Approval Service Bureau confirmed to Southern Weekend reporters that the above-mentioned franchise transfer project was suspended because they received notification from the superior department. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;The state is coordinating this (public data) work, and they will give some guidance before proceeding.&quot; A staff member of the Hengyang Municipal Administrative Approval Service Bureau told Southern Weekend reporters that the project is on hold. , the plan still needs to be improved. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Does not involve national security, business secrets or personal privacy&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;According to the official website of Hengyang Public Resources Trading Center, the transfer was approved by the Hengyang Municipal Government, and the subject matter is divided into two parts: government affairs data resources and smart cities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In December 2021, Hengyang, Hunan Province issued the &quot;Hengyang Municipal Government Data Sharing and Open Management Measures&quot; (hereinafter referred to as the Management Measures). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The management measures clearly state that government data refers to various types of information such as documents, materials, charts, pictures, videos and data produced or obtained by government departments in the course of performing their duties and recorded and saved in a certain form. Resources include information resources collected by various government departments directly or through third parties in accordance with the law, authorized and managed in accordance with the law, and information resources formed by relying on the government information system to perform their duties. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Encourage the open utilization of information under the conditions of ensuring data security, personal privacy and corporate commercial confidentiality.&quot; The management measures state that it is necessary to promote the registration and confirmation of open data, value assessment and other work, and actively explore the data market operations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The management measures state that public data that involves national security, business secrets and personal privacy, or that is not allowed to be opened in accordance with laws, regulations and other regulations, are parts that are not allowed to be opened. Any leakage of state secrets, work secrets, business secrets and personal privacy will be dealt with in accordance with the National Secrets Law and relevant regulations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In June 2023, Guizhou issued a document requiring that big data authorities at all levels authorize qualified market entities to operate government data at the same level and develop data that does not involve state secrets, commercial secrets, or personal privacy. Data services and products and trade through Guiyang Big Data Exchange. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The above-mentioned management measures of Hengyang state that the data rights belong to the government, and Hengyang Development Investment Group Co., Ltd. is authorized to develop and operate it through a franchise. According to the Enterprise Alert, the company is the largest urban investment platform in Hengyang, with assets exceeding 140 billion yuan, and is 100% owned by the Hengyang Municipal State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the Hengyang Municipal Party Committee and Municipal Government believe that the government data operation effect of Hengyang Development Investment Group needs to be improved. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On July 27, 2023, the official website of the Hengyang Municipal Commission for Discipline Inspection and Supervision released the &quot;Notice on the Progress of Inspection and Rectification by the Committee of the Communist Party of China Hengyang Development Investment Group Co., Ltd.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The second issue reported is &quot;Ineffective implementation of the decisions and arrangements of the municipal party committee and municipal government.&quot; In this regard, the rectification situation reads, &quot;Accelerate the injection of some asset resources that have been expressly determined by the municipal party committee and government... Actively strive to complete the joint review of the implementation plan of government data resources (including Hengyang Mass App) and smart city franchise rights.&quot;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;What content is involved in smart cities is not mentioned on the official website of Hengyang Public Resources Trading Center and the transaction attachments. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The pricing method for public data is not yet clear&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;On the official website of Hengyang Public Resource Trading Center, the transfer of government data resources will adopt a bidding method, with a starting price of 1.8 billion yuan, each time The price increase is 10 million yuan. It is disclosed in the transaction attachment that the starting price is the appraisal price of the target, but the columns for the appraisal agency and the appraisal base date are both blank. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Why did the project evaluation price reach 1.8 billion yuan? Staff from the Hengyang Administrative Approval Service Bureau did not respond. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Currently, the pricing of data resources is an industry problem. In February 2023, Zhao Jingwu, associate professor at Beihang University School of Law, wrote an article stating that data valuation indicators are not unified and data quality standards are difficult to determine. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He believes that even in general data trading activities, the so-called market pricing is just the result of self-negotiation between the parties to the transaction. This &quot;one thing, one discussion&quot; data valuation model is difficult to achieve for digital purposes. The market provides sufficient reference basis. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Government data faces the same problem. On November 16, at the main forum of the 2023 China Data Element Industry Innovation Conference, Wang Jiandong, deputy director of the Price Monitoring Center of the National Development and Reform Commission, said, “Before the end of this year or early next year, management measures for government-guided pricing of public data may be introduced. ”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The official website of Hengyang Public Resources Trading Center shows that the return mechanism of the government data resource franchise project is “user pays”. During the franchise period, the franchisee can charge fees from users within the scope of the franchise in return for project construction. However, the official website did not announce the specific number of years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One interviewee’s company is responsible for building a government data platform for a southern province. He explained to Southern Weekend reporters that users who will pay mainly refer to enterprises in various places that have information business needs, rather than individuals. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Prior to this, Hangzhou, Qingdao and other places have also tried to authorize operations for public data. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In September 2023, Hangzhou released the &quot;Public Data Authorized Operation Implementation Plan (Trial)&quot;. The document states that the next step is to determine the operating entity of the authorized operation platform, and with the consent of the municipal government, will be specifically responsible for the construction and operation, data management, operation and maintenance, and security of the authorized operation platform. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hangzhou’s plan states that priority will be given to supporting the development of public data authorization operations in the fields of credit, transportation, medical care, health, employment, social security, education, technology, finance, enterprise registration and supervision, housing construction, provident funds, and public security. , led by the competent departments in the field. Public data that is prohibited from being opened shall not be authorized for operation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 19 Nov 2023 12:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[首位博士说 | 卞建林：刑诉法要保障个人权利]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260865]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-19 11:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Doctoral profile: &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p >; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>;Bian Jianlin, the first litigation jurist in New China PhD. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>;1953 Born in Taixing, Jiangsu Province in October. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>;1960 -1965, Jinjiang Primary School, Taixing Town, Taixing County, Jiangsu Province. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>;1965 -1971, junior high school and high school department of Taixing Middle School in Jiangsu Province. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>;1972 -In 1979, a worker at the commercial refrigerated ship repair and manufacturing plant in Jiangsu Province. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>;1979 From September to July 1983, he was an undergraduate student in the Law Department of China University of Political Science and Law. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>;September 1983-July 1986 In September, he graduated from the Graduate School of China University of Political Science and Law, majoring in criminal procedure law, and received a master&#39;s degree. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>;In August 1986, he stayed at the school and served as a full-time researcher at the China Legal Research Institute. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>;In September 1987, he studied for an on-the-job doctoral degree in litigation law at the Graduate School of China University of Political Science and Law; &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>;In July 1991, he was awarded a doctorate in litigation law, becoming the country&#39;s first doctorate in litigation law.

This year, Bian Jianlin turns 70. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;At two o&#39;clock in the afternoon on October 18, 2023, Bian Jianlin appeared at the door of the office of China University of Political Science and Law on time. He was tall and thin, wearing a fitted black casual suit and a trousers. He was wearing trousers and holding a red paper bag in his hand, which contained three volumes of &quot;Governing the Country by Law and Criminal Procedure - Collected Works of Bian Jianlin&#39;s Legal Studies&quot;. For his 70th birthday this month, the publisher specially planned this collection of essays. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In 1979, eight years after graduating from high school, Bian Jianlin left his hometown in Jiangsu and entered Beijing Political Science and Law School, which had just resumed school after the Cultural Revolution. College, which is now China University of Political Science and Law. Relying on employee scholarships provided by the state, Bian Jianlin completed his bachelor&#39;s and master&#39;s degrees. Just before life was about to reach another fork in the road, &quot;a major event happened.&quot; In 1986, the third batch of law doctoral programs in the country was confirmed, and two law professors from China University of Political Science and Law were appointed as doctoral supervisors. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In 1987, Bian Jianlin studied under Professor Chen Guangzhong, who is recognized as the &quot;founder of criminal procedure law&quot; in China. Four years later, he became the first doctoral student in criminal procedural law independently trained by the People&#39;s Republic of China, and embarked on a career development path similar to that of his mentor. To date, Bian Jianlin has trained 87 doctors and 11 postdoctoral fellows. He also serves as the honorary dean of the Procedural Law Institute of China University of Political Science and Law, the executive director and academic committee member of the China Law Society, and the honorary president of the China Criminal Procedural Law Research Association. He works as a professor at Jilin University, Wuhan University, Zhongnan University of Economics and Law, East China University of Political Science and Law, Northwest University of Political Science and Law, People&#39;s Public Security University of China, and National Prosecutor&#39;s College. On social media, he always actively participates in various seminars and academic lectures to share his understanding and suggestions on the construction of the criminal procedure system. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Unwilling to flaunt himself, Bian Jianlin almost never talks about his past experiences in public. Even in this two-hour interview, the topic never got around to his mentor.

This collection of essays has a profound impact on my academic work. It means life summary, so I said a few words in the preface. I was admitted early at the University of Political Science and Law, and was in the first class after the school was re-established. However, compared with other scholars who entered earlier, I was still relatively older when I entered. Fortunately, I completed my bachelor&#39;s degree, master&#39;s degree and Ph.D. in one go, so I gained some time back. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>; What were you doing before you were admitted to the Beijing University of Political Science and Law in 1979? How did you think of studying law? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Bian Jianlin:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;After graduating from high school in 1971, I went to work in a provincial factory. Later, the college entrance examination was resumed, but after all, it was not a required option. Very few of my high school classmates went on to college. At that time, everyone had a job and even got married and had children. But I still have a little bit of ambition, and I have such an ambition to take the exam. As for studying law, it is almost an inevitable choice. First of all, during the ten years of turmoil, our generation was wasted. Basically, we did not learn mathematics, physics and chemistry, and we were seriously partial to subjects. It was not easy to take the science and engineering exams, so we had to choose from liberal arts. Foreign languages, Chinese, history and law, among which law is definitely the most attractive. The main reason is that many of the books I read in the past were about solving crimes, about identifying doubts and clearing grievances, punishing evil and eradicating evil, and upholding justice, so I naturally developed a legal feeling. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>; Why study Criminal Procedure Law? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Bian Jianlin:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;When I was an undergraduate, the school had only one law major, and there was no further subdivision. major. When I was about to graduate, I decided to take the postgraduate entrance examination. According to my personality and interests, I didn’t really like civil law. What I liked most was the “study of criminal justice”, so my major choice should be criminal law. However, there is a certain degree of chance in choosing criminal procedure law. The school&#39;s master&#39;s entrance exams for Criminal Procedure Law and Criminal Law only differed in one subject, Criminal Procedure Archeology Chinese, while Criminal Law was the history of the legal system. In the year of the postgraduate entrance examination, I went home to celebrate the Spring Festival. After the Spring Festival, I had to take the exam. I thought that I would have to work hard to prepare for the legal history course, and there is always some basic knowledge in ancient Chinese, so it was just a matter of thought. The choice of exam subjects suddenly determined the direction of my major, so it was not that I realized the procedure from that time on. value and importance, because in fact substantive law was still ranked ahead of procedural law at that time. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>; Law is a practical subject. During your studies, didn’t you ever think about getting into practice? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Bian Jianlin:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;To learn the law, you must use it. Logically speaking, you have to work in the practical department , plus I was relatively old when I entered school. At that time, a bachelor&#39;s degree was enough, and I also studied for a master&#39;s degree. So I faced two choices at the time. One was to follow my family&#39;s wishes and return to Jiangsu. The Provincial High School wanted to recruit a Mature judges are more interested in me; if they stay in Beijing, they want to go to the Interpol China National Central Bureau through an old leader of the Ministry of Public Security. I did have some thoughts, but in the end both options were given up, and they were not implemented to the extent of signing a contract. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>; Why gave up? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Bian Jianlin:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;In 1986, before I graduated with my master’s degree, the school was approved for two doctoral programs, including Two teachers were identified as doctoral supervisors, namely Professor Wang Xuan and Professor Chen Guangzhong. Teacher Chen is responsible for the litigation law major. They are also the first batch of doctoral supervisors at China University of Political Science and Law. After receiving the PhD approval, Teacher Chen once talked to me. First, he told me that I had the opportunity to continue my studies; second, he expressed his affirmation to me. After Teacher Chen chatted with me, I was more tempted, although I didn’t fully appreciate the school’s advantages at the time. The most important thing is that my nature is that I am always uneasy about the status quo and have an upward spirit. I have never thought of being rich and settling down. In this way, I decided to continue studying for a Ph.D. after graduating with a master’s degree. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>; You obtained your master&#39;s degree in 1986 and your doctoral program was approved in the same year. How come it was only a year later that you started studying for your Ph.D.? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Bian Jianlin:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I started preparing for the Ph.D. exam before and after I graduated with my master’s degree. However, although the doctoral program was approved at that time, there were insufficient preparations for public announcements and enrollment listings. Due to various reasons, neither doctoral program enrolled students that year. However, Teacher Chen happened to be the deputy dean of the Graduate School at the time, and the school established a new research institution, the Chinese Legal Research Institute, with Teacher Chen also serving as the director. So I stayed in school and worked at the China Legal Research Institute, doing full-time research, doing projects, and writing articles. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>; How many doctoral students studied with you under Professor Chen? Why were you the first doctoral student to graduate? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Bian Jianlin:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Frankly speaking, in the first year of enrollment, the instructor has candidates in mind , but you still have to follow the formal process when applying. At that time, unlike now, the papers were basically judged on the spot after the exam, and the results were known quickly. Finally, Teacher Chen recruited me, and also recruited someone from our school. He was a master&#39;s student in criminal law in 1984, just one class after me. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Speaking of this, it is also a coincidence. If the school had recruited doctors in 1986, he had not graduated with a master&#39;s degree at that time, and we would not be classmates. . However, although we are both in the first batch of doctoral students, he is a full-time student, while I am a part-time PhD student because I have already stayed in school to work. According to the country&#39;s degree regulations at that time, those studying for a PhD on the job would have to study longer than those studying full-time. As for how long, there is no clear regulation. So I extended my studies by one year and graduated in 4 years. If calculated according to this time, it is possible that he graduated before me, then I will not become the first doctorate in criminal procedural law. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;But the students in the same class later went to study in the United States and never came back, leaving me alone to hold on. Later, I joked that if he didn&#39;t leave, he would definitely graduate before me, and the title of the first doctor of litigation law would belong to him. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;&quot;Follow the teacher&#39;s steps&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekends:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;The first batch of 18 Ph.D.s was produced in 1983, but the first recipient of a doctorate in law was graduated in 1987. Among all disciplines, law is not a niche, and it is not too early to cultivate a doctorate in law. What do you think?&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Bian Jianlin:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I think the reason for getting a doctorate in law is a little later. First, the doctoral program was of high value at that time. At that time, the approval of the doctoral program and the determination of the doctoral supervisor required the approval of the Academic Degrees Committee of the State Council, which was very strictly controlled. The second reason is that from the perspective of faculty and research level, law was still a discipline with relatively scarce talents and did not have the conditions to train doctoral students. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>; In 1988, Professor Chen Guangzhong edited the book &quot;Comparative Research on Foreign Criminal Proceedings&quot;. Three years later, your doctoral thesis &quot;Comparative Research on Criminal Prosecution Systems&quot; was approved. From a professional research perspective, did Professor Chen have a great influence on you? big? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Bian Jianlin:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Teacher Chen has always attached great importance to understanding and learning from foreign litigation systems. When we were still studying for master&#39;s degrees, there was a very lack of teaching materials. Basically, each school compiled and printed its own teaching materials. It happened that when Mr. Chen was the deputy dean of graduate students, he brought a topic from the Institute of Law of the Academy of Social Sciences on foreign criminal litigation. A comparative study of procedures. At that time, reform and opening up had already begun, and we were encouraged to study China&#39;s issues from a global perspective. Based on a group of experts from the Law Institute, Teacher Chen recruited some scholars from our school and other schools who studied this field to work together on this work. . Several of our classmates who are still studying for master&#39;s degrees also participated in part of it. I participated in writing a chapter, that is, compulsory medical measures, but I did not sign my name separately. I completed it under the guidance of my supervisor. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;At that time, this book was the first domestic comparative and systematic study of foreign criminal procedure. It was both authoritative and precious. If you want to know more about it, If you know something about it abroad, you must read this book. For those of us who participated in writing this book, because writing required research on foreign materials, only the University of Political Science and Law had this condition at the time, so it was the first step for me to broaden my academic horizons. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;In the previous In an article, you called Professor Chen &quot;the leading figure in criminal procedure law in New China.&quot; Do you have any observations about his academic studies and his conduct as a person? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Bian Jianlin:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Teacher Chen is a recognized master and an important founder and leader of our discipline. people. I feel that my husband&#39;s biggest specialty in learning is to learn from the best of other schools, to be open to all rivers, and to be tolerant, so later on he suddenly surpassed other teachers of his generation and was beyond the reach of others; the second is to know people and make good use of them, and make full use of their talents. Every time he writes something or works on a project, he can always hand over the relevant content to the most suitable person; the third thing is to be able to pay attention to and accept new things, and constantly improve himself by guiding students. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In addition to learning, the teacher also has a strong sense of responsibility and mission. He cares about current affairs and is now 93 years old. He is still paying attention to social phenomena and judicial practice. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Professor Chen’s Do personal traits influence you? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Bian Jianlin:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Mr. Chen has had a great influence on me. Over the years, I can say that I have been closely related to him. He followed suit every step of the way. In addition to the master-disciple relationship, my position also determines why my behavior, knowledge and knowledge are closer to those of my husband. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>; You and Professor Chen have been promoting the localization and application of some overseas experiences. In this process, what impact has reform and opening up had? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Bian Jianlin:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Mr. Chen is an iconic figure in the field of criminal procedure law in my country. The development and improvement of the criminal procedure system can be said to have made a great contribution and deserved the most credit. In terms of participation in legislation, when the Criminal Procedure Law was formulated in 1979, there were relatively few scholars involved. Mr. Chen was still in Guangxi at that time. I feel that this was his regret. The revision of the Criminal Procedure Law in 1996 was an opportunity to make amends, and Mr. Chen played a great role in the revision of the law. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;I still remember that in the winter of 1992, after Mr. Chen became the president of China University of Political Science and Law, his first symposium was held at the school. In the now demolished international student building, the director of the Criminal Law Office of the Legal Affairs Committee of the Standing Committee of the National People&#39;s Congress came with the director. At that time, the law was being revised. In 1993, because I assisted Mr. Chen in promoting the first revision of the Criminal Procedure Law, I was sent to study at New York University as a core member of the research team. Later, I participated in an inspection delegation led by Mr. Chen to several European countries. The director of the Criminal Law Office of the Legal Affairs Commission also participated in the inspection. After returning to China, the Legal Affairs Committee formally sent a letter to the school, entrusting Mr. Chen to lead a research team to provide opinions on the revision of the law. A year later, Mr. Chen’s research team submitted a 350,000-word “Recommendation Draft for the Criminal Procedure Law of the People’s Republic of China” to the Legal Affairs Commission, of which 65% of the provisions were absorbed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In addition to domestic projects, I assisted Mr. Chen in conducting some international exchanges and cooperation and conducting some comparative law research. For example, students are sent to study abroad, translated and published some criminal proceedings of representative countries, and promoted the implementation of the international human rights conventions and the implementation of the United Nations criminal justice standards in China, and so on. It should be said that it has done a lot of beneficial things to promote the development of my country&#39;s criminal proceedings system, and has also promoted the discipline construction and talent training of the litigation law of China University of Political Science and Law. These University of Political Science and Law were unique at that time. For other schools, there were neither the strength of this team, but also the necessary conditions and abilities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; &lt;strong>; Southern Weekend: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: Kai style_gb2312, stkaiti;&quot;>; Modify the Constitution in 2004 At that time, Professor Chen proposed to write &quot;national respect and protection of human rights&quot; into the constitution; in 2012, when the second prosecution law was repaired for the second time, this one was written into the criminal lawsuit law. As his student, you have always advocated that the criminal lawsuit should protect personal rights. Why do you have always paid attention to this issue? &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; &lt;strong>; 卞 卞: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span>; The relationship between human rights protection and criminal litigation is very close. The criminal lawsuit is a typical field of public power, and it is the heavy weapon for national governance. For a long time, due to the influence of ideas, institutions, and even ideology, we regard criminal lawsuits as a contest between the country and the crime, emphasizing the punishment of crimes, which leads to the power of the national special agencies in the lawsuit. Correspondingly, the rights and interests of criminal suspects, defendants, and other participants will not be fully protected. From the perspective of social development, the country&#39;s comprehensively promoting the governance of the country according to law and building a rule of law in accordance with the country must pass the rule of law and regulate public power through procedures, so as not to let power alienation and abuse. Through their own efforts, we strengthen human rights protection in justice, affect legislation, and improve judicial. Under the leadership of Mr. Chen, we also made our own efforts and contributions for this. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; &lt;strong>; &quot;The law of apprentices is not enough&quot; &lt;/strong>; &lt;/h4>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-alft: left; &quot;>; &lt;strong>; Southern Weekend: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span style =&quot; font-family: regular body, regular body_gb2312, stkaiti; &quot;>; In the previous school lecture, you discussed the case of unjust and false cases. Judicial progress, from the perspective of past news reports, the agent lawyers of many cases are called &quot;dead lawyers&quot;. What do you think of this group? &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; &lt;strong>; Bian Jianlin: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span>; The defense system and the lawyer&#39;s profession reflect the level of rule of law in a country. If the level of lawyers in a country is weak and the defense system is not sound, the progress of criminal prosecution is impossible. When the Criminal Procedure Law was formulated in 1979, there was basically no lawyer. In 1980, there was a temporary regulations on lawyers. Therefore, the provisions of legislation on the defense of lawyers were relatively backward. However, since the amendments to the Criminal Procedure Law in 1996 have improved the lawyer&#39;s defense system. Generally speaking, the progress of the defense system is obvious to all. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; But at the same time, it should be seen that the law of lawyers&#39; defense stipulates that there are still many problems in the defense of lawyers in judicial practice. I think one of the important reasons is that they did not find the accurate positioning of lawyers&#39; occupations and lawyers. In criminal proceedings, the responsibilities of the defense lawyer are to defend the defendant. From all perspectives such as facts, evidence, legal applications, procedure operation, etc., problems are found to promote the fair treatment of the case, thereby improving the level of rule of law. In terms of nature, lawyers are not exercising public power, not members of the case handling agency. And we have different management methods for lawyers. Lawyers are managed by judicial administrative organs, and judicial administrative organs belong to the component of national specialized organs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; In judicial practice, in order to provide effective defense, in order to safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of the parties, or to obtain the legal procedure, it is more true when performing the responsibilities of the defense. Sometimes the case -handling personnel handling personnel conflicts, so some lawyers are called &quot;deadly lawyers.&quot; But if they are not true and do not die, they will not be able to protect the interests of the parties, and they cannot defend the work normally. Recently, some extreme examples have occurred. For example, a court of guests in Guangxi, forced lawyers to conduct security inspections, which are difficult to violate the legitimate rights and interests of lawyers, have a bad impact, attracted the attention of the people of the whole country, and they were also named by the Supreme Court. I think that after such extreme things happen, the entire court system should be considered to be disciplined. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; &lt;strong>; Southern Weekend: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: Kai style, Kaiti_gb2312, stkaiti;&quot;>; It seems that this contradiction is like It exists in many of our legal systems. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; &lt;strong>; 卞 Jianlin: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span>; The apprentice method is not enough. The law on the paper is to become the law in the action, and it really takes time, and various problems will occur during the execution process. In a certain sense, many problems in my country&#39;s current judicial practice, or the dilemma faced, are also brought by the system development. Some seemingly good things, but it is difficult to do it. It may touch the interests of some people and even intensify contradictions. I think the problems in development still depend on development to solve. On the one hand, they must understand the situation and pay attention to practice on the one hand; on the other hand, once the law is modified, the authority of the law must be maintained. Take the lead to abide by the law and comply with the procedures prescribed by the law. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>; In the past, everyone said that theory is a humanities and social science, and now that theory is the engineering department in humanities and social sciences. What do you think of this view? &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; &lt;strong>; 卞 卞: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span>; There is no doubt that law science is human and social science, at least a study, or in other words, or in other words, or in other words, It is science, and at the same time it does have some attributes of engineering, especially our discipline, which is very applied and operable. When we were studying in the past, we learned the &quot;Criminal Procedure Law&quot;. Now it is called &quot;Criminal Procedure Law&quot;. The word &quot;learning&quot; is actually realized that this is a science and a knowledge system. Not only does it explain the law, but it also uses it to govern the society to achieve good results. Taking the facts of the case as an example, it is not only a matter of epistemology, but also involves value theory and methodology. It is necessary to use legitimate procedures to regulate the power of the case handling agency. The procedure method is generally a standardized operation. There must be a specific set of principles, methods, and system specifications, and it must be meticulous and meticulous. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>; From more than forty years of schooling and academic experience, what experience can you share with young students? &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; &lt;strong>; 卞 卞: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span>; Whether you are learning or a teacher, I actually learn from Mr. Chen He set an example for us, teach us that we must have patriotism and worry about the people, open vision, and research spirit. This is what I work hard to follow when I do learning. In addition, I often remind students that they should care about current affairs and the present. Many things happen to us every day, or there are cases that are closely related to our professionalism every day. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; As for how to learn and write articles, this is indeed not an easy task. I feel that first individuals need to work hard, and at the same time need opportunities. For example, when we were studying, we should say that there are more opportunities. In the past, we are missing people because of a disconnection, and society is urgently needed. In this way, there will be this first one, that first one. Now the law of law has become a manifestation. Young people are under great pressure, but there are not many opportunities. Then you need to be more diligent and work hard.

Recently, recently, recently, We found that it is combined with the new crown epidemic. &quot;During the conversation, the theater director and German director Kai Words said that this version of&quot; The final &quot;has performed for eleven years. , What we have seen from this play has been changing. &quot;&lt;/P>; &lt;p>; &lt;img src =&quot; http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/18 /yjd8u4hbneqqhztsbqk6l0ovad60hzlyppyaFubf.jpg &quot;Border =&quot; 0 &quot;width =&quot; 960 &quot;height =&quot; 640 &quot;data-src =&quot; // Images.infzm.com/medias/image /23/11/18/yjd8u4hbneqqhztsbqk6l0ovad60hzlyppyaFubf.jpg &quot;Data -Key = &quot;258748&quot;>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>; Becrt drama &quot;The final&quot; was created in the late 1950s. This version of this version of China has been in Europe. Play for eleven years. &lt;span style = &quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>; (the organizer confession/picture) &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Woggs refined the four characters into two clown -like people, retaining the Lord The comparison of tension between the servants: Ham&#39;s physical disability, but has the power to control Claud; Claud is relatively free to move, but is always dominated by his master to do unnecessary trivial things. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The most noticeable adaptation is Voggs&#39;s focus on the sense of cycle. Before the performance, there was an infinite cycle line, and only once appeared in the original script. Vogges recreated it more than a dozen times in the opening of each dialogue or ending. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; A new plot in the play brings &quot;climax&quot;: After Claud struggling, she fired at Ham. After the monologue, Ham suddenly answered and got up from the ground, as if nothing happened. Claves and him returned to the endless dialogue in the past. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;Beckett actually showed a cycle of ritual sense on the stage. The ending of this sense of ritual cycle is satisfying, nothingness, or the end of the world. Everyone can see different ones. Click, I have my own interpretation, I presented on the stage, and it also has this meaning. &quot;At the beginning of the rehearsal, Voggs hoped to show the loop that could not be relieved on the stage, but it would not make the audience feel bored. The feeling is what he wants to find. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Since 1998, Vogges has been a drama and opera director in Austria and Germany. Germany&#39;s drama is relatively lagging in digital innovation. During the art director of the German Dortmund theater from 2010 to 2020, Wagers began to try to combine digital media with drama to introduce digital thinking into the drama stage, which is a pioneer. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In these works, digital methods such as VR, real -time images, and on -site editing are endless, and &quot;Final&quot; pursues the minimalist style of Becrt. The dazzling lights and lines and lines of the mechanical cycle of the character have made this human spiritual wasteland picture scenery with cold science fiction. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The &quot;desert&quot; and &quot;dead branches&quot; in Barkt&#39;s original works are more traditional image, and there is no trace. In the dance, the play chose a form of extraordinarity. Like that door, a few sets and props are outlined with white chalk lines. Three -dimensional life, like being locked in a two -dimensional space. When the machine gun and toy dog, when the actor was removed and held in his hand, it was just a thin wooden board hanging on the wall. The clock has no pointer, and the bottle flower is not proportional. The only physical object is a wooden chair with armrests in the center of the stage, hanging in the air bulbs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The actor&#39;s performance has a consistent German -style accuracy, which has achieved the movement with small changes in the duplicate. The actors who played Ham sat on the chair with eyes closed with their eyes, but still showed a strong dominance and oppression in the relationship through tone and gesture. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The sound is the third &quot;starring&quot; of this play, which expands the information and emotional density in the minimalist world. Klau&#39;s footsteps are constantly echoing in the space, powerful, but as flat as the scenery, you can&#39;t hear a specific sense of direction. A strong conflict between footsteps and no directions. Every time Klau drops down the things, it will make a huge cracking sound, regardless of the telescope, machine gun or toy dog. The laws of the physical world have failed here. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The two who are both master and servant and their father and son are imprisoned in the depth of death. Their house is indeed like the chessboard in the final of the international chess game in a sense. Ham is a general on the chessboard. He needs to ensure that he is in the &quot;center&quot; position of the house and controls his chess pieces. Crowv&#39;s soldier can also reluctantly move a few steps. However, under the command of the blind man Ham, the situation that must be lost has been determined, but they cannot and dare not leave the house, just as the chess pieces cannot leave the chessboard. Outside the house, &quot;there is no nature&quot;, and even pushed the window, seeing &quot;Zero (None)&quot; written on the blackboard. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; They pass the time in jokes, control, torture each other, tell the stories that have been talked about again, and read the window that has already overlooking countless times. In the bottom of the eyes, some people walked through the window. However, their expectations were empty, and all the moves were not meaningful. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; At the end of the show, I found that the opening was the final. &quot;What time is it?&quot; &quot;Like usual.&quot; They said the dialogue when they first opened. Everything stopped abruptly, the remaining silence and darkness. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 19 Nov 2023 10:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[冒充专家行医十年，靠秘方自制抗癌药：无证“神医”的罪与罚]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260877]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;i>; 2023-11-19 08:59:00 &lt;/i>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>; &lt;img alt = &quot;&quot; God Doctor &quot;to sell a pile of titles to patients.

The People&#39;s Court of Huangdao District of the Municipal City was sentenced to 12 years in prison for &quot;crime of production and sales of fake medicines&quot; and fined 12 million yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; It is also sentenced to Hou Yuanxiang because of the crime of &quot;production and sale of fake medicines&quot;, and his daughter, son, wife, and ex -son -in -law were sentenced to 11 to 3 years, respectively. In addition, the son of Hou Yuanxiang&#39;s three sisters was involved in the case. He was sentenced to 11 years in the first instance of &quot;fraud&quot; and &quot;hidden crime&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The total sentence of 6 people above is 50 years, with a total of 29.8 million yuan. Southern Weekend reporters inquired online on the referee documents that in the fake drug cases in recent years, the first trial of the Hou Yuanxiang case was very rare for the weight of torture and the amount of fines. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; However, the case has not yet been settled. After the first trial judgment, as Hou Yuanxiang and others appealed, many self -media appeared on the Internet to &quot;shout the grievance&quot; for it, and some associated the case &quot;folk Chinese medicine&quot; group, saying that &quot;the lawsuit lost, almost all &#39;folks have lost. Chinese medicine &#39;people must close the door. &quot; (For details, please refer to the report &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.infzm.com/content/260879&quot;>; &quot;The Internet Public Opinion War of Treatment of Cancer&quot; &lt;/a>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Hou Yuanxiang&#39;s agent The lawyer questioned the qualitative of the drugs involved in the case, and believed that after the revision of the Drug Management Law in 2019, the threshold for fake drug identification increased. Hou Yuanxiang&#39;s homemade drug was made of Chinese medicine materials as raw materials. The crime of selling fake medicines. &quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; On August 30, 2023, the Qingdao Intermediate People&#39;s Court ruled that the original judgment was revoked on the grounds that the first trial decision was &quot;determined that the facts were unclear and the evidence insufficient evidence&quot; would be revoked and the case was returned. &lt;/p>; &lt;H4>; &quot;Old Chinese Medicine&quot; &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; After being detained on February 17, 2022, Hou Yuanxiang only stayed in the detention center for more than 20 days. Since then, the police have changed compulsory measures due to his illness and changed to &quot;surveillance&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The second instance acting lawyer Li Gang met Hou Yuanxiang after the National Day in 2023. According to him, the two police officers were in one class, three shifts, and looked at him 24 hours. A native of Yishui County, Linyi City, provincial, once worked as a teacher in the county, followed up for a suspension of salary, and changed his career to be a doctor. Since then, the family was moved to Weifang to settle. Around 2019, after purchasing real estate in Qingdao, the Hou Yuanxiang and his daughter Hou Jing mounted the hukou to Qingdao. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Hou Yuanxiang&#39;s confession in the first instance judgment did not explain his experience in studying medicine. Some media said that Hou Yuanxiang was Zhang Moumou and Lou Moumou from two &quot;famous Chinese medicine medicine&quot;, but the southern weekend reporters did not find the latter two as a &quot;famous Chinese medicine&quot; information. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; However, it is certain that Hou Yuanxiang is not a &quot;family of six generations&quot; and &quot;six generations of medicine&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; According to Hou Yuanxiang&#39;s wife and sister to China News Weekly, Hou Yuanxiang was originally a elementary school teacher. He started to study medicine around 40 years old. The relative emphasized that Hou Yuanxiang &quot;was powerful&quot; -whether it was cancer and what cancer &quot;knew it.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; As a daughter -in -law, Li Jianying told the southern weekend that she did not know how Hou Yuanxiang learned Chinese medicine. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Most patients call Hou Yuanxiang as &quot;Professor Hou&quot;, and Hou Yuanxiang&#39;s WeChat personality signature is also &quot;Professor Hou&quot;. The &quot;Central Land Health&quot;, which claims to provide communication, display, and promotion services for &quot;folk physicians&quot;, still has a personal introduction of Hou Yuanxiang, saying that he is a &quot;doctor of international medicine&quot; and &quot;international cancer authoritative expert&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; However, according to Hou Yuanxiang&#39;s confession, his profile on the Internet, including &quot;Professor of Chinese Medical College&quot; and &quot;PhD in International Medicine&quot;, &quot;All are fake&quot;, &quot;It is to expand the influence and let patients believe in I&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In fact, Hou Yuanxiang did not obtain a physician&#39;s practice certificate. Since the implementation of the Practicer Law in 1999, whether it is Chinese medicine or western medicine, medicine must have a physician practice certificate, otherwise it is &quot;illegal medicine&quot;, and it will be punished by administrative penalties and criminal responsibility. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; A patient with a surname of Xu said that she began to find Hou Yuanxiang to see a doctor in 2014. After that, she introduced many patients to Hou, and asked Hou to go to the winery to go to the winery. During the hospital, he found that Hou didn&#39;t get a physician practice certificate, and he doubted his identity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Not only patients, but even some senior medical circles have confident Hou Yuanxiang&#39;s identity and ability. According to the first trial judgment, Hou Yuanxiang had a long -term consultation in the De Medical Hall of the Private Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital in Qingdao. Later, the person in charge of the German Medical Hall asked Hou Yuanxiang to hang the qualifications of the physician in the hospital. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; According to the testimony of Shen Yufa, the dean of Zibo Yiyuan Ruikang Hospital, before 2010, he met Hou Yuanxiang at a medical academic meeting in Beijing. Tumor, cancer, and cardiovascular and cerebrovascular are famous. &quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Later, Shen Yufa&#39;s wife got cancer and used Hou Yuanxiang&#39;s self -made medicine. Shen Yufa also hired Hou as the &quot;part -time professor&quot; of Ruikang Hospital and sold Hou medicine in the hospital. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; According to Hou Yuanxiang&#39;s confession, Shen Yufa invited him to take a clinic at Ruikang Hospital, but he refused because he did not have a physician&#39;s practice certificate, and the two sides only sold drugs to cooperate. However, the son of Shen Yufa and the other employees of the hospital confirmed that Hou Yuanxiang was in the hospital for irregularities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In addition to private hospitals, there are also public hospitals who have worked with Hou Yuanxiang. In 2016, as a public hospital, the Weifang Municipal Organ Organ Hospital had issued a post on his WeChat public account, saying that Hou Yuanxiang was a &quot;international cancer research authoritative expert&quot; and will go to the Chinese Medical Branch for consultation every month. This article has only disappeared recently. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The patients believe that Hou Yuanxiang, in addition to his online resume, is also dazzling, but also because of its &quot;accurate&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Dong Shijie is the relative of a patient with a Jilin patient. According to him, Hou Yuanxiang travels to Changbai Mountain, entertains to eat by herself, and Hou Yuanxiang lives on the spot. &quot;There is a friend who has high blood lipids and high blood pressure, and he can touch it.&quot; Dong Shijie told the southern weekend reporter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; However, according to the first instance judgment, Hou Yuanxiang acknowledged that he would not actually be pulse. The reason why pretending to be the pulse is &quot;to put it plainly to let the patient buy medicine.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; When I learned that Hou Yuanxiang would not be a pulse, Dong Shijie was shocked: &quot;He is a Chinese medicine, he won&#39;t see what he is seeing?&quot; >; &lt;p>; According to the judgment of the first instance, since 2011, Hou Yuanxiang, Hou Jing and others have not obtained the drug production license and the drug business license, etc., and have invested in the false personal introduction of Hou Yuanxiang on the Internet. Consultation and sales claim to be anti -cancer drugs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In Hou Yuanxiang&#39;s fake medicine case, the first thing that happened was her daughter Hou Jing -like her father, she also had no physician practice certificate. On January 16, 2022, after receiving a complaint report, multiple departments in Huangdao District, Qingdao jointly law enforcement, arrested Hou Jing on the spot. Subsequently, Hou Jing confessed Hou Yuanxiang and his brother Hou Lei. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; According to the judgment of the first trial, Hou Yuanxiang was in the home of Weifang at that time. He didn&#39;t seem to care about it at first. After Hou Jing was detained and asked by the police, he realized that the situation was serious. And production tools, but it is too late. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The court of first instance found that after Hou Jing was detained, Hou Yuanxiang&#39;s wife went to the police station where he handled the case to inquire the news. After returning home, he &quot;hidden the family&quot;, and the police pursued the Hou family online. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; According to Hou Lei&#39;s confession, Hou Jingxiang called him the next day, Hou Jing was arrested. &quot;Two or three days later, my father said that this is not small. Let me not use my current mobile phone. Let me go out to hide. After hanging up, I will take out the mobile phone card and throw the trash.&quot; &lt;/P >; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; As for how Hou Lei participated in these business, Hou Lei said that in the winter of 2019, Hou Yuanxiang &quot;let my wife Li Jianying apply for a bank card ... let me pretend to install me ... Director Li of the hospital, some patients called me when they wanted to buy medicine, and asked me to send the bank card to the patient and let the patient make money. &quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; According to Hou Yuanxiang&#39;s confession, Hou Jing&#39;s relationship with Hou Lei is not good. Hou Lei knows that after Hou Jing made money, he also wanted to follow his father to sell medicines. The formula was just let Hou Lei follow him, and he paid him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Li Jianying told reporters from the Southern Weekend that Hou Lei helped Hou Yuanxiang in Weifang, &quot;equivalent to a courier.&quot; In the first trial judgment, Hou Lei was sentenced to &quot;crime of production and sales of fake medicines&quot;, with a sentence of 8 years and a fine of 5 million yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; According to Hou Lei&#39;s confession, after hiding for a few days, he received a call from Hou Yuanxiang with a strange number and proposed to go to the three aunts&#39; house in Qingdao to celebrate the New Year, and then the whole family arrived at the third aunt&#39;s house. According to Hou Lei&#39;s confession, because he felt that &quot;it was quite big&quot;, he suggested that his father vote for the case, &quot;My father is very angry, saying that I am not his own.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Hou Lei&#39;s son Li Shuai told Hou Lei that he had a relationship to settle the matter, but it took 4 million yuan. After several communication, Hou Lei asked his ex -brother Fu Songjie to send Li Shuai to Li Shuai to 2 million yuan in cash after paying 500,000 yuan. Li Shuai confessed that when he saw Fu Songjie with a sack of money, he was stunned: &quot;I saw so much money for the first time.&quot; &lt;/P>; &lt;p>; Fu Songjie was originally a district in Weifang City Attorney of general surgery of the People&#39;s Hospital, in 2019, he resigned to Qingdao under his ex -wife Hou Jing. Before his resignation, Hou Yuanxiang found him and asked him to be the legal representative of a private hospital in Hou Shen&#39;s shares. After Fu Songjie arrived in Qingdao, because he caught up with the epidemic, he did not settle in his work. Fu Songjie was sentenced to 3 years in the first instance and fined 500,000 yuan. The sentence was the least of all person involved. Fu was the only one who did not appeal. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; After Hou Lei was arrested, he confessed Li Shuai. In the next three days, Li Shuai, Fu Songjie and Hou Yuanxiang were arrested one after another. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; According to Hou Yuanxiang, in addition to the above 2.5 million yuan, Li Shuai also deceived him more than 2 million yuan. The first instance judgment confirmed the incident and stated that &quot;the public security organs will be investigated separately.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In Hou Yuanxiang&#39;s false medicine case, the police checked the 8 houses of Hou&#39;s house. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In late February 2022, after Hou Yuanxiang was arrested for a week, the Ministry of Public Security announced the first 8 major typical cases of drug crimes listed in supervision. &lt;/p>; &lt;H4>; The &quot;secret recipe&quot; &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; In Hou Yuanxiang&#39;s case, the fake medicine is the four medicines made by Hou Yuanxiang&#39;s father and daughter, which are named &quot; Anti -Cancer No. 1 and &quot;Anti -Cancer 2&quot;. According to Hou Yuanxiang&#39;s confession, these two medicines are made based on a &quot;secret recipe&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; However, Hou Yuanxiang said differently about the origin of this &quot;secret recipe&quot;. During the investigation stage of the case, he said that the secret recipe comes from a &quot;second grandfather&quot;. This recipe originally had 5 medicines. On the basis of this, Hou Yuanxiang added shiitake mushrooms, ganoderma, and Cordyceps. I have always wanted to promote this prescription to sell medicines to make money. &quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; However, at the stage of the trial, Hou Yuanxiang&#39;s statement on the &quot;secret recipe&quot; changed -he said that Fangzi was presented by his &quot;teacher&quot; at the end of 2019. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Hou Yuanxiang&#39;s different rhetoric about the source of the secret recipe made a second -instance agent lawyer also felt puzzled: &quot;The truth may only be known by himself.&quot; The lawyer said that Hou Yuanxiang&#39;s anti -cancer &quot;secret recipes&quot; include shiitake mushrooms, Cordyceps, Ganoderma, Plagractic, Black Jujube, Kunbu, Niu Gen, Dandelion Gen, Ginseng, Astragalus, Angelica and other Chinese medicinal materials. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; A Chinese medicine medicine that has been in the world for more than forty years told the southern weekend reporter that these traditional Chinese medicinal materials in Hou Yuanxiang&#39;s Fangzi have both &quot;replenishing&quot; and &quot;attack&quot;. Astragalus, cancer patients in the middle and late stages, most of them are weak in their bodies, and they are good for using some tonic; &quot;attack&quot; such as Kunbu has the effect of clearing heat and dispersing, but it is only suitable for some early tumor patients and is not suitable for advanced stages. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Among the patients of Hou Yuanxiang, there are many advanced cancer patients, and some are found by Hou Yuanxiang because they are &quot;sentenced to death by the hospital.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Different from the &quot;grabbing medicine&quot; in Chinese medicine, Hou Yuanxiang&#39;s anti -cancer drugs are cooked in advance, and they are sold to the patient after bagging. According to his confession, Around November 2020, Hou Jing purchased a machine to make soup medicine. Since then, his father and daughter took turns to use this machine to boil the medicine. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The price of &quot;Anti -Cancer No. 1&quot; is 4620 yuan per service, and &quot;Anti -Cancer 2&quot; is 1920 yuan. Eat a course of treatment with a course, 12 days a course of treatment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; For Hou Yuanxiang&#39;s self -made anti -cancer drugs, Zhao Yin, a lawyer who graduated from the University of Traditional Chinese Medicine and worked at the Chinese Medicine Department of the Hospital for many years, believes that he must be illegal. According to her, Hou Yuanxiang&#39;s homemade medicine, similar to the &quot;medical institution (traditional Chinese medicine) preparation&quot; in the hospital, refers to a fixed prescription preparation that is prepared and used by medical institutions according to the clinical needs of the unit. However, the hospital preparations are the same as drugs. Generally, the approval of the drug regulatory department can be produced and sold, and in principle, only the hospital can only be used for the hospital for use, and it cannot be sold outside. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Zhao Yin said that after the introduction of the Chinese Medicine Law in 2017, the state&#39;s management of traditional Chinese medicine preparations has been relaxed. The provincial drug supervision and management department can be prepared after being recorded. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; However, Hou Yuanxiang&#39;s self -made medicine also did not record. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The Traditional Chinese Medicine Law stipulates that the medical institution formulates a Chinese medicine preparation that should be recorded but not filed, and a penalty is punished according to the production of fake drugs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Zhao Yin still doubts whether Hou Yuanxiang&#39;s homemade anticancer drugs really contain a sufficient amount of Chinese medicinal materials such as Cordyceps claims in the &quot;Secret Recipe&quot;, because the medicine is made by Hou Yuanxiang&#39;s father and daughter. The production standards for production lack due supervision and supervision. Quantitative testing such as Cordyceps is very difficult. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; According to Fu Songjie&#39;s confession, Hou Jing will send Liuwei Dihuang Pills and other Chinese medicines to the patient with the well -boiled Chinese medicine solution. In Zhao Yin&#39;s opinion, in this way, even if the patient feels effective after taking the medicine, it may be the role of proprietary Chinese medicine. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In order to avoid the qualitative of &quot;fake medicine&quot;, Hou Yuanxiang tried to argue with &quot;medicine and food&quot;, which means that he sold food. However, because the names of &quot;Anti -Cancer No. 1&quot; and &quot;Anti -Cancer 2&quot; were marked, it made it difficult for him to justify. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Zhao Yin believes that the drug name of &quot;Anti -Cancer No. 1&quot; and &quot;Anti -Cancer 2&quot; itself is nice, because cancer is the concept of Western medicine, and Chinese medicine generally does not have the saying of &quot;cancer&quot; or &quot;tumor&quot;. It is called the &quot;symptom accumulation&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; For Hou Yuanxiang&#39;s self -made anti -cancer drugs, the above -mentioned Chinese medicine interviewed by reporters in the southern weekend directly called &quot;too boldness&quot;. In his opinion, many Chinese medicines have secret recipes. In order not to leak the secret recipes, they generally only sell medicinal materials to patients, at most to help patients fry on behalf of them. They must not dare to sell them to patients. &lt;/p>; &lt;H4>; Are there any cancer patients being cured? &lt;/H4>; &lt;p>; However, supporters have &quot;shouted unjust&quot; on the Internet on the grounds that Hou Yuanxiang cured many cancer patients. However, the southern weekend reporter&#39;s investigation found that whether there was cancer patients was really cured by Hou Yuanxiang, it was a question. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; After the first trial of the Hou Yuanxiang case, a list of cancer patients who claimed to be &quot;cured by Hou Yuanxiang&quot; were flowing on the Internet. There were personal information of 31 patients or family members of patients on the list. This list is consistent with the southern weekend reporters with one of Hou Yuanxiang&#39;s supporters Gong Feiyun. According to Gong Feiyun, at the end of June 2023, he went to Qingdao to meet Hou Yuanxiang. It was the list given by Hou Yuanxiang himself. Gong Feiyun is a partner of a Chinese medicine museum in a foreign country. He has also been involved in the storm of fake drugs in the past few years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; A reporter on the Southern Weekend called all 31 calls on the list, of which 11 were unaware, 13 rejected, and 7 of the 7 connected telephones acknowledged whether they were on the list. Family members, another person denied that he was the &quot;Provincial Environmental Protection Bureau Director&quot; Che Moumou, who was written by the list, claiming that he was &quot;running business.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Among the 6 people, 3 of them refused to interview on the grounds that &quot;there was something&quot; and &quot;involved privacy&quot;, and only 3 people accepted telephone interviews. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The patient Song Yuan&#39;s family was from Qingdao, Shandong. He claimed to be &quot;sentenced to death by the hospital&quot; and found Hou Yuanxiang with a mentality of trying. Nothing&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The Song and Yuan family told the southern weekend reporter that Hou Yuanxiang&#39;s medicine was &quot;ancestral medicine&quot;, which did not give medicine. He spent more than 200,000 yuan. Okay, eat &#39;Anti -Cancer No. 2&#39; &quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; According to the judgment of the first trial, when Hou Yuanxiang transferred the pharmaceutical and production tools overnight, he asked the Song Yuan family to help. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The Song and Yuan family told reporters to the south weekend that he had read Hou Yuanxiang&#39;s first trial judgment, but he was more willing to believe in the &quot;shouting injustice&quot; video on the media. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Another interviewee Wang Jingjiang is a village in Zibo, Shandong, and the patient is his mother -in -law.他说，侯元祥曾打算在该村建一座疗养院，自己当时给村支书开车，由此认识了侯。后来他岳母得了癌症，已经没有手术可能，做了一段时间化疗后，他就联系了“侯教授”，“那时候是有病乱投医”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;王敬江表示，侯元祥的药“不错”，其岳母喝了感觉“有劲”了，不过后来由于受不了那个味道，就不再喝了。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在中医药法起草论证专家之一、律师杨逢柱看来，侯元祥的“抗癌药”是几种中药混在一起，中药治疗虽然很少有“立竿见影”的，但也不是没有效果，“你补气的（中药）一上，肯定有效果”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;而王敬江也强调：他岳母并不是“治好了”，而是“没（再）犯、没转移”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;第三位受访者李诚（化名）是吉林延边人。他告诉南方周末记者，患者是他爷爷，确实曾找侯元祥看过病，吃过他的自制药。老人家已经于2022年9月去世。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;李诚说，爷爷是2019年7月确诊直肠癌，已经扩散到淋巴。亲戚向他介绍了侯元祥。他至今没见过侯元祥，两人主要通过微信联系。他说，加了微信后，侯元祥曾把个人简介发过来，“什么世界癌症、什么委员会、什么癌症治疗专家，我在百度上也搜了，确实能搜到这个人，当就觉得这个人挺sharp&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在接到南方周末记者电话时，李诚仍称侯元祥为“侯教授”。在得知侯元祥并非教授，甚至连医师执业证也没有时，他很吃惊，表示如果当初知道这个情况，是否还找侯元祥看病“肯定要斟酌”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;李诚说，爷爷除了喝侯元祥的抗癌药，还吃了侯元祥推荐的“营养餐”。 “吃了三个疗程左右，（爷爷）恢复得挺好。”李诚说，为此，他还给侯元祥介绍了不少病人。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;不过，李诚不能确认，他爷爷病情的一度好转，“究竟是侯教授的药起了更大作用，还是我爷爷个人的心态起了更大的作用”。李诚说，“我们都说（侯元祥的药）管用、好使，可能也对爷爷的精神状态起到了支撑作用。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;杨逢柱曾参与过许多药品临床试验论证方面的工作.在他看来，病人在做治疗时，“心理作用很重要，能影响30%（治疗）效果”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;李诚还表示，爷爷在吃侯元祥的药期间，也做了其他治疗包括动手术，“中西医同步发力”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;假药“瘦身”之后&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;无论是代理律师还是侯元祥本人，均未料到一审会判得如此重。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;不过，根据相关法律规定和司机机关查明的涉案金额，侯元祥的自制药一旦被认定为假药，就轻判不了。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一审期间，侯家多名代理律师以侯元祥的自制药没有给病人造成伤害后果为由，进行无罪辩护或罪轻辩护。而侯元祥本人也提出，他的药“小孩都可以喝”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;然而，没有造成伤害后果并不意味着侯元祥不构成“生产、销售假药罪”，也不意味着不可以被重判。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;根据2011年修订前的刑法，构成“生产、销售假药罪”，需要存在“严重危害人体健康”的情况，致人死亡或重伤，才能判十年以上有期徒刑。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;赵因表示，为了加大对假药的打击力度，2011年的刑法第八修正案对“生产、销售假药罪”作了修改，不再把“严重危害人体健康”作为入罪门槛，只要生产、销售假药就构成犯罪。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;与此同时，刑法第八修正案也不再以致人死亡、重伤作为重判的惟一条件，规定有“其他特别严重情节”的，也可以重判。 2014年，最高法、最高检出台司法解释，只要生产、销售假药达到50万元，就构成刑法第八修正案里的“其他特别严重情节”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;而侯元祥生产、销售假药的金额，一审法院认定为1436万余元，远远超过了50万元。这意味着侯元祥的自制药一旦被认定为假药，就适用于要判十年以上有期徒刑。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;侯元祥的自制药能否认定为假药，要以药品管理法为依据。赵因认为，2019年该法修订之前，假药的认定相对简单——药品只要没有取得批号，就符合“以假药论处”，从而构成刑法意义上的假药。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;然而，2019年修订后的药品管理法对假药的定义作了重大修改，没有取得批号的药品不再当然以假药论处。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;业界普遍认为，药品管理法的上述修改与湖南陆勇案有关。白血病患者陆勇从非正规渠道购买仿制药，并帮病友代购此药。 2018年，以其为原型的电影《我不是药神》上映，引发舆论对中国药品管理制度的广泛讨论。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;修订后的药品管理法对假药“瘦身”，规定只有四种情况才能定为假药（详见文后资料链接）。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;据长期从事药品打假实践和研究的北京长江药学发展基金会理事曹国营介绍，药品管理法修订后，药监部门办理的假药案呈“断崖式下跌”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;据国家药品监督管理局网站数据，2019年，全国由药监部门查处的假药案数量为14041起，而在药品管理法修订后的次年，此类案件的数量只有7361起，减少了近一半。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;南方周末记者以“假药”为关键词在裁判文书网搜索，发现以药品管理法修订为分界，假药刑事案件判决书数量从2019年的5044件骤降至2020年的2361件，少了一大半。此后几年也呈下降趋势。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2019年版药品管理法在对假药“瘦身”的同时，大幅加大了罚款力度。 “罚款的起点是生产销售金额的15倍，不足10万的按10万算。”赵因说，“只要是生产、销售假药，起码要罚150万，罚也要罚死他（生产、销售假药者）。”&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;中药材是药品吗？ &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;在曹国营看来，在目前药品打假整体环境下，青岛能查处侯元祥案“很不容易”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;然而，侯元祥是否应以“生产、销售假药”罪被追究刑事责任，却在法律界和中医药界均引起争议。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;侯家代理律师以2019年修订后的药品管理法为由，认为侯元祥的自制药是以中药材为原料制成，不应认定为假药，侯元祥等不构成“生产、销售假药罪”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;事实上，据侯元祥案一审判决书，公安机关最初是以“非法经营罪”对侯元祥等人立的案。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;立案一个月后，青岛市市监局出具假药认定书，对侯元祥的四种自制药认定为假药。根据2014年最高法、最高检出台的相关司法解释，对于“假药”“劣药”难以确定的，司法机关可以根据地市级以上药品监督管理部门出具的认定意见进行认定。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;据上述认定书，侯元祥自制的“抗癌1号”“抗癌2号”、声称治肝癌的“肝”和用来治疗心脏病的“野生心脑汤”四种药被认定为假药。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;案件进入审查起诉阶段后，应黄岛区人民检察院要求，青岛市市监局又专门出具了一份补充说明，对为何将涉案产品认定为假药进行了说明。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;说明中指出，侯元祥的四款自制产品“无药品注册证号、无医疗机构制剂备案、无药品生产许可证、无医疗机构制剂许可证、无国家标准等，却生产出宣传治疗癌症、肝癌、心脑血管疾病等的药品销售给病人治病，涉案产品属于非药品。大家一致认为，上述四种涉案产品符合新修订的药品法关于药品的定义……”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一位二审代理律师指出，上述论述一方面说涉案产品“符合药品的定义”， 另一方面又说其属于“非药品”。在其看来，青岛市市监局之所以如此论述，是因为按新药品管理法，“惟一能卡上的就是这一条（非药品冒充药品）”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;对于侯元祥自制药的假药认定问题，南方周末记者联系青岛市市监局，该局以侯元祥案件正在审理为由拒绝采访。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一审期间，侯家几乎所有代理律师均对该案的假药认定提出质疑。其中一位律师指出，“抗癌1号”“抗癌2号”所使用的药材，大部分均在2020 版《中国药典》一部中，并不符合“以非药品冒充药品”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;不过，在赵因看来，中药材并不当然算作药品——中药材仅是制作药品的原料，可以在药材市场销售，但是药品必须拥有药品经营许可证才可以Sale. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;而侯元祥父女的自制药所用的药材究竟购自哪里？一审判决书所引用的相关供述中并无交代，而侯静也不能提供购进的票据和合法证明文件。据侯静前夫付松杰供述，侯静购买的草药都是通过快递、物流发过来的，收货人一般都是用假名。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;二审代理律师李刚以涉案假药的认定未经过省级药监部门检验为由，对一审判决所依据的假药认定书提出质疑。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;根据最高法、最高检2022年新出台的司法解释（生效后2014年旧司法解释即废止），对于“非药品冒充药品”这一情况，只有在不存在争议的情况下，市级药监部门才可以直接认定为假药。对于存在争议的，则需经过省级以上药品监督管理部门设置或者确定的药品检验机构进行检验。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在李刚看来，侯元祥案涉案假药的认定显然存在争议，理应进行检验。不过他认为，民间中药偏方缺乏国家标准，即使检验其结果也缺乏科学性、合法性。且侯元祥的药当时没检验，现在扣押已超过一年，“早都变质了，怎么检验？”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2023年11月5日，侯元祥另一位代理律师告诉南方周末记者，案件发回重审之后，检察机关向法院补充了不少证据，其中包括一份对侯元祥自制药的检验报告。根据这份检验报告，侯元祥的自制药里检出了用以治疗糖尿病的西药成分，青岛市市监局凭此仍认定涉案产品为假药。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;侯元祥上述代理律师表示，这表明药监部门可能不再按“非药品冒充药品”认定涉案产品为假药。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;对于侯元祥所涉罪名，广东法全律师事务所律师杨志伟向南方周末记者提出另一种观点：如果侯元祥的“抗癌1号”“抗癌2号”明确与治疗癌症“不搭界”，侯元祥完全是以卖药赚钱为目的，那么他有可能构成诈骗罪。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;南方周末记者在裁判文书网上查到这样一个案例：2019年，没有行医资质的李某祥，因生产、销售假药罪被抓，但检察院以诈骗罪将其逮捕和起诉，法院以诈骗罪对其判处有期徒刑14年。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;侯元祥是否可能涉嫌诈骗罪？ A reporter from the Southern Weekend asked about a first -instance lawyer of Hou Yuanxiang. After a few seconds of silence, the lawyer asked: Scam? Isn&#39;t that heavier?随后，他表示侯元祥“不大可能”构成诈骗罪。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;侯元祥的另一位一审代理律师认为侯元祥构成“妨害药品管理罪”。该罪名是2020年出台的刑法第十一修正案新设立的，它指向生产、销售没有取得批号却未被认定为假药的药品的犯罪行为，该罪名比“生产、销售假药罪”要light. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这位律师未接受南方周末记者采访，但说了这样一句话：“如果说判他（侯元祥）家无罪，那咱们都可以以中医的名义去做中医的任何事情。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>;资料链接：药品管理法2019年修订前后对于“假药”的不同定义：&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>;修订前：有下列情形之一的，为假药：&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>;（一）药品所含成份与国家药品标准规定的成份不符的；&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>;（二）以非药品冒充药品或者以他种药品冒充此种药品的。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>;有下列情形之一的药品，按假药论处：&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>;（一）国务院药品监督管理部门规定禁止使用的；&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>;（二）依照本法必须批准而未经批准生产、进口，或者依照本法必须检验而未经检验即销售的；&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>;（三）变质的；&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>;（四）被污染的；&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>;（五）使用依照本法必须取得批准文号而未取得批准文号的原料药生产的；&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>;（六）所标明的适应症或者功能主治超出规定范围的。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>;修订后：有下列情形之一的，为假药：&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>;（一）药品所含成份与国家药品标准规定的成份不符；&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>;（二）以非药品冒充药品或者以他种药品冒充此种药品；&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>;（三）变质的药品；&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>;（四）药品所标明的适应症或者功能主治超出规定范围。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 19 Nov 2023 09:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[“抗癌神医”的网络舆论战]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260879]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-19 09:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;侯元祥被调查期间，网上出现自媒体为其“喊冤”的大量视频。农健插画&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/18/a383d51fc2.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;953&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/18/a383d51fc2.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;258747&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;侯元祥被调查期间，网上出现自媒体为其“喊冤”的大量视频。农健插画&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;侯元祥的一位二审代理律师向南方周末记者坦言，对一审被重判的侯元祥来说，二审是“背水一战”。而该案二审能发回重审，“媒体起了很大的作用”。 （侯元祥案报道详见&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.infzm.com/content/260877&quot;>;《冒充专家行医十年，靠秘方自制抗癌药：无证“神医”的罪与罚》&lt;/a>;）&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;该律师所说的媒体指的是网络自媒体。 In fact, the media reports of the mainstream institutions reported Hou Yuanxiang&#39;s fake medicine cases after the second instance ruling was returned to retrial. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在自媒体助力下，本来名不见经传的侯元祥，被描述为一位被冤判的“治癌神医”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“有公安背景的女子”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;2023年3月中旬，侯元祥假药案一审判决一个多月后，一篇题为《九岁鑫鑫求助：妈妈救治三千多癌症患者却被判刑十一年，罚款三千万》的文章开始在网上传播。该文称，侯元祥女儿侯静用中药祖传秘方治好了很多疑难杂症，但其所配制的中药液被青岛市监局“毫无依据”地定为假药，侯静一审判刑11年，全家牵连。文中还附上了侯静9岁儿子对外求助的照片：“妈妈您治病救人何罪之有啊？让全国网友替你评论吧……”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;此文引发网友热议。 The reporter from the Southern Weekend noticed that this article emphasized that Hou Jing graduated from the University of Traditional Chinese Medicine and was a Chinese medicine division, but he could not mention Hou Jing without a physician&#39;s practice certificate. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;侯元祥儿媳李建英告诉南方周末记者，一审判决后，侯元祥想利用网络“喊冤”，当时曾要她家孩子的照片，她担心孩子会受影响，就没给。后来才用了侯静儿子的照片。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2023年6月底，自媒体人吴鹏飞开始介入侯元祥假药案。 Wu Pengfei claims to be &quot;old journalists&quot; and &quot;well -known online writers&quot;. They have an account number on platforms such as Douyin, Kuaishou, and today&#39;s headlines. A reporter in the Southern Weekend found that Wu Pengfei worked in a media in Hubei Province in his early years and set up a planning marketing company after leaving the media.在开始介入侯元祥假药案时，吴鹏飞就曝出一个大新闻：一位有公安背景的女士曾开价一千万，要买侯元祥的治疗秘方，遭到拒绝后曾威胁说，要让侯元祥一家人等着坐牢。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;有多个自媒体博主引用了吴鹏飞上述说法，以至于“有公安背景的女子强买药方不成举报侯元祥”一说，成为侯元祥假药案的主流网络舆论。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;不过，侯元祥的二审代理律师李刚向南方周末记者表示，他虽然听侯元祥说过此事，但并没有看到相关证据，侯元祥也没向司法机关提出有人敲诈勒索他的控告。作为律师，他对这个说法“不予置评”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;侯元祥的一审代理律师杨子宁也告诉南方周末记者，上述说法“在（案）卷里体现不出来”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;南方周末记者注意到，2020年新冠疫情时，吴鹏飞曾力捧过另一位“神医”——宣称注射苯酚能治好新冠的无证医生李跃华，还发布消息称李跃华受韩国邀请前往抗疫，但该消息被韩国官方否认，李跃华本人也对媒体表示他不知道此事。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;南方周末记者试图联系吴鹏飞，但截至发稿，对方未回复。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“民间调查可靠性有多大？”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;在发出上述文章之后，吴鹏飞又在多个平台上连续发布题为《民间中医冤案》的短视频，如今已经播到第100集，其中仅抖音平台一家的播放量就已超过1600万。在这些短视频中，吴鹏飞称侯元祥为“侯老”，说他是“中医治癌第一人”，有“独门医术”和“惊世疗效”，“堪称一位国宝”，“身上的每根汗毛都是金子”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;此外，吴鹏飞还引用了一组数据，以表明侯元祥是“治癌神医”。他说，“一家全国性民间中医组织”对中国十大治癌名老中医的疗效进行了调查：“第一名就是侯元祥，当时确认他治好的癌症患者是1166人，第二名老中医确认治好的仅有11人。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;李建英也向南方周末记者表示，侯元祥“治好了”1166个癌症病人。 “他（侯元祥）都有记录的。”她说。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;不过，吴鹏飞没有说“全国性民间中医组织”究竟是哪家机构。事实上，就连李刚也对吴鹏飞所说的数据持有疑问：“民间调查可靠性有多大？”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在另一个短视频里，吴鹏飞说侯元祥治愈了三千多名癌症patient.而在“央地健康”网（一个声称为“民间医师”提供交流、展示、推广服务的网站）的个人介绍里，侯元祥则是“治愈两万多癌症”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;也有自媒体对侯元祥提出质疑，不过点击量与吴鹏飞的短视频不可同日而语。自媒体“中医陈雷”发过一个视频，称侯元祥是一个“制售假药的骗子”，呼吁公众冷静看待此案：“如果置事实于不顾，不是爱中医，是在害中医。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;视频发布后，“中医陈雷”即遭到侯元祥众多支持者的网络围攻，吴鹏飞更是连续发布8个短视频反驳。没过多久，“中医陈雷”那条视频就下架了。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在网上看到侯元祥假药案后，南京圭石堂中医馆总经理钱辉决定出手声援。钱辉曾有过与侯元祥类似的经历。据媒体报道，钱辉没有医师执业证，为了规避“非法行医”，他的中医馆聘请正规医生给病人开方子，钱辉则会在一旁“指导”， 而医生开的药都是圭石堂根据自家“秘方”做的自制药。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2017年底，圭石堂被人举报，由于未取得批号，其自制药被南京市药监局认定为假药，钱辉及圭石堂多名员工因涉嫌“生产、销售假药罪”，一度被警方刑事拘留，其中钱辉被关了28天。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“我们为什么支持侯元祥无罪？主要原因是站在一个保护传统中医的角度，因为侯元祥的案子一旦是有罪判决，那么很多的传统中医就干不下去了。”钱辉对南方周末记者说。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在圭石堂“合伙人”之一龚飞云看来，传统中医就是“民间中医”，而侯元祥是众多“民间中医”的一个。他对“民间中医”这样定义：体制外中医的统称，没有进大学接受过正规中医药学教育，没有医师执业证。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2013年6月底，龚飞云曾赴青岛面见侯元祥。据龚飞云介绍，当时侯元祥虽已被警方“监视居住”，但当时管得还不严，他想办法将其约出来，并拍了视频。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“民间中医大学”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;龚飞云当年也曾参与圭石堂假药案的斡旋。据他透露，在该案办理期间，圭石堂曾与南京警方打了一场“舆论战”：先是南京一家媒体站在警方立场曝光该案，之后龚飞云联系了一家外地媒体，发出了圭石堂方面the sound of. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;最终，该案停留在公安侦查阶段，没能进入检察院审查起诉环节。经此一劫的圭石堂，此后主打上海市场。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在钱辉和龚飞云之前，另一位“民间中医”支持者管乐也在网上声援侯元祥。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;管乐自称是“民间中医大学首任校长”“长城铭刻人物”“世界中医堂联合会会长”。他将“民间中医大学”形容为民间中医的“黄埔军校”，不过，这所大学3年前就宣称要成立，但至今也没成立。管乐曾公开说，这所大学成立后，将评选“民间中医院士”“民间中医博士”“民间中医教授”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;相关信息显示，2020年6月，成立“民间中医大学”的口号刚喊出，管乐就声称要开一个该大学某地分校的成立大会。而会议结束次日，管乐就在多个中医群发布了一个医疗培训班的广告，声称没有任何医学基础的人都可以当场学会，培训费为两天18000元（可优惠）。不料，此举连带“民间中医大学”，均遭到江苏一家三甲医院医生顾经宇的实名公开质疑，管乐回应说：“民间中医大学”是创新：“既然是创新，肯定就没有任何证，既然没证，那肯定就不合法……”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;去青岛见完侯元祥后，龚飞云与管乐曾在上海会面，两人还一同拜访了华东政法大学一位支持民间中医的教授，并请其就侯元祥案发声。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2023年9月9日，管乐策划的第二届民间中医大学筹建预备会议在北京召开，曾为侯元祥案发声的钱辉、龚云飞、卫柏兴均参与了此次会议，会议期间专门讨论了侯元祥案。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“（侯元祥案）等于把所有民间中医都团结起来了。”龚飞云对南方周末记者说。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;侯元祥假药案二审裁定发回重审后，侯元祥的支持者们一片欢腾，纷纷在网上发布“喜讯”，认为该案出现“重大转机”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;此后不久，有自媒体又曝出一条新闻——侯元祥正在绝食，且消息“千真万确”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;不过，吴鹏飞很快发短视频澄清，称侯元祥是由于身体虚弱吃不下饭，他的徒弟“因为害怕有人暗害侯老，故意对外发布绝食消息，以便引起全社会的关注&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;数日后，吴鹏飞再发短视频，称“侯老”身体恢复，开始每顿“喝一点小酒”，而看管他的警员一天三顿都只能煮面条吃……&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;据二审律师李刚透露，二审发回重审后，因为“知道（侯元祥原监视居住地）的人太多”，警方给侯元祥换了一个地方执行监视居住。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“我不再参与这个事情了”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;李诚（化名）是侯元祥一名吉林籍癌症患者的孙子，他自称在许多事情“都不知道”的情况下，也曾参与过为侯元祥“喊冤”的舆论战。 &lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;两个月后，“流星与晚霞”把李诚拉进了一个支持侯元祥的癌症患者微信群。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;李诚手机里存着一个标注为“李主任抗癌”的号码，这个号码是侯元祥给他的。他为爷爷买药，就是与这位“李主任”联系。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在接到南方周末记者打来的电话之前，李诚一直以为，“李主任”叫“李建英”，是侯元祥所在医院药品方面的负责人。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但实际上，“李主任”是侯元祥的儿子侯雷，“流星与晚霞”才是李建英，她也是侯家所有成年人当中惟一未涉案的一个。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;据一审判决书，在侯元祥案中，侯元祥对外称“侯教授”，负责提供配方、诊疗癌症疾病、销售药品，女儿侯静负责诊疗癌症以外的疾病和销售药品、购进中草药、熬制中药药剂等，儿子侯雷则在后台冒充负责拿药、退药的医生“李主任”，也就是李建英。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;加了“流星与晚霞”微信一个多月后，李诚与侯元祥也联系上了。 “他（侯元祥）说把我的信息放到网上去，我说行，只要对你那边的案情有帮助。”李诚说。 &lt;/p>;

Because according to general understanding, in nature where natural selection and survival of the fittest occur, same-sex sexual behavior consumes precious energy and time but fails to produce offspring. Such behavior should have been eliminated in evolution, but the reality is that same-sex sexual behavior is still in the process of evolution. There is no shortage of them in nature and human society. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Scientists have discovered same-sex behavior in more than 1,500 species of animals. Such behavior is not affected by gender and can occur between two males or two females. It appears in artificial breeding environments and also in the wild. It is not an accidental behavior forced by extreme environments. This also poses a difficult problem for scientists to understand its evolutionary logic. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In October 2023, researchers from the University of Granada in Spain and other institutions tried to verify some relevant explanatory hypotheses through germline analysis of a large number of mammal same-sex sexual behavior information. Their latest research, published in Nature Communications, suggests that the evolution of same-sex sexual behavior is likely an adaptation to nature. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Maintaining same-sex social relationships&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;“Same-sex sexual behavior occurs in many mammalian species, including our relatives the great apes. Rather than classifying it as maladaptive or abnormal behavior, our study shows that this sexual behavior in mammals is a convergent adaptation that helps maintain social relationships and reduce same-sex conflicts.&quot; Lead author of the latest study, while at the Spanish Arid Zone Experimental Station Function and Evolution José M. Gómez, a professor at the Department of Ecology and the University of Granada, told Southern Weekend reporters that although same-sex sexual behavior occurs in many species, it is especially common among primates. This may Precisely because primates are more social than many other groups of mammals. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From a data point of view, research has found same-sex sexual behavior in more than 260 species of mammals. In more than 80% of the cases, it takes the form of back crawling or genital contact, and less than 30% Some species even display same-sex behavior through courtship or pairing. Judging from the age, same-sex sexual behavior mainly occurs in adult mammals, and young same-sex sexual behavior is only found in 10 species of animals. From an environmental perspective, more than 80% of the samples had same-sex sexual behavior occurring in wild or semi-wild environments. In terms of gender, same-sex behavior is relatively evenly distributed among mammals. Female same-sex behavior has been recorded in more than 160 species, and male same-sex behavior has been found in more than 190 species. Combined, about half of all species have same-sex behavior. Homosexuality involving two genders at the same time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is worth noting that the latest study is only based on existing records of same-sex sexual behavior in mammals and does not represent the entire situation of mammals. In fact, because the discovery of same-sex sexual behavior in nature relies on observation, and in some species females and males look very similar, and it is even difficult to distinguish between male and female. Some scientists estimate that the current records of same-sex sexual behavior in nature should be underestimated. Moreover, compared with mammals, birds, reptiles, fish, insects and other invertebrates are either small in size or live far away from the ground, making observation difficult, but they have all recorded same-sex sexual behavior. Therefore, patterns of same-sex sexual behavior in nature are far more complex than what has been observed in mammals. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Previously, many hypotheses interpreted same-sex sexual behavior as maladaptive or abnormal behavior, speculating that this behavior may be a manifestation of specific conditions such as incorrect gender identity, lack of opposite-sex peers, or frustration with opposite-sex sexual behavior. From the perspective of sexual behavior scenarios, the latest research has found that same-sex sexual behavior does not necessarily require extremely special occasions. Although same-sex sexual behavior is rare in some species and can only be observed in very special circumstances, for about 40% of the mammals studied, same-sex sexual behavior can be regarded as moderate to high frequency activity during a specific period of time, and during mating Seasons are easy to observe. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Same-sex and opposite-sex coexist&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;And some behavioral observations have long shown that same-sex sexual behavior may play a positive role in some populations. For example, some same-sex behavior among male bottlenose dolphins may help strengthen alliances among small groups, and same-sex behavior among female bonobo groups may promote reconciliation among members. However, the latest study&#39;s germline analysis does not focus on the mechanisms of same-sex sexual behavior in specific species, but uses large-scale statistics to link same-sex sexual behavior to social behavior. This research shows that same-sex sexual behavior is similar to many other behavioral traits that have evolved through natural selection. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Professor Jose Gomez reminded that the meaning of same-sex sexual behavior here should be understood within the framework of evolutionary biology, which is still different from the current human society’s views on gender and other related issues. Because in the study of evolutionary biology, same-sex sexual behavior is a temporary behavior of individuals in a certain period of time, not a permanent behavior or life choice. They may also have heterosexual sexual behavior at the same time. Therefore, it cannot be directly related to human society. behavior analogy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In human society, issues related to same-sex sexual behavior are rooted in different cultural environments and historical traditions in different places, and are more complicated to understand. But in recent years, the discussion of distinguishing human same-sex sexual behavior has also attracted the attention of scientists. The core concern is to what extent people who have had same-sex sexual behavior can be defined as homosexual. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2019, researchers from Harvard University and other institutions published a large-scale genetic study in Science magazine, trying to reveal the genetic characteristics of same-sex sexual behavior, which is the so-called &quot;homosexuality&quot; Gene&quot;. Through collaboration with the British Biobank and genetic testing analysis company 23andMe, researchers finally identified multiple genetic loci related to same-sex sexual behavior from hundreds of thousands of genetic samples, indicating that the &quot;gay gene&quot; is similar to other behavioral traits. It is also polygenic. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But in 2021, scientists from sex and gender research institutions such as Indiana University’s Kinsey Institute publicly expressed opposition to this research, believing that it only distinguishes people by whether they have had same-sex sexual intercourse. It conflates heterosexuality, bisexuality and homosexuality, and does not accurately measure people&#39;s sexual behavior, sexual attraction and sexual identity. Therefore, the genetic characteristics ultimately discovered may not reveal the tendency to have same-sex sexual behavior, but only reveal the likes. The personality trait of pursuing novelty. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Because in the view of sexology researchers, heterosexuality should be a continuous pattern of sexual attraction. Just because a person has had same-sex sexual behavior does not mean that he is not heterosexual. Alfred Kinsey, the pioneer of sexology research, developed a scale very early to distinguish people who have had same-sex sexual behavior. According to the frequency of same-sex sexual behavior, people can be divided into multiple types, rather than Either gay or straight. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;It may help reproduction&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The controversy in human society about how to distinguish same-sex sexual behavior from homosexuality also reflects a difficulty in understanding the logic of evolution to a certain extent. Compared with human society, which highly binds concepts such as &quot;same-sex sexual behavior&quot;, &quot;homosexuality&quot; and &quot;no offspring&quot;, same-sex sexual behavior may never mean &quot;no offspring&quot; in the long evolutionary history. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Darwin&#39;s paradox of evolution should be put aside; it no longer exists because the existence of bisexual behavior in various animal species ensures that same-sex behavior does not hinder reproductive success.&quot; Empire Vincent Savolainen, a professor at the Department of Life Sciences at the Polytechnic Institute of Technology, told Southern Weekend reporters that there are many concepts surrounding same-sex sexual behavior, but from a biological perspective, same-sex sexual behavior may be the same as homosexuality, bisexuality, etc. There are some similar mechanisms and evolutionary logic, which biologists can continue to study in the future. At the same time, psychologists can also delve into other aspects of this complex behavior, such as sexual preferences, to better understand the evolution of same-sex behavior. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From a historical perspective on same-sex sexual behavior, the key reason why evolutionary logic is difficult to understand lies in the inference that its adaptation costs are too high and the cost of behavior is too high. However, including the latest research, many studies in recent years have shown that same-sex sexual behavior does not mean &quot;no offspring&quot; in the evolutionary process, but may have a positive impact on the reproduction of offspring in other indirect ways. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2021, Brendan Zietsch, a scientist at the Center for Psychology and Evolution at the University of Queensland in Australia, used genetic data from hundreds of thousands of samples to simulate human evolution, which also included a large number of heterosexual Partner data. The analysis shows that among people who only have heterosexual sex, genetic genes related to same-sex sexual behavior can allow people to have more opposite-sex sexual partners at the same time, which means that they have gained a sexual mating advantage. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Further analysis shows that this is also related to the personality traits of openness and risk-taking. People who are more open-minded will be more willing to try new things and have greater curiosity and imagination. Researchers speculate that genes related to same-sex behavior not only endow people with same-sex sexual tendencies, but also give people relevant personality traits, which gives people with relevant genetic genes an advantage in finding opposite-sex partners. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Thus, although same-sex sexual behavior itself does not produce offspring, related genes can give people the advantage of having offspring, resulting in same-sex sexual behavior being preserved to this day in the long evolution. However, Brendan Zic emphasized to Southern Weekend reporters that although this study has data advantages, the relevant explanations are still exploratory, and more research is needed to gain an in-depth understanding of the manifestations related to same-sex sexual behavior in order to understand the basis of its evolution. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Heritability in primates&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Professor Vincent Savolainen has also conducted research on same-sex sexual behavior and reached similar conclusions supporting reproductive advantages. . In August 2023, through the analysis of three years of detailed observation data of rhesus monkeys, they found that same-sex sexual behavior is very common in the rhesus monkey community and is basically not affected by factors such as age or community structure, and it does not bring any consequences to them. What fitness costs, conversely, same-sex sexual behavior regulates peer relationships and increases reproductive success. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Relevant research was published in Nature Ecology &amp; Evolution, observing the social and sexual behavior of more than two hundred male rhesus monkeys. Combining ancestry data from decades ago, the study shows that same-sex behavior in male rhesus monkeys is both repeatable and heritable, with a heritability rate of 6.4%. This provides the first evidence of same-sex behavior in primates outside of humans. The first evidence that behavior is heritable. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Rhesus macaques share more than 70% of their DNA with humans and have a common ancestor with us dating back about 25 million years. They are the main non-human primates used in biomedical research Animals are also excellent models for studying behavioral ecological issues such as same-sex sexual behavior. However, it is worth noting that there are still differences between rhesus monkeys and humans. Through research, we hope to unravel these intricate mysteries and discover the underlying Common behavior in our evolutionary history.&quot; Professor Vincent Savolainen explained to Southern Weekend reporters that the latest research shows that same-sex sexual behavior may be a common feature of primate reproductive ecology, which is important for understanding the behavior of human groups. Same-sex sexual behavior has certain enlightenment, but due to the influence of some unique social factors in human society, same-sex sexual behavior in human society does have a high cost. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Humans appear to be the only species that exhibits strict homosexuality.&quot; Professor Vincent Savolainen said cultural factors can influence this phenomenon. For example, in Samoa, some gay men, although they have no offspring, actually assume the role of women in society and help raise the children of relatives. &quot;I hope our research can play a role in fostering a more inclusive culture that embraces gender diversity, both in nature and in human society.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div >;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt; a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 18 Nov 2023 22:25:23 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[网购二手“人脉”真的靠谱吗？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260873]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-18 21:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 18 Nov 2023 21:25:03 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[不在职业资格目录中的“律师经纪人”，3860元拿证]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260871]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-18 20:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;Lawyers and brokers&quot; have appeared in many lawsuits related to contract disputes.

Yang Mou collided, causing Yang to be injured. Yang then sued Xiao and the two insurance companies that Xiao insured, demanding various compensations totaling about 250,000 yuan. Both of Yang&#39;s litigation attorneys are &quot;lawyers and agents.&quot; In the end, the Shenyang Yuhong District Court ordered the insurance company to pay compensation of about 120,000 yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In a contract dispute with the case number (2022) Liao 14 Min Zhong No. 1093, Yang and Liu signed a tableware factory transfer agreement, stipulating that Yang A certain person paid the transfer fee of RMB 170,000 in installments, but after the first payment period expired, Yang did not pay as agreed. Liu then sued Yang to demand performance of the contract and payment of liquidated damages, totaling approximately 200,000 yuan. Yang lost the case and appealed to the Huludao Intermediate People&#39;s Court, entrusting a &quot;lawyer agent&quot; to serve as his litigation agent.
