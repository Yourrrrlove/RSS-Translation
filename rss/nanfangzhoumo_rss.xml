The fellow pointed forward with his hand. Yang Ping asked again: &quot;Are there any paintings on the walls in the temple?&quot; Yang Ping&#39;s Shanxi dialect is a bit different from that of his fellow villagers, but it does not hinder their communication. He had to travel to every corner of Shanxi. Without such a language advantage, Yang Ping really couldn&#39;t take pictures of the &quot;paintings&quot; in the temples. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When people talk about Shanxi murals, they always think of the exquisite Song and Yuan murals such as Yanshan Temple and Yongle Palace. However, many people don’t know that Shanxi villages, hidden among the mountains and rivers, preserve a large number of village temple murals. Compared with the protection, research and admiration that the murals of the Song and Yuan Dynasties enjoyed, the murals in the village temples seem a bit lonely. They are generally relics from the Qing Dynasty. &quot;These Qing Dynasty murals are not even &#39;village protection&#39;, not to mention &#39;national security&#39;,&quot; Yang Ping said. They quietly serve as the background for the village god statues and are also a touch of interest in the lives of the villagers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/4WPb35vrq7unwyIJyFbvksl88V1sE1awKw9eZ4uA.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;577&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/4WPb35vrq7unwyIJyFbvksl88V1sE1awKw9eZ4uA.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;257554&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Part of the mural on the east wall of a temple in Nancao Village, Shuocheng District, Shuozhou City, Shanxi Province. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of interviewee)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yang Ping has been photographing Shanxi murals for more than ten years. Like many enthusiasts who started taking pictures of murals, Yang Ping also took pictures of Song and Yuan murals at the beginning. After taking more pictures, she found that there were more murals hidden in small temples in the mountains and deserts in Shanxi. &quot;Many people took photos of the &#39;Provincial Protection&#39; That&#39;s all, but I&#39;m different, I want to go to the village,&quot; she said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yang Ping was the editor-in-chief of a travel magazine in her early years. After the magazine ceased publication, she focused entirely on murals and painted sculptures in Shanxi. Over the years, she has photographed more than 400 murals in Shanxi, of which more than 300 were from the Ming and Qing dynasties. &quot;I know about another 20 to 30 murals that I haven&#39;t photographed yet.&quot; &quot;See You Under the Painted Walls of the High Hall—Exploring the Ancient Mural Paintings in Rural Villages of Shanxi, China&quot; is her new book published in 2023. It contains 21 exquisite village temple murals, mostly from the late Qing Dynasty, many of which she discovered for the first time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When you open this little book, you will be greeted by an artistic temperament that is completely different from the ancient and grandiose murals of the Song and Yuan Dynasties. The bright colors, the images of gods full of life, and the small and compact compositions, It all shows that this is an aesthetic taste that comes from the grassroots of the folk. Yang Ping wrote 21 short stories for these 21 murals. Most of them were about her chats with the villagers, family stories, and old rural news. They were written in a relaxed and interesting way. However, in the interview, Yang Ping talked more about the behind-the-scenes of the shooting. The joys and sorrows, as well as her worries about the rural murals. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;The culture left over from each era reflects that era. Rural murals are not just a presentation of art, but also contain a lot of historical information. The implication of this book is actually beyond the murals. &quot;Yang Ping said. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“Almost all the films brought back were scrapped”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Yang Ping’s hometown is Jincheng, Shanxi, which is famous for its ancient buildings. In 2003, Yang Ping spent 360,000 yuan of his own money to start photographing ancient buildings in Jincheng. After taking many photos of buildings, she gradually became interested in the murals inside the buildings. Although she now runs to the village all day long and looks disgraced, she said that she actually loves dressing up. She used to work in fashion travel magazines and liked beautiful clothes. She first fell in love with murals because of their beauty. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2012, Yang Ping got an opportunity to photograph murals and painted sculptures across Shanxi. At that time, she only knew about the murals that were on the cultural relics list. As for how many murals there were in Shanxi, she didn&#39;t know. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Having no experience in photographing murals at the beginning, Yang Ping cast a wide net in Shanxi: there were eleven prefecture-level administrative districts in Shanxi, and each administrative district sent a photography team with at least three people in each team, led by a photographer. Led by a well-known photographer, plus a light and a driver, they plan to take carpet-like photos of murals and painted sculptures throughout Shanxi. It was a huge project, expensive, but the results were disappointing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Almost all the films I brought back were scrapped.&quot; Yang Ping recalled his &quot;recklessness&quot; at that time and smiled unconsciously. The photographers hired by Yang Ping back then were all &quot;big names&quot; in the industry. &quot;They have their own understanding of how to take good-looking photos. If you say it looks like this, they think that will look good. And many of them don&#39;t look good.&quot; I won’t take pictures.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But faithfully recording and “photographing beautifully” are two different things. To faithfully record the entire picture and every detail of a mural, the pixels of each photo must be large enough, which requires photographing a mural in different areas. However, at least one of the murals printed on the book needs to be complete, which means that the photos taken of each part can be combined. This means that different parts of the same mural are photographed, and their shooting angles and pixels are , light, and exposure should be as consistent as possible. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/ruLSclr85wZI8HAUe5EalhAWw0fIVDu2VWY8I9kT.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;520&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/ruLSclr85wZI8HAUe5EalhAWw0fIVDu2VWY8I9kT.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;257556&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Full picture of the mural on the east wall of the main hall of Zhulong Temple. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of interviewee)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If the partial pictures taken are to be combined into a whole picture, hundreds of photos will be combined , the synthesis time takes half a month, and the size of the entire picture is often dozens of G. &quot;They have never filmed like this.&quot; Yang Ping said. The photographers worked on their own, and the photos they took back were of different styles. They were all beautiful, but they just &quot;didn&#39;t add up.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are also some murals that are three to four meters high. If the ladder is not high enough, changes in the camera angle will cause distortion of the picture, and they will not fit together. &quot;When I saw that this picture didn&#39;t work, I went back to training and took another photo. If it still didn&#39;t work, I bought a lot of books for everyone to read...&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This unsuccessful carpet shoot cost Yang Ping a lot of money. The equipment, travel, and labor of the eleven photography teams were all wasted. Later, she realized that the more photography teams there are, the higher the efficiency will be. Mastering the shooting principles is the most important thing. She narrowed the camera team down to two, one of which was shot by herself. Facing a wall of murals, a relatively standard shooting process must be formed: ladders of different sizes must be provided, as well as infrared cameras for partitioning the walls, the lens is a standard Zeiss 50, and a small handheld camera is required. &quot;Many The statue is very close to the mural, so I had to put my hand in to take a picture.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to these general equipment, a shovel and a feather duster are also necessary for taking pictures of murals in the village. The latter is used to brush off the dust on the murals, and the former is a tool for road construction, &quot;leading to There are dirt roads in the village, so we can use them.” Once in a village in Luliang, the road conditions were so bad that the photographer used a shovel for more than an hour to shovel out a &quot;road&quot;. For the last three hundred meters, there was really no choice but to carry all the equipment, large and small, into the village. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“The inscription from thirty years ago is still there”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The first thing you see when you walk into Yang Ping’s studio is a row of albums of Shanxi temple murals. &quot;Yanshan Temple&quot;, &quot;Kaihua Temple&quot;, &quot;Princess Temple&quot;... these famous temples in the history of murals, Yang Ping has made extremely detailed albums accordingly. These albums are one of the results of her more than ten years of photographing murals. Of course, others had photographed them before her, and many albums had been published, but what she wanted to do was to capture every detail clearly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;This book &quot;Yanshan Temple&quot; took three years to shoot. In 2013, 2014, and 2015, it was shot one after another. Every time it was re-shot, when it was published, I found that a certain part was not clear enough, so I Take it again.&quot; Yang Ping said. The Jin Dynasty murals in Yanshan Temple are known as the &quot;Along the River During the Qingming Festival&quot; on the wall. There are many characters and rich details. The rich flavor of life is hidden in the details of the picture. Yang Ping&#39;s requirement is that the identity of each character in the picture, the allusion of each Buddhist and Taoist story, and even the identification of famous jewelry items must not only have clear images, but also be accompanied by academic text explanations. Therefore, the albums she made were much thicker than those of her predecessors. The large octavo volume &quot;Iwamyama Temple&quot; was more than 300 pages thick. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;By the winter of 2013, she had almost finished photographing the &quot;national security&quot; and &quot;provincial security&quot; sites such as Yanshan Temple and Kaihua Temple, and Yang Ping began to systematically photograph the murals in village temples. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At first, Yang Ping just took pictures of the village temple murals when passing by, but as she took more pictures, she gradually realized that the Ming and Qing murals in the village were more unique than the Song and Yuan murals. Its value is completely worth searching for again. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the ancient villages of Shanxi, there are many common gods in folk belief temples, such as Guandi Temple, Niangniang Temple (Sanxiao Niangniang), Dragon King Temple, Mawang Temple, and Dongyue Temple. They may appear alone. They may also appear in &quot;groups&quot; - that is, distributed in different side halls in a temple. The Dragon King blesses good weather, the Empress blesses childbirth and safety, and Guan Di blesses the education of children with loyalty, filial piety, and justice. “Having children, education, and agriculture are all the real needs of the people,” Yang Ping said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/nAoCHFdPsyZq5m4VME0tVCyVxjQOKv6ItbDRTd0c.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/nAoCHFdPsyZq5m4VME0tVCyVxjQOKv6ItbDRTd0c.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;257555&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The female official on the north wall of a temple in a village in Shanxi to the right of the Dragon Queen, two four-value messengers and Feng Po (from right to left). &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of interviewee)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Once, a Dongyue God in a temple blocked the way. The two walls of the main hall of the temple are covered with exquisite colored sculptures, but in the center of the hall stands a colored sculpture of unknown age, hidden in a small wooden pavilion. It is said that it was added by the villagers of later generations. Yang Ping wanted to take pictures of the colorful sculptures on both sides, but the camera was always blocked by the Dongyue God. The photographers went to take pictures five times, but the photos never looked good. In desperation, she discussed with the villagers during the sixth filming: &quot;Can we invite this god outside the temple first?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the old days, this Dongyue god was carried out for parade every year. In recent years, this ritual has gradually disappeared, but the elderly in the village are still worried that carrying it out unconventionally like this will cause bad luck. &quot;They are worried that it will cause heavy rain.&quot; Yang Ping said. A wood-based clay sculpture that has not been touched for decades will probably break if moved carelessly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After finally convincing the villagers, Yang Ping himself had no idea how to move. While several people were anxiously circling the statue, an old man from the village stood up. He was holding a thick hemp rope and quickly tied the statue tightly using a knotting method that he had never seen before. , when four people lift it, it will not tilt up or down, nor will it roll over left or right. &quot;Without the help of this old man, we really wouldn&#39;t be able to take such beautiful photos.&quot; Yang Ping pointed to the page of colored sculptures in the album and said. After the filming was completed, the Dongyue God was placed back. Of course, there was no heavy rain in the village. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Time is passing, and the murals and painted sculptures are also changing with time. Many murals are completely different from when Yang Ping first saw them. &quot;I know a mural from the Song Dynasty, but the inscriptions were still there thirty years ago, but now some of the inscriptions have been blurred.&quot; And some murals from the Qing Dynasty that no one paid attention to can no longer be seen. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Luoquanbao Village mentioned in &quot;Meet Me Under the Pink Wall Candle in the High Hall&quot; is one of the lucky ones. At that time, the local cultural relics bureau followed Yang Ping&#39;s suggestion and renovated the village temple and reassembled the murals. When Yang Ping paid a return visit in 2021, the murals in Luoquanbao were still intact. But there are too few examples like Ring Castle. As a province rich in cultural relics, Shanxi has a lot of cultural relics that cost money, but murals in village temples don’t seem to be ranked high. &quot;Shanxi&#39;s cultural relics department often jokes that asking them to open two banks may not be enough,&quot; Yang Ping said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/Gr4E9FQvqA3u9Yl51rIzpBfvLnJ9PrKBCu4VTIUQ.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;641&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/Gr4E9FQvqA3u9Yl51rIzpBfvLnJ9PrKBCu4VTIUQ.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;257557&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Part of the mural at the Dragon King Temple in Luoquanbao Village. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of interviewee)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;Culture is supposed to nourish people&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Do you want it or not? Yang Ping had hesitated for a long time before publishing the village temple murals and making them public. In 2016, they were shooting in a village near Taiyuan, and the photographer was kicked out by local villagers. Yang Ping understood the common people&#39;s &quot;vigilance&quot; very well: &quot;There are just too many cultural relic dealers.&quot; Murals in village temples are generally not even cultural preservation sites, and are beyond the reach of the official protection system. Although they are hidden in the mountains, they cannot hide from cultural relic dealers. of &quot;diligence&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In a sense, Yang Ping is in a race with cultural relic dealers. “You can’t imagine how diligent they are. In the valley I went to ten years ago, cultural relic dealers walked by. &quot;Yang Ping&#39;s circle of friends was originally completely open. Whatever he saw or photographed, he would post in his circle of friends, but he would not post the specific address. Once, a friend from other provinces chased her over and asked her, &quot;Teacher Yang, can you give me an address for something in your circle of friends?&quot; Yang Ping immediately became wary and said to the friend: &quot;I You cannot take away even a stone from what is in your hand.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But in this book &quot;Meet Me Under the White Wall and Candles in the High Hall&quot;, many village temples have written detailed addresses. Yang Ping said that this was also a helpless move she made after thinking about it for a long time. On the one hand, no matter how well they are hidden, they may not be able to escape the search of cultural relic dealers. Moreover, even if the cultural relic dealers do not find them, most of the village temples in the book have already half collapsed. If they are hidden like this, the fate that awaits them will be gradual annihilation. &quot;It&#39;s better to disclose their status, attract the attention of the whole society, and arouse the villagers&#39; awareness of protection.&quot; Yang Ping clearly knew that a British banker&#39;s home had a collection of murals from the Qing Dynasty. &quot;Most of our researchers are currently concerned about higher No one cares about the ancient murals of the Song and Yuan Dynasties and the murals of the Qing Dynasty.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Song Xiaoli is a reader of Yang Ping&#39;s book. In September 2023, she followed the route in the book and visited several villages in the book. She found that many villagers&#39; awareness of protection had indeed improved a lot compared to when Yang Ping was filming. For example, in the Dragon King Temple in Wayaotou Village, &quot;the villagers have become aware of protection. They covered the murals with thick plastic sheets. After we finished shooting, we covered them up as they were. This is a gratifying discovery.&quot; Song Xiaoli told Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, there are unfortunate examples. The murals in Beicao Village mentioned in the book include the very vivid &quot;Dragon King Raining Picture&quot;. &quot;The Dragon King Temple in Beicao Village has been renovated, and a cultural heritage monument has been erected in front of the temple. However, the Dragon King&#39;s Raining Pictures on the east and west walls of the Dragon King Hall are missing. The cultural preservation department hung two spray-painted display pictures on the east and west walls respectively.&quot; Song Xiaoli explain. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/XMsmu8OOO2pbwAv8zInikH6YVarxqHxkjN6B2KS6.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/XMsmu8OOO2pbwAv8zInikH6YVarxqHxkjN6B2KS6.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;257558&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Part of the mural at Xinglong Temple in Beicao Village. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of interviewee)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Sansheng Temple in Xucun cannot escape the fate of annihilation. This is a temple that integrated Buddhism and folk beliefs during the Ming and Qing Dynasties. The temple has three bays and is dedicated to different gods. The scene Song Xiaoli saw was very different from the description in Yang Ping&#39;s book. &quot;The entire mural on the north wall fell off under the erosion of rain, exposing pieces of mud wall under the ground staff. The upper half of the wall in the west room has collapsed. , no murals remain. The only remaining murals on the west wall are relatively complete, but a large hole collapsed in the northeast corner of the west wall.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm. com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/22JV6GWSbSGTjjeMLrZqJnhVpgHOVHa8EFrUySFO.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;580&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/ image/23/11/08/22JV6GWSbSGTjjeMLrZqJnhVpgHOVHa8EFrUySFO.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;257559&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The West Second Room of the Three Saints Main Hall—— A complete picture of the statues of Dragon Queen Mother, Five Dragon Kings, Rain Master and other gods on the north wall of Dragon King Hall.

Compared with her entire publishing plan, this small book shows only a small aspect of her work. &quot;You have done so many things, and no one knows what you are doing. It never sparks or bubbles. Suddenly it became popular in this book.&quot; The color pictures in the book, for those murals that have been annihilated, It is a precious record. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The big book that Yang Ping has devoted the most to is the soon-to-be-published &quot;Complete Collection of Shanxi Temple Viewing Art&quot;. The &quot;complete collection&quot; includes &quot;The Complete Collection of Shanxi Temple Viewing Colored Sculptures&quot; (ten volumes) and &quot;The Complete Collection of Shanxi Temple Viewing Murals&quot; (twenty volumes), thirty volumes in total. All the painted sculptures and murals she has photographed over the years will be included. This is truly the first publication to include the art of Shanxi mural painted sculptures as completely as possible. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The audience of &quot;The Complete Works&quot; is professional researchers, while the audience of &quot;See You Under the White Wall and Candles in the High Hall&quot; is ordinary readers. Yang Ping hopes that this small book can become a fulcrum and leverage some public awareness. Know. &quot;Actually, I have a motivation. Culture should not only attract educated people, but also attract more ordinary people. Culture should nourish people. Our current culture only nourishes a small group of people, which is not enough.&quot; Yang Ping said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 09 Nov 2023 16:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[买了14幅“毒地”？陆家嘴向苏钢集团索赔百亿]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260262]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-09 15:30:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;span>;17 parcels of land purchased 7 years ago at a cost of 8.525 billion yuan, after 6 years of development It was discovered that 14 pieces of land were seriously polluted.

After 222 rounds of bidding, it attracted Greenland, Poly , Shimao, Vanke, China Merchants and many other real estate companies participated in the bidding. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Lujiazui finally won 95% of the equity of Suzhou Green Bank Real Estate Development Co., Ltd. for a total price of 8.525 billion yuan (transaction price of 6.84 billion yuan, debt of 1.685 billion yuan). &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Lujiazui, which has defeated many powerful real estate companies, is also quite confident about the success of this auction. At that time, the group publicly stated that the successful joint bid for 95% of the shares of Suzhou Green Bank would be conducive to further increasing the company&#39;s land reserves and expanding the company&#39;s development space. &quot;By actively implementing the &#39;going global&#39; strategy, we will further enhance the brand influence of Lujiazui commercial real estate and enhance The company&#39;s sustainable operating ability and profitability.&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;However, Lujiazui&#39;s bold &quot;going out&quot; investment decision was not so smooth sailing. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In 2021, news spread that Suzhou Green Bank accidentally discovered that some plots of the project had serious pollution risks, and a report was made to the local government departments. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In April 2022, the &quot;Processing Status of the Sixth Batch of Letters and Calls Transferred to Our Province by the Second Central Ecological and Environmental Protection Inspection Team&quot; announced on the official website of the Jiangsu Provincial People&#39;s Government mentioned Recently, the test results of a third-party testing agency showed that benzopyrene and naphthalene in the soil of many plots of the Suzhou Green Bank project seriously exceeded the standards and did not meet the land use standards. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;It also mentioned that the Suzhou High-tech Zone Management Committee attached great importance to it, established a special work team, and quickly started work, requiring Suzhou Green Bank to effectively perform its main responsibilities. Before the end of June, a third-party agency will be entrusted to complete the formulation of a soil pollution investigation plan, and the organization and implementation will be organized and implemented. Related work will be carried out in accordance with the law based on the investigation results. During this period, the above-mentioned plots shall not carry out any activities unrelated to the prevention and control of soil pollution. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In the same month, Lujiazui also issued an announcement stating that 8 of the 17 plots of land have been developed. It was unexpectedly discovered that plots 2 and 13 where educational facilities have been built and plots 3 and 4 that have not been developed yet have serious pollution risks. Many elements in the soil or groundwater greatly exceed the standards and do not meet the original requirements of these plots. According to the planned land use standards, the total area of ​​the four plots is approximately 118,000 square meters. As of the end of 2021, the cumulative project investment in the four plots is approximately 450 million yuan&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Due to the exposure of land pollution problems, the Lujiazui project had to be stopped. &lt;span>;Public information shows that the above-mentioned land No. 2 and land No. 13, where the pollution was determined, are planned to build Suzhou Reading School and a kindergarten respectively. &lt;/span>;When they were named by the Central Second Ecological Environmental Protection Inspection Group in 2022, the two plots of land had been completed. According to media reports, due to pollution problems, Suzhou Reading School failed to welcome its first batch of new students in September 2021 as scheduled, and the students of the school are transitioning to Suzhou Science and Technology City Foreign Language School. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/09/d980d31c5b1e354c588b40313463a985.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;660&quot; height=&quot;467&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/09/d980d31c5b1e354c588b40313463a985.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;257627 &quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span>;Aerial view of Suzhou Reading School.

The infringements together resulted in the plaintiff receiving the land involved in the case that was seriously polluted. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Lujiazui requested that the defendant be ordered to pay compensation of RMB 10.044 billion to the plaintiff (if it is subsequently discovered or clear that the actual amount is higher than this amount, the lawsuit will be increased or a separate lawsuit will be filed) Responsibility; request a ruling to order defendants 2, 3, 4 and 5 to bear joint and several liability for the claim in item 1; request a ruling to order that the litigation costs of this case shall be jointly borne by all defendants. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;This lawsuit with a claim amount of up to 10 billion yuan quickly aroused heated discussion in the market. According to estimates by industry insiders, based on a fee of 0.5%, the litigation costs in Lujiazui may exceed 50 million. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/09/24e0ac78e19d13eb4da0c064a2a137f3.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;677&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/09/24e0ac78e19d13eb4da0c064a2a137f3.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;257630 &quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;br>;&lt;span>;As for the reason why Lujiazui sued for large compensation, Wang Yuchen, director of Beijing Jinliu Law Firm, told reporters that the main reason is that it may face pollution problems on the land where the construction project is located. Huge legal risks and legal liabilities, and the Suzhou Iron and Steel Group, appraisal institutions, etc. in this incident will also have corresponding legal risks and legal liabilities. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;It further stated that as far as Lujiazui Group is concerned, according to the current information, it has a large scale of construction, many types of projects, and a huge amount of capital investment in the land involved in the case. , and related projects were found to have serious pollution in the land during construction, completion, sales and other aspects. Construction suspension, completion acceptance failure, sales suspension, rectification and repair, re-appraisal, etc. are all problems that Lujiazui Group is currently facing or will need to face in the future. Behind this, only in terms of civil liability, there is the risk of breach of contract in various contracts such as construction contracts signed with construction units and house purchase contracts signed with owners. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&lt;span>;A claim of 10 billion yuan, what is the probability of winning? &lt;/span>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Wang Yuchen told reporters that if Suzhou Iron and Steel Group knew about the land contamination of the relevant land parcels at the time of the transfer and had the obligation to know but failed to perform it, it would Intentional concealment, etc. may not only affect the validity of the previous contract, but also face corresponding liability for breach of contract. For the losses that Lujiazui Group needs to bear, Lujiazui Group also has the right to recover from Suzhou Iron and Steel Group; in addition, if the appraisal agency investigates the case There are cases of fraudulent identification involving soil pollution, and they also face legal risks and liabilities. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;First, it will involve civil compensation risks, and may bear joint liability with Suzhou Steel and other entities; &lt;/span>;&lt;br>;&lt;span>;Second, it will face administrative The risk of punishment is that you may face administrative penalties such as warnings, fines, confiscation of illegal income, and revocation of corresponding qualifications;&lt;/span>;&lt;br>;&lt;span>;Third, if the circumstances are serious, the relevant responsible personnel may also be guilty of providing false certification documents, etc. Criminal offenses, criminal liability. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Zhou Zhengfeng, a lawyer at Guangdong Huashang Law Firm, also told reporters that if the investigation proves that the soil pollution involved in the case was falsified, Lujiazui may win the case. But the case may eventually be mediated. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Of course, in addition to the current lawsuit, this case will also require corresponding solutions in the future. Issues such as how to deal with developed land are more worthy of attention. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&lt;span>;Lujiazui behind the “poisonous land” case:&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;Revenue and net profit dropped&lt;/span>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In addition to paying attention to the case itself, the incident also caused netizens to worry about Lujiazui’s business conditions. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;As of November 8, Lujiazui’s market value was 44.76 billion yuan. Perhaps due to the huge impact of the case, the company’s stock price fell 0.75% that day to 9.30 yuan per share. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;“You can’t recover the cost even if you win the lawsuit” “The claim amount of 10 billion is equivalent to 22% of the market value” “Is there no money for development?” Some investors responded to the incident They have a negative attitude, believing that Lujiazui is also facing operating difficulties during the real estate downturn cycle; but some netizens also have a positive attitude, &quot;Lujiazui&#39;s attitude is not bad. Investors are more assured when such things happen and proactively disclose information.&quot; &quot;Lujiazui still has a conscience. No more false reports were issued to defraud property owners into purchasing their homes.&quot; &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>; Regarding whether the case will have an impact on the company’s operations, Lujiazui mentioned in an announcement on November 4 that the case is still in the filing and acceptance stage, and it is temporarily unable to judge whether it will affect the company’s operations. The impact on the company’s profits for the current period or subsequent periods. According to relevant media reports, Lujiazui Chairman Xu Erjin said at the performance briefing on November 6 that the company’s special working group is going all out to carry out disposal and rights protection work, and promote relevant responsible parties to assume subsequent disposal responsibilities. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Xu Erjin also emphasized at the performance meeting that in the future, the company will pay close attention to the market situation in the Yangtze River Delta, choose opportunities to participate, continue to actively support the integrated development and construction of the Yangtze River Delta, and continue to strengthen Optimize the company&#39;s main business. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Although the company still has confidence in investment, it is undeniable that from the data point of view, Lujiazui has experienced a continuous double decline in operating income and net profit. According to the financial report, in 2022, Lujiazui achieved revenue of 11.762 billion yuan, a year-on-year decrease of 15.21%; net profit was 1.085 billion yuan, a year-on-year decrease of 74.84%; revenue in the first three quarters of 2023 was approximately 5.775 billion yuan, a year-on-year decrease of 14.48%; attributable to listing The company&#39;s shareholders&#39; net profit was approximately 837 million yuan, a year-on-year decrease of 27.75%. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The decline in Lujiazui’s performance is not unrelated to the fact that the current real estate market is still at a trough. In the first three quarters of this year, the national real estate development investment was 8,726.9 billion yuan, a year-on-year decrease of 9.1%; the commercial housing sales area was 848.06 million square meters, a year-on-year decrease of 7.5%. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;“Land pollution has devalued, the real estate market has declined, and forced development is unprofitable.” Some people in the industry believe that the main reason for this case to surface is due to multiple factors Impact. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The emergence of this case also triggered a new round of discussion on land development in the real estate industry. &quot;In the past 20 years of working in the industry, I have never seen a lawsuit like the tens of billions of land withdrawals due to soil pollution.&quot; Zhang Hongwei, founder of Jingjian Consulting, said that the lawsuit has involved the two governments, so it is not easy to handle. However, the &quot;poisonous land&quot; has been delayed for seven years. It is hoped that through the coordination of relevant departments in Shanghai and Jiangsu, this problem can be fundamentally solved. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;易居研究院研究总监严跃进则猜测，该案件中或还涉及造假腐败等内容，显然需要严查。 “此事也说明，在房地产激进发展的一些年份，一些地块出让没有遵循规范，违规出让，进而产生了很多问题，对于人民群众合法权益造成了侵害。”他进一步指出，行业需要对工业用地的安全性问题提高重视，企业应该对于一些有工业用地开发历史的要审慎，防范产生后遗症。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;

&lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;母亲的魔力鞋。 &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（视觉中国/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;更早的时候，我说的是她生病之前，她穿阿珍卖的艾力沛魔力鞋。其实那时候她已经感到不舒服了。她昏昏欲睡、拉肚子和发烧。也许癌细胞正在她的身体里野蛮生长，只是无人知晓。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;她说那是双神奇的鞋子。一双卖两千两百块马币。阿珍允许她先把鞋子拿回家，试穿一段时间后再付钱。她很满意，也许还觉得自己占便宜了。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;于是她穿着它们出门，到镇上吃早餐，去商店买东西，还穿着去台湾参加她儿子的婚礼。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“我差点跌倒！”她曾对我说。不知道究竟是因为当时的她太虚弱了，还是那双鞋子导致她的脚很不好受。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我从来不在意那双鞋。那是个人们会相信豪猪枣、符水和降头术的地方。一双鞋子没什么大不了的。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但那不是普通的鞋子。阿珍说那是带有超能磁的能量保健鞋，鞋底藏有精心调配的中药，能开启人体第二心脏，激发人体自愈能量环。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“健康是穿出来的”，鞋子的纸袋上写着。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;等我见到那双鞋子时，她已经是一个骨瘦如柴，充满了怨毒的病人。她开始怨恨那双鞋子。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;说来吊诡，她的朋友秀丽也患癌症了。不过秀丽没有穿魔力鞋，她吃阿珍卖的胶原蛋白粉。她们俩每天都吃。那东西还挺麻烦的，得一起床就吃，而且越早吃越好。有一次，我们去西安旅游，天还没亮她就爬起来烧水沏胶原蛋白粉，喝完了就又回到床上睡觉。旅馆的烧水壶发出的嗡嗡声听得我和二姐心烦意乱。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;她不想见到那双鞋子，于是叫我和妹妹到阿珍的理发厅退货。那天她去理发了，不过她不去阿珍的理发厅，也不去楼下阿莲的理发厅。她独自撑伞走到后面商店楼上的理发厅。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我和妹妹硬着头皮走进阿珍的理发厅。阿珍一边替一个女人烫头发，一边和我们说话。她让我们看她和她女儿的鞋子。她们都穿着和母亲那双艾力沛魔力鞋一模一样的黑皮鞋。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“看，我和我女儿都穿，我一天到晚站着工作，脚一点都不酸！”阿珍说。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;鞋子当然退不了。 “都穿过了，谁还会买？”阿珍拒绝了我们。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;几天后，夏木来乌拉港，母亲给他看那双鞋子。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“我告诉你这双鞋子怎样骗人，你写下来，登在你们的报纸。”她对夏木说。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我和夏木面面相觑，然后看了一眼那双沉闷、丑陋的鞋子。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这就是她眼中的作家和记者应该做的事。她似乎分不清记者和作家的区别。在她看来，那都是读书人，是写字的人，应该用他们的笔替人发声，为民请命。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“我跟你讲，你写下来。”当她告诉我她生儿子差点丧命的遭遇时，她就是这么说的。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;她自己就是这样的人，热衷于伸张正义和替人说话，和她的丈夫完全相反。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;有一段时日，她除了忙裁缝铺的活儿，还忙着替过港的穷人申请救济金。她从市议会拿了一沓申请表，派给那些生活困顿的人。遇到不识马来文的人，她就请她的马来朋友帮忙填表格，因为她自己也不太懂马来文。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;她还给报馆打电话，替她的朋友申请报馆的救济金。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当她告诉我这些时，我对她的能耐与激情感到不可思议。我想起很久以前她说过的话。她说算命佬曾预言如果她继续上学的话，她会成为像李金狮那样的大人物。李金狮是我们从前的卫生部长。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;她很自豪。她像个乡绅，像个大人物那样在乌拉港走来走去。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;很快她的风光就烟消云散。她怨恨魔力鞋，怨恨她的妹妹，怨恨欺骗她的人。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在第一次化疗的前一晚，在医院附近的酒店里，凌晨时分，在把晚餐全都吐出来后，她对我娓娓道来一个女人的故事。那个女人通过她的帮助获得了救济金，但她发现原来她并不穷，她和她的丈夫在离乌拉港不远的镇子经营海产的生意。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“我还有她们的名片。”她说。她决定打电话给报馆揭发那个女人。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;不到一个月，她自己就成了等待被救济的人。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;父亲说她可以申请救济金，她应该领救济金。于是市议会的人来了。那个男人也是母亲的朋友，一直以来就是他在处理母亲代人递交的申请表。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;阿兹敏带着深深的理解与悲悯看着母亲。他当下就作出了决定，建议我为母亲拍张照片。母亲得躺在床上，这样才能将她的病态完完全全地展露出来。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我没有为母亲照相。夏木也没有为她写揭露骗局的报道。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;很久以后，在她死了五年后，我才想到应该上网搜搜关于魔力鞋的介绍或新闻。我很快就看到了《南方都市报》的报道。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;那是2016年的报道。那时她还没有生病。那时我还在学校教书。两年后，我不再是个老师，她成了一个注定会死去的病人。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当她让我们看那双鞋时，为什么我们没有想到应该上网搜一搜？这不是我们这些读书人的本能和本领吗？ &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;也许我并不在乎她花了多少钱买一双鞋子。也许我早已对她上当的事实司空见惯。那是一个人们相信豪猪枣、符水和降头术的地方。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我尊重他人的信仰与生活，我总是这样说。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我已经离开乌拉港很久了。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“我们不需要救济金。”我们这几个孩子都这么想。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我没有为母亲照相。再说了，母亲也不情愿躺在床上，任由人为她拍下一张耻辱与绝望的照片。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在她死后，一个周日午后，二姐把那双魔力鞋退还给了阿珍。她用葬礼收到的帛金付给阿珍两千两百马币。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在她死后，我在她的抽屉里发现了一张剪报。那是2014年11月29日的《星洲日报》关于“情在人间”助养儿童计划的新闻。剪报上有五个六年级学生的肖像，报道的标题是《以好成绩回报助养人，星洲助养学生UPSR获佳绩》。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我还以为那都是过港的孩子，是她曾经帮助过的孩子。不是。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我知道为什么她收藏那张剪报。她喜欢这样的故事，那些关于奋斗、苦尽甘来和知恩图报的故事。曾经她的孩子也凭借优秀的成绩而获得社会的支持，她引以为傲，丝毫没有因为那里面深深隐藏着卑微的气息而面红耳赤。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;那双魔力鞋或许此刻就在某个女人的脚上。我们也不再提起那些往事。但我从来没有忘记它们。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;过去我没有做一个女儿能够（应该？）做的事，于是现在我做一个作家应该做的事。 &lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;南都湾财社记者注意到，上述通报案例中，地方政府要求国有企业垫资建设新增隐性债务的现象屡见不鲜。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;以陕西西安为例，通报披露，2019年8月至2020年12月，依据西安市政府专项问题会议决定，西安国际会议中心等项目建设资金由市、区两级财政承担。西安世园投资（集团）有限公司以西安国际会展中心展览馆等3个项目建设的名义向交通银行股份有限公司陕西省分行等5家银行贷款70亿元。截至2021年6月末，项目实际提款61.5亿元，其中26亿元用于西安国际会议中心项目建设支出，形成新增隐性债务26亿元。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;中共陕西省纪律检查委员会、陕西省监察委员会依纪依规组织对相关责任人予以问责。对时任西安市市长上官某某给予党内警告处分；对时任西安市副市长李某给予批评教育，并责令在年度民主生活会上作出说明和检查；对时任西安浐灞生态区管理委员会主任门某给予批评教育，并责令在年度民主生活会上作出说明和检查；对时任西安市财政局局长杨某给予党内警告处分；对时任西安市财政局局长李某某给予政务记过处分；对其他相关人员一并进行了处理。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;再比如四川成都彭州，2021年1月，依据彭州市委、彭州市政府有关会议决定，以及彭州市濛阳新城建设领导小组办公室印发的《彭州市濛阳新城片区开发投资合作实施方案》，彭州市政府授权彭州市国有资产经营管理有限公司作为濛阳新城片区综合开发城市综合运营商，开展区域内基础设施、地产开发等项目的投资、融资、开发、建设及运营工作，并承诺以预期土地出让收入等作为项目投资回报来源。截至2021年9月末，该公司累计筹集资金4.32亿元用于新城片区建设，形成新增隐性债务4.32亿元。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;中共四川省纪律检查委员会、四川省监察委员会依纪依规组织对相关责任人予以问责。对时任彭州市委书记王某某给予诫勉；对时任彭州市委副书记、市长陈某某给予诫勉；对时任彭州市委副书记、濛阳新城建设领导小组组长张某某给予党内警告处分；对时任彭州市副市长、濛阳新城建设领导小组副组长胡某某给予诫勉；对时任彭州市副市长、濛阳新城建设领导小组副组长龚某某给予诫勉；对时任彭州市财政局党组书记、局长周某某给予警告处分；对时任彭州市发展和改革局党组书记、局长，濛阳新城建设领导小组副组长马某给予党内警告处分；对时任彭州市国有资产经营管理有限公司董事长覃某某给予诫勉；对其他相关人员一并进行了处理。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;值得一提的是，今年6月26日，审计署向全国人大常委会作《关于2022年度中央预算执行和其他财政收支的审计工作报告》中也提及这一现象，在审计的54个地区中，有49个地区通过承诺兜底回购、国有企业垫资建设等方式，违规新增隐性债务415.16亿元。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot;

&lt;p>;这件事发生的时间，司马迁声明过不在《史记》的覆盖范围之内。即使是一百多年以后的班固，大概因为实在太敏感，也故意不把话说得太清楚，《汉书》在涉及的人物传记里，讲得东一嘴西一嘴的，拼起来才能看出个大概。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;有个叫江充的人，疯狂诬陷太子，罪名是太子在用巫蛊之术诅咒汉武帝。太子没办法，只好起兵造反。汉武帝让丞相刘屈氂指挥军队和太子在长安城里大战，死了好几万人。太子战败逃走，最终在外面死掉了。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;司马迁有两个好朋友卷入了这件事。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一个是任安，他当时是“监北军使者”，掌控着长安城里规模最大的一支军队。太子造反的时候，曾发兵符想调任安出兵，结果任安接了兵符后，来个闭门不出。这事被汉武帝认为“怀二心”，所以任安被汉武帝腰斩。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一个是田仁，他是丞相府司直（丞相府属官，负责监察不法，秩比二千石，属于高级官员），当时被分派去看守长安城南最东边的覆盎门。太子逃到这个门来，他让太子逃掉了。这个罪行当然更严重，也是腰斩。连开始替田仁求情的人，被汉武帝一责问，都吓得自杀了。&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;司马光的版本：奸人离间父子之情&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;司马迁当时就在汉武帝身边做中书令，但也只能眼睁睁看着朋友被处死，不敢多说什么话。其实《史记》里也有些极零碎的巫蛊案的记录，基本不讲事情本身，主要是涉案人员的结局之类。这些内容司马迁所写还是后人所补，一直众说纷纭。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;到了一千多年后的宋朝，司马光写《资治通鉴》时，在班固那个梗概的基础上，终于提供给我们一份关于巫蛊事件的首尾完整、逻辑严密、情理圆融、冲突强烈、细节丰赡的叙述。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这个故事讲的是一个雄才大略但比较残暴的父皇，和不那么有才能但很善良的太子的冲突。汉武帝希望在自己生前，把最棘手的事情都做完，留下一个需要休养生息的国家交给儿子去治理。这样刚好是最完美的组合。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但是，那些专门帮助汉武帝去执行残暴任务的人知道，一旦太子即位，自己就完了。所以他们千方百计去破坏这个计划，这里面最凶恶的，就是那个江充。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;汉武帝一次次希望和儿子达成谅解，但是奸臣和小人们却一边把太子往绝路上逼，一边传递给汉武帝错误的信息。终于大祸酿成。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;知道真相后，汉武帝惩办了奸臣，作思子宫，表达了对太子的思念。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这是个非常哀婉动人，还很有教育意义的故事。设想一下，以班固的性格，如果能读到这个一千年后的故事，大概也是会表示赞赏，而不是去戳穿他。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;最近这些年，许多介绍汉武帝的书和电视节目，都是在司马光这个故事的基础上讲述的。有人甚至进一步延伸，比如把司马迁加进这个故事里来。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;然后，这个奸人离间父子之情的版本，虽然可爱，但恐怕不可信。下文我们以史料为依据，结合对权力运作与人性的理解，抽丝剥茧，把巫蛊之祸的真相尽可能呈现出来。&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;刘髆：在刘据与刘弗陵之间&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;我们从汉武帝的儿子说起。汉武帝六个儿子，为了介绍他们，班固写了《武五子传》，司马迁写了《三王世家》。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;《武五子传》写了汉武帝的五个儿子，这是自然不过的。因为还有一个儿子就是汉昭帝，他继承了皇位，自然不应该和其他人放在一起。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;《三王世家》只写了三个儿子，这就有点奇怪；而且这篇的内容也很不正常，只是抄录册封三位皇子为诸侯王时的相关文件而已。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;为什么会这个样子，当然有很多争论。但《三王世家》这个题目，是司马迁自己定的，没有疑问。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这篇写到的三位：汉武帝的次子齐王刘闳，三子燕王刘旦，四子广陵王刘胥。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;没写到的三位是：长子卫太子刘据，五子昌邑王刘髆，幼子后来的汉昭帝刘弗陵。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;简单的解释，前三位是元狩六年（公元前117年）同一天封王的，不涉及其他人。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但也可以作复杂点的猜想：班固是东汉人，自然清楚谁继位当了皇帝；司马迁是汉武帝时代的当事人，他写作《三王世家》的时候，不写的三个人，都有继承皇位的可能的，把谁写进世家来都不合适；即使写进来的三位，很多话也不方便说，只有抄抄公文，才是安全的。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在很多人看来，只有刘据和刘弗陵才是重要的。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;长子刘据出生于元朔元年（公元前128年），很长时间里被视为理所当然的皇位继承人。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;幼子刘弗陵出生于太始三年（公元前94年），最后摘取了皇位竞争的胜利果实。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;昌邑王刘髆的年纪，大致是比刘据小二十来岁又比刘弗陵大十几岁。 关于他的信息，即使在《汉书》当中都是近乎空白的。有人因为这大块的空白，认为汉武帝从来不重视他。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但空白也可能是因为敏感。毕竟，刘髆的母亲，是汉武帝最爱的女人李夫人，刘髆的舅舅，就是汉武帝疯狂给他砸资源和提供机会的李广利。还有，刘髆死的时间也很敏感，《汉书》不同的地方说法微有差异，反正要么是汉武帝临死前，要么是汉昭帝刚即位。&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“金屋藏娇”实为政治婚姻&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;抛开“金屋藏娇”之类的民间八卦，只以《史记》《汉书》作依据，很容易得出这样的结论：汉武帝和他的第一个皇后陈氏，完全是政治婚姻。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;陈皇后的母亲馆陶长公主，是汉景帝的姐姐，窦太后的女儿，拥有巨大的政治影响力。可以说，汉景帝的这些儿子，谁娶了馆陶长公主的女儿，谁就获得了重要加分项。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;汉武帝的母亲非常聪明地抓住机会，促成了这门亲事。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;汉武帝即位初期，大权在奶奶窦太后手里，因为一次冒失的政治改革汉武帝几乎被废。他能够保住帝位，也和长公主有关。因为老太太最喜欢的就是这个女儿（所以后来“遗诏尽以东宫金钱财物赐长公主嫖”），她可以不稀罕这个孙子（反正有一大堆），但不能太伤害女儿的女婿（如果女儿、外孙女对他很满意的话）。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;所以后来馆陶长公主可以很干脆地说：“帝非我不得立。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;也就是说，汉武帝有一段时间，可以说是在陈皇后的庇护之下的。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;乾纲独断之后，对汉武帝这样一个雄才大略心高气傲的皇帝来说，恐怕想起这段往事，不是感恩，而是屈辱。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;陈皇后偏偏完全不理解皇帝的心理不照顾皇帝的情绪。《史记》说她“骄贵”，《汉书》说她“擅宠骄贵”，这个宠恐怕不是宠爱的意思，而是地位高的意思。因为汉武帝的性格显然是，你因为我的宠爱骄纵一点，那没有关系；你仗着自己的地位骄纵，那就非常严重了。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;所以皇后被废是早晚的问题，废皇后的那个案子，也要让张汤这样的酷吏来从重判刑，极力株连。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;《史记》里介绍汉武帝的皇后，居然一上来就是卫子夫，然后用插叙的手法，告诉大家汉武帝还有过一位陈皇后，这体现的是汉武帝时代的氛围。《汉书》才老老实实按照时间顺序，孝武陈皇后、孝武卫皇后这么写下来。&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;太子刘据挺过第一轮挑战&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;按照《史记》的说法，汉武帝对第二个皇后卫子夫的宠爱，似乎也不过如此。在特定的环境下突然看见，特别喜欢，然后带进宫里，然后居然有一年多把她忘掉了。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但卫子夫无疑是汉武帝的福星。她给汉武帝带来了三个女儿，一个儿子，但更重要的是还有卫青、霍去病两位耀眼的名将。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;开始的时候，卫青因为是皇后卫子夫的弟弟，才获得了带兵打仗的机会；但没过几年，大概就变成了因为是大将军卫青的姐姐，卫子夫的皇后地位才没有被撼动了。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;卫青武功赫赫，无可替代；卫青又柔媚低调，善于和各方面处好关系。元朔六年（公元前123年），卫青挟两次大胜匈奴之余威，低声下气地把皇帝给他的赏赐拿出一半来，给汉武帝所宠爱的王夫人的双亲祝寿。显然，王夫人已经对卫子夫的地位构成了强有力的挑战。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;王夫人得宠的这些年，司马迁正在宫里做郎官。后来王夫人去世，齐地的方士少翁为汉武帝召唤王夫人的魂魄，司马迁也是近距离观察到的。王夫人有多么被宠爱，他显然印象特别深。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;王夫人也是生不逢时，她在汉武帝心中的地位，也许已经超越了卫子夫，但她得宠的年代，正是卫青、霍去病对汉武帝来说不可或缺的时代。元狩六年（公元前117年），霍去病赶在自己去世之前，请求汉武帝封太子以外的三位皇子为王，汉武帝答应了。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;司马迁以“好奇”著称，但写到汉武帝后宫的那点事，他嘴巴算相当严。所以有些细节要靠别人补：当时王夫人生病，汉武帝问她，你想我把你儿子封到哪里？王夫人说洛阳，汉武帝说洛阳是真不行，“关东之国无大于齐者。齐东负海而城郭大，古时独临菑中十万户，天下膏腴地莫盛于齐者矣”，就让你儿子做齐王吧。王夫人去世后，汉武帝还特别给了她一个齐国王太后的身份。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;如果褚少孙补的这段可信，王夫人提出把洛阳封给儿子，那若不是觉悟太低，那就分明是怄气；汉武帝则对王夫人似乎有些亏欠愧疚的样子，或许曾经答应过她什么但没能兑现。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;无论如何，卫子夫和太子刘据挺过了第一轮挑战。&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“倾城倾国”的李夫人&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;接下来李夫人最得宠的那几年，大致就是元封年间（前110年~前105年），司马迁在这期间结束了郎官生涯做太史令去了，和宫里的事拉开了一点距离。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;从《史记》看不出李夫人受宠的程度。但班固写到李夫人，八卦的心简直要炸裂了：&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;第一，班固说，汉武帝先赏识的是李夫人的哥哥李延年。李延年唱了这样一支歌：“北方有佳人，绝世而独立，一顾倾人城，再顾倾人国。宁不知倾城与倾国，佳人难再得！”汉武帝听了很感叹，说世上真有这么美的人吗。于是汉武帝的姐姐平阳公主（卫子夫也是她推荐的，这算她的职业）就向汉武帝推荐了李夫人。从此汉武帝宠爱得不得了。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;第二，班固说，李夫人病重，汉武帝来看她。李夫人把自己蒙在被子里，说我病重很久了，“形貌毁坏”，不可以见皇帝，我的心愿就是皇帝能照顾好我的儿子和兄弟。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;汉武帝非常想见一见李夫人的脸，李夫人就是不肯，最后汉武帝很生气地走了。李夫人的姐妹责怪她，干吗这么惹皇帝生气？李夫人说，我不让皇帝看我现在的样子，是为我的兄弟好，“夫以色事人者，色衰而爱弛，爱弛则恩绝”，见不到现在的我，皇帝会一直记得我最美的样子；见到现在的我，那只会从此嫌弃我了。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这个经典案例，经常被引用。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;第三，少翁召唤王夫人魂魄的那个故事，被班固拿过来安在了李夫人身上。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;第四，班固说，见到李夫人魂魄之后，“上又自为作赋，以伤悼夫人”。这是一首很长也有很多难懂字词的作品，这里就不抄了。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;八卦故事是所有人都有可能编的，替帝王写爱情诗，也是很多文人的爱好，所以班固所记的以上四点，断言是真的或者断言是假的，都很冒险。但还是那句话，关于李夫人的段子这么多，正说明人们心目中，李夫人才是汉武帝心目中最重要的女人。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;而且，如果说上面的事真假存疑，那下面这两件事，班固这种级别的历史学家是绝对不会胡来的：一是李夫人去世后，“上以后礼葬焉”，她是皇后之礼下葬的；二是汉武帝去世后，霍光知道皇帝的想法，“以李夫人配食，追上尊号曰孝武皇后”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;李夫人被当作皇后看待，那她的儿子应该是什么？&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;还有就是那首“倾国倾城”的歌，怎么听都像是带着谶语的味道。众所周知，中国的史书有个特点，谶语可以是胡编的，但既然把这个预言写下来了，它就是会应验的。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;那么李夫人倒是造成了什么灾难性后果，才配得上倾国倾城这么一个谶语？当然只有巫蛊之祸了。&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;卫氏外戚的凋零&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;其实在《汉书》里，班固另外留下了许多的蛛丝马迹，而这些记录，刚好是能和司马迁对之前的历史的叙述，完美衔接的。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;下面让我们回到庸俗的宫斗剧情。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;比起王夫人，李夫人有个最大的幸运：不是卫子夫更加年老色衰了，而是卫青、霍去病这两个障碍已经不存在了。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;霍去病于元狩六年（前117年）去世，卫青虽然活到元封五年（前106年），但后来一直没有带过兵。因为元鼎、元封年间，汉武帝面对的对手，已经不再是巅峰状态的匈奴。类似南越、东越、朝鲜这样的敌人，其他的将军们也足以控制局面。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但这不意味着障碍完全扫除，现在活跃的将军们也和卫青、霍去病关系密切。卫青带出来十几个将军，霍去病培养了两个。灭东越发挥重要作用的横海将军韩说，灭朝鲜的将军荀彘，还有公孙贺、公孙敖等人，当年都在卫青麾下。灭南越的主将路博德，生擒楼兰王的赵破奴，出自霍去病系统。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;可见，所谓卫青不养士大夫，主要是指不养长安城里的名嘴、活动家还有游侠之类，打了这么多年仗，在军队里杀伐决断，当然还是要培养自己的班底的。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;值得注意的还有李广家族，尽管李广之死被认为和卫青有关，李广的儿子李敢更据信是死于霍去病之手，但是李、卫两家，还是迅速修复了关系。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;李广的堂弟李蔡，是因为跟着卫青打仗，才拿到侯爵的；甚至李敢本人能够“赐爵关内侯”，也是在霍去病麾下。然后李敢的女儿成了卫太子宠爱的女人，李敢的儿子李禹也是卫太子宠信的部下。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这些人算一个政治集团吗？汉武帝在，太子的地位不动摇，就不算是，因为他们之间的关系也错综复杂矛盾重重；但如果汉武帝换太子了，他们就是：因为新太子要有新班底，他们就要给人家腾位子。就像当年，萧何、曹参之间的矛盾曾经很大，但一旦刘邦想废掉汉惠帝改立赵王刘如意，他们就又是在同一条战壕里的老兄弟。&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;李氏外戚不争气&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;以下是我根据上述史料拟合的一个推测：&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;元封（前110年~前105年）间的某一年，李夫人去世，从此以一个最美丽的形象，定格于汉武帝心中。汉武帝心中，李夫人才是皇后，他于是想改立昌邑王刘髆为太子。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;汉武帝此时五十岁上下，精力或许已经不如当年，但无疑更加深谋远虑手腕老辣。这么重大的事情，他不会急于表态，甚至于想法都不会流露出来多少。那会直接导致原来的军政体系失灵，无论如何是不值得的。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;太初元年（公元前104年），李广利被任命为贰师将军，指挥了一场耗时四年、使得全国上下都超负荷运转的战争。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当然，战争是本来就要打的，但由李广利来指挥，说是“欲侯宠姬李氏”，还是说得轻了。只是想让李广利封侯，让他和赵破奴这样的将军合作，打一场类似征楼兰这样轻松的战争，封侯的理由就足够了。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但李广利的指挥部里，赵始成、李哆、上官桀这些人的来历虽然不很清楚，但反正就是没有卫青、霍去病麾下的老将。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;汉武帝在想培养一个由李广利主导的，和卫青、霍去病无关的新的军功集体。这样将来即使换太子，也不会引起太大震动。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但李广利实在太不争气，征大宛是得不偿失的惨胜，打匈奴是一次又一次的惨败。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当然，今天的研究者可能会认为李广利的能力也没有那么不堪。后世的经验表明，中原王朝的力量向西推进的极限，就是帕米尔高原东麓，李广利征大宛超出了这个极限。和匈奴作战，此时的局势也和卫青霍去病时代完全不同。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这个时代，汉朝的战略优势，对匈奴人来说是无解的，所以匈奴再怎么打胜仗都还是在寻求与汉朝和谈；但匈奴的战术优势对汉朝来说也几乎是无解的：征大宛之后，汉朝战马紧缺的问题不是缓解了而是极大加剧了，匈奴人的机动优势变得更大，所以面对出征的汉军，只需要躲避，窥探，跟踪……等到你不得不撤退，已经临近家乡也是最精疲力竭的时候，突然发动致命一击。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;所以对汉朝来说最明智的选择就是防守，看着中原一天天好起来、匈奴一天天坏下去就可以了。但只要远距离出征，换其他将领也没什么好结果。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但这些说法今天也不见得大家都会接受，汉朝人更不会这么想，还是拿李广利和卫青、霍去病比较，抚昔伤今比较符合人性。哪怕是当年看不上卫、霍的，现在的心理，也是“不需上溯文景世，回首获麟已惘然”吧？&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;汉武帝也在渐渐失去耐心。皇帝对一个女人的追恋，能维持这么久，已经是一个奇迹了。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;天汉四年（前97年）春，李广利又一次征匈奴无功，夏，刘髆被封为昌邑王。虽然不能说这就是名分已定，但终究不是好兆头。&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;刘弗陵出生与“尧母门”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;太始三年（前94年），钩弋赵婕妤为六十三岁的汉武帝又生了一个小皇子刘弗陵。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;讲到钩弋夫人赵婕妤的故事，班固又开始放飞八卦的心：汉武帝巡狩过河间郡的时候，不是官吏而是“望气者”发现了这个奇女子。她的双手天生握成拳头无法张开，汉武帝就上去摸了摸，哇，美少女的手掌张开了。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这些都是班固清清楚楚写在《汉书•外戚传》里的，和《汉武故事》里的相关内容几乎一模一样。《汉武故事》假托是班固的作品，固然不可信，但要认为班固写的都是严谨精密的历史，其余作品都是荒诞不经的小说，截然对立起来，也是不现实的。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;然后，赵婕妤怀刘弗陵的时间，据说长达十四个月。汉武帝说，听说尧也是在妈妈肚子里待了十四个月才生的。于是就把赵婕妤居住的地方，宫门命名为“尧母门”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;尧可是上古圣王啊，把天下治理得那么好，当今世上居然又诞生了一个尧，不让他当皇帝，你不觉得可惜吗？&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这个地方，司马迁其实倒是蛮配合汉武帝的。关于尧的传说很多，《史记》采信的版本是，尧是帝喾的小儿子，挤掉了自己的全部哥哥继承了天子之位。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;总之，李夫人这颗当年心头的朱砂痣虽然还不至于变成蚊子血，但确实有一缕新鲜的白月光，照进了皇帝的生活。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;所以，这时候紧张的不只有卫子夫和太子，也有命运和外甥牢牢绑定在一起的李广利。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;往前看，太子的背影好像越来越远，往后看，那个当代唐尧正在快速逼近。要想不被后面那个人追上，最好是赶紧追上前面那个人。&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;赵地老乡走得近？&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;方诗铭先生是特别善于根据人物籍贯发现政治集团的前辈学者，传统社会里，人与人之间的关系，除掉血缘就是老乡特别重要。这个方法当然不绝对正确，但是确实能解释不少问题。他有一篇论文梳理出这样一条线索：&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;李夫人、李广利家是“中山故倡”，中山是被赵地包围着的，《史记•货殖列传》介绍天下风俗，也是把赵和中山放在一起说的。所以中山人和赵人，都是家乡人。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;那么再看巫蛊之祸中，逼死太子的过程里发挥重要作用的人物有哪些：&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;首先就是丞相刘屈氂，他是汉武帝的兄弟中山靖王刘胜的儿子——史书上那么多“中山靖王刘胜之后”，很难得，这个是真的。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;诸侯王的儿子到朝廷来做大官，其实是很不容易的事。《汉书》说“不知其始所以进”，但又告诉我们，刘屈氂和李广利不但是中山老乡，而且是儿女亲家。（《刘屈氂传》）&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;长安城里驻扎着胡人骑兵，汉武帝父子开战的时候，谁能得到这支军队的支持，就赢得了关键的筹码。帮助汉武帝杀掉太子的使者，夺得这支军队的指挥权的人，叫马通，也就是东汉伏波将军马援的曾祖父，是不久前，刚刚从赵国的邯郸搬到茂陵来居住的。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;而且在对匈奴的战场上，马通和李广利协同作战，关系很密切。（《汉书•匈奴传》）&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;马通的哥哥马何罗，则和江充是好朋友。（《汉书•金日磾传》）&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当然还有咬太子咬得最凶，冲锋在最前列的江充，他也是邯郸人，而且他们家的特点和中山李氏一样，也是以歌舞见长的。众所周知，演艺圈里有自己独特的关系网。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;反正可以肯定的是，征和二年（前91年）逼死了太子，征和三年（前90年）李广利又率军出击匈奴，走到渭桥，李广利就对送行的刘屈氂说：“愿君侯早请昌邑王为太子。如立为帝，君侯长何忧乎？”这场大灾难，他们是受益者。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但也就在这一年，有人向汉武帝举报，刘屈氂的妻子在行巫蛊诅咒皇帝。汉武帝派有关部门调查审理，认为“罪至大逆不道”，于是刘屈氂全家族灭。在前方和匈奴作战的李广利听到了消息，知道回汉朝也是死罪，也就投降了匈奴。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这件事，听起来像是刘屈氂的妻子脑子进水。但事实可能是汉武帝知道了太子是被他们陷害的。但陷害太子的事归罪于江充没问题，归罪于丞相和贰师将军，一系列宫廷内幕勾心斗角都会揭发出来，连带滋生无数谣言，所以另找理由把他们收拾了，反正此时巫蛊这个罪名，就像今天说贪污一样，基本是百发百中。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这也不是臆测，实际上班固又是写到了的，后元元年（前88年），汉武帝身体已经快垮了，不经意间说了实话：&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;上报曰：“朕之不德，自左丞相（刘屈氂）与贰师（李广利）阴谋逆乱，巫蛊之祸流及士大夫……”（《汉书•车千秋传》）&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“阴谋逆乱”如果是指刘屈氂行巫蛊，那此事并没有“流及士大夫”，只有理解为指他们陷害太子，才是合理的。颜师古注释《汉书》的时候，也是这么理解的。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这么看来，这场太子和皇后丧命，几万人陪葬（《汉书》原文：“僵尸数万”），喋血京师的大灾难，策划者实际上是李夫人的哥哥李广利。按照“红颜祸水”的逻辑，当然确乎是应验了李夫人“倾国倾城”了。&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;卫太子是一个什么样的人&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;比较容易判断的，是《汉书》里的卫太子形象和《资治通鉴》确实不一样。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;《资治通鉴》说，太子“仁恕温谨”，“敦重好静”，这个形象《汉书》里是不存在的；“群臣宽厚长者皆附太子”这个局面，也和《汉书》的记述完全不符。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;《汉书》里对卫太子的介绍，最重要的就是这句话：&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;上为立博望苑，使通宾客，从其所好，故多以异端进者。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;太子身边聚集着一大批绝不安分的人。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;所以事实上太子的团队行动能力相当强。觉得要被汉武帝的使者陷害，立刻就能做出反应，能抓的抓，该杀的杀，一点也不含糊。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;然后组织武装力量也算相当有效率：太子抢占了长安城的武库，武装自己的宾客；调动皇后卫子夫居住的长乐宫的力量；再释放长安城的囚徒颁给武器。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;此外差点调动成功的还有：一、屯驻在长安东南的长水骑兵和屯驻于长安西南的宣曲骑兵；二、任安的北军。按照《汉书》的描写，汉武帝和卫太子对这两支队伍的争夺，输赢成败也真可谓电光石火一瞬间事：马通稍微晚到一步，太子的手下如侯（此人身份居然是个囚徒）就能调走胡人骑兵；任安是做过太子少傅的，他对太子的忠诚稍微再多一点点，就不会置身事外。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;要不是早就对起兵造反做过预案，对长安城可以利用的军事力量做过深入全面的调查分析，有详尽的计划周密的部署，恐怕很难想象有这样的行动效率。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;即使失去了这两支劲旅，太子的军队仍然形成了很强的战斗力。汉武帝平叛的军队，应该是以郎中令、卫尉的精锐为骨干，配备着汉朝最尖端的令匈奴也心惊胆战的各种类型的弓弩（所以汉武帝强调不要近战），加上三辅的地方部队，可就是这样也大战了五天。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;总之，反应之敏捷，行动之迅速，作战之强悍，都表明卫太子不是人善被人欺的角色。和传说要造反却束手无策的淮南王刘安相比，刘安真应该发明一块豆腐把自己撞死。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;班固对太子还作了一番很有意思的评论。太子出生，“蚩尤之旗见，其长竟天”，所谓“蚩尤之旗”，是指天上拖着长长尾巴的彗星，古人认为这是兵戈灾祸的象征。汉朝对匈奴的战争开始了，太子出生了。之后仗一打就是三十年，“兵所诛屠夷灭死者不可胜数”，再然后就是这场京城里的大战乱。所以“太子生长于兵，与之终始”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;本来读这句话，也只是让人觉得，班固在暗示：太子代表战火和杀意。公布的《清华简·五纪》中的一句话，才让人豁然开朗：“黄帝有子曰蚩尤，既长成人，乃作为五兵。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;班固明明是在说，太子就是蚩尤的化身。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;而《史记》里关于太子的只言片语，也看不出司马迁对太子任何亲近感。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;庸俗地想，太子和汉武帝决战长安的时候，司马迁大概还是宁可汉武帝获胜的，哪怕就是为了自己活命。他此时是汉武帝的中书令，说难听点就是帮助皇帝处理行政事务的一个宦官，如果太子赢，皇帝身边玉石俱焚，司马迁多半也跑不掉。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;司马迁的朋友任安、田仁也不是严格意义上的太子党。田仁可以算忠于太子的，但他的职务却是丞相府的官员（要按照谍战剧的思维来理解，更应该说太子是个厉害人物了）；任安更可疑，接了太子的兵符不发兵，汉武帝说他“怀二心”，其实就是承认他并不算太子的人，而且也是雄猜之主对臣子要求高，照一般人看来，那个时候按兵不动，还是偏向皇帝多一些的。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;其他和太子有关的人物：&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;司马迁对卫青、霍去病的印象，众所周知是不好的。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;太子的老师石德，被有的学者拿来做“群臣宽厚长者皆附太子”的论据。其实司马迁对石德是有评价的：石家的祖上，能力才学不行，就是做人谨慎的品德很厉害，等到石德的爸爸去世之后，他们家“孝谨益衰矣”。这就离说石德一无是处不远了。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;还有李广的孙子，“敢男禹有宠于太子，然好利，李氏陵迟衰微矣”，被太子宠信的李禹，在司马迁眼里是个庸俗的财迷，更是他敬爱的飞将军李广的不肖子孙。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;太子和汉武帝之间矛盾爆发，说穿了就是两派政治势力的斗争而已，不存在什么“两条路线之争”，也没有什么道义和理想可言。只是逼到了这一步了，谁也退缩不得，争的既是至高无上的皇权，也是最卑微的生存。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这么说，司马迁不写巫蛊之祸，也不妨给一个文学性的解释：他那支豪情慷慨英雄气贯注的笔，没有办法面对这个时代。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;他笔下的太初之前的汉武帝时代，固然也充斥着凶暴与血污，但也豪杰辈出俊采星驰，哪怕他所憎恶的那些卑鄙无耻的人物，也精神昂扬气象恢廓，这种余晖，照耀进天汉年间，但到了太始、征和，就真的只剩下令人窒息的疯狂和算计了。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;不是因为哪个人死了世界才变了，而是今夜的寒风，吹落昨夜的星辰，那漫天的星斗，就是自然而然又无可挽回的黯淡了下去。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;从这个角度说，倒是宁可司马光讲的那个故事是真的，显得好歹有一点理想和亲情的温度吧。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;

At the same time, new research has found that the simplest way to prevent the early onset or younger onset of Alzheimer&#39;s disease is to have a good night&#39;s sleep. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On January 31, 2023, Jia Jianping’s team at Xuanwu Hospital reported in the Journal of Alzheimer’s Disease that a patient developed memory impairment at the age of 17 and was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease at the age of 19. (AD) patients. This is the youngest patient to date. The patient suffered from memory loss, frequently lost personal belongings, could not remember whether he had eaten or not, and was ultimately unable to complete his studies and had to drop out of high school. Previously, patients younger than 30 years old have been reported, with the youngest age of onset being 21 years old. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the process of diagnosis and treatment of the patient, the research team found that the patient&#39;s main symptom was memory decline, especially episodic memory decline. Combined with the Wechsler Memory Scale and Auditory Word Learning Test assessment, the patient&#39;s main symptoms were memory decline, especially episodic memory decline. A diagnosis was made. However, the patient had no family history of hereditary disease and could not find other causes of memory impairment such as genetics, infections, and systemic diseases. After whole-genome sequencing, it was found that the patient did not carry any risk or pathogenic gene mutations, ruling out the possibility of familial Alzheimer&#39;s disease. Therefore, its pathogenesis requires further study. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, Alzheimer’s disease is not exclusive to the elderly, but young people can also get it. Currently, there are at least 50 million dementia patients worldwide, and it is expected that the number will reach 152 million by 2050, of which about 60%-70% are Alzheimer&#39;s disease patients. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Research on Alzheimer&#39;s disease has long been classified. The disease has a youthful form, but this is not an independent disease. Alzheimer&#39;s disease is classified according to the age at onset. A standard and a title. Alzheimer&#39;s disease is divided into early-onset Alzheimer&#39;s disease (also known as young-onset Alzheimer&#39;s disease) and late-onset Alzheimer&#39;s disease. Early-onset Alzheimer&#39;s disease refers to Alzheimer&#39;s disease that occurs in adults between the ages of 18 and 64, and those younger than 35 are called very early-onset Alzheimer&#39;s disease. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Age statistics of Alzheimer&#39;s disease patients in various countries around the world show that the average age of onset of the disease is 51 years old. Young-onset Alzheimer&#39;s disease accounts for 4%-6% of Alzheimer&#39;s disease. However, most cases of young-onset Alzheimer&#39;s disease develop between the ages of 45 and 65. Statistics in the United States show that the mortality rate of young-onset Alzheimer&#39;s disease among those aged 40-64 is 24.2%. Now, the 19-year-old patient diagnosed with Alzheimer&#39;s disease in China belongs to the ultra-early form. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Insight Report on the Needs of Alzheimer&#39;s Disease Patients&quot; released by the National Health Commission on September 20, 2023 pointed out that there are currently about 15.07 million dementia patients in China aged 60 and above, among which Alzheimer&#39;s patients There are 9.83 million patients with Alzheimer&#39;s disease, and it is expected that by 2050, the number of Alzheimer&#39;s patients will exceed 40 million. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As the prevalence of Alzheimer&#39;s disease continues to rise in China, this disease, which mainly affects people over 60 years old, has shown a new characteristic in China. The incidence of Alzheimer&#39;s disease is increasing among young people in China. . Reported statistics show that the incidence of Alzheimer&#39;s disease is 2.5% for those under 40 years old; 4.1% for 40-49 year olds; 14.7% for 50-59 year olds; 28.9% for 60-69 year olds; and 70-79 year olds. 33.2%; 16.6% for those aged 80 and above. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It can be seen that the high-risk group of the disease is 60-79 years old, accounting for 62.1%. Alzheimer&#39;s disease is said to have early onset when it occurs under the age of 60. In China, 21.3% of patients with Alzheimer&#39;s disease are under the age of 60. Compared with the international incidence rate of 5%-10% in this age group, China&#39;s early-onset incidence rate has increased significantly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Whether it is China or the United Nations standards, people under 50 years old are middle-aged and young people. China&#39;s &quot;Law of the People&#39;s Republic of China on the Protection of Rights and Interests of the Elderly&quot; collectively refers to citizens over 60 years old as the elderly. However, according to the classification of life by the United Nations and World Health Organization in 2020, there are 5 stages. Minors: 0 to 17 years old; young people: 18 to 65 years old; middle-aged people: 66 to 79 years old; elderly: 80 to 99 years old; longevity elderly: over 100 years old. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If according to the new standards of the United Nations, all 18-65 years old are young people, then half of the patients with Alzheimer&#39;s disease in China may be young people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are many factors that contribute to the development of Alzheimer&#39;s disease, but taking one simple preventative approach can reduce the incidence and number of people affected by the disease. Some previous studies have found a link between napping and Alzheimer&#39;s disease. A long-term follow-up survey of the leisure activities and sleep conditions of more than 20,000 elderly people found that those who have the habit of napping have about a 37% lower risk of developing Alzheimer&#39;s disease than those who do not take naps. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, this was only a study of older adults. A recent study on young and middle-aged people found that as long as they have good deep sleep, they can effectively prevent Alzheimer&#39;s disease, especially the younger generation of the disease. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Researchers from the Framingham Heart Institute, the University of Texas and other centers in the United States have just published the results of a study in the Journal of the American Medical Association (&amp;nbsp;JAMA) showing that deep sleep helps To slow down brain aging, every 1% decrease in deep sleep per year is associated with a 27% increase in the risk of dementia, suggesting that maintaining deep sleep time can prevent Alzheimer&#39;s disease. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For this study, researchers used data from the Framingham Heart Study, a long-term, ongoing cardiovascular cohort study of residents of Framingham, Massachusetts. The study began in 1948 with 5,209 adults in Framingham and has continued for more than seventy years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the study, researchers analyzed 346 participants from the Framingham Heart Study cohort who were in their thirties when they originally entered the study (1995-1998). A standard young man. Study participants completed two nocturnal sleep studies measuring polysomnography (PSG) between 1995-1998 and 2001-2003, with an average interval of 5 years between studies. The researchers recorded the participants&#39; Alzheimer&#39;s disease status over the next 17 years and analyzed the relationship between deep sleep and Alzheimer&#39;s disease risk. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Study participants&#39; average percentage of deep sleep at baseline was 18.1%, and participants&#39; deep sleep time decreased between the two nightly sleep studies, suggesting that deep sleep increases with age. reduce. During the 17 years of follow-up, 52 patients with Alzheimer&#39;s disease were diagnosed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After adjusting for other influencing factors, the researchers found that each 1% decrease in deep sleep per year was associated with a 27% increase in the risk of all-cause Alzheimer&#39;s disease and a 32% increase in the risk of Alzheimer&#39;s disease. % related. The study also found that in the presence of a genetic risk for Alzheimer&#39;s disease (APOE4 allele), the decrease in deep sleep accelerates with age, but changes in brain volume do not affect deep sleep time. This means that Alzheimer&#39;s disease can be effectively prevented if people maintain a normal amount of deep sleep. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The reason is that deep sleep is essential for the brain to remove metabolic waste, including the main proteins that accumulate in Alzheimer&#39;s disease, such as amyloid beta (Aβ) and tau protein. At the same time, as we age, there will be less and less deep sleep, which may lead to a continued weakening of lymphoid fluid clearance, increase the risk of Aβ and Tau protein formation, and lead to neurodegenerative diseases or Alzheimer&#39;s disease . At the same time, insufficient deep sleep is also associated with the development of vascular risk factors and may lead to dementia through the accumulation of cerebrovascular disease. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although this study does not reveal the exact cause-and-effect relationship between insufficient deep sleep and Alzheimer&#39;s disease, maintaining deep sleep time is a simple way to prevent Alzheimer&#39;s disease, and it can be done at a young age. You should have and maintain good deep sleep when you are young, because the time of deep sleep is different for different ages. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Deep sleep is also called golden sleep. It is the stage when people sleep the deepest and most soundly. At this time, they cannot hear any noise outside and it is difficult to be awakened by others. During deep sleep, the human body has a powerful body repair function, and the effect of relieving fatigue is also most obvious. For young people aged 20-30, deep sleep accounts for 20%-25% of their sleep time every night, while for elderly people aged 70-80, deep sleep accounts for only 5%-7% of their total sleep time every night. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Deep sleep is related to the duration of sleep, which is another manifestation of quantity and quality. When an average person sleeps less than 6 hours a night, deep sleep will be reduced. Moreover, if you want to have better and more time of deep sleep, you must first fall asleep before 23:00. 23:00 to 3:00 the next morning is the best time to enter deep sleep. Once you miss it, no matter how long you sleep afterwards, you will It&#39;s hard to make up for it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, even a very short nap, 1-3 pm is the optimal rest time, which can enhance the brain&#39;s memory processing ability. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the information age, in order to reduce and prevent the early onset of Alzheimer&#39;s disease, it is best not to stay up late and maintain normal and better deep sleep. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;获取更多RSS：&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 09 Nov 2023 12:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[69个案例，多个政府部门被立案调查背后：反垄断的硬骨头]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260196]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-09 11:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;Starting in March 2022, the State Administration for Market Regulation will launch a nationwide campaign to curb administrative abuses Powers, special actions to eliminate law enforcement that restricts competition.

(Photo provided by People’s Vision)&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On April 7, 2023, the Urban Management Bureau of Dingnan County, Jiangxi Province was placed under investigation for reasons related to the operating rights of shared bicycles. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;At the end of 2022, the Dingnan County Urban Management Bureau will conduct a public bidding for the shared electric bicycle operating rights project in the main urban area of ​​the county. In the end, two companies obtained the operating rights, and the Urban Management Bureau signed contracts with these two companies, limiting a total of 1,500 vehicles to be put into operation for a period of three years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;After investigation by the Jiangxi Provincial Market Supervision and Administration Bureau, it is believed that the Dingnan County Urban Management Bureau limited the number of shared electric vehicles in the main urban area through public bidding without any legal and regulatory basis. Operating enterprises excludes or restricts other business entities with qualified qualifications and service capabilities from entering this market, hindering fair market competition. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Dingnan County Urban Management Bureau was found to have abused administrative power to exclude and restrict competition. This behavior is also called administrative monopoly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Chen Bing, director of the Competition Law Research Center of Nankai University, explained that administrative monopoly is an administrative monopoly that directly or indirectly interferes with market competition to protect or support certain entities by abusing administrative power. specific operators or commodities to maximize the interests of themselves or others. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;2023 is the 15th anniversary of the implementation of the Anti-Monopoly Law. The &quot;Regulations on Preventing the Abuse of Administrative Power to Eliminate or Restrict Competition&quot; have also been revised. Starting from April 15, 2023 Effective from today. Since March 2022, the State Administration for Market Regulation has launched a nationwide special campaign to stop the abuse of administrative power and exclude and restrict competition from law enforcement. From June 2022 to January 2023, a total of 5 batches and 63 administrative monopoly cases were announced. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In 2023, the State Administration for Market Regulation will launch a special anti-monopoly law enforcement action in the field of people&#39;s livelihood. The two batches of typical cases currently announced include 6 administrative monopoly cases. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In September 2023, the behavior of the Dingnan County Urban Management Bureau was reported as a typical case of anti-administrative monopoly. At present, the Dingnan County Urban Management Bureau has made rectifications, canceled the contract, and issued an announcement to fully open the shared electric vehicle market in the main urban area of ​​the county. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;With &quot;good intentions&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;October 2023 On the 18th, relevant staff from the Dingnan County Urban Management Bureau told Southern Weekend reporters that they had canceled the bidding. The Harbin Urban Management Bureau, which was put under investigation for the same reason, stated that the shared bicycle bidding business has been handed over to the Municipal Transportation Management Bureau. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Southern Weekend reporters found that in 69 cases, a total of 69 administrative agencies were punished. Generally speaking, the cases involved are mainly concentrated in the fields of people&#39;s livelihood such as urban management, medical care, education, and construction. Chen Bing explained that industry supervision in these fields has obvious characteristics, and administrative agencies can directly allocate resources during the management process. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Judging from the typical cases published, the motivations of the units involved are different, and some administrative monopoly behaviors even occur out of &quot;good intentions.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In March 2022, the Housing and Urban-Rural Development Bureau of Xiangshan County, Ningbo City issued a recommended list of housing safety appraisal institutions, requiring those who carry out housing safety appraisal business in Xiangshan County to obtain the municipal certification After filing the certificate with the Housing and Urban-Rural Development Bureau, you should register with the County Housing and Urban-Rural Development Bureau. In October 2022, the Zhejiang Provincial Market Supervision Bureau determined that this behavior constituted the abuse of administrative power to exclude and restrict competition. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;A staff member of the Xiangshan County Housing and Urban-Rural Development Bureau told Southern Weekend reporters that their original intention was to facilitate the masses, “They always ask questions like this when they come to do business. ——We don’t know which housing safety agencies to look for for appraisal, so we put the list of nearly 20 registered agencies on the official account of the County Housing and Urban-Rural Development Bureau.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The above-mentioned staff emphasized that house safety appraisal is a bottom-line issue. They need to comprehensively analyze the qualifications, capabilities, and creditworthiness of all appraisal agencies before making it public. Therefore, they A directory of housing safety appraisal agencies registered in Ningbo City will be formed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;After the investigation, the Xiangshan County Housing and Urban-Rural Development Bureau has withdrawn the recommended list. However, this staff member believes that if there are only one or two houses, it may be a monopoly. However, their recommended list includes more than a dozen housing safety appraisal agencies from Ningbo and Hangzhou, and &quot;there is none in Xiangshan.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In fact, some administrative agencies are not aware that the documents issued constitute an administrative monopoly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In August 2017, the Finance Bureau of Pingluo County, Ningxia designated an insurance company as the underwriting unit for traffic accident insurance for various administrative institutions in the county. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The person in charge of the relevant departments of the Pingluo County Finance Bureau said that because the document was released for so long, the drafter of the document and the person responsible for its preparation and issuance are no longer in the bureau. They had not noticed this document before. It was not until March 2023, when the Market Supervision Bureau came to investigate, that they found the document and invalidated the relevant provisions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;When it comes to the implementation of the document, the person in charge said that it also depends on the budget of each unit. Some units are implementing it, while others have not. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Sun Jin, director of the Competition Law and Policy Research Center of Wuhan University, believes that administrative agencies lack the concept of fair competition in the policy formulation process and often only think about bidding and investment. Introducing investment to stimulate the economy while ignoring the need to maintain the bottom line of fair competition in the market can easily lead to the emergence of administrative monopolies. &lt;strong>; &amp; nbsp; &amp; nbsp; &amp; nbsp; &amp; nbsp; &amp; nbsp; &amp; nbsp; &amp; nbsp; &amp; nbsp; &amp; nbsp; &amp; nbsp; &amp; nbsp; &amp; nbsp; sp; &amp; nbsp; &amp; nbsp; &amp; nbsp; &amp; nbsp; &amp; nbsp; &amp; nbsp; &amp; nbsp; &amp; nbsp ;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Antitrust and Anti-Corruption&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; >;Among the reported administrative monopoly cases, the common handling methods are to abrogate the execution of the original documents, terminate the bidding work or cancel the contract, and submit a rectification report. There are also cases where the market supervision and administration administration issues administrative proposals to the local people&#39;s government, and a few supervisors Personnel and those directly responsible were punished, often involving corruption such as power-for-money transactions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In April 2021, the Chenzhou City Education Bureau of Hunan Province identified 4 school uniform production and supply manufacturers through bidding, and divided the urban area into 4 areas, limiting each area. Regional schools can only purchase uniforms from designated manufacturers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;When investigating in August 2021, the Hunan Provincial Market Supervision Bureau believed that the above behavior deprived the school and the parent committee of the right to make independent choices. As a result, the bidding process was terminated in September 2021. (The special action in 2022 announced 5 batches of 63 typical cases, 23 of which were filed for investigation in 2021.)&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;October 18, 2023, A staff member of the Chenzhou City Education Bureau office said that the technical equipment department, a secondary organization under the Education Bureau, is responsible for the primary and secondary school uniform business. Due to disciplinary violations in the public bidding process for the qualification of primary and secondary school uniform manufacturers, this organization was suspended midway. The Administration for Market Regulation called a halt, and the Commission for Discipline Inspection subsequently intervened in the investigation, and the person in charge of the agency was also punished. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The Chenzhou Municipal Commission for Discipline Inspection pointed out that from 2013 to 2022, Li Junhong took advantage of his position as deputy director and director of the Technical Equipment Department of the Chenzhou Municipal Education Bureau to facilitate others. Undertaken primary and secondary schools uniform business, school laboratories, facilities and equipment and installation service procurement and other projects to provide assistance, illegally receiving other people&#39;s property totaling 2.448 million yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In June 2022, Li Junhong was expelled from the party and dismissed from public office. Suspected criminal issues were transferred to the procuratorate for review and prosecution in accordance with the law. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;After being punished, the Chenzhou Municipal Education Bureau took rectification measures. The above-mentioned staff stated that the Education Bureau, together with the Municipal Development and Reform Commission and the Municipal Supervision Bureau, issued a notice on further standardizing the management of primary and secondary school uniforms on September 15, 2021, emphasizing that all documents and materials for the selection and purchase of school uniforms should be archived by the school. School uniforms Procurement contracts must be filed with the competent education department, and transactions shall not be interfered with by violating market principles or by fixing trademarks or other methods. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In addition, a monopoly case involving the Health Bureau of Shuangfeng County, Hunan Province is also worthy of attention. At the end of October 2021, relevant companies in the county jointly reported that the Shuangfeng County Health Bureau signed an agreement with a company to issue mandatory target tasks for drug procurement by county-affiliated public medical institutions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;An investigation by the Hunan Market Supervision Bureau found that Shuangfeng County Health Bureau signed a cooperation agreement with Sinopharm Holding Changsha Co., Ltd., requiring all public medical institutions in Shuangfeng County to A certain proportion of the purchase volume of medicines, consumables, equipment, etc. is provided to Sinopharm Holding Changsha Co., Ltd., and the Shuangfeng County Health Bureau also issues quotas in the form of documents to public medical institutions in the county. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The agreement also stipulates that from July 2021 to the end of 2022, the total purchase quota from public medical institutions in Shuangfeng County to Sinopharm Holding Changsha Co., Ltd. is 1.2 billion. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On October 19, 2023, a reporter from Southern Weekend contacted the person in charge of the Essential Drugs Unit of Shuangfeng County Health Bureau who is responsible for drug procurement and asked about the whole story. The other party said, &quot;I don&#39;t know and I don&#39;t want to talk about it.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In Sun Jin’s view, antitrust is often closely related to anti-corruption. Some companies rack their brains to maintain relationships with officials with decision-making power, waiting for the time to mature. , they will require the other party to formulate rules to protect their interests, such as granting exclusive business rights, or giving opportunities in policy preferences, incentives and subsidies, and bidding. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;This also means that some market entities will also push administrative agencies to abuse administrative power.&quot; Sun Jin added. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;The harm of administrative monopoly&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Compared to the economy Sexual monopoly and administrative monopoly rarely come into public view. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Chen Bing believes that on the one hand, there are indeed fewer cases of administrative monopoly than economic monopoly cases; on the other hand, administrative monopoly is mainly ordered to correct and punished by superior authorities. The focus is on punishing supervisors or other responsible personnel in accordance with the law, and the punishment information does not belong to the content that must be disclosed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;But administrative monopoly is more harmful than economic monopoly.&quot; Chen Bing explained that administrative monopoly sets unreasonable entry barriers, causing market Fragmentation and misallocation of resources prevent other operators from making full use of their own advantages to participate in competition. In the long run, this will reduce the competitiveness and innovation capabilities of all enterprises in the market, and at the same time reduce the total social welfare. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Sun Jin believes that for anti-monopoly law enforcement agencies, anti-economic monopoly is mainly a technical issue, and it is not difficult to judge whether it has substantially hindered fair market competition. Not big. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;He emphasized that the hard nut of anti-monopoly is actually administrative monopoly. At present, abuse of power still occurs from time to time, and it is still very serious in some areas. In addition, in administrative monopolies, there is a large amount of interest transfer, and some companies gain unfair competitive advantages, suppress small and medium-sized enterprises, and compete for their profit opportunities. This is contrary to common prosperity, high-quality development, and the construction of a unified national market. Anti-administrative monopoly has always been the top priority of anti-monopoly work. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;It is worth noting that on August 1, 2022, the first day the new Anti-Monopoly Law came into effect, Gan Lin, Director of the State Anti-Monopoly Bureau, published an article in the &quot;People&#39;s Daily&quot; The signed article mentioned that &quot;we must insist on equal emphasis on preventing market monopoly and breaking administrative monopoly.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;At the 2023 National Market Supervision System Anti-Monopoly Work Conference, anti-administrative monopoly is also the focus of the 2023 work goals, including strengthening the supply of fair competition review systems , studying and drafting the &quot;Fair Competition Review Regulations (Draft)&quot;, etc. At present, the &quot;Fair Competition Review Regulations&quot; have been publicly solicited for opinions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In the 15 years since the Anti-Monopoly Law was implemented, the fair competition review mechanism has been an important part of the anti-administrative monopoly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In 2016, the State Council issued the &quot;Opinions on Establishing a Fair Competition Review System in the Construction of the Market System&quot;, emphasizing standardizing government behavior and establishing a fair competition review system. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;A landmark node is that the State Administration for Market Regulation was officially listed in April 2018 and began to assume unified anti-monopoly law enforcement responsibilities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In June 2022, the Anti-Monopoly Law was revised for the first time after its promulgation. The chapter involving anti-administrative monopoly added a fair competition review system. &quot;This is equivalent to controlling the situation from the source and reducing the impact of policies formulated by administrative agencies on market competition,&quot; Chen Bing analyzed. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Breaking down regional barriers&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Relevant regulations and policies are constantly evolving While improving, anti-administrative monopoly law enforcement has also been continuously strengthened. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The special anti-administrative monopoly action in 2022 is not the first time. From September 2019 to January 2020, the State Administration for Market Regulation carried out special actions nationwide to stop the abuse of administrative power and exclude and restrict competition from law enforcement, focusing on transportation, construction, medicine, official seal engraving, bidding and government procurement5 an area where there are many illegal activities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;During the special operation, the market supervision department investigated more than 50 cases in the above five fields and verified more than 80 case clues. However, no typical cases were announced to the public at that time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In addition, the State Administration for Market Regulation has published an annual report on antitrust enforcement every year since its establishment. The report shows that from 2019 to 2022, law enforcement agencies investigated a total of 354 cases of abuse of administrative power to eliminate or restrict competition, and concluded 198 cases. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Among them, the numbers of such cases investigated from 2019 to 2021 were 84, 98, and 80 respectively, and the numbers settled were 12, 67, and 46 respectively. The State Administration for Market Regulation launched a special law enforcement action on the abuse of administrative power to exclude and restrict competition in 2022, investigating a total of 92 cases and settling 73 cases. The number of settlements increased by 59% compared with 2021. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In contrast, in the eleven years from 2008 to 2018, antitrust law enforcement agencies investigated and dealt with a total of 223 such cases, with an average of approximately 20 cases; and in the four years from 2019 to 2022, the average was 88 cases per year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The fair competition review system is also constantly being implemented and promoted. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In 2019, the fair competition review system achieved full coverage of the national, provincial, municipal, and county governments. As of the end of 2020, a total of 857,000 newly issued policies had been reviewed across the country, and more than 4,100 policy measures that violated review standards were discovered and corrected. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In 2022 alone, various regions and departments will review 163,700 newly issued policies and measures, clean up 452,000 existing policies and measures of various types, and abolish, revise, and correct There are more than 20,000 policies and measures to eliminate or restrict competition. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In other words, these policy documents that may affect fair competition in the market have not been issued because they have not passed the fair competition review, or previously issued documents have been abolished because they have not passed the review. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Overall, the anti-administrative monopoly work has a long way to go, and there are still some problems that need to be solved urgently. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Chen Bing pointed out that on the one hand, it is necessary to break down local protection and regional barriers, thoroughly clean up policies and practices that hinder market access and the free circulation of commodity factors, and reduce institutional Transaction costs are the key to breaking down barriers that restrict economic circulation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On the other hand, it is necessary to continuously regulate the interference of administrative power in market competition, &quot;especially in the fields of bidding, government procurement, public utilities and other fields, to prevent designated transactions , discriminatory conditions and other unfair behaviors, allowing local governments to effectively form an integrated competition protection mechanism of &#39;pre-examination + in-process and post-event supervision&#39;.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In Sun Jin’s view, consciousness and concepts are the core issues. He believes that antitrust laws need to be popularized among government officials so that they can make scientific, reasonable and legal decisions based on the provisions of antitrust laws and fair competition review systems. “Consumers and small and medium-sized enterprises also need to be mobilized to supervise the government, and all parties can work together to promote An ecology of fair competition.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 09 Nov 2023 11:25:03 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[跨国药企扎堆进博会，多款创新药首秀]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260172]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-09 10:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 09 Nov 2023 10:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[被传收购碧桂园？中国平安回应]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260182]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-09 09:30:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;On November 8, foreign media reported the news of Ping An’s acquisition of Country Garden. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/4b28e3afa0ab6ee807d2c994e8a6fd08.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;427&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/4b28e3afa0ab6ee807d2c994e8a6fd08.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;257517&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;In this regard, Ping An issued a statement saying that the company has noticed a news report published by Reuters about the company being required by relevant government departments/institutions to acquire Country Garden Holdings Co., Ltd. and inherit its debts.

On the morning of October 21, 2023, local time in Bolivia, the Shaolin cultural delegation watched the Shaolin Kungfu report performance of Bolivian Shaolin disciples and interacted on the spot. While in Bolivia, the Shaolin cultural delegation also visited the South American Shaolin Cultural Center, Bolivia Baoen Temple and other places. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Prior to this, a video on Weibo of a young black monk practicing Shaolin Kung Fu also sparked heated discussions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Not only is the young monk boxing in the video black, but the master is also black. This is a branch of the Shaolin Temple in Africa. Some people say that this is the flowering of Chinese culture within the wall and the loss of culture; the Shaolin Temple is becoming more and more international, making people feel that it has lost its original flavor. This view is of course wrong, and someone has refuted it very well: once it is exported, it will be lost, and if it is not exported, it will be criticized as cultural weakness. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Shaolin Temple has been engaged in systematic cultural dissemination, forming many practice platforms that influence and disseminate Shaolin Kungfu and its culture, and building a global dissemination mechanism centered on Shaolin culture at home and abroad. It has had a huge social impact. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In July 2001, Shaolin layman &quot;foreign disciple&quot; Deller opened the Shaolin Cultural Center in Berlin, Germany. This was the first overseas branch directly authorized to cooperate with the Shaolin Temple. Currently, there are nearly 200 overseas Shaolin cultural centers distributed around the world. According to data from relevant institutions, there are no less than 60 million people practicing Shaolin Kung Fu around the world; there are hundreds of Shaolin cultural institutions in more than 100 countries and regions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2010, the &quot;Shaolin European Federation&quot; was established in Vienna; in 2004, the California House of Representatives unanimously passed a resolution and established in law March 21 of each year as &quot;Songshan Shaolin Temple Day&quot;. In 2010, the &quot;Shaolin European Federation&quot; was announced in Vienna, Austria; in 2011, the &quot;Shaolin North American Federation&quot; was established in Los Angeles, the United States. In 2014, the 10th anniversary of the establishment of &quot;Songshan Shaolin Temple Day&quot; in California, the then US President Obama said in his congratulatory message: &quot;Shaolin culture can provide us with spiritual space and help us cultivate a strong sense of social responsibility.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Shaolin Temple recruits foreign disciples and even goes out to build temples and Kung Fu training classes, which can not only promote Buddhism, but also Shaolin Kung Fu and spread Chinese culture. Shaolin Temple is the place where Patriarch Bodhidharma stayed the longest after he came to China. It is known as the ancestral palace of Zen Buddhism. Zen Buddhism absorbs a large amount of ideological content from Confucianism and Taoism, turning foreign Buddhism into a Chinese Buddhism that corresponds to China&#39;s specific social and historical conditions and ideological and cultural background. Therefore, Zen Buddhism has realized the transformation from the Sinicization of Buddhism to Sinicized Buddhism and is rich in profound Chinese cultural elements. Shaolin Kung Fu and Shaolin Temple have gone global, and Chinese culture has also expanded its influence. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although black young monks and black abbots seem to be inconsistent, it is just because they are not used to it. It should be pointed out that the process of cultural export, success and acceptance cannot remain unchanged. It will also change and alienate according to local social, cultural, technological, economic, moral, conceptual and other factors, forming new ones to some extent. culture. We must maintain a tolerant attitude toward such changes and mutations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Nowadays, the influence of the Chinese New Year (Spring Festival) is growing, and many countries and regions have designated the Chinese New Year as a legal holiday. There will be a holiday on this day, and national and regional leaders will extend holiday greetings to those celebrating the Spring Festival. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the international context, the Chinese New Year is often written as: Chinese new year. &quot;Happy Chinese New Year&quot; is translated as &quot;Happy Chinese New Year&quot;, indicating that this New Year comes from the Chinese calendar. However, with the growing influence of the Spring Festival, there is now a trend to translate the Spring Festival into &quot;Lunar New Year&quot;. Lunar means &quot;moon&quot; and can be understood as &quot;lunar calendar&quot;. Nowadays, many people use it this way. US officials use &quot;Lunar New Year&quot; when issuing New Year greetings. United Nations Secretary-General Guterres also used &quot;Lunar New Year&quot; in his New Year greeting video. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some people say that this is an attempt to de-Sinicize the Spring Festival and steal a Chinese festival. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;You don’t have to look at it this way. This is the normal state of cultural export. The Romans originally used the Egyptian lunar calendar. In 46 BC, Roman commander Julius Caesar decided to recompile the Julian Calendar based on the Egyptian solar calendar. In 325 AD, the Roman Emperor Constantine established the Julian calendar as the Christian calendar. By the 6th century AD, Christians regarded the day when Jesus, the founder of Christian legends, was born more than 500 years ago as the first year of AD. Before the 16th century, most Western countries adopted the Julian calendar. In 1582, Pope Gregory XIII, with the assistance of the Neapolitan astronomer and physicist Giraldi and the German mathematician and Jesuit Clavius, corrected the Julian calendar promulgated in 46 BC. Errors formed the Gregorian calendar commonly used in our modern society. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the Revolution of 1911, the Provisional Government of the Republic of China legislated to use the Gregorian calendar from January 1, 1912, and designated January 1 of the Gregorian calendar as the &quot;New Year&quot;. This is now recognized around the world as the starting point of the new year. However, now everyone in the world can only say &quot;Happy New Year&quot; but not &quot;Happy Roman New Year&quot;. This is not stealing a holiday from the Romans or Christians, but a normal process of cultural export. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many countries in Asia also celebrate the Lunar New Year, such as South Korea, Vietnam, Singapore, Malaysia, etc.如果站在他们的角度，也许不愿带上有“中国的”这种明显地域化的名称，所以他们就会用“Happy Lunar New Year”来表达“春节快乐”，这就如同中国人不会说“罗马新年快乐”一样，但又有什么关系呢？这一历法就是从中国传出去的。传统时代朝贡体系之下，中国的皇朝会颁历法，让周边属国“奉正朔”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;所以，不管是非洲黑人少林寺弟子，还是被称为“农历新年”，都是真真切切的文化输出。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（本文仅为作者个人观点，不代表本报立场）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;这又是一起“开门杀”案件。南方周末记者搜索相关裁判文书网发现，近年来，“开门杀”事故高频出现。中国交通运输协会法律工作委员会秘书长代现峰认为，随着私家车和非机动车辆的大幅度增长，大众普遍缺乏对“开门杀”危害的认知，导致这类事故频发。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;代现峰告诉南方周末记者，开门杀主要分为两种类型：一种是司机本人开车门，与非机动车辆相撞，此时司机负全责；另一种是乘客开车门，与非机动车辆相撞，一般乘客会与司机构成共同侵权。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;后一种情况又可细分出不同的事故类型，最终赔偿责任也会不同。常见的两种情形是：司机与乘客存在运营关系，例如出租车、网约车等载客行为；司机与乘客系朋友或亲戚关系，不存在运营关系。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“&#39;开门杀&#39;是交通事故中的一个热点话题，杀伤力很强，其责任认定也一直都有争议。”常年代理交通事故案件的资深律师周波补充，目前中国各地的交管部门在认定“开门杀”事故责任时，尚缺乏统一的认定标准。&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;网约车平台承担什么责任&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;2020年11月3日18点，正值下班时间，39岁的张赫在非机动车道骑电动车回家路上，与一辆刚刚推开车门的网约车相撞，导致张赫重伤，昏迷不醒。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;事发上海市松江区中山二路。相关判决书显示，网约车司机夏某林完成一单出行任务后，临时停车未将车辆紧靠道路右侧，且未提醒乘客方某昕观察后方道路来车情况，方某昕打开右侧车门，导致了张赫受伤的结果。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“我老公现在连老爸、老妈和儿子的名字都不记得，他自己的名字也不记得了。”张赫妻子告诉南方周末记者，张赫原本是家里的顶梁柱，因为这场车祸导致颅脑损伤构成十级残疾，治疗至今未愈。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;经上海市公安局松江分局交通警察支队认定，司机夏某林承担事故主要责任，乘客方某昕承担次要责任，张赫无责。后法院判决，司机、乘客二人构成共同侵权。其中，司机的赔偿比例为70%，赔偿82万元；乘客的赔偿比例为30%，35万元。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“交通部门会先出一份事故责任认定书，认定司机与乘客的主次责任。之后法庭在审判时会根据该责任认定书判决。”代现峰告诉南方周末记者，交通部门出具的责任认定书，不会将司机与乘客的责任明确到具体的比例划分，至于最终法庭如何划分主次要责任比例，属于人民法院行使裁量权的范围。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;值得注意的是，上述案件的判决书显示，夏某林使用私家车实际并不具备营运车辆相关保险，其网约车平台滴滴出行公司未尽到应有的审核职责；且滴滴作为平台和夏某林共同分享收益，承担风险，保障运营安全，都算是乘客的承运人。所以滴滴依法应对伤者遭受的损失与司机夏某林承担连带责任，共同赔偿82万元。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“不论这辆网约车有没有营运车辆相关资质，司机接单都算是执行职务行为。可能司机并不是滴滴的员工，但在法律上只要有执行工作任务的行为，平台就有责任。”代现峰说。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;《网络预约出租汽车经营服务管理暂行办法》第十六条规定：“网约车平台公司承担承运人责任，应当保证运营安全，保障乘客合法权益。”中国民法典也有相关规定，要求网约车平台承担司机与乘客之间运输合同项下承运人的责任。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这就意味着，在面向广大消费者时，运输合同项下，原属司机的承运人职责及赔偿义务，很大程度上可能由网约车平台承担。同理，出租车司机与出租车公司也是如此。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;如果乘客推开车门导致“车门杀”，但司机已经尽到提醒义务，还需要承担责任吗？代现峰告诉南方周末记者：“除非乘客故意，否则司机依然需要承担一定的事故责任，司机背后有平台或保险公司，其赔偿能力更强，让受害人依法拿到赔偿才是法律的实质公平。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但并非所有情形都要机动车车主担责。周波向南方周末记者补充，如果车辆合规停靠在路边打开车门，因非机动车辆逆行或其它自身原因导致“开门杀”伤亡事故，交管部门也可能会认定非机动车承担主要甚至全部责任。&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;保险应认车，还是认人&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;周波告诉南方周末记者，在乘客导致的“开门杀”案件中，备受争议的环节主要有两个：一个是前端的交管部门如何认定司机与乘客的主次责任；另一个是车辆投保的保险公司，是否应该代乘客赔偿？&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“最关键的环节是前端责任认定，什么情况下乘客应该承担责任，怎么划分主次责任，以及什么情况下不需要乘客承担责任。”周波告诉南方周末记者，交管部门责任认定的方式和标准目前尚不统一。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;近几年，在周波代理的“开门杀”案件中，各地交警认定标准不一，这也直接影响了最终庭审判决。例如，同为乘客开门，有的交警认为乘客和司机是一体的，同为侵权人；也有交警认定司机应负全责。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;例如，一份2020年公开的判决书显示，广西罗城县发生一起“开门杀”事故后，当地交警部门就案涉事故出具的《道路交通事故认定书》认定，乘客在开关车门时妨碍其他车辆通行，承担本次交通事故的全部责任，司机无责。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;代现峰介绍，一般情况下，法庭的判决结果会与交通部门出具的事故责任认定书相符，除非有其它相反的直接证据足以推翻责任认定书。“一方面，从专业角度讲，法官不比交警更擅长处理交通事故；另一方面，国家机关出具的证据证明力比其它一般证据证明力要高。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“如果司机负全责，反而不会有太大争议，因为最后由保险公司赔钱。但如果定了乘客承担责任，就存在争议了。”周波介绍，当乘客被认定担责时，主要争议点就会变成：车辆投保的保险公司该不该承担乘客的责任？&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;南方周末记者查询多份裁判文书发现，当司机与主动开门的乘客不存在营运关系，而是亲戚或朋友时，多位司机会主张自己负全责。其原因在于，司机作为车主，均有购买交强险或商业三者险，保险公司可以代其赔偿。也正因如此，在该类“开门杀”案件中，保险公司与案件侵权人之间的官司层出不穷。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2019年12月，北京市丰台区发生一起“开门杀”事故，车主张某艳与推开车门的乘客马某双系朋友关系。经丰台交通支队丰北大队处理认定，该案中车主和乘客负事故同等责任。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在法庭上，车主张某艳辩称自己未尽提醒义务，应负全责。乘客马某双亦提出，没有车辆就没有自己下车的行为，保险公司应认准投保的车辆，而非细究导致车辆发生事故的人。保险公司则辩称，公司只承担投保车主张某艳的应赔金额，即按50%的比例赔偿，且不认可张某艳承担全责。其称：“根据保险法，张某艳违反诚信原则，主动加重自己的责任，导致我司可能发生过多的赔偿，我司保留追究其二人保险诈骗的权利。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;最终法院判决，保险公司应当基于车主与乘客的连带赔偿责任，对伤者的各项损失在保险责任范围内承担赔偿责任。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;南方周末记者发现，此类“开门杀”案件中，最终由保险公司代乘客赔偿的判决诸多。在前述罗城县的“开门杀”案件中，虽然法院判决乘客负全责，但最终对伤者的赔偿由涉案车辆投保的保险公司代赔。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“保险公司一般都会抗辩。他们认为保险赔偿是针对投保的车主，一旦开车的人不是车主，都不应该赔偿。但这个答辩意见只能说有一定道理，法院常常不采纳。”周波称，目前，保险合同本身关于这方面的免责条款本不明确，不同的人会有不同理解。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;目前，已有部分网约车平台和出租车公司要求乘客开右边车门上下车，作为预防“开门杀”的一种措施。代现峰认为，有必要针对学员加强“开门杀”的相关教育宣传：“我认为在考驾照时，&#39;开门杀&#39;也应当作为重点内容培训。我们汽车起步前和停车后都会要求看反光镜，但没有直接针对&#39;开门杀&#39;进行培训。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;• &lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;
