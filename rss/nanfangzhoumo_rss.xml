(Picture/Southern Weekend reporter Lu Huiqian)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;China and India are rising at the same time. How to handle Sino-Indian relations is not only related to the interests of the two countries, but also crucial to the entire world.&quot; December 3, 2023 On Japan, Ashok K. Kantha, former Indian Ambassador to China, said in an exclusive interview with a reporter from Southern Weekend on the sidelines of the 2023 &quot;Understanding China&quot; international conference. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Kant is a senior Indian diplomat and China expert. He served as the Consul General of India in Hong Kong, China, and as the Ambassador of India to China from 2014 to 2016. Currently, Conte works at the China Institute, an authoritative academic institution, which is located in New Delhi, the capital of India. It is the oldest institution on China issues in India. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I have worked in China and been engaged in China research for 15 years. I can only say that I have a certain understanding of China. China is very big and complex. No one dares to say that they fully understand China.&quot; Conte said with a smile. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As the Indian ambassador to China, Kant has witnessed the good development of Sino-Indian relations. During his tenure, the heads of state of China and India visited each other&#39;s hometowns. But he admitted frankly that &quot;the current Sino-Indian relations need to resolve some outstanding issues and pass them smoothly.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;There are many similarities between China and India.&quot; Conte said that historically, the two countries used to be the world&#39;s largest economies, but subsequently lagged behind world development. Now China and India are re-emerging. , &quot;Both sides should support each other.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Seeing China from Two Perspectives&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong style=&quot;color: #9a0000;&quot;>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;First time participating in &quot;Understanding China&quot; How do you feel about international conferences? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Conte: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;For me, this is a good opportunity to try to understand China’s views on various issues. Especially how China tells its story to the outside world. This morning, I attended a closed-door seminar on Sino-US relations. Participants from China, the United States, South Korea and India had a long discussion, and I was also one of the speakers. This discussion was very fruitful and can help us understand a very critical issue - how the future development trajectory of Sino-US relations will affect the entire world. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong style=&quot;color: #9a0000;&quot;>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;What suggestions do you have for promoting mutual understanding between China and India? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Conte:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;China has a long civilization and is also the world&#39;s second largest economy and the most important trading partner of nearly 40 countries around the world. There is no doubt that issues involving China will arouse the attention of other countries, including India, and some of China&#39;s measures will also cause concerns in other countries, so it is very important to understand China&#39;s ambitions and how China develops. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, China is India&#39;s largest neighbor, and India also hopes to maintain friendly relations with China. However, currently, relations between the two countries are in a difficult period due to border issues. If the boundary issue cannot be normalized, it will be difficult for the overall relations between China and India to return to normal. Against this backdrop, we hope to be able to communicate our concerns and expectations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong style=&quot;color: #9a0000;&quot;>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;You have served as India’s ambassador to China before. What new feelings do you have when you return to China this time? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Conte: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I have worked in China for a long time. The first time I came to China was in 1981, when I was a young diplomat. Later, I served as the Consul General of India in Hong Kong, China and the Ambassador of India to China. But at that time, I was working in China as a diplomat. Today, as an ordinary Indian citizen studying China issues, I went to China to participate in a conference and tried to understand China. These are two different perspectives. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;China-India relations are very important. It is a complex relationship with challenges, but we hope to have constructive engagement with China. In the early years, I was working in China on behalf of India. My perspective on the problem and my specific working methods were all different. As an ordinary citizen, I can promote mutual understanding between China and India in my own way. In particular, I have many old friends in China. We can talk openly and honestly. I will tell them what concerns India has and what changes it expects China to make. The dialogue between us is very friendly and candid. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;The most populous&quot; has mixed blessings&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong style=&quot;color: #9a0000;&quot;>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;In 2023, India will surpass China and become the The most populous country in the world, what does this mean for India? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Conte: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I don’t think it made a big difference. India and China are the two most populous countries in the world, with about 1.4 billion people each. For India, we need to take greater responsibility to look after such a huge population to ensure that the country continues to develop. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Historically, India and China were once the largest economies in the world. Research by Angus Maddison, a well-known British economist, pointed out that in the 17th and 18th centuries, the economies of China and India were leading the world, but later India encountered colonial rule and lost development opportunities, and its economic growth continued to slow down. Slowly, GDP dropped from about 25% of the world at that time to 4% in 1950. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Now, we are working hard to rebuild our country and our economy. India has been doing very well over the past three decades, with economic growth rate second only to China. But we also face huge challenges in many areas, especially in providing a better life for our people and in technological development and transformation. China and India are very similar and we can learn from each other&#39;s experiences. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong style=&quot;color: #9a0000;&quot;>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;What opportunities and challenges will becoming the world&#39;s most populous country bring to India? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Conte:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;One of India’s great advantages is that it has a very young population. The median age of the population in India is about 28 years old, and that&#39;s the demographic dividend we have. A larger youth population means more people to serve in the Indian economy. We must make full use of this dividend and think about how to enable this young working population to contribute to India&#39;s achievement of becoming a developed economy. India&#39;s goal is to become a developed country by 2047, the 100th anniversary of India&#39;s independence. Although this task is difficult, India is working towards this goal. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, India provides jobs for nearly 12 million new workers every year, which is a huge number. Similar to China, India is also facing the problem of youth unemployment or underemployment, so we must create new job opportunities on a large scale. But this goal can only be achieved by ensuring that the economy continues to grow at a rate of 7% or 8%. It&#39;s a big challenge, but one we can meet. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;Without the participation of China and India, it is difficult to solve major global issues&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong style=&quot;color: #9a0000;&quot;>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;As China&#39;s largest neighbor and a member of the BRICS, how does India view its relationship with China? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Conte:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;India and China have a complex relationship with many unresolved issues, including border disputes. Both China and India are trying to establish a constructive and friendly partnership. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Now, the situation on the Sino-Indian border is not stable. If the border issue is not resolved, it will be difficult for the overall relations between the two countries to return to normal. Therefore, the direct challenge we face is how to restore peace and tranquility on the border. Now, China and India have made some progress, but there is still a lot of work to be done. We need to have closer and more strategic dialogue so that bilateral issues can be effectively resolved, so as to contribute to the two countries&#39; efforts in regional and global issues. to create conditions for joint cooperation. China and India are the two most populous countries in the world and rank among the world&#39;s five largest economies. Without the participation of China and India, major global issues such as climate change, terrorism and artificial intelligence will be difficult to fully resolve. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong style=&quot;color: #9a0000;&quot;>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;As the two largest developing countries in the world, how can the two sides enhance mutual trust and cooperation? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Conte:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;China and India have maintained good cooperation in many fields in the past, and China is India&#39;s second largest trading partner. In 2022, bilateral trade between China and India will be close to US$135 billion. But India is also worried. India&#39;s trade deficit with China exceeds 100 billion US dollars. India looks forward to pursuing a more balanced economic engagement with China, but we also need to respect each other&#39;s concerns, interests and ambitions. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Now China and India are rising at the same time and becoming two major countries in the world. In this process, how to handle Sino-Indian relations is not only related to the interests of the two countries, but also to the entire world. Crucial. China and India can rise at the same time, and both sides should support each other. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;India will not join any military alliance&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong style=&quot;color: #9a0000;&quot;>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;For a long time, India has Diplomatically, India pursues a policy of non-alignment, but in recent years, India seems to be turning to the United States and strengthening military cooperation with Japan. What do you think of this trend? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Conte:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;India seeks to have good relations with all major countries in the world, whether it is the United States, China, Russia, Japan and European countries. However, we will maintain an independent foreign policy and make decisions based on specific issues without joining any military alliance. This basic national policy has not changed. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is no doubt that the relationship between India and the United States has changed, especially in the past 20 years. The United States has become India&#39;s largest trading partner. We cooperate with the United States, Western countries and Japan because we believe this is very important for India&#39;s economic and technological transformation. In fact, China is also working closely with these countries. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;India seeks to establish closer ties with the United States and is also strengthening security cooperation under the &quot;Quadrilateral Mechanism&quot;. But what needs to be made clear is that the &quot;Quadrilateral Security Dialogue&quot; between the United States, Japan, India, and Australia is not a military mechanism, and India is not willing to join any alliance. We just want to maintain our strategic independence. India&#39;s stance on the Russia-Ukraine conflict illustrates all this. We have adopted a stance that is completely different from that of the United States and Western countries. India will maintain an independent foreign policy on all issues. On some issues, we will cooperate with the United States and Japan, but on some issues, we may also have differences with them. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong style=&quot;color: #9a0000;&quot;>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;What factors will India pay attention to? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Conte:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;India does not want to see any confrontation and armed conflict between China and the United States, because this will have a negative impact on global development . &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In November 2023, the heads of state of China and the United States will meet in San Francisco, which will help restore Sino-US relations to a certain extent. India welcomes such changes and looks forward to seeing the world’s most Two powerful countries re-establish a more stable relationship. However, the strategic competition between China and the United States still faces potential structural challenges, and it is still unclear how the relationship between the two parties will evolve. We hope that China and the United States will avoid conflict, because this is not in the interest of both parties, nor is it in the interest of other countries, including India. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 06 Dec 2023 13:25:05 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[面对民主制度的退潮，查尔斯·泰勒开出了这样的药方]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261938]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-12-06 12:02:30&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 12/05/ibDnm46IXLOJQYg6c9u3Z3FsQhTaeL8ipzgyGOqz.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;726&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/05/ibDnm46IXLOJQYg6c9u3Z3FsQhTaeL8 ipzgyGOqz. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;260822&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Canadian philosopher Charles Taylor and his new book &quot;The Decline of Democracy&quot; (with Craig Calhoun, Dilip Parameshwar Gaonkar). &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(data map/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since the end of the last century, the trends of neoliberalism, globalization and democratization have swept the world, as if the entire There is only one way, one path in the world. But twenty or thirty years later, since Brexit, Trump’s rise to power, and right-wing parties winning elections around the world, political scientists are talking about the decline of democracy, both trying to explain why (as Fukuyama puts it in his book Identity Politics) Identity analyzes how disadvantaged communities thrive), while also continuing to defend democracy (e.g. Przewski&#39;s Why Bother with Elections?). Canadian philosopher Charles Taylor also co-authored a new book with two scholars, &quot;Degenerations of Democracy&quot; (Harvard University Press, 2022), which adds to the literature that has emerged in recent years on the decline of democracy. , adding another important book. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before talking about the new book, let me first explain the background. Taylor wrote a masterpiece, &quot;A Secular Age&quot;, analyzing how the Western world evolved from the medieval era when &quot;no god was necessary&quot; to a secular era where God was &quot;all-powerful&quot;. The world experienced a helpless time. The historical process of looking back. Recognizing that history moves forward (rather than repeating ebbs and flows) is equally important to understanding the decline of democracy today. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Just as in the new book, the authors led by Taylor describe today&#39;s democracy as a &quot;degenerate&quot; rather than a &quot;retreat&quot;. To clarify the difference between the two words, the point I want to explain is that With the qualitative change of the democratic system, it will no longer be able to return to &quot;normal&quot; as before. It will not be regarded as the &quot;golden rule&quot; as before (that is, democratic countries have a transcendent status but non-democratic countries are eager to imitate it). The kind of system that was once The &quot;good days of democracy&quot; that briefly appeared are long gone from a global perspective. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another focus of the author in &quot;The Decline of Democracy&quot; is to define democracy as a telic concept. In other words: democracy is an ideal situation, but the world can never be so ideally democratic (It is defined by standards that can never be met). To move towards democracy, elections are certainly one of the keys, but the presence of elections certainly does not mean democracy (just like the lack of rotation of political parties in Japan does not mean the lack of local democracy), democratic elections must have the two qualities of &quot;free&quot; and &quot;fair&quot; Big conditions. In reality, there is never true and ultimate freedom and fairness, but there is often the possibility of being a little freer and a little fairer. Similarly, the author regards democracy as a goal in the book, either getting closer to democracy or moving further and further away. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Like other scholars of democratic theory, Taylor and other authors in &quot;The Decline of Democracy&quot; also hope to explain why the current world is contrary to democracy, and their answer is that the public has lost a kind of will that will change tomorrow. People feel they are deprived of the ability to make good lives for themselves and their families, so the public no longer has clear ideological preferences as before, but it is easier to resort to emotions and vent their dissatisfaction in life. Complaining collectively in small groups has become the greatest comfort in life. This is called populism. It is against this background that the democratic system has gradually changed from the past where everyone competed to pursue their own interests (agonistic), into an antagonistic arena. This is what the author calls the decline of democracy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If you want to ask how a democratic system can be brought back to life, the key must be to analyze the cause of death. The fundamental reason for the decline of the democratic system is the loss of the people&#39;s trust. If no one trusts any system, politics and political-related figures will only be hated by gods and ghosts. The author believes that ideal democracy is practiced through representative politics, that is, the people vote for political parties and authorize the formation of the government. The government is elected by one person and one vote. Everyone has a &quot;share&quot;, and the government therefore needs to be accountable to the people. However, scholars such as Charles Taylor revealed the miserable situation of democracy in the real world in &quot;The Decline of Democracy&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In political research, the decline of the democratic system and the people&#39;s indifference or even disgust with politics are not something that has only happened in recent years. It is only the situation that has taken a turn for the worse in recent years that has attracted more attention. The situation is exactly like global warming. It has been talked about for decades, but in recent years it has really started to feel like it has burned its heels. So now more people are coming out to speak out for the earth, but we know that the distance problem will be alleviated (let alone solved). The volume is still far from enough. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The same goes for democratic systems. The voting rates in old Western democracies have been low for decades, and political party support has also been deteriorating. Behind these things is that the democratic system and the people are getting further and further apart. The death of democracy will have as much impact on the world as global warming. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In &quot;The Decline of Democracy&quot;, the three authors describe the failed democratic system in reality: social inequality is infinitely magnified through the democratic system, and power and wealth are concentrated in a very small number of people. Regularly held elections and the political parties participating in them are to blame. The political parties themselves enjoy it, but (most) people don&#39;t actually feel it. Social development has become more diverse, but representative political parties have been unable to keep up. The opposition between left and right has left the people feeling indifferent. Political parties no longer represent the people, and a sense of powerlessness has enveloped the public. This is the key point that the author emphasizes repeatedly in the book: the people have lost their sense of accomplishment (efficacy). Who wants to get involved in politics when the “sacred vote” is effectively optional? The people&#39;s inefficacy is both the cause and the result of the decline of the democratic system. All problems are intertwined to form a vicious cycle. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When the system is incompetent and useless, populism, which allows people to share the same hatred and hatred, becomes extremely attractive. However, the author emphasizes very much in the book: populism is not the cause of the decline of democratic systems. Populism does indeed grow stronger when the democratic system is at its most fragile, but don’t forget that populism originally relied on the democratic system and mass mobilization. Forcibly treating populism as the biggest enemy actually ignores the root of the problem. If the democratic system is to be revived and active again, the most important thing to do is to re-inject a sense of achievement into the people and make them believe that the vote in their hands is not a piece of waste paper, but that they can really make a difference because of their vote. And elect a government that is responsible for itself and the country, but how to do it and is it possible? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In their book &quot;The Decline of Democracy&quot;, Taylor and others wrote that the democratic system was beyond recovery, but the great philosophers did not just end it irresponsibly. Before they concluded, they wrote that it might be The most important chapter of the book, &quot;What to do?&quot; attempts to propose four life-saving methods for the declining democratic system. I will briefly summarize them here. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The primary method is to restart democracy (Renew the Democratic Project). To put it simply and concisely, it is to re-respect the people of every country, because as mentioned before, one of the main reasons for the decline of democracy is that the people feel powerless and angry. For democracy to become an effective system, it must first make the people believe that they are part of the country again. That is to say, everyone&#39;s social background, blood culture, ideology and beliefs can be different, but the premise is that everyone should have the most basic and important thing in common - national identity, and use this identity to identify and transcend. and accommodate their differences. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, it is extremely difficult to achieve mutual respect between people. If you look at the long-standing card of &quot;immigration&quot; in Western countries, you will know how divided and exclusionary the reality is. But the author said that the connection between people can be achieved in many ways, and uniting the masses with emotions like populism is one of the ways; similarly, returning to the community and starting to cultivate people&#39;s sense of belonging in the community can also be used to unite the people with emotions. People unite. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The second way to save democracy is to Overcome Neoliberal Bias against the Public Good. Under marketism, public expenditures have been continuously reduced in recent decades. When the world is at peace, the world is at peace. But when a crisis occurs, public institutions can respond immediately to whatever extent they can withstand it, at the cost of countless lives. Adequate and effective public expenditure is also an important source of people&#39;s sense of belonging to the country. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The last two methods: Think Big and It Takes a Movement. Before establishing something, we must first break it. Since the democratic system is now outdated and ineffective, more powerful reforms are needed. After reading this, the biggest revelation for readers may not be that democracy can be saved, but that the problem of democratic decline is so serious that it is almost impossible to save, because all the methods mentioned by the author are far from reality. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Due to work needs, I recently stayed in Belgium and visited the European Parliament a few days ago. I talked about how the EU&#39;s democratic system is innovative, how to value the opinions of people of all countries, and how to embody the practice of democracy. But the reality is that Belgium is like other European and American cities: there are many homeless people on the streets, and there are people (and more than one) begging on every subway ride. I tried two rides back and forth on the same day, and I met the same person. A beggar is really destined, and I lament that my fate in Belgium actually fell on a beggar...&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What should I do? If you ignore various social problems, you will naturally not be able to gain the trust of the people. So is this book &quot;The Decline of Democracy&quot; worthless and just to release emotions? Not really. Do you remember the key point mentioned at the beginning of the book? Democracy is a &quot;telic concept&quot;. The ultimate democracy is just a goal. The people can always look at the benchmark and run straight. Even if we can never reach the benchmark, we can still get closer to the benchmark. distance between. Human beings grow old, sick and die, and governments and regimes come and go. If we can walk in the direction of democracy and freedom and try our best to bring the goal closer instead of farther away, even if it is only a small amount, it is considered progress. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 06 Dec 2023 12:25:19 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[“脱钩是一种‘双输’战略”：专访奥地利前总理沃尔夫冈·许塞尔]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261950]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-12-06 10:35:46&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&quot;I need a cup of coffee.&quot; At noon on December 3, 2023, before the official interview began, Xussel Again, stress this to your assistant. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From December 1st to 3rd, 78-year-old former Austrian Chancellor Wolfgang Schüssel spent three busy days in Guangzhou.

Usually we believe that market economy, free enterprise, private companies, etc., are complementary to freedom, openness, and pluralistic democracy. China, on the other hand, shows a different model. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Moreover, the Communist Party has a certain dynamic, an elitist management approach. They take the best and most talented people and then put those people to the test. If these people are successful, then they will be assigned to different positions again and then enter the next stage. This is a very interesting model. It&#39;s not our model, but it&#39;s a very effective model. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong style=&quot;color: #9a0000;&quot;>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;How does Europe view the rise of China? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Wolfgang Schüssel:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Generally speaking, the European people respect China’s peaceful rise very much. I am an economist. I remember when Deng Xiaoping came to power, China&#39;s GDP was less than 200 billion US dollars. Today, that number is $7 trillion. This is incredible growth. China has lifted hundreds of millions of people out of poverty, and their living conditions have now greatly improved. The “One Belt, One Road” initiative proposed by China is also playing an important role. So I think China plays an important role on the international stage and has huge influence. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We have great respect and admiration for the Chinese model. Of course, we have different views on our respective political systems, that&#39;s for sure. But no matter what, every country has the right to choose its own future, and China does not belong to Europe. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong style=&quot;color: #9a0000;&quot;>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;In recent times, Europe’s voice on China has not been positive. What is the reason behind this? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Wolfgang Schüssel:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;In the Russia-Ukraine conflict, one million people have been killed or disabled in the past two years. Mostly young people. Every day, missiles and drones rain down on Ukraine, destroying infrastructure, homes, and apartments. Today, the area where the battle was fought looks like the moon, a no-man&#39;s land. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So, I think both Europe and China should use their influence to stop this war and respect the sovereignty of independent countries. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;Decoupling&quot; is a &quot;lose-lose&quot; strategy&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong style=&quot;color: #9a0000;&quot;>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;What do you think? &quot;Decoupling theory&quot;? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Wolfgang Schüssel:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I am completely opposed to decoupling. it&#39;s out of the question. It is globalization and international trade that bring affluence and prosperity. According to customs figures, global trade has exploded over time. Globalization is good for China, good for Europe, good for the United States, and good for those less developed countries. So (decoupling) is absolutely impossible. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some research suggests that when decoupling actually occurs, it will cause a loss of more than 7% of global GDP. For countries that are more deeply integrated into global supply chains, decoupling will do more harm. Like China or Austria, Europe and the United States. Therefore, decoupling is really a “lose-lose” strategy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong style=&quot;color: #9a0000;&quot;>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Are de-risking and decoupling the same? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Wolfgang Schüssel: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;De-risking is different. I know some people suggest that these two statements are consistent, but in fact they are not the same. De-risking refers to the reluctance of people to rely heavily on a single partner. Take the COVID-19 pandemic, for example. Suddenly, we saw a shortage of medical equipment. Moreover, due to the trade blockade, all channels have been closed. We have no medicines from India and no masks from China. De-risking means you have to leave some protection areas in place to protect your people, just in case. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As another example, in terms of energy, we cannot completely rely on Russia. We have to diversify our sources. If someone blew up the pipeline in Austria, or Ukraine or Russia stopped the Nord Stream 1 pipeline, everything would be ruined. No energy, no electricity, you can imagine what that means for the economy. So, you have to diversify. China is also de-risking. China needs to maintain sovereignty in data, supply chains, etc. This is completely understandable, and we will do the same. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another example is national defense. The Europeans have outsourced national defense to the Americans. Trump said that we will eventually leave NATO and Europe will be responsible for itself. This is what de-risking means. We have to invest more in our own defense because in a crisis you have to protect your own people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What should you do if you suddenly encounter cyber hackers, surprise attacks, or blockades? What about your government, your site, your hospital, your energy company? Just like a company, we analyze potential risks in all directions of the company from a professional perspective - including paying attention to usage context, technical risks, external risks, market risks, etc. Every company will protect itself from risks, and the government must do the same . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong style=&quot;color: #9a0000;&quot;>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;In recent years, China has emphasized high-level opening up. What opportunities do you think this will bring? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Wolfgang Schüssel:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I think China’s opening up to the outside world is very important. Two factors struck me during the discussions at this conference. The first one is that a Chinese friend suggested that China is now focusing on developing a unified domestic market, such as managing the financial market, allocation, lending standards, etc. in all provinces with the same rules. This is exactly what the EU has always wanted to do but has not quite done yet. And once we complete that, it will be a huge catalyst for new growth. So, China is also following the same path. If China provides a large-scale market for its consumers and industrial partners, this is a major benefit for all of us. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The second point is that China is now committed to developing regional trade with ASEAN countries, which will also help Europe. Because I know that many companies in Europe are also interested in establishing ties with ASEAN countries. In many cases, people cannot accurately tell where a product comes from. For example, if you look at my smartphone, it contains 700-800 different components. They may be from Vietnam, Thailand, China, the United States, etc. As another example, my Audi car is made up of 900 different parts. It&#39;s assembled in Mexico, its engine comes from Slovakia, the gasoline comes from Hungary, parts come from China, and some elements come from Germany. So, this isn&#39;t just a &quot;German car&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So I think this kind of inter-regional cooperation is beneficial. Moreover, cooperation enhances neighborly relations. For example, the EU intends to integrate the Western Balkan countries into the EU. Thirty years ago, a bloody war broke out in the Balkans. If Serbia develops cooperative trade with Croatia, Slovenia, etc., it will &quot;force&quot; peace. Therefore, I believe that inter-regional cooperation is conducive to prosperity, conducive to peace, and conducive to a harmonious future. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“In short, we need to cooperate”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong style=&quot;color: #9a0000;&quot;>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;In 2020, Austria’s first trip from The China-Europe train from Vienna to Xi&#39;an sets off. How do you evaluate the impact of China-Europe freight trains on Austria? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Wolfgang Schüssel:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;China-Europe freight trains are very important. Shipping containers by rail is much faster and more environmentally friendly than shipping by sea. Although shipping is cheap, it does have more negative impacts in terms of environmental pollution and carbon dioxide emissions. So in my opinion, rail transportation is one of the elements of the future, which can both reduce costs and make cooperation more effective. Such applications have been very successful in Germany. If you look at the actual data, you will find that trade is growing positively, and it is not the so-called &quot;deglobalization&quot; or &quot;decoupling&quot; trend. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; Southern Weekend: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_gb2312, stkaiti;&quot;>; What do you think of changes in Sino-US relations? &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; Wolfgang Xuyerel: &lt;/strong>; First of all, 80%of the world&#39;s population is neither Chinese nor American. Therefore, I think that China -US cooperation is not the only cooperation needed by both parties. In my opinion, we should really be committed to promoting European cooperation with China. At present, we are looking for and working together. By the way, there is the same interests as China. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; At the same time, the multi -pole world needs good operations, such as the United Nations and the World Trade Organization. This is important. If there is a problem, arbitration is always better than bilateral tensions. This is our interests. First of all, it is important to restore military contact because no one wants to create an accident, but it may happen. Similarly, what we need is a polar world, not a bipolar world. If there are some effective international institutions, this may be beneficial to all of us. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; A few weeks ago, the Sino -US summit held a meeting in San Francisco, and I was very optimistic about it. This is a positive step towards cooperation. We should look forward to a positive and bright future, because the world needs such a future, and we also face common problems, such as climate change, financial problems, inflation, regional conflicts, and so on. All in all, we need to cooperate. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong style = &quot;color: #9A0000;&quot;>; Southern Weekend: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span>; Do you think Austria or Europe will choose to choose a team? &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; Wolfgang Xu Sel: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span>; The boat to the bridge is naturally straight. I believe that the leaders of both sides are rational politicians. In my opinion, good political measures always take the well -being of the people. The happiness of the people means prosperity, meaning peace, and employment, which means a good status when competing with other countries -of course, this must be peaceful and economical. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; At this meeting, we mourned Henry Kissinger. He is one of the designers of such a good policy. He was born in Germany and was expelled away. (He) is a refugee from Nazi Germany to the United States, but later he became a historian and the advocate of peaceful cooperation. It&#39;s not a positive confrontation, but to work together. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; We have also recently commemorated the late Prime Minister Li Keqiang. He founded a forum connecting Europe and China about 10 years ago to develop innovative worldviews and discuss the overall plan to solve related related issues. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; I think they are our role model and teach us how to deal with difficult moments. This is what we see today, but we should not be pessimistic. We should make a positive future possible. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_GB2312, stkaiti;&quot;>; (Southern Weekend Intern Zhang Xinyi also contributed to this article) &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; /p>; &lt;p>; &lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 06 Dec 2023 10:55:03 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[聚焦丨2023年“读懂中国”国际会议（广州）]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261802]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;i>; 2023-12-06 10:06:20 &lt;/i>; &lt;/div>; From December 1st to 3rd, 2023 &quot;Understanding China&quot; International Conference (Guangzhou) held at the Yuexiu International Conference Center , Domestic and foreign guests from more than 30 countries and regions exchanged discussions.

He was admitted to the Department of History of Tsinghua University in 1935 and was taught by professors such as Yu Pingbo, Chen Yinque, Qian Mu, Jin Yuelin and other professors. In 1948, he went to study in the UK. In 1955, he was invited by French Sinologist Bai Leri to help the &quot;Song History Research Plan&quot; and write &quot;Song of the Song Dynasty Characters and the first year record&quot;. Since then, he has successively served as professors of the Department of Chinese Department of Bonulor University in Germany, the Department of Oriental Language of the University of Wisconsin, and the History Department of Nanyang University in Singapore. The publishing includes &quot;The History of Chinese Science and Technology&quot;, &quot;The Examination of Yilin Cong&quot;, and &quot;Siku Subscribe to Pickup&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Mr. Weng Tongwen is a famous internationally renowned Chinese literature and history scholar. , History of art, the history of science and technology, and many fields, the outstanding achievements and the extensive quilts of achievements are all known in the world. I was too late to enter school, and I felt regrettable due to the obstruction of both sides of the strait. Recently, Taishun held a meeting to commemorate Mr. Weng to discuss Mr. Weng&#39;s achievements. Professor Cheng Wu Songdi showed his two huge books and watched it a little. It is particularly admired by Mr. Weng&#39;s in his later years, and he has a lot of donations. He has not forgotten his grace, publishing a collection of publishing, and commemorating discussions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; I have no chance to meet with Mr. Weng, and there are very few intersections in the field of academic fields. , I also felt the enthusiastic invitation of Professor Wu Songdi. The heart of Taishun&#39;s organizer had been practiced, and he was trapped in academics. When he was trapped by miscellaneous things, he would not be able to read the shallow experience of reading &quot;Weng Tong Wen Wen Ji&quot;. . Slightly Chen Xiangxiang, honor the former philosophy. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>; I. &quot;Siku Timming Pickup&quot;: Traditional reading notes with a high heart &lt;/h4>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Let&#39;s talk about the more familiar literature research research first Take the fifth editor of the essay &quot;Siku Subsida to Pickup&quot; as an example. In this part of the eighty -eight articles, most of the writing of traditional books, most of them are simpler. It records that the schools that have been misunderstood in the &quot;Siku Timination&quot; are scheduled. There are several articles, and they are very deep. In the first test of the three volumes of &quot;Pei&quot; in the early Song of the Song Dynasty, Guo Zhongshu&#39;s &quot;Pei&quot;, discussed the presence of the &quot;Song History&quot; Zhongshu Biography, and believed that the quotation of the cites and the passage of the pass and the &quot;Song History of the Song Dynasty&quot; were very different. It was originally unbroken, so he would be misunderstood by Zhongshi in the shogunate of Liu Xun, Xiangyin Gong. Then, on the record of the Five Dynasties of the Song Dynasty today, restore the life of Guo Zhongshu, restore the large end, criticize Zhongshu as &quot;no wine, and people with many people&quot;, and unveil the kingdom. Nai Zhongshu&#39;s book, his contribution has its own outwardness. For the four libraries and eight volumes of Yuan Xinwenfang&#39;s &quot;Biography of the Tang Caizi&quot;, there are many words. Weng Kao has a particularly valuable historical material, that is, revealed that Yuan Ma Zuchang&#39;s &quot;Shitian Collection&quot; Volume 2 has &quot;Title Xin Liang Shi&quot; Sand Collection &quot;&quot;: &quot;Can&#39;t pick sand, gold is from many. Long song. Qiusai Mingxing frost armor, the spring house cuts the painting Luo, and the groan becomes the remaining hair. Xiao Se is Yin He. &quot;Therefore, Mr. Weng knew that Xin had&quot; The Collection of Poems in the Sands &quot;and commented:&quot; Yin He, Yin, He Xunye also . In comparison, the depth of Xu Xun is not confused with Wang Zhiqian and other names, and Yang Zai and others advocate them. &quot; &quot;>; (&quot; Collection &quot;misrepresents this paragraph as the common saying of Matsu) &lt;/span>; This is important for understanding the level and achievement of Xin Wenfang, who understands the most diligent in the Tang Dynasty poetry, is very important. After the Song Zhang Tang and Tang Ying&#39;s &quot;Shu Yan&quot;, the original book was the original book as ten volumes. There are only more than two hundred words in the whole article, and the information contains is extremely rich. Basic judgments can be believed by faith. The five volumes of &quot;Luoyang Galan&quot;, which have been mixed in the text. Since the Qing Dynasty, many scholars hope that such as the ancestor&#39;s &quot;Water Sutra&quot; will be precipitated. Tang Yan&#39;s &quot;Hook Shen&quot;, recently Fan Xiangyong&#39;s &quot;School Note&quot;, Zhou Zemo&#39;s &quot;School Interpretation&quot; and Xu Gao Ruan&#39;s &quot;Re -issue&quot;, believed that Xu Shu &quot;Bo Cai&#39;s various family members and later lived up&quot;, but the historical affairs did not comment. In this regard, I know Fan and the family on Tuesday. It has far surpassed the booking of &quot;Siku&#39;s Summary&quot;, and five or six hundred words can be read as the gains and losses of the &quot;Galan Ji&quot;. In order to publish it, Yu Jiaxi&#39;s &quot;Explanation&quot; enjoys the name, and his studies are particularly concerned about the authors and the original book of the author of the Song and Yuan Dynasties. Mr. Weng Tongwen also pays attention to the history of the Song and Yuan Dynasties. He discusses each of the &quot;Ai Ri Zhai Cong Banknote&quot; at the end of the ends of the &quot;Ai Ri Zhai Cong Banknote&quot;. The unknown of Yu Shu, Wang Yan, the author of &quot;Tang Yulin&quot;, and Yu Shuo invented. Mr. Weng Tongwen even read Su Shi&#39;s &quot;Wang Dannian&quot; as his father, and knew that he was out of the family. The age is from the 长. There are many wonderful places such as this and cannot be listed one by one. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;img img-id = &quot;73967&quot; group-id = &quot;0&quot; asset-id = &quot;70758&quot; src = &quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23 /12/05/101090EF9A.jpg &quot;Img-Title =&quot; WeChat Pictures .com/cms/Medias/Image/23/12/05/101090EF9A.jpg &quot;data-key =&quot; 260816 &quot;style =&quot; &quot;>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style =&quot; color: #999999; text-align: center ; &quot;>; In 1936, Weng Tongwen (first from left) and his family in Xi&#39;an. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>; 2. Publishing history research: China&#39;s contribution in Western academic vision &lt;/h4>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; &quot;Weng Tong Wen Wen Ji&quot; third editor &quot;Research on Science and Technology History and Culture History Research &quot;, Twenty -one deposit, one of which talks about colonial silkworms, eleven articles about publishing history, two articles talk about the customs of chair, one talk about the history of gunpowder, one talked about the corpse of the Han and corpses, the other is the other, one Talking about Tang people&#39;s observation of genetic phenomena, the other four talked about exchanges between society and culture, involving a wide range. The most direct impression is that Mr. Weng is a very deep traditional scholar who reads Chinese books. However, because he has been studying and teaching in the West for a long time, his research interest and narrative position have been fundamentally different from traditional scholars. Regardless Seeing the book, there are unique understanding and disclosure in the world, there are many inventions, the evidence is accurate, and the conclusion of the new police is reliable. It is the common characteristic of this group of papers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; First talk about the relevant publishing history. From writing books to publishing, the Tang Dynasty was a critical period. In the end, when did the earliest engraving? Because of the discovery of the Dunhuang testament and the new opinion literature, the earliest journal was about Shu in Shuzong. As for South Korea&#39;s discovery of the sutra with the new words of the Hou Hou, there are still controversy in the period of publishing. Mr. Weng Tongwen has different writing time before and after writing, but it involves more detail interpretation and literature inventions. In preparation, it is more inspiring. &quot;The word&quot; Model &quot;in the pen with the History of Printing History is really 诂&quot; is a large article analyzed from a young age. In the fourth year of the four years of Yuanqing, the &quot;Bai&#39;s Changqing Collection&quot; was written in December. It is believed that &quot;Model&quot; refers to the moment printing. In modern times, Hu Shi advocates particularly, and as many as the writer is as many as 20 or 30 people, only three people such as Da Da opposed that &quot;Mo Le&quot; refers to the double -line hook white white Copy technology of poetry ink. Mr. Weng agreed to say that from the analysis of the source of the language and the interpretation of the two characters in the past, hoping that the future researchers will no longer be troubled by this word. His argumentation process is extremely tight, and there are two unexpected harvests. One is to compare the word &quot;mold&quot; and &quot;mold writing, molding, molding, molding, and molds that have appeared in the Eastern Han Dynasty. &quot;The technique of creating a compound book on paper according to the text pen or ink original model&quot;, the second is to demonstrate the new term that &quot;Model&quot; appears in the middle of the Tang Dynasty. This testimony seems trivial, in fact, it solves the ambiguity of the interpretation of a large number of literatures involving the issue of version engraving, and the conclusions are fully credible. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; &quot;The earliest self-carved poetry collection is the Tang Dynasty Shu Yong&quot;, which is not long, but it is extremely fun. The earliest poetry collection of &quot;Siku Tip&quot; is the former Shu Guanxiu. Title &quot;Zen Moon Collection&quot;. &quot;This preface was written in the former Shu Gande &lt;span style =&quot; font-family: regular body, regular body_GB2312, SIMKAI, stkaiti; &quot;>; (923) &lt;/span>; Molly. Ye Dehui&#39;s &quot;Shu Lin Qing Wa&quot; According to &quot;The History of the Five Dynasties · He Chuan&quot;, there is &quot;there are hundreds of volumes. Mr. Weng believes that he is later than Guanxiu, and his engraving is not absolutely agreed. He revealed a ignored record from &quot;North Dream Words&quot;, namely Zhao Zongshi Jinshi Chen Yong, and his poem first pair of words cloud: &quot;The oxen of the partitioned bulls floats the nose, and the creek sand bird nods.&quot; Taoist Du Guangting Tingting Questioning, these two sentences are not good, &quot;Why should this be the first?&quot; Chen Yong replied: &quot;Once awarded the Guigui, so engraved it at the head of the roll.&quot; The case of the collection of Shu carved poetry. It is absolutely earlier than the Guanxiu. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; &quot;The earliest publisher in the history of the world in the middle of the middle of the middle of the night&quot;, first confirming that there is a book sale book in the end of the Tang Dynasty in the end of the Tang Dynasty in the end of the Tang Dynasty in the end of the Tang Dynasty. The reward in Chengdu, Chengdu, who sells Buddhist spells in Longchifang, has mentioned in the discussion of Zhang Xiumin, Li Shuhua, and Qian Cunxun. Changan Books, Chen Yilong has tested and two books with the surname of Li. Mr. Weng also cited the &quot;Mrs. Cui Family Training Girls&quot; as the banknotebook, but at the end, the &quot;Shangdu Li Family Print&quot; was written as a banknote. I have read this volume again and again. What I call &quot;Bai Shi Lang Zan&quot; is the name of Bai Juyi, and the work may not be published in Bai Juyi&#39;s life. The second is the &quot;New Collection Preparation of Moxibustion Sutra&quot; in the second six, six -seven five five, and the eight characters of &quot;Li Family in Beijing in the East City&quot;. Third, it is a printed printed product of the 8010. In the end, there is a cross with the &quot;big knife of the East City in the Urban City&quot;. It is believed that it also belongs to the bookstore or publisher with the &quot;big knife&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Two articles about the printing of the live characters, in addition to the verification of the Bi Sheng inventing muddy character printing in the &quot;Mengxi Bi Tan&quot; In the real life, what inspiration of his muddy character skills is generated. Among them, the particularly wonderful is &quot;suspicion and its effectiveness caused by the mud&quot;, and &quot;the edition of the living characters before the late Qing Dynasty failed to replace the carving version&quot;. According to the record, the former was recorded in the two hundred years after Bi Sheng. Try to try, but there is no big development. Mr. Weng&#39;s explanation was that although Bi Sheng was invented before, he had a wireless inheritance in the future, but everyone continued to start from zero, and never overcome the shortcomings of the rough and rough living characters. Although China has invented living characters, it has not replaced the carving printing until after the Western technology is introduced, and Fang has fundamental changes. &quot;The invention of the European Living Edition is also induced by carving printing&quot;. Before the 15th century, Germany Genbao promoted the principles of living characters, Europeans tried the road of printing skills. Special seeing high -frequency re -engraved letters make Westerners easier to get ideas. The Chinese carving printing method is even more prominent in inspiration of Europeans. Although this article is mostly speculated, the basic insights are still within a reasonable range, and what they see is quite reasonable. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; In addition, the life of the life of Chen Qi, the Southern Song Dynasty, and the script of the book of the southern Song Dynasty, It is a major key figure in the history of Chinese Indian books. It is clear that reading is unlikely. &quot;The cost of reducing the cost of books in prints&quot; is also an interesting topic. I am even more interested in the interesting story of the essay about the gods Wu Caiyu&#39;s book &quot;Tang Yun&quot;.

Among them, six chairs appeared east of the Six Dynasties at the end of the Six Dynasties at the end of the Six Dynasties. His inspection of the special shape of the chair also has the same conclusion and proves that most of them are related to the monk&#39;s temple, pointing out that the rope bed is a tool for monks to sit in meditation, and some monks have developed the habit of lying on their lives, and most monks are mostly monks.

Mr. Weng Tongwen was a generation of scholars born in the beginning of the Republic of China. His research path continues until the end of the 20th century. When he was born, the Qing Dynasty had died, but the four parts were the foundation of the sutra, and the poetry was moisturized. Still Yu Xu. However, the trend since the beginning of the Republic of China has strongly advocated that Western studies to explore the path to the country&#39;s development, and also guide people and writers to work hard to accept the number of western academic roads and explore various new studies related to the society and society. Mr. Weng Tongwen was originally educated at the Southwest University, Yunnan University and St. John University, studying and work and work in Britain, France, Germany, the United States, and New countries, and finally served the university in Taiwan. His studies are rooted in tradition, and his vision and methods are deeply influenced by Western studies. He combines literature with cultural relics to fully integrate society and life. He pays special attention to the lower society, special skills and basic classics.

Photo by Southern Weekend reporter Gao Yichen&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The car stopped at the location where the name of the village was marked on the electronic map, with mountains on one side and cliffs on the other. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The driver carefully turned around, turned in through the overlooked gap, and drove through three turns on the newly found path and around two mountains. The ravine between them reaches the other side of the mountain. This is the destination - a remote village within the jurisdiction of Jingning County, Pingliang City, Gansu Province, where the electronic map failed to include the correct location. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Looking from a distance, this village almost looks like it grows on an earthy hillside, with buildings with red roofs and white walls stacked on top of each other around the mountainside. On November 16, 2023, the village was sparsely populated. The snow has melted, and an elderly couple is working in the fields, planning to hoe the soil to grow potatoes. The apples that the locals are proud of have been picked and sold, and the village is about to enter a slack period. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Nine days ago, a person close to the village was executed. His name is Zhang Longji, born in Jingning County in 1979, with a university education. According to the announcement of the Pingliang Intermediate Court, from 2010 to June 2019, when he served as the teaching director, principal and teacher of a primary school in Jingning County, he used corporal punishment and other means to form a mental coercion on primary school students who lacked sexual defense ability. He used explanation exercises, When students handed in homework and other opportunities, they repeatedly raped 5 young girls aged 8 to 12 years old in their dormitories, and repeatedly raped 17 girls aged 8 to 14 years old in public in the classroom or in their dormitories. Child molestation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Perhaps to protect the privacy of the victim, the court did not disclose the name of the elementary school where Zhang Longji taught. Southern Weekend reporters learned that the primary school where the incident occurred was the village primary school in the aforementioned village and had been withdrawn and merged in 2019. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;When the news that &quot;a primary school principal raped and molested 22 girls in 9 years&quot; caused an uproar on the Internet, this village in the eye of the storm seemed particularly silent. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;A small village in the mountains&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Especially in our village, don&#39;t ask about these things.&quot; Upon hearing Zhang Longji&#39;s name, villager Zhang Bi Peng&#39;s tone became stern. On November 16, 2023, he stood at the gate of the hospital and waved his hands to the Southern Weekend reporter as if to drive him away. &quot;It&#39;s all my sad past.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Zhang Bipeng’s yard is only a few hundred meters away from the original site of the primary school where the incident occurred. Only the couple lives at home, and his father, Zhang Pinghe, takes care of his grandson in Jingning County. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Zhang Pinghe is the old principal of the primary school where the incident occurred. He has taught in the village for more than 40 years and has now retired. On social platforms, he is called &quot;Perseverance in the Mountains.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Today, the empty and abandoned school building remains at the north end of the village. The gate is locked from the outside and cannot be entered. The outside of the courtyard is filled with corn stalks as high as the wall. Compared with the picture that appeared in the news ten years ago, the red roof of the elementary school bungalow still looks the same, and the exterior wall has turned white, as if it had been painted and repaired in the last few years, and the windows and doors are sealed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The yard next to the school is still open. There are only two old houses. One is piled with props for celebrating the New Year and the lion dance. The other has several An old, dusty wooden table with medals hanging on the wall. Among the dead branches and weeds, there are two green basketball hoops. A villager said that this area is the school playground. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The villager introduced that the primary school was merged in 2019, and then the children in the village went to the central primary school in the town. It was the first boarding school in the town. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Before the merger, this rural primary school was once a model in Jingning County. Among more than a dozen schools in the township, it ranked among the top three in performance every year. There are not many people in the school. When Sun Chuning, a staff member of the Jingning County Education Bureau, visited in 2015, there were only 29 students and 5 teachers in the school. Many students go to towns or counties with their migrant parents. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In 2015, Zhang Pinghe was still the principal, one or two years away from retirement. Sun Chuning had a good impression of the old principal, &quot;Teacher Zhang has been taking care of the school for decades, both during winter and summer vacations.&quot; He said he did not know Zhang Longji and did not pay attention to his situation when he visited the school. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The old principal has been commended repeatedly. According to public reports, he once took teachers to quarry clay to paint classrooms, went to a forest farm to collect waste materials to make simple tables and stools, and stayed at the school building to dig canals to divert water during heavy rains. Some netizens said in the comment area that in their memory, even the wife of the old principal pulled a trolley and worked in the school. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;A Pingliang photographer once shot a short film for the old principal when he was about to retire. He said that the photo was taken for &quot;awards and competitions&quot;. At the end of the film, the words &quot;Produced by Jingning County Education Bureau&quot; appear. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;At the same time, Zhou Lan, a school-age student who lived in a nearby village, came to this primary school to study. The school&#39;s reputation is one of the reasons why parents choose the school, but more importantly, it is almost his &quot;only solution&quot; for transportation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The surrounding area is inconvenient and there is no public transportation. Students measure distance by round-trip walking time, and anything that can be reached by walking in 30 minutes is considered &quot;very close.&quot; The map shows that Zhou Lan has to walk about 7 kilometers to the central primary school in the town, which takes an hour and a half on foot. At that time, &quot;there was an age requirement for living in school there, and you had to be in fifth grade or fourth grade.&quot; So Zhou Lan could only attend this village primary school. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The grandchildren of the old principal did not study in this village primary school, but were sent to the county town and are now studying in high school. Zhang Bipeng explained that it was because “the conditions in the county are good.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The number of teachers and students in rural primary schools is constantly decreasing. At its peak, the school had more than 200 students. A few years before Zhou Lan enrolled, there were more than 100 people in the school. “There were quite a lot of people at that time, but they all left in the end.” In a school evaluation and acceptance self-inspection report filled out by Zhang Pinghe in 2016, the school had only 21 students and 4 faculty members, divided into 4 teaching classes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The report states that the primary school was founded in 1957. It was expanded into a standardized primary school on the original site in 2002 and changed to a six-year complete primary school in 2003. The old principal wrote this paragraph in the report: The school carefully organizes teachers and students to study education laws and regulations, teachers&#39; law, and the Law on the Protection of the Rights and Interests of Minors. All teachers and students in the school know, understand and abide by the law. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Zhang Longji is one of the above-mentioned teachers. A relevant roster of Jingning County in 2014 shows that Zhang Longji was a professional technical level 12 and a primary school teacher level 2 at that time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In 2017, Zhang Longji took over as the principal of this village primary school. The transfer of teachers in rural schools is the responsibility of the local education bureau. The principal of a rural primary school in Gansu said that the position of principal must go through layers of selection before being qualified, including examinations and background training. “Each unit has to go through it again. For example, if there is a problem with your credit card, you will not be allowed to pass. , particularly strict.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;According to the court notice, Zhang Longji had been committing crimes for several years at this time. Why didn’t Zhang Longji’s actions attract attention during this period? As of press time, Zhang Pinghe had not responded to Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Jingning County Education Bureau stated that the relevant details involve the protection of minors, so it is inconvenient to disclose them. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“I didn’t understand it at that time, so I saw it as a joke”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;When Zhou Lan was studying in this village primary school, he saw Zhang Longji with his own eyes He molested students in the classroom, but felt he had no choice but to do anything about it because &quot;he is the principal.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;After the school was annexed and the school building was locked, Zhou Lan and several male classmates secretly climbed over the wall and entered. He said that Zhang Longji had two dormitories at the school, one of which belonged to his wife. The couple has two girls and one boy, and their three children sometimes come to live in the dormitory. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Zhou Lan said that he and his classmates tore off the seal on the dormitory door and held a &quot;special ceremony&quot; inside. According to the video sent by Zhou Lan, they placed a photo on a low table, placed three small trays in front of the photo, placed chocolate pie on it, and burned paper on the side. Before Zhang Longji&#39;s execution, this &quot;ceremony&quot; with the meaning of memorial was a kind of revenge. They have been held three times in total, the last time in October 2023. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Zhou Lan hated this teacher in her heart. He said that Zhang Longji often corporally punished and beat students, and he was very cruel. &quot;He took a stick and hit me on the head, (beating) to death, which cast a shadow on me.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;They are the last batch of students Zhang Longji taught and are now in junior high school. Zhou Lan recalled that before the incident in 2019, there were only three girls left in the school, and some had transferred away before. Zhang Longji would molest girls in front of him. When correcting homework in class, he would also call girls to the podium and molest them in public. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;He also heard from girls in the school that Zhang Longji would call them to the dormitory. When school was over in the evening, Zhang Longji would use excuses such as &quot;the homework was not finished&quot; to prevent female students from going home and keep them until after nine o&#39;clock in the evening. He said that he was still young at the time and had little idea of ​​what Zhang Longji did. He only thought it was strange and did not tell his parents. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;What Zhou Lan saw was just the tip of the iceberg. During an interview with Southern Weekend reporters, we learned that the incident of being molested by Zhang Longji was probably earlier than the time mentioned in the court notice and had occurred since his early years of teaching. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;From 2004 to 2005, Lulu was in the first grade of a primary school in the town, and Zhang Longji, who was about 25 years old at the time, was her math teacher. She recalled to Southern Weekend reporters that at that time the school was a bungalow and it was very cold in winter, so they used stoves to burn charcoal for heating. During math class, Zhang Longji would call a female student to the podium, hold her in his arms, and &quot;do some very intimate gestures&quot; in front of thirty or forty students in the class, in the name of checking her homework. She said that she had personally seen several girls in the class being hugged, and &quot;he would pick some of the prettier little girls.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Lulu herself is also a victim. Zhang Longji held her in his arms and breathed into her, &quot;I felt very strange, so I hid.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;By 2009, Professor Zhang Longji’s subject changed from mathematics to English. That year, Zhang Lei, a male student, was in the third grade. During class, Zhang Longji held the girl in his arms and taught her vocabulary, touched her face, and behaved affectionately. He saw a female classmate sitting on Zhang Longji&#39;s lap with a look of disgust on her face. Forced by the teacher&#39;s authority, she did not dare to make any big moves to resist. She could only twist her body to avoid his physical contact, but it did not have much effect. “I didn’t understand it at that time, so I just took it as a joke.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In the same year, during a break in class, fifth-grade Lin Ling said that she was lying on her back in class. When she was sleeping on the table, there were many students in the classroom, and Zhang Longji suddenly hugged her from behind. Lin Ling was frightened and quickly said, &quot;Hurry up and let me go.&quot; He let go. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;According to the accounts of former students, Zhang Longji’s obscene behavior lasted for a long time, and students of different grades were victimized. &quot;He should have been molesting girls since he first joined the workforce... My last class, my current class, my next class, including my sister&#39;s class all know about it.&quot; November 2023 , Lin Ling told Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Lin Ling said that female students did not dare to get along with Zhang Longji and were afraid of being hugged by him. They felt &quot;especially annoying&quot; and privately complained to each other &quot;Why is he That’s it again”. &quot;But we didn&#39;t even realize at the time that he was breaking the law.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Ignored help&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The first female students Zhang Longji molested Have tried to save myself. Lulu, who was 7 years old at the time, told her mother about this &quot;strange thing&quot;. Her mother didn&#39;t take it seriously and just thought it was an elder&#39;s love for children. &quot;She said that your math teacher thinks you are very good and feels sorry for you.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;During the parent-teacher conference, Zhang Longji would face Lulu’s mother Praise her and say that the little girl is &quot;very smart and well-behaved&quot;. Lulu analyzed that this strengthened her mother&#39;s judgment and made her feel that the young mathematics teacher was very responsible and appreciated her daughter, without any warning. Looking back, Lulu feels that rural parents “are very lacking in awareness in this regard.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Lin Ling agreed with this analysis. She euphemistically said that the adults in the village are relatively simple, traditional and conservative. Lin Ling, who was 12 years old at the time, told her mother that there was a teacher in school who always hugged female classmates during class and also hugged herself, but the answer she received was unexpected. &quot;My mother said that my thoughts were not sincere.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Talking about the memory of asking her parents for help in fifth grade to no avail, the adult Lin Ling hesitated for a few seconds. ,Sighed. &quot;Maybe he has a better personality, but the adults don&#39;t believe it.&quot; She told her mother two or three times, but when she saw her mother&#39;s reaction, she stopped mentioning it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In front of children and adults, Zhang Longji has two different faces. When facing students, he sometimes kissed and hugged them, and sometimes violently punished them. But when facing adults, in Lulu&#39;s words, he behaved politely and responsibly, &quot;it&#39;s quite invisible.&quot; His WeChat avatar is an ID photo with a red background, a Chinese character face, single eyelids, a wide nose, a smile, wearing a black suit and a red polka dot tie, and his hair is meticulously combed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Where Zhang Longji grew up, the villagers also had a good impression of him. Compared with the remote teaching villages, Xiaohe Village in Gangou Town, where Zhang Longji&#39;s home is located, is closer to Jingning County and has convenient transportation. In the eyes of the villagers, Zhang Longji is one of the few &quot;top students&quot; who has gone to university, with high academic qualifications and decent work. &lt;br>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;A villager said that Zhang Longji and his two sisters were both college students. After graduation, they earned money and renovated old houses in the village. A building was bought in the county seat. Zhang Longji&#39;s wife is a teacher. &quot;His wife is teaching. She is slim (dialect means thin) and her family is in good condition.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Now the Zhang family&#39;s house is vacant, the iron door is rusty and locked, unused bricks are piled in the inner courtyard, and the red paper on the porch has faded. The courtyard is scattered with yellow leaves floating off the branches. The above-mentioned villagers said with some sadness that Zhang Longji&#39;s family was poor when he was a child. The shoes his mother wore were made of rags without uppers. His father sold rapeseed and raised three college students with hard work.

Photo by Southern Weekend reporter Gao Yichen&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The last time the villagers saw Zhang Longji was in 2019. Some villagers remember that in April of that year, an old man died in the village, and Zhang Longji returned to the village to &quot;carry and bury the person.&quot; He was in &quot;good condition&quot; at the time, but he did not expect that the crime of rape and molestation was about to be exposed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;More than a month later, Zhang Longji was taken away by the police during the Dragon Boat Festival after a victim&#39;s family called the police. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Zhang Longji still has relatives who run a supermarket in Xiaohe Village. He said that Zhang Longji rarely returned to the village after settling in the county, and there was not much contact between the two parties. &quot;After the old man (Zhang Longji&#39;s parents) disappeared, he would not come back for a year or two. When he came back, he would have a quick meeting and we would not chat.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; >;He refused to recall when he learned that Zhang Longji molested students. &quot;These things have happened, and now everyone here knows that there is such a person. There are some things that we can&#39;t talk about in depth, can&#39;t say, and don&#39;t want to say.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; A 64-year-old villager still has a good impression of Zhang Longji, thinking that he is a decent person and behaves &quot;stablely.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;He may have never seen Zhang Longji&#39;s ruthless side. According to the students&#39; accounts, both boys and girls were beaten by Zhang Longji, and iron rods, steel bars, and mops were all &quot;weapons.&quot; A boy recalled that when he was 9 years old and in third grade, he was beaten so hard that he &quot;couldn&#39;t sit still for a month, and his buttocks were all black.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Violence makes seeking help more difficult. Lin Ling remembers that when he was in first grade, Zhang Longji kicked a boy from the front of the podium to the back of the classroom. &quot;No one dared to resist, really. Because he beat people so fiercely, we didn&#39;t dare to say anything.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;I never mentioned the past injuries again&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt; p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The most difficult time for Lin Ling to let go was watching her friend being hurt by Zhang Longji. One day when she was in the fourth or fifth grade, during extracurricular activities, she and her friends went to Zhang Longji&#39;s dormitory to hand in homework. Zhang just came back from playing ball and was naked in the dormitory, wearing only shorts. &quot;When we handed in our homework, he hugged my classmate and kissed him hard there. It scared me. I ran away quickly.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left; &quot;>;There were no other teachers around at that time. Lin Ling ran out and told another classmate what happened. The two comforted each other and said, &quot;It should be fine.&quot; About 10 minutes later, the classmate who was hugged came out of Zhang Longji&#39;s dormitory. Lin Ling asked about her situation, and the reply she received was &quot;nothing.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;I was very worried about that classmate of mine, but when we were young, we didn&#39;t dare to say anything.&quot; Lin Ling recalled. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;That memory became the shadow of her childhood. She always remembered that the female classmate who was being hugged was trying to resist and try to break free, but she was only a primary school student, thin and not very strong. Zhang Longji kept holding her and kissed her on the mouth. It was only after Lin Ling grew up that she realized, &quot;Every time we hand in homework or do anything else, we have to go to his separate dormitory.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Things are buried deep in the hearts of the two girls. &quot;I know (that incident did) a lot of harm to my classmate, but until now I haven&#39;t dared to ask her. She is now married, and the matter has never been mentioned again.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style =&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;For twenty years, most of the victims licked their wounds silently. After the news that &quot;a primary school principal raped and molested 22 girls in 9 years&quot; attracted attention, some people worried on social platforms: What will happen to the children who have been harmed? They still have a long way to go. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Sun Xuemei, the initiator of &quot;Girls Protection&quot; and deputy editor-in-chief of ifeng.com, told Southern Weekend reporters that after being sexually assaulted, children&#39;s psychology will change, even in the long term. Troubled, I hope that with the help of the local Women&#39;s Federation and other departments, the children can receive timely psychological intervention. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;She specifically reminded parents not to beat, scold or blame their children. &quot;This is not the child&#39;s fault. We need to make the child feel that the family is safe and that parents can accept talking and relying on them. If after such an incident, parents beat, scold and blame them, they will push the child into a more helpless situation. .&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The &quot;Girls Protection&quot; project team has been to many rural schools across the country to conduct sexual assault prevention courses. Sun Xuemei found that the common problem currently is the lack of sex education, and many people talk about sexual perversion. However, it can be seen from the gradually increasing reporting rate that people&#39;s awareness is improving. &quot;Only when everyone&#39;s awareness increases and they pay attention to this problem, and (the problem) is exposed more and more, will it be solved faster.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The end of Zhang Longji’s criminal behavior was due to the call to the police by the victim’s family in June 2019. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Zhou Lan recalled that at noon on the day of the incident, Zhang Longji drove away from school. Also disappearing was a female classmate from the school. &quot;After class, (I) saw that the girl was not there, so I told other teachers. I didn&#39;t know that until the next day.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;He heard from the girl’s sister that the girl tried her best to resist and was beaten with a heavy object by Zhang Longji and was seriously injured. The girl was sent to Jingning County Hospital, but her injuries were serious and she was sent to Lanzhou for medical treatment. Zhang Longji was later taken away by the police in Lanzhou. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In November 2019, 30-year-old Yu Tong met Zhang Longji in the detention center, and the two stayed in the same cell for three months. After completing his sentence in 2023, he provided his release certificate to Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In the prison cell, Zhang Longji wore a red vest, handcuffs and shackles. Yu Tong said that &quot;inmates&quot; all knew that he was suspected of rape and child molestation. During that period, Zhang Longji was often bullied by his fellow prisoners and had to be moved from one cell to another. Another &quot;inmate&quot; Zhao Wuping also confirmed that &quot;people like him are often bullied in there.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Zhao Wuping entered the detention center for drunk driving in July 2019. He was &quot;headache&quot; about his situation and did not want to chat with other people. But he remembered that Zhang Longji&#39;s condition at the time was &quot;not bad&quot; and he said, &quot;He will be released after being sentenced to more than ten years.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The seriousness of the matter obviously exceeded Zhang Longji&#39;s expectations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Pingliang Intermediate Court sentenced Zhang Longji to death for rape and deprivation of political rights for life; for child molestation, he was sentenced to ten years in prison; several crimes were punished concurrently. ,Decided to implement the death penalty, deprivation of political rights for life. Zhang Longji once appealed, but the appeal was rejected by the Gansu Provincial High Court and the original death sentence was upheld, which was approved by the Supreme People&#39;s Court. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On November 7, 2023, the Pingliang Intermediate People’s Court followed the execution order issued by the President of the Supreme People’s Court, verified Zhang Longji’s identity, and escorted him to the execution ground. Execution by lethal injection. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(Except for Zhang Longji and Sun Xuemei, pseudonyms are used in the article)&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 05 Dec 2023 22:55:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[家长罢课拒纳“问题学生”：为何开除与送专门学校不是选项？丨快评]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261927]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-12-05 22:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Recently, some parents posted online that on November 23, 2023, Changtu County, Tieling City, Liaoning Province The Experimental Primary School transferred a student from Class 11, Grade 4, to Class 8 without communicating with the parent committee. The article stated that the student threatened the entire class when handing out mid-term exam papers, hugged the teacher&#39;s lap and cried and made a fuss. He also knelt down and prayed to the teacher not to tell his parents about the test results. After being rejected, he threatened and insulted the teacher, causing the head teacher to be hospitalized due to sudden illness. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Parents protested collectively and picked up their children early to start a class strike. On November 29, the local education bureau issued a notice stating that the primary school was transferring a student to a parallel class. Parents of the students who were transferred to the class showed resistance, and many students did not attend school. They reported the matter online. Changtu County Education Bureau and Experimental Primary School... decided after research to cancel the class adjustment plan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What do you think of this incident? First, it is necessary to explore the nature of the student&#39;s problem. If what the above parents said is true, then from the fact that the student threatens the whole class, begs the teacher, and threatens and insults the teacher, it seems that the student may have behavioral problems, but the specific problem is still difficult to determine. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, it is not difficult to understand the position of the parents of Class 8: originally the class order and discipline were good, but suddenly a &quot;troublemaker&quot; and &quot;trouble maker&quot; came, making other children uneasy and affecting their learning. No one will welcome it, cause tensions, or even upset children&#39;s moods. If you can&#39;t turn them away before you come, it will be difficult to ask them to leave after they come. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Because a student in a class has behavioral problems or character problems, disrupts classroom order or bullies other students; or parents are overprotective of their children and have serious conflicts with other children and their parents. , As a result, other parents can&#39;t bear it anymore, and they &quot;go on strike&quot; in anger, go to the Education Bureau to petition, and complain online. This often happens. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2019, parents of fifth graders at Hangzhou Wenlan Experimental School published an open letter online saying that a student named W was an overprotected child by his parents. If he had any disputes with teachers or classmates at school, his parents would directly They stormed schools and classrooms, and repeatedly threatened and abused the children, parents, and even teachers in extreme ways. For this reason, parents went on strike in anger. A situation report issued by the school stated that &quot;an incident occurred in Class 505 of our school where many students asked for leave but did not come to school to study.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Secondly, the way the school and the local education bureau handle such incidents is nothing more than trying their best to mediate and persuade. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Changtu County Experimental Primary School gave up its plan to adjust classes, saying it &quot;will further optimize educational resources, rationally allocate teachers, and teach students in accordance with their aptitude.&quot; The implication is that the students with the problem will continue to remain in Class 11, but it seems that they will be replaced by teachers who are more resistant and more capable to tackle the problem. &quot;Currently, students have fully returned to school,&quot; and the problem has been temporarily resolved. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the case of the strike at Hangzhou Wenlan Experimental School, a joint special class composed of the District Education Bureau and the District Public Security Bureau was established, and then a parent interview meeting was held to &quot;carefully listen to the parents&#39; feedback and demands.&quot; “Both parties actively communicated to eliminate differences, and after discussions, a preliminary consensus was reached.” Students who asked for leave “returned to school one after another” that afternoon. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Why are similar solutions so common? This is because the current Compulsory Education Law stipulates that students who violate the school management system shall be criticized and educated by the school and shall not be expelled (Article 27). Under such constraints, if there are &quot;problem children&quot; in a class who are considered unbearable by many parents, they can only tolerate it at the beginning. If they can&#39;t bear it anymore, they will use strikes, petitions, and open letters online to try to overcome the pressure of public opinion. Let the &quot;problem children&quot; transfer to another school; if they really can&#39;t be driven away, well-connected parents will consider transferring their children to another school. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, there are many people on the Internet who say, and their voices are quite loud: Isn’t it enough to transfer “problem children” to vocational schools for correction? This simplifies the problem. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Indeed, Article 6 of the Law on the Prevention of Juvenile Delinquency stipulates: The state shall strengthen the construction of specialized schools and provide specialized education to minors with serious bad behaviors. So, what constitutes serious bad behavior? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The bad behavior defined in this law refers to &quot;behavior carried out by minors that is not conducive to their healthy growth&quot;, such as truancy and truancy for many times; associating with people with bad habits in society, organizing or Joining a gang that commits bad behavior, etc. Obviously, it is fine if bad behavior only harms oneself. The key is that many bad behaviors have negative externalities and will harm other children. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Article 31 of the Law stipulates: Schools shall strengthen management and education for underage students who have bad behaviors and shall not discriminate; for those who refuse to correct or the circumstances are serious, the school may punish them according to the circumstances or take the following measures: Management education measures: provide discipline; require compliance with specific codes of conduct; require participation in specific special education; require participation in on-campus service activities; require psychological counseling and behavioral intervention from social workers or other professionals, etc. But obviously not including expulsion. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The so-called serious bad behavior refers to &quot;behavior committed by minors that is stipulated in the criminal law and not subject to criminal punishment because they are under the legal age of criminal responsibility, as well as behavior that seriously endangers society&quot;, such as fighting in groups, chasing , intercepting others, forcibly taking or arbitrarily damaging or occupying public or private property and other provocative and troublemaking behaviors; beating, insulting, threatening, or intentionally injuring others&#39; bodies, etc. So can someone with this kind of behavior be immediately sent to a vocational school? Neither. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Article 41 of the Law stipulates: For minors who have serious bad behavior, the public security organs may take the following corrective and educational measures according to the specific circumstances: admonish them; order them to apologize and compensate for losses; order them to declare repentance. ; Ordered to regularly report on activities; ordered to abide by specific behavioral norms and not to perform specific behaviors, contact specific people, or enter specific places; ordered to receive psychological counseling and behavioral modification; ordered to participate in social service activities, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If a minor commits an act that seriously endangers society, the circumstances are egregious or causes serious consequences, or if a minor commits an act that seriously endangers society multiple times, or refuses to accept or cooperate with the corrective education measures stipulated in Article 41 above, Upon evaluation and approval by the Specialized Education Steering Committee, the education administrative department together with the public security organs may decide to send the student to a specialized school to receive specialized education. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It can be seen that students only disrupt classroom discipline and bully other students, which is not considered &quot;serious bad behavior&quot;. It is impossible to be expelled and it is impossible to go to a vocational school. However, this type of behavior is enough to cause great consequences. Externalities make other children and even teachers and parents miserable. Within the above framework, the problem is difficult to solve, and I am afraid it will still happen from time to time in the future. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 05 Dec 2023 22:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[持有不超十天、覆盖数千只股票、年换手率百倍中国量化投资的股市“淘金术”]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261894]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-12-05 21:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;In the second half of 2023, as the A-share volatility intensified, approaching 3,000 points several times, &quot;quantitative trading&quot; became The focus of controversy in China’s capital market. The market has set off rounds of discussions around whether quantitative funds are &quot;tools for cutting leeks and vampires of the stock market.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But the leading quantitative funds, which have always been low-key, continue to make news. At the end of August, according to reports from multiple media outlets including Securities Times and Brokerage China, Qiu Huiming, founder of Minghong Investment, purchased Shanghai’s “first luxury home” for 285 million yuan. At the end of October, news of an extramarital affair among the founders of another leading quantitative company, Magic Square, spread widely in the asset management circle. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A private equity firm chairman told a Southern Weekend reporter: &quot;The biggest problem with quantitative funds is that no one has publicly disclosed specific operating methods.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Mysterious quantitative investment How exactly does it work? Why does quantitative investing become the target of public criticism during a stock market downturn? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporters recently interviewed a large number of domestic quantitative investors. What&#39;s interesting is that they are eager to explain to the outside world what quantification is, but they also want to hide behind the scenes - &quot;Low-key, we must be low-key.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Simons’ followers&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In 2010, the American high-speed network provider Spread Networks spent US$300 million to build a long-distance network between Chicago and New York. The straightest optical cable of 1,330 kilometers only shortens the time for high-frequency traders to obtain information by 0.003 seconds. Michael Lewis tells this true story in his book &quot;High Frequency Traders: Wall Street&#39;s Speed ​​Game.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this year, China&#39;s CSI 300 stock index futures were officially launched, providing a hedging tool for domestic quantitative investment. Many Chinese returned to China from Wall Street to start their own businesses. 2010 is therefore recognized as the first year of quantification in China. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To date, a leading quantitative private equity fund executive has provided data to Southern Weekend reporters: Domestic funds plus overseas funds such as Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect and QFII currently account for the total turnover of quantitative transactions in the A-share market. The proportion is 25%-30%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;James Simons, the &quot;Father of Quantitative Investment&quot;, is the spiritual mentor of this group of practitioners. Most of the interviewees mentioned the book &quot;The Man Who Conquered the Market&quot;. This book records the story of how Simons successfully transformed mathematical algorithms and computer trading software into &quot;stock market gold mining&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The book mentions that the origin of quantitative investment can be traced back to the late 1980s. Before this, no one believed that computers could invest like humans, but Simons and the quantitative investors behind him firmly believed: &quot;There must be a way to model prices.&quot; They do not believe that the market is a &quot;random walk&quot; that is unpredictable. Although there is a certain degree of randomness, if a certain probability distribution is used, future price trends can be predicted. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among James Simmons’ followers, there are more Chinese than most people imagine. A high-frequency trader who returned to China in 2015 still can’t figure out why there are so many Chinese doing quantitative work in the United States. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;The Chinese account for at least one -third of the proportion. They are spreading all over the New York Stock Exchange and various institutions of Nasdaq, either IT or data models.&quot; He told the southern weekend reporter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; However, Sam, the founder of a domestic head quantified agency, believes that this is well understood, &quot;Chinese people are not outstanding in other aspects. Investment banks are also good, but do you know people?&quot; &lt;/&lt;/&lt;/&lt;/&lt;/&lt;/&lt;/&lt;/&lt;/&lt;/&lt;/&lt;/&lt;/&lt;/&lt;/&lt;/ P>; &lt;p>; After graduating from Dr. SAM, he became a high -frequency trader on Wall Street. He tried a procedural transaction in the domestic market around 2006. &quot;But at that time, the domestic market data took 15 seconds to me, and the order was 15 seconds to the exchange. &quot;. SAM told reporters from the Southern Weekend that it should not exceed 3 seconds back and forth, and delay will bring price changes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In June 2013, the new &quot;People&#39;s Republic of China Securities Investment Fund Law&quot; was officially implemented. Private equity was allowed to record and open an account. You can issue autonomous products without the need to use the securities firm channel. This year SAM returned to China. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;When returning to China, the speed can reach within 1 second, and now the Shenzhen Exchange can achieve a few milliseconds. However, in the US market, everyone is pursuing microseconds (one millisecond is equal to 1000 microseconds). &quot;He said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; At this stage, some senior people of some overseas -top quantitative institutions began to return to China to start a business, including Ren Sihong of Jinyu Assets, Wang Chen invested by Jiu Kun, Xu Xiaobo, who invested in Ruitian, Qiu Huiming invested by Mingzheng, and Yin Yin, Yin Yin, Yin Yin Xu Shunan and others of Nuo assets. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In 2014, Cai Meijie, deputy president of CICC Sales and Exchange Department, founded the establishment of Lingjun Investment; in 2015, the three Zhejiang University Computer Department, including Xu Jin, shifted from the IT field to a versatile investment, and created a fantasy party to create a fantasy party Quantify. Fantasy Fang, Ming Hong, Jiukun, and Ling are all called the &quot;Four Great Kings&quot;, and each asset management scale exceeds 60 billion yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In 2015, China ’s quantitative private equity is mainly hedge products. In the second half of 2015, the stock index futures were limited, and the overall scale of private equity in three years did not increase and fall. In 2021, quantitatively entered a period of rapid development. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;2021 is the most lively year. The industry scale is basically doubled. &quot;A quantitative practitioner told the southern weekend reporter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; At this stage, Mingzheng Investment and Fantasy Fang Investment once expanded the management scale to 100 billion yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;H4>; &lt;strong>; &quot;Where is the talent &lt;/strong>; &lt;strong>;, &lt;/strong>; &lt;strong>; Where are we&quot; &lt;/strong>; &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; , China quantitatively the &quot;Four King of Heaven&quot; fantasy, Jiu Kun, Lingjun, Minghong, etc. all have office sites. They are close to the Tsinghua Science and Technology Park, Zhongguancun Chuangye Street and other places. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; This site is selected because &quot;where is the talent and where are we.&quot; These companies have gathered high students from famous universities around the world, including Stanford, Cambridge, and MIT. On the propaganda wall of an institution, Qingbei Zhejiang University ranked the last three. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;There are many people in the head quantified company,&quot; a practitioner told a southern weekend reporter. When there was a quantitative investment institution recruited people, it proposed that &quot;the winner of the Tsinghua Yao Ban and the Olympic Medal will not take it.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In 2005, Yao Qizhi, a world -renowned computer scientist and founder of the world&#39;s modern cryptographic foundation, founded the Tsinghua Academy&#39;s computer science experimental class. This class was referred to as &quot;Yao Ban&quot;. There is a saying that &quot;China&#39;s talents in Tsinghua, Tsinghua&#39;s talents in Yao Ban&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The original intention of Yao Ban was to screen and cultivate the world&#39;s most top computer genius. A graduate of Tsinghua University described this, &quot;This is the most tip -to -pointed person in the nation&#39;s number one computer department.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Most of these young people are post -90s and men and women. They knocked on the keyboard in the office, and there were four huge computer screens on the desk. At a glance, it is a line of code data. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The division of labor in traditional subjective funds is that analysts provide information, fund managers make decisions, and traders specifically execute order transactions according to the instructions of the fund manager. &quot;The quantitative fund has no concept of trader or trader, but is called a strategic developer and quantitative engineer.&quot; Wang Xiong, the founder of Siyuan quantified, told the southern weekend reporter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The person who sets the model is the core person of the quantitative company. The model is composed of people+computing power. The development of quantitative trading strategies involves technologies such as mathematical models, statistical analysis, machine learning. Engineers will write and test code, and use historical data for recovery to evaluate the potential performance of the strategy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Therefore, their work content can be summarized as three words &quot;writing code&quot;, &quot;more like a code farmer&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In February 2023, the head quantitative company&#39;s fantasy recipe and Ruitian Investment Division, the reason is that Rui Tian Investment took away the team and joined the fantasy party. Due to the long -term high contact of the strategist personnel, the strategy personnel have been highly exposed to heights for a long time. Core business secrets in quantitative investment -quantitative trading strategy code, Ruitian Investment believes that the other party is suspected of business secrets and improper competition. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In addition to the competition of talents, quantitative funds also need to compete for computing power. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;China holding the most high -performance GPU institutions is not an artificial intelligence company, but a quantitative investment company, and the fantasy party is the first.&quot; A domestic GPU agent told Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The CPU familiar to ordinary people is responsible for reading the original data, temporarily exist in memory, and the GPU is to calculate the data of the data and the model of the training model. Brain experience. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; A person in the IT industry told the southern weekend reporter: &quot;CPUs are also dozens of physical Cores, and the GPU has tens of thousands of CUDA Core.&quot; Core can be understood as the core of the operation and use GPU to train a big one. The model is probably monthly, correspondingly. If the traditional CPU is probably annually calculated, the training efficiency is huge, and the gap between the reasoning efficiency is more than 100 times. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Nvidia A100 graphics card is a professional GPU, which is very powerful and can reach 19.5 TFLOPS (floating -point operations of 19.5 trillion times per second). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In 2019, AI company was established with a quantitative formula, equipped with 1,100 GPUs. In 2021, the Nvidia A100 graphics card owned by the magic side has reached tens of thousands. The above IT people are shocked by this number, which has broken through the reserves of some major Internet factories in China. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; SAM explanation, starting in 2016, quantitative investment is based on the low -frequency Alpha plus T+0 (within the daily circulation transaction) as the main style. After 2018, it is a full -cycle model and deep learning model. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;Assuming that if you do a deep learning model, the researchers need to keep trying to try different parameters, structures, and characteristics. A researcher can get dozens of cards. Of course They are all occupied, but it is difficult for a person to think of so many ideas at the same time. &quot;&lt;/P>; &lt;p>; For a researcher, you can configure dozens of cards. The above IT industry people think that this is bragging. He graduated from Tsinghua, and he made a model quantified in a large factory, and the configuration was one card alone. &amp; nbsp; &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>; &lt;strong>; &quot;&lt;/strong>; &lt;strong>; Covers near &lt;/strong>; &lt;strong>; 2000 &lt;/strong>; &lt;strong>; Only stocks &lt;/strong>; &lt;strong>; &lt;/strongRong >; &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; Few people know how to make money for quantitative investment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; A personal investor who purchased the fantasy -based quantitative product, he pointed at the romantic story of quantitative giants. But for quantitative investment, she admitted to the southern weekend reporter: &quot;I don&#39;t understand.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The chairman of a private equity fund with a scale of another fund management scale has invested a lot of family assets into the head quantitative company. His understanding of quantitativeization is to mass slaughter according to the behavior model of tourism and retail investors, and the quantitative self -employed strategies and transactions are preferred by asset management. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Yang Delong, chief economist of Qianhai Open Source Fund, explained to the south weekend reporter with the &quot;dog walking theory&quot;. &quot;Value investment is more concerned about the walking route of people (fundamentals), but quantification is mainly to make excess returns by discovering the movement of dogs (stock prices).&quot; Yang Delong said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Quantitative transactions, overseas called &quot;Quantitative Trading&quot; or &quot;Quantitative Investment&quot;, Quantitative (quantified) is corresponding to Discretionary. The latter refers to the judgment and understanding of one thing, the decision -making process depends on personal judgment, and has a greater degree of freedom. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;Quantitative data is based on data, with the mathematical model (statistical model) as the core, it is completely based on data. We call it quantitative and subjective investment is more qualitative.&quot; Sam To the southern weekend reporter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In his opinion, both individual investors and institutional investors, everyone has behavioral inertia, but the way of thinking may not be completely rational, and it will make mistakes in the process. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; He divides quantification into two parts. The quantitative analysis of fundamentals is very similar to the publicity of publicity, cash flow and other public data. However, in the other part, quantification will grasp the wrong transactions of the market, that is, deviate from a reasonable price transaction formulated by quantitative models. &quot;After catching the wrong transaction, we buy it as if it is lower than the reasonable price, and sell it higher than the reasonable price.&quot; &lt;/P>; &lt;p>; Taking Moutai as an example, subjective investment may judge that the stock will rise, but the quantification will clearly have a clearly one. Forecast: &quot;We will say that this stock will win 1%of the market in the next 10 days, and the error is ± 5%, which is completely a statistical concept.&quot; &lt;/P>; &lt;p>; Data -based), the company&#39;s stock price shows a certain regular distribution. This reasonable price refers to a range. &quot;A quantitative practitioner told the southern weekend reporter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Yang Delong believes that quantification and value investment are essentially different. &quot;Quantitativeness is more to make money by fluctuations in stock prices, so they are called cutting leeks. Value investment is generally held for several years. &quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Quantitative practitioners do not avoid it. Most of the domestic mainstream quantitative private equity uses statistical arbitrage as its core strategy. The prediction cycle ranges from within a few days to a few days, and generally does not exceed 10 days. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; There are no standards and characteristics of quantitative selection of stocks, and do not set up industries and fields. They do not pay attention to whether the enterprise has new products, nor does it pay attention to what the secretary said. When the stock price is calculated based on the model, it belongs to the &quot;super buy&quot;, and the quantification will directly touch the selling stocks, and there is no human emotional and subjective judgment in the middle. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; A number of head quantitative practitioners told reporters from the Southern Weekend that a mature large -scale quantitative company will scan more than 5,000 stocks on the market. Good can be done, and the mobility is not good. The difference is that they earn more and less money. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;Our bottom warehouse has now covered nearly 2,000 stocks of A shares.&quot; SAM told Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Compared with it, 50 stocks holding 50 shares are considered many. This brings a huge difference in the turnover rate. A broker person told the southern weekend reporter: &quot;The turnover rate of public funds for equity is generally 3-5 times, up to about 10 times, which is more active.&quot; &lt;/ P>; &lt;p>; Quantitative practitioners provided by reporters from the south weekend is that most of the mainstream products of the current quantitative private placement are generally 50-100 times. above. The annual exchange rate of the quantitative strategy of stock is about 100 times, which is equivalent to the average holding cycle of about 5 days. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Sam decided to return to China to start a business in 2013. One of the important reasons is that &quot;the proportion of domestic individual investors at that time could reach 90%, and the entire market was too speculative. Alpha can be 6%, but at that time the domestic market could achieve nearly 40%. &quot;&lt;/P>; &lt;p>; Alpha and Beta were the risk quantitative indicators proposed by the Nobel Prize winner William Sharp in 1964. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Quantitative company relies on thousands of Alpha to find various laws in the market. Southern Weekend reporters visited a number of domestic head quantitative companies in mid -November. In their office areas, Alpha&#39;s &quot;A&quot; was made in the most eye -catching position. Alpha and Beta are also frequent words in the mouth of practitioners. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Yang Lei is a post -90s private equity supervisor. He gave the southern weekend reporter as an example. If he was pursuing Alpha&#39;s strategy, assuming that the broader market (with Wind A full A index as an example) increased by 10%a year and a certain strategy rose 12%. ) It is 2%. If the strategy can maintain this excess level, the market fell by 10%in the second year, and the strategy will only fall 8%, or there is still a 2%excess income. The pursuit of Alpha refers to the pursuit of long -term can win the broader market. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; If it is pursuing Beta, it is a concept of multiple. For example, the market has risen by 10%this year, and a strategy has risen by 1.5*10%= 15%, but if the market fell 10%the next year, it was 10%. It will also fall 1.5*10%= 15%. It is equal to the fluctuations of the broader market. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Can you win the market for quantitative investment? According to the private equity duct network, as of the end of the third quarter of 2023, the average quantitative private equity revenue of 537 more than the performance was 3.36%, and the proportion of positive returns accounted for more than 70%. The average value of tens of billions of quantitative private equity is 5.75%, and the proportion of positive income companies accounted for over 90%. &lt;br>; &lt;br>; SAM said to the reporter of the Southern Weekend: &quot;Quantitativeness is stronger than subjective in the short -term reasonable pricing ability, but in the middle and long periods of reasonable pricing In -depth analysis, this is not currently quantified. &lt;br>; &lt;br>; Even the Renaissance Technology Corporation founded by James Simmons, after many years of high -speed growth, the three funds of their three funds also performed bleak in 2020. According to Bloomberg reports in February 2021, the Bloomberg reported that the three funds opened by the Renaissance to ordinary investors have been redeemed at least 5 billion US dollars (about 32.2 billion yuan) since December 1, 2020. &lt;/p>; &lt;H4>; &lt;strong>; Quantitative dispute &lt;/strong>; &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; On August 27, 2023, &quot;reduced sealing stamp duty, staged tightening IPO, re -financing rhythm, regulatory shares to reduce holdings Behavioral and reduced financing margin ratio &quot;, the favorable policies have been arrowed in one day. However, the next day, the A -share opening was 5%higher and fell quickly, and the closing increase was only 1%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Who is the culprit? Quantitativeization has become the target of public criticism. Many investors believe that the opening of the market has triggered a huge quantitative fund to sell, and the latter is the &quot;largest air force&quot; of market fluctuations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; A saliva battle began in the circle of friends who invest in big brothers. Investors who oppose quantitativeization have brushed the article &quot;Quantitative Fund, the main force of today&#39;s Smiling&quot; to 100,000+, and the founders of many head quantitative agencies reprinted another article- &quot;Quantitative is the Big Bya of the Big A&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; On September 1, 2023, the Securities and Futures Commission guided the Stock Exchange to introduce a series of measures to strengthen the procedural transaction supervision. Among them, &quot;transaction behaviors with a maximum application of the highest declaration reached more than 300 or more per second, or the maximum number of declarations in a single day reached more than 20,000 transactions&quot; and so on. And make additional reports of high -frequency transactions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; But a number of interviewed quantitative practitioners said: &quot;300 and 20,000 declared standards per second and the standards of 20,000 reports have little impact on quantification.&quot; The number of strokes reaches 20,000, the account is small, but it can be done very high. But if you change your hands and large scale, this number is also possible. SAM Example: For example, a public offer has a billions of accounts, and it is not high to change hands. There are only 5%unilateral one day and only 10%in bilateral. There are also more than 20,000 pens. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;If you see the transaction opportunity, 5,000 stocks have the opportunity. In theory, we can realize 5,000 orders in one second. At most 1,000, &quot;SAM told the southern weekend reporter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Quantitative practitioners have repeatedly emphasized that programmatic transactions are not only pointing out transactions. Procedural transactions refer to investment tools corresponding to &quot;manual transactions&quot;. Thousands of assets, and manual transactions cannot be done. In addition to quantitative and private equity, public offering funds and subjective investment will also use programmatic transactions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The huge fluctuations in A shares in 2015, and Ishton manipulated the futures market case. The company is illegally profitable to make more than 2 billion yuan in transaction rules such as procedural trading software, self -buying and selling, and using the ratio of margin leverage ratio. The average order speed of Ishton is one per second. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; SAM said that stock index futures are particularly suitable for high -frequency varieties. Ionton was the second level that year, and it has not changed much. But &quot;there are fewer people who speculate in futures, and they are gambling, and the mainstream is mainly based on stock quantification.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The founder of Siyuan quantitative Wang Xiong told the southern weekend reporter: &quot;As far as the quantitative stocks are concerned, A -share transactions cannot have high frequencies of so -called ultimate pursuit of speed in foreign countries.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; From the perspective of the transaction mechanism, due to the imposed stamp duty, recognized high -frequency transactions in China&#39;s stock market basically do not exist. &quot;Because you can&#39;t make money, the speed advantage of a few seconds, the money you earn can&#39;t cover the stamp duty.&quot; Sam told the southern weekend reporter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; According to him, the shortest position in China is currently 5 minutes to 20 minutes. It can not be regarded as high frequency overseas. At most, it is only within daytime transactions. At one time, it was only a few minutes slow. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Sam still remember that when he was a high -frequency trader on Wall Street, he kept changing his hands, and 10 million US dollars could build up to $ 200 million. &quot;In China, our holding positions are about 5 days. In these 5 days, we are not pursuing how to grab this list as soon as possible, but to pursue a better excess performance.&quot; &lt;/P>; &lt;p>; In addition, the matching of the exchange of the exchange The speed is not supported. &quot;As an example, you send a list in the past, and it takes 30 milliseconds to wait for the return. Everyone in the United States is pursuing 1 microsecond, so you 30 milliseconds ± 1 millisecond fluctuations. Pursuing that 1 microsecar is meaningless. . &quot;Sam told the reporter from the Southern Weekend. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; But they are actually trying to pursue speed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; A founder of a quantitative agency revealed to the reporter of the Southern Weekend that the domestic exchanges have their own server custody centers for traders who require trading speed. , Shenzhen Stock Exchange South Center Shenzhen Tong Tukai Machine Room and Shanghai Stock Exchange Golden Bridge Custody Machine Room. Only securities and futures companies can rent the custody machine room cabinets from the exchange. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; High -end programmatic trading teams usually purchase their own equipment or specify the designated hardware configuration. They are purchased by securities and futures companies. With the consent of securities and futures companies, they are placed in the rental cabinets for transactions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Around 2014, Huabao Securities launched the LTS system, which is the first speed trading counter system in the industry. Since then, many brokers have begun to &quot;fire -fighting speed transactions&quot;, and most of them are quantitative private equity customers. , But there is a threshold for the amount of funds. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;The funding threshold for the speed trading counter is not a hard rule, but we generally publicize it is the exclusive to high net worth customers. Each threshold is different, some are 1 million yuan, and some 3 million yuan.&quot; One Brokers told the southern weekend reporter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; A private equity institution practitioner said to the southern weekend reporter: &quot;Now the larger quantitative funds, high frequencies are used for self -employment, operated by self -operated funds and leverage. The performance is asset management. How many times. &quot;But the self -operated scale data cannot be queried. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_GB2312, stkaiti;&quot;>; (responding request: SAM, Yang Lei as a pseudonym) &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 05 Dec 2023 21:25:05 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
