One of the cases was: Li repeatedly threatened his wife Wang by jumping off a building and drinking pesticide in front of her at her workplace. In order to ensure personal safety, Wang applied to the court for a personal safety protection order. The court held that: Li&#39;s self-injury behavior would cause Wang to feel nervous and fearful, which was a mental violation. Wang&#39;s application met the legal conditions for a personal safety protection order. Ruling: Li is prohibited from committing domestic violence against Wang; Li is prohibited from harassing, stalking, and threatening Wang. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The typical significance of this case is expressed as: &quot;The harm of mental violence is not less than the harm of physical violence. In this case, although the respondent did not commit any acts such as beating or mutilation, the applicant The person causes physical injury, but his self-injury and self-mutilation behavior will definitely make the applicant feel nervous and fearful, causing the applicant to be mentally unstable and act according to the applicant&#39;s will. This behavior is mental violence.&quot; &quot;Clearly adopted The behavior of harming oneself in order to control the other party is also considered domestic violence.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Theoretically, this case should establish the following rules: Either one of the spouses will cry, make trouble, and hang themselves, or threaten the other party to commit suicide. Injuring yourself to require the other party to meet your specific requirements (whether the request is reasonable or not) is an act of mind control/psychological violence/domestic violence against the other party, so the other party will receive judicial relief. Of course, it is necessary to ensure that men and women enjoy equal judicial protection, that new rules apply to both men and women, and that the principles of equal rights for men and women and equal rights and responsibilities for each party are respected. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On social media, this case has received a lot of concern, discussion and questioning. It is necessary to ask questions: The man threatens the woman by jumping off a building or going to her workplace to drink pesticides. What is the content of the threat? The basic facts of the case only state that &quot;both parties often have disputes over trivial family matters.&quot; The content of the dispute and the positions of both parties are crucial to determining who is right and wrong. From the &quot;frequent disputes&quot; between the two parties to the &quot;self-injury&quot; of the man, the conflict has an escalation process. How is this escalation completed? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The title of this case is: &quot;Wang&#39;s application for a personal safety protection order case - threatening others through self-injury and self-harm is domestic violence&quot;, and the set keywords are &quot;self-injury, self-harm, mental control&quot;. The logical chain from self-injury to mental control/psychological violence/domestic violence is: one party says &quot;If you don&#39;t agree to my request and don&#39;t act according to my will, I will hurt myself&quot; + this means that the other party &quot; Produce tension and fear&quot; and cause the other party to &quot;not be free mentally.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this regard, there are two points that may deserve further discussion. First, according to this logical chain, many different types of &quot;verbal violence&quot; by one party should also be recognized as mind control/psychological violence/domestic violence, because they can also cause the other party to &quot;generate tension and fear&quot; and cause the other party to &quot; The spirit is not free.&quot; For example, one party devalues ​​the personality, dignity and achievements of the other party through habitual and persistent complaints or derogatory and insulting remarks, in order to lower the other party&#39;s self-evaluation and thereby better manipulate the other party; or one party Make ridiculous or harsh demands, make exaggerated or false accusations against the other party, force the other party to give up their rights and self-esteem, and hand over control of their property and income, in order to control the other party mentally and financially. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Back to the above case, some netizens asked: &quot;Both parties often have disputes over trivial family matters.&quot; So during the dispute, did the woman commit &quot;verbal violence&quot; or mental violence against the man? If the man unilaterally and continuously engages in mental control/psychological violence/domestic violence against the woman through self-mutilation, why not file for divorce? In current judicial practice, domestic violence is a very sufficient cause for divorce. From the above details, it is difficult to see the necessity of maintaining this marriage. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From this we might as well extend our thinking: In a relationship between lovers or husband and wife, if one party injures himself or herself, does the other party need to be held responsible for this? The answer is self-explanatory. Because self-injury persons, as persons with full capacity for civil conduct and adults of sound mind, should bear their own responsibility and bear all the consequences of their actions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2021, a court in Inner Mongolia decided a case, which caused huge controversy. The prosecutor alleged: On September 28, 2020, E Moumou drove his wife Chao Moumou to the Tongug Nur Pastoral Area of ​​Bayanhot Town to visit their daughter in a car. The two had a quarrel and dispute over whether they needed to go to the pastoral area to visit their daughter. While the vehicle was driving, Chao suddenly opened the rear door of the vehicle and jumped out of the vehicle. He died of severe brain injury after landing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Media reports are more specific: The man drove his wife to see their 3-year-old daughter. The two of them kept quarreling over the issue of &quot;eating hot pot&quot; on the way... The wife said that she just wanted to eat hot pot now and didn&#39;t want to see the children. The man insisted on seeing the child first. When the wife saw that her husband had no intention of turning the car around to take her to eat hot pot, she became angry and made an unexpected move: she opened the door and jumped out of the car while the car was still running. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the end, the court held that the man&#39;s &quot;overconfidence&quot; caused the death of one person, constituting the crime of negligent death, and sentenced the man to two years in prison and three years of probation. The problem is that the woman did not give any warning before jumping out of the car. According to the rules and legal principles established by the above-mentioned typical cases of the Supreme Court, jumping from a car is like jumping off a building or taking pesticides. It is an act of self-harm. The person should also know the consequences of his actions, and there is no reason to hold the other party responsible. Article 66 of the Road Traffic Safety Law also stipulates: Passengers... shall not act in a manner that affects the driver&#39;s safe driving. It is impossible to establish such rules and legal principles: in the relationship between husband and wife, if one party injures himself or threatens the other party to obey, if he does not die, he will exercise mental control/mental violence/domestic violence on the other party. If he dies, the reverse will happen, and the other party will be responsible. criminal responsibility. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Furthermore, the only correct rule is that adults and no one else should be held responsible for their actions. To &quot;strive to make the people feel fairness and justice in every judicial case&quot;, the rules and legal principles presented in each case in judicial practice should be reasonable, consistent and systematic, so that the people can have stable expectations and Sense of fairness and justice. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 30 Nov 2023 18:25:17 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[“并案处理”应被精细化对待丨法眼]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261628]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-30 17:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 11/30/LAZyzv4x2zmzMca5us0hEL7XM29DdGTculyOSKr5.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/30/LAZyzv4x2zmzMca5us0hEL7XM29DdGTculy OSKr5. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;260149&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In the &quot;anti-gang and evil&quot; campaign, cases often appear to be merged. The picture shows that on October 28, 2019, the public security organs of Wuhu City, Anhui Province held an exhibition of the results of the special struggle against gangs and evil. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(People&#39;s Vision/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In criminal cases, a case often goes through its own set of proceedings alone. However, under special circumstances, &quot;consolidated case processing&quot; will also occur, that is, multiple cases will be merged together for processing. According to the relevant provisions of our country, for cases in which the same person commits multiple crimes, joint crimes, or related crimes, the public security organs, people&#39;s procuratorates, and people&#39;s courts can handle the cases together. The original intention of consolidating cases is to allow judicial staff to handle cases more efficiently, and it has produced good results in practice. For example, it can better discover the truth, ensure consistency in sentencing, and generally improve the efficiency of litigation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In recent years, in anti-gang and anti-telecommunication fraud cases, there have been huge cases involving hundreds of parties and spanning several months. At this time, some merged cases have not been handled as expected. Although it produces good results, it exposes some new problems that require urgent attention. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Unrefined systems and practices&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;On the whole, my country’s handling of consolidated cases lacks clear provisions in the Criminal Procedure Law, and at the same time, the provisions on judicial interpretation are at a low level. Defects such as overly general regulations and overly general provisions make the system not only less authoritative in judicial practice, but also less operable. This will inevitably affect the rights and interests of the parties after the case is merged, the choice of procedures, and the quality and duration of case handling. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First, the rights of the parties concerned are not adequately protected. Case-handling agencies such as the police, prosecutors, and courts have greater decision-making power over whether and how to consolidate cases. Sometimes, some case-handling agencies will bring their own case-handling needs into decision-making. Whether and how cases can be consolidated often depends on whether it can make handling the case more convenient, and whether it will affect the rights of the parties is rarely considered. This results in that in practice, it is sometimes difficult for the same party in the same case to realize the rights that he should have had when the case was not consolidated. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, in some combined cases, evidence will be used universally, and some evidence that was originally used only in one case will be used in another case. Some parties often make innocent confessions in order to get rid of the accusations against themselves, but these confessions may contain information that proves the guilt of others. In the absence of consolidated cases, once the defendant obtains a not guilty verdict, he is only a witness in other people&#39;s cases. At this time, he could refuse to appear in court to accuse other defendants due to immunity from testifying by relatives or other reasons. However, when the cases are combined, he essentially has the identity of the defendant in both cases, and the evidence proving the guilt of others in the innocent confession can be used in the entire case. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The second is that the parties’ right to choose procedures is unduly affected. With the continuous development of consultative criminal justice, our country&#39;s criminal proceedings have given parties the right to make voluntary choices in some special procedures. When certain conditions are met, the parties can choose whether to apply summary procedures and expedited adjudication procedures, and can also make a judgment on whether to appeal. However, these options will be affected when cases are consolidated. According to my country&#39;s current litigation rules, the application of these two procedural diversion mechanisms must obtain the consent of all defendants. When there are differences of opinion between defendants, some defendants who wish to have a trial as soon as possible may not be able to use summary procedures or expedited adjudication procedures. Similarly, the second instance procedure in my country&#39;s criminal proceedings also stipulates that in cases of joint crime, as long as some defendants appeal, the entire case must be reviewed and handled together. A defendant who has no intention of appealing will be forced to enter the second instance procedure because other defendants file a second instance. For these defendants who had no intention of appealing, they could have obtained an effective judgment immediately after the first instance, but the mandatory second instance procedure extended the time they had to wait for the judgment. During this time, they suffer from the uncertainty of the final verdict. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Third, merging cases without an upper limit will affect the quality of case handling. In practice, sometimes large cases involving dozens or even hundreds of defendants will be consolidated. Compared with splitting into multiple cases, giant cases require coordination among more parties and take up more time in preparation and trial procedures. Case handlers have to deal with the process of determining the facts and convicting and sentencing each person being prosecuted. The balance also requires more energy than ordinary cases, and improper handling will have a negative impact on the quality of case handling and the fairness of the results. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fourth, it may delay the handling of the case. The Criminal Procedure Law does not clearly stipulate the calculation of the time limit after the merger of cases, and the judicial interpretation only provides principled provisions on the time limit for joint trials, requiring that cases that &quot;may cause excessive delay in trial&quot; should avoid joint trials. But in fact, there is no operational standard for what constitutes “excessive delay.” Some case-handling agencies are not efficient in their work and are more willing to delay the litigation time. They will use cases with long remaining periods as the basis for the deadlines of newly merged cases. This leads to the fact that when the deadline for handling previously accepted cases is approaching, some case handlers will use newly incorporated cases as a reason to extend the deadline. As a result, merging cases has become a means for some investigators to extend the time of handling cases. It is a pity that the current system for combining cases has not yet identified and standardized this. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Refined systems promote refined practices&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In order for merger processing to better fulfill its original value and intention, it needs to be improved within the existing institutional framework. We believe that the handling of combined cases should focus more on the protection of the rights of the parties. Large cases need to be split reasonably, the time limit for handling the case should be strictly limited, and the parties should be given more room for procedural choices. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First of all, we must pay attention to the protection of the rights of the parties. Our country&#39;s merger of cases is dominated by public power, and some unreasonable phenomena have appeared in the protection of the rights of the parties. In order to change this situation, efforts need to be made from two aspects. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the one hand, it is necessary to ensure that the parties concerned enjoy the same rights when the case is consolidated as when the case is not consolidated. The International Criminal Court&#39;s &quot;Rules of Procedure and Evidence&quot; stipulate that for cases tried jointly, the parties should enjoy the same rights as if they were tried separately. Inspired by this, it is necessary for our country to emphasize in the litigation rules that regardless of whether the cases are merged or not, the parties have the same rights and treatment in the litigation - the rights enjoyed by the parties in the division of cases cannot be limited because of the merger of cases. reduce. Regardless of whether cases are merged or divided, or whatever other purposes are pursued, the rights of the parties to a fair trial need to be protected. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the other hand, it is necessary to establish the parties’ right to apply and improve the parties’ right to object. In terms of the right to apply, in addition to being decided by the public authority, case consolidation can also be initiated upon application by the parties. This can allow the parties’ demands to be taken more seriously during the merger process. In terms of the right to object, we must take seriously the objections raised by the parties to the merger procedure and protect these objections from being expressed smoothly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Secondly, the parties need to be given more choices. In criminal proceedings, the lengthy proceedings themselves are a kind of torment and a kind of punishment. In order to minimize the burden of litigation, parties should be able to enjoy the same right to choose whether to merge cases or not. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First, in the pre-trial conference system, the right of the person being pursued to choose when combining cases should be emphasized. Since the actual trial has not yet entered, pre-trial conferences can effectively resolve and prevent some procedural issues. However, the relevant judicial interpretations in our country do not emphasize that &quot;whether there are objections to the merger and division of cases&quot; is something that can be discussed during the pre-trial conference stage. This situation should be added to the relevant provisions of the pre-trial conference to expressly indicate the pre-trial conference This stage allows the parties involved in the case consolidation to express their opinions on the case consolidation. If the person being pursued cannot reach an agreement between the summary procedure, the expedited procedure and the ordinary procedure, it is necessary to discuss and consider the possibility of dividing the case at the pre-trial conference stage. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The second is to explore a divisible system for the second instance of combined cases. In our country, not all criminal cases are indivisible at the second instance stage. The Supreme People&#39;s Court has stipulated in its judicial interpretation that in cases with multiple defendants, the criminal facts of some defendants are unclear, the evidence is insufficient, or there are new criminal facts that need to be prosecuted, and the relevant crimes are not related to other co-defendants. , the people&#39;s court of second instance may handle these defendants separately based on the circumstances of the case. The second-instance rules for case consolidation can refer to this provision. When special circumstances similar to this provision occur during the case-consolidation process, unrelated defendants can also be separated in the second-instance procedure to avoid &quot;partial appeal, full appeal&quot;. case review” thereby depriving the parties of their right to appeal. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Again, giant cases must be split up reasonably. When the handling costs of giant cases exceed a certain limit, it may consume too much judicial resources and have a negative impact on the fairness and efficiency of judicial decisions. To this end, two steps can be taken to promote the reasonable division of my country&#39;s giant cases from concept to technology. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The first step is to clearly establish the awareness of rational division of large cases. Article 136 of the International Criminal Court’s Rules of Procedure and Evidence stipulates that when combining cases has a greater negative impact on the fairness of the case than dividing the cases, even if they are jointly accused, they need to be tried separately. This concept of division of cases can be transplanted in our country&#39;s judicial practice. The highest judicial authority can use guiding cases or typical cases to encourage localities to conduct pilot trials of reasonable division of giant cases under the guidance of the principles of fairness, efficiency and proportionality, and gradually establish the relationship between the case-handling agencies and case-handling personnel. Awareness of reasonable division of cases. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The second step is to improve the provisions on the reasonable division of cases system in relevant judicial interpretations based on the aforementioned work. The current judicial interpretations related to case consolidation do not stipulate whether and how cases that are no longer suitable for consolidation as the litigation activities of this department advance. Once case handlers decide to combine cases, even if unreasonably large cases arise, they rarely make adjustments to the division of cases. Therefore, relevant judicial interpretations need to be supplemented, requiring the case-handling agencies to still handle separate cases as necessary after merging the cases. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Finally, the time limit for handling the combined cases must be limited. In order to prevent the &quot;borrowing period&quot; of case handling, it should be prohibited to extend the case handling period by merging cases. That is to say, merging cases will not automatically lead to the extension of the case handling period. When the case handling period is insufficient, the case handling agency should apply for a legitimate extension for approval. procedures to extend the deadline for handling the case. At the same time, it is necessary to make it clear in the case-handling responsibility system that delaying litigation in the name of merging cases is an unreasonable way of handling cases, and case-handling personnel must bear corresponding case-handling responsibilities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(The author Liu Renwen is a researcher at the Institute of Law, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, and Qin Han is a lecturer at the Law School of Zhejiang University of Technology)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 30 Nov 2023 17:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[“基辛格不会有第二个，但基辛格的担忧却会不断重复”丨智库视点]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261631]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-30 15:11:44&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;According to Xinhua News Agency and other media reports, on November 29, 2023 local time, former US Secretary of State Henry Kissing Gerard died at his home in Connecticut at the age of 100. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Just two months ago, Kissinger was still mediating the conflict between Russia and Ukraine. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On September 24, local time, according to the &quot;Ukrainian Pravda&quot; report, Ukrainian President Zelensky met with former US Secretary of State Kissinger during his visit to the United States. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Andrei Yermak, director of the Ukrainian Presidential Office, posted the above news on social media. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Kissinger visited China in July and attended the Bund Financial Summit online on September 23. Southern Weekend once published &quot;Mediating the Russia-Ukraine Conflict, Centenarian Kissinger&#39;s Achievements and Controversies | Think Tank Perspectives&quot;, and the old version is now reposted as a mark of commemoration. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Why is Kissinger still active?&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The world today is facing huge risks, unlike any risks since the Cold War. Previous risks, whether the United States sent troops to Afghanistan or Iraq, occurred between world powers and small and medium-sized countries, and the risk of escalation is unlikely. But this time, it has become a confrontation between world powers and a strategic confrontation between nuclear powers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the one hand, the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the Great Game between Russia and the West behind it have had a strong impact on the post-Cold War world order. The conflict between Russia and Ukraine marks a serious challenge to the post-Cold War world order. On the other hand, this is also the first indirect confrontation between Russia and the US and Western camps after the Cold War. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to Yermak&#39;s account, Kissinger told Zelensky during the meeting, &quot;Before this war, I opposed Ukraine joining NATO because I was worried that it would set in motion the war we are seeing now. process (the outbreak of the conflict). Now this process has reached such an extent that the idea of ​​​​keeping Ukraine neutral in this situation no longer makes sense.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is not the first time Kissinger has mentioned Ukraine joining NATO. On May 17, The Economist published an exclusive interview with Kissinger. During the interview, Kissinger stated that he supports Ukraine&#39;s membership of NATO. He also said: &quot;Ukraine should continue to be protected by Europe, rather than becoming an isolated country that protects itself on its own.&quot; Regarding Russia, Kissinger said, &quot;If I talk to (Russian President) Putin, I will tell him , Ukraine will be safer if it stays in NATO.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Regarding the Russia-Ukraine conflict, Kissinger called on all parties to sit down and carry out diplomatic negotiations. He warned that there is now a risk that the great powers&#39; military relationships dominate their geopolitical calculations. The Russia-Ukraine conflict may therefore develop into a global conflict, and diplomatic negotiations will become &quot;increasingly important.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the other hand, Sino-US relations have undergone qualitative changes since the Trump era. Conflict has begun to replace cooperation and become the key word in Sino-US relations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Therefore, the relationship between the world&#39;s major powers, represented by the relationship between China, the United States and Russia, has become very dangerous. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this context, Kissinger became increasingly worried about Sino-US relations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to a report by Xinhua News Agency on June 16, Kissinger said in an interview with the media that Sino-US relations are on &quot;a cliff&quot; and &quot;the current trajectory of the relationship must change.&quot; Later, Kissinger also said that the Cold War between China and the United States is now &quot;walking on a mountain road.&quot; Kissinger believes that China and the United States &quot;both believe that the other side poses a strategic threat. We are moving towards a confrontation between major powers.&quot; This is a process that &quot;should not continue&quot;. Once a conflict breaks out between China and the United States, it will be comparable to World War I. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Therefore, Kissinger actively mediates the conflict between Russia and Ukraine and drags his old body to visit China, which is an attempt to stabilize Sino-US relations and exert his residual energy. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Why Kissinger? &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In the United States, there are many influential strategists. There are also many people who are worried about the international situation and are trying to improve Russia-Ukraine relations and Sino-U.S. relations. But why Kissinger and not someone else? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the one hand, Kissinger has a superstitious admiration and sense of mission for the United States. As a German Jew who escaped the Nazi regime, to hold a high position in the United States is an example of an American success story. This also makes him always grateful to the United States. He once wrote: &quot;The same generosity of spirit and lack of malice can be found anywhere else.&quot; This almost sentimental gratitude and admiration for the United States made him serve the United States at all costs in diplomacy and devote himself to Maximize the national interests of the United States. For this reason, he did not hesitate to sacrifice his personal beliefs and did not care about his personal success or failure, reaching the height of &quot;living and dying for the benefit of the country, how can he avoid it for the sake of misfortunes and blessings&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the other hand, more than half of Kissinger’s diplomatic achievements are in Sino-US relations. Kissinger is an eyewitness and operator of America&#39;s transformation from decline to prosperity. If President Nixon had not accepted his suggestion, destroyed the Sino-Soviet alliance, and shifted the strategic focus of the United States from Asia to Europe, it would have been difficult for the United States to win the Cold War in this way. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When he entered American politics, the United States was experiencing its lowest point after World War II, and was experiencing triple crises of foreign strategy, economy, and society. The United States was trapped in the Vietnam War and was unable to extricate itself; it was in economic difficulties, and the U.S. dollar lost its ability and credibility to redeem gold; domestic society was in chaos. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When Kissinger left American politics, the United States had successfully transformed China from an enemy of the United States into a &quot;friendly non-ally&quot; of the United States against the Soviet Union. Although the U.S. dollar can no longer be redeemed freely with gold, it has been tied back to the oil trade, achieving an upgrade from the U.S. dollar to an international standard currency. The U.S. dollar has transformed from an intermediary in world economic and trade to a truly hegemonic currency and an international standard currency. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These all make Kissinger unique and a myth and legend in the diplomatic community. His status and influence in international politics, especially in Sino-US relations, are irreplaceable. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Symbol of the Times&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;On June 16, 2023, according to Xinhua News Agency, Kissinger said in an interview with the media that the United States is politically polarized and is currently &quot;too focused&quot; on itself. If its foreign policy fails to balance U.S. and global interests, the United States &quot;will become isolated.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The reason why Sino-US relations turned from hostility to cooperation was that both countries had to deal with the threat from the Soviet Union. However, without Kissinger&#39;s insight and courage, it would be difficult for China-US relations to quickly restart in such a bad bilateral relationship. The symbolic effect produced by this overlapping interaction between individuals and times is something that no one else can possess. Kissinger has become a symbol, a symbol of an era, and is unrepeatable. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Historically, it was a product of the times when China and the United States united to fight against the Soviet Union during difficult times. When Kissinger secretly visited China, it was the Soviet Union&#39;s rise and hardening period, and it was a difficult period for China and the United States. The handshake between China and the United States across the Pacific and across the ideological divide not only created a diplomatic legend, but also stabilized the world situation at the time and destined the outcome of the Cold War in advance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When Kissinger came to China, he saw the strategic contradictions and ideological differences between China and the Soviet Union, and wanted to contact China to jointly fight the Soviet Union. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this sense, China and the United States have become the biggest beneficiaries of the end of the Cold War. After the end of the Cold War, both China and the United States were able to get rid of security concerns, reduce security burdens, and focus on economic development. The rise of China in the world and the rise of the United States within the Western camp complement each other. It can be said that Kissinger&#39;s personal luck lies in standing at a turning point in Sino-US relations and the world structure. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On a personal level, Kissinger is often called a realist, mainly because he puts strategic thinking ahead of ideology. This distinguishes Kissinger from the current strategic researchers in the United States who are guided by ideology. However, he did not take ideological factors into consideration. In fact, he calls his foreign policy principles &quot;liberal internationalism,&quot; which is equivalent to the neoconservatism of the George W. Bush era. It is the product of combining the emphasis on values, internationalist principles, and diplomacy based on national strength. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is precisely because of this kind of liberal internationalism that he offended the two US presidents, Trump and Biden. On November 25, 2020, Trump fired Kissinger from his position as an advisor to the U.S. Defense Policy Council. However, he is also dissatisfied with Biden&#39;s withdrawal from Afghanistan, believing it to be an irresponsible act that betrays the tradition of U.S. foreign policy dating back to President Wilson. One result of expressing this rhetoric is that Biden inherits Trump&#39;s approach to Kissinger. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, there are many talents in the U.S. strategic field, and many of the younger generation of strategic people than Kissinger have also withdrawn from the stage. The young and middle-aged strategic talents in the United States are now leading the charge in the United States. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, age is a major advantage for Kissinger. Kissinger is 100 years old and has outlived all his friends and opponents. Kissinger is the only international politician in the world who is still active and influential at the age of 100. This makes Kissinger&#39;s role largely unrepeatable. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Can Kissinger be copied? &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Kissinger is a product of his times. Times cannot be repeated, and Kissinger cannot be copied. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the one hand, the shape of Sino-US relations has changed. During the Cold War, the biggest external threat to China and the United States was the Soviet Union. For the sake of their own security, China and the United States have established a quasi-alliance system across the ideological divide, which is in line with their own interests. Now, as China has unprecedentedly entered the center of the world&#39;s power stage, Sino-US relations have become the most important bilateral relationship. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the other hand, the characteristics of diplomacy have changed. The realists represented by Kissinger advocate personal factors and are superstitious about secret diplomacy. This was already outdated by the end of the Cold War. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Kissinger was obsessed with those passionate years throughout his life, and was intoxicated by the thrill and excitement of secretly boarding a plane from Pakistan to Beijing. In the post-Cold War era, especially in the era of highly transparent and open self-media, these individual heroic diplomatic behaviors are difficult to reproduce. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, Kissinger’s influence in the United States has declined much faster than in China. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the context of the new era, many Americans are also reflecting on and challenging Kissinger&#39;s past contributions and achievements. The famous international relations scholar Hans Morgenthau has long said that Kissinger, like Odysseus in Homer&#39;s epic poem, &quot;has many facades.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the United States, there are two descriptions of Kissinger: one is a liar. This person never tells the truth, always speaks ambiguous words, and almost never makes clear public comments on major events. This may be one of the secrets of his longevity in the world of international relations. Second, Kissinger is an amazing person with an excellent memory. He was an eyewitness and living dictionary of many major events. Christopher Hitchens&#39;s description of Kissinger is perhaps more accurate, calling him &quot;a stunning liar with an incredible memory.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Finally, there is something very dangerous. Compared with Kissinger, whose main achievement was during the Cold War, current American strategists basically grew up in a peaceful atmosphere. For them, peace is no longer the primary goal of international politics, but the premise or background of international politics, which does not need to be fought for or paid for. Therefore, we can see that compared with Kissinger&#39;s concerns about the prospect of conflict, many American strategists seem not to be concerned about the possibility of conflict. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Therefore, there will be no second Kissinger, but the crisis that Kissinger is worried about will continue to repeat itself. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(The author is a professor at the American Studies Center of Fudan University)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p >;</description><pubDate> Thu, 30 Nov 2023 16:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[西藏阿里全体公务人员为一女子献血？应以令人信服的证据消除特权嫌疑丨快评]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261624]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-30 14:57:06&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;A woman in Shanghai suffered severe bleeding in a car accident in Tibet. Her relatives contacted the Ngari region through the Shanghai Health Commission and mobilized all civil servants Donate blood for it? Recently, this news has attracted great attention on the Internet, and netizens have questioned whether there is a privilege issue behind it. Although the person concerned continues to deny that any relatives are public officials, many netizens do not buy it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to reports from the Beijing News and other media, a woman who calls herself Xiaoyu recently posted a short video on social media, saying that she had a serious car accident while traveling by car to the Ali area of ​​Tibet during her honeymoon. Her liver ruptured, she lost serious blood, and she was injured. Danger to life. Her husband’s aunt contacted the Ngari area of ​​Tibet through the Shanghai Municipal Health Commission and coordinated with medical experts from Shanghai to assist Tibet to treat her. She also mobilized “all public servants” in the Ngari area, including police station police, fire officers and soldiers, and army officers and soldiers, to donate blood. In the end, more than 7,000 ml of blood was used to bring her back from the brink of death. Subsequently, she was transferred to West China Hospital in Sichuan via a medical charter flight for further treatment. After her injury stabilized, she returned to Shanghai from Sichuan to continue treatment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The video quickly attracted a lot of attention. Many netizens question who the &quot;little aunt&quot; is. She can actually allow the Shanghai Municipal Health Commission to mobilize medical experts to aid Tibet, and can also mobilize all civil servants in the Ngari region to donate blood to her. Is she suspected of taking advantage of her privileges? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After arousing great public opinion, all parties involved accepted media interviews and responded, denying the existence of privileged interference. However, these responses failed to dispel public doubts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First of all, who is the &quot;little aunt&quot;. Ms. Yu’s husband, Mr. Tao, later told the media that his aunt was not a public official in Shanghai. It was after his wife’s car accident that the local authorities suggested asking the Shanghai Health Commission for help. The aunt, who was usually close to him, “find a way” to contact the Shanghai Health Commission. Committee. The Shanghai Health Commission stated that they received a letter from &quot;relevant departments&quot; at that time, requesting Tibet-aid doctors who were in Shigatse City, Tibet, to go to the hospital involved to participate in the treatment. There was no action caused by improper factors such as personal relationships. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It can be seen that this little aunt is indeed able to contact the Shanghai Health Commission and can also get the &quot;relevant departments&quot; to send letters to the Health Commission. In the eyes of ordinary people, an ordinary citizen may only be able to call the National Health Commission&#39;s hotline at most, so &quot;little aunt&quot; will inevitably raise questions. The Shanghai Health Commission needs to provide more explanations. Which department has received the letter? The department also needs to explain. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Secondly, Ms. Yu was later sent to West China Hospital in Chengdu, Sichuan for treatment on a medical charter flight. The medical charter flight was expensive. Her father said that they were an ordinary family and the charter flight cost more than 1.2 million yuan, which they borrowed from relatives, friends and leaders. But this statement is also questionable. Although the purpose of spending one million yuan to charter a flight from Tibet to a better hospital in the mainland was to save her daughter&#39;s life, it was not easy to raise such a huge sum of money in a short period of time. According to Mr. Yu, he &quot;driving at work.&quot; Such a unit and such a good leader have aroused the envy of many netizens. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, what netizens are most concerned about is whether &quot;all public servants&quot; were mobilized to donate blood for her. Mr. Tao later said that his wife had just undergone surgery and was still seriously injured. He said this to encourage his wife to have the will to survive. In fact, it was the hospital staff who posted messages in Moments and groups, hoping that well-wishers would donate blood. , I also contacted the local police station, fire department and other departments, hoping to get their help. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Alibaba government staff said that cadres and employees did donate blood to the injured woman, but it was not officially organized, but voluntarily donated blood after seeing relevant news. Ali Hospital staff also said that after the blood bank inventory ran low, the hospital asked employees and social workers for help, and family members also asked multiple local departments for help. Later, many people came to donate blood, including dozens of public officials. The aforementioned government staff also said that the medical conditions in the Ngari area are relatively backward and the blood inventory is already very tight. If someone asks for help, many cadres and employees will voluntarily donate blood. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A Shanghai tourist had a car accident in Tibet. The relevant departments in Shanghai and Ngari worked together to coordinate the treatment of Tibet experts while voluntarily donating blood to save lives. Finally, the seriously injured tourist was rescued. This should have been a touching moment. s story. However, a short video caused an uproar on the Internet questioning privileges. The reason is that the public has seen too many unfair phenomena of using power for personal gain, and has also seen too many incidents where people show off their wealth and power online and inadvertently expose corruption issues. The short video posted by Ms. Yu may also give people the feeling of showing off her &quot;little aunt&#39;s&quot; abilities (that is, showing off her family&#39;s abilities). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So, no wonder the public suspects that there is privilege here. If you want everyone to believe that this is a purely touching incident, the parties involved, especially the official agencies involved, should come up with more Compelling evidence. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.run&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. run&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 30 Nov 2023 15:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[查理·芒格逝世 “我没有什么要补充的了”]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261619]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-30 14:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 11/30/65rPbMhQMAk6Wb5LlOGb5rwNujlbtMcUqyWfR7Dm.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/30/65rPbMhQMAk6Wb5LlOGb5rwNuj lbtMcUqyWfR7Dm. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;260229&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;May 3, 2019, Burke, Omaha, Nebraska, USA Hill Hathaway CEO Buffett (left) and Vice Chairman Munger &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong >;&quot;Less crazy and stupid than most people&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;A month before his 100th birthday, Charlie Munger died in a hospital in California. Warren Buffett has lost his best friend forever, and the world has lost another humorous and unruly wise man. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Munger, 99, is a partner of Warren Buffett. He has served as Vice Chairman of Berkshire Hathaway since 1978. Over the past 40 to 50 years, the two have worked together to build Berkshire from a shaky textile manufacturing company into one of the most successful multinational conglomerates in history. The group&#39;s subsidiaries have covered many fields such as insurance, rail transportation, energy, manufacturing, retail and services, and hold shares worth more than US$318 billion, about half of which are Apple shares. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Two weeks ago, Munger was interviewed by CNBC reporter Becky Quick. Compared with the shareholders&#39; meeting half a year ago, his thinking is still sharp and he likes to use long sentences when stating his views, but his voice has become increasingly hoarse and difficult to understand. The limitations of the body cannot be overcome by the intellect. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Quick asked him what he wanted to do in particular at the moment, and got a negative answer. His hands can no longer feel the tension of the fishing line when different fish bite the hook like they did when he was young. He no longer insists on crossing &quot;catching a 200-pound tuna&quot; off his bucket list. &quot;It requires too much physical strength. Even if I have the chance now, I won&#39;t go there, I won&#39;t even chase them. Time will always make you give up.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Compared with when he was 96 years old, he We are increasingly aware of aging and weakness in our body. When asked about it by Quick, he said he no longer had a plan. He &quot;happily accepts&quot; all kinds of changes. During the interview, he was sitting in a sunny courtyard, with a row of anthuriums, also known as flower candles, placed on the lawn beside him. This kind of flower has bright color and long-lasting flowering period. From blooming to withering, it will show beige, milky white, green and yellow, each with its own characteristics. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/30/QlY37KH7E81EYH1sOkTaiqbGA2Cmb0CkWmOADdgm.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/30/QlY37KH7E81EYH1sOkTaiqbGA2Cmb0CkWmOADdgm.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;260223&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;From &quot;The Way of Munger&quot;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo provided by CITIC Publishing Group)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Buffett often jokes that in front of Munger, he is still a young man. Just a week before Munger&#39;s death, 93-year-old Buffett had just announced a donation of approximately $866 million worth of Berkshire stock to four family charities. This is the latest step in his commitment to donate more than 99% of his net wealth to charity. Since 2006, every year on the eve of Thanksgiving, the &quot;Stock God&quot; has donated to the above four family charities. In a letter to shareholders, Buffett said that he is 93 years old and feels very good about himself, but he is also fully aware that he has entered &quot;overtime.&quot; A week later, in the &quot;overtime&quot; game, his most tacit teammate bid farewell. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Munger has always believed that the important reason why he and Buffett have had outstanding careers is to stay on the scene long enough, but the prerequisite for the magic of &quot;compound interest&quot; to be cast is still &quot;more than most&quot; People are less crazy and stupid”. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Munger was born on January 1, 1924 in Omaha, Nebraska. He has loved reading since he was a child, is especially fascinated by biographies, and has a strong logical thinking ability. After graduating from Harvard Law School as a magna cum laude graduate, Munger followed in the footsteps of his grandfather and father and started his career as a lawyer in Los Angeles. Subsequently, in order to earn more income than a senior lawyer, Munger began to rely on existing client resources to carry out investments outside of his legal business and created his own investment partnership. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/30/mp7jsMBqiHAWf10KmMJXxXhIPShRxI9hoGZ1sDuV.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;959&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/30/mp7jsMBqiHAWf10KmMJXxXhIPShRxI9hoGZ1sDuV.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;260228&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On March 9, 1988, Munger was in California, USA&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1959, Munger&#39;s father passed away. When he returned to his hometown to take care of his funeral, he met 29-year-old Warren Buffett at a dinner arranged by a friend. The two, who were 6 years apart, hit it off immediately. At Buffett&#39;s suggestion, Munger began to focus on business in 1965. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The two were each other&#39;s confidants and contributed to an important turning point in each other&#39;s lives. Buffett once said that it was Munger&#39;s ideological power that expanded his horizons and allowed him to &quot;evolve from apes to humans at an extraordinary speed.&quot; Otherwise, he would be much poorer than he is now. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the beginning of his career, Buffett was a loyal follower of Benjamin Graham, known as the &quot;Father of Value Investing.&quot; Graham advocated finding company stocks that were selling for less than working capital, buying them cheap, and then selling them when the stock price rose, leaving a sufficient margin of safety. These &quot;cheap and unloved stocks&quot; he compared to &quot;cigarette butts.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/30/DgBzqofMqcGvRNWJU3WDvArA4pJap8FglGpU91EU.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;1592&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/30/DgBzqofMqcGvRNWJU3WDvArA4pJap8FglGpU91EU.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;260227&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&quot;Munger&#39;s Way&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The key force driving the evolution of Buffett&#39;s investment philosophy is Munger. Munger believes that Graham&#39;s investment strategy is based on the assumption that the future will be &quot;more dangerous than full of opportunities.&quot; But in fact, investing in great companies with fair stock prices is far better than investing in ordinary companies with ultra-low stock prices. Influenced by Munger&#39;s ideas, Buffett gradually moved away from the limitations of Graham&#39;s theory. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;They found that some stocks are still very cheap even though the price is two or three times their book value, because the company may be on a growth path, have very good managers, or The whole management system is excellent and so on. Through detailed analysis of balance sheets, social and economic trends, etc., Buffett and Munger detected high-quality stocks from the vast stock market that they regarded as &quot;compound interest machines.&quot; Holding these stocks over the long term will result in excess profit returns, and these funds will be reinvested. Buffett compared this process to &quot;snowballing&quot;. &quot;You can only roll a snowball if you find the right snow.&quot; &quot;Choose a snowy place while moving forward to let the snowball get bigger and bigger.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since From 1965 to the end of 2022, Berkshire&#39;s annual compound return was 19.8%, and its total return in 57 years reached nearly 37,900 times, far outperforming the performance of the S&amp;P 500 Index during the same period. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Without Charlie Munger’s inspiration, wisdom and involvement, Berkshire Hathaway would not be able to develop to its current position.” After Munger’s death, Buffett wrote in a statement road. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/30/O7v0oHkL2z4eLmMxBbVRqU7G2xtdZwWNS8lw4ThR.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/30/O7v0oHkL2z4eLmMxBbVRqU7G2xtdZwWNS8lw4ThR.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;260226&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On May 6, 2023, Nebraska, USA, shareholders listened to Munger (right) and Buffett via video at the Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting Deliver a speech &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;Acquiring wisdom is a moral responsibility&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4 >; &lt;p>;According to Forbes, as of November 28, 2023, Munger&#39;s net worth was approximately US$2.6 billion. However, compared to his difficult-to-replicate wealth and life, what benefits ordinary people more is Munger&#39;s thinking mode. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Buffett calls Munger &quot;the best fast thinker in the world.&quot; As a stock picker, Buffett would test his ideas through Munger&#39;s questioning. &quot;He can think from A to Z in one go, and he can see the essence of everything even before you finish speaking.&quot; Behind this insight is Munger&#39;s long-trained thinking method, which he calls &quot;multiple Thinking Model”. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Munger has spoken many times in public about the value and importance of using &quot;multiple thinking models&quot; in the business world and real life. For example, before making an investment decision, he will conduct a comprehensive analysis of the internal operating conditions of the intended company and the larger overall &quot;ecosystem&quot; in which it operates, so he can always &quot;find convincing weaknesses within 60 seconds.&quot; . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to Munger&#39;s estimate, he has as many as a hundred multiple thinking models stored in his mind. These models will help him collect and process information and provide decision-making guidance on this basis. These models need to borrow and combine analytical tools, methods and formulas from various traditional disciplines, including the redundant backup system model of engineering, the compound interest model of mathematics, the breakpoint of engineering, the overturning moment of physics and chemistry, and the autocatalytic model. Modern Darwinian integrated models in biology, and cognitive misjudgment models in psychology, to name a few. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/30/CmTkpEB3YqZ184Ju7dBlvWVXmJpC6Sg8ZqUNmcab.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;1525&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/30/CmTkpEB3YqZ184Ju7dBlvWVXmJpC6Sg8ZqUNmcab.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;260224&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&quot;Poor Charlie&#39;s Almanac&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Behind the so-called &quot;intuition&quot; is actually the end point of a long thinking journey, which is Munger&#39;s understanding of human behavior and business systems. and other products of long-term interdisciplinary research. He advocated &quot;quick annihilation of what shouldn&#39;t be done, followed by a skilled, interdisciplinary attack on what should be done, and then, when the right opportunity comes - and only when the right opportunity comes - decisive action.&quot; He likes to regard his life as an educational experiment. &quot;A person who has mastered his major well will test the feasibility and effectiveness of this basic academic spirit and method in a very broad academic field.&quot;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Munger&#39;s view, gaining wisdom is not just to make an individual&#39;s life better, but also a moral responsibility. He made this point in his 2007 commencement address at the USC Gould School of Law. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In his speech, he also reminded the young graduates to &quot;avoid extremely strong ideologies&quot;, &quot;especially those expressed in a very violent way&quot; because &quot;it only &quot;Instilling some concepts in people instead of convincing people to accept some truths&quot;, &quot;This is tantamount to locking the brain in a very unfortunate mode&quot;, &quot;In this way, your mind will be broken, and sometimes it will be bad.&quot; It breaks at an alarming rate.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to help himself stay clear when he is inclined to support a strong ideology, Munger set an &quot;iron rule&quot; - &quot;Only if you can be better than your opponent I am qualified to have an opinion only when it refutes my own position.&quot; Of course, this &quot;iron rule&quot; is not limited to avoiding the whirlpool of strong ideologies. Munger believes that this way of thinking deserves continuous training. Only by constantly falsifying and questioning yourself can you reduce your ignorance. In his opinion, perhaps more suitable as an ideology is the spirit of &quot;accuracy, diligence and objectivity&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In contrast, catastrophic thought states include &quot;jealousy, resentment, hatred, and self-pity.&quot; Munger has experienced the greatest pain in the world. In 1953, shortly after divorcing his wife, his eldest son Teddy suffered from fatal leukemia. Bone marrow transplant surgery had not yet been available at that time, and Teddy soon died of the terminal illness. In the memories of friends, after visiting his son in the hospital at that time, the 29-year-old Munger would often walk on the street crying. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many years later, Munger warned young people, &quot;Excessive self-pity can make people almost paranoid. Paranoia is one of the hardest things to reverse. Whenever you find yourself feeling self-pity, whether it is No matter what the reason, even if your child is about to die from cancer, you have to think that self-pity will not help.&quot; However, different life stages will always encounter very difficult problems. His advice is: Don’t have high expectations; have a sense of humor; surround yourself with the love of friends and family. &quot;The most important thing is to adapt to changes in life.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As a wealthy and long-lived wise man, Munger is most often asked &quot;How to become happy and wealthy?&quot; In his opinion Come on, there&#39;s more to life than just being smart about accumulating wealth. Most success in life and business comes from things that should be avoided, like premature death and bad marriages. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/30/qxt9znRMzJc1X9gzp3gXf67kE7UzJkseFJjzmsKJ.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;639&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/30/qxt9znRMzJc1X9gzp3gXf67kE7UzJkseFJjzmsKJ.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;260225&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On September 29, 2010, Munger (left), Buffett (middle) and Bill Gates attended an event in Beijing&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>; (Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He has another answer - &quot;When you get up every day, strive to become a little smarter than you were before. Complete your tasks seriously and well. Slowly, you will make progress, but not necessarily quickly. But it will lay the foundation for rapid progress...slowly moving forward a little bit every day. In the end - if you live long enough - you will get better. Most people will get what they deserve.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the age of 82, Munger&#39;s friends gave him a copy of &quot;Cicero on the Good Life&quot; published by Benjamin Franklin, which included a A translation of Cicero&#39;s &quot;On Old Age&quot;. Inspired by this article, Munger wrote the article &quot;In Praise of the Elders: Munger on Old Age.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the article, Munger excerpted a summary of this wise man who was born in 106 BC: &quot;The best protective armor in old age is a life that has been carefully spent before it, and a life that has been used for... A life of useful knowledge, honorable deeds, and noble conduct; the man who leads it devotes himself from youth to his own improvement, and will reap in old age the happiest fruits that they produce; and not only because Beneficial knowledge, glorious achievements and noble deeds will accompany him throughout his life, even to the last moment of his life, and will bring supreme blessings to the soul because of the conscience that has witnessed an upright life and the memory of the good achievements in the past.

Thousands of thousands of down jackets are frequently on the hot search list, slowly becoming a &quot;luxury product&quot; in winter &quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Not long ago, the &quot;3 yuan down jacket&quot; attracted the attention and discussion of netizens, showing that low-priced down jackets costing 3 yuan but actually selling for only 35 yuan were given to ordinary people in the cold winter. The warmest gift, for them, is more than enough for them compared to big-name luxury goods. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As the light snow season has arrived and major cities have entered winter, many people have dug out the down jacket that has been at the bottom of their boxes for a year. Statistics show that more than half of netizens buy down jackets when needed. , during the Double 11 period, down jackets became a hot-selling product on major e-commerce platforms. Many domestic down jackets appeared on Tmall’s best-selling list and received a lot of praise. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, the rise of domestic down jackets is inseparable from the improvement of the comprehensive production strength of the manufacturers behind them, and the Yangtze River Delta is the main force in down production. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shandong, the number of down-related companies exceeds 10,000, and many domestic down jacket brands are gradually starting to transform. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Faced with the wide variety of down jacket brands and types, many netizens said that they are in urgent need of a scientific selection guide. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First of all, it depends on the filling of the down jacket: goose down is more expensive than duck down due to factors such as large and full velvet, good fluffiness, strong warmth retention, and long use time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Secondly, it is the down that really plays a role in keeping warm, and the down content more intuitively reflects the quality of the down jacket. It is worth noting that thicker and warmer is not the case. The higher the fill power of a down jacket, the more air it insulates and the better its thermal insulation effect. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From the data point of view, there are still a small number of netizens who choose thousand-yuan down jackets, and most netizens pursue cost-effectiveness. As a saying often seen on the Internet: It’s not that down jackets are unaffordable, but that cold medicine is more cost-effective. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What price range of down jacket would you choose? Today, &quot;Know&quot; will show you how to choose a cost-effective down jacket. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/28/586c1b2150.PNG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;1440&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/28/586c1b2150.PNG&quot; data-key=&quot;259897&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p >;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/28/135e6eaeff.PNG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;1440 &quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/28/135e6eaeff.PNG&quot; data-key=&quot;259898&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot; http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/30/tytIIT1Ze3ZYW31QaU8DrhSJeQ8Tm4SvtKxe7GWc.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;900&quot; height=&quot;1200&quot; data-src=&quot;//images. infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/30/tytIIT1Ze3ZYW31QaU8DrhSJeQ8Tm4SvtKxe7GWc.png&quot; data-key=&quot;260222&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images. infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/28/a2e0996720.PNG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;1440&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/ medias/image/23/11/28/a2e0996720.PNG&quot; data-key=&quot;259899&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/ medias/image/23/11/28/f6fba97f3a.PNG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;1440&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 11/28/f6fba97f3a.PNG&quot; data-key=&quot;259900&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 11/28/9a1cf85f82.PNG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;1440&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/28/9a1cf85f82.

But in more than ten years of study experience, he found that his ideal is still to &quot;engage in academics and do research.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;After graduating from the Journalism Department of Fudan University in 1968, the child soldiers were assigned to participate in labor training in Horqin, Inner Mongolia. In 1970, the &quot;Jintie News&quot; accidentally discovered their writing skills to become a journalist. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The tide of the times is carrying budding journalism students drifting in unknown directions. In 1977, news came that the country had resumed the college entrance examination. The child soldiers who were far away from the border regained their fighting spirit to study, and the following year they were admitted to the postgraduate degree in the Chinese Department of Peking University. This year, a full ten years have passed since the child soldier graduated from college. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;His mentor during his master&#39;s and doctoral studies was journalism educator Gan Xifen. Following in the footsteps of his mentor, Tong Bing devoted himself to the research of Marxist journalism concepts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Opening up a new research direction requires a lot of basic reading support. Within one year, Tong Bing read through more than 4,000 papers with the word &quot;horse&quot; in them, and also read through all 50 volumes of the complete works of Marx and Engels. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;The complete works of Marx and Engels were published in batches. After the first 39 volumes were read, the last 11 volumes were not published until 1985.&quot; Tong Bing said that at that time, the most complete new books could only be seen at the former Central Compilation and Translation Bureau. The child soldier who was still a &quot;poor student&quot; often brought two steamed buns and a cup of boiling water to read in the Translation and Compilation Bureau, sitting there all day long. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;After graduating with his doctorate in 1988, Tong Bing stayed at Renmin University of China to take up a teaching position. In more than 40 years of research and teaching career, he has published more than 700 academic papers, published and edited more than 50 books, textbooks, dictionaries, etc., and successively published the &quot;History of Marxist Journalism Thought&quot; and &quot;The History of Marxist Journalism Thought&quot;. Academic monographs such as &quot;Classic Course of Marxist Journalism&quot;, &quot;Introduction to Theoretical Journalism and Communication&quot;, &quot;Journalism Theory&quot;, &quot;Comparative Journalism and Communication&quot;, &quot;Subject and Mouthpiece - An Examination of the Trajectory of News Communication in the Republic&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;This is how I have been through these years. It can be said that there is no time to breathe and no chance to sleep peacefully. I am constantly breaking through new tasks. Although it was tiring at the time, looking back now, I think it was worth it,&quot; he said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;As the first doctorate in journalism independently trained in China, Tong Bing has experienced the process of graduate education in journalism from scratch and witnessed the development of Renmin University of China, The development of journalism at Fudan University, one of the two famous universities in the north and the other in the south. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Do knowledge simply and plainly, but don&#39;t do simple learning&quot; and &quot;Don&#39;t dare to waste a day in life&quot; are the creeds he mentioned many times. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Already octogenarian, Tong Bing is currently a senior professor of liberal arts at Fudan University, still standing on the three-foot podium teaching journalism. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Truth&quot; is a key word for Tong Bing&#39;s academic studies. He once used the four &quot;truths&quot; of &quot;true learning, true understanding, true belief, and true application&quot; The words summarized his lifelong academic insights. His pursuit of truth in learning also allowed him to repeatedly speak out about the shortcomings of the journalism community and the industry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Journalism research has entered a new era. He directly stated the shortcomings of the development of the discipline, &quot;Among various disciplines, the discipline construction of journalism has developed slowly.&quot; In his It seems that in order to solve the development problems of journalism, &quot;it is necessary to calmly spread out the problems and conduct in-depth analysis. This may be good.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;My ideal is not here. Place&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #c00000;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>; When taking the college entrance examination in 1963 , why did you apply for the Journalism Department of Fudan University? &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Tong Bing:&lt;/strong>; I wanted to be a reporter when I was in middle school. At that time, I was a student cadre and the president of the student union. I was no stranger to news. . Student cadres who want to take the liberal arts major usually choose the Department of Politics, the Department of International Politics, and the Department of Journalism. At that time, the universities with the best journalism departments in my country were Renmin University in the north and Fudan University in the south. My parents didn’t want me to leave Shanghai, so I took the Fudan exam. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #c00000;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend&lt;/strong>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong>;：&lt;/strong>;&lt;/ span>;It took ten years between graduating from undergraduate degree and applying for graduate school. Can you talk about this experience? &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Tong Bing:&lt;/strong>; When I graduated from my undergraduate degree, it was at the end of the &quot;Cultural Revolution&quot; and I was assigned to participate in labor training in the Northeast. I started out as a road maintenance worker building railroads. At that time, all major railway bureaus in our country had enterprise newspapers, and Jinzhou Railway had an enterprise newspaper called &quot;Jintie News&quot;. More than half a year later, they found out about me and transferred me to the newspaper as an editor and reporter. The newspaper office often holds correspondent training classes. Since I major in journalism, I often give lectures and have a relatively harmonious relationship with everyone. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;After staying there for a while, our country resumed the college entrance examination. At first, the railway didn’t want to let me go because I had already graduated from my undergraduate degree. But later, the Jinzhou Railway Bureau heard that both Renmin University and Fudan University were recruiting master&#39;s degree students (there were no graduate students in the journalism major before) and agreed that I would try to take the exam. I passed the exam right away and was the first batch of master&#39;s students recruited in our country. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #c00000;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;Reform and opening up on your personal destiny What is the impact? &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Tong Bing:&lt;/strong>; The changes in my personal destiny are closely linked to reform and opening up. Sometimes I often say in meetings or classes that I am very grateful to Deng Xiaoping. If the college entrance examination and university admissions are not resumed, I may still be a reporter at the Jinzhou Railway Bureau tabloid for the rest of my life. If I do well, I may be promoted to deputy editor-in-chief or editor-in-chief. However, my ideal is not in this place. I still want to engage in academics and theory. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #c00000;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>; During graduate school, Professor Gan was How did that guide you? &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Tong Bing:&lt;/strong>; Mr. Gan Xifen is also recruiting graduate students for the first time, and his requirements for me are relatively strict. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;There were pilot projects before the &quot;Cultural Revolution&quot;, but they could not be carried out after a while, so there was no master&#39;s degree in journalism before 1978. The lifelong wish of these old gentlemen is to push forward journalism research. The National People&#39;s Congress and Fudan University were the first to do relevant work. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Mr. Gan Xifen emphasized two points when guiding me. The first point is to read the original works. He believes that graduate students in journalism should learn more classic works; the second point is to practice. I always insisted on these two points while studying at Renmin University, and I persisted relatively well. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #c00000;&quot;>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/span>;&lt;/strong>;How do you insist on these two points? required? What are the specific methods? &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Tong Bing:&lt;/strong>; I had classes during the day, read in the afternoon, and went to the journalism department office around 4 o&#39;clock to read the day&#39;s newspapers. , we poor students could not afford to subscribe to newspapers at that time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;When I come back from the classroom and library at 9pm, I review the day&#39;s newspapers in the dormitory, including the day&#39;s &quot;People&#39;s Daily&quot; and &quot;China Youth Daily&quot;. The review is conducted 5 nights a week, each person is responsible for one week, and several people take turns. The students responsible for reviewing the newspaper should take notes and write a report every week, which should be sent to the newspaper. The newspaper also attaches great importance to our opinions and will reply to us every once in a while. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;This arrangement is very helpful to our study. After a 3-year master&#39;s degree, I stuck to this method for almost 3 years. We also have many contacts with news organizations and have a relatively close relationship. I did the same thing until I stayed in school to become a teacher after graduation. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Continuously opening new courses and recruiting new students&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #c00000;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt; /strong>;&lt;/span>;&lt;strong>;1&lt;/strong>;In 1983, the Academic Degrees Committee of the State Council agreed to establish a doctorate in journalism. Under the background of that time, if you graduate with a master&#39;s degree and work as a university teacher, your academic qualifications are enough. Why do you continue to study for a doctorate? &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #c00000;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Child Soldier:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;One is because of the need for theoretical study , studying for a doctoral degree will give you the opportunity to audit courses in many other majors at Renmin University. For example, I have listened to history, scientific socialism, and international politics. When I went to attend classes, none of the teachers refused. They saw that I was not too young and still eager to learn, so they generally allowed me to enter their classrooms, and I often asked questions in class. In this regard, they really treated me. Very considerate: When I go to ask questions after class, other teachers or classmates will stop and let me (ask questions first). In the process of my study, it can be said that many teachers from relevant majors at Renmin University have helped me a lot. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In addition, my supervisor and other teachers in the journalism department hope that I can take the lead in helping the school establish a doctoral program in journalism. Later, the State Education Commission agreed that journalism would have a doctoral degree. At that time, China began to have doctoral programs (in journalism), and two schools were approved, one was the Journalism Department of Fudan University, and the other was the Journalism Department of Renmin University of China. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #c00000;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;After graduating from the Ph.D., you stayed He taught at the National People&#39;s Congress and returned to his alma mater, Fudan University, in 2001. What did you think at that time? &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Tong Bing:&lt;/strong>;After completing my master&#39;s degree at Renmin University, I stayed in school because of the needs of school work. At that time, our journalism industry was in great need of talents, and young people wanted to join it and go out into the society. But the instructor said something to me, which moved me very much. The Cultural Revolution delayed it for ten years, and they really wanted to restore our major as soon as possible, so they hoped that I could stay and teach in this school with peace of mind. Only by staying in this profession and being a good teacher can this profession continue to have new talents and new developments. I quickly accepted the arrangements in the school and worked hard. I have done a lot of pioneering work over the past few decades. It is very worthwhile when I think about it now. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Moving from the National People&#39;s Congress to teaching at Fudan is also an adjustment arrangement for the school. At that time, Fudan was in great need of people. Compared with Renmin University, Fudan&#39;s development is more international. Many outstanding students have gone abroad after graduation. The teachers are getting older and their health is getting worse every year. We teachers and students know each other very well, and we see this situation with our eyes and are anxious in our hearts. Therefore, the school raised this expectation and hoped that we can come back to shoulder the heavy burden. I came back without saying anything. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;At the beginning, there was a lot of pressure and a heavy burden. Journalism was delayed for many years by the &quot;Cultural Revolution&quot; and is in urgent need of development. The desire for talents is everywhere. So whether I stayed at the National People&#39;s Congress or was later called by Fudan University, I just taught with peace of mind, constantly opening new courses and recruiting new students. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;This has been the case for these years. It can be said that when there is no time to breathe, there is no chance to sleep peacefully. Although we were very tired at the time, we soon overcame these difficulties and continued to make new progress in our work. Looking back now, I still think it was worth it. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“Understand your mission”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #c00000;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt; /strong>;&lt;/span>;In your opinion, what is the overall shift in current journalism research and what are its deficiencies? &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Tong Bing: &lt;/strong>;Differences in theoretical viewpoints are inevitable, natural, and reasonable. (The development of journalism research) I think it ultimately depends on the progress of journalism practice. You are right to insist on your point of view. As a result, newspapers and radio and television have been successfully run. This shows that theory guides practice. On the other hand, if your theory is sound and sound, but no one reads your newspaper or listens to your broadcast, it shows that your theory has no power. Isn&#39;t this a problem? This is where we theorists feel ashamed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In addition, there is still a strong culture of self-appreciation in the academic world, which should not be the case. The academic community should review this and analyze the reasons behind it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #c00000;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;Journalism has always faced the &quot;news What do you think of the questioning and debate about &quot;no learning&quot;? &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Tongbing:&lt;/strong>; The &quot;no-learning theory&quot; has long-term influence on the development of journalism, mainly due to several circumstances. Journalism started relatively late, and there are not many independent scholarships and works. The aspect of journalism that has a deeper impact on China is practice. Running newspapers, radio stations, and television stations are all based on practical work. There are not many people who actually engage in theoretical research. Not big either. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;These understandings affect the status and image of journalism in various liberal arts majors. After we got PhDs, China&#39;s journalism research gradually got on the right track and started to have something decent. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #c00000;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;How do you understand journalists Mission? &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Child Soldier:&lt;/strong>; Journalists must understand their mission. The simplest and simplest requirement is to report the truth to the people. , real news, that’s the most important thing. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #c00000;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;Journalism Freshman Can you give some life advice to college students who have just entered school? &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Tong Bing:&lt;/strong>; This is a very broad proposition. I think the life development of college students is the same as the operation characteristics of our entire country. , one wave after another, one tide after another. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;As teachers, we hope that the new students can inherit the good traditions of the school and develop them stronger, so that the university will become better and better, and the college students themselves will also become better and better. We can continue to make progress. Only in this way will our country become better and better and our career become more and more brilliant. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;So after college students enter university, the first thing is to understand their mission. Everyone should have their own arrangements and expectations. This is not just lip service, it is actually something that must be done. We all came slowly from undergraduate to master&#39;s and doctoral degrees. New students especially need to have a sense of mission and have expectations, prospects, and arrangements for the future. I think this is the most important thing. Time flies so fast. Even if you look at the four years of undergraduate studies, half of it has passed in the blink of an eye. However, the task is actually endless. We still need to continue to work hard, strive for, and develop in the future. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;College students should not be afraid of being tired. Only by constantly exploring their own prospects can individuals have new goals, new directions, and continuous progress. Learn more every day, overcome your shortcomings, and show new expectations. This is my common expectation for our college students, whether they are undergraduates, masters, or doctoral students. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 30 Nov 2023 10:25:06 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[“机场判官”再曝住宿骗局：虚假定位误导消费者]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261538]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-30 09:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;July 5, 2020, Xi&#39;an Xianyang International Airport.

With the update of this series of videos, the Xi&#39;an transfer strategy that Liu Yi originally wanted to do has gradually evolved into a &quot;spy war drama&quot;. Netizens not only liked and followed it, but also continued to provide clues to Liu Yi. In Liu Yi&#39;s account (the account name is &quot;This is not too much&quot;), videos related to Xi&#39;an Airport have become &quot;top-rated&quot; content, and many of them have more than three million views. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On the evening of November 20, Liu Yi once again released a video saying that hotels and B&amp;Bs around Xi&#39;an Airport posted false positioning on the OTA platform (online travel hotel platform) For hotel information, he searched these platforms for a B&amp;B several hundred meters away from the airport, and actually had to take a car there.

In the video released on November 20, Liu Yi deliberately took the high-speed train from Beijing to Xi&#39;an in order to avoid leaking his itinerary, and then took a bus to Xi&#39;an Xianyang International Airport to &quot;patrol&quot;, which confirmed that the positioning of B&amp;Bs around the airport on the OTA platform was fraudulent. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In this video, Liu Yi searched for the hotel with the closest straight line distance on a platform, and the first-ranked &quot;Jiaxuan Boutique B&amp;B&quot; was marked &quot;from Xianyang The international airport is 340 meters straight.&quot; In fact, the passenger arrived at the online car-hailing parking lot, which is the hotel pick-up location. Then he searched on another platform, and multiple Huangzhixiang Hotel branches appeared on the page, one of which was &quot;119 meters &quot;Straight-line distance from Xi&#39;an Xianyang International Airport&quot;, but when I called, the other party told me that the hotel is behind the terminal and that I need to wait for the car to pick me up; finally, the Shitouji Inn, which was &quot;less than 100 meters away from you in a straight line&quot; on the third platform, was also falsely positioned. .

It is said to be an inn, but it is actually a room owned by farmers near the airport, and the sanitary rooms are extremely poor.&quot; Some netizens said that there are already tourists on the online platform Comments mentioned issues such as long distances and fake room pictures, but this type of B&amp;B still ranks high on the platform. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Liu Yi discovered that the above-mentioned B&amp;Bs were falsely positioned at the online car-hailing parking lot, T3 terminal, and T2 terminal of Xi&#39;an Airport. According to the information he collected, these B&amp;Bs are basically run by villagers from Bianfang Village and Shitou Village near the airport. Because they are close to the airport, these villages have developed a transit accommodation industry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On November 22, Southern Weekend reporters searched on Ctrip, Tongcheng, Fliggy and other platforms, and only &quot;near Xi&#39;an Xianyang International&quot; was displayed in the hotel list.

On another OTA platform, a store that was marked on the 20th as &quot;less than 100 meters away from Xi&#39;an Xianyang International Airport in a straight line, about a 1-minute walk&quot; was modified on the 22nd to &quot;4.5 kilometers from Xi&#39;an Xianyang International Airport by car, about 9 minutes.&quot; When a reporter from Southern Weekend asked why it was only a one-minute walk away, the store owner did not reply directly, but emphasized that &quot;I am outside the airport, and there is no way it is as cheap as ours inside the airport.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On November 22, Southern Weekend reporters contacted four OTA platforms, Ctrip, Tongcheng, Fliggy and Meituan, but received no reply. An industry insider on the OTA platform who did not want to be named analyzed that the platform needs to verify the address of the hotel before it goes online, and also conducts daily verification and inspections after going online. The current listings with false addresses should be due to the operators providing fake business operations. For example, the address on the license or lease contract is the same as the online address, so it is difficult for the platform to identify it. At the same time, various online travel and hotel platforms still have some agent listings, and some listings are closed on one platform and re-listed on other platforms. &quot;If the platform does not effectively intercept, it will be difficult to investigate and deal with it.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The person in charge of the above-mentioned Airport New City told Southern Weekend reporters that the local market supervision department has interviewed three OTA platforms in the past two days and ordered them to strengthen the management of homestays around the airport.

Offline, the joint law enforcement team they formed also conducted focused investigations on several issues mentioned by the blogger, including whether the names on the special industry license, business license, and door plaque were consistent, and whether the pictures on the platform were consistent with the actual situation. etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The Dilemma of Passengers’ Rights Protection&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;A few days after Liu Yi released the video, netizens left messages one after another, talking about their travels in Xiamen, Kunming, Dali, Airports in Shanghai and other places have also encountered similar problems, but not many people choose to be tough. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Netizen Zhang Ning landed at Fuzhou Airport on September 4. At that time, he chose a platform to introduce a hotel only 200 meters away from the airport. The picture looked clean and spacious. The result The man who picked her up drove her for more than ten minutes and took her to a self-built building, saying that this was a hotel. Zhang Ning reasoned with the hotel receptionist about why the hotel location and photos were different from those on the platform. The other party said, &quot;That&#39;s an old hotel and it&#39;s closed.&quot; He didn&#39;t provide a specific address and asked her to get there and take a taxi. It was already late at night, so Zhang Ning could only stay after repeated considerations, and asked the airport pick-up staff to take her back to the airport the next day. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Originally I wanted to give a negative review, but because he has my personal information, I didn&#39;t dare to give it.&quot; Zhang Ning said that she was worried about being retaliated against, and she didn&#39;t want to give it to herself. create unnecessary trouble during the journey. A few months after the incident, Zhang Ning recorded the incident in Liu Yi&#39;s video comment area, &quot;I hope more people will see these issues and support him in safeguarding his rights.&quot; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In the video recorded by Liu Yi, his process of exposing the accommodation scam was also quite tortuous.

Unexpectedly, the &quot;scammer&quot; directly solicited customers at the airport gate, posing as a hotel staff with free transit accommodation, and wanted to take him to a paid hotel. Liu Yi simply recorded the video and exposed it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;Previously, Liu Yi reported that Xi&#39;an Airport&#39;s transit accommodation was being solicited by &quot;Li Gui&quot;, and the airport promised to continue to improve the passenger experience.

Visual China Map&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On September 20, the Shaanxi Airport Public Security Bureau stated that it had stepped up inspection and control efforts and severely cracked down on illegal activities such as pretending to be staff to solicit passengers for transportation and accommodation. For disorderly conduct, 148 people have been punished since September and 3 people were detained administratively. But soon, when Liu Yi arrived at Xi&#39;an Airport again, the scammer only moved from Gate 324 to Gate 322 of the airport, and the security guards did not effectively intercept him. During this period, Liu Yi began to receive various complaints and threats in private messages. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;When Liu Yi landed at Xi&#39;an Airport for the third time, the security guard&#39;s attention became Liu Yi himself. Liu Yi mentioned that the security guard went to him when he passed by. The intercom shouted &quot;He&#39;s passed.&quot; During that trip, some netizens informed Liu Yi that her trip information had been leaked. According to screenshots provided by netizens, Liu Yi checked in at Shenzhen to fly to Xi&#39;an on October 24. At 18:42, a message appeared in the black car group at Xi&#39;an Airport that Liu Yi was about to go to Xi&#39;an, reminding everyone to be careful. For this reason, Liu Yi had to call the police. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In the following video, he said that he would buy 15 air tickets, fly from Shenzhen to Xi&#39;an once a week, and inspect the airport for improvements. He believes that compared to ordinary passengers, as a flight blogger, he can enjoy free tickets and discounts from many airlines, which provides a basis for rights protection. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;But Liu Yi said that the follow-up handling of his personal information leakage case was not satisfactory. The police found the security guard who spread the information, but were unable to find out who leaked it. He also understands this. The chain involved in the leakage of passengers&#39; personal information is too long and difficult to trace. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Southern Weekend reporters contacted the Airport Public Security Bureau of the Shaanxi Provincial Public Security Department several times but failed to get through. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Liu Yi&#39;s courage to defend his rights has aroused the sympathy of many fans. Liu Yi said that the content he received most in the backend was from netizens from all over the world asking for help, including those whose mobile phones were stolen at the airport, those who were deceived into staying in hotels, etc. &quot;Most of them I can only comfort.&quot; The communication between Liu Yi and the relevant departments of the airport has always been &quot;dialogue over the air.&quot; Liu Yi said that the airport management department contacted him after posting the relevant video for the second time and expressed the hope that he could come to Xi&#39;an to communicate in person. Liu Yi felt that it was inappropriate. Conveniently, I declined. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The person in charge of the above-mentioned Airport New City Management Committee stated that Xi&#39;an Xianyang International Airport, Xixian New District Airport New City, and the Airport Public Security Bureau of the Shaanxi Provincial Public Security Department have launched a A comprehensive management office was set up in Japan to rectify the behavior of soliciting passengers in the airport terminal. At present, this problem has been basically solved. They got in further contact with Liu Yi on November 23 and will continue to make improvements based on the issues he reported. &quot;Having such enthusiastic bloggers point out some problems in development to us, and if we correct them, I think it will also help progress.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;2023 November On March 24, Liu Yi once again updated the Xi&#39;an Airport series of videos. He asked fans to experience the B&amp;Bs around Xi&#39;an Airport, pointing out that these B&amp;Bs still have problems such as photos that are different from the actual situation and store signs that are inconsistent. &quot;Next, I want to see how this rectification (referring to the joint rectification action by the local regulatory authorities on the 23rd) will be.&quot; It won’t bring good results.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(Liu Yi and Zhang Ning are pseudonyms in the article)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 30 Nov 2023 09:25:04 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
