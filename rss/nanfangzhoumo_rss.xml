A blogger released a video saying that 12 songs from Mayday&#39;s Shanghai concert were identified, and 5 of them were lip-syncing. At present, the Cultural Market Inspection Department has launched an investigation, which will scientifically evaluate and analyze the original video and audio of the &quot;Mayday&quot; Shanghai concert, and publish the investigation results. In recent years, lip-syncing has frequently appeared in concerts and commercial performances, causing public anger and dissatisfaction.</description><pubDate> Tue, 05 Dec 2023 23:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[校长9年性侵22名女童，乡村小学里的罪恶为何难以发现]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261936]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-12-05 22:30:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img img-id=&quot;73945&quot; group-id=&quot;0&quot; asset-id=&quot;70736&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/05/7a0ad81139.jpeg&quot; img-title=&quot;WechatIMG3263.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;November 2023, Pingliang City, Gansu Province Jingning County, the village where the primary school where the incident occurred.

Photo by Southern Weekend reporter Gao Yichen&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The car stopped at the location where the name of the village was marked on the electronic map, with mountains on one side and cliffs on the other. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The driver carefully turned around, turned in through the overlooked gap, and drove through three turns on the newly found path and around two mountains. The ravine between them reaches the other side of the mountain. This is the destination - a remote village within the jurisdiction of Jingning County, Pingliang City, Gansu Province, where the electronic map failed to include the correct location. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Looking from a distance, this village almost looks like it grows on an earthy hillside, with buildings with red roofs and white walls stacked on top of each other around the mountainside. On November 16, 2023, the village was sparsely populated. The snow has melted, and an elderly couple is working in the fields, planning to hoe the soil to grow potatoes. The apples that the locals are proud of have been picked and sold, and the village is about to enter a slack period. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Nine days ago, a person close to the village was executed. His name is Zhang Longji, born in Jingning County in 1979, with a university education. According to the announcement of the Pingliang Intermediate Court, from 2010 to June 2019, when he served as the teaching director, principal and teacher of a primary school in Jingning County, he used corporal punishment and other means to form a mental coercion on primary school students who lacked sexual defense ability. He used explanation exercises, When students handed in homework and other opportunities, they repeatedly raped 5 young girls aged 8 to 12 years old in their dormitories, and repeatedly raped 17 girls aged 8 to 14 years old in public in the classroom or in their dormitories. Child molestation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Perhaps to protect the privacy of the victim, the court did not disclose the name of the elementary school where Zhang Longji taught. Southern Weekend reporters learned that the primary school where the incident occurred was the village primary school in the aforementioned village and had been withdrawn and merged in 2019. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;When the news that &quot;a primary school principal raped and molested 22 girls in 9 years&quot; caused an uproar on the Internet, this village in the eye of the storm seemed particularly silent. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;A small village in the mountains&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Especially in our village, don&#39;t ask about these things.&quot; Upon hearing Zhang Longji&#39;s name, villager Zhang Bi Peng&#39;s tone became stern. On November 16, 2023, he stood at the gate of the hospital and waved his hands to the Southern Weekend reporter as if to drive him away. &quot;It&#39;s all my sad past.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Zhang Bipeng’s yard is only a few hundred meters away from the original site of the primary school where the incident occurred. Only the couple lives at home, and his father, Zhang Pinghe, takes care of his grandson in Jingning County. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Zhang Pinghe is the old principal of the primary school where the incident occurred. He has taught in the village for more than 40 years and has now retired. On social platforms, he is called &quot;Perseverance in the Mountains.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Today, the empty and abandoned school building remains at the north end of the village. The gate is locked from the outside and cannot be entered. The outside of the courtyard is filled with corn stalks as high as the wall. Compared with the picture that appeared in the news ten years ago, the red roof of the elementary school bungalow still looks the same, and the exterior wall has turned white, as if it had been painted and repaired in the last few years, and the windows and doors are sealed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The yard next to the school is still open. There are only two old houses. One is piled with props for celebrating the New Year and the lion dance. The other has several An old, dusty wooden table with medals hanging on the wall. Among the dead branches and weeds, there are two green basketball hoops. A villager said that this area is the school playground. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The villager introduced that the primary school was merged in 2019, and then the children in the village went to the central primary school in the town. It was the first boarding school in the town. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Before the merger, this rural primary school was once a model in Jingning County. Among more than a dozen schools in the township, it ranked among the top three in performance every year. There are not many people in the school. When Sun Chuning, a staff member of the Jingning County Education Bureau, visited in 2015, there were only 29 students and 5 teachers in the school. Many students go to towns or counties with their migrant parents. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In 2015, Zhang Pinghe was still the principal, one or two years away from retirement. Sun Chuning had a good impression of the old principal, &quot;Teacher Zhang has been taking care of the school for decades, both during winter and summer vacations.&quot; He said he did not know Zhang Longji and did not pay attention to his situation when he visited the school. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The old principal has been commended repeatedly. According to public reports, he once took teachers to quarry clay to paint classrooms, went to a forest farm to collect waste materials to make simple tables and stools, and stayed at the school building to dig canals to divert water during heavy rains. Some netizens said in the comment area that in their memory, even the wife of the old principal pulled a trolley and worked in the school. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;A Pingliang photographer once shot a short film for the old principal when he was about to retire. He said that the photo was taken for &quot;awards and competitions&quot;. At the end of the film, the words &quot;Produced by Jingning County Education Bureau&quot; appear. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;At the same time, Zhou Lan, a school-age student who lived in a nearby village, came to this primary school to study. The school&#39;s reputation is one of the reasons why parents choose the school, but more importantly, it is almost his &quot;only solution&quot; for transportation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The surrounding area is inconvenient and there is no public transportation. Students measure distance by round-trip walking time, and anything that can be reached by walking in 30 minutes is considered &quot;very close.&quot; The map shows that Zhou Lan has to walk about 7 kilometers to the central primary school in the town, which takes an hour and a half on foot. At that time, &quot;there was an age requirement for living in school there, and you had to be in fifth grade or fourth grade.&quot; So Zhou Lan could only attend this village primary school. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The grandchildren of the old principal did not study in this village primary school, but were sent to the county town and are now studying in high school. Zhang Bipeng explained that it was because “the conditions in the county are good.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The number of teachers and students in rural primary schools is constantly decreasing. At its peak, the school had more than 200 students. A few years before Zhou Lan enrolled, there were more than 100 people in the school. “There were quite a lot of people at that time, but they all left in the end.” In a school evaluation and acceptance self-inspection report filled out by Zhang Pinghe in 2016, the school had only 21 students and 4 faculty members, divided into 4 teaching classes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The report states that the primary school was founded in 1957. It was expanded into a standardized primary school on the original site in 2002 and changed to a six-year complete primary school in 2003. The old principal wrote this paragraph in the report: The school carefully organizes teachers and students to study education laws and regulations, teachers&#39; law, and the Law on the Protection of the Rights and Interests of Minors. All teachers and students in the school know, understand and abide by the law. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Zhang Longji is one of the above-mentioned teachers. A relevant roster of Jingning County in 2014 shows that Zhang Longji was a professional technical level 12 and a primary school teacher level 2 at that time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In 2017, Zhang Longji took over as the principal of this village primary school. The transfer of teachers in rural schools is the responsibility of the local education bureau. The principal of a rural primary school in Gansu said that the position of principal must go through layers of selection before being qualified, including examinations and background training. “Each unit has to go through it again. For example, if there is a problem with your credit card, you will not be allowed to pass. , particularly strict.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;According to the court notice, Zhang Longji had been committing crimes for several years at this time. Why didn’t Zhang Longji’s actions attract attention during this period? As of press time, Zhang Pinghe had not responded to Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Jingning County Education Bureau stated that the relevant details involve the protection of minors, so it is inconvenient to disclose them. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“I didn’t understand it at that time, so I saw it as a joke”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;When Zhou Lan was studying in this village primary school, he saw Zhang Longji with his own eyes He molested students in the classroom, but felt he had no choice but to do anything about it because &quot;he is the principal.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;After the school was annexed and the school building was locked, Zhou Lan and several male classmates secretly climbed over the wall and entered. He said that Zhang Longji had two dormitories at the school, one of which belonged to his wife. The couple has two girls and one boy, and their three children sometimes come to live in the dormitory. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Zhou Lan said that he and his classmates tore off the seal on the dormitory door and held a &quot;special ceremony&quot; inside. According to the video sent by Zhou Lan, they placed a photo on a low table, placed three small trays in front of the photo, placed chocolate pie on it, and burned paper on the side. Before Zhang Longji&#39;s execution, this &quot;ceremony&quot; with the meaning of memorial was a kind of revenge. They have been held three times in total, the last time in October 2023. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Zhou Lan hated this teacher in her heart. He said that Zhang Longji often corporally punished and beat students, and he was very cruel. &quot;He took a stick and hit me on the head, (beating) to death, which cast a shadow on me.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;They are the last batch of students Zhang Longji taught and are now in junior high school. Zhou Lan recalled that before the incident in 2019, there were only three girls left in the school, and some had transferred away before. Zhang Longji would molest girls in front of him. When correcting homework in class, he would also call girls to the podium and molest them in public. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;He also heard from girls in the school that Zhang Longji would call them to the dormitory. When school was over in the evening, Zhang Longji would use excuses such as &quot;the homework was not finished&quot; to prevent female students from going home and keep them until after nine o&#39;clock in the evening. He said that he was still young at the time and had little idea of ​​what Zhang Longji did. He only thought it was strange and did not tell his parents. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;What Zhou Lan saw was just the tip of the iceberg. During an interview with Southern Weekend reporters, we learned that the incident of being molested by Zhang Longji was probably earlier than the time mentioned in the court notice and had occurred since his early years of teaching. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;From 2004 to 2005, Lulu was in the first grade of a primary school in the town, and Zhang Longji, who was about 25 years old at the time, was her math teacher. She recalled to Southern Weekend reporters that at that time the school was a bungalow and it was very cold in winter, so they used stoves to burn charcoal for heating. During math class, Zhang Longji would call a female student to the podium, hold her in his arms, and &quot;do some very intimate gestures&quot; in front of thirty or forty students in the class, in the name of checking her homework. She said that she had personally seen several girls in the class being hugged, and &quot;he would pick some of the prettier little girls.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Lulu herself is also a victim. Zhang Longji held her in his arms and breathed into her, &quot;I felt very strange, so I hid.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;By 2009, Professor Zhang Longji’s subject changed from mathematics to English. That year, Zhang Lei, a male student, was in the third grade. During class, Zhang Longji held the girl in his arms and taught her vocabulary, touched her face, and behaved affectionately. He saw a female classmate sitting on Zhang Longji&#39;s lap with a look of disgust on her face. Forced by the teacher&#39;s authority, she did not dare to make any big moves to resist. She could only twist her body to avoid his physical contact, but it did not have much effect. “I didn’t understand it at that time, so I just took it as a joke.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In the same year, during a break in class, fifth-grade Lin Ling said that she was lying on her back in class. When she was sleeping on the table, there were many students in the classroom, and Zhang Longji suddenly hugged her from behind. Lin Ling was frightened and quickly said, &quot;Hurry up and let me go.&quot; He let go. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;According to the accounts of former students, Zhang Longji’s obscene behavior lasted for a long time, and students of different grades were victimized. &quot;He should have been molesting girls since he first joined the workforce... My last class, my current class, my next class, including my sister&#39;s class all know about it.&quot; November 2023 , Lin Ling told Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Lin Ling said that female students did not dare to get along with Zhang Longji and were afraid of being hugged by him. They felt &quot;especially annoying&quot; and privately complained to each other &quot;Why is he That’s it again”. &quot;But we didn&#39;t even realize at the time that he was breaking the law.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Ignored help&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The first female students Zhang Longji molested Have tried to save myself. Lulu, who was 7 years old at the time, told her mother about this &quot;strange thing&quot;. Her mother didn&#39;t take it seriously and just thought it was an elder&#39;s love for children. &quot;She said that your math teacher thinks you are very good and feels sorry for you.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;During the parent-teacher conference, Zhang Longji would face Lulu’s mother Praise her and say that the little girl is &quot;very smart and well-behaved&quot;. Lulu analyzed that this strengthened her mother&#39;s judgment and made her feel that the young mathematics teacher was very responsible and appreciated her daughter, without any warning. Looking back, Lulu feels that rural parents “are very lacking in awareness in this regard.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Lin Ling agreed with this analysis. She euphemistically said that the adults in the village are relatively simple, traditional and conservative. Lin Ling, who was 12 years old at the time, told her mother that there was a teacher in school who always hugged female classmates during class and also hugged herself, but the answer she received was unexpected. &quot;My mother said that my thoughts were not sincere.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Talking about the memory of asking her parents for help in fifth grade to no avail, the adult Lin Ling hesitated for a few seconds. ,Sighed. &quot;Maybe he has a better personality, but the adults don&#39;t believe it.&quot; She told her mother two or three times, but when she saw her mother&#39;s reaction, she stopped mentioning it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In front of children and adults, Zhang Longji has two different faces. When facing students, he sometimes kissed and hugged them, and sometimes violently punished them. But when facing adults, in Lulu&#39;s words, he behaved politely and responsibly, &quot;it&#39;s quite invisible.&quot; His WeChat avatar is an ID photo with a red background, a Chinese character face, single eyelids, a wide nose, a smile, wearing a black suit and a red polka dot tie, and his hair is meticulously combed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Where Zhang Longji grew up, the villagers also had a good impression of him. Compared with the remote teaching villages, Xiaohe Village in Gangou Town, where Zhang Longji&#39;s home is located, is closer to Jingning County and has convenient transportation. In the eyes of the villagers, Zhang Longji is one of the few &quot;top students&quot; who has gone to university, with high academic qualifications and decent work. &lt;br>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;A villager said that Zhang Longji and his two sisters were both college students. After graduation, they earned money and renovated old houses in the village. A building was bought in the county seat. Zhang Longji&#39;s wife is a teacher. &quot;His wife is teaching. She is slim (dialect means thin) and her family is in good condition.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Now the Zhang family&#39;s house is vacant, the iron door is rusty and locked, unused bricks are piled in the inner courtyard, and the red paper on the porch has faded. The courtyard is scattered with yellow leaves floating off the branches. The above-mentioned villagers said with some sadness that Zhang Longji&#39;s family was poor when he was a child. The shoes his mother wore were made of rags without uppers. His father sold rapeseed and raised three college students with hard work. They never thought that he would go down the wrong path. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img img-id=&quot;73929&quot; group-id=&quot;0&quot; asset-id=&quot;70720&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23 /12/05/b9dc7b55d7.jpeg&quot; img-title=&quot;WechatIMG3262.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;The old house of Zhang Longji&#39;s family in Xiaohe Village, Jingning County, Pingliang City, Gansu Province.

Photo by Southern Weekend reporter Gao Yichen&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The last time the villagers saw Zhang Longji was in 2019. Some villagers remember that in April of that year, an old man died in the village, and Zhang Longji returned to the village to &quot;carry and bury the person.&quot; He was in &quot;good condition&quot; at the time, but he did not expect that the crime of rape and molestation was about to be exposed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;More than a month later, Zhang Longji was taken away by the police during the Dragon Boat Festival after a victim&#39;s family called the police. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Zhang Longji still has relatives who run a supermarket in Xiaohe Village. He said that Zhang Longji rarely returned to the village after settling in the county, and there was not much contact between the two parties. &quot;After the old man (Zhang Longji&#39;s parents) disappeared, he would not come back for a year or two. When he came back, he would have a quick meeting and we would not chat.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; >;He refused to recall when he learned that Zhang Longji molested students. &quot;These things have happened, and now everyone here knows that there is such a person. There are some things that we can&#39;t talk about in depth, can&#39;t say, and don&#39;t want to say.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; A 64-year-old villager still has a good impression of Zhang Longji, thinking that he is a decent person and behaves &quot;stablely.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;He may have never seen Zhang Longji&#39;s ruthless side. According to the students&#39; accounts, both boys and girls were beaten by Zhang Longji, and iron rods, steel bars, and mops were all &quot;weapons.&quot; A boy recalled that when he was 9 years old and in third grade, he was beaten so hard that he &quot;couldn&#39;t sit still for a month, and his buttocks were all black.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Violence makes seeking help more difficult. Lin Ling remembers that when he was in first grade, Zhang Longji kicked a boy from the front of the podium to the back of the classroom. &quot;No one dared to resist, really. Because he beat people so fiercely, we didn&#39;t dare to say anything.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;I never mentioned the past injuries again&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt; p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The most difficult time for Lin Ling to let go was watching her friend being hurt by Zhang Longji. One day when she was in the fourth or fifth grade, during extracurricular activities, she and her friends went to Zhang Longji&#39;s dormitory to hand in homework. Zhang just came back from playing ball and was naked in the dormitory, wearing only shorts. &quot;When we handed in our homework, he hugged my classmate and kissed him hard there. It scared me. I ran away quickly.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left; &quot;>;There were no other teachers around at that time. Lin Ling ran out and told another classmate what happened. The two comforted each other and said, &quot;It should be fine.&quot; About 10 minutes later, the classmate who was hugged came out of Zhang Longji&#39;s dormitory. Lin Ling asked about her situation, and the reply she received was &quot;nothing.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;I was very worried about that classmate of mine, but when we were young, we didn&#39;t dare to say anything.&quot; Lin Ling recalled. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;That memory became the shadow of her childhood. She always remembered that the female classmate who was being hugged was trying to resist and try to break free, but she was only a primary school student, thin and not very strong. Zhang Longji kept holding her and kissed her on the mouth. It was only after Lin Ling grew up that she realized, &quot;Every time we hand in homework or do anything else, we have to go to his separate dormitory.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Things are buried deep in the hearts of the two girls. &quot;I know (that incident did) a lot of harm to my classmate, but until now I haven&#39;t dared to ask her. She is now married, and the matter has never been mentioned again.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style =&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;For twenty years, most of the victims licked their wounds silently. After the news that &quot;a primary school principal raped and molested 22 girls in 9 years&quot; attracted attention, some people worried on social platforms: What will happen to the children who have been harmed? They still have a long way to go. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Sun Xuemei, the initiator of &quot;Girls Protection&quot; and deputy editor-in-chief of ifeng.com, told Southern Weekend reporters that after being sexually assaulted, children&#39;s psychology will change, even in the long term. Troubled, I hope that with the help of the local Women&#39;s Federation and other departments, the children can receive timely psychological intervention. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;She specifically reminded parents not to beat, scold or blame their children. &quot;This is not the child&#39;s fault. We need to make the child feel that the family is safe and that parents can accept talking and relying on them. If after such an incident, parents beat, scold and blame them, they will push the child into a more helpless situation. .&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The &quot;Girls Protection&quot; project team has been to many rural schools across the country to conduct sexual assault prevention courses. Sun Xuemei found that the common problem currently is the lack of sex education, and many people talk about sexual perversion. However, it can be seen from the gradually increasing reporting rate that people&#39;s awareness is improving. &quot;Only when everyone&#39;s awareness increases and they pay attention to this problem, and (the problem) is exposed more and more, will it be solved faster.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The end of Zhang Longji’s criminal behavior was due to the call to the police by the victim’s family in June 2019. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Zhou Lan recalled that at noon on the day of the incident, Zhang Longji drove away from school. Also disappearing was a female classmate from the school. &quot;After class, (I) saw that the girl was not there, so I told other teachers. I didn&#39;t know that until the next day.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;He heard from the girl’s sister that the girl tried her best to resist and was beaten with a heavy object by Zhang Longji and was seriously injured. The girl was sent to Jingning County Hospital, but her injuries were serious and she was sent to Lanzhou for medical treatment. Zhang Longji was later taken away by the police in Lanzhou. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In November 2019, 30-year-old Yu Tong met Zhang Longji in the detention center, and the two stayed in the same cell for three months. After completing his sentence in 2023, he provided his release certificate to Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In the prison cell, Zhang Longji wore a red vest, handcuffs and shackles. Yu Tong said that &quot;inmates&quot; all knew that he was suspected of rape and child molestation. During that period, Zhang Longji was often bullied by his fellow prisoners and had to be moved from one cell to another. Another &quot;inmate&quot; Zhao Wuping also confirmed that &quot;people like him are often bullied in there.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Zhao Wuping entered the detention center for drunk driving in July 2019. He was &quot;headache&quot; about his situation and did not want to chat with other people. But he remembered that Zhang Longji&#39;s condition at the time was &quot;not bad&quot; and he said, &quot;He will be released after being sentenced to more than ten years.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The seriousness of the matter obviously exceeded Zhang Longji&#39;s expectations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Pingliang Intermediate Court sentenced Zhang Longji to death for rape and deprivation of political rights for life; for child molestation, he was sentenced to ten years in prison; several crimes were punished concurrently. ,Decided to implement the death penalty, deprivation of political rights for life.

The article stated that the student threatened the entire class when handing out mid-term exam papers, hugged the teacher&#39;s lap and cried and made a fuss. He also knelt down and prayed to the teacher not to tell his parents about the test results. After being rejected, he threatened and insulted the teacher, causing the head teacher to be hospitalized due to sudden illness. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Parents protested collectively and picked up their children early to start a class strike. On November 29, the local education bureau issued a notice stating that the primary school was transferring a student to a parallel class. Parents of the students who were transferred to the class showed resistance, and many students did not attend school. They reported the matter online. Changtu County Education Bureau and Experimental Primary School... decided after research to cancel the class adjustment plan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What do you think of this incident? First, it is necessary to explore the nature of the student&#39;s problem. If what the above parents said is true, then from the fact that the student threatens the whole class, begs the teacher, and threatens and insults the teacher, it seems that the student may have behavioral problems, but the specific problem is still difficult to determine. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, it is not difficult to understand the position of the parents of Class 8: originally the class order and discipline were good, but suddenly a &quot;troublemaker&quot; and &quot;trouble maker&quot; came, making other children uneasy and affecting their learning. No one will welcome it, cause tensions, or even upset children&#39;s moods. If you can&#39;t turn them away before you come, it will be difficult to ask them to leave after they come. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Because a student in a class has behavioral problems or character problems, disrupts classroom order or bullies other students; or parents are overprotective of their children and have serious conflicts with other children and their parents. , As a result, other parents can&#39;t bear it anymore, and they &quot;go on strike&quot; in anger, go to the Education Bureau to petition, and complain online. This often happens. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2019, parents of fifth graders at Hangzhou Wenlan Experimental School published an open letter online saying that a student named W was an overprotected child by his parents. If he had any disputes with teachers or classmates at school, his parents would directly They stormed schools and classrooms, and repeatedly threatened and abused the children, parents, and even teachers in extreme ways. For this reason, parents went on strike in anger. A situation report issued by the school stated that &quot;an incident occurred in Class 505 of our school where many students asked for leave but did not come to school to study.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Secondly, the way the school and the local education bureau handle such incidents is nothing more than trying their best to mediate and persuade. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Changtu County Experimental Primary School gave up its plan to adjust classes, saying it &quot;will further optimize educational resources, rationally allocate teachers, and teach students in accordance with their aptitude.&quot; The implication is that the students with the problem will continue to remain in Class 11, but it seems that they will be replaced by teachers who are more resistant and more capable to tackle the problem. &quot;Currently, students have fully returned to school,&quot; and the problem has been temporarily resolved. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the case of the strike at Hangzhou Wenlan Experimental School, a joint special class composed of the District Education Bureau and the District Public Security Bureau was established, and then a parent interview meeting was held to &quot;carefully listen to the parents&#39; feedback and demands.&quot; “Both parties actively communicated to eliminate differences, and after discussions, a preliminary consensus was reached.” Students who asked for leave “returned to school one after another” that afternoon. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Why are similar solutions so common? This is because the current Compulsory Education Law stipulates that students who violate the school management system shall be criticized and educated by the school and shall not be expelled (Article 27). Under such constraints, if there are &quot;problem children&quot; in a class who are considered unbearable by many parents, they can only tolerate it at the beginning. If they can&#39;t bear it anymore, they will use strikes, petitions, and open letters online to try to overcome the pressure of public opinion. Let the &quot;problem children&quot; transfer to another school; if they really can&#39;t be driven away, well-connected parents will consider transferring their children to another school. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, there are many people on the Internet who say, and their voices are quite loud: Isn’t it enough to transfer “problem children” to vocational schools for correction? This simplifies the problem. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Indeed, Article 6 of the Law on the Prevention of Juvenile Delinquency stipulates: The state shall strengthen the construction of specialized schools and provide specialized education to minors with serious bad behaviors. So, what constitutes serious bad behavior? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The bad behavior defined in this law refers to &quot;behavior carried out by minors that is not conducive to their healthy growth&quot;, such as truancy and truancy for many times; associating with people with bad habits in society, organizing or Joining a gang that commits bad behavior, etc. Obviously, it is fine if bad behavior only harms oneself. The key is that many bad behaviors have negative externalities and will harm other children. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Article 31 of the Law stipulates: Schools shall strengthen management and education for underage students who have bad behaviors and shall not discriminate; for those who refuse to correct or the circumstances are serious, the school may punish them according to the circumstances or take the following measures: Management education measures: provide discipline; require compliance with specific codes of conduct; require participation in specific special education; require participation in on-campus service activities; require psychological counseling and behavioral intervention from social workers or other professionals, etc. But obviously not including expulsion. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The so-called serious bad behavior refers to &quot;behavior committed by minors that is stipulated in the criminal law and not subject to criminal punishment because they are under the legal age of criminal responsibility, as well as behavior that seriously endangers society&quot;, such as fighting in groups, chasing , intercepting others, forcibly taking or arbitrarily damaging or occupying public or private property and other provocative and troublemaking behaviors; beating, insulting, threatening, or intentionally injuring others&#39; bodies, etc. So can someone with this kind of behavior be immediately sent to a vocational school? Neither. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Article 41 of the Law stipulates: For minors who have serious bad behavior, the public security organs may take the following corrective and educational measures according to the specific circumstances: admonish them; order them to apologize and compensate for losses; order them to declare repentance. ; Ordered to regularly report on activities; ordered to abide by specific behavioral norms and not to perform specific behaviors, contact specific people, or enter specific places; ordered to receive psychological counseling and behavioral modification; ordered to participate in social service activities, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If a minor commits an act that seriously endangers society, the circumstances are egregious or causes serious consequences, or if a minor commits an act that seriously endangers society multiple times, or refuses to accept or cooperate with the corrective education measures stipulated in Article 41 above, Upon evaluation and approval by the Specialized Education Steering Committee, the education administrative department together with the public security organs may decide to send the student to a specialized school to receive specialized education. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It can be seen that students only disrupt classroom discipline and bully other students, which is not considered &quot;serious bad behavior&quot;. It is impossible to be expelled and it is impossible to go to a vocational school. However, this type of behavior is enough to cause great consequences. Externalities make other children and even teachers and parents miserable. Within the above framework, the problem is difficult to solve, and I am afraid it will still happen from time to time in the future. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 05 Dec 2023 22:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[持有不超十天、覆盖数千只股票、年换手率百倍中国量化投资的股市“淘金术”]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261894]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-12-05 21:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;In the second half of 2023, as the A-share volatility intensified, approaching 3,000 points several times, &quot;quantitative trading&quot; became The focus of controversy in China’s capital market. The market has set off rounds of discussions around whether quantitative funds are &quot;tools for cutting leeks and vampires of the stock market.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But the leading quantitative funds, which have always been low-key, continue to make news. At the end of August, according to reports from multiple media outlets including Securities Times and Brokerage China, Qiu Huiming, founder of Minghong Investment, purchased Shanghai’s “first luxury home” for 285 million yuan. At the end of October, news of an extramarital affair among the founders of another leading quantitative company, Magic Square, spread widely in the asset management circle. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A private equity firm chairman told a Southern Weekend reporter: &quot;The biggest problem with quantitative funds is that no one has publicly disclosed specific operating methods.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Mysterious quantitative investment How exactly does it work? Why does quantitative investing become the target of public criticism during a stock market downturn? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporters recently interviewed a large number of domestic quantitative investors. What&#39;s interesting is that they are eager to explain to the outside world what quantification is, but they also want to hide behind the scenes - &quot;Low-key, we must be low-key.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Simons’ followers&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In 2010, the American high-speed network provider Spread Networks spent US$300 million to build a long-distance network between Chicago and New York. The straightest optical cable of 1,330 kilometers only shortens the time for high-frequency traders to obtain information by 0.003 seconds. Michael Lewis tells this true story in his book &quot;High Frequency Traders: Wall Street&#39;s Speed ​​Game.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this year, China&#39;s CSI 300 stock index futures were officially launched, providing a hedging tool for domestic quantitative investment. Many Chinese returned to China from Wall Street to start their own businesses. 2010 is therefore recognized as the first year of quantification in China. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To date, a leading quantitative private equity fund executive has provided data to Southern Weekend reporters: Domestic funds plus overseas funds such as Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect and QFII currently account for the total turnover of quantitative transactions in the A-share market. The proportion is 25%-30%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;James Simons, the &quot;Father of Quantitative Investment&quot;, is the spiritual mentor of this group of practitioners. Most of the interviewees mentioned the book &quot;The Man Who Conquered the Market&quot;. This book records the story of how Simons successfully transformed mathematical algorithms and computer trading software into &quot;stock market gold mining&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The book mentions that the origin of quantitative investment can be traced back to the late 1980s. Before this, no one believed that computers could invest like humans, but Simons and the quantitative investors behind him firmly believed: &quot;There must be a way to model prices.&quot; They do not believe that the market is a &quot;random walk&quot; that is unpredictable. Although there is a certain degree of randomness, if a certain probability distribution is used, future price trends can be predicted. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among James Simmons’ followers, there are more Chinese than most people imagine. A high-frequency trader who returned to China in 2015 still can’t figure out why there are so many Chinese doing quantitative work in the United States. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;The Chinese account for at least one -third of the proportion. They are spreading all over the New York Stock Exchange and various institutions of Nasdaq, either IT or data models.&quot; He told the southern weekend reporter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; However, Sam, the founder of a domestic head quantified agency, believes that this is well understood, &quot;Chinese people are not outstanding in other aspects. Investment banks are also good, but do you know people?&quot; &lt;/&lt;/&lt;/&lt;/&lt;/&lt;/&lt;/&lt;/&lt;/&lt;/&lt;/&lt;/&lt;/&lt;/&lt;/&lt;/ P>; &lt;p>; After graduating from Dr. SAM, he became a high -frequency trader on Wall Street. He tried a procedural transaction in the domestic market around 2006. &quot;But at that time, the domestic market data took 15 seconds to me, and the order was 15 seconds to the exchange. &quot;. SAM told reporters from the Southern Weekend that it should not exceed 3 seconds back and forth, and delay will bring price changes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In June 2013, the new &quot;People&#39;s Republic of China Securities Investment Fund Law&quot; was officially implemented. Private equity was allowed to record and open an account. You can issue autonomous products without the need to use the securities firm channel. This year SAM returned to China. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;When returning to China, the speed can reach within 1 second, and now the Shenzhen Exchange can achieve a few milliseconds. However, in the US market, everyone is pursuing microseconds (one millisecond is equal to 1000 microseconds). &quot;He said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; At this stage, some senior people of some overseas -top quantitative institutions began to return to China to start a business, including Ren Sihong of Jinyu Assets, Wang Chen invested by Jiu Kun, Xu Xiaobo, who invested in Ruitian, Qiu Huiming invested by Mingzheng, and Yin Yin, Yin Yin, Yin Yin Xu Shunan and others of Nuo assets. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In 2014, Cai Meijie, deputy president of CICC Sales and Exchange Department, founded the establishment of Lingjun Investment; in 2015, the three Zhejiang University Computer Department, including Xu Jin, shifted from the IT field to a versatile investment, and created a fantasy party to create a fantasy party Quantify. Fantasy Fang, Ming Hong, Jiukun, and Ling are all called the &quot;Four Great Kings&quot;, and each asset management scale exceeds 60 billion yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In 2015, China ’s quantitative private equity is mainly hedge products. In the second half of 2015, the stock index futures were limited, and the overall scale of private equity in three years did not increase and fall. In 2021, quantitatively entered a period of rapid development. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;2021 is the most lively year. The industry scale is basically doubled. &quot;A quantitative practitioner told the southern weekend reporter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; At this stage, Mingzheng Investment and Fantasy Fang Investment once expanded the management scale to 100 billion yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;H4>; &lt;strong>; &quot;Where is the talent &lt;/strong>; &lt;strong>;, &lt;/strong>; &lt;strong>; Where are we&quot; &lt;/strong>; &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; , China quantitatively the &quot;Four King of Heaven&quot; fantasy, Jiu Kun, Lingjun, Minghong, etc. all have office sites. They are close to the Tsinghua Science and Technology Park, Zhongguancun Chuangye Street and other places. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; This site is selected because &quot;where is the talent and where are we.&quot; These companies have gathered high students from famous universities around the world, including Stanford, Cambridge, and MIT. On the propaganda wall of an institution, Qingbei Zhejiang University ranked the last three. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;There are many people in the head quantified company,&quot; a practitioner told a southern weekend reporter. When there was a quantitative investment institution recruited people, it proposed that &quot;the winner of the Tsinghua Yao Ban and the Olympic Medal will not take it.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In 2005, Yao Qizhi, a world -renowned computer scientist and founder of the world&#39;s modern cryptographic foundation, founded the Tsinghua Academy&#39;s computer science experimental class. This class was referred to as &quot;Yao Ban&quot;. There is a saying that &quot;China&#39;s talents in Tsinghua, Tsinghua&#39;s talents in Yao Ban&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The original intention of Yao Ban was to screen and cultivate the world&#39;s most top computer genius. A graduate of Tsinghua University described this, &quot;This is the most tip -to -pointed person in the nation&#39;s number one computer department.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Most of these young people are post -90s and men and women. They knocked on the keyboard in the office, and there were four huge computer screens on the desk. At a glance, it is a line of code data. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The division of labor in traditional subjective funds is that analysts provide information, fund managers make decisions, and traders specifically execute order transactions according to the instructions of the fund manager. &quot;The quantitative fund has no concept of trader or trader, but is called a strategic developer and quantitative engineer.&quot; Wang Xiong, the founder of Siyuan quantified, told the southern weekend reporter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The person who sets the model is the core person of the quantitative company. The model is composed of people+computing power. The development of quantitative trading strategies involves technologies such as mathematical models, statistical analysis, machine learning. Engineers will write and test code, and use historical data for recovery to evaluate the potential performance of the strategy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Therefore, their work content can be summarized as three words &quot;writing code&quot;, &quot;more like a code farmer&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In February 2023, the head quantitative company&#39;s fantasy recipe and Ruitian Investment Division, the reason is that Rui Tian Investment took away the team and joined the fantasy party. Due to the long -term high contact of the strategist personnel, the strategy personnel have been highly exposed to heights for a long time. Core business secrets in quantitative investment -quantitative trading strategy code, Ruitian Investment believes that the other party is suspected of business secrets and improper competition. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In addition to the competition of talents, quantitative funds also need to compete for computing power. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;China holding the most high -performance GPU institutions is not an artificial intelligence company, but a quantitative investment company, and the fantasy party is the first.&quot; A domestic GPU agent told Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The CPU familiar to ordinary people is responsible for reading the original data, temporarily exist in memory, and the GPU is to calculate the data of the data and the model of the training model. Brain experience. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; A person in the IT industry told the southern weekend reporter: &quot;CPUs are also dozens of physical Cores, and the GPU has tens of thousands of CUDA Core.&quot; Core can be understood as the core of the operation and use GPU to train a big one. The model is probably monthly, correspondingly. If the traditional CPU is probably annually calculated, the training efficiency is huge, and the gap between the reasoning efficiency is more than 100 times. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Nvidia A100 graphics card is a professional GPU, which is very powerful and can reach 19.5 TFLOPS (floating -point operations of 19.5 trillion times per second). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In 2019, AI company was established with a quantitative formula, equipped with 1,100 GPUs. In 2021, the Nvidia A100 graphics card owned by the magic side has reached tens of thousands. The above IT people are shocked by this number, which has broken through the reserves of some major Internet factories in China. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; SAM explanation, starting in 2016, quantitative investment is based on the low -frequency Alpha plus T+0 (within the daily circulation transaction) as the main style. After 2018, it is a full -cycle model and deep learning model. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;Assuming that if you do a deep learning model, the researchers need to keep trying to try different parameters, structures, and characteristics. A researcher can get dozens of cards. Of course They are all occupied, but it is difficult for a person to think of so many ideas at the same time. &quot;&lt;/P>; &lt;p>; For a researcher, you can configure dozens of cards. The above IT industry people think that this is bragging. He graduated from Tsinghua, and he made a model quantified in a large factory, and the configuration was one card alone. &amp; nbsp; &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>; &lt;strong>; &quot;&lt;/strong>; &lt;strong>; Covers near &lt;/strong>; &lt;strong>; 2000 &lt;/strong>; &lt;strong>; Only stocks &lt;/strong>; &lt;strong>; &lt;/strongRong >; &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; Few people know how to make money for quantitative investment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; A personal investor who purchased the fantasy -based quantitative product, he pointed at the romantic story of quantitative giants. But for quantitative investment, she admitted to the southern weekend reporter: &quot;I don&#39;t understand.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The chairman of a private equity fund with a scale of another fund management scale has invested a lot of family assets into the head quantitative company. His understanding of quantitativeization is to mass slaughter according to the behavior model of tourism and retail investors, and the quantitative self -employed strategies and transactions are preferred by asset management. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Yang Delong, chief economist of Qianhai Open Source Fund, explained to the south weekend reporter with the &quot;dog walking theory&quot;. &quot;Value investment is more concerned about the walking route of people (fundamentals), but quantification is mainly to make excess returns by discovering the movement of dogs (stock prices).&quot; Yang Delong said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Quantitative transactions, overseas called &quot;Quantitative Trading&quot; or &quot;Quantitative Investment&quot;, Quantitative (quantified) is corresponding to Discretionary. The latter refers to the judgment and understanding of one thing, the decision -making process depends on personal judgment, and has a greater degree of freedom. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;Quantitative data is based on data, with the mathematical model (statistical model) as the core, it is completely based on data. We call it quantitative and subjective investment is more qualitative.&quot; Sam To the southern weekend reporter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In his opinion, both individual investors and institutional investors, everyone has behavioral inertia, but the way of thinking may not be completely rational, and it will make mistakes in the process. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; He divides quantification into two parts. The quantitative analysis of fundamentals is very similar to the publicity of publicity, cash flow and other public data. However, in the other part, quantification will grasp the wrong transactions of the market, that is, deviate from a reasonable price transaction formulated by quantitative models. &quot;After catching the wrong transaction, we buy it as if it is lower than the reasonable price, and sell it higher than the reasonable price.&quot; &lt;/P>; &lt;p>; Taking Moutai as an example, subjective investment may judge that the stock will rise, but the quantification will clearly have a clearly one. Forecast: &quot;We will say that this stock will win 1%of the market in the next 10 days, and the error is ± 5%, which is completely a statistical concept.&quot; &lt;/P>; &lt;p>; Data -based), the company&#39;s stock price shows a certain regular distribution. This reasonable price refers to a range. &quot;A quantitative practitioner told the southern weekend reporter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Yang Delong believes that quantification and value investment are essentially different. &quot;Quantitativeness is more to make money by fluctuations in stock prices, so they are called cutting leeks. Value investment is generally held for several years. &quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Quantitative practitioners do not avoid it. Most of the domestic mainstream quantitative private equity uses statistical arbitrage as its core strategy. The prediction cycle ranges from within a few days to a few days, and generally does not exceed 10 days. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; There are no standards and characteristics of quantitative selection of stocks, and do not set up industries and fields. They do not pay attention to whether the enterprise has new products, nor does it pay attention to what the secretary said. When the stock price is calculated based on the model, it belongs to the &quot;super buy&quot;, and the quantification will directly touch the selling stocks, and there is no human emotional and subjective judgment in the middle. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; A number of head quantitative practitioners told reporters from the Southern Weekend that a mature large -scale quantitative company will scan more than 5,000 stocks on the market. Good can be done, and the mobility is not good. The difference is that they earn more and less money. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;Our bottom warehouse has now covered nearly 2,000 stocks of A shares.&quot; SAM told Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Compared with it, 50 stocks holding 50 shares are considered many. This brings a huge difference in the turnover rate. A broker person told the southern weekend reporter: &quot;The turnover rate of public funds for equity is generally 3-5 times, up to about 10 times, which is more active.&quot; &lt;/ P>; &lt;p>; Quantitative practitioners provided by reporters from the south weekend is that most of the mainstream products of the current quantitative private placement are generally 50-100 times. above. The annual exchange rate of the quantitative strategy of stock is about 100 times, which is equivalent to the average holding cycle of about 5 days. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Sam decided to return to China to start a business in 2013. One of the important reasons is that &quot;the proportion of domestic individual investors at that time could reach 90%, and the entire market was too speculative. Alpha can be 6%, but at that time the domestic market could achieve nearly 40%. &quot;&lt;/P>; &lt;p>; Alpha and Beta were the risk quantitative indicators proposed by the Nobel Prize winner William Sharp in 1964. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Quantitative company relies on thousands of Alpha to find various laws in the market. Southern Weekend reporters visited a number of domestic head quantitative companies in mid -November. In their office areas, Alpha&#39;s &quot;A&quot; was made in the most eye -catching position. Alpha and Beta are also frequent words in the mouth of practitioners. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Yang Lei is a post -90s private equity supervisor. He gave the southern weekend reporter as an example. If he was pursuing Alpha&#39;s strategy, assuming that the broader market (with Wind A full A index as an example) increased by 10%a year and a certain strategy rose 12%. ) It is 2%. If the strategy can maintain this excess level, the market fell by 10%in the second year, and the strategy will only fall 8%, or there is still a 2%excess income. The pursuit of Alpha refers to the pursuit of long -term can win the broader market. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; If it is pursuing Beta, it is a concept of multiple. For example, the market has risen by 10%this year, and a strategy has risen by 1.5*10%= 15%, but if the market fell 10%the next year, it was 10%. It will also fall 1.5*10%= 15%. It is equal to the fluctuations of the broader market. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Can you win the market for quantitative investment? According to the private equity duct network, as of the end of the third quarter of 2023, the average quantitative private equity revenue of 537 more than the performance was 3.36%, and the proportion of positive returns accounted for more than 70%. The average value of tens of billions of quantitative private equity is 5.75%, and the proportion of positive income companies accounted for over 90%. &lt;br>; &lt;br>; SAM said to the reporter of the Southern Weekend: &quot;Quantitativeness is stronger than subjective in the short -term reasonable pricing ability, but in the middle and long periods of reasonable pricing In -depth analysis, this is not currently quantified. &lt;br>; &lt;br>; Even the Renaissance Technology Corporation founded by James Simmons, after many years of high -speed growth, the three funds of their three funds also performed bleak in 2020. According to Bloomberg reports in February 2021, the Bloomberg reported that the three funds opened by the Renaissance to ordinary investors have been redeemed at least 5 billion US dollars (about 32.2 billion yuan) since December 1, 2020. &lt;/p>; &lt;H4>; &lt;strong>; Quantitative dispute &lt;/strong>; &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; On August 27, 2023, &quot;reduced sealing stamp duty, staged tightening IPO, re -financing rhythm, regulatory shares to reduce holdings Behavioral and reduced financing margin ratio &quot;, the favorable policies have been arrowed in one day. However, the next day, the A -share opening was 5%higher and fell quickly, and the closing increase was only 1%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Who is the culprit? Quantitativeization has become the target of public criticism. Many investors believe that the opening of the market has triggered a huge quantitative fund to sell, and the latter is the &quot;largest air force&quot; of market fluctuations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; A saliva battle began in the circle of friends who invest in big brothers. Investors who oppose quantitativeization have brushed the article &quot;Quantitative Fund, the main force of today&#39;s Smiling&quot; to 100,000+, and the founders of many head quantitative agencies reprinted another article- &quot;Quantitative is the Big Bya of the Big A&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; On September 1, 2023, the Securities and Futures Commission guided the Stock Exchange to introduce a series of measures to strengthen the procedural transaction supervision. Among them, &quot;transaction behaviors with a maximum application of the highest declaration reached more than 300 or more per second, or the maximum number of declarations in a single day reached more than 20,000 transactions&quot; and so on. And make additional reports of high -frequency transactions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; But a number of interviewed quantitative practitioners said: &quot;300 and 20,000 declared standards per second and the standards of 20,000 reports have little impact on quantification.&quot; The number of strokes reaches 20,000, the account is small, but it can be done very high. But if you change your hands and large scale, this number is also possible. SAM Example: For example, a public offer has a billions of accounts, and it is not high to change hands. There are only 5%unilateral one day and only 10%in bilateral. There are also more than 20,000 pens. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;If you see the transaction opportunity, 5,000 stocks have the opportunity. In theory, we can realize 5,000 orders in one second. At most 1,000, &quot;SAM told the southern weekend reporter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Quantitative practitioners have repeatedly emphasized that programmatic transactions are not only pointing out transactions. Procedural transactions refer to investment tools corresponding to &quot;manual transactions&quot;. Thousands of assets, and manual transactions cannot be done. In addition to quantitative and private equity, public offering funds and subjective investment will also use programmatic transactions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The huge fluctuations in A shares in 2015, and Ishton manipulated the futures market case. The company is illegally profitable to make more than 2 billion yuan in transaction rules such as procedural trading software, self -buying and selling, and using the ratio of margin leverage ratio. The average order speed of Ishton is one per second. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; SAM said that stock index futures are particularly suitable for high -frequency varieties. Ionton was the second level that year, and it has not changed much. But &quot;there are fewer people who speculate in futures, and they are gambling, and the mainstream is mainly based on stock quantification.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The founder of Siyuan quantitative Wang Xiong told the southern weekend reporter: &quot;As far as the quantitative stocks are concerned, A -share transactions cannot have high frequencies of so -called ultimate pursuit of speed in foreign countries.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; From the perspective of the transaction mechanism, due to the imposed stamp duty, recognized high -frequency transactions in China&#39;s stock market basically do not exist. &quot;Because you can&#39;t make money, the speed advantage of a few seconds, the money you earn can&#39;t cover the stamp duty.&quot; Sam told the southern weekend reporter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; According to him, the shortest position in China is currently 5 minutes to 20 minutes. It can not be regarded as high frequency overseas. At most, it is only within daytime transactions. At one time, it was only a few minutes slow. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Sam still remember that when he was a high -frequency trader on Wall Street, he kept changing his hands, and 10 million US dollars could build up to $ 200 million. &quot;In China, our holding positions are about 5 days. In these 5 days, we are not pursuing how to grab this list as soon as possible, but to pursue a better excess performance.&quot; &lt;/P>; &lt;p>; In addition, the matching of the exchange of the exchange The speed is not supported. &quot;As an example, you send a list in the past, and it takes 30 milliseconds to wait for the return. Everyone in the United States is pursuing 1 microsecond, so you 30 milliseconds ± 1 millisecond fluctuations. Pursuing that 1 microsecar is meaningless. . &quot;Sam told the reporter from the Southern Weekend. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; But they are actually trying to pursue speed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; A founder of a quantitative agency revealed to the reporter of the Southern Weekend that the domestic exchanges have their own server custody centers for traders who require trading speed. , Shenzhen Stock Exchange South Center Shenzhen Tong Tukai Machine Room and Shanghai Stock Exchange Golden Bridge Custody Machine Room. Only securities and futures companies can rent the custody machine room cabinets from the exchange. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; High -end programmatic trading teams usually purchase their own equipment or specify the designated hardware configuration. They are purchased by securities and futures companies. With the consent of securities and futures companies, they are placed in the rental cabinets for transactions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Around 2014, Huabao Securities launched the LTS system, which is the first speed trading counter system in the industry. Since then, many brokers have begun to &quot;fire -fighting speed transactions&quot;, and most of them are quantitative private equity customers. , But there is a threshold for the amount of funds. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;The funding threshold for the speed trading counter is not a hard rule, but we generally publicize it is the exclusive to high net worth customers. Each threshold is different, some are 1 million yuan, and some 3 million yuan.&quot; One Brokers told the southern weekend reporter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; A private equity institution practitioner said to the southern weekend reporter: &quot;Now the larger quantitative funds, high frequencies are used for self -employment, operated by self -operated funds and leverage. The performance is asset management. How many times. &quot;But the self -operated scale data cannot be queried. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_GB2312, stkaiti;&quot;>; (responding request: SAM, Yang Lei as a pseudonym) &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 05 Dec 2023 21:25:05 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[出生3个月被拐，25年后找回：新技术助力“天下无拐”丨快评]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261899]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-12-05 20:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Recently, there is news that Hebei “billionaire” Xie Kefeng has recovered his son Xie Qingshuai who has been trafficked for 25 years. It was widely circulated on the Internet and attracted great attention. Netizens were happy that the Xie family was finally reunited. And behind this, it is inseparable from the blessing of technological power. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to media reports, the &quot;cross-age face comparison algorithm of relatives&quot; developed by a technology company was indispensable for the family reunion. Xie Qingshuai was only 3 months old when he was abducted, and his family only has photos of him when he was 3 months old. More than twenty years later, it is obviously an &quot;impossible task&quot; to use this baby photo to find someone. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What makes the impossible possible is to use related faces to compare and find suspected objects. Taking the search for Xie Qingshuai as an example, photos of his biological parents and eldest brother were used to compare with the police&#39;s population database. This comparison is of course relatively vague and may result in multiple results, but it also greatly narrows the scope of the search, making it easier for the police to conduct precise comparisons through DNA testing and other technologies. In this comparison, Qing Shuai was found among the top five suspects. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The “black technology” used to find abducted children, the most familiar to the public is DNA comparison technology. This technology was first used by the police to identify criminal suspects in major criminal cases. As the cost of testing and comparison decreases, the application of DNA technology is becoming more and more widespread, and it also plays a role in the final &quot;final decision&quot; to determine kinship in the fight against trafficking and finding relatives. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, DNA comparison also has great limitations, that is, samples from both parties are required for comparison. Parents searching for relatives will naturally take the initiative to submit their own blood samples to the police, but it is not that easy to obtain samples from abducted children. DNA information is one of the most sensitive biological information of an individual. Without sufficient evidence to suspect, the police cannot force anyone to submit their DNA sample at will. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many of the children’s data in the police anti-trafficking DNA database were submitted to the police by people who knew they had been trafficked, hoping to find their biological parents. Other data comes from trafficked persons rescued by the police during anti-trafficking operations. For those trafficked persons who do not know they are being trafficked and have not been noticed by the police, their DNA information will not appear in the anti-trafficking database and will not be found. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Currently, the police have set up more than 3,000 free blood collection points across the country and publicized them widely, hoping that more people would volunteer to provide blood samples and increase the coverage of the anti-trafficking database. But the number of people who can be included in the DNA database is always limited. In the past, a common method used by families searching for relatives was “human flesh” search. They follow any possible clues and travel all over the country to find relatives all year round, spending time, energy and money. However, the results are very unsatisfactory and very few can actually find the abducted children. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The application of high-tech means such as face comparison and recognition has greatly improved the efficiency of finding relatives. As early as 2019, the police began to use the cross-age facial recognition technology developed by Tencent, and successfully found a child who had been abducted for 10 years using a photo of the abducted child when he was 3 years old. But the technology at the time was not precise enough. According to his father, at that time, 100 suspected persons were found for each identification. The police usually selected the top 5 for DNA review, and the probability of missing a hit was very high. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;With the advancement of computer vision and artificial intelligence technology, the accuracy of comparison is getting higher and higher. You can even compare using only photos of close relatives without having to take photos of the child himself. Because everyone has their ID card photo stored in the police database, using photos for identification greatly increases the scope of anti-trafficking comparisons, making it easier to find abducted children. The &quot;cross-age relative face comparison algorithm&quot; helped the police recover four abducted children in just six months, at least three of whom had been abducted for more than 20 years, which shows its ability. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Advanced technology is used to fight abduction and find relatives, which is a good cause. Of course, it must be admitted that if used for evil, its destructive power will be huge. For example, a DNA paternity test may be used to forge paternity test certificates and settle the abducted children at the police station as their &quot;biological&quot; children. Of course, this is fraud, and it may also be said that it has little to do with technology. However, ubiquitous facial recognition is suspected of being abused in large quantities and may infringe on the privacy rights of ordinary people. Technologies such as AI face-changing may also be used in crimes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There used to be a saying on the Internet that &quot;where there are photos, there is the truth.&quot; But with the development of PS technology, photos can no longer represent the truth. Some people use face-swapping techniques to replace the avatars in pornographic photos and use them for blackmail. And with the advancement of video face-changing technology, it is no longer true that &quot;there is a video and there is the truth&quot;. The current AI technology can allow Trump to speak authentic Chinese, with flawless timbre and mouth shape, and it is no problem to fake other videos. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Technology itself is neutral. Every black technology is a double-edged sword that can be used for good or for evil. Not only can technology itself be used for evil, but advanced technology can also be used to do evil. As soon as the high-tech cross-age face matching technology for finding relatives attracted attention, rumors of a &quot;paid version of the relative finding app&quot; appeared on the Internet. Families looking for relatives who are eager to find their own flesh and blood are easily deceived and defrauded of their money. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Advanced technology contains huge power. How to use it, for good or evil, all depends on the thoughts of those who master the technology. Only by keeping technology in the hands of &quot;good people&quot; as much as possible, and with good systems for incentives and prevention, can technology be used to its fullest potential. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, as costs continue to fall, these new technologies will inevitably be available to more and more people, and the possibility of abuse and misuse will become greater and greater. How to prevent advanced technology from being used for evil as much as possible is also a serious issue that must be discussed. The &quot;Gongdou Drama&quot; of OpenAI, which developed ChatGPT some time ago, is related to the attitude towards AI technology to a certain extent. It can be seen that this is no longer a topic of unfounded worry, but an urgent one. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 05 Dec 2023 20:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[厦门警方通报2名老师涉嫌性侵大四女生]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261932]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-12-05 19:39:47&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;span>;On the evening of December 4, 2023, “Many teachers from well-known middle schools in Xiamen assaulted and raped them while drunk.

Visual China | Picture&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I was sitting on a small round stool in the outdoor corridor. The stool was short, not very stable, and had no backrest. My feet, which had taken off my shoes, were stepping on a stained floor. I couldn’t walk around on the small carpet because I had to be ready to try on shoes at any time. Fortunately, it was October and I actually felt a cool breeze. Compared to four months ago (mid-June) when I came to order shoes, I was so sweaty that it was so comfortable. too much. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Just sit down and sit down! It has been more than an hour, but it is still better than the shoemaker. It is hard enough to watch him open the soles of the shoes and close the uppers, nailing and hammering. So, although the custom-made shoes have nothing to do with the shape of my feet. They match each other, but they are a bit polar opposite, and they are incompatible with each other. Once the feet are put in, it is as painful as &quot;cutting off the feet to fit the shoes&quot;, but when I heard him repeatedly saying, &quot;It&#39;s okay, what&#39;s wrong with you? I&#39;ll do it for you, I&#39;ll do it for you.&quot; Done.&quot; I saw the enthusiasm and confidence on his face, while he was wandering around the studio filled with debris, looking for insoles and playing with shoe lasts. His movements were slow. He was not in a hurry. I How can you be anxious? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Because I was bored sitting around, I could only look around. This is the upper floor of a factory building. There is a long row of rooms, one after another, facing a long gray corridor outside the door. , there was no one on the promenade, only the shoe store was open. If custom-made shoes hadn&#39;t come to my door, I believe I would never have come to this quiet area in the New Territories. It takes a taxi from where I live, and it costs hundreds of dollars for a round trip. However, because of a pair of feet with many problems, including hallux valgus, flat feet and fasciitis, I have been unable to find comfortable shoes for many years. , I can only hope that I will become Cinderella. One day, a pair of shoes made in heaven will suddenly appear. Once you put on a pair of shoes, you can walk or dance gracefully. If this is the case, then you will not care about anything. I immediately worked hard to pursue it without any expense. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to relieve my worries, my elder brother in Toronto found information from the Internet. He said that there is a mysterious man in Hong Kong who specializes in custom-making shoes for people with special feet. All can be easily solved. This strange man is already very young and is about to retire, so he has to order his shoes quickly, otherwise he will regret it if he misses the opportunity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For many years, if you want to buy shoes, you have to go to Japan to look for them. Maybe it’s because Japanese people often wear kimonos with flip-flops, so many people’s feet are not in the right shape; or maybe it’s because Japan’s national character is particularly careful. Thoughtful, anyway, if I want to find a decent pair of shoes that can fit on my feet, for me, Japan is the only place of origin. Due to the seriousness of the epidemic, I have not been able to go out for three or four years. My old shoes have been reimbursed and new shoes have not yet been obtained. When I heard that there is such a shoe-making wizard in Hong Kong, wouldn’t it make me excited and have to look for it? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The first time I came to make shoes was in mid-June. Finally, we found the reclusive master based on online information, and they actually connected via WhatsApp in a very modern way, and made an appointment to visit him on a Saturday morning. I called a taxi, drove around, walked a long way, arrived on time excitedly, walked into a completely unfamiliar factory building, stepped into a dirty and dilapidated elevator, rushed up to the high-rise building with great difficulty, and finally found the corresponding location. House number, why is the door locked and dark? I quickly called and contacted, and after a while, the other party finally answered, &quot;I&#39;m in the hospital! I injured my hand, and I&#39;m queuing up to see a doctor!&quot; Ah! Is this okay? Injured your hand while making shoes? Isn&#39;t this similar to a piano master suffering from tenosynovitis? This matter is no small matter! &quot;Ah! Take care of yourself! Your hands are the most important. When you are well, we will make an appointment again!&quot; On the phone, I was busy trying to comfort the person. Not only did I not blame the other person for breaking the appointment, I seemed to be full of apologies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After a while, we met again. When Liu Bei paid three visits to the thatched cottage, he invited Zhuge Kongming, a great genius, to help. In this world, good things are hard to come by. How can it be so easy to achieve a wish? So, with all the fuss, we embarked on the journey for the second time. This time, I finally saw the master himself. To be honest, some traditional local handicrafts are gradually declining, such as hand-made umbrellas, hand-carved sparrows, hand-painted ceramics, hand-made bird cages, etc. The old craftsmen who make cheongsams and are skilled in embroidery or paper-making are also gradually declining. Therefore, seeing a craftsman who has been working hard for decades and sticking to his traditional position makes me feel particularly kind and respectful. The master is thin and frail, with a sincere smile on his face. He talks incessantly, just like a familiar neighbor. He tells you all kinds of stories as soon as he opens his mouth, and how big and small the feet of so and so are. Oops, but once you put on his shoes, the problem is solved; so and so went to Europe to immigrate, and they have to rush back to find him to make shoes, etc. After talking for a long time, I finally remembered that I wanted to do business, so I pulled out a piece of A4 white paper with a snap, asked the visitor to take off his shoes and socks, put his feet on the white paper, and asked him to draw a paper pattern with a pen, and then Write the customer&#39;s name and phone number next to it, and the registration procedure is completed. At that time, I thought to myself, why is it so simple? I have been to many shoe-making shops, and I have to constantly use computers and instruments to measure the shape of my feet, and even make models before I can customize them. The finished products made with high technology are often not ideal! Is this old master’s home-made steel-making method feasible? However, once I saw his confident look and his sincere words, I had no choice but to suppress the doubts in my heart, &quot;It&#39;s okay to try! Maybe a miracle will happen?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Pay a deposit of five hundred first. , the shoes are ready, pay another thousand yuan!&quot; Do you have a receipt? He said no, so he hurriedly offered them all, thinking that for the old-school craftsmen, everything depends on trust, not written evidence. He added, &quot;Everything is clear and well-founded. You don&#39;t have to worry.&quot; When will the shoes be ready? &quot;I only have one pair of hands. I have to do it every day, and I have to take turns! At least for a month or two. Don&#39;t rush me.&quot; &quot;Okay, don&#39;t rush me if you don&#39;t.&quot; It seems that he does not have an assistant or an apprentice. You have to be considerate of other people’s hard work! &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I brought two pairs of Japanese shoes with me that day. They were trophies that I had purchased during my previous trip to Japan. Because the toe caps were too narrow, I had not worn them. I hope the master can help me with them this time. Making the toe of your shoes wider will be a great benefit. &quot;No problem, it&#39;s very easy!&quot; He agreed immediately. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Just like that, from June to October, I asked twice, and each time I was told that I was still in line. Finally, at the end of October, the shoes were actually ready! So I went there on a certain day, ready to receive the finished product. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I had no illusions and no hope, so when I put on my new shoes that day, a sharp pain hit me. I was not disappointed or resentful. This was to be expected! Of course, the master was not disappointed. He said confidently: &quot;It&#39;s like this. It&#39;s a little tight when I put it on. I&#39;ll do it for you. It&#39;ll be done soon.&quot; So he started to get busy. And me? I sat leisurely on the corridor, looking at the scenery on the hillside not far away, and started to enjoy it. I saw the windows of public houses hung with colorful clothes, commonly known as the Ten Thousand Flags. The green trees on the hillside were shaded, and the white clouds were floating in the blue sky. Suddenly, a group of white pigeons passed by in front of my eyes, and there was peace. It turns out that when waiting, choose to be optimistic. Being angry or calm only exists in a thought. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At this time, I remembered that there were still two pairs of Japanese shoes to be retrieved, and asked the master to get the shoes. He said: &quot;Ah! My memory is not good, I can&#39;t remember where I put them! What are the shoes?&quot; How does it look like?&quot; He asked, smiling innocently, with an innocent look on his face, which suddenly reminded me of the launch of the &quot;Brain Care&quot; program of CUHK by Kao Kun, which had to deal with the problem of memory degradation in the elderly. Have sympathy! Then, he said, why not let your Filipino maid go into the studio and look for it yourself? That place is really weird. It&#39;s more like a landfill than a studio. It&#39;s filled with all kinds of materials and tools, leaving only a narrow path that can be walked sideways. To find the target in it, it should be better than a lost city. Treasure hunting is even harder! The Filipino maid tried her best to go around in a circle but came back in vain. When she got to the door, she looked at me and the two of them couldn&#39;t help laughing! &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Here, the master took the trouble to adjust it again and again, and the shoes became looser every time. Every few minutes, I had to test it, standing up and sitting down. So on, after more than a dozen rounds, although the shoes and the foot shape have never reconciled, I think it is time to call it a day and call it a day. &quot;The leather of these shoes is very soft. If you wear them for a few more days, it won&#39;t hurt anymore.&quot; In your life, when buying and making shoes, have you never heard this kind of advice? I smiled, nodded quickly, paid the balance in a hurry, and prepared to go home. Suddenly, the master announced to me: &quot;If you find your Japanese shoes, I will send them to you by SF Express. You don&#39;t have to pay the ten yuan fee, I will pay it!&quot; He said it with great style, Very generous! &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the way back, I calculated in my mind that those two pairs of Japanese shoes cost me several thousand. Three visits to the thatched cottage, the fare plus the shoes cost another several thousand. If I add in the worries, wouldn’t it be Not even worth it? It is better to be happy and relieved. If one day I find the shoes, I will treat them as foreigners and be overjoyed.

The incident originated from the analysis video uploaded by the blogger &quot;Wheatfield Farmer&quot;. He used software to analyze the 12 song videos taken by fans at the Mayday Shanghai concert on November 16. After extracting the vocal analysis, he accused Mayday of &quot;in 12 songs. &quot;Five of the songs are lip-syncing,&quot; and another one is &quot;the first few lines are fake, but the rest are true.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the incident fermented, it triggered reactions from all parties. Some music bloggers said they had reported it to the China Consumers Association; the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Culture and Tourism said it would require the organizers to cooperate with the investigation; staff of the China Performance Industry Association said they had paid attention to the matter and were &quot;waiting for the results of the cultural law enforcement department.&quot; Mayday officials first posted on Weibo that they would broadcast the entire Paris concert live online, which was interpreted by the outside world as &quot;to dispel doubts.&quot; On December 4, their agency also issued a &quot;solemn statement&quot; stating that &quot;the tour will There is no lip-synching behavior in it.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to media reports, the audio and video materials of the Mayday Shanghai concert have been submitted to the local cultural market inspection department. The relevant departments will conduct scientific evaluation and analysis and publish the investigation results. Regardless of whether Mayday &quot;lip-synced&quot; this time, the old topic of &quot;lip-syncing&quot; has been thrown back into the public opinion field, which deserves further analysis. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First of all, this incident has brought new problems to &quot;how to define lip-synching&quot;, which requires industry research and follow-up. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to Article 31 of the &quot;Implementing Rules of the Commercial Performance Management Regulations&quot;, lip-synching &quot;refers to the act of actors using pre-recorded songs and music instead of live singing during the performance.&quot; In this incident, judging from the blogger&#39;s accusation, Mayday&#39;s suspected lip-synching was not the simple and crude &quot;pre-recording&quot; in the past, but the method of &quot;back-up singing&quot;: importing instrumental music and music into the concert project file in advance. For the vocal track, &quot;the lower part of the verse is really sung, and the chorus is sung in the background.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If &quot;undersinging&quot; is true, then the definition of &quot;lip-syncing&quot; will have a new question: Does &quot;singing the main song really, singing under the chorus&quot; count as lip-synching? In other words, what percentage of a song must be performed live for it to be considered lip-synching? Furthermore, today, when artificial intelligence has developed to the point where it is difficult to distinguish authenticity from fake, if the AI ​​training voice in the future is &quot;promoted and applied&quot;, how should the industry define and prevent it? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Regulations on the Administration of Commercial Performances&quot; stipulates that &quot;actors may not deceive the audience by lip-synching, and performance organizers shall not organize actors to lip-sync. No unit or individual may provide conditions for lip-synching.&quot; In fact, fake The turmoil caused by lip-synching did not start today. Similar incidents are common, and many singers have become the butt of jokes because of their genuine lip-synching. The reason is simple. Even without the constraints of the Commercial Performance Management Regulations, lip-syncing by entertainers will harm their social reputation. Lip-synching at a concert is unjustifiable in terms of professional ethics and legal responsibility. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since Mayday’s agency has issued a statement categorically denying lip-syncing and accusing the relevant remarks of “malicious attacks and rumors and slander”, one of the two statements must be false, and one party is destined to be suspected of violating relevant laws and regulations. This matter also deserves an authoritative investigation result. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, the &quot;Regulations on the Administration of Commercial Performances&quot; stipulates that &quot;the performance organizer should send a dedicated person to supervise the performance to prevent the occurrence of lip-synching behavior.&quot; According to a staff member of the Beijing Cultural Market Law Enforcement Corps, Mayday this year Law enforcement officers were on site to supervise the six concerts in Beijing. It is worth asking whether Mayday’s suspected lip-synching was only in Shanghai this time? At the previous six concerts in Beijing, did the on-site law enforcement officers fulfill their responsibilities of &quot;supervising the performances&quot; to prevent lip-synching? This should all be clarified in subsequent investigations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Secondly, this incident also raises a question: how to define and protect the consumer rights of commercial performance audiences. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If Mayday’s lip-synching is true, some viewers’ demands for “refund,” “compensation,” and “apology” should be supported. Of course, there are many viewers who &quot;don&#39;t care whether they actually sing or not&quot;, and there are also many fans who regard the concert as a ticket to a meet-and-greet. After the Mayday suspected lip-synching incident, some fans also said that &quot;just feel the atmosphere of the scene&quot;, &quot;just seeing them is enough&quot; and &quot;it doesn&#39;t matter whether they lip-sync or do the real thing.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is a famous saying in the legal world: &quot;struggle for rights.&quot; Any right needs to be asserted before it can be implemented. It is not difficult to imagine that there are people in the audience who are serious about lip-synching, and there are also people who don&#39;t care about lip-synching. There are people in the audience who have &quot;high standards and strict requirements&quot; for the viewing experience, and there are also people who bought tickets and came in just to have fun. In reality, &quot;concert audiences&quot; are not a homogeneous group, and their expectations for &quot;quality of goods and services&quot; are also different. However, since there are audiences claiming their rights in accordance with the law and regulations, the performers should respect their demands. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, there are a lot of lip-syncing in the European and American music circles. For example, in concerts later in his acting career, Michael Jackson would choose to lip-sync when singing and dancing some dance numbers due to physical reasons, but he The city will state in advance on its official website that the audiences who come for the &quot;moonwalk&quot; are not interested in whether they really sing or not; Pavarotti also lip-synched at the opening ceremony of the Turin Winter Olympics, but a generation of tenors can perform powerfully. He has won the admiration and respect of the world for showing up despite his illness. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the Chinese music scene, &quot;lowering expectations&quot; and &quot;advance notification&quot; are also widely used methods in the industry. For example, some singers lower the key or change the song in order to ensure the true singing effect. This is a frank admission of the voice. I can no longer really sing. In this case, it may be possible to respect the independent management rights of entertainers and require them to fulfill their obligation to inform, not to sell dogs on sheep&#39;s head, and let the market judge and consumers make their choices. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In short, in the face of the controversy over Mayday’s suspected lip-syncing, the industry must define “lip-syncing” more accurately, regulate commercial performances with more detailed legislation and law enforcement, and at the same time In accordance with the Consumer Rights and Interests Protection Act, we protect consumers’ rights to know the truth, make independent choices and fair transactions, and respect the legitimate rights and interests of consumers who come forward to question. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.run&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. run&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 05 Dec 2023 17:25:04 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
