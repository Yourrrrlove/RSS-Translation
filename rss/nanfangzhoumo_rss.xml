Southern Weekend reporters combined data from the websites of the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security and found that from 2013 to 2022, the number of secondary vocational schools continued to decrease, with a cumulative decrease of 2,911. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to data from the websites of the two ministries and commissions, the number of secondary vocational schools in China will be 9,752 in 2022, less than half of the peak in the 1990s. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporters found that the country’s adjustment of vocational education policies is the main reason for the decrease in the number of secondary vocational schools. In addition, the practical difficulties encountered in the development process of secondary vocational schools are also one of the reasons why various places have taken the initiative to merge and reduce schools. However, in recent years, with the changes in the layout of vocational education, secondary vocational schools have also ushered in new changes such as a substantial increase in the enrollment rate. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Public information shows that, combined with the predictions of scholars, in the next few years, the gradual reduction, dissolution, merger and optimization of secondary vocational schools will continue to be a trend. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Anhui Province has the largest decrease&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;An easily confused concept is that in China, secondary vocational education is divided into four categories, including general technical secondary schools, vocational High schools, adult secondary schools and technical schools. In accordance with the Vocational Education Law and the current &quot;three determinations&quot; (functional configuration, internal organization and staffing) plan of the State Council, vocational high schools, general technical secondary schools and adult technical secondary schools are under the management of the education department, and technical schools are under the management of the human resources and social security department. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It should be pointed out that the academic qualifications obtained after graduation from general technical secondary schools, vocational high schools, adult technical secondary schools and technical schools are all secondary education qualifications. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Data from the Ministry of Education website shows that in 2013, the number of secondary vocational schools nationwide was 12,300. By 2022, this number dropped to 7,201. In the past ten years, the number of secondary vocational schools has decreased by 5,100 overall. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A closer look at the year-by-year data on the Ministry of Education’s website will reveal that from 2013 to 2020, the number of secondary vocational schools decreased each year by between 151 and 676. In 2021, the number of secondary vocational schools decreased by 2,602 compared with 2020, and there were obvious abnormalities in the range of data changes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this regard, a note on the official website of the Ministry of Education shows that the statistics of secondary vocational colleges in 2021 and 2022 do not include technical schools managed by the human resources and social security departments. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporters checked the official website of the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security and found that including data from 2021 and 2022, the number of technical schools increased by 69 and 59 respectively. Combined with the decrease in the number of secondary vocational schools in the country from 2013 to 2022 compared with the previous year, the data shows that from 2013 to 2022, the number of secondary vocational schools nationwide decreased by 2,911 in ten years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, Southern Weekend reporters inquired about the official data released by the education departments and statistics departments of 31 provinces (autonomous regions and municipalities) across the country from 2012 to 2022. Whether each province (autonomous region and municipality) plans to collect data The standards for entering technical schools are not uniform. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, looking at the overall situation, nationwide, except for the Tibet Autonomous Region, which has a slight increase in the number of secondary vocational colleges (an increase of 7) on the original basis, the remaining provinces (autonomous regions and municipalities) are all. downward trend. The number of secondary vocational schools in Anhui Province has decreased the most, with a decrease of 216 in ten years, a decrease of approximately 44%. Henan Province followed, with a decrease of 198. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past ten years, the number of universities has decreased by more than 100 in 10 provinces. Except for Heilongjiang, Shandong, Guangdong, and Zhejiang, the rest are all in the central and western regions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In comparison, Qinghai, Ningxia and other places have experienced single-digit declines over the past ten years due to factors such as insufficient construction of secondary vocational schools, and the change is not significant. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/19/PxVW6rlgSziSm5VvI9A2ssWYVIZh23jljWzDL0bU.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1155&quot; height= &quot;780&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/19/PxVW6rlgSziSm5VvI9A2ssWYVIZh23jljWzDL0bU.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254656&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On June 25, 2022, in a clothing production company in Tongren, Guizhou, students majoring in clothing design at the Yuping Dong Autonomous County Secondary Vocational School were processing clothing. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Policy adjustment is the main reason&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Secondary vocational school It once played an important role in China&#39;s economic development. Its number experienced explosive growth in the late 1980s, from 2,760 in 1978 to more than 20,000 in 1990, an increase of nearly eight times. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, by the end of the 20th century, with the combined effects of multiple factors such as industrial restructuring, tightening of the employment environment, and expansion of college enrollment, the development of secondary vocational education gradually declined because it was difficult to adapt to the needs of the market and employers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Official data shows that since 1999, the number of secondary vocational schools has been declining year by year, with only a slight increase between 2004 and 2008. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During this period, in 2007, the Ministry of Education issued the &quot;Notice on Further Improving the Enrollment Management of Various Types of Colleges and Universities&quot;, which stipulated that the corresponding enrollment plan for colleges and universities to recruit secondary vocational graduates should not exceed the number of fresh graduates of secondary vocational schools that year. 5% of students. This proportion limit actually clarifies the employment orientation of secondary vocational education. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The main reason for the decrease in the number of secondary vocational schools is the adjustment of national policies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2014 and 2019, the State Council issued the &quot;Decision on Accelerating the Development of Modern Vocational Education&quot; (hereinafter referred to as the &quot;Decision&quot;) and the &quot;Notice on Issuing the National Vocational Education Reform Implementation Plan&quot; respectively. It is proposed to “encourage high-quality schools to integrate school resources and optimize the layout and structure of secondary vocational education through mergers, trusteeships, cooperative education, etc.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the &quot;Decision&quot; was promulgated, the Beijing Municipal Education Commission announced the corresponding implementation opinions of Beijing, requiring the number of secondary vocational schools in the city to be adjusted from 116 to about 60, a reduction of nearly half. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Henan started optimizing the layout of secondary vocational schools in 2015, and integrated a number of &quot;weak, small and scattered&quot; schools in the form of cancellation, merger, and transfer. Jiangxi also introduced a new policy for secondary vocational education in 2015, proposing to merge more than 200 secondary vocational schools within three years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Also in 2015, Guangxi proposed that &quot;by 2020, the number of secondary vocational schools in the region will be adjusted from the current 333 to about 240.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In September 2020, nine departments including the Ministry of Education jointly issued the &quot;Action Plan for Improving the Quality of Vocational Education (2020-2023)&quot; (hereinafter referred to as the &quot;Plan&quot;). Based on the original policy It is further proposed to &quot;comprehensively verify the basic conditions for running secondary vocational schools, integrate &#39;empty, small, scattered and weak&#39; schools, and optimize the layout of secondary vocational schools.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to the adjustment of national policies, the difficulties encountered by secondary vocational schools in their own development are also one of the reasons for the reduction in the number of schools. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, before the state promulgated relevant policies, local governments had already taken measures to reduce the number of secondary vocational schools, which directly pointed to practical problems in the development of secondary vocational education. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As early as the beginning of the 21st century, in order to meet the needs of Beijing’s urban function adjustment and industrial structure upgrading, the Beijing Municipal Education Commission merged a number of small-scale, low-efficiency schools with unclear professional characteristics. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“This is not a bad thing. Only by merging schools with poor quality and low enrollment can we improve the quality and attractiveness of secondary vocational colleges.” Vice Chairman of China Development Research Foundation Fang Jin, the secretary-general, once said publicly. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;The transformation of secondary vocational schools pays more attention to quality&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;“The decrease in the number of secondary vocational colleges has a certain relationship with the transformation of secondary vocational education, because the government may China pays more attention to quality rather than quantity.&quot; Xu Hui, a doctoral candidate in sociology at the University of Jena in Germany and a researcher at the Sino-German Research Center for Skills and Social Development, told Southern Weekend reporters that this reduction in quantity may help concentrate resources and improve the quality of education. , to meet today’s ever-changing professional needs. According to Xu Hui’s observation, under the transformation, secondary vocational education has greatly improved in terms of curriculum diversity, technology upgrading, and career guidance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The ensuing increase in attractiveness is also the result of policy changes. One of the key points is the substantial increase in the enrollment rate. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;PhD candidate Jiang Beijia and scientific research assistant Fan Yilin of the National Education Macro Policy Research Institute of East China Normal University published a paper &quot;Policy Changes in Vocational Education for Higher Education: Context, Logic and &quot;Mirror&quot;, sorted out relevant policy documents and found that since the &quot;National Medium and Long-term Education Reform and Development Plan (2010-2020)&quot; issued in 2010, it was first proposed to separate the enrollment of higher vocational examinations from the general college entrance examination. The &quot;National Vocational Education Reform Implementation Plan&quot; clearly states for the first time that &quot;the establishment of a vocational education college entrance examination system&quot; will be completely liberated from the previously restricted enrollment rate in secondary vocational schools. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At present, the main channels for secondary vocational school graduates to obtain undergraduate degrees include consistent training, vocational education college entrance examination, junior college to bachelor&#39;s degree, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The smooth flow of channels for further education has led to an increase in the admission rate of secondary vocational schools. Data released by education departments in many places show that the enrollment rate of secondary vocational schools in recent years has generally exceeded 80%. Taking Shenzhen, which has developed secondary vocational education, as an example, the &quot;Shenzhen Secondary Vocational Education Quality Report 2023&quot; shows that in 2022, the number of graduates from Shenzhen&#39;s secondary vocational schools will be 12,485, and the number of students entering higher education will be 11,173, with the enrollment rate reaching 89.49%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, Xu Hui also pointed out that a high secondary vocational education promotion rate can provide students with more opportunities, but a careful balance is also needed to ensure that the quality and resources of secondary vocational education are not ignored. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In February 2022, at a press conference held by the Ministry of Education to introduce the work related to promoting the high-quality development of modern vocational education, Chen Ziji, Director of the Department of Vocational Education and Adult Education of the Ministry of Education, further explained that optimizing the quality of secondary vocational education The layout structure is mainly achieved through measures such as cancellation, merger, transformation, trusteeship, land replacement, and group school running. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This means that in the future, the number of secondary vocational schools nationwide may continue to decrease. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 20 Oct 2023 13:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[女童被狗咬伤事件中，伤人的罗威纳是种什么犬？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258939]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-20 12:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 20 Oct 2023 12:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[普通人上播客讲故事：声波起伏间，听见人生一段]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258802]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-20 11:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;46-year-old excavator Wang Chunyan told her life story through a podcast. This time, her voice arrived In the ears of tens of thousands of people. On the construction site where the machines are roaring, she is silent most of the time. When faced with the foreman&#39;s scolding, she just pretends not to hear it and sometimes has to smile. With only one square meter in the cab, she would listen to her favorite music and sing loudly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/DNEXw9iOruxL22YwlzaDlFPOCgz64j52FhUkjWP6.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/DNEXw9iOruxL22YwlzaDlFPOCgz64j52FhUkjWP6.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254358&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Women are in the minority among those who operate excavators. As one of them, Wang Chunyan’s experience is special. The picture shows the scene of drying chili peppers in Jiuquan, Gansu Province in September 2023. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the collection of stories on the theme of &quot;My achievements have nothing to do with gender&quot; was issued, Kou Aizhe received a large number of submissions , he was first attracted by Wang Chunyan’s message, although she only briefly expressed that as a woman, “the excavator makes me very proud.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xiaoye, who is studying for graduate school in France, entered the podcast process as a narrator, which was full of drama. She learned that her father, whom she had not seen for many years, passed away in Cambodia. She wanted to go there, but she did not dare to leave rashly. She happened to find a podcast episode in which a Chinese man in Cambodia, Santiao, told his story about a foreign country. She finally contacted him through a message. With care, Xiaoye completed the &quot;journey to find his father&quot; with peace of mind, and later accepted the invitation to participate in the podcast recording with this story. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On Xiaoyushu App, Xiaoye’s story has become one of the three most popular programs among all podcasts. This kind of spread effect was expected by the host Da Meng. What he didn’t expect was that as a Content workers can help some people solve real-life problems while making programs. This is the biggest healing and encouragement Xiaoye&#39;s story brings to him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Song Xinran listened to his podcast outside the massage parlor where he worked. He was embarrassed to listen in front of his colleagues and felt that his voice was unpleasant. When he told his story, there was something &quot;very hard to explain&quot;. He is a blind marathon runner. In the show, he said: &quot;As long as you run, you can create the wind.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Kou Aizhe and Dameng are the owners of two podcasts - Story FM and Genius respectively. Founder and anchor of Catcher FM. Story FM passed its seventh birthday, and Genius Catcher FM was born at the end of 2019. The former&#39;s guest self-narration format has become a signature, while the latter uses interviews to capture the inspiration of all kinds of life. The content narrators of podcasts are often industry experts, scholars, and media people, and these two podcasts provide a stage for lay people to talk and express themselves, and amplify their voices. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/djz1BWwVeyn3H4uCHyx0M6YiDijOez8Jk340CNkQ.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height= &quot;683&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/djz1BWwVeyn3H4uCHyx0M6YiDijOez8Jk340CNkQ.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254360&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;There are currently relatively few Chinese podcasts where amateurs tell stories. The picture is a creative picture. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;They host almost the only large-scale witness story podcast in China. Dameng saw that the podcast platform classified the two into the story category, which is not a problem in itself. What is strange is that other podcasts in the same category tell ghost stories and historical stories. &quot;They are not the same &#39;storytelling&#39;.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;From listener to narrator&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Wang Chunyan had been listening to Story FM for five years before she opened her mouth to tell the story. At first, she was attracted by the eye-catching title of Story FM, but gradually she felt that it suited her very well, as it was an &quot;unconcealed, spiritual communication program that directly faces people&#39;s hearts.&quot; She is particularly interested in stories involving life, death and human emotions, and is keenly aware that the program &quot;focuses on more vulnerable groups.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When she saw Story FM’s call for submissions to collect stories about women in gender-imbalanced industries, Wang Chunyan had a lot to say. &quot;As a female excavator master, I don&#39;t know if I have a firm foothold, but I have persisted for more than ten years and I feel quite proud.&quot; She left a message, &quot;I didn&#39;t expect Ai Zhe to really see it.&quot;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;When the epidemic broke out, Xiaoye developed the habit of listening to podcasts. She described that she had some obsessive-compulsive disorder at the time. After discovering Genius Catcher FM, she listened to every program from the beginning. Xiaoye, who already likes to listen to different life stories, is like finding a treasure. He keeps listening to it until now. The program invited many people from all walks of life to tell their career stories. She was deeply impressed by the psychiatrist Chen Baiyou among them, because what she told was very touching and different from the public perception. &quot;She said that only kind people will suffer from mental illness, which touched me very much.&quot; Xiaoye told Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xiaoye’s parents went to Cambodia to work together. She was also born in Cambodia. After her parents divorced, her mother took Xiaoye back to China to develop, while her father stayed in Cambodia. In June 2022, Xiaoye learned about her father&#39;s death through relatives. On Father&#39;s Day a week later, she sent her blessings to her father&#39;s WeChat, but she did not expect a response from the other party. A strange Cambodian woman contacted Xiaoye and claimed to be her father&#39;s partner. Later, she invited Xiaoye to Phnom Penh to participate in her father&#39;s 100-day festival. When she was hesitating whether to go there, she happened to see Genius Catcher FM&#39;s push &quot;I collected corpses for Chinese people in Cambodia, but I didn&#39;t dare to show the faces of the corpses to their families.&quot; She left messages for Dameng on various platforms, hoping to get to know the narrator, Santiao, and Dameng set up a connection between the two. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sanjou said to Xiaoye: &quot;Just come, I will pick you up at the airport.&quot; As soon as she left the airport gate, Xiaoye saw the woman holding a photo of her father, but she always felt that she would just go with this stranger , feeling panicked. At this time, Sanjou appeared. He grabbed Xiaoye&#39;s suitcase and protected her from behind. On the first day of Xiaoye&#39;s arrival, Sanjou drove with him all the way, and even called his girlfriend, who could speak English and Cambodian, to act as a translator for Xiaoye. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xiaoye bought an urn at the local market and took away part of his father&#39;s ashes. Among his father&#39;s belongings, there was a small box containing several photos with Xiaoye. Xiaoye also discovered that although he had not seen his father since his second year in junior high school, his passport still had records of entering China several times. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After Xiaoye returned to daily life, Dameng chatted with her for an hour or two and recorded this life experience. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;His father was absent when Xiaoye was growing up. Whether it was on the phone or via WeChat, Xiaoye felt that he could not truly communicate with each other. But within just two or three days of staying in a foreign land, Xiaoye realized that his father had been thinking about him. From a group of strange Cambodian people, she heard her relatives call her: baby, with an exaggerated pronunciation and mouth shape, which was unique to her father. She thought about how many times her father had to say it before everyone around him remembered it. Some listeners shed tears after hearing this detail. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/N6yoBn0rYEuKFsOCqtCknUHP4Y8clT3ww87UIy03.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/N6yoBn0rYEuKFsOCqtCknUHP4Y8clT3ww87UIy03.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254359&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The stories of the Chinese in Cambodia have been made into a series of podcasts, including the story of Xiaoye going to participate in his father&#39;s 100-day festival. The picture shows the Day of the Dead in Phnom Penh, Cambodia in October 2023. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Chunyan has been driving excavators for more than ten years. When she talked about taking hormones to gain weight in order to collect bills more easily and avoid being sexually harassed, Kou Aizhe was shocked and confirmed again, did you really take hormones to gain weight? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are many inconveniences for women working as excavators, such as the lack of toilets at the construction site. For this reason, Wang Chunyan would leave home at around 5 a.m. and get off work at around 8 p.m. without taking a sip of water. Sometimes she couldn&#39;t hold it in any longer, so she would dig a hole for emergencies. Not many people can persist. Wang Chunyan has built a &quot;National Queen Group&quot;, which has 99 female excavator operators, roughly 1/3 of which have mature skills. She has accepted three female apprentices, and they either changed careers or started working on their own. When you are the boss, you no longer do it yourself. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Chunyan persisted mainly to make money. Doing other jobs cannot support this family. When she was 16 years old, her abducted sister returned home nine months pregnant. Both her mother and sister suffer from mental illness, and her father-in-law is careless. The family&#39;s livelihood depends entirely on Wang Chunyan. Later, her husband was in a car accident and became a vegetative state. After he woke up and was discharged from the hospital paralyzed, he owed a large amount of medical expenses, which Wang Chunyan has been paying over the years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;More than two months after the podcast was released, many listeners left messages and were moved by her tenacity, courage, and optimism. Wang Chunyan didn&#39;t pay much attention to this feedback. She was working every day in the past few days and &quot;didn&#39;t stop to review those things.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Speak out your worries and hear new knowledge&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Wang Chunyan has never told her family about the hardships she experienced outside. Her sister, mother, and husband are all patients. Her parents-in-law have never wanted to see her because of her family background. She, there was almost no emotional communication between the two parties. &quot;I don&#39;t have an outlet to vent. Sometimes I feel very depressed and want a space to talk.&quot; Talking about her life in the podcast fulfilled her wish to talk. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Kou Aizhe understands this mentality very well, “Everyone needs to tell something that has been buried in his heart for a long time, or some obstacles that he cannot get over, or he is confused about this matter and wants to hear some people’s opinions. Feedback, but he may not want people around him to hear it, for example, he cannot accept these people judging him.&quot; Some of the more secretive stories are basically from the narrator&#39;s initiative. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During the interview, if the narrator states that he does not want certain details to be disclosed, such as name, city, and industry, they will be blurred. This protection of anonymity also gives the narrator more courage. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;It&#39;s anonymous anyway, no one knows who I am, so I can say whatever I want.&quot; Xiaoye received Da Meng&#39;s recording invitation and readily agreed. She was very happy to be on the podcast she often listens to. , at the same time, she felt that this story was &quot;quite bizarre, outrageous, and worth telling&quot; and wanted to share it with more people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Dameng’s view, recording a podcast is a process in which the narrator and the producer complement each other. &quot;Sometimes people experience some legendary things and want to record them. Some people are willing to write and some are willing to talk about it. It is also important for the guests to record their own experiences on our program. Let me help them complete it. Content editor.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Because everyone&#39;s life is boring and they are curious about what other people live, so they especially like to listen to such stories. For me, this is a way to see the world. The window is mainly for fun.&quot; Xiaoye explained why people love to listen to stories told by another ordinary person so much. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For producers, the fun of doing programs is largely due to the ability to gain new knowledge and broaden their cognitive boundaries. When I first started doing a series of stories about Cambodian characters, almost every issue would refresh Da Meng’s understanding. The narrators all live in Phnom Penh and Sihanoukville, Cambodia, helping Chinese people in trouble in foreign lands. Santiao was the first one to share on the show. He volunteered to help Chinese people who died accidentally in Cambodia, process and cremate their bodies, and transport them back to China. Later, Dameng interviewed Jie Ge and Aaron one after another. They used their own methods to protect the Chinese wandering in Cambodia or guide them on their way home. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Beijing Long Distance Running Festival in April 2023 made Dameng pay attention to He Yajun’s Blind Assistance Group. After contacting several blind runners in the group, he chose Song Xinran as the subject of his story. The theme of the program is about &quot;wind&quot;. Every Wednesday and Saturday morning, Song Xinran runs with nearly a hundred teammates in the Beijing Olympic Forest Park, passing through flowers, bamboo forests, and ponds. The blind friend and the running aid volunteer are connected by a running aid rope for the blind. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/v5xWL54vReWbjIi8ol9nJ4E7jtFpQz3b2eNNqLOk.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;639&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/v5xWL54vReWbjIi8ol9nJ4E7jtFpQz3b2eNNqLOk.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254357&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Song Xinran, a blind man, talked about his experience in long-distance running. The picture shows a blind running rope connecting a blind marathon runner (left) and a volunteer guiding him (right) in Tai&#39;an, Shandong in 2017. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The competition that Song Xinran is most proud of is the 2019 Beijing Long Distance Running Festival. He ran hard and ran within the prescribed time. He crossed the finish line and won the qualification for his runner to pass through to the &quot;Northern Marathon&quot; competition. Running has become an indispensable part of Song Xinran&#39;s life. The customers who come for massage are also infected by him and start practicing running. Sometimes when talking about pace, they praise it, it’s so fast. You have bad eyesight and you can run faster than us. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Story FM has also invited some blind narrators. Although everyone has their own interests and hobbies, when it comes to employment, most of them can only go for massages. In a later episode, a group of blind employees from Xiaomi in Shanghai were invited to talk about how they worked as markers and trained the AI ​​Xiao Ai classmates. A blind listener in Xi&#39;an listened to the program and kept sending messages to Kou Aizhe, telling him how the program inspired him. Kou Aizhe witnessed his changes little by little. The latest news was that he came to report good news: Xiaomi was recruiting blind people to do similar work in Xi&#39;an, and he successfully applied. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Listening to strangers’ stories sometimes has such a direct impact on the audience that they respond in their own lives. As the popularity of the program increased, Dameng discovered that many listeners regarded Genius Catcher FM as a career guide. A program by a space organizer inspired several listeners to start engaging in related work. A person passed the police civil service examination and sent a private message saying that he was not a police major. After listening to the program, he yearned for the honor and experience of this profession and had a belief. I was so moved and frightened that I turned on the program and listened to it again, &quot;Don&#39;t say anything nonsense.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Let different people &quot;penetrate each other&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Xiaoye likes to listen to podcasts in the shower and while commuting. Chatting podcasts rank first in her mind. “They are the kind where the host is chatting, and you listen and feel like you can join in, so you can’t help but join in the discussion.” One time while commuting, she heard something funny and stopped to stamp her feet on the street and burst into laughter. Life seemed to have a different color because her ears were plugged and she couldn&#39;t hear the sounds outside. At that moment, she felt happy and contented, &quot;This is my world.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When operating an excavator, if the construction site is large enough, has a good view, and the work is not too tight, Wang Chunyan will turn on the stereo and listen to something. Only in the one-square-meter cab of the excavator can she have some time of her own. The rest of the time belongs to others. &quot;Coming home is like fighting a war.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Chunyan also plays Douyin. Among the bloggers she follows, there are many ideological ones, but she believes that &quot;Douyin is just a kind of fast food, and the real nutritious meal is podcasts.&quot; Podcasts arouse her deep understanding. There is more to think about than short videos. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A podcast episode is usually tens of minutes long, or even as long as two or three hours. Unlike short videos and other content, Dameng pointed out that the main value that podcasts, long-form content that focuses on reality, can bring to listeners is &quot;companionship and recognition.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He interviewed the founders of transgender groups, social workers who helped female domestic workers, and niche professional or hobby groups, trying to reflect the situation of a group of people through their narration of their fate and experiences, and make many people who originally felt People who are very lonely are no longer so lonely. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In podcasts where amateurs tell stories, the narrator’s expressive ability is not that important. Dameng believes that the value of stories to people, the scarcity of information, and the desire of guests to share are all more important than the ability to express themselves. Kou Aizhe bluntly said that the so-called ability to express well is actually a privilege. What Story FM wants to do is to break it rather than strengthen it. &quot;Those who are not so eloquent in expression have very good stories and very good experiences, but they It is a pity to remain silent.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Kou Aizhe interviewed a contributor, a female worker on the assembly line. For many years, she tried to take her children with her and live with her in the city, but she encountered obstacles everywhere. Later, she also tried to return to her hometown. Find a job, but there are no good jobs in my hometown to support my family and give my children a better life. Although her education level is not high and her expression is simple and unpretentious, she resonates with many parents from middle-class families in first-tier cities. Parents&#39; love and devotion to their children and the struggles in raising children are common. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“I don’t want people to use a certain label to evaluate a person. This may be what my story wants to show.” Kou Aizhe wants to use the podcast to let people of different classes or classes People &quot;penetrate each other&quot;, understand what their respective lives are like, and have a better understanding. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Chunyan once listened to the program &quot;Behind the 50 million blind date game, do billionaires still believe in love&quot; with curiosity. She concluded, &quot;The basic characteristics of us as a person are sincerity and sincerity, whether he is a multi-millionaire or an ordinary citizen. &lt;span>;&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt; p>; &quot;Whether it is a short video, or some short posts, pictures and texts, we will soon get a conclusion, but in the podcast, we can follow the people who have experienced it and retrace this person&#39;s growth and experience. , you will find that there is complexity behind everything and everyone.&quot; Dameng told Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;Just see this side of me&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Song Xinran&#39;s podcast was forwarded to the running group by the captain. His teammates praised him and told stories that were very true. I hope he will do it again in the future. I can hear the story told by him himself. He also mentioned in the podcast how he and his girlfriend met and fell in love. The two trained together in a running group and gradually developed a relationship. On the day he confessed his love, he hugged his girlfriend. Someone in the group heard it and teased, &quot;Young people today are so courageous. We didn&#39;t dare to do that back then.&quot; After listening to the show, his girlfriend also blamed Song Xinran for &quot;talking about the two of them&quot; So straightforward.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xiaoye listened to that episode of her show to her friends. Several friends she was not familiar with sent her long essays on WeChat. The central idea was comfort and praise, &quot;You did a really good job with me.&quot; Goodbye&quot;. Xiaoye likes to ask friends who have listened to it, did you cry &lt;span>;? &lt;/span>;When the other party said he was crying, Xiaoye thought, &quot;Okay, I feel like I have earned something.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Chunyan is very low-key about recording podcasts, and her daughter is the only one she shares with. During the three years when Wang Chunyan accompanied her husband to the hospital in Zhejiang, her daughter was sent back to her hometown in Hubei. When she was in elementary school, she was bullied on campus and suffered from depression. She has always been rebellious and rarely communicated with her parents. Wang Chunyan didn&#39;t know how her daughter felt specifically after hearing this, because she didn&#39;t say anything and didn&#39;t contact him until a day later. But from then on, her daughter became willing to chat with Wang Chunyan and became more concerned about her. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the trip to Cambodia, Xiaoye said nothing to his relatives, including his mother, and naturally did not let them know about the podcast he had recorded. Father is a topic that Xiaoye and her mother tacitly avoid talking about. Xiaoye also doesn’t want her mother to know that she went to Cambodia: “On the one hand, because she is a bit controlling, I still act like a more obedient daughter most of the time. , I will try my best to listen to her opinion on such a big matter. She told me very seriously before that she didn’t want me to go, but out of my own stubbornness, I went anyway. And I didn’t really want her to know that she was There is another lady in Cambodia who lives with my dad, and I don’t want her to be away from my dad for so long and have to think about my dad’s affairs.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, Xiaoye also hopes that her mother will find out about this. Maybe the two of them will be more open to talking about it. Xiaoye decided not to tell her proactively, and recording the podcast was like burying a clue. Maybe she would find it, and maybe it would become a secret forever. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Story FM invites producers to conduct a &quot;year-end summary&quot; in 2022. One of the producers mentioned that when he was producing a program, he was so moved by a confession from the interviewee that he thought of ending the program with this paragraph. However, the interviewee then asked: &quot;How is it? I So it can arouse the audience&#39;s emotions, right?&quot; The producer suddenly realized that even interviews that pursue documentary often only enlarge the fragments of a person&#39;s life, so he wanted to remind the audience: don&#39;t care so much. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the first few days after the show aired, Xiaoye paid attention to the comments. When she saw someone saying that they really wanted to follow Xiaoye&#39;s Weibo, she thought to herself, please don&#39;t. &quot;When you listen to my story, this is one side of me, but if you really pay attention to my life, it&#39;s the other side. People are multi-faceted. Just see this side of me. I don&#39;t want to show it in all directions. I don’t like it in front of the public.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The podcast condenses a small part of their life memories, and the real life continues, which is far more complicated than the story being told. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Chunyan said in the program that she made a wish in front of Bodhisattva at that time. If her husband wakes up, she is willing to give him half of his life span and only live to 50 years old. She will reach this age in a few years, and she hopes to travel and live a life for herself. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In reality, Wang Chunyan, in addition to her passion and bravery, also has a level of sobriety and coldness that has been polished by her circumstances. She believes, &quot;I have seen too many things in the world, and it is of no use to live so much. Living to 50 years old is enough.&quot; When she went to the mental hospital to visit her sister, she no longer recognized her, and she needed others to hand her water and food before she could eat. She thought, in that state, what role did maintaining her sister&#39;s life play? It was just to make herself, a relative, feel at ease. She has read &quot;Dream of Red Mansions&quot; countless times, and is no stranger to the illusion of life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the end of the interview, she suddenly asked the Southern Weekend reporter whether bone marrow donation (commonly known as hematopoietic stem cell donation) would have any impact on the donor&#39;s health. She had applied for a voluntary donation of hematopoietic stem cells, and recently had an initial meeting with a patient. The match was successful, but my daughter disagreed. If it doesn&#39;t affect her work, she still hopes to contribute: &quot;A life is waiting, and it would be too cruel not to save it.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: 毷体, 毷体_GB2312 , STKaiti;&quot;>;(Xiaoye and Santiao are pseudonyms in the article)&lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;&lt;span>;高质量建设国家公园，是我国生态文明制度建设的重要内容，对于推进自然资源科学保护和合理利用，促进人与自然和谐共生，推进美丽中国建设，具有极其重要的意义。近年来，人民法院始终坚持以习近平新时代中国特色社会主义思想为指导，深入践行习近平法治思想、习近平生态文明思想，深入贯彻落实能动司法理念，坚持为大局服务、为人民司法，依法妥善审理涉及国家公园的环境污染防治、生态保护修复、&lt;/span>;资源开发利用等各类环境资源案件，努力推动我国国家公园高水平保护高质量发展。为加强国家公园法治宣传，培养国家公园文化，传播国家公园理念，彰显人民法院保护国家公园取得的成效，最高人民法院发布系列国家公园司法保护典型案例。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;本次发布十件典型案例，具有以下亮点。一是涉及诉讼种类多、保护范围广。本批典型案例包括环境资源刑事、民事及公益诉讼等不同诉讼类型，涵盖了环境资源审判领域的主要范围；涉及的国家公园既有三江源、大&lt;span>;熊猫、东北虎豹、海南热带雨林、武夷山等五个首批设立的国家公园，还有列入《国家公园空间布局方案》遴选的国家公园候选区的钱江源-&lt;/span>;百山祖国家公园，体现了人民法院审理涉国家公园保护的案件诉讼种类多、保护国家公园范围广的特点。二是坚持能动司法。案例五王某民等六人滥伐林木、危害国家重点保护植物刑事附带民事公益诉讼案，及案例九张某彦、张某怡诉洋县林业局生命权纠纷案，人民法院对于审判中发现的国家公园管理方面的漏洞短板，没有机械司法、一判了之，而是积极延伸环境资源审判职能，主动融入生态文明建设进程，向行政主管部门发出司法建议，督促有关部门查漏补缺，是能动司法的生动实践。三是坚持一体化保护、系统治理理念。案例三杨某等三人污染环境案，体现了人民法院加强对大熊猫国家公园毗邻区域环境污染行为的治理；案例四李某华等十一人危害珍贵、濒危野生动物刑事附带民事公益诉讼案，人民法院对危害珍贵、濒危野生动物犯罪的“猎捕-收购-运输-销售”环节进行全链条打击，是一体化保护、系统治理的生动实践。四是坚持最严法治原则。案例一&lt;span>;郑某成、高某进、叶某东非法采矿案，对于非法开采国家战略性资源的行为，在法定刑幅度范围内从严处罚，并严格控制缓刑的适用，用司法利剑保障国家战略性资源的开发利用。案例七海南省人民检察院第一分院诉李某清、叶某青生态破坏民事公益诉讼案，在行为人已被另案判处刑事责任的同时，严肃追究其民事赔偿责任，体现了损害担责、最严法治的原则。案例八浙江省开化县人民检察院诉陆某燕等四人生态破坏民事公益诉讼案，对于通过录制宰杀视频验货、网络支付、邮寄交货等方式非法收购、出售野生动物行为，依法严肃惩处，彰&lt;/span>;显了以最严格制度最严密法治保护国家公园生态环境的态度。五是坚持预防性司法。案例四李某华等十一人危害珍贵、濒危野生动物刑事附带民事公益诉讼案，对于动物园经营者的犯罪人，为预防其利用从事野生动物收购、饲养、出售、运输等便利条件再实施此类犯罪，人民法院对其判处“禁止令”，体现了预防性司法理念。六是妥善处理民生、发展和保护的关系。案例二张某强非法制造枪支、非法狩猎案，对于刚刚脱贫的当地村民适用缓刑，避免刚&lt;span>;脱贫的家庭因刑返贫，较好平衡了生态环境保护和民生保障之间的关系。案例六李某良、羊某理失火、羊某理非法狩猎刑事附带民事公益诉讼案，考虑到被告经济困难，准许其通过劳务代偿的方式履行异地生态修复义务，体现了司法对民生保障的关切。案例九张某彦、张某怡诉洋县林业局生命权纠纷案，依照野生动物保护法有关规定，对野生动物造成伤亡人员的家属请求有关部门给付补偿金的诉讼请求予以支持，体现了兼顾野生动物保护与维护人民生命财产安全的双重目标。案例十青海某水电开发公司破产重整案，充分发挥审判职能作用，加强与政府相关部门的协调，促成案涉水电站全面复工，有效化解了企业破产纠纷，妥善处理了社会经济发展和生态环境保护的关系。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;这十件国家公园司法保护典型案件的依法妥善审理，充分展现了人民法院发挥生态环境资源审判职能、依法保护国家公园自然生态系统的完整性和原真性、给子孙后代留下珍贵自然资产的责任担当，对维护国家生态安全，保护生物多样性，推动国家公园高水平保护高质量发展具有积极意义。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;span>;&lt;strong>;国家公园司法保护典型案例&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/h4>;

&lt;p>;&lt;span>;【基本案情】&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;被告人郑某成与他人共同承包位于福建省光泽县鸾凤乡某山场的林地，该山场位于武夷山国家公园范围内。郑某成与被告人高某进系朋友关系，二人预谋在该山场合伙开采稀土牟利。 2016年9月至2017年5月期间，郑某成、高某进组织冯某安、钟某明（均另案处理）和被告人叶某东等人在无采矿许可证的情况下，到该山场采用在山体打溶洞注入硫酸铵等，再对析出液体进行沉淀的方式开采稀土矿，现场查获疑似稀土半成品9300千克。经鉴定，案涉稀土矿均属离子吸附型稀土，属国家规定实行保护性开采的特定矿种，郑某成等人非法开采行为还造成稀土矿点矿产资源破坏。此外，另查明叶某东于2018年3月与他人因琐事争执并打斗，犯有故意伤害致人轻伤的犯罪事实。福建省光泽县以郑某成、高某进、叶某东犯非法采矿罪，叶某东犯故意伤害罪提起公诉。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;【裁判结果】&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;福建省光泽县人民法院经审理认为，被告人郑某成、高某进、叶某东等人违反矿产资源法的规定，无采矿许可证擅自开采国家实行保护性开采的特定矿种离子吸附型稀土矿，情节特别严重，已构成非法采矿罪。郑某成、高某进是主犯，叶某东是从犯。遂以非法采矿罪分别判处郑某成、高某进有期徒刑四年九个月，并处罚金15万元；以非法采矿罪、故意伤害罪，数罪并罚，判处叶某东有期徒刑三年，并处罚金10万元；扣押在案的稀土半成品予以没收。宣判后，被告人高某进不服，提出上诉。福建省南平市中级人民法院二审裁定：驳回上诉，维持原判。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;【典型意义】&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;武夷山国家公园是我国目前唯一一个既是世界人与生物圈保护区，又是世界文化与自然双遗产的国家公园，储有众多不可再生的宝贵矿产资源。其中的稀土是我国的重要战略资源，是新兴产业、高端制造业、现代国防科技工业的关键元素。近年来，武夷山国家公园周边地区出现了非法开采稀土的犯罪行为，损害国家稀土资源储备，严重威胁国家公园环境资源安全。本案被告人以原地浸矿法开采稀土矿，危害到武夷山国家公园的生态服务功能和生态系统稳定性，容易导致植被破坏、山体裸露、水源污染、水土流失、山体滑坡、地面裂缝和沉降等严重后果发生。人民法院在开采的矿产品价值和造成矿产资源破坏的价值均已查明的情况下，以造成矿产资源破坏的价值认定被告人非法采矿行为情节特别严重，依法严厉惩处非法开采稀土犯罪，在法定刑幅度范围内从严处罚，并严格控制缓刑的适用，有利于保障国家战略性资源的开发利用，守护国家公园生态安全。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;span>;&lt;strong>;二、张某强非法制造枪支、非法狩猎案&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;【基本案情】&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;2017年期间，被告人张某强到海南省海口市某五金店购买一把射钉枪、一根枪管及铁砂、射钉弹后，使用其自有工具组装枪型物1支。经鉴定，张某强制造的枪型物为利用火药为发射动力的枪支。 2022年3月21日凌晨，张某强在未经野生动物行政主管部门许可，且无狩猎证和持枪证的情况下，擅自进入被划为禁猎区的海南热带雨林国家公园霸王岭分局洪水管护站内狩猎，使用枪支共猎捕赤腹松鼠3只、椰子猫1只、鼬獾1只，使用头照灯照射猎捕大绿臭蛙30只。张某强于次日下山途中被公安民警当场抓获。经鉴定，案涉椰子猫属国家二级保护野生动物，鼬獾、赤腹松鼠均被列入《国家保护的有益的或者有重要经济、科学研究价值的陆生野生动物名录》，臭蛙属于海南省重点保护陆生野生动物。海南省人民检察院第二分院以张某强犯非法制造枪支、非法狩猎罪提起公诉。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;【裁判结果】&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;海南省第二中级人民法院经审理认为，张某强行为已构成非法制造枪支罪、非法狩猎罪，应当数罪并罚。张某强作为生活在国家公园范围区刚脱贫的村民，改变当地的传统生产生活方式，走绿色发展改善民生之路，尚需探索时间。张某强是家中主要劳动力，对其羁押既不符合刑法谦抑性原则，也可能使其家庭重返贫困。法律的权威在于刑罚的不可避免性，而非严苛，在能使用较轻刑罚达到制裁目的时，无需使用严厉的制裁方式。鉴于张某强系初犯，案发后如实供述其罪行，认罪认罚且有悔罪表现，其居住地愿意配合进行社区矫正，宣告缓刑对所居住社区没有重大不良影响。遂判决：张某强数罪并罚，决定执行有期徒刑三年，缓刑五年，没收犯罪工具等。宣判后，各方未上诉、抗诉，一审判决已发生法律效力。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;【典型意义】&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;2022年4月，习近平总书记在海南考察调研时明确指出热带雨林国家公园是国宝，是水库、粮库、钱库，更是碳库，要求对热带雨林实行严格保护，实现生态保护、绿色发展、民生改善相统一。尽管海南热带雨林国家公园建设过程中对环境资源保护的力度不断加大，国家公园附近的原住村民对热带雨林及生物多样性资源的损害性利用仍时有发生。本案中，被告人违反狩猎法规，在禁猎区使用改造的枪支及其它工具狩猎，破坏野生动物资源的价值较大，应当受到刑事制裁。同时，人民法院充分考虑被告人的个体因素，给予其改过自新的机会，对其适用缓刑，避免刚脱贫的家庭因刑返贫，彰显司法的人文关怀，实现了惩罚和预防犯罪相结合的目的，也较好平衡了生态环境保护和民生保障之间的关系。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;&lt;span>;【裁判结果】&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;四川省绵阳市安州区人民法院经审理认为，杨某、屈某敏、高某虎违反国家规定，非法处置危险废物，严重污染环境，构成污染环境罪。三被告人系共同犯罪，犯罪作用相当，不区分主从犯；三被告人主动投案并如实供述自己的罪行，系自首，依法可以从轻或减轻处罚；三被告人自愿认罪认罚，可从宽处理；三被告人主动退缴全部违法所得，可酌情从轻处罚。遂判决：杨某、屈某敏、高某虎有期徒刑各九个月、缓刑各一年，并分别处以罚金1.5万元，没收三人违法所得3.3万元（已追缴）。宣判后，各方未上诉、抗诉，一审判决已发生法律效力。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;【典型意义】&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;森林土壤是发展林业生产的物质基础。近年来，部分不法分子受利益驱使，侵占山场林地，非法回收废机油、倾倒有毒有害物质，对林地土壤及其附作物造成严重破坏，打破森林的生态平衡，损害公共利益。本案案发地毗邻大熊猫国家公园保护区域，由于废机油污染介质具有流动性、迁移性，因此针对废机油导致的环境污染事件，不应仅以国家公园边界为准，而需要对国家公园毗邻区域全方位一体化保护。本案中，人民法院依法惩处污染环境的犯罪行为，全面加强环境资源保护力度，坚守人与自然和谐共生，践行绿水青山就是金山银山理念，为加快形成绿色发展方式，促进经济发展和环境保护双赢提供法治保障。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;&lt;span>;【裁判结果】&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;吉林省珲春林区基层法院经审理认为，王某民、沙某等六人违反林木采伐许可证规定数量、树种和采伐方式，任意采伐林木，数量巨大，其行为构成滥伐林木罪。王某民、沙某违反国家规定，故意采伐国家重点保护植物紫椴，情节严重，构成危害国家重点保护植物罪。对王某民、沙某应当以滥伐林木罪和危害国家重点保护植物罪实行数罪并罚。王某民等六人犯罪行为严重破坏生态环境、危及生物多样性保护，使社会公共利益受到严重损害，应承担民事侵权责任。遂判处：王某民等六人二年至七年不等的有期徒刑，并处1万元至120万元不等的罚金；王某民承担修复生态环境综合费用156万余元，沙某、张某奎、杨某对此承担连带责任，刘某军、徐某仁对其中14万元承担连带责任，鉴定费用5千元由六被告共同承担。宣判后，各方未上诉、抗诉，一审判决已发生法律效力。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;【典型意义】&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;本案系发生在东北虎豹国家公园范围内滥伐林木及危害国家重点保护植物的案件。东北虎豹国家公园内优质的森林资源和完整的生物链为东北虎、豹等珍稀野生动物提供了良好的生态家园。随着国家公园保护力度的加大，近年来，几十年不见的东北虎、豹重回故里繁衍生息。紫椴有“象牙板”和“世界四大行道树”的美称，具有较大的药用、欣赏和经济价值，属于国家濒危保护物种以及国家二级保护野生植物。本案中，人民法院依法对滥伐林木行为和故意采伐国家重点保护植物行为予以数罪并罚，加大对破坏森林资源犯罪的惩治和震慑力度；同时判令行为人赔偿生态环境修复费用，对保护东北虎豹栖息地生物多样性和生态系统安全具有积极作用。本案裁判后，人民法院践行能动司法理念，立足东北虎豹国家公园生态资源管护实际，向有关部门发出司法建议，推动形成国家公园保护的强大合力。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;&lt;span>;【裁判结果】&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;西宁市中级人民法院经审查认为，青海某水电开发公司不能清偿到期债务，且有明显丧失清偿能力的可能，对青海某水电开发公司实施破产重整，将更有利于保护债权人、债务人及企业职工的整体利益，也有利于解决项目停工造成的黄河上游干流度汛安全以及生态环境修复治理难题。本案重整计划的制作、表决程序及内容均符合法律规定，且具有可行性。遂裁定：批准青海某水电开发公司重整计划，终止重整程序。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;【典型意义】&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;本案水电站位于青海省海南州同德县和果洛州玛沁县交界处的黄河干流，地处三江源国家公园范围内，是国家“十二五”规划建设的重点水电项目。案涉项目停工不但对经济发展和移民安置等造成负面影响，也对黄河上游干流安全度汛以及生态修复、环境治理造成极大影响。人民法院受理并开展破产重整后，充分发挥审判职能作用，妥善处理保护和发展的关系，加强与政府相关部门的协调，促成案涉水电站全面复工，有效化解了企业破产纠纷，也使三江源国家公园内黄河上游防汛工作得到加强，因项目停工可能带来的生态环境治理困境也迎刃而解。同时，玛尔挡“水光风一体化”综合能源基地的建设，也将带动三江源国家公园周边区域能源结构优化，有利于推动当地经济社会绿色高质量发展再上新台阶。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;

&lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;2023年10月7日下午，科技部召开领导干部会议，宣布阴和俊任党组书记。 &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（人民视觉/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2023年10月10日，科技部党组书记阴和俊会见来访的英国皇家工程院院长、思克莱德大学校长吉姆·麦克唐纳德爵士一行。在科技部官网的报道中，这是阴和俊上任后的首个公开活动。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2023年10月7日下午，科技部召开领导干部会议，宣布阴和俊任党组书记。阴和俊的前任王志刚生于1957年，担任科技部党组书记职务11年。而2023年3月发布的国务院机构改革方案中，科技部迎来5年内第二次重组。阴和俊成为科技部重组后首位新任党组书记。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;作为学者型官员，阴和俊曾在高校、科研机构任职多年。多名受访专家认为，相比2018年的机构改革，此次重组后，科技部着重要解决的是基础研究和“卡脖子”问题。这也是阴和俊要直面的挑战。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;多次填补科技和军工装备领域空白&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;身为二十届中央委员的阴和俊是山西古交人，生于1963年1月。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;1980年代，阴和俊从太原工学院（现太原理工大学）毕业后先后在太原工学院、太原工业大学工作。 1986年9月，他到西安电子科技大学攻读硕士研究生，1992年又到中国科学院电子学所攻读博士研究生。 1995年，阴和俊博士毕业后选择留在中国科学院电子学所工作，直至2015年11月。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在中国科学院工作的20年间，阴和俊担任过中国科学院高技术研究与发展局局长，并于2008年1月升任副院长。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2015年11月，阴和俊转任科技部副部长，分管高新技术和国际合作。 16个月后的2017年3月，54岁的阴和俊任北京市委常委，一个月后兼任北京市副市长。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当时，北京市政府领导向人大常委会介绍阴和俊时提到，他“熟悉科研和科技管理工作，思路比较开阔……主要从事国家重大科技专项、战略性科技先导专项、国防科技创新等方面工作……多次填补我国科技和军工装备领域空白”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;到地方任职后，阴和俊负责的工作依然和科技有关，分管市科委、经信委、国资委、质监局、知识产权局、中关村管委会、经济技术开发区管委会，联系市科协、市通信管理局。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2016年9月，到北京工作前，阴和俊在一次演讲中提到，要“围绕拓展创新发展空间，统筹国内国际两个大局，支持北京、上海建设具有全球影响力的科技创新中心”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;担任北京市领导后，阴和俊到市科委调研时强调，要充分利用首都科技创新资源，统筹协调在京高校、科研院所、企业等各方面力量参与科技创新中心建设，推动形成协同创新的更大合力。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;而6年后的2023年5月26日，《北京国际科技创新中心建设情况评估报告》发布。评估认为，北京原始创新和科技源头供给能力实现了提升，在建立新型举国体制方面作出了示范性探索，“初步建成具有全球影响力的科技创新中心”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在北京一年多之后，2018年10月，阴和俊跨省转任天津市委副书记。在天津工作时，阴和俊多次提到“科技创新”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2020年11月，阴和俊回到中国科学院，任中国科学院党组副书记、副院长。中国科学院一国家重点实验室主任告诉南方周末记者，阴和俊非常重视国家重大科技和军工方面工作，分管重大任务局。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;“中央一级的重组基本落地”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;阴和俊履新科技部5天后，2023年10月12日，中国机构编制网连发5份通知，通报工信部、生态环境部、国家卫健委、中国人民银行和中国社会科学院等的职责、机构、编制调整情况。 5份通知中，有3份和科技部相关。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;通知显示，将科技部的组织拟订高新技术发展及产业化规划和政策等职责划入工信部；将科技部的组织拟订科技促进生态环境发展规划和政策职责划入生态环境部；将科学技术部的组织拟订科技促进卫生健康发展规划和政策职责划入国家卫健委。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;和职责一同划分到其他部门的，还有对应的人员编制。华南理工大学公共管理学院教授王福涛长期关注科技政策，在他看来，编制的调整也意味着科技部“在中央一级的重组基本落地”，“这和年初的改革方案是完全一致的”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2023年3月10日，《国务院机构改革方案》发布，强调要加强科学技术等六个重点领域的机构职责优化和调整。方案提到了具体的十三项细分工作，其中，“重新组建科学技术部”为十三项工作之首。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2023年3月16日，《党和国家机构改革方案》公布，表示要组建中央科技委员会，方案强调，中央科技委员会办事机构职责由重组后的科技部整体承担。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;也是在这份改革方案中，对于科技部的重组，给出了时间限制：“中央层面的改革任务力争在2023年年底前完成，地方层面的改革任务力争在2024年年底前完成。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;概括地说，在中央层面，此次科技部改革涉及科技部和其他部门在职能上的重合及科技成果转化问题。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在大连理工大学经济管理学院教授孙玉涛看来，科技工作涵盖了经济、社会、生态、文化等多个方面，而工信部、生态环境部、卫健委等部门也有自己的科技司，两者都包括科技在具体领域的应用问题。通过改革，科技部的这部分职能回到具体的职能部门，再加上中央科技委的设置，“加强了整体的统筹协调”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在另一位长期关注科技政策的学者看来，科技部被调整的这部分职能具有两个典型特点：“一是这些问题基本能依赖市场机制解决问题，或者说用市场机制来解决更有效率；二是这些问题影响的不是战略性问题。”他补充：“比如说数字化，当然快一点好，但是慢个一年半载，也不涉及&#39;要命的事情&#39;，即&#39;卡脖子&#39;问题。”&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;“卡脖子”等重大专项仍在&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;手里&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;把时间线再拉长一些，近十年来，涉及科技部的改革、重组共有3次。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;孙玉涛长期关注中国科研经费政策，他解释称，2014年，科技体制改革主要和科研经费有关。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;中国科学院科技政策与管理科学研究所研究员李晓轩曾在《光明日报》撰文指出，《关于改进加强中央财政科研项目和资金管理的若干意见》直面经费管理中的越位和缺位并存的问题，是2014年的重磅改革措施。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;该文件的核心内容体现在两个方面，一是针对原有经费管理存在的重复、分散、低效、监管乏力等问题，提出旨在促进规范化管理的整体改革思路。二是遵循科研活动规律，在操作层面强调按照实际成本编制经费预算，取消人员费简单按比例设置的规定。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;《关于深化中央财政科技计划（专项、基金等）管理改革的方案》则预示中国科技计划体系即将迎来一次“大手术”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;原来分散在约40个部门近百项竞争性科技计划优化整合为国家自然科学基金、国家科技重大专项、国家重点研发计划、技术创新引导专项（基金）和基地与人才专项等5大类。政府管理仅限于宏观层面，微观层面的项目评审与管理交给专业机构。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“原来的国家科技计划分很多科研项目，当时就有很多人说这些项目太分散了，各个部委都有钱去支持科技发展，&#39;九龙治水&#39;。”孙玉涛解释，“改革后，这些项目都集中到了科技部，所以有人称这次改革是&#39;扩权的改革&#39;。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;科研经费改革后，2018年3月，十三届全国人大一次会议披露了科技部第一次重组的方案，提出将科学技术部、国家外国专家局的职责整合，重新组建科学技术部，作为国务院组成部门。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在前述不具名专家看来，相较于此次由中央编办推动的改革，2018年的改革更多还是由科技部本身在主导。在该专家看来，彼时的改革可以看成是此次改革的尝试：“在当时的国际环境下，我们还是主张要走开放合作的路线，只是在资源的投入方式上进行了一些调整，但效果不太理想。所以这一次改革就升格了，涉及对组织架构的深层次调整。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;不在孙玉涛看来，改革的主要目的是为了应对当前面临的挑战：“为什么现在要这么调整？这说明我们当前遇到的问题需要通过改革来解决。十年之后这个问题不存在了，这些职能是不是会调回科技部，那也不好说。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;科技部在此次改革后着重要解决的就是基础研究和“卡脖子”问题。前述专家解释：“&#39;卡脖子&#39;问题包含重大专项，这部分工作是科技部改革之后依然留在手里的，而且升格为由中央来抓。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;孙玉涛亦表示，从科研的角度来讲，基础研究的重要性非常高：“从基础研究，到应用研究，再到试验发展，越往后，要投入的钱越多；但是越往前，越重要。没有基础研究，怎么可能做得出后面的东西？”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;基础研究之外，国家科技重大专项来自《国家中长期科学和技术发展规划纲要(2006—2020年)》，包含了大型飞机、载人航天与探月工程等16个项目。值得注意的是，阴和俊此前就有参与重大专项的经历。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;公开信息显示，2008年9月25日，神舟七号载人飞船发射成功，阴和俊为神舟七号任务总指挥部副总指挥长；2013年12月，嫦娥三号发射成功，阴和俊曾以探月工程副总指挥的身份接受媒体采访。 &lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;这起牵动人心的儿童海滩失踪案，有了一个明确的结论。一个美好的生命就这样夭折，令人扼腕叹息。对于遭受丧女之痛的家庭来说，这是不可承受之重，很可能成为这个家庭一个永远难以愈合的伤口。在整个事件中有疏忽的孩子父亲，恐怕会长期生活在愧疚与自我谴责之中，这种精神折磨将是终身性的。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当孩子在海滩失踪后，网上对这个家庭与父亲的非议不小，如诬称这个父亲是继父，造谣这个家庭“重男轻女”、故意造成女童死亡等。这种以“正义”示人的恶意与谎言，本身给这个家庭施加了更大的伤害，应该予以谴责。除此之外，网上也不乏要求将孩子父亲入刑的声音，治以“过失致人死亡罪”，这样才能震慑不负责任的父母。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;如何认识后一种观点？现在，从小孩一进入幼儿园开始，每年都有各种防溺水的安全教育，但中国每年溺水死亡的儿童，从绝对数字看并不少。据中国疾控中心慢病中心和全球儿童安全组织统计，2010年-2015年，平均每年有54194名青少年儿童因伤害死亡（148人/天），溺水、道路交通伤害和跌倒/坠落为前三位伤害死因。人民网发布的《2022中国青少年防溺水大数据报告》指出，因溺水造成的伤亡位居中国0-17岁年龄段首位，占比高达33%，“截至2022年上半年，多起新闻报道不减反增，青少年群体溺水事故频发”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在这些未成年人溺水死亡事件中，有父母在现场但分心疏忽而导致悲剧发生的，有游泳馆不容许父母进入而自身又没有能力保障孩子安全的，还有较大的孩子瞒着父母与同伴去河道、水库玩水或游泳而出现意外的。要是以“过失致人死亡罪”治第一类父母的罪，恐怕会出现不少案例，也很难产生显著的“震慑与预防”效果，反而不乏副作用。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;尽管中国已经实施“全面三孩”政策，目前的总和生育率是非常低的，每年新生儿出生人数仍在下降通道中。在这种情况下，仍愿意生一个孩子、两个孩子的，往往真是因为爱孩子。因为传承了自己的基因，父母对孩子的爱是非常强烈的、给孩子的付出意愿是非常高的。可以说，在这个世界上，最爱孩子、最关心孩子福祉的就是他们的父母了。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在这种情况下，要对因本人疏忽导致孩子死亡的父母治罪，首先是不人道、不近人情的，子女是父母生命的延续，绝大部分父母没有主观意愿伤害自己的孩子或将自己的孩子置于险境，当然极少数兽父兽母故意伤害孩子理应入刑；其次，也不能起到提升父母“尽职程度”的作用，难道父母悉心养育孩子、愿意为孩子创造最好的一切，是怕被刑法惩罚吗？如果真是如此，那TA最为理性的考量一定是不生孩子，而不是每天对着刑法照看孩子。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;有人拿西方国家来举例：父母把幼儿独自留在家里或别的什么地方会被剥夺监护权。但客观分析可能存在的两类情况：孩子随父母长大、容许父母有偶尔疏忽；因父母偶尔把幼儿独自留在家中，然后把孩子交给别的家庭或儿童福利机构抚养，哪一种更有利于儿童的身心健康与福祉？尊重亲亲之情显然对儿童更有利。而且，这种做法属于对家庭这一自然血缘共同体的粗暴干预与践踏，产生的问题比宣称要解决的问题多得多、大得多。只有在父母故意伤害孩子、对儿童的身心健康与福祉明显不利时，才应该剥夺父母的监护权。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;所谓监护权，不是一种武断的权力，其实是满满的责任与付出，背后是爱，在孩子成年之前也不会有任何经济收益。父母要给孩子提供包括衣食住行在内的一切经济资源让孩子健康成长，还要保护孩子的安全，免受各种自然与人为风险的侵扰。君不见，有多少父母因孩子被人贩子绑架而不放弃追寻的步伐？&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;尽管悲剧已经发生，但我们也不应该要求为人父母者成神成圣，行动上永远不能出错：父母必须绝对确保孩子的安全，孩子受到任何伤害都必须追究父母的责任。这是对人性的苛求，也不符合现实。总之，尊重亲亲之情，尊重家庭，对为人父母者有共情与理解，权力对家庭保持必要的谦抑，不仅更有利于儿童的成长与福祉，本身也是捍卫家庭之为文明的根基。&lt;/p>;

&lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Lion head. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Everyone knows what Yangzhou Lion Head is. Of course it is a famous dish and no one is stupid enough to think of a fishy and dirty lion&#39;s head. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But Cubans really think you are going to take a bite of a lion&#39;s head - when Tao Yan first introduced this dish to the &quot;guard captain&quot; in Spanish, the latter&#39;s severe facial twitching showed that he was So understood. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The best Chinese restaurant in Havana is called &quot;Temple of Heaven Hotel&quot;. The owner, Tao Yan, is my friend. He graduated from Shanghai Second Medical University and came to Havana very early. There are not many overseas Chinese in Havana. He has been The idea was to Cubanize his Chinese food. Cubans are very sweet and aromatic, so their Chinese dishes try to be as &quot;sweet and fragrant&quot; as possible, such as pig&#39;s trotters braised with sea cucumber, catfish stewed with tofu, and sweet and sour braised lamb chops, all with a large amount of Cuban sugar. Cubans can’t even figure out why Chinese food ingredients are so well matched. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Yangzhou lion head is the signature of the &quot;Temple of Heaven&quot;. After the captain of the guard knew that this &quot;lion head&quot; was actually a &quot;pig head&quot;, he came here often relying on his relationship with Tao Yantie. He was a tall man with a height of 1.9 meters. He was impatient with small dishes and specialized in picking big dishes. It’s a piece of meat, so I’m full of praise for the lion’s head in the “Temple of Heaven”. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I was sitting next to the captain of the guard that day. We also ordered the lion&#39;s head and thought it was &quot;too un-Yangzhou&quot;. It was like &quot;noodles&quot;. The ratio of starch to minced meat was wrong. The meat was too little. The ingredients were not in place. The taste was &quot;wooden&quot;. My wife felt itchy and said, I Come and give it a try! &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Her cooking method was passed down directly from her neighbor, a woman from Yangzhou. The first thing is the choice of pork. You cannot overemphasize the &quot;essence&quot;, it should be &quot;mixed with essence and oil (fat)&quot;, but it cannot be pork belly, it must be sandwiched. meat, and remove the fascia; minced pork cannot be the product of a meat grinder. It must be cut into small pieces first, then finely diced, and then minced into minced meat, but not too fine, as it will &quot;stick to the knife&quot;. This takes effort. Then add salt (or soy sauce), sugar, monosodium glutamate, minced green onions, diced fried dough sticks, rice wine, and appropriate amount of starch, and stir in one direction, usually clockwise, also called &quot;shangjin&quot;, until it is thick and sticky, waiting for frying. There is another trick here that is ignored by the outside world, that is, &quot;fine diced water chestnuts&quot; must be included in the ingredients. Water chestnuts are called &quot;di pear&quot; in Shanghai and &quot;horse hoof&quot; in the north. You can only buy canned water chestnuts in Cuba. . As for fried dough sticks, they are not available in Cuba, but local fried dough sticks can be substituted. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tao Yan looked on, his eyes widened and he was dumbfounded, and said, my lion head is just a mixture of minced meat, MSG, flour, onion, ginger, and soy sauce, and then deep-fried, you have to add so much Ingredients? ! My wife said that it is best not to add ginger, but out of habit I would add less ginger, as the flavor would be too strong. The last key is that the outside of each meat ball is not smeared with egg paste until before frying. The egg paste is made as follows: Beat eggs to one ratio of flour. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It must be fried hard, braised in brown sauce and reduced in juice. The lion&#39;s head is delicious when it&#39;s hard on the outside and tender on the inside. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Cubans are straightforward and came to taste the lion’s head the next day. As soon as he tasted it, he stood up and made a phone call. Not long after, a large group of relatives came. There were more than ten of them. They sat neatly like thugs all over the yard. They all looked at the dining table and sat in rows. , eat fruit. This is a Cuban custom. Once there is delicious food, the whole family comes to share it. However, Tao Yan was frightened and explained to the guard captain in Spanish that today was just a trial production and it was impossible to supply a large group of people at once. The guard captain blinked his eyes honestly and refused to leave. My family is here and I want them to go back. Where can I put my face? ! &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tao Yan was frightened. Please call my wife urgently. &quot;So many big eaters?!&quot; The wife couldn&#39;t help but groan. The lion&#39;s head was slightly smaller than a tennis ball. The captain of the guard could swallow 10 of them by himself. But what! How many &quot;noodles&quot; are there from the past? she asked. The answer is that there are many in the refrigerator. The wife asked to take them all out, defrost them, took a large bottle of mayonnaise, dipped the &quot;gnocchi&quot; in the heavy flavor, turned on the oil pan, and fried it over high heat. The aroma was overflowing, and served it hot to the relatives of the guard captain. Have to howl. The inside of the &quot;gnocchi&quot; is not that good, but the egg skin shell is especially crispy and salty when fried. This is a particularly pleasing thing for my wife. But the guard captain is not stupid. He knew that his wife&#39;s lion&#39;s head was better, and she knew the taste after eating the marrow, so within a few days he actually brought &quot;Whitebeard&quot;, a high-ranking official from Cuba. Of course, I didn’t forget to notify you in advance this time. &quot;Whitebeard&quot; is a close comrade of Castro. He drives a black Audi. As soon as he comes in, he says that he has brought a &quot;mysterious guest&quot; without permission. He heard that the &quot;Chinese Lion Head&quot; is particularly delicious and wants it. Have a taste. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tao Yan was dumbfounded when he saw it. She was an old lady with a noble status! He also had a young grandson with him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He turned sideways and leaned back as a habit. There was a large group of people in the yard, sitting in rows, eating fruits. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;This is our custom.&quot; The guard captain explained again. He also said that the people who paid this time were all relatives of &quot;White Beard&quot;. When Cubans go to dinner parties, they like to bring their entire family. This time I really learned the lesson. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It can be seen that the behavior of &quot;White Beard&quot; and the old lady is quite elegant. They gently bite open the lion&#39;s head, the inside is pink, and there is a slight gravy in the steaming heat, but the elegance does not diminish their elegance. Appetite, thumbs up while swallowing, the delicacies in the big basin are rapidly decreasing, and the guard captain&#39;s companionship has accelerated their disappearance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Because it was impossible to estimate the number of people who would &quot;sit in rows and eat fruit&quot;, there was a shortage of seats for the lion head, so my wife hurriedly took advantage of the opportunity to make it. Of course, it was too luxurious to chop the meat by hand, so I directly used a meat grinder, but The problem is, a catastrophic accident occurs unexpectedly. China runs out of green onions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Chives are a scarce commodity in Havana. The Chinese usually save on using them. Now that they are suddenly out of stock, where should they go to replenish them? Tao Yan suddenly caught a glimpse of the onions in the corner of the room. Isn’t an onion an onion? Although the taste difference is huge, it&#39;s hard to tell. &quot;The question is, what if Cubans happen to be good at this?!&quot; The wife asked Tao Yan coldly. The two looked at each other and understood. The latter immediately jumped into action and pulled out a large bag of onions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As you can imagine, the whole room was filled with the smell of onions fried in a big oil pan, and &quot;White Beard&quot; and the old lady couldn&#39;t sit still. People in the compound couldn&#39;t sit still. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;White Beard&quot; said, why is it getting more and more fragrant? For the sake of the continuation of this fragrance, I am even willing to launch another cooking &quot;revolution&quot;! &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The people in the compound left their original positions like the mud of a barrier lake, and squeezed into the dining room bit by bit like toothpaste. They shouted in Spanish and pushed each other. No one dared. Head straight to the table. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The final outcome is predictable. A famous dish was born in Havana. It is no longer called Yangzhou lion head, but has a more Cuban name: onion lion head. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;获取更多RSS：&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 19 Oct 2023 23:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[黑龙江省人大常委会原副主任宋希斌一审获刑14年]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258838]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-19 22:30:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/18/8d32eea8c44f27b9b172302b6fc2430a.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1000&quot; height=&quot;680&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/ 23/10/18/8d32eea8c44f27b9b172302b6fc2430a.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;254466&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;On October 17, 2023, the Shenyang Intermediate People’s Court of Liaoning Province publicly pronounced the verdict of the Heilongjiang Provincial People’s Congress Standing Committee in the first instance In the case of former party member and deputy director Song Xibin accepting bribes and embezzling public funds, the defendant Song Xibin was sentenced to 13 years in prison for accepting bribes and fined RMB 3 million; he was sentenced to three years in prison for embezzling public funds and decided to execute the term He was sentenced to 14 years in prison and fined RMB 3 million; the property obtained from bribery and the interest therefrom shall be recovered in accordance with the law and turned over to the state treasury. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;&lt;strong>;It was found after trial: &lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;From 2005 to 2021, the defendant Song Xibin successively used his position as the Daxinganling Prefectural Committee of Heilongjiang Province Deputy Secretary, Administrative Commissioner, Director of the Forestry Administration, Secretary of the Daxinganling Prefectural Committee, Director of the Heilongjiang Provincial Development and Reform Commission, Deputy Secretary of the Harbin Municipal Committee and Mayor, Member and Deputy Director of the Party Leadership Group of the Standing Committee of the Heilongjiang Provincial People&#39;s Congress, Chairman of the Heilongjiang Provincial Federation of Trade Unions, etc. With the convenience in the field, as well as the convenient conditions for the formation of authority and status, it provided assistance to relevant units and individuals in matters such as business operations, land replacement, project contracting, job promotion, etc., and illegally accepted property from others equivalent to more than 35.32 million yuan. In 2014, Song Xibin took advantage of his position as deputy secretary of the Harbin Municipal Party Committee and mayor to seek personal interests and decided to lend 50 million yuan of Harbin&#39;s special fiscal funds to other units in the name of his unit for profit-making activities. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The Shenyang Intermediate People’s Court held that defendant Song Xibin’s behavior constituted the crime of accepting bribes and misappropriating public funds. In view of the fact that Song Xibin truthfully confessed his crimes after arriving at the case, and took the initiative to explain most of the criminal facts of bribery and misappropriation of public funds that were not yet known to the supervisory authorities. The crime of misappropriation of public funds constituted surrender; he pleaded guilty and repented, and actively returned the stolen goods. All the bribes and stolen goods have been recovered, and the misappropriated goods have been recovered. All public funds have been recovered before the first instance trial, and there are legal, discretionary or mitigated punishment circumstances. According to the law, he can be given a lighter punishment for the crime of accepting bribes and a reduced punishment for the crime of misappropriating public funds. The court then made the above judgment. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 19 Oct 2023 22:55:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[电梯事故频频发生，一图读懂如何自救？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258923]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-19 22:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/19/9849783f0d.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;8581&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/19/9849783f0d.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254649&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;获取更多RSS：&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 19 Oct 2023 22:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[1840年以来的中国与美国（上）丨倬彼云汉]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258853]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-19 21:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/19/bOI8j4tun986ghWujNQdJnuMPrxPcdSK9CR1TImi.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;692&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/19/bOI8j4tun986ghWujNQdJnuMPrxPcdSK9CR1 TImi. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254579&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Between 1872 and 1875, initiated by Rong Hong and supported by Zeng Guofan and Li Hongzhang , the Qing government sent four batches of 120 students to study in the United States. The average age of these students when they went abroad was only twelve years old. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Wedge&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The exchanges between China and the United States, if we start with the opium epidemic in 1840 It has been almost two hundred years since the war began. The young republic of the United States is making its first cry. In such a long process, the ups and downs, grievances and resentments between China and the United States are a very complicated record. Since China switched to welcoming the world, the entanglement between China and the United States is probably more complicated than the relationship between China and any other country in history, and has far-reaching consequences. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So, after receiving the mission of writing this article from Mr. Chen Fangzheng, I thought about it for a long time - I felt that I should write: Because this big topic is not only related to China and the United States, It can almost be said that the fate of the world in the past two hundred years has been inseparable from Sino-US relations in many cases. The turn in Sino-US relations often leads to a turn in world history - of course, China&#39;s destiny also changes accordingly, and similarly the destiny of the United States is also turbulent. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The reason I say this is because the basic pattern of Sino-US relations over the past two hundred years is: there is a host-object relationship between the strong and the weak. Because the United States has its own ideals, policies for founding the country, and choices it made to measure its position in the world at that time, if there are changes in its policy toward China, it will mostly be the United States that takes the initiative. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So, when discussing this issue, I often use the above perspective as a constantly changing clue to consider: Why did the United States do this in that specific time and space? In terms of Sino-U.S. relations, given the characteristics of time and space, how will the United States&#39; actions affect its own development direction and the overall international balance? Will the ensuing world situation lead to disaster or peace? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When I dictated this article &quot;China and the United States since 1840&quot;, I actually had mixed feelings in my heart. The relationship between China and the United States has its share of grievances and grievances, as well as unavoidable entanglements. Looking around the world, the help we receive from the United States is more significant and far-reaching than that of other countries. However, China is even more constrained by the United States and forced to go in many unexpected directions - this is not what China wants, and it also has a great impact on China&#39;s overall history. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Trade between China and the United States&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In 1840, Britain and China fought the first Opium War. In fact, the opium traders operating in Hong Kong at that time were not only British, but also Americans. The United States, a recently established emerging country, has also followed the United Kingdom in participating in international trade—China trade is a piece of meat that it must get involved in. At that time, he was following Charles Elliot in planning how to use force to open China&#39;s trade door, and American businessman Thomas Perkins was also involved. To this day, the Perkins family is still an important part of the New England family in the United States. They did the same, bringing opium in ships and taking away Chinese porcelain, tea and other commercial goods. However, this kind of trade is not permitted by Chinese law, which means that Britain is already conducting trade while forcibly opening the door to China. Although it was Britain that launched the First Opium War, its sponsors also included American businessmen in Hong Kong. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;China was defeated in this war and was forced to sign the Treaty of Nanjing with Britain. In 1844, the United States sent envoy Caleb Cushing to sign the Treaty of Wangxia with Qi Ying, the general representative of China and the governor of Guangdong and Guangxi. Since then, China and the United States established diplomatic relations, and Gu Sheng was the first minister. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After taking office as minister, Gu Sheng said that he was very excited and felt that this was a difficult responsibility. This youngest country, which had just emerged from the civil war and was involved in world politics and international relations for the first time, actually officially established relations with the longest-lived Eastern Empire in the world. He believed this was an important milestone in human history. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I live in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA, and I would like to tell you something that is very meaningful to me. On February 2, 1784, the birthday of George Washington, the &quot;Empress of China&quot; sailed from New York Harbor to China. It was the first merchant ship sent by the United States to China. What they brought was not opium, but thirty tons of wild ginseng collected near Pittsburgh (known as &quot;American ginseng&quot; or &quot;American ginseng&quot; in China), as well as leather, pepper, cotton and other commodities; taken from China, It is porcelain, tea, silk and other commercial goods - these are the typical products sold by China to the United States in Sino-US trade. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On several occasions, as a staff member of Taiwan&#39;s &quot;Academia Sinica&quot;, I visited Harvard University to negotiate cooperation matters, and I stayed in Harvard hotels. This hotel is an old-fashioned New England residence, with a wooden house, ancient wooden beds, and the rooms are filled with Chinese porcelain shipped by American merchants in the early days. In addition to China&#39;s own porcelain, we can also see trade porcelain specially fired for the United States and Britain, and we can also see Chinese silk fabrics used as decoration. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Such a scene made me feel that time and space were reversed: a young Chinese man went to the highest university in the United States to discuss academic cooperation - and in the room where I lived, all the people surrounding me were ancient Chinese objects. . This is something worthy of commemoration and worthy of my lifelong memories and emotions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since then, American merchant ships have entered China one after another. Although there were already motorized ships at that time, many of them had a combination of motors and sails. The &quot;Queen of China&quot; is a fairly large mixed-aircraft and sail ship, and the &quot;Chinese Scissor&quot; is even larger and faster. By around 1860, there were three ports for trading ships to depart from North America: San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Vancouver, Canada. They come and go regularly, traveling across the Pacific Ocean between the two coasts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the second half of the nineteenth century, the United States experienced the Civil War. The overall development direction has changed from developing new land to entering industrialization. Moreover, the most important projects in the development of the United States are the construction of large cross-state railways to the west, as well as the development of farmland and the construction of cities in the western half of the United States. Hundreds of thousands of Chinese workers provided important help in these tasks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In other words, the reason why the United States became the United States was that it transformed from an old British colony into a major country spanning two oceans. This process is of great significance to East Asia on the Pacific side; Sino-US relations have also gone through a very abnormal process. For example, Chinese workers who have made significant contributions are trapped by the Chinese Exclusion Act and cannot immigrate into the United States like European workers. As the United States has become a big country that spans two oceans, its industrial products can naturally enter the Chinese market more conveniently than Europe. Previously, the trade direction of Chinese daily necessities imported into the United States has since shifted to the direction of American products entering the Chinese market. Europeans competed for the trade markets of this vast and populous empire. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since then, these ships have brought countless Chinese young people to the United States for education. The first group of more than 100 Chinese children brought by Rong Hong entered American middle schools and then furthered their studies. After these &quot;young children studying in the United States&quot; returned to China after completing their studies, they worked in various fields such as diplomacy, business, and education. The beginning of this phase of Sino-US relations is of immeasurable significance to the Chinese people. The American influence brought by these people extended to the students who came to the United States under the so-called &quot;Gengzi Indemnity&quot; (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 毷体, 毷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Gengzi Indemnity&lt;/span>;) - this Among them, a very important figure is Hu Shi; of course, there are many other figures, including my mentor Li Jizhi. More than half of them have made significant contributions to China&#39;s modernization, are either scholars in pioneering research fields, or are extraordinary people who have created extraordinary careers. They also include the Nationalist Government&#39;s ambassador to the United States and figures in charge of foreign affairs in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of China. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Education in the United States and Modern China&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;At the beginning of the twentieth century, the world also changed a lot. The capitalist economy, which uses machine industry to produce goods, has swallowed up the entire world quickly and massively. Under this drastic change, white people not only became the masters of the world, but also competed among themselves for the &quot;leading&quot; position of exploiting the world. In Europe, there was World War I. In that war, the capitalist economy faced its first test: the germination and growth of international communism brought the world into the division of left and right; also in the modern Western state system, the communist system and its associated The ideal of symbiotic social good and social welfare. The United States only entered the war in the late stages of the European War. General John J. Pershing led the American war troops and declared to Britain and France: We are back and we are participating in the common affairs of the Old Continent. In Chinese history, the word &quot;West&quot; has since been divided into left and right sides; and this division has made China have to make choices in its struggle to break away from the old empire. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the process of importing Western ideas, American missionaries established schools in China, which was an important process. At the same time, the ideas brought to China by American intellectuals, including travelers, journalists, businessmen, and educators, therefore have at least two routes as their own choices, and the Chinese must choose. Similarly, the impressions they brought back from China have since then had two faces and images, left and right, resulting from their subjective choices and subjective descriptions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The earliest schools set up by Americans in China were affiliated middle schools run by missionaries to China in churches. It is difficult for us to say which middle school was opened earliest. Peking Union Medical College is the first modern medical school in China, as well as Xiangya Medical College in Hunan, West China Union University in Sichuan, and Qilu University in Shandong, all of which were founded by missionaries from the United States. Union Medical College adopts a method of integrating modern medical education with general hospitals and has become a model in China. Their influence extends to more remote provinces, such as Mingxian College in Shanxi, which was also established by American missionaries. During the Republic of China, in addition to the above-mentioned medical teaching, famous universities such as Yanjing University, Soochow University, Jinling University, and Zhijiang University were all founded by American missionaries and contributed to the development of education in modern China. In the field of history, Yenching University&#39;s Journal of Yenching, Academia Sinica&#39;s Journal of the Institute of History and Linguistics, and Tsinghua University&#39;s Journal of Tsinghua are collectively known as the &quot;Three University Journals.&quot; To this day, Tsinghua University on both sides of the Taiwan Strait is still a very important university, especially Tsinghua University in Beijing, which is the &quot;leading&quot; university in China. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fu Jen Middle School, where I study, was built by Chinese Christians in Shanghai who returned to their hometown of Wuxi. They believe that although they are not missionaries, they still set up schools with the service spirit of devout believers and in accordance with the educational level and teaching methods of British and American middle schools. Although these teachers from Furen Middle School only trained me for two and a half years (from the first semester of high school to the first semester of high school), they had a great influence on my life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From university education to secondary education, the United States has a profound influence on China. Medicine and education were areas where missionaries focused their attention. In 1937, the American Bureau for Medical Aid to China was established. These people with ties to China were basically missionaries to China. They returned to the United States and advocated helping China during the Anti-Japanese War and donating Chinese medicine, equipment and doctors. When China was under blockade and faced extreme difficulties, plane after plane of U.S. aid supplies entered China via the &quot;hump route.&quot; This includes the newly invented penicillin, the first batch of which was shipped to China after it officially left the factory, which was of great help to China&#39;s wounded soldiers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To this day, we should be grateful to them. Many missionaries stayed in China and stayed here until their old age; many missionaries considered China their hometown, and they said &quot;my hometown is in China&quot;; many missionaries protected Chinese children, Chinese wounded soldiers, and Chinese refugees during the Anti-Japanese War. By. In the case of the Nanjing Massacre, Jinling Women&#39;s University was designated as a &quot;protected area&quot;, and thousands of Chinese women fled there to receive rescue and avoid being ravaged by the Japanese. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Such things make us deeply moved. However, we also have entanglements. In U.S. trade with China, the U.S. is almost always outperforming and China is outperforming. And it is very regrettable that the United States also played a shameful role in the early opium trade: in terms of the amount of opium transported to China, the United States was not necessarily less than the United Kingdom—the United Kingdom and the United States were the largest opium traders. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/19/nH28zc6Tg2jXZeoIuvq8661q4HgVq1t9k6cqsaER.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;700&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/19/nH28zc6Tg2jXZeoIuvq8661q4HgVq1t9k6cqsaER.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254580&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In January 1945, the first Chinese transport convoy drove through the Burma Highway. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The complex grievances between China and the United States&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The greater grievances between China and the United States Grudges appear in the middle of war. The first time the United States intervened in China&#39;s war was during the Taiping Rebellion. At that time, there were many foreigners in the Shanghai Concession, and there were also many Chinese people who fled there. In 1860, American Frederick T. Ward led the formation of a &quot;foreign gun team&quot;. This group of mercenaries was small in number and very elite. Initially to defend the Shanghai concession, he later left the concession to help Li Hongzhang&#39;s Huai army and the Hunan army Zeng Guoquan&#39;s troops. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the late Qing Dynasty, the revolution led by Dr. Sun Yat-sen used the United States as a model in its early stages - although he did not seriously understand the various internal debates and struggles after the founding of the United States of America, nor did he study the impact of the American Civil War on American politics. Institutional influence. Later, the &quot;civil rights&quot; of the &quot;Three People&#39;s Principles&quot; were only explained in general terms. But after Sun Yat-sen established his government in Guangzhou, he had a most important struggle. He got rid of the influence of the Japanese ronin &quot;Xuanyang Society&quot;, but he also gained support from the new international communism in Europe and accepted some of their ideas. More importantly, the first revolutionary army organized by Sun Yat-sen to build New China received 8,000 rifles from the Communist International in Russia in the name of Whampoa Military Academy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Sun Yat-sen&#39;s conception, the prototype of people&#39;s livelihood doctrine is &quot;land to the tiller.&quot; This is also a dream shared by the peasant revolutionary armies in Chinese history, including the aforementioned &quot;Taiping Heavenly Kingdom&quot; rebels. After the establishment of the government in Guangzhou, cooperation with the Communist International led to the emergence of opposition between the left and the right within the Kuomintang, which also fundamentally changed the connotation of his &quot;people&#39;s livelihood doctrine&quot;: &quot;People&#39;s livelihood doctrine is socialism.&quot; Sun Yat-sen&#39;s ideal Changes also caused the blueprint for the founding of the Republic of China to not only cause ideological opposition between the left and right in the future struggle between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, but also lead to opposition between important party members. After his death, the so-called &quot;Ning-Han split&quot; originated from this. The right wing led by Chiang Kai-shek has since lost the support of the Kuomintang left wing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The second time the United States intervened in China&#39;s war was during the Anti-Japanese War. At the beginning of the Anti-Japanese War, China lost 800 aircraft within a month and nearly 3,000 aircraft during the entire Anti-Japanese War. Japan had the best aircraft in the world at that time, but China did not have the ability to manufacture them. It could only buy various types of aircraft from foreign countries and form them into an air force combat force. Therefore, China&#39;s airspace was abused by the Japanese at will. When the Chinese army is fighting, the bombs falling from the sky are more helpless than the bullets on the ground. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Claire L. Chennault, an American aerial aerobatic team member, organized American aerial athletes who were not afraid of death and established a Chinese Air Force American Volunteer Group (American Volunteer Group) in a private name. &quot;Flying Tigers&quot;. Their team members are dedicated aerobatic pilots who can climb out of the cabin and walk on the wings of a flying aircraft. They can take off in farm fields, land on barn roofs, do somersaults in the air without falling, and even swing in mid-air from a rope dangled from an airplane. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At first, they used aircraft that had been retired by the U.S. Air Force. After the &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; incident, the United States entered the war and reorganized this civilian force into the Fourteenth Air Force, with Chennault as commander. Since the establishment of this aviation force, I remember that starting in 1942, we could finally sleep peacefully in Chongqing. Our troops were fighting the Japanese and were covered by aircraft in the sky. China lost thousands of pilots during the War of Resistance. Slowly, our pilots can also fly the same aircraft as those in the United States and fight side by side with the &quot;Flying Tigers&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although these athletes from the United States are not in vain: they are rewarded with five taels of gold for each mission, and ten taels of gold for shooting down a Japanese plane. Everyone returned with dozens of pounds of gold. You know, the value of gold at that time was different from today; but among these young people, there were also a large number of them who left their lives in China. It is now estimated that they lost about 400 men from 1942 to 1945. As for whether they died for wealth or for righteousness, we can ignore it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What we particularly want to mention is the commercial exchanges between China and the United States. There are banks from many countries in the concessions of Shanghai and other treaty ports, the largest of which are the &quot;bank group&quot; of the United Kingdom and the United States, especially the British HSBC and the American Citibank. HSBC is still one of the largest banks in the world, and Citibank of the United States is the most involved in China&#39;s financial operations. The reason is that China’s first finance ministers who understood modern finance were Kong Xiangxi and Song Ziwen—Song Ziwen studied at Columbia University, and Kong Xiangxi graduated from Yale University. They brought the most important banking facilities in the United States to China. Therefore, China&#39;s first central bank was designed and operated according to the Bank of America, and regarded Citibank as a friend bank. When it overdrafted, it had Citibank as its backing. Without this backing, Chiang Kai-shek&#39;s central bank would have no credibility; and the central bank was one of the most important factors in Chiang Kai-shek&#39;s rule over China - not just with his army, but with a modern financial system. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Shanghai Stock Exchange is the first international exchange in the East. Together with the Wall Street, London and Tokyo Stock Exchanges, it has become the four important world financial trading points. This operation involves China&#39;s modern finance and modern economic operations into the world economic network. Few people pay attention to this. During this period, the United States squeezed China&#39;s finances more and less often helped China&#39;s finances. But in terms of importing this system into China, it can be said that no other country in the world can import its entire financial system into other countries, and have its most important bank as its backing. After the success of the Northern Expedition, Chiang Kai-shek established China&#39;s modern government, modern industry, national industry, national defense, etc. so quickly, all of which were inseparable from the financial support behind the United States. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the other hand, because the Eight-Power Allied Forces invaded Beijing and defeated the Qing army, they obtained 450 million taels of silver compensation from China - China had a population of 450 million at that time, which was equivalent to one tael of silver per person as compensation. . This reparation was known as the &quot;Gengzi Indemnity&quot; in history. Russia and Germany accounted for the largest proportion, followed by France, Britain, Japan, the United States, Italy and other countries. Japan used this compensation and the previous Sino-Japanese War compensation for domestic business and construction, which became the largest capital for later occupying the three northeastern provinces and even launching a full-scale war of aggression against China. The United States returned part of this compensation to China as a special fund for the latter&#39;s education development; subsequently, Britain, France and other countries returned part of the compensation. Tsinghua University was established with its support. When each new national university was established, funds were allocated from the &quot;Geng Geng Fund&quot; to support its construction - this was the case for the Central University, which was restructured from Liangjiang Normal School, and for national and provincial universities in various places. Until the end, when Tsinghua University in Taiwan resumed school, it still used a very small balance of the &quot;Genggen money&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From 1909, when the United States returned part of the &quot;Boxer Grant&quot; to support China&#39;s education, to 1964, when Tsinghua University in Taiwan resumed school, the &quot;Boxer Grant&quot; continued to have an impact on Chinese education for such a long time. But to put it another way, the &quot;Gengg money&quot; is a huge debt that China has borne. This group of foreign banking syndicates lent money to China - China did not have huge funds to pay the compensation, so it could only borrow money from the World Bank syndicate to pay. When the refund comes, the original loan will still be in the World Bank Group. We can only withdraw interest and deduct what he needs for himself. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The last &quot;geng money&quot; payment was handled by my late father, Boxiang Gong, when he was transferred to the Ministry of Finance as a customs supervisor. After the unequal treaty was terminated in 1942, he was responsible for sorting out the remaining balance of the &quot;Gengg money&quot; and the method of compensation. During the difficult and difficult period of the War of Resistance, the Westerners did not forgive us this debt. My late father was about fifty years old at the time. Every time he came back at night, he would look at the accounts and feel very sad. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On December 7, 1941, Christmas Eve, Japan attacked Pearl Harbor and the United States entered the war. Finally, because of its status as an allied member, China canceled all unequal treaties. This is tantamount to lifting the burden that China has carried for decades. Since then, the relationship between the United States and China has entered a new stage. The original civilian identity of the &quot;Flying Tigers&quot; became the Fourteenth Air Force of the United States. The Chinese Expeditionary Force also went abroad from Tengchong to rescue the British army in Burma. This army was incorporated into the command sequence of the Allied Powers, the Chinese, British and American Allied Forces. The United States also sent a representative, General Joseph Stilwell, as the chief of staff of the Chinese theater. Stilwell wanted to be the commander-in-chief of the Chinese theater and command the entire Chinese army, but Chiang Kai-shek disagreed. Since then, the U.S. military has intervened in China&#39;s military, and there have been endless grievances and resentments. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the last two years of the Anti-Japanese War, American aircraft flew over the &quot;Hump Route&quot; to transport supplies to China and also provided aircraft for the Chinese Air Force via this route. On land, the Stilwell Highway, the road from India to China via Myanmar, was also opened, and truckloads of supplies entered China, all under the command of Stilwell. China needs his permission to call in these troops. When the Chinese army is fighting on the front line and every second counts, it often misses the opportunity because it needs to see the battle plan. On a battlefield thousands of miles away, the battle situation is changing rapidly. How to provide a battle plan? This makes the last stage of China&#39;s battle still very difficult because there are people on the side who are restricting it. Of course, in the last battle in Changde, if American military planes had not transported reinforcements from afar to Changde, we would not have been able to stop the Japanese from marching in. This was a very significant help provided by the United States to China during the Anti-Japanese War. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Chinese part of the Stilwell Highway was dug by hand in the mountains of Yunnan by villagers from various ethnic groups. More than 2,000 trucks entered China from Myanmar. In fact, the United States donated about 4,000 trucks to China. Half of them overturned on the Stilwell Highway.这些车都是由马来西亚、菲律宾、新加坡等地的华侨青年，到缅甸投军、作为志愿者开进来的——他们没学过驾驶这种车，两千多人永远留在了山沟里。他们本想回祖国帮助抗战，却连祖国的土地都未曾踏足。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在抗战初期，为了争取美国的援助，国民政府驻美大使胡适在全美各地作了五六十次讲演。蒋介石夫人宋美龄女士也特地在美国国会发表讲演，使美国人对中国的印象，摆脱了中国劳工在美的形象。同时，美国的记者以及作家，尤其赛珍珠（Pearl S.Buck）和《时代》《生活》杂志的发行人路斯（Henry Luce，汉名路思义），不断向美国公众介绍中国在苦难之中的挣扎。另一方面，中国北方在日本的战线向西推进时，八路军派往敌后的干部掌握了农村。在那些地区的美国传教士以及访华人员，后来又包括美国大使馆、领事馆的职员谢伟思（John S.Service）等人，将北方的消息传送到美国。其中，斯诺（Edgar Snow）的新闻报道，具有无可估量的影响力。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这种舆论的分歧，再加上史迪威和蒋介石之间的对抗，使得中美之间在第二次世界大战最后一段的关系与配合，发生重要的冲突。二战以后，美国紧接着出现了“麦卡锡主义”，造成美国内部左右之间的严重分裂。那一裂痕，又导致了所谓“谁丢失了中国”的辩论。更进一步，美国以同样的心态，回头看二战后的欧洲。苏联的崛起与中国的国共内战，导致二战后近二十年，美国对自己领导的世界及与此相关的外交政策，都趋向对共产主义国家的抵制和围堵。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;抗战结束后，国共内战开始，美国莫名其妙地纠缠其中。美国派遣外交官谢伟思等人组成的“迪克西使团”(Dixie Mission)参观延安，他们回来说：延安是未来的希望，重庆是黑暗的地方；重庆是要没落的，延安要起来；帮延安，不要帮重庆。这其间的恩恩怨怨，我们很难说。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;（深圳行政学院副教授陈新华整理）&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 19 Oct 2023 21:25:04 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
