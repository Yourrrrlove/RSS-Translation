This time, her voice arrived In the ears of tens of thousands of people. On the construction site where the machines are roaring, she is silent most of the time. When faced with the foreman&#39;s scolding, she just pretends not to hear it and sometimes has to smile. With only one square meter in the cab, she would listen to her favorite music and sing loudly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/DNEXw9iOruxL22YwlzaDlFPOCgz64j52FhUkjWP6.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/DNEXw9iOruxL22YwlzaDlFPOCgz64j52FhUkjWP6.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254358&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Women are in the minority among those who operate excavators. As one of them, Wang Chunyan’s experience is special. The picture shows the scene of drying chili peppers in Jiuquan, Gansu Province in September 2023. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the collection of stories on the theme of &quot;My achievements have nothing to do with gender&quot; was issued, Kou Aizhe received a large number of submissions , he was first attracted by Wang Chunyan’s message, although she only briefly expressed that as a woman, “the excavator makes me very proud.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xiaoye, who is studying for graduate school in France, entered the podcast process as a narrator, which was full of drama. She learned that her father, whom she had not seen for many years, passed away in Cambodia. She wanted to go there, but she did not dare to leave rashly. She happened to find a podcast episode in which a Chinese man in Cambodia, Santiao, told his story about a foreign country. She finally contacted him through a message. With care, Xiaoye completed the &quot;journey to find his father&quot; with peace of mind, and later accepted the invitation to participate in the podcast recording with this story. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On Xiaoyushu App, Xiaoye’s story has become one of the three most popular programs among all podcasts. This kind of spread effect was expected by the host Da Meng. What he didn’t expect was that as a Content workers can help some people solve real-life problems while making programs. This is the biggest healing and encouragement Xiaoye&#39;s story brings to him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Song Xinran listened to his podcast outside the massage parlor where he worked. He was embarrassed to listen in front of his colleagues and felt that his voice was unpleasant. When he told his story, there was something &quot;very hard to explain&quot;. He is a blind marathon runner. In the show, he said: &quot;As long as you run, you can create the wind.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Kou Aizhe and Dameng are the owners of two podcasts - Story FM and Genius respectively. Founder and anchor of Catcher FM. Story FM passed its seventh birthday, and Genius Catcher FM was born at the end of 2019. The former&#39;s guest self-narration format has become a signature, while the latter uses interviews to capture the inspiration of all kinds of life. The content narrators of podcasts are often industry experts, scholars, and media people, and these two podcasts provide a stage for lay people to talk and express themselves, and amplify their voices. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/djz1BWwVeyn3H4uCHyx0M6YiDijOez8Jk340CNkQ.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height= &quot;683&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/djz1BWwVeyn3H4uCHyx0M6YiDijOez8Jk340CNkQ.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254360&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;There are currently relatively few Chinese podcasts where amateurs tell stories. The picture is a creative picture. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;They host almost the only large-scale witness story podcast in China. Dameng saw that the podcast platform classified the two into the story category, which is not a problem in itself. What is strange is that other podcasts in the same category tell ghost stories and historical stories. &quot;They are not the same &#39;storytelling&#39;.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;From listener to narrator&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Wang Chunyan had been listening to Story FM for five years before she opened her mouth to tell the story. At first, she was attracted by the eye-catching title of Story FM, but gradually she felt that it suited her very well, as it was an &quot;unconcealed, spiritual communication program that directly faces people&#39;s hearts.&quot; She is particularly interested in stories involving life, death and human emotions, and is keenly aware that the program &quot;focuses on more vulnerable groups.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When she saw Story FM’s call for submissions to collect stories about women in gender-imbalanced industries, Wang Chunyan had a lot to say. &quot;As a female excavator master, I don&#39;t know if I have a firm foothold, but I have persisted for more than ten years and I feel quite proud.&quot; She left a message, &quot;I didn&#39;t expect Ai Zhe to really see it.&quot;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;When the epidemic broke out, Xiaoye developed the habit of listening to podcasts. She described that she had some obsessive-compulsive disorder at the time. After discovering Genius Catcher FM, she listened to every program from the beginning. Xiaoye, who already likes to listen to different life stories, is like finding a treasure. He keeps listening to it until now. The program invited many people from all walks of life to tell their career stories. She was deeply impressed by the psychiatrist Chen Baiyou among them, because what she told was very touching and different from the public perception. &quot;She said that only kind people will suffer from mental illness, which touched me very much.&quot; Xiaoye told Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xiaoye’s parents went to Cambodia to work together. She was also born in Cambodia. After her parents divorced, her mother took Xiaoye back to China to develop, while her father stayed in Cambodia. In June 2022, Xiaoye learned about her father&#39;s death through relatives. On Father&#39;s Day a week later, she sent her blessings to her father&#39;s WeChat, but she did not expect a response from the other party. A strange Cambodian woman contacted Xiaoye and claimed to be her father&#39;s partner. Later, she invited Xiaoye to Phnom Penh to participate in her father&#39;s 100-day festival. When she was hesitating whether to go there, she happened to see Genius Catcher FM&#39;s push &quot;I collected corpses for Chinese people in Cambodia, but I didn&#39;t dare to show the faces of the corpses to their families.&quot; She left messages for Dameng on various platforms, hoping to get to know the narrator, Santiao, and Dameng set up a connection between the two. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sanjou said to Xiaoye: &quot;Just come, I will pick you up at the airport.&quot; As soon as she left the airport gate, Xiaoye saw the woman holding a photo of her father, but she always felt that she would just go with this stranger , feeling panicked. At this time, Sanjou appeared. He grabbed Xiaoye&#39;s suitcase and protected her from behind. On the first day of Xiaoye&#39;s arrival, Sanjou drove with him all the way, and even called his girlfriend, who could speak English and Cambodian, to act as a translator for Xiaoye. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xiaoye bought an urn at the local market and took away part of his father&#39;s ashes. Among his father&#39;s belongings, there was a small box containing several photos with Xiaoye. Xiaoye also discovered that although he had not seen his father since his second year in junior high school, his passport still had records of entering China several times. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After Xiaoye returned to daily life, Dameng chatted with her for an hour or two and recorded this life experience. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;His father was absent when Xiaoye was growing up. Whether it was on the phone or via WeChat, Xiaoye felt that he could not truly communicate with each other. But within just two or three days of staying in a foreign land, Xiaoye realized that his father had been thinking about him. From a group of strange Cambodian people, she heard her relatives call her: baby, with an exaggerated pronunciation and mouth shape, which was unique to her father. She thought about how many times her father had to say it before everyone around him remembered it. Some listeners shed tears after hearing this detail. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/N6yoBn0rYEuKFsOCqtCknUHP4Y8clT3ww87UIy03.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/N6yoBn0rYEuKFsOCqtCknUHP4Y8clT3ww87UIy03.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254359&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The stories of the Chinese in Cambodia have been made into a series of podcasts, including the story of Xiaoye going to participate in his father&#39;s 100-day festival. The picture shows the Day of the Dead in Phnom Penh, Cambodia in October 2023. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Chunyan has been driving excavators for more than ten years. When she talked about taking hormones to gain weight in order to collect bills more easily and avoid being sexually harassed, Kou Aizhe was shocked and confirmed again, did you really take hormones to gain weight? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are many inconveniences for women working as excavators, such as the lack of toilets at the construction site. For this reason, Wang Chunyan would leave home at around 5 a.m. and get off work at around 8 p.m. without taking a sip of water. Sometimes she couldn&#39;t hold it in any longer, so she would dig a hole for emergencies. Not many people can persist. Wang Chunyan has built a &quot;National Queen Group&quot;, which has 99 female excavator operators, roughly 1/3 of which have mature skills. She has accepted three female apprentices, and they either changed careers or started working on their own. When you are the boss, you no longer do it yourself. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Chunyan persisted mainly to make money. Doing other jobs cannot support this family. When she was 16 years old, her abducted sister returned home nine months pregnant. Both her mother and sister suffer from mental illness, and her father-in-law is careless. The family&#39;s livelihood depends entirely on Wang Chunyan. Later, her husband was in a car accident and became a vegetative state. After he woke up and was discharged from the hospital paralyzed, he owed a large amount of medical expenses, which Wang Chunyan has been paying over the years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;More than two months after the podcast was released, many listeners left messages and were moved by her tenacity, courage, and optimism. Wang Chunyan didn&#39;t pay much attention to this feedback. She was working every day in the past few days and &quot;didn&#39;t stop to review those things.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Speak out your worries and hear new knowledge&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Wang Chunyan has never told her family about the hardships she experienced outside. Her sister, mother, and husband are all patients. Her parents-in-law have never wanted to see her because of her family background. She, there was almost no emotional communication between the two parties. &quot;I don&#39;t have an outlet to vent. Sometimes I feel very depressed and want a space to talk.&quot; Talking about her life in the podcast fulfilled her wish to talk. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Kou Aizhe understands this mentality very well, “Everyone needs to tell something that has been buried in his heart for a long time, or some obstacles that he cannot get over, or he is confused about this matter and wants to hear some people’s opinions. Feedback, but he may not want people around him to hear it, for example, he cannot accept these people judging him.&quot; Some of the more secretive stories are basically from the narrator&#39;s initiative. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During the interview, if the narrator states that he does not want certain details to be disclosed, such as name, city, and industry, they will be blurred. This protection of anonymity also gives the narrator more courage. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;It&#39;s anonymous anyway, no one knows who I am, so I can say whatever I want.&quot; Xiaoye received Da Meng&#39;s recording invitation and readily agreed. She was very happy to be on the podcast she often listens to. , at the same time, she felt that this story was &quot;quite bizarre, outrageous, and worth telling&quot; and wanted to share it with more people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Dameng’s view, recording a podcast is a process in which the narrator and the producer complement each other. &quot;Sometimes people experience some legendary things and want to record them. Some people are willing to write and some are willing to talk about it. It is also important for the guests to record their own experiences on our program. Let me help them complete it. Content editor.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Because everyone&#39;s life is boring and they are curious about what other people live, so they especially like to listen to such stories. For me, this is a way to see the world. The window is mainly for fun.&quot; Xiaoye explained why people love to listen to stories told by another ordinary person so much. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For producers, the fun of doing programs is largely due to the ability to gain new knowledge and broaden their cognitive boundaries. When I first started doing a series of stories about Cambodian characters, almost every issue would refresh Da Meng’s understanding. The narrators all live in Phnom Penh and Sihanoukville, Cambodia, helping Chinese people in trouble in foreign lands. Santiao was the first one to share on the show. He volunteered to help Chinese people who died accidentally in Cambodia, process and cremate their bodies, and transport them back to China. Later, Dameng interviewed Jie Ge and Aaron one after another. They used their own methods to protect the Chinese wandering in Cambodia or guide them on their way home. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Beijing Long Distance Running Festival in April 2023 made Dameng pay attention to He Yajun’s Blind Assistance Group. After contacting several blind runners in the group, he chose Song Xinran as the subject of his story. The theme of the program is about &quot;wind&quot;. Every Wednesday and Saturday morning, Song Xinran runs with nearly a hundred teammates in the Beijing Olympic Forest Park, passing through flowers, bamboo forests, and ponds. The blind friend and the running aid volunteer are connected by a running aid rope for the blind. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/v5xWL54vReWbjIi8ol9nJ4E7jtFpQz3b2eNNqLOk.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;639&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/v5xWL54vReWbjIi8ol9nJ4E7jtFpQz3b2eNNqLOk.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254357&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Song Xinran, a blind man, talked about his experience in long-distance running. The picture shows a blind running rope connecting a blind marathon runner (left) and a volunteer guiding him (right) in Tai&#39;an, Shandong in 2017. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The competition that Song Xinran is most proud of is the 2019 Beijing Long Distance Running Festival. He ran hard and ran within the prescribed time. He crossed the finish line and won the qualification for his runner to pass through to the &quot;Northern Marathon&quot; competition. Running has become an indispensable part of Song Xinran&#39;s life. The customers who come for massage are also infected by him and start practicing running. Sometimes when talking about pace, they praise it, it’s so fast. You have bad eyesight and you can run faster than us. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Story FM has also invited some blind narrators. Although everyone has their own interests and hobbies, when it comes to employment, most of them can only go for massages. In a later episode, a group of blind employees from Xiaomi in Shanghai were invited to talk about how they worked as markers and trained the AI ​​Xiao Ai classmates. A blind listener in Xi&#39;an listened to the program and kept sending messages to Kou Aizhe, telling him how the program inspired him. Kou Aizhe witnessed his changes little by little. The latest news was that he came to report good news: Xiaomi was recruiting blind people to do similar work in Xi&#39;an, and he successfully applied. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Listening to strangers’ stories sometimes has such a direct impact on the audience that they respond in their own lives. As the popularity of the program increased, Dameng discovered that many listeners regarded Genius Catcher FM as a career guide. A program by a space organizer inspired several listeners to start engaging in related work. A person passed the police civil service examination and sent a private message saying that he was not a police major. After listening to the program, he yearned for the honor and experience of this profession and had a belief. I was so moved and frightened that I turned on the program and listened to it again, &quot;Don&#39;t say anything nonsense.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Let different people &quot;penetrate each other&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Xiaoye likes to listen to podcasts in the shower and while commuting. Chatting podcasts rank first in her mind. “They are the kind where the host is chatting, and you listen and feel like you can join in, so you can’t help but join in the discussion.” One time while commuting, she heard something funny and stopped to stamp her feet on the street and burst into laughter. Life seemed to have a different color because her ears were plugged and she couldn&#39;t hear the sounds outside. At that moment, she felt happy and contented, &quot;This is my world.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When operating an excavator, if the construction site is large enough, has a good view, and the work is not too tight, Wang Chunyan will turn on the stereo and listen to something. Only in the one-square-meter cab of the excavator can she have some time of her own. The rest of the time belongs to others. &quot;Coming home is like fighting a war.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Chunyan also plays Douyin. Among the bloggers she follows, there are many ideological ones, but she believes that &quot;Douyin is just a kind of fast food, and the real nutritious meal is podcasts.&quot; Podcasts arouse her deep understanding. There is more to think about than short videos. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A podcast episode is usually tens of minutes long, or even as long as two or three hours. Unlike short videos and other content, Dameng pointed out that the main value that podcasts, long-form content that focuses on reality, can bring to listeners is &quot;companionship and recognition.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He interviewed the founders of transgender groups, social workers who helped female domestic workers, and niche professional or hobby groups, trying to reflect the situation of a group of people through their narration of their fate and experiences, and make many people who originally felt People who are very lonely are no longer so lonely. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In podcasts where amateurs tell stories, the narrator’s expressive ability is not that important. Dameng believes that the value of stories to people, the scarcity of information, and the desire of guests to share are all more important than the ability to express themselves. Kou Aizhe bluntly said that the so-called ability to express well is actually a privilege. What Story FM wants to do is to break it rather than strengthen it. &quot;Those who are not so eloquent in expression have very good stories and very good experiences, but they It is a pity to remain silent.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Kou Aizhe interviewed a contributor, a female worker on the assembly line. For many years, she tried to take her children with her and live with her in the city, but she encountered obstacles everywhere. Later, she also tried to return to her hometown. Find a job, but there are no good jobs in my hometown to support my family and give my children a better life. Although her education level is not high and her expression is simple and unpretentious, she resonates with many parents from middle-class families in first-tier cities. Parents&#39; love and devotion to their children and the struggles in raising children are common. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“I don’t want people to use a certain label to evaluate a person. This may be what my story wants to show.” Kou Aizhe wants to use the podcast to let people of different classes or classes People &quot;penetrate each other&quot;, understand what their respective lives are like, and have a better understanding. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Chunyan once listened to the program &quot;Behind the 50 million blind date game, do billionaires still believe in love&quot; with curiosity. She concluded, &quot;The basic characteristics of us as a person are sincerity and sincerity, whether he is a multi-millionaire or an ordinary citizen. &lt;span>;&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt; p>; &quot;Whether it is a short video, or some short posts, pictures and texts, we will soon get a conclusion, but in the podcast, we can follow the people who have experienced it and retrace this person&#39;s growth and experience. , you will find that there is complexity behind everything and everyone.&quot; Dameng told Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;Just see this side of me&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Song Xinran&#39;s podcast was forwarded to the running group by the captain. His teammates praised him and told stories that were very true. I hope he will do it again in the future. I can hear the story told by him himself. He also mentioned in the podcast how he and his girlfriend met and fell in love. The two trained together in a running group and gradually developed a relationship. On the day he confessed his love, he hugged his girlfriend. Someone in the group heard it and teased, &quot;Young people today are so courageous. We didn&#39;t dare to do that back then.&quot; After listening to the show, his girlfriend also blamed Song Xinran for &quot;talking about the two of them&quot; So straightforward.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xiaoye listened to that episode of her show to her friends. Several friends she was not familiar with sent her long essays on WeChat. The central idea was comfort and praise, &quot;You did a really good job with me.&quot; Goodbye&quot;. Xiaoye likes to ask friends who have listened to it, did you cry &lt;span>;? &lt;/span>;When the other party said he was crying, Xiaoye thought, &quot;Okay, I feel like I have earned something.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Chunyan is very low-key about recording podcasts, and her daughter is the only one she shares with. During the three years when Wang Chunyan accompanied her husband to the hospital in Zhejiang, her daughter was sent back to her hometown in Hubei. When she was in elementary school, she was bullied on campus and suffered from depression. She has always been rebellious and rarely communicated with her parents. Wang Chunyan didn&#39;t know how her daughter felt specifically after hearing this, because she didn&#39;t say anything and didn&#39;t contact him until a day later. But from then on, her daughter became willing to chat with Wang Chunyan and became more concerned about her. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the trip to Cambodia, Xiaoye said nothing to his relatives, including his mother, and naturally did not let them know about the podcast he had recorded. Father is a topic that Xiaoye and her mother tacitly avoid talking about. Xiaoye also doesn’t want her mother to know that she went to Cambodia: “On the one hand, because she is a bit controlling, I still act like a more obedient daughter most of the time. , I will try my best to listen to her opinion on such a big matter. She told me very seriously before that she didn’t want me to go, but out of my own stubbornness, I went anyway. And I didn’t really want her to know that she was There is another lady in Cambodia who lives with my dad, and I don’t want her to be away from my dad for so long and have to think about my dad’s affairs.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, Xiaoye also hopes that her mother will find out about this. Maybe the two of them will be more open to talking about it. Xiaoye decided not to tell her proactively, and recording the podcast was like burying a clue. Maybe she would find it, and maybe it would become a secret forever. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Story FM invites producers to conduct a &quot;year-end summary&quot; in 2022. One of the producers mentioned that when he was producing a program, he was so moved by a confession from the interviewee that he thought of ending the program with this paragraph. However, the interviewee then asked: &quot;How is it? I So it can arouse the audience&#39;s emotions, right?&quot; The producer suddenly realized that even interviews that pursue documentary often only enlarge the fragments of a person&#39;s life, so he wanted to remind the audience: don&#39;t care so much. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the first few days after the show aired, Xiaoye paid attention to the comments. When she saw someone saying that they really wanted to follow Xiaoye&#39;s Weibo, she thought to herself, please don&#39;t. &quot;When you listen to my story, this is one side of me, but if you really pay attention to my life, it&#39;s the other side. People are multi-faceted. Just see this side of me. I don&#39;t want to show it in all directions. I don’t like it in front of the public.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The podcast condenses a small part of their life memories, and the real life continues, which is far more complicated than the story being told. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Chunyan said in the program that she made a wish in front of Bodhisattva at that time. If her husband wakes up, she is willing to give him half of his life span and only live to 50 years old. She will reach this age in a few years, and she hopes to travel and live a life for herself. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In reality, Wang Chunyan, in addition to her passion and bravery, also has a level of sobriety and coldness that has been polished by her circumstances. She believes, &quot;I have seen too many things in the world, and it is of no use to live so much. Living to 50 years old is enough.&quot; When she went to the mental hospital to visit her sister, she no longer recognized her, and she needed others to hand her water and food before she could eat. She thought, in that state, what role did maintaining her sister&#39;s life play? It was just to make herself, a relative, feel at ease. She has read &quot;Dream of Red Mansions&quot; countless times, and is no stranger to the illusion of life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the end of the interview, she suddenly asked the Southern Weekend reporter whether bone marrow donation (commonly known as hematopoietic stem cell donation) would have any impact on the donor&#39;s health. She had applied for a voluntary donation of hematopoietic stem cells, and recently had an initial meeting with a patient. The match was successful, but my daughter disagreed. If it does not affect her work, she still hopes to contribute: &quot;A life is waiting, and it would be too cruel not to save it.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: 毷体, 毷体_GB2312 , STKaiti;&quot;>;(Xiaoye and Santiao are pseudonyms in the article)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 20 Oct 2023 11:25:03 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[最高法发布国家公园司法保护典型案例]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258840]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-20 10:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data-mpa-powered-by=&quot;yiban.io&quot;>;&lt;span>;National parks are the most important in our country Natural ecological space is the most important part of the natural ecosystem, with the most unique natural landscape, the most essential natural heritage, and the richest biodiversity. The establishment of a national park system is something that General Secretary Xi Jinping personally planned, deployed, and promoted as a &quot;big man in the country.&quot; Since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core has stood at the strategic height of realizing the sustainable development of the Chinese nation and made a series of major strategic arrangements to promote the establishment of a national park system and accelerate the construction of natural protection with national parks as the main body. system, and effectively strengthen the protection of natural ecology. On October 12, 2021, President Xi Jinping announced at the 15th Leaders’ Summit of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity that my country has officially established the Sanjiangyuan, giant pandas, Siberian tigers and leopards, Hainan tropical rainforests, Wuyi Mountains, etc. The approval of the national park marks that this major innovative system of national parks has taken root and the construction of national parks has entered a new level. In November 2022, my country issued the &quot;National Park Spatial Layout Plan&quot;, which clarified the work process, main construction tasks and implementation safeguards for the establishment of national parks, selected 49 national park candidate areas, and outlined a plan for building the world&#39;s largest national park. The grand blueprint of the system. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The construction of high-quality national parks is an important part of the construction of my country&#39;s ecological civilization system. It is important for promoting the scientific protection and rational utilization of natural resources, promoting the harmonious coexistence of man and nature, and promoting a beautiful China. Construction is of extremely important significance. In recent years, the People&#39;s Court has always adhered to the guidance of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, deeply implemented Xi Jinping Thought on the Rule of Law and Xi Jinping Thought on Ecological Civilization, and thoroughly implemented the concept of dynamic judiciary.

Case 5: Wang Min and six others were involved in a criminal incidental public interest litigation case of indiscriminate logging of trees and endangering nationally protected plants, and case 9: Zhang Mouyan and Zhang Mouyi sued the Yangxian County Forestry Bureau over the right to life dispute. The People&#39;s Court found during the trial that We do not use mechanical justice to solve the loopholes and shortcomings in the management of national parks. Instead, we actively extend the environmental resources adjudication function, actively integrate into the process of ecological civilization construction, issue judicial suggestions to administrative departments, and urge relevant departments to identify and fill vacancies. It is a vivid practice of active justice. The third is to adhere to the concept of integrated protection and systematic governance. Case 3: The case of environmental pollution by Yang and other three persons, which reflects the people&#39;s court&#39;s strengthening of the management of environmental pollution in the area adjacent to the Giant Panda National Park; Case 4: Li and 11 other persons endangering precious and endangered wild animals, criminal incidental civil public interest litigation , the People&#39;s Court launched a full-chain crackdown on the &quot;hunting-acquisition-transportation-sales&quot; link of crimes that endanger precious and endangered wild animals, which is a vivid practice of integrated protection and systematic governance.

Case 4: Li Mouhua and 11 other persons were involved in a civil public interest litigation incidental to the crime of endangering precious and endangered wild animals. This case was implemented against criminals who are zoo operators in order to prevent them from taking advantage of the convenient conditions for acquiring, raising, selling, and transporting wild animals. For such crimes, the People&#39;s Court imposed a &quot;prohibition order&quot; on them, which reflects the concept of preventive justice. Sixth, properly handle the relationship between people&#39;s livelihood, development and protection. Case 2: In the case of Zhang Mouqiang’s illegal manufacturing of guns and illegal hunting, probation was applied to local villagers who had just escaped from poverty to prevent families who had just escaped from poverty from returning to poverty due to punishment, and better balanced the relationship between ecological environment protection and people’s livelihood security.

Illegal mining cases of Zheng Moucheng, Gao Moujin and Ye Moudong&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;span >;[Basic facts of the case]&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The defendant Zheng Moucheng jointly contracted with others the forest land located in a mountain farm in Luanfeng Township, Guangze County, Fujian Province. The mountain farm is located within the scope of Wuyishan National Park . Zheng Moucheng and the defendant Gao Moucheng became friends, and the two planned to jointly mine rare earths for profit in the mountain farm. From September 2016 to May 2017, Zheng Moucheng and Gao Mojin organized Feng Mouan, Zhong Mouming (all handled in separate cases) and defendant Ye Moudong and others to go to the mine without a mining license. The mountain farm mines rare earth minerals by digging caves in the mountain, injecting ammonium sulfate, etc., and then precipitating the precipitated liquid. 9,300 kilograms of suspected rare earth semi-finished products were seized on site. After identification, the rare earth minerals involved in the case are all ion-adsorbed rare earths, which are specific mineral types stipulated by the state for protective mining. The illegal mining behavior of Zheng Moucheng and others also caused damage to the mineral resources of rare earth mineral sites. In addition, it was also found that Ye Moudong had a dispute and fight with others over trivial matters in March 2018, and was guilty of intentional injury causing minor injuries. Guangze County, Fujian Province prosecuted Zheng Moucheng, Gao Mojin, and Ye Moudong for illegal mining, and Ye Moudong for intentional injury. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;[Judgment Result]&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;After trial, the People’s Court of Guangze County, Fujian Province held that the defendants Zheng Moucheng and Gao Moumou Jin, Ye Moudong and others violated the provisions of the Mineral Resources Law and exploited the ion adsorption rare earth mineral of a specific mineral type that the state implements protective mining without a mining license. The circumstances were particularly serious and constituted the crime of illegal mining. Zheng Moucheng and Gao Jin are the principal offenders, and Ye Moudong is an accessory. Zheng Moucheng and Gao Moujin were sentenced to four years and nine months in prison respectively for the crime of illegal mining and fined 150,000 yuan. Ye Moudong was sentenced to three years in prison for the crime of illegal mining and intentional injury. year, and be fined 100,000 yuan; the rare earth semi-finished products seized will be confiscated. After the verdict was pronounced, the defendant Gao Moujin refused to accept the verdict and filed an appeal. The second instance ruling of Nanping Intermediate People&#39;s Court of Fujian Province dismissed the appeal and upheld the original judgment. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;[Typical significance]&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Wuyishan National Park is currently the only one in my country that is both a world man and biosphere reserve and a The national park, a world cultural and natural heritage, contains numerous non-renewable and valuable mineral resources. Among them, rare earths are important strategic resources for our country and are key elements in emerging industries, high-end manufacturing, and modern national defense science and technology industry. In recent years, criminal acts of illegal mining of rare earths have occurred in the areas around Wuyishan National Park, damaging the country&#39;s rare earth resource reserves and seriously threatening the security of the national park&#39;s environmental resources. The defendant in this case mined rare earth minerals using the in-situ leaching method, which endangered the ecological service functions and ecosystem stability of Wuyishan National Park, and easily led to vegetation destruction, mountain exposure, water source pollution, soil erosion, landslides, ground cracks and subsidence, etc. Serious consequences occur. When the value of the mined mineral products and the value of the damage caused to the mineral resources have been ascertained, the people&#39;s court determined that the defendant&#39;s illegal mining behavior was particularly serious based on the value of the damage caused to the mineral resources, and severely punished the crime of illegal mining of rare earths in accordance with the law. Strict punishment within the penalty range and strict control over the application of suspended sentences will help ensure the development and utilization of national strategic resources and protect the ecological security of national parks. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;span>;&lt;strong>;2. Zhang Mouqiang’s illegal manufacturing of firearms and illegal hunting case&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;[Basic case facts 】&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;During 2017, the defendant Zhang Mouqiang went to a hardware store in Haikou City, Hainan Province to buy a nail gun, a barrel, iron sand, and nail bullets. , using its own tools to assemble a gun-shaped object. After identification, the gun-shaped object manufactured by Zhang Mouqiang was a gun that used gunpowder as its firing power. In the early morning of March 21, 2022, Zhang Mouqiang entered the Bawangling Branch of Hainan Tropical Rainforest National Park, which is designated as a protected hunting area, without permission from the wildlife administrative department, and without a hunting license or a gun license. During the hunting at the flood management station, a total of 3 red-bellied squirrels, 1 coconut cat, and 1 ferret badger were hunted using guns, and 30 big green stink frogs were hunted using headlights. Zhang Mouqiang was caught on the spot by the public security police on his way down the mountain the next day. After identification, the coconut cat involved in the case is a national second-level protected wild animal. The ferret badger and red-bellied squirrel are included in the &quot;List of Terrestrial Wild Animals Protected by the State as Beneficial or of Important Economic and Scientific Research Value.&quot; The smelly frog belongs to Hainan. The province focuses on protecting terrestrial wildlife. The Second Branch of the Hainan Provincial People&#39;s Procuratorate prosecuted Zhang for illegally manufacturing firearms and illegal hunting. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;[Judgment Result]&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Hainan Provincial No. 2 Intermediate People’s Court held after trial that Zhang’s violent behavior constituted illegality The crimes of manufacturing firearms and illegal hunting should be punished concurrently. As a villager living in a national park area who has just emerged from poverty, Zhang Mouqiang still needs time to explore to change the local traditional production and lifestyle and take the road of green development to improve people&#39;s livelihood. Zhang Mouqiang is the main labor force in his family. His detention is not in compliance with the modesty principle of the criminal law and may also return his family to poverty. The authority of the law lies in the inevitability of punishment rather than its severity. When lighter punishment can be used to achieve the purpose of sanction, there is no need to use severe sanctions. In view of the fact that Zhang Mouqiang was a first-time offender, he truthfully confessed his crime after the incident, pleaded guilty and accepted punishment, and showed remorse. His place of residence was willing to cooperate with community corrections, and it was declared that the suspended sentence would have no major adverse impact on the community where he lived. The verdict was then given: Zhang Mouqiang was punished for several crimes, and it was decided to execute a three-year prison sentence, suspended for five years, and confiscate criminal tools. After the verdict was announced, the parties did not appeal or protest, and the first-instance judgment has become legally effective. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;[Typical significance]&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In April 2022, General Secretary Xi Jinping clearly pointed out that tropical rainforest countries The park is a national treasure, a reservoir, a grain depot, a money storehouse, and even a carbon storehouse. It requires strict protection of the tropical rainforest to achieve the unity of ecological protection, green development, and improvement of people&#39;s livelihood. Although the protection of environmental resources continues to increase during the construction of the Hainan Tropical Rainforest National Park, harmful use of tropical rainforest and biodiversity resources by indigenous villagers near the national park still occurs from time to time. In this case, the defendant violated hunting regulations and used modified guns and other tools for hunting in the game reserve, which destroyed the value of wild animal resources and should be subject to criminal sanctions. At the same time, the people&#39;s court fully considered the individual factors of the defendant, gave him the opportunity to rehabilitate, and applied suspended sentences to prevent families who had just escaped from poverty from returning to poverty due to punishment, demonstrated the humanistic care of the judiciary, and achieved the purpose of combining punishment and crime prevention. , and also better balances the relationship between ecological environment protection and people&#39;s livelihood security. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;span>;&lt;strong>;3. Case of environmental pollution by Yang and three others&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;[Basic case facts]&lt; /span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;From June to September 2020, the defendants Yang, Qu Moumin, and Gao Hu did not obtain a hazardous waste business license and did not take ground protection measures. , in the mountain forest of a village in Huaping Town, Anzhou District, Mianyang City, Sichuan Province, adjacent to the Giant Panda National Park protection area, 14.53 tons of waste engine oil grids were crushed and disposed using crushers and other equipment, and scrap iron and waste engine oil were separated and Sale. The three defendants made an illegal profit of 26,450 yuan from selling scrap iron and more than 6,000 yuan from selling waste engine oil. The Mianyang Municipal Ecological Environment Bureau determined that the waste oil grid involved in the case was a filter adsorption medium containing or contaminated with waste engine oil. It was included in the &quot;National Hazardous Waste List&quot;, with waste category HW49 and waste code 900-041-49, and was classified as hazardous waste. . After evaluation, the highest concentration of petroleum hydrocarbons in the soil of the plot involved in the case is 3080mg/Kg, which exceeds the screening value for the first type of land in Table 1 of the &quot;Soil Environmental Quality Standards for Soil Pollution Risk Management and Control of Construction Land (Trial)&quot; (GB36600-2018), and it is determined The land is contaminated by petroleum hydrocarbons, and this illegal production has caused damage to the soil ecological environment of the land. The three defendants all surrendered, voluntarily pleaded guilty and punished, signed a recognizance, and voluntarily returned the illegal income of 33,000 yuan. The People&#39;s Procuratorate of Anzhou District, Mianyang City, Sichuan Province launched a public prosecution against Yang, Qu and Gao for the crime of environmental pollution. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;[Judgment Result]&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;After hearing, the People’s Court of Anzhou District, Mianyang City, Sichuan Province held that Yang and Qu Min and Gao Hu violated national regulations and illegally disposed of hazardous waste, seriously polluting the environment and constituting the crime of environmental pollution. The three defendants committed a joint crime, and their criminal roles were equal, without distinguishing between the principal and the accomplice; the three defendants voluntarily surrendered and truthfully confessed their crimes, so they surrendered, and may be given a lighter or reduced punishment in accordance with the law; the three defendants voluntarily confessed and accepted punishment, and may be treated leniently ; The three defendants who voluntarily return all their illegal gains may be given a lighter punishment as appropriate.

They were also fined 15,000 yuan each, and their illegal gains of 33,000 yuan were confiscated (already recovered). After the verdict was announced, the parties did not appeal or protest, and the first-instance judgment has become legally effective. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;[Typical meaning]&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Forest soil is the material basis for the development of forestry production. In recent years, some lawless elements, motivated by profit, have invaded mountain farm forest land, illegally recycled waste engine oil, and dumped toxic and harmful substances, causing serious damage to forest land soil and its accompanying crops, disrupting the ecological balance of the forest, and harming public interests. The place where this case occurred is adjacent to the Giant Panda National Park protection area. Since the waste engine oil pollution medium is fluid and migratory, the environmental pollution incident caused by waste engine oil should not only be based on the boundaries of the national park, but also the borders of the national parks. Comprehensive and integrated regional protection. In this case, the People&#39;s Court punished criminal acts that polluted the environment in accordance with the law, comprehensively strengthened the protection of environmental resources, adhered to the harmonious coexistence of man and nature, and practiced the concept that clear waters and lush mountains are valuable assets. In order to accelerate the formation of green development methods, promote economic development and the environment Protecting a win-win situation provides legal protection. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;span>;&lt;strong>;4.

Among the five notices, three were related to the Ministry of Science and Technology. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The notice shows that the responsibilities of the Ministry of Science and Technology for organizing the development of high-tech development and industrialization plans and policies will be assigned to the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology; the responsibilities of the Ministry of Science and Technology for organizing and formulating plans and policies for promoting the development of ecological environment through science and technology will be assigned to the Ecological Environment Ministry of Science and Technology; the Ministry of Science and Technology’s responsibility for organizing and formulating plans and policies for science and technology to promote health and health development will be assigned to the National Health Commission. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;With the responsibilities divided into other departments, there are also corresponding staffing levels. Wang Futao, a professor at the School of Public Administration at South China University of Technology, has long been concerned about science and technology policy. In his view, the adjustment of the establishment also means that the Ministry of Science and Technology&#39;s &quot;reorganization at the central level has basically been implemented.&quot; &quot;This is completely consistent with the reform plan at the beginning of the year.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On March 10, 2023, the &quot;State Council Institutional Reform Plan&quot; was released, emphasizing the need to strengthen the optimization and adjustment of institutional responsibilities in six key areas including science and technology. The plan mentions thirteen specific subdivided tasks, among which &quot;reestablishing the Ministry of Science and Technology&quot; is the first of the thirteen tasks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On March 16, 2023, the &quot;Plan for the Reform of Party and State Institutions&quot; was announced, stating that the Central Science and Technology Commission will be established. The plan emphasized that the responsibilities of the Central Science and Technology Commission&#39;s office will be assumed by the reorganized Ministry of Science and Technology as a whole. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Also in this reform plan, a time limit is given for the reorganization of the Ministry of Science and Technology: &quot;Reform tasks at the central level strive to be completed by the end of 2023, and reform tasks at the local level strive to be completed by 2024. To be completed before the end of the year.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In summary, at the central level, the reform of the Ministry of Science and Technology involves the overlapping of functions between the Ministry of Science and Technology and other departments and the transformation of scientific and technological achievements. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the view of Sun Yutao, a professor at the School of Economics and Management of Dalian University of Technology, scientific and technological work covers many aspects such as economy, society, ecology, culture, etc., and the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, the Ministry of Ecology and Environment, the Health Commission and other departments also have their own Science and Technology Division, both of which include the application of science and technology in specific fields. Through the reform, this part of the Ministry of Science and Technology&#39;s functions has been returned to specific functional departments, and coupled with the establishment of the Central Science and Technology Commission, &quot;the overall overall planning and coordination has been strengthened.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the view of another scholar who has been paying attention to science and technology policy for a long time, the adjusted functions of the Ministry of Science and Technology have two typical characteristics: “First, these problems can basically rely on market mechanisms to solve the problems, or use It is more efficient to solve it through market mechanisms; secondly, these problems do not affect strategic issues.&quot; He added: &quot;For example, digitalization, of course, is better if it is faster, but if it is slower for a year and a half, it does not involve &#39;fatal matters&#39;. That is the &#39;stuck neck&#39; problem.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Major special projects such as &quot;stuck neck&quot; are still in&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;hands&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Put the timeline To stretch it a little further, in the past ten years, there have been three reforms and reorganizations involving the Ministry of Science and Technology. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sun Yutao has long been concerned about China’s scientific research funding policies. He explained that in 2014, the reform of the science and technology system was mainly related to scientific research funding. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Xiaoxuan, a researcher at the Institute of Science and Technology Policy and Management Sciences of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, once wrote an article in Guangming Daily and pointed out that the &quot;Several Opinions on Improving and Strengthening the Management of Central Financial Scientific Research Projects and Funds&quot; directly addresses the oversides and deficiencies in fund management. The problem of coexistence of two places is the major reform measure in 2014. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The core content of this document is reflected in two aspects. First, in view of the duplication, dispersion, inefficiency, weak supervision and other problems existing in the original fund management, an overall reform idea aimed at promoting standardized management is proposed. The second is to follow the rules of scientific research activities, emphasize the preparation of budgets based on actual costs at the operational level, and cancel the requirement that personnel fees be simply set in proportion. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Plan on Deepening the Management Reform of Central Fiscal Science and Technology Plans (Special Projects, Funds, etc.)&quot; indicates that China&#39;s science and technology planning system is about to undergo a &quot;major surgery.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Nearly a hundred competitive science and technology plans originally scattered in about 40 departments have been optimized and integrated into the National Natural Science Foundation, National Major Science and Technology Projects, National Key R&amp;D Plans, Technology Innovation Guidance Special Projects (Funds) and Bases and Talents 5 categories including special projects. Government management is limited to the macro level, and project review and management at the micro level are left to professional institutions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;The original national science and technology plan was divided into many scientific research projects. At that time, many people said that these projects were too scattered. All ministries and commissions had money to support the development of science and technology, and &#39;Kowloon water control&#39;.&quot; Sun Yutao explained, &quot; After the reform, these projects were concentrated in the Ministry of Science and Technology, so some people called this reform a &#39;reform to expand power.&#39;&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the reform of scientific research funding, in March 2018, the First Session of the 13th National People&#39;s Congress The first reorganization plan of the Ministry of Science and Technology was disclosed, and it was proposed to integrate the responsibilities of the Ministry of Science and Technology and the State Administration of Foreign Experts Affairs and reorganize the Ministry of Science and Technology as a component department of the State Council. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the opinion of the aforementioned unnamed experts, compared with the reform promoted by the Central Organization Office, the reform in 2018 is more led by the Ministry of Science and Technology itself. In the opinion of this expert, the reform at that time can be seen as an attempt at this reform: “In the international environment at that time, we still advocated taking the line of open cooperation, but made some adjustments in the way of resource investment. But the effect was not ideal. So this time the reform was upgraded and involved in-depth adjustments to the organizational structure.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Sun Yutao&#39;s view, the main purpose of the reform is to cope with the current challenges: &quot;Why Are we going to adjust like this now? This shows that the current problems we are encountering need to be solved through reform. In ten years, this problem will no longer exist. It is hard to say whether these functions will be transferred back to the Ministry of Science and Technology.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p >;What the Ministry of Science and Technology will focus on solving after this reform is basic research and &quot;stuck&quot; problems. The aforementioned expert explained: &quot;The &#39;stuck neck&#39; problem includes major special projects. This part of the work is still in the hands of the Ministry of Science and Technology after the reform, and it has been upgraded to be handled by the central government.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sun Yutao also said that from now on From the perspective of scientific research, the importance of basic research is very high: &quot;From basic research, to applied research, to experimental development, the further you go, the more money you have to invest; but the further you go, the more important it is. Without basic research , how can we do the following things?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to basic research, major national science and technology projects come from the &quot;National Medium and Long-term Science and Technology Development Plan (2006-2020)&quot;, including large aircraft , manned spaceflight and lunar exploration projects and other 16 projects. It is worth noting that Yin Hejun has previously participated in major special projects. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Public information shows that on September 25, 2008, the Shenzhou 7 manned spacecraft was successfully launched, and Yin Hejun was the deputy commander-in-chief of the Shenzhou 7 mission headquarters; in December 2013, Chang&#39;e 3 The launch was successful. Yin Hejun once accepted media interviews as the deputy commander-in-chief of the lunar exploration project. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 20 Oct 2023 09:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[海滩失踪女童遗体发现：“疏忽父亲入刑论”应慎议]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258929]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-20 08:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;On October 19, 2023, Shanghai police reported: On the morning of October 18, Ningbo police received a report from Zhenhai, Ningbo City The body of a girl was found on a tidal flat in the district. Her clothing and other characteristics were similar to those of the missing girl from Nanhui Xincheng Beach in Pudong. A working team was quickly dispatched to the local area. After forensic examination and comparison of the deceased&#39;s biometrics and identification by her family members, it was confirmed that it was the missing girl Huang Moumou. &quot;The body was fully clothed and had no violent injuries. It is consistent with the characteristics of death by drowning and is excluded from criminal cases.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This touching case of missing children on the beach has a clear conclusion. It is sad that a beautiful life died like this. For a family that has suffered the loss of a daughter, this is an unbearable burden and is likely to become a wound that will never heal. The father of the child who was negligent in the whole incident will probably live with guilt and self-condemnation for a long time, and this kind of mental torture will be lifelong. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the child disappeared on the beach, there was a lot of criticism of the family and the father on the Internet. For example, they falsely accused the father of being a stepfather, spread rumors that the family favored sons over daughters, and deliberately caused the death of the girl. This kind of malice and lies in the name of &quot;justice&quot; has inflicted greater harm on this family and should be condemned. In addition, there are also voices on the Internet calling for the father of the child to be jailed for &quot;negligent death&quot;, so as to deter irresponsible parents. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;How to understand the latter point of view? Nowadays, from the time a child enters kindergarten, there are various safety educations on preventing drowning every year. However, the number of children who drown in China every year is not large in absolute terms. According to statistics from the Chronic Disease Center of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention and the Global Child Safety Organization, from 2010 to 2015, an average of 54,194 adolescents and children died due to injuries every year (148 people/day), with drowning, road traffic injuries and falls/falls being the top three causes. Bit injury cause of death. The &quot;2022 China Youth Drowning Prevention Big Data Report&quot; released by People&#39;s Daily pointed out that casualties caused by drowning rank first in China in the 0-17 age group, accounting for as high as 33%. &quot;As of the first half of 2022, many news reports have Instead of increasing, drowning accidents among teenagers occur frequently.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In these incidents of drowning deaths of minors, some parents were present at the scene but were distracted and negligent, leading to tragedy; some swimming pools did not allow parents to enter but were unable to ensure the safety of their children; and others Older children go to rivers or reservoirs to play or swim without telling their parents and companions, and accidents occur. If the crime of &quot;negligent causing death&quot; is used to punish the first category of parents, I am afraid that there will be many cases, and it will be difficult to produce a significant &quot;deterrence and prevention&quot; effect. On the contrary, there will be many side effects. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although China has implemented the &quot;comprehensive three-child&quot; policy, the current total fertility rate is very low, and the number of newborns born each year is still declining. Under such circumstances, those who are still willing to have one or two children often really do so because they love their children. Because they have inherited their own genes, parents have a very strong love for their children and a very high willingness to give to their children. It can be said that in this world, the people who love their children the most and care most about their well-being are their parents. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this case, it would be inhumane and inhumane to punish parents who caused the death of their children due to their own negligence. Children are the continuation of their parents’ lives, and most parents have no subjective intention to harm themselves. children or put their own children in danger. Of course, a very small number of beast fathers and beast mothers should be punished for intentionally harming their children. Secondly, it cannot improve the &quot;duty&quot; of parents. Are parents who carefully raise their children and are willing to do everything for their children? Are you afraid of being punished by criminal law when you create the best of everything? If this is the case, then his most rational consideration must be not to have children, instead of taking care of the children in front of the criminal law every day. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some people take Western countries as an example: parents who leave their children alone at home or elsewhere will be deprived of custody rights. But objectively analyze the two possible situations: the child grows up with the parents and allows the parents to be occasionally neglectful; or the parents occasionally leave the child alone at home and then give the child to another family or a child welfare agency to raise the child. Which one is better? Beneficial to children’s physical and mental health and well-being? Respecting family ties is obviously better for children. Moreover, this approach is a gross interference and trampling on the family, a natural community of blood, and creates many more and bigger problems than the ones it claims to solve. Parents should only be deprived of custody rights when they intentionally harm their children and are clearly detrimental to the child&#39;s physical and mental health and well-being. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The so-called guardianship is not an arbitrary power. It is actually full of responsibility and dedication, with love behind it. There will be no financial gain until the child reaches adulthood. Parents should provide their children with all economic resources, including food, clothing, housing and transportation, so that their children can grow up healthily. They should also protect their children&#39;s safety from various natural and man-made risks. Don’t you see, how many parents don’t give up the pursuit of their children because they were kidnapped by traffickers? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although tragedy has occurred, we should not require parents to become gods and saints. They should never make mistakes in their actions: parents must absolutely ensure the safety of their children, and any harm to their children must be held accountable. . This is harsh on human nature and is not consistent with reality. In short, respecting family ties, respecting the family, having empathy and understanding for parents, and maintaining the necessary modesty of power over the family are not only more conducive to the growth and well-being of children, but also defend the family as the foundation of civilization. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is the author&#39;s personal opinion only and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot; https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style= &quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 20 Oct 2023 08:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[男子遭邻居砸门近一年：数十次报警为何换不来警方追责]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258902]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-19 23:30:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 20 Oct 2023 00:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[洋葱狮子头丨云间夜话]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258806]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-19 23:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/18/2TqgZmHogdWwNZBkP55vBJzgCDuzWX14PMr53ntg.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;683&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/18/2TqgZmHogdWwNZBkP55vBJzgCDuzW X14PMr53ntg. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254352&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Lion head. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Everyone knows what Yangzhou Lion Head is. Of course it is a famous dish and no one is stupid enough to think of a fishy and dirty lion&#39;s head. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But Cubans really think you are going to take a bite of a lion&#39;s head - when Tao Yan first introduced this dish to the &quot;Guard Captain&quot; in Spanish, the latter&#39;s severe facial twitching showed that he was So understood. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The best Chinese restaurant in Havana is called &quot;Tiantan Hotel&quot;. The owner, Tao Yan, is my friend. He graduated from Shanghai Second Medical University and came to Havana very early. There are not many overseas Chinese in Havana. He has always The idea was to Cubanize his Chinese food. Cubans are very sweet and aromatic, so their Chinese dishes try to be as &quot;sweet and fragrant&quot; as possible, such as pig&#39;s trotters braised with sea cucumber, catfish stewed with tofu, and sweet and sour braised lamb chops, all with a large amount of Cuban sugar. Cubans can’t even figure out why Chinese food ingredients are so well matched. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Yangzhou lion head is the signature of the &quot;Temple of Heaven&quot;. After the captain of the guard knew that this &quot;lion head&quot; was actually a &quot;pig head&quot;, he came here often relying on his relationship with Tao Yantie. He was a tall man with a height of 1.9 meters. He was impatient with small dishes and specialized in picking big dishes. It’s a piece of meat, so I’m full of praise for the lion’s head in the “Temple of Heaven”. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I was sitting next to the captain of the guard that day. We also ordered the lion&#39;s head and thought it was &quot;too un-Yangzhou&quot;. It was like &quot;noodles&quot;. The ratio of starch to minced meat was wrong. The meat was too little. The ingredients were not in place. The taste was &quot;wooden&quot;. My wife felt itchy and said, I Come and give it a try! &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Her cooking method was passed down directly from her neighbor, a woman from Yangzhou. The first thing is the choice of pork. You cannot overemphasize the &quot;essence&quot;, it should be &quot;mixed with essence and oil (fat)&quot;, but it cannot be pork belly, it must be sandwiched. meat, and remove the fascia; minced pork cannot be the product of a meat grinder. It must be cut into small pieces first, then finely diced, and then minced into minced meat, but not too fine, as it will &quot;stick to the knife&quot;. This takes effort. Then add salt (or soy sauce), sugar, monosodium glutamate, minced green onions, diced fried dough sticks, rice wine, and appropriate amount of starch, and stir in one direction, usually clockwise, also called &quot;shangjin&quot;, until it is thick and sticky, waiting for frying. There is another trick here that is ignored by the outside world, that is, &quot;fine diced water chestnuts&quot; must be included in the ingredients. Water chestnuts are called &quot;di pear&quot; in Shanghai and &quot;horse hoof&quot; in the north. You can only buy canned water chestnuts in Cuba. . As for fried dough sticks, they are not available in Cuba, but local fried dough sticks can be substituted. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tao Yan looked on, his eyes widened and he was dumbfounded, and said, my lion head is just a mixture of minced meat, MSG, flour, onion, ginger, and soy sauce, and then deep-fried, you have to add so much Ingredients? ! My wife said that it is best not to add ginger, but out of habit I would add less ginger, as the flavor would be too strong. The last key is that the outside of each meat ball is not smeared with egg paste until before frying. The egg paste is made as follows: Beat eggs to one ratio of flour. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It must be fried hard, braised in brown sauce and reduced in juice. The lion&#39;s head is delicious when it&#39;s hard on the outside and tender on the inside. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Cubans are straightforward and came to taste the lion’s head the next day. As soon as he tasted it, he stood up and made a phone call. Not long after, a large group of relatives came. There were more than ten of them. They sat neatly like thugs all over the yard. They all looked at the dining table and sat in rows. , eat fruit. This is a Cuban custom. Once there is delicious food, the whole family comes to share it. However, Tao Yan was frightened and explained to the guard captain in Spanish that today was just a trial production and it was impossible to supply a large group of people at once. The guard captain blinked his eyes honestly and refused to leave. My family is here and I want them to go back. Where can I put my face? ! &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tao Yan was frightened. Please call my wife urgently. &quot;So many big eaters?!&quot; The wife couldn&#39;t help but groan. The lion&#39;s head was slightly smaller than a tennis ball. The captain of the guard could swallow 10 of them by himself. But what! How many &quot;noodles&quot; are there from the past? she asked. The answer is that there are many in the refrigerator. The wife asked to take them all out, defrost them, took a large bottle of mayonnaise, dipped the &quot;gnocchi&quot; in the heavy flavor, turned on the oil pan, and fried it over high heat. The aroma was overflowing, and served it hot to the relatives of the guard captain. Have to howl. The inside of the &quot;gnocchi&quot; is not that good, but the egg skin shell is especially crispy and salty when fried. This is a particularly pleasing thing for my wife. But the guard captain is not stupid. He knew that his wife&#39;s lion&#39;s head was better, and she knew the taste after eating the marrow, so within a few days he actually brought &quot;Whitebeard&quot;, a high-ranking official from Cuba. Of course, I didn’t forget to notify you in advance this time. &quot;Whitebeard&quot; is a close comrade of Castro. He drives a black Audi. As soon as he comes in, he says that he has brought a &quot;mysterious guest&quot; without permission. He heard that the &quot;Chinese Lion Head&quot; is particularly delicious and wants it. Have a taste. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tao Yan was dumbfounded when he saw it. She was an old lady with a noble status! He also had a young grandson with him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He turned sideways and leaned back as a habit. There was a large group of people in the yard, sitting in rows, eating fruits. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;This is our custom.&quot; The guard captain explained again. He also said that the people who paid this time were all relatives of &quot;White Beard&quot;. When Cubans go to dinner parties, they like to bring their entire family. This time I really learned the lesson. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It can be seen that the behavior of &quot;White Beard&quot; and the old lady is quite elegant. They gently bite open the lion&#39;s head, the inside is pink, and there is a slight gravy in the steaming heat, but the elegance does not diminish their elegance. Appetite, thumbs up while swallowing, the delicacies in the big basin are rapidly decreasing, and the guard captain&#39;s companionship has accelerated their disappearance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Because it was impossible to estimate the number of people who would &quot;sit in rows and eat fruit&quot;, there was a shortage of seats for the lion head, so my wife hurriedly took advantage of the opportunity to make it. Of course, it was too luxurious to chop the meat by hand, so I directly used a meat grinder, but The problem is, a catastrophic accident occurs unexpectedly. China runs out of green onions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Chives are a scarce commodity in Havana. The Chinese usually save on using them. Now that they are suddenly out of stock, where should they go to replenish them? Tao Yan suddenly caught a glimpse of the onions in the corner of the room. Isn’t an onion an onion? Although the taste difference is huge, it&#39;s hard to tell. &quot;The question is, what if Cubans happen to be good at this?!&quot; The wife asked Tao Yan coldly. The two looked at each other and understood. The latter immediately jumped into action and pulled out a large bag of onions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As you can imagine, the whole room was filled with the smell of onions fried in a big oil pan, and &quot;White Beard&quot; and the old lady couldn&#39;t sit still. People in the compound couldn&#39;t sit still. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;White Beard&quot; said, why is it getting more and more fragrant? For the sake of the continuation of this fragrance, I am even willing to launch another cooking &quot;revolution&quot;! &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The people in the compound left their original positions like the mud of a barrier lake, and squeezed into the dining room bit by bit like toothpaste. They shouted in Spanish and pushed each other. No one dared. Head straight to the table. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The final outcome is predictable. A famous dish was born in Havana.

In view of the fact that Song Xibin truthfully confessed his crimes after arriving at the case, and took the initiative to explain most of the criminal facts of bribery and misappropriation of public funds that were not yet known to the supervisory authorities. The crime of misappropriation of public funds constituted surrender; he pleaded guilty and repented, and actively returned the stolen goods. All the bribes and stolen goods have been recovered, and the misappropriated goods have been recovered. All public funds have been recovered before the first instance trial, and there are legal, discretionary or mitigated punishment circumstances. According to the law, he can be given a lighter punishment for the crime of accepting bribes and a reduced punishment for the crime of misappropriating public funds. The court then made the above judgment. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 19 Oct 2023 22:55:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[电梯事故频频发生，一图读懂如何自救？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258923]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-19 22:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/ image/23/10/19/9849783f0d.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;8581&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/ 19/9849783f0d.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254649&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 19 Oct 2023 22:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[1840年以来的中国与美国（上）丨倬彼云汉]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258853]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-19 21:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/19/bOI8j4tun986ghWujNQdJnuMPrxPcdSK9CR1TImi.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;692&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/19/bOI8j4tun986ghWujNQdJnuMPrxPcdSK9CR1 TImi. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254579&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Between 1872 and 1875, initiated by Rong Hong and supported by Zeng Guofan and Li Hongzhang , the Qing government sent four batches of 120 students to study in the United States. The average age of these students when they went abroad was only twelve years old. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Wedge&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The exchanges between China and the United States, if we start with the opium epidemic in 1840 It has been almost two hundred years since the war began. The young republic of the United States is making its first cry. In such a long process, the ups and downs, grievances and resentments between China and the United States are a very complicated record. Since China switched to welcoming the world, the entanglement between China and the United States is probably more complicated than the relationship between China and any other country in history, and has far-reaching consequences. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So, after receiving the mission of writing this article from Mr. Chen Fangzheng, I thought about it for a long time - I felt that I should write: Because this big topic is not only related to China and the United States, It can almost be said that the fate of the world in the past two hundred years has been inseparable from Sino-US relations in many cases. The turn in Sino-US relations often leads to a turn in world history - of course, China&#39;s destiny also changes accordingly, and similarly the destiny of the United States is also turbulent. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The reason I say this is because the basic pattern of Sino-US relations over the past two hundred years is: there is a host-object relationship between the strong and the weak. Because the United States has its own ideals, policies for founding the country, and choices it made to measure its position in the world at that time, if there are changes in its policy toward China, it will mostly be the United States that takes the initiative. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So, when discussing this issue, I often use the above perspective as a constantly changing clue to consider: Why did the United States do this in that specific time and space? In terms of Sino-U.S. relations, given the characteristics of time and space, how will the United States&#39; actions affect its own development direction and the overall international balance? Will the ensuing world situation lead to disaster or peace? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When I dictated this article &quot;China and the United States since 1840&quot;, I actually had mixed feelings in my heart. The relationship between China and the United States has its share of grievances and grievances, as well as unavoidable entanglements. Looking around the world, the help we receive from the United States is more significant and far-reaching than that of other countries. However, China is even more constrained by the United States and forced to go in many unexpected directions - this is not what China wants, and it also has a great impact on China&#39;s overall history. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Trade between China and the United States&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In 1840, Britain and China fought the first Opium War. In fact, the opium traders operating in Hong Kong at that time were not only British, but also Americans. The United States, a recently established emerging country, has also followed the United Kingdom in participating in international trade—China trade is a piece of meat that it must get involved in. At that time, he was following Charles Elliot in planning how to use force to open China&#39;s trade door, and American businessman Thomas Perkins was also involved. To this day, the Perkins family is still an important part of the New England family in the United States. They did the same, bringing opium in ships and taking away Chinese porcelain, tea and other commercial goods. However, this kind of trade is not permitted by Chinese law, which means that Britain is already conducting trade while forcibly opening the door to China. Although it was Britain that launched the First Opium War, its sponsors also included American businessmen in Hong Kong. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;China was defeated in this war and was forced to sign the Treaty of Nanjing with Britain. In 1844, the United States sent envoy Caleb Cushing to sign the Treaty of Wangxia with Qi Ying, the general representative of China and the governor of Guangdong and Guangxi. Since then, China and the United States established diplomatic relations, and Gu Sheng was the first minister. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After taking office as minister, Gu Sheng said that he was very excited and felt that this was a difficult responsibility. This youngest country, which had just emerged from the civil war and was involved in world politics and international relations for the first time, actually officially established relations with the longest-lived Eastern Empire in the world. He believed this was an important milestone in human history. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I live in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA, and I would like to tell you something that is very meaningful to me. On February 2, 1784, the birthday of George Washington, the &quot;Empress of China&quot; sailed from New York Harbor to China. It was the first merchant ship sent by the United States to China. What they brought was not opium, but thirty tons of wild ginseng collected near Pittsburgh (known as &quot;American ginseng&quot; or &quot;American ginseng&quot; in China), as well as leather, pepper, cotton and other commodities; taken from China, It is porcelain, tea, silk and other commercial goods - these are the typical products sold by China to the United States in Sino-US trade. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On several occasions, as a staff member of Taiwan&#39;s &quot;Academia Sinica&quot;, I visited Harvard University to negotiate cooperation matters, and I stayed in Harvard hotels. This hotel is an old-fashioned New England residence, with a wooden house, ancient wooden beds, and the rooms are filled with Chinese porcelain shipped by American merchants in the early days. In addition to China&#39;s own porcelain, we can also see trade porcelain specially fired for the United States and Britain, and we can also see Chinese silk fabrics used as decoration. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Such a scene made me feel that time and space were reversed: a young Chinese man went to the highest university in the United States to discuss academic cooperation - and in the room where I lived, all the people surrounding me were ancient Chinese objects. . This is something worthy of commemoration and worthy of my lifelong memories and emotions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since then, American merchant ships have entered China one after another. Although there were already motorized ships at that time, many of them had a combination of motors and sails. The &quot;Queen of China&quot; is a fairly large mixed-aircraft and sail ship, and the &quot;Chinese Scissor&quot; is even larger and faster. By around 1860, there were three ports for trading ships to depart from North America: San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Vancouver, Canada. They come and go regularly, traveling across the Pacific Ocean between the two coasts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the second half of the nineteenth century, the United States experienced the Civil War. The overall development direction has changed from developing new land to entering industrialization. Moreover, the most important projects in the development of the United States are the construction of large cross-state railways to the west, as well as the development of farmland and the construction of cities in the western half of the United States. Hundreds of thousands of Chinese workers provided important help in these tasks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In other words, the reason why the United States became the United States was that it transformed from an old British colony into a major country spanning two oceans. This process is of great significance to East Asia on the Pacific side; Sino-US relations have also gone through a very abnormal process. For example, Chinese workers who have made significant contributions are trapped by the Chinese Exclusion Act and cannot immigrate into the United States like European workers. As the United States has become a big country that spans two oceans, its industrial products can naturally enter the Chinese market more conveniently than Europe. Previously, the trade direction of Chinese daily necessities imported into the United States has since shifted to the direction of American products entering the Chinese market. Europeans competed for the trade markets of this vast and populous empire. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since then, these ships have brought countless Chinese young people to the United States for education. The first group of more than 100 Chinese children brought by Rong Hong entered American middle schools and then furthered their studies. After these &quot;young children studying in the United States&quot; returned to China after completing their studies, they worked in various fields such as diplomacy, business, and education. The beginning of this phase of Sino-US relations is of immeasurable significance to the Chinese people. The American influence brought by these people extended to the students who came to the United States under the so-called &quot;Gengzi Indemnity&quot; (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 毷体, 毷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Gengzi Indemnity&lt;/span>;) - this Among them, a very important figure is Hu Shi; of course, there are many other figures, including my mentor Li Jizhi. More than half of them have made significant contributions to China&#39;s modernization, are either scholars in pioneering research fields, or are extraordinary people who have created extraordinary careers. They also include the Nationalist Government&#39;s ambassador to the United States and figures in charge of foreign affairs in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of China. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Education in the United States and Modern China&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;At the beginning of the twentieth century, the world also changed a lot. The capitalist economy, which uses machine industry to produce goods, has swallowed up the entire world quickly and massively. Under this drastic change, white people not only became the masters of the world, but also competed among themselves for the &quot;leading&quot; position of exploiting the world. In Europe, there was World War I. In that war, the capitalist economy faced its first test: the germination and growth of international communism brought the world into the division of left and right; also in the modern Western state system, the communist system and its associated The ideal of symbiotic social good and social welfare. The United States only entered the war in the late stages of the European War. General John J. Pershing led the American war troops and declared to Britain and France: We are back and we are participating in the common affairs of the Old Continent. In Chinese history, the word &quot;West&quot; has since been divided into left and right sides; and this division has made China have to make choices in its struggle to break away from the old empire. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the process of importing Western ideas, American missionaries established schools in China, which was an important process. At the same time, the ideas brought to China by American intellectuals, including travelers, journalists, businessmen, and educators, therefore have at least two routes as their own choices, and the Chinese must choose. Similarly, the impressions they brought back from China have since then had two faces and images, left and right, resulting from their subjective choices and subjective descriptions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The earliest schools set up by Americans in China were affiliated middle schools run by missionaries to China in churches. It is difficult for us to say which middle school was opened earliest. Peking Union Medical College is the first modern medical school in China, as well as Xiangya Medical College in Hunan, West China Union University in Sichuan, and Qilu University in Shandong, all of which were founded by missionaries from the United States. Union Medical College adopts a method of integrating modern medical education with general hospitals and has become a model in China. Their influence extends to more remote provinces, such as Mingxian College in Shanxi, which was also established by American missionaries. During the Republic of China, in addition to the above-mentioned medical teaching, famous universities such as Yanjing University, Soochow University, Jinling University, and Zhijiang University were all founded by American missionaries and contributed to the development of education in modern China. In the field of history, Yenching University&#39;s Journal of Yenching, Academia Sinica&#39;s Journal of the Institute of History and Linguistics, and Tsinghua University&#39;s Journal of Tsinghua are collectively known as the &quot;Three University Journals.&quot; To this day, Tsinghua University on both sides of the Taiwan Strait is still a very important university, especially Tsinghua University in Beijing, which is the &quot;leading&quot; university in China. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fu Jen Middle School, where I study, was built by Chinese Christians in Shanghai who returned to their hometown of Wuxi. They believe that although they are not missionaries, they still set up schools with the service spirit of devout believers and in accordance with the educational level and teaching methods of British and American middle schools. Although these teachers from Furen Middle School only trained me for two and a half years (from the first semester of high school to the first semester of high school), they had a great influence on my life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From university education to secondary education, the United States has a profound influence on China. Medicine and education were areas where missionaries focused their attention. In 1937, the American Bureau for Medical Aid to China was established. These people with ties to China were basically missionaries to China. They returned to the United States and advocated helping China during the Anti-Japanese War and donating Chinese medicine, equipment and doctors. When China was under blockade and faced extreme difficulties, plane after plane of U.S. aid supplies entered China via the &quot;hump route.&quot; This includes the newly invented penicillin, the first batch of which was shipped to China after it officially left the factory, which was of great help to China&#39;s wounded soldiers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To this day, we should be grateful to them. Many missionaries stayed in China and stayed here until their old age; many missionaries considered China their hometown, and they said &quot;my hometown is in China&quot;; many missionaries protected Chinese children, Chinese wounded soldiers, and Chinese refugees during the Anti-Japanese War. By. In the case of the Nanjing Massacre, Jinling Women&#39;s University was designated as a &quot;protected area&quot;, and thousands of Chinese women fled there to receive rescue and avoid being ravaged by the Japanese. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Such things make us deeply moved. However, we also have entanglements. In U.S. trade with China, the U.S. is almost always outperforming and China is outperforming. And it is very regrettable that the United States also played a shameful role in the early opium trade: in terms of the amount of opium transported to China, the United States was not necessarily less than the United Kingdom—the United Kingdom and the United States were the largest opium traders. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/19/nH28zc6Tg2jXZeoIuvq8661q4HgVq1t9k6cqsaER.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;700&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/19/nH28zc6Tg2jXZeoIuvq8661q4HgVq1t9k6cqsaER.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254580&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In January 1945, the first Chinese transport convoy drove through the Burma Highway. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The complex grievances between China and the United States&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The greater grievances between China and the United States Grudges appear in the middle of war. The first time the United States intervened in China&#39;s war was during the Taiping Rebellion. At that time, there were many foreigners in the Shanghai Concession, and there were also many Chinese people who fled there. In 1860, American Frederick T. Ward led the formation of a &quot;foreign gun team&quot;. This group of mercenaries was small in number and very elite. Initially to defend the Shanghai concession, he later left the concession to help Li Hongzhang&#39;s Huai army and the Hunan army Zeng Guoquan&#39;s troops. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the late Qing Dynasty, the revolution led by Dr. Sun Yat-sen used the United States as a model in its early stages - although he did not seriously understand the various internal debates and struggles after the founding of the United States of America, nor did he study the impact of the American Civil War on American politics. Institutional influence. Later, the &quot;civil rights&quot; of the &quot;Three People&#39;s Principles&quot; were only explained in general terms. But after Sun Yat-sen established his government in Guangzhou, he had a most important struggle. He got rid of the influence of the Japanese ronin &quot;Xuanyang Society&quot;, but he also gained support from the new international communism in Europe and accepted some of their ideas. More importantly, the first revolutionary army organized by Sun Yat-sen to build New China received 8,000 rifles from the Communist International in Russia in the name of Whampoa Military Academy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Sun Yat-sen&#39;s conception, the prototype of people&#39;s livelihood doctrine is &quot;land to the tiller.&quot; This is also a dream shared by the peasant revolutionary armies in Chinese history, including the aforementioned &quot;Taiping Heavenly Kingdom&quot; rebels. After the establishment of the government in Guangzhou, cooperation with the Communist International led to the emergence of opposition between the left and the right within the Kuomintang, which also fundamentally changed the connotation of his &quot;people&#39;s livelihood doctrine&quot;: &quot;People&#39;s livelihood doctrine is socialism.&quot; Sun Yat-sen&#39;s ideal Changes also caused the blueprint for the founding of the Republic of China to not only cause ideological opposition between the left and right in the future struggle between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, but also lead to opposition between important party members. After his death, the so-called &quot;Ning-Han split&quot; originated from this. The right wing led by Chiang Kai-shek has since lost the support of the Kuomintang left wing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The second time the United States intervened in China&#39;s war was during the Anti-Japanese War. At the beginning of the Anti-Japanese War, China lost 800 aircraft within a month and nearly 3,000 aircraft during the entire Anti-Japanese War. Japan had the best aircraft in the world at that time, but China did not have the ability to manufacture them. It could only buy various types of aircraft from foreign countries and form them into an air force combat force. Therefore, China&#39;s airspace was abused by the Japanese at will. When the Chinese army is fighting, the bombs falling from the sky are more helpless than the bullets on the ground. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Claire L. Chennault, an American aerial aerobatic team member, organized American aerial athletes who were not afraid of death and established a Chinese Air Force American Volunteer Group (American Volunteer Group) in a private name. &quot;Flying Tigers&quot;. Their team members are dedicated aerobatic pilots who can climb out of the cabin and walk on the wings of a flying aircraft. They can take off in farm fields, land on barn roofs, do somersaults in the air without falling, and even swing in mid-air from a rope dangled from an airplane. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At first, they used aircraft that had been retired by the U.S. Air Force. After the &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; incident, the United States entered the war and reorganized this civilian force into the Fourteenth Air Force, with Chennault as commander. Since the establishment of this aviation force, I remember that starting in 1942, we could finally sleep peacefully in Chongqing. Our troops were fighting the Japanese and were covered by aircraft in the sky. China lost thousands of pilots during the War of Resistance. Slowly, our pilots can also fly the same aircraft as those in the United States and fight side by side with the &quot;Flying Tigers&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although these athletes from the United States are not in vain: they are rewarded with five taels of gold for each mission, and ten taels of gold for shooting down a Japanese plane. Everyone returned with dozens of pounds of gold. You know, the value of gold at that time was different from today; but among these young people, there were also a large number of them who left their lives in China. It is now estimated that they lost about 400 men from 1942 to 1945. As for whether they died for wealth or for righteousness, we can ignore it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What we particularly want to mention is the commercial exchanges between China and the United States. There are banks from many countries in the concessions of Shanghai and other treaty ports, the largest of which are the &quot;bank group&quot; of the United Kingdom and the United States, especially the British HSBC and the American Citibank. HSBC is still one of the largest banks in the world, and Citibank of the United States is the most involved in China&#39;s financial operations. The reason is that China’s first finance ministers who understood modern finance were Kong Xiangxi and Song Ziwen—Song Ziwen studied at Columbia University, and Kong Xiangxi graduated from Yale University. They brought the most important banking facilities in the United States to China. Therefore, China&#39;s first central bank was designed and operated according to the Bank of America, and regarded Citibank as a friend bank. When it overdrafted, it had Citibank as its backing. Without this backing, Chiang Kai-shek&#39;s central bank would have no credibility; and the central bank was one of the most important factors in Chiang Kai-shek&#39;s rule over China - not just with his army, but with a modern financial system. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Shanghai Stock Exchange is the first international exchange in the East. Together with the Wall Street, London and Tokyo Stock Exchanges, it has become the four important world financial trading points. This operation involves China&#39;s modern finance and modern economic operations into the world economic network. Few people pay attention to this. During this period, the United States squeezed China&#39;s finances more and less often helped China&#39;s finances. But in terms of importing this system into China, it can be said that no other country in the world can import its entire financial system into other countries, and have its most important bank as its backing. After the success of the Northern Expedition, Chiang Kai-shek established China&#39;s modern government, modern industry, national industry, national defense, etc. so quickly, all of which were inseparable from the financial support behind the United States. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the other hand, because the Eight-Power Allied Forces invaded Beijing, defeated the Qing army, and obtained 450 million taels of silver compensation from China - China had a population of 450 million at that time, which was equivalent to one tael of silver per person as compensation. . This reparation was known as the &quot;Gengzi Indemnity&quot; in history. Russia and Germany accounted for the largest proportion, followed by France, Britain, Japan, the United States, Italy and other countries. Japan used this compensation and the previous Sino-Japanese War compensation for domestic business and construction, which became the largest capital for later occupying the three northeastern provinces and even launching a full-scale war of aggression against China. The United States returned part of this compensation to China as a special fund for the latter&#39;s education development; subsequently, Britain, France and other countries returned part of the compensation. Tsinghua University was established with its support. When each new national university was established, funds were allocated from the &quot;Geng Geng Fund&quot; to support its construction - this was the case for the Central University, which was restructured from Liangjiang Normal School, and for national and provincial universities in various places. Until the end, when Tsinghua University in Taiwan resumed school, it still used a very small balance of the &quot;Genggen money&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From 1909, when the United States returned part of the &quot;Gang money&quot; to support China&#39;s education, to 1964, when Tsinghua University in Taiwan resumed school, the &quot;Gang money&quot; continued to have an impact on China&#39;s education for such a long time. But to put it another way, the &quot;Gengg money&quot; is a huge debt that China has borne. This group of foreign banking syndicates lent money to China - China did not have huge funds to pay the compensation, so it could only borrow money from the World Bank syndicate to pay. When the refund comes, the original loan will still be in the World Bank Group. We can only withdraw interest and deduct what he needs for himself. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The last &quot;geng money&quot; payment was handled by my late father, Boxiang Gong, when he was transferred to the Ministry of Finance as a customs supervisor. After the unequal treaty was terminated in 1942, he was responsible for sorting out the remaining balance of the &quot;Gengg money&quot; and the method of compensation. During the difficult and difficult period of the War of Resistance, the Westerners did not forgive us this debt. My late father was about fifty years old at the time. Every time he came back at night, he would look at the accounts and feel very sad. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On December 7, 1941, Christmas Eve, Japan attacked Pearl Harbor and the United States entered the war. Finally, because of its status as an allied member, China canceled all unequal treaties. This is tantamount to lifting the burden that China has carried for decades. Since then, the relationship between the United States and China has entered a new stage. The original civilian identity of the &quot;Flying Tigers&quot; became the Fourteenth Air Force of the United States. The Chinese Expeditionary Force also went abroad from Tengchong to rescue the British army in Burma. This army was incorporated into the command sequence of the Allied Powers, the Chinese, British and American Allied Forces. The United States also sent a representative, General Joseph Stilwell, as the chief of staff of the Chinese theater. Stilwell wanted to be the commander-in-chief of the Chinese theater and command the entire Chinese army, but Chiang Kai-shek disagreed. Since then, the U.S. military has intervened in China&#39;s military, and there have been endless grievances and resentments. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the last two years of the Anti-Japanese War, American aircraft flew over the &quot;Hump Route&quot; to transport supplies to China and also provided aircraft for the Chinese Air Force via this route. On land, the Stilwell Highway, the road from India to China via Myanmar, was also opened, and truckloads of supplies entered China, all under the command of Stilwell. China needs his permission to call in these troops. When the Chinese army is fighting on the front line and every second counts, it often misses the opportunity because it needs to see the battle plan. On a battlefield thousands of miles away, the battle situation is changing rapidly. How to provide a battle plan? This makes the last stage of China&#39;s battle still very difficult because there are people on the side who are restricting it. Of course, in the last battle in Changde, if American military planes had not transported reinforcements from afar to Changde, we would not have been able to stop the Japanese from marching in. This was a very significant help provided by the United States to China during the Anti-Japanese War. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Chinese part of the Stilwell Highway was dug by hand in the mountains of Yunnan by villagers from various ethnic groups. More than 2,000 trucks entered China from Myanmar. In fact, the United States donated about 4,000 trucks to China. Half of them overturned on the Stilwell Highway. These cars were driven in by young overseas Chinese from Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and other places who went to Myanmar to join the army as volunteers - they had never learned to drive such cars, and more than 2,000 people remained in the ravine forever. They originally wanted to return to their motherland to help in the war of resistance, but they had never even set foot on the land of their motherland. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the early days of the Anti-Japanese War, in order to win assistance from the United States, Hu Shi, the Nationalist Government’s ambassador to the United States, gave fifty or sixty speeches across the United States. Chiang Kai-shek&#39;s wife, Ms. Soong Meiling, also made a special speech in the U.S. Congress, which changed Americans&#39; impression of China away from the image of Chinese workers in the United States. At the same time, American journalists and writers, especially Pearl S. Buck and Henry Luce (Chinese name Lu Siyi), publisher of Time and Life magazines, continued to introduce to the American public China’s sufferings. struggle in. On the other hand, as the Japanese front in northern China advanced westward, cadres sent by the Eighth Route Army behind enemy lines took control of the countryside. American missionaries and visitors to China in those areas, and later including John S. Service, a staff member of the U.S. embassy and consulate, conveyed news from the north to the United States. Among them, Edgar Snow&#39;s news reports had an immeasurable influence. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This divergence of public opinion, coupled with the confrontation between Stilwell and Chiang Kai-shek, caused an important conflict in the relationship and cooperation between China and the United States in the final period of World War II. After World War II, &quot;McCarthyism&quot; emerged in the United States, causing serious divisions between the left and the right in the United States. That rift led to the so-called &quot;who lost China&quot; debate. Going a step further, the United States looks back at post-World War II Europe with the same mentality. The rise of the Soviet Union and the civil war between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party in China led to nearly two decades after World War II. The United States tended to resist and contain communist countries in the world it led and its related foreign policies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the end of the Anti-Japanese War, the civil war between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party began, and the United States became inexplicably entangled in it. The United States sent the &quot;Dixie Mission&quot; composed of diplomats such as Xie Weisi and others to visit Yan&#39;an. They came back and said: Yan&#39;an is the hope of the future, Chongqing is a dark place; Chongqing is going to decline, and Yan&#39;an is going to rise; help Yan&#39;an , don’t help Chongqing. It’s hard for us to say what’s good and bad between them. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(Compiled by Chen Xinhua, Associate Professor of Shenzhen Administration Institute)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 19 Oct 2023 21:25:04 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[陕西省政协原党组书记、主席韩勇被查]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258925]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-19 20:30:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;span>;Han Yong, former Party Secretary and Chairman of the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference, is suspected of serious violations of discipline and law and is currently under investigation by the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection Disciplinary review and supervisory investigation by the National Supervisory Commission. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 19 Oct 2023 20:55:04 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
