On the evening of August 10, 2023, 115 undergraduate freshmen in the class of 2023 at the Zhiyi Academy of Beijing Institute of Technology received a questionnaire, including MBTI, favorite &quot; &quot;Idol&quot; (idol, refers to idol artists), as well as work and rest habits. This questionnaire is prepared for freshman dormitory assignment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before dawn the next day, the dormitory list was released. The person who was commissioned to design the questionnaire was their senior sister, Lu Jiahui, a 2022 student of Zhiyi Academy. Her original intention in designing the questionnaire was to bring people in the same circle together based on the results of the questionnaire, &quot;so that they can spend their four years in college more happily.&quot; . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lv Jiahui’s own dormitory experience was somewhat regretful. The roommates had different hobbies and “basically had nothing to talk about.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Soon, this questionnaire was posted on social media, and the topic &quot;BIT Dormitory Allocation Statistics MBTI&quot; became a hot search topic. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past, dormitory allocation in colleges and universities was often done randomly. Nowadays, more and more colleges and universities are exploring other methods, and MBTI is just the latest one. Nanjing University and Chengdu University use questionnaires to collect information about freshmen, and then assign or recommend roommates to them through algorithms; while some schools such as Communication University of China and Zhuhai Institute of Science and Technology (formerly Jilin University Zhuhai College) give students the right to choose. Spontaneously organize and publish &quot;resumes&quot; written with their living habits, personality and hobbies to find suitable roommates. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The seemingly various allocation methods are more or less designed to avoid possible conflicts in university dormitories. Wang Qing, a lecturer at the School of Humanities at Jiangxi University of Finance and Economics, has studied the relationship between university dormitories. She believes that &quot;if these factors are taken into account when arranging dormitories, conflicts will be reduced to a certain extent.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Behind the dormitory conflicts There is another deeper social and cultural change of youth. Wang Qing also agreed: dormitory allocation can only solve part of the contradiction. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;BIT Dormitory Allocation Statistics&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;MBTI&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The most concerning question in this dormitory allocation questionnaire is: MBTI is one of the most popular personality tests today. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;MBTI is the abbreviation of Myers-Briggs Type Indicator. The test result consists of 4 letters and refers to a person’s attention direction, cognitive style, judgment style and lifestyle. Dimensional tendencies. The framers were an American mother and daughter named Briggs and Myers respectively. In the eyes of this mother and daughter who had no professional background in psychology, they could use four rulers to classify complex human nature into 16 species. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The MBTI test has been widely used in company recruitment and team building, but its scientific validity has also been questioned. Some studies have found that more than half of people retest after a few weeks or more than a year. , will get different results, so there are flaws in its consistency, stability and reliability. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lu Jiahui, who allocates dormitories to 115 freshmen, is a &quot;peer mentor&quot;, that is, a senior who answers questions in the freshmen group. She believes in the accuracy of the MBTI. Her MBTI type is &quot;entj&quot;, which is called a commander personality. This type of person tends to make quick decisions and has strong action ability. It only took her an hour and a half to complete the questionnaire design, and sent it out at 7:30 pm on the 10th. At 4:30 am on the 11th, the dormitory allocation results for the entire grade were sent to the group. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The questionnaire was quickly posted online. On August 12, Lu Jiahui discovered that the entry &quot;BIT dormitory allocation statistics MBTI&quot; had been on the hot search list for nearly ten hours, ranking highest at second place. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to MBTI, the questionnaire also discussed whether snoring, talking in sleep, getting up at night, chasing stars, &quot;two-spined salamander&quot; (two-dimensional), etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The questionnaire also attracted attention within BIT. “My counselor’s phone number was blown up by counselors from other colleges.” Then, the questionnaire became popular in the school. Someone left a screenshot of the same questionnaire on Lu Jiahui’s social media: “The College of Economics and Management also has it! ”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This trend has spread to more colleges and universities. On August 29, a student at the School of Intelligent Accounting and Management of Guangdong University of Finance and Economics discovered that the questionnaire collected by her college for dormitory allocation only included MBTI types, and the final allocation results were mainly based on &quot;i people&quot; (introverts) and &quot;e people&quot; ” (extrovert) distinction. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ru Jingfei, a counselor at the School of Law of Southwest University of Political Science and Law, looks for inspiration in her own employment guidance and mental health classes. In addition to the MBTI, the questionnaire she designed also included &quot;questions that are likely to cause conflicts in dormitory life&quot; collected from graduates. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In recent years, many colleges and universities have begun to reject the past &quot;blind box&quot; method, which is a randomly assigned dormitory allocation plan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past, dormitory allocation mainly considered students with the same major, class, and adjacent student numbers to be grouped together. The ordering of student numbers usually referred to the pinyin and strokes of the surname. There are also schools that arrange dormitories according to the order of registration. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2022, Chengdu University asked freshmen to fill out a questionnaire including questions such as &quot;Are you a social cow or a social fear&quot; and &quot;Do you accept durian, snail noodles and other odorous foods&quot; to match freshmen with roommates. In the same year, according to the official account of Lanzhou University, in order to &quot;allow students to choose like-minded roommates,&quot; some colleges introduced a method of allocating dormitories by selecting roommates from each other, and students posted self-introductions in the group like &quot;writing a resume.&quot; and expectations for roommates, making a two-way choice. When the 2023 freshmen of the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China choose their own rooms online, they can check the waking up and sleeping habits of the selected roommates in a certain room. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/zO1vXlylqmdxb8XSjKWbv3lP67K8DLqIsXTODMm5.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;988&quot; height= &quot;659&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/zO1vXlylqmdxb8XSjKWbv3lP67K8DLqIsXTODMm5.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251431&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On September 16, 2023, the seniors guided the 2023 freshmen to go through the registration procedures at Huzhou College in Zhejiang Province. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Yes&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;iYes&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;e A&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;more interesting&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;? &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Controversy also ensued: whether the roommates assigned through MBTI are reliable. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Lu Jiahui’s conception, MBTI is not the most important. Her priority was an open-ended fill-in-the-blank question about &quot;other needs&quot; in the questionnaire, and then the order of consideration was: personal work and rest habits, interests and hobbies, and then MBTI. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the open-ended fill-in-the-blank question, some people followed the prompts and filled in who they wanted to live with. If both parties were willing, they would be placed together; some people filled in &quot;I don&#39;t want to be in the same dormitory with star chasers.&quot; &quot;. Through the collected questionnaire answers, Lu Jiahui could not judge who could accept these unexpected demands, but she set a self-evaluation question about &quot;tolerance&quot;, with a full score of 5 points - people with high self-evaluation scores were considered There is a greater chance of accepting the individual needs of roommates. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the dormitory allocation of the School of Intelligent Accounting and Management of Guangdong University of Finance and Economics, a freshman observed that the configuration is roughly &quot;two i and two e&quot; in one dormitory. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ru Jingfei did not directly judge which personalities are suitable. She reminded students to consider whether they need roommates with complementary or similar personalities. She also suggested that &quot;Having I&#39;s and E&#39;s will make dormitory life more interesting.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Different allocation methods are related to different needs. Even on the indicator of student origin, different people have different considerations. Southwest Political Science and Law is located in Chongqing. Ru Jingfei does not recommend that everyone in a dormitory come from the same place, and believes that &quot;it is best to have someone from Sichuan and Chongqing in a dormitory, so that it will be much more convenient when going out to play.&quot; What Lu Jiahui is most afraid of is the difference in eating habits between the north and the south. &quot;It&#39;s very uncomfortable if you can&#39;t eat one piece.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lanzhou University advocates &quot;multicultural integration&quot;. One college stipulates that &quot;each dormitory has students from the south and the north&quot; and &quot;no less than 3 provinces of origin.&quot; &quot;Diversity&quot; also has another meaning. In 2022, in order to avoid collective late arrival at &quot;eight in the morning&quot;, the school&#39;s law school assigned a classmate who is accustomed to getting up early to each dormitory to serve as the &quot;dawn rooster&quot; of each dormitory. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The plans vary, but what most designers care about is whether roommates can chat with each other. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Behind closed doors, the dormitory is just a circle.” A significant comparison is that the college dormitories of Lu Jiahui’s good friends are all “two-dimensional” and they can play well; and her own roommate , there are those who pursue Korean entertainment, and there are those who like racing, &quot;basically there is nothing to talk about.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Nanjing University has set up a questionnaire since 2017, which not only counts interests and hobbies, but also uses algorithms to find potential correlations between different hobbies. Guo Yamin, a teacher at the student affairs office of the school, once introduced to the media that the interests and hobbies of the &quot;post-00s generation&quot; are wide and highly dispersed. The school&#39;s &quot;hidden semantic model&quot; algorithm can use some implicit characteristics to deduce the students&#39; possible hobbies from their existing hobbies. Match roommates based on your interests, such as putting those who like drama with those who like history, or those who like biology with those who like physics. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Furthermore, Nanjing University’s questionnaire is adjusted every year. Guo Yamin explained to Southern Weekend reporters, “The concerns of each generation of children are different.” In the 2023 questionnaire, freshmen were asked whether they prefer the AA system (everyone shares the expenses equally) or taking turns to treat guests when going out with their roommates, and whether they can accept invitations from their roommates to go out with friends on weekends. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Guo Yamin said, &quot;Nowadays, children have lived alone since childhood. When they suddenly enter collective life, there are always a lot of discomforts.&quot; The school&#39;s approach is to try to reduce the &quot;discomforts&quot;, Don&#39;t group people who are too different together. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;A dormitory relationship intervention experiment&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Wang Qing, a lecturer at the School of Humanities at Jiangxi University of Finance and Economics, once tried to find a set of methods for running-in university dormitory relationships through his own experiments. Methodology. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Qing has served as the head teacher for five years since 2016, and has actively or passively intervened in many dormitory conflicts. Some students asked her for help privately: They had a bad relationship with someone in the dormitory, which caused a lot of trouble. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before 2023, Jiangxi University of Finance and Economics will allocate dormitories randomly within classes. In 2020, Wang Qing decided to select a part of the dormitory and artificially interfere with the direction of dormitory relations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the beginning, considering that there were many female students in the College of Humanities, Wang Qing decided to start with the female college dormitories. She selected 38 freshmen girls from four classes, and organized a group activity of &quot;making love together&quot; once a month after enrolling in the dormitory, a total of three times. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Later, it was discovered that the conflicts in the boys’ dormitories were more serious, but they were not good at asking for help. Wang Qing learned from research that the physical conflict rate in boys&#39; dormitories is higher, and the degree of intimacy and integration and satisfaction with interpersonal relationships in the dormitories are also lower than those in girls&#39; dormitories. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The theme of the activity is related to the mechanism of dormitory relations. Wang Qing analyzed that dormitories are spaces where public and private attributes are mixed, where individuals eat and sleep, but where strangers live together. In such a space, students need to learn how to grasp the scale - what is the place where individuals can play, and where is the place where others should be respected. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The theme of the first event is public order. Wang Qing simulated a scene: At 11 o&#39;clock in the evening, you are very tired and want to sleep, so you close your eyes. Your roommate is anxiously catching up on homework and typing on the computer. Wang Qing hopes that through empathy, the dormitory group can form the first agreement: strictly abide by the work and rest system and not interfere with others. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To this end, she developed a 27-page intervention manual, which planned the process of each activity and mentioned common dormitory crises such as &quot;small groups&quot;. She tried to guide students to think about how to solve these situations when they happened in their dormitories. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the end of the three activities, the students’ feedback achieved the results she expected. They underwent two tests to compare the development of the quality of interpersonal relationships in the dormitory before and after the event. The survey included tense situations such as cold wars and verbal conflicts, as well as collective activities and emotional exchanges within the dormitory. The students were also asked what they thought about the situation. How satisfied are you with the dormitory relationship, and whether you want to apply for a dormitory change. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another 36 female college students who had not participated in the activities also accepted this test. Comparing the two, Wang Qing concluded that appropriate communication intervention can indeed eliminate interpersonal conflicts and alienation in advance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After 2020, Wang Qing will no longer serve as the head teacher. Ru Jingfei, who has been a counselor for seven years and has tutored more than 1,200 students, has discovered that there are more and more dormitory conflicts among college students, and they tend to break out in lower grades. She was once called to the student dormitory in the middle of the night to deal with a fight. &quot;If you can, just mediate. If it doesn&#39;t work, you have to change (dormitory).&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Qing introduced that at present, China’s intervention against conflicts in college student dormitories generally focuses on post-event repair and remediation. From the perspective of school management, some dormitories with poor relations can be regularly selected for intervention. However, Wang Qing also knows very well that as time goes by, the effect of the original intervention will become weaker and weaker. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One reason is that the concepts, psychology and behavioral logic of the new generation of students are changing. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Lying talk sessions have become a legend&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In today’s school administrators’ vision, intervention in dormitory allocation can avoid some foreseeable conflicts earlier. . A survey of 3,875 college students across the country by Shanghai Ocean University showed that the main reasons why students are dissatisfied with dormitory relationships are work and rest habits, personal hygiene, introversion/extroversion personality, and whether to play games. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, intervening in dormitory allocation is not a one-time solution. Ru Jingfei believes that even if the allocation method has been optimized, it can only solve superficial conflicts such as work and rest. She and other counselors often discuss that students’ self-awareness has become stronger and they are exposed to more information, which has brought about changes in dormitory relationships. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When chatting with Wang Qing, a counselor said that students born in the 1970s and 1980s would think that roommates may be very important partners in life. They have a great influence not only during the study period, but also after graduation. Later, it can also become a boost for emotional and career growth. But now, many children have very clear goals after entering college: enrolling in graduate school, going abroad... From the beginning of their freshman year, they will arrange their lives according to their goals, and will not participate in group activities such as dinner parties. The dormitory may just be their own resting place. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Digitalization is also exacerbating this individual loneliness. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When Wang Qing went to college about 20 years ago, mobile phones were only used for making calls and sending text messages. A very important dormitory activity at that time was sleeping in bed after lights out. “Nowadays, many children actually don’t have beds. Talk, everyone is very busy, mobile phones can meet many needs, and the connection, intimacy and integration between people will be reduced a lot.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Psychology Center of Beijing University of Chemical Technology reported in 2019 The school conducted a survey among 400 students. More than 80% of the students believed that the relationship in the dormitory was harmonious, but nearly half admitted that there were frictions in getting along. When asked to describe the relationship in the dormitory in one sentence, 40% chose &quot;like family&quot;, while more people chose &quot;ordinary friends&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Qing, who is no longer the head teacher, is still worried about the situation of the students. &quot;(dormitory conflicts) occur every year, so I think this is not an accidental problem. A large part of the group will have such problems during their studies.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lu Jiahui is also not sure about the effect of dormitory allocation. She plans to verify the effect of dormitory allocation in mid-September and conduct an offline or online anonymous survey on freshmen who are willing to be interviewed to ask them how they get along with their roommates. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some more acute problems cannot be avoided by dormitory allocation. Wang Qing gave an example. For example, if two people in the dormitory happen to be two candidates for the scholarship, they may have potential conflicts of interest. In addition, professional views, conduct, etc. may also cause conflicts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Qing wrote the 2020 experiment in the article &quot;Analysis of the Intervention Effect of Intervention on Interpersonal Relationships in Female College Students&#39; Dormitories&quot;. In the article, she concluded: The quality of interpersonal relationships in college students&#39; dormitories is the highest at the beginning of getting along, and will be followed later. progressively worse. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What a student said to Wang Qing left a deep impression on her: &quot;My roommate is not my friend, we just live together.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>; &lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net &lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div >;</description><pubDate> Wed, 20 Sep 2023 22:55:05 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[发明了火药的中国，为何明清时火器技术落后了？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257188]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-20 21:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Gunpowder is one of the four great inventions in ancient China, but there are also some controversies surrounding gunpowder. For example, Lu Xun said &quot;Foreign countries use Gunpowder is used to make bullets to defend enemies, but China uses it to make firecrackers to worship gods.&quot; Another example is that in recent years, some people on the Internet have claimed that yellow gunpowder invented by Europeans in the 19th century is the real gunpowder. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These two statements are debatable. After China discovered gunpowder, it was used to make various firearms for use on the battlefield. The world moved from the Middle Ages to modern times, and the entire process relied on black gunpowder. Yellow gunpowder greatly accelerated this process in the late modern period, but the significance of black gunpowder cannot be ignored, and without black gunpowder as the basis, Europeans would not have been able to invent yellow gunpowder. gunpowder. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The huge potential of Chinese firearms&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Gunpowder first appeared in Taoist priests&#39; alchemy furnaces and was used as medicine. Ancient medicine believed that saltpeter can cure internal heat and stomach bloating, and sulfur can &quot;convert gold, silver, copper and iron&quot;. The two together are a kind of medicine for treating diseases, so they are called gunpowder. &quot;Compendium of Materia Medica&quot; believes that &quot;gunpowder can expel insects and ward off evil spirits.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Synopsis of the True Yuan Miao Dao&quot;, written in the mid-Tang Dynasty, records the power of the earliest gunpowder. Burning saltpeter, sulfur, realgar and honey together can cause deflagration and quickly burn the house clean. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the invention of gunpowder, it was quickly used on the battlefield. Some people used &quot;flying fire&quot; in the melee between warlords in the late Tang Dynasty. The &quot;Wu Jing Zong Yao&quot; of the Northern Song Dynasty recorded the formula of gunpowder at that time. The saltpeter content used in the explosion was very low, but the content of various combustion accelerants such as oil, rosin, and asphalt was very high. This shows the role of gunpowder in war at this time. It was an incendiary bomb rather than a bomb or bullet. In addition, the gunpowder at this time was sometimes added with arsenic to burn it and poison the enemy. It can be said to be the earliest chemical weapon in the world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Throughout the Tang Dynasty and Northern Song Dynasty, Chinese gunpowder was often used to make incendiary weapons, such as gunpowder arrows, fire caltrops, fire poles, poison smoke balls, and artillery (cannon stones coated with gunpowder and thrown by catapults) etc., are all incendiary firearms. Among them, the gunpowder arrow developed by Feng Jisheng in the early Song Dynasty used the recoil of burning gunpowder to push the arrow. It can be said to be the prototype of today&#39;s rocket. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, in terms of technical content and effectiveness, these firearms did not surpass those of their contemporaries in Europe. In 678 AD, when the Eastern Roman Empire faced a siege of 200,000 troops from the Arab Empire, it used copper pipes to spray &quot;Greek fire&quot; to burn enemy ships and annihilate the huge Arab navy. The formula of &quot;Greek Fire&quot; has been lost, but it should be a petroleum-based compound that can burn on the water surface and is extremely powerful when combined with mechanical spray. &quot;Greek Fire&quot; has long since become a secret weapon guarding the sea of ​​Constantinople. Many powerful enemies were defeated by &quot;Greek Fire&quot; and were helpless. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the era of confrontation between the Song and Jin Dynasties, due to frequent wars between the Song and Jin Dynasties, both sides invented new firearms to assist in combat, and Chinese firearms achieved great development. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Song general Chen Gui invented the musket. Although its function was closer to a flamethrower than a firearm at this time, the design of the tubular bamboo tube prepared the conditions for the firearm; Song general Wei Sheng invented the &quot;Ruyi Zhan&quot; for installing muskets. &quot;Car&quot;, pulled by animal power. In the Southern Song Dynasty, all warships were equipped with trebuchets that threw artillery (incendiary bombs). When Wanyan Liang invaded the Song Dynasty, the Song general Li Bao led the navy to surprise the Jin army&#39;s naval base Chenjia Island, using rockets, artillery, etc. to burn Firearms completely annihilated the huge Jin Army naval division. It can be said that China&#39;s water warfare weapons have reached the level of &quot;Greek fire&quot; at this time. The Southern Song Dynasty gunboats can be regarded as the earliest gunboats in the world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Jin people invented the world&#39;s earliest artillery - iron artillery for sieges; flying muskets that burned better than bamboo pole muskets, which can be called individual flamethrowers; and iron cans for storing gunpowder. The sky-shattering thunder made was ignited and thrown out. The sound was scary, and the exploded iron can fragments spattered damage to the surroundings. It can be said to be the earliest bomb in the world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During the Song-Mongolian War, the Song Dynasty invented the earliest firearm - the bamboo musket, which fired bullets to kill the enemy as far as 150 steps. In the Yuan Dynasty, the musket was Bamboo was changed to metal, and metal fire guns were created. By the end of the Yuan Dynasty, they had become popular in the military. However, until the early Yuan Dynasty, China&#39;s firearms were still mainly incendiary firearms. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From the Southern Song Dynasty to the Yuan Dynasty, Chinese firearms basically cover all categories of thermal weapons still in use until modern times. However, the Islamic world quickly learned various categories of Chinese firearms, and was even better in research and development. After being introduced to Europe, European firearms developed rapidly, leaving the rest of the world far behind. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The Middle East and Europe came from behind&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The Song Dynasty was the golden age of trade and cultural exchanges between China and the Islamic world. Many Arabs, Persians, and Central Asians settled in China and were even employed by the Song Dynasty. army, who quickly spread their knowledge of gunpowder and firearms back to Arabia. In addition, the Mongolians widely used firearms against the Islamic world during their Western Expeditions, which also promoted their learning of firearms. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1240, the botanist Ibn Beytar of Al-Andalus (now southern Spain) introduced Chinese saltpeter in his book &quot;Medical Prescriptions&quot; and called it &quot;Chinese snow salt&quot;. &quot;Fire and saltpeter&quot; introduced its deflagration properties. In 1256, Kublai Khan&#39;s brother Hulagu established the Ilkhanate in Persia. Hassan Rahman, a Syrian who served in the Ilkhanate, wrote a military book &quot;Equestrianism and War Strategies&quot;, which introduced China in detail. Firearms, gunpowder formulas and saltpeter purification technologies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;West Asia and North Africa were originally rich in sulfur, but they did not know the use of nitrate, so they failed to invent gunpowder. Once they knew how to synthesize gunpowder, firearms developed rapidly in the Islamic world. The Mamluk dynasty that ruled Egypt created a new type of firearm &quot;Madafa&quot; based on the musket. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Motor Method&quot; replaced the Chinese bamboo gun barrel with a larger wooden barrel, and replaced the Chinese projectiles with stone balls. In fact, it transformed the musket into the prototype of modern artillery; there is also a The method of loading arrows in wooden tubes and using gunpowder to push iron arrows to attack may come from the tradition of crossbows in the Mediterranean region. Later, the earliest artillery in Europe also used iron arrows to attack, and it was probably influenced by this. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The motor method is actually superior to the firearms of the Yuan Dynasty and the Mongol Khanates. Moreover, the Arabs in the Middle Ages liked to experiment. The chemistry derived from alchemy was very outstanding, and the purification of gunpowder was also better than that of China. It can be said that they are catching up from behind. In other words, in the future, Europeans will learn firearms from the Islamic world from a higher starting point than China. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The earliest document recording firearms in Europe is the coronation address written by the Bishop of London for King Edward III in 1326. Below the coronation address is a picture of a bottle-shaped cannon, which uses gunpowder to shoot giant arrows. In Europe, the Italian city-states who were constantly striving for hegemony were the first to master the manufacturing technology of firearms. Later, firearms were also mastered by Britain, France and Germany, and they showed great glory in the Hundred Years&#39; War between England and France. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It was during the Hundred Years War that European artillery shifted its goal from killing people to siegeing cities. Europeans began to build huge cannons that could collapse city walls, and built larger and larger cannons in the competition. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1375, French cannon makers cast a huge cannon weighing 2,000 pounds (about 900 kilograms) in Caen. Two years later, Philip the Brave, King of Burgundy, blasted it with a huge cannon. He defeated the British at Alderac Castle and proved the value of the cannon. In the second half of the Hundred Years&#39; War, King Henry V of England used huge artillery to capture dozens of castles in France. Later, King Charles VII of France established the most efficient artillery in Europe, sweeping across the British army and recovering more than half of the country occupied by the British. France. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Europeans installed this kind of giant cannon on ships. In the Age of Discovery, they were invincible. Vasco da Gama led a few gunboats to travel across East Africa and India, equipped with dozens of giant cannons. The ships can often easily defeat enemies several times, ten times or even dozens of times larger. During the colonial expansion, the Europeans built bastions and deployed huge cannons in the colonies, which frightened thousands of indigenous troops and left them helpless. Europeans easily gained control of the entire world&#39;s seas through gunboats and fortresses, and dominated modern history. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The artillery from Western Europe also returned to Eastern Europe. The Russians used advanced guns and artillery to blow up the Mongolian khanates and advance rapidly toward the east. The Islamic world also introduced advanced firearms from Western Europe, and three gunpowder empires emerged, including the Ottoman Empire, the Safavid Empire of Persia, and the Mughal Empire of India. Even Central Asia, which was relatively isolated in modern times, had self-made weapons because of the teachings of the Ottoman Empire. Arquebus and light artillery capabilities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1453, the Ottoman Sultan Mehmet II captured Constantinople and eliminated the Byzantine Empire. The exaggerated Urban cannon played a major role, and the Sudanese pro-army Yeniceri was also an excellent force. Musket Army. In 1526, Babur, the relic of the Timur Empire, marched into India. In the Battle of Panipat, he used artillery to defeat the elephant soldiers of the Delhi Sultanate. He entered India and established the Mughal Empire. Later, the Mughal Empire set up a cannon factory. , a standing army with 70 guns. Due to poor road conditions, it was difficult for Persia to use giant cannons, and the use of firearms lagged behind. However, in the early 18th century, Nader Shah, who replaced the Safavid dynasty, used advanced muskets imported from Europe and camel-borne Wasp cannons to sweep through Persia and India. , Central Asia, defeated the Ottoman army many times, and became the last great conqueror in history. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The system of the Ming and Qing Dynasties brought the glory of Chinese firearms to an end&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;While firearms are advancing rapidly around the world, China, which invented firearms, has been left behind. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Emperor Kangxi of the Qing Dynasty was amazed by the performance of the Dzungar firearm &quot;Zanbalak&quot;. During the reign of Emperor Yongzheng, he copied it on a large scale and equipped it for the Qing army, which later developed into a gun. This kind of &quot;Zanbarak&quot; is a camel-borne wasp cannon, but it is an outdated weapon invented by the Mamluk Dynasty three to four hundred years before Emperor Kangxi. Although it is still somewhat unique in the geographical environment of Persia and Central Asia, Function, but it is several eras behind the advanced artillery in Western Europe. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The firearms in the Middle East and Europe overtook China in the Yuan Dynasty, mainly because the intensity of the war at that time was not high, and there was no need to improve firearms like the Europeans who fought every day. At the end of the Yuan Dynasty, the uprising army revived firearms. However, the firearms of Zhu Yuanzhang and other heroes in the late Yuan Dynasty all followed the path of weight rather than quality. Although the Ming army&#39;s firepower equipment rate reached 10% during the Hongwu period, with hundreds of thousands of firepower soldiers, the level of firearms may not reach the level of the Song Dynasty, let alone compare with Europe at the same time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When Zhu Yuanzhang fought against Chen Youliang at Poyang Lake, the &quot;big bowl mouth barrel&quot; he used was an anti-personnel shotgun, the &quot;no help&quot; was an incendiary bomb, and the so-called &quot;artillery&quot; was a trebuchet to throw incendiary bombs. Burn enemy warships. When attacking Zhang Shicheng&#39;s last stronghold in Suzhou, Zhu Yuanzhang used catapults instead of cannons to attack the city. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It can be seen that in the use of firearms in the troubled times of the late Yuan Dynasty, the transformation of European firearms into giant cannons was not seen. American sinologist Ouyang Tai believes that this is because China&#39;s rammed earth city walls are too thick to be destroyed by giant cannons, so there is no need to build giant cannons. However, Zhu Yuanzhang always used catapults that were much less powerful than giant cannons when he attacked the city. It can be seen that siege equipment does not necessarily rush to destroy the city wall, and there is no reason to give up the development of giant cannons. It should be because the overall technical level of Zhu Yuanzhang&#39;s army is too low and they cannot build them. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After seizing the world, Zhu Yuanzhang closed the country on the one hand and suppressed the people who killed the soldiers on the other. This resulted in a gap in knowledge and technology, and many technologies may have been lost as a result. Although the Ming army has a high firearms equipment rate, the Ming Dynasty has strictly prohibited private ownership and research and development of firearms since the founding of the country. Local governments cannot make their own firearms and must uniformly deploy them through the court, thus eliminating the possibility of society improving firearms on its own. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For the above reasons, the firearms of the Ming Dynasty were very backward. In the middle period, when the Portuguese appeared on the southeastern coast, their pre-loaded eagle cannons that could be fired continuously were regarded as artifacts by the Ming army. They called them &quot;Flan cannons&quot; and copied them. However, this kind of cannon was not popular in Europe at that time. It is already outdated and second-rate. Later, the ordinary naval guns of the Dutch became the &quot;Red Yi cannons&quot; used by the Ming army to save lives in the war with the Jianzhou Jurchens. The first ones the Ming army fished from sunken ships were fished from the sea. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Even the Ottoman Empire muskets, whose performance was obviously inferior to that of Europe, were modified by the Ming Dynasty Zhao Shizhen into the &quot;Rumi gun&quot; (Rumi means Rome, and the Ottomans regarded themselves as Rome), which was regarded as a sharp weapon. It can be seen that the Ming Dynasty The level of firearms is low. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the Jurchens suffered continuously under the Ming army&#39;s Hongyi artillery, they developed artillery on their own. With the guidance of the surrendered Ming army artillery team and European missionaries, their artillery use once led East Asia. However, as the Manchus learned from the Ming Dynasty and turned to isolation, these welcome changes gradually faded away. In 1724, Emperor Yongzheng expelled missionaries, and the Manchu Qing Dynasty&#39;s introduction of Western technology slowed down significantly. In 1776, after Emperor Qianlong pacified Jinchuan and Jinchuan, he achieved perfect martial arts and believed that there would be no trouble at home. In order to prevent firearms from flowing into the people, he destroyed a large number of firearms caught in the war. Made firearms, the pace of China&#39;s firearms innovation came to an abrupt end. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some overseas sinologists believe that China&#39;s unified system does not have as many wars as Europe, which is the biggest reason for the sluggish development of firearms in China. However, in fact, during the Ming and Qing Dynasties, there were no wars to quell civil unrest and bring people back home. There were quite a few, some on a very large scale, but they did not promote the development of firearms. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The most important reason is that the Ming and Qing Dynasties reversed the enlightened attitude of the Tang and Song Dynasties and reached their peak in preventing social autocracy. They were the masters of the Qin system and tried to monopolize the most advanced firearms technology as far as the eye could see. Not only is it closed to the country, cutting off economic and technological exchanges with the West, but it is also unwilling to allow the private sector to promote the research and development and upgrading of firearms. Naturally, the entire society has no enthusiasm and motivation for researching firearms. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When the emperors of the Ming and Qing Dynasties felt that the dynasty was in a military crisis, they would also vigorously introduce advanced European firearms, which shows that they have the ability to learn advanced technology. If this continues, even if the research and development is poor, they will not lag behind Europe. is too big. But once the crisis has passed, it will cut off ties with overseas countries and ignore the booming development of firearms outside the region until the Europeans knock on the country&#39;s door with powerful ships and cannons that the Manchus could not imagine. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 20 Sep 2023 21:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[不只得一微，证监会系统离职人员为何扎堆IPO？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257196]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-20 20:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/20/IxjlclwEZfHBM4nqcCpIhyvliHeh3Kh4DvTA8tRH.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1268&quot; height=&quot;986&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/IxjlclwEZfHBM4nqcCpIhyvliHeh3Kh 4DvTA8tRH. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251287&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In April and May 2021, the China Securities Regulatory Commission issued documents and regulations to strengthen the system.

However, because Peng Junheng was a person who had resigned before the release of the &quot;Guidelines&quot;, the prohibition period on investment does not apply to his investment behavior. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the view of Wang Jiyue, a senior investment banker, most of the shares held by the above eight resigned personnel in the company to be listed come from the equity incentives of their companies, and they are all indirect shares after multi-layer penetration, and the proportion is very small. , has little say in the entire investment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“It’s not that these people have discussed and invested in this company in disguise, it’s just a coincidence.” Wang Jiyue told Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Not only Deyiwei&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In fact, not only Deyiwei has gathered the above-mentioned personnel who have left the CSRC system. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Through E Fund’s employee shareholding platform, Liang Yuyin, Wang Jun, Luo Haobin and Yue Xinyu also indirectly hold shares in the proposed listed companies Feiyu Technology, Wangyuan Technology and Qihui Pharmaceutical.

However, as of the date of issuance of the inquiry letter reply (January 29, 2023), the above four people have withdrawn from the Minsheng Securities employee shareholding platform. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The official website of the China Securities Regulatory Commission shows that Feng Henian, then chairman of Minsheng Securities and former party secretary and director of the Shandong Securities Regulatory Bureau, underwent disciplinary review and supervisory investigation in June 2022 for suspected serious violations of disciplines and laws. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On January 6, 2023, the China Securities Regulatory Commission stated in a notice that Feng Henian was expelled from the party that Feng Henian had completely lost his ideals and beliefs. He actively planned a &quot;way out&quot; while he was in office, and continued to use his original position and status to amass money after leaving his job. , is a typical example of the &quot;revolving door&quot; corruption in politics and business. He has no bottom line in discipline and law, uses his former position and status to influence the issuance review work, seeks benefits for others, illegally accepts huge amounts of property, and accepts bribes from management service objects in the name of others. Extremely huge. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On March 30, 2023, Shenzhen Anke suspended the listing review process for the third time, and applied to withdraw its issuance and listing application on June 16. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is worth noting that Liang Yuyin and Wang Jun both participated in the E Fund Employee Stock Ownership Plan in October 2019 and invested in the same employee stock ownership platform Zhuhai Juningkang Equity Investment Partnership (Limited Partnership) According to Qichacha, Wang Jun holds 2.3747% of the shares and Liang Yuyin holds 1.0067%. However, Shenzhen Anke and Kangwei Century, which Liang Yuyin indirectly holds shares, did not disclose Wang Jun&#39;s shareholding. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the information disclosed by the above-mentioned companies, the way for the above-mentioned seven employees who have resigned from the China Securities Regulatory Commission to invest in the company to be listed is to invest in the securities firms and fund companies where they work through employee equity incentives, and the latter indirectly invest in Shenzhen Investment Holdings Donghai Small, Medium and Micro Venture Capital Enterprise (Limited Partnership) (hereinafter referred to as Shenzhen Investment Holdings), a number of private equity funds jointly funded by the Jiangsu provincial and municipal governments and the National Small and Medium Enterprises Development Fund Co., Ltd., these private equity funds eventually invested in companies to be listed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among them, E Fund Management is a shareholder of the National Small and Medium Enterprises Development Fund. The latter was decided and deployed by the State Council in May 2020. Under the leadership of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology and the Ministry of Finance, it was jointly established by the central finance and Shanghai Guosheng, China Tobacco and other social investors as a parent fund. Through investment and establishment of sub-funds, etc. The total scale of the fund has reached more than 100 billion yuan, focusing on solving the medium and long-term equity financing problems of innovative small and medium-sized enterprises. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;E Fund and Minsheng Securities both indirectly hold shares in the private equity fund Shenzhen Investment Holdings. The actual controller of Shenzhen Investment Holdings is Shenzhen State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tianjin Feixuan, which Peng Junheng invested in, also indirectly holds shares in the above-mentioned private equity funds and Shenzhen Investment Holdings, thereby indirectly investing in the company to be listed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to the above-mentioned shareholding paths, there is another situation in which Minsheng Securities personnel who receive equity incentives hold indirect shares in companies to be listed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Dehe Technology and Hengye Microchip, which are indirectly held by members of Minsheng Securities, Minsheng Securities is not only a sponsor, but also holds shares in the companies to be listed through subsidiaries. In Hengye Microcrystal, Minsheng Securities Investment Co., Ltd., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Minsheng Securities, was a new shareholder 12 months before the company&#39;s initial listing application. The shares directly held accounted for 1.44% of the company&#39;s total pre-issuance share capital. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The China Securities Regulatory Commission stipulates that the red line for sponsor institutions to hold shares in an issuer is 7%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among the above-mentioned companies, only Kangwei Century was successfully listed. Shenzhen Anke and Qihui Pharmaceutical both withdrew their listing applications, and the remaining companies are still in the IPO process. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;Going in both directions&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;It is not new for the personnel of the China Securities Regulatory Commission to leave their jobs and join market institutions, and major fund companies and securities firms are highly favored. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to incomplete statistics from the &quot;Beijing News&quot; in 2020, nearly ten CSRC officials have &quot;went overseas&quot; to work in financial institutions in the past three years. Compared with the situation a few years ago, when officials who &quot;went overseas&quot; were more inclined to fund companies, in recent years, most of the CSRC officials who &quot;went overseas&quot; worked for securities firms. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, in early 2020, Huatai Securities announced the appointment of Jiao Xiaoning as the company&#39;s chief financial officer. Jiao Xiaoning served as deputy inspector and deputy director of the Accounting Department of the China Securities Regulatory Commission from January 2014 to January 2020. In May 2020, Guosen Securities appointed Deng Ge as the company&#39;s president. Deng had served as the director of the fifth supervision division of the First Department of Supervision of Listed Companies of the China Securities Regulatory Commission. He later served as the first batch of full-time spokespersons of the China Securities Regulatory Commission and the deputy director of the Listing Department of the China Securities Regulatory Commission. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“It’s a two-way street.” A brokerage person explained to Southern Weekend reporters that in brokerages and fund companies, employees who leave the China Securities Regulatory Commission system can get relatively high salaries without having to hold high-level positions; These companies recruit ex-employees to use their connections with regulatory agencies to learn more. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The brokerage firm believes that the problem of the revolving door of politics and business cannot rely solely on legal supervision, &quot;but also on the invisible hand of the market.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Jiyue previously told Southern Weekend reporters, &quot;In a mature registration-based market, if the listed entity cannot attract investors, it will have no value, and the situation of power rent-seeking will be alleviated.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt; p>;In their prospectuses, most of the above-mentioned companies have no or only one sentence brief description of the personnel who have left the CSRC system. Most of the details of the shareholdings of the resigned personnel gradually became clear after inquiries from the exchange. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the release of the &quot;Guidelines&quot;, regulatory agencies have tightened the verification of employees who have left their jobs to invest in companies to be listed, but there are still companies that take risks and conceal all the way. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Shadow Innovation, which was approved to accept IPO applications on October 28, 2020, is just one step away from being listed on the Science and Technology Innovation Board after more than two years of preparation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On November 22, 2022, Shadow Stone Innovation received a 115-word inquiry from the China Securities Regulatory Commission, requiring it to provide additional information on the shareholding status of the natural person &quot;Chen Bin&quot; and the procedures for transferring shares to external parties. Background, motivation, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since the disclosure of IPO application materials (including inquiry response materials), Shadow Stone Innovation has never mentioned Chen Bin. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Economic Information Daily&quot; investigation found that Chen Bin was a person who resigned from the China Securities Regulatory Commission system.

In addition, yesterday, the Guangzhou Municipal Bureau of Housing and Urban-Rural Development issued the &quot;Notice of the General Office of the Guangzhou Municipal People&#39;s Government on Further Strengthening Housing Security for Household Registration Households (Draft for Comments)&quot;, which will jointly improve Guangzhou&#39;s &quot;rental and purchase&quot; housing security. mechanism. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;New Deal Questions and Answers&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Q: What are the specific purchase restriction and non-purchase restriction areas in Guangzhou City in the future? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Answer: The &quot;Notice&quot; states that households registered in Guangzhou are located in Yuexiu, Haizhu, Liwan, Tianhe, and Baiyun (excluding Jianggao Town, Taihe Town, Renhe Town, and Zhongluotan Town), Nansha and other areas still limit the purchase of two houses. This means that except for the areas mentioned above, purchase restrictions are no longer set in other areas of Guangzhou. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Q: Can families who are not residents registered in this city enjoy the liberalized regional dividend? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Answer: The &quot;Notice&quot; clearly states that non-local resident households are limited to purchasing one house in the above-mentioned areas. The conditions for purchasing a house are that they must have paid continuous personal income tax payment certificates or social insurance certificates for 2 years in Guangzhou before the date of purchase. Year. Previously, non-registered residents in Guangzhou were required to meet proof of continuous payment of personal income tax or social insurance certificate for five years to purchase a house in Guangzhou. This new policy lowers the threshold for non-registered residents to purchase houses. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, the &quot;Notice&quot; stipulates that in addition to calculations based on family units, adult single (including divorced) people with household registration in this city in Yuexiu, Haizhu, Liwan, Tianhe, Baiyun (excluding Jianggao Town, Taiyuan) Hezhen, Renhe Town, and Zhongluotan Town) are still limited to purchasing one house. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Q: Will the new policy have any impact on foreigners purchasing houses in Guangzhou? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Answer: Overseas institutions and individuals purchase houses in accordance with the &quot;Opinions on Regulating the Access and Management of Foreign Investment in the Real Estate Market&quot; (Jianfanghuang [2006] No. 171), the &quot;Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development and other departments on the adjustment of foreign investment in the real estate market&quot; &quot;Notice on Relevant Policies for Access and Management&quot; (Jianfang [2015] No. 122) is implemented. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Q: After the issuance of this &quot;Notice&quot;, what will be the timetable for policy implementation? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Answer: The policy adjustment will be implemented from 0:00 on September 20, 2023. If the applicable policy for house purchase qualification review is inconsistent with this notice, this notice shall prevail. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Q: The value-added tax exemption period for personal housing sales has been reduced from 5 years to 2 years. How to implement it? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Answer: The value-added tax exemption period for individual sales of housing in Yuexiu, Haizhu, Liwan, Tianhe, Baiyun, Huangpu, Panyu, Nansha, Zengcheng and other districts will be adjusted from 5 years to 2 years. The applicable determination of the policy is based on The specific review opinions of the tax department shall prevail. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Q: Does the issuance of the &quot;Notice&quot; mean that Guangzhou will realize that everyone has a place to live in the future, and the commercial housing market will be more dominated? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Answer: Guangzhou City has always adhered to the housing security system of &quot;both renting and purchasing&quot;. During the &quot;14th Five-Year Plan&quot; period, Guangzhou City proposed to add 660,000 units (rooms) of affordable housing, which is higher than The number of newly added commercial houses (650,000 units) during the same period made it the city with the largest supply of affordable housing among first-tier cities in the country. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Relevant departments of the Guangzhou Municipal Housing and Urban-Rural Development Bureau introduced that next, the city will further increase the construction and supply of affordable housing, and accelerate the establishment and improvement of public rental housing, affordable rental housing and allotment of affordable housing. A housing security system with housing as the mainstay and both renting and purchasing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, we will continue to provide basic guarantees for public rental housing, raise the income threshold and rental subsidy standards for public rental housing in a timely manner, further expand the scope of public rental housing security, and guide some security targets to solve their housing problems by receiving subsidies. Difficult issues and improve public rental housing security methods. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Vigorously developing affordable rental housing will provide policy support for land, finance, taxation, etc. from the government, and guide various market entities to participate in raising affordable rental housing to alleviate the housing difficulties of new citizens and young people. Accelerate the establishment and improvement of supporting policy systems for allotment of affordable housing. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;[Voice]&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In response to this new policy in Guangzhou’s real estate market, Southern+ reporters immediately contacted experts to explain what impact it will have on the city’s real estate industry in the subsequent stages after the new policy is released. ? Hear what the experts have to say. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ou Jiangbo, director of the Economic Research Institute of the Guangzhou Academy of Social Sciences and deputy director of the Expert Committee of the Guangzhou and Guangdong Real Estate Association:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This adjustment and optimization of real estate development policies is very necessary. And importantly, it will play a very good role in boosting and promoting the real estate market and economic and social development of Guangzhou. Mainly reflected in the following three aspects:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;1. Conducive to the stable and healthy development of Guangzhou’s real estate market&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In view of the huge changes in the development environment at home and abroad and the lagging impact of the three-year epidemic, the current real estate market There is indeed great downward pressure on the market and the macroeconomy, and relevant policies are in great need to be adjusted and optimized. The policies introduced in the early stage, such as &quot;recognizing a house but not a loan&quot; and &quot;lowering interest rates and lowering down payments,&quot; are generally indirect and mild, and the policy strength and effect are not enough. The relaxation of the &quot;purchase restriction and foreign purchase restriction&quot; policy introduced this time is a relaxation of administrative control policies. It is direct, substantive, very important, necessary and timely. I believe it will definitely boost and promote the market. effect. As a national central city and a first-tier city, the steady and healthy development of Guangzhou&#39;s real estate market will also serve as a good example and driving role for other second-, third-, and fourth-tier cities in the country. Therefore, Guangzhou’s policy optimization and adjustment this time is of great significance and deserves high recognition. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2. Conducive to the coordinated and balanced development of the real estate market and housing security&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is worth noting that this policy optimization and adjustment not only optimizes and adjusts the real estate market policy, but also further strengthens the The safeguard policy emphasizes the proper separation, balanced efforts, and mutual promotion of the market and safeguards. It clarifies fuzzy thinking conceptually and strengthens the direction and intensity of work in action, which is conducive to making the market bigger, stronger, and better, as well as better safeguards. It is conducive to the high-quality coordinated development of real estate, economy and society. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;3. It is conducive to the coordinated and integrated development between various districts in Guangzhou and between Guangzhou and surrounding areas&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This policy optimization and adjustment is mainly aimed at the peripheral areas of Guangzhou, while the central urban area and Nansha District are still The implementation of relatively strict purchase restriction measures fully considers the actual conditions of industry, population and real estate market in each district, which well reflects the principle of &quot;district-specific policies&quot; and is conducive to better coordinated development among various districts in Guangzhou. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, with the strong implementation of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area plan, the integration of the Greater Bay Area is accelerating. Currently, more than 50% of the working population in Guangzhou is non-locally registered. Guangzhou is a very open city. , a dynamic city, the appropriate relaxation of policies such as &quot;purchase restrictions and foreign purchase restrictions&quot; fully meets the objective needs of the integrated development of the Greater Bay Area. This optimization and adjustment of real estate policies will not only have great significance in promoting real estate in Guangzhou, but also be of great benefit to the long-term economic, spatial and social development of Guangzhou and the Greater Bay Area. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 20 Sep 2023 19:55:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[悬疑推理作家访谈录丨法医秦明：真正高智商的人不会犯罪]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257192]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-20 19:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Among contemporary Chinese writers of detective novels, &quot;Forensic Physician Qin Ming&quot; is a very unique existence. On the one hand, there are actually many contemporary writers with police work experience, such as Remy, Ah Yi, etc., but authors like Qin Ming who combine their work experience and professional skills with detective novel writing so closely can be called &quot; Unparalleled.&quot; On the other hand, if &quot;Forensic Qin Ming&quot; is regarded as a cultural phenomenon in a broader sense, it started from novels, and later gradually extended to different cultural forms such as film and television, variety shows, and even became the profession of &quot;forensic medicine&quot; in many people&#39;s minds. synonym. Among them, the intertwining of the forensic profession and literary creation has created an amazing cultural communication power. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/c7tnNmyPxBgUYScX14uWqfeo1s7mGgALr6L6XBT2.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;656&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/c7tnNmyPxBgUYScX14uWqfeo1s7mGgALr6L6XBT2.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251280&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Qin Ming is a front-line public security forensic doctor who has examined thousands of corpses for 26 years. He is also a suspense writer and has written the Forensic Qin Ming series, the Hummingbird series, the Night Watch series, and the popular science book series. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Wang Yi/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As a forensic doctor, I am full of awe and curiosity: why did he choose This career? After working in this somewhat mysterious profession for decades, how has your mentality changed? Faced with the large number of literature and film and television dramas about forensics or ghost stories today, what new perspectives can his profession provide? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I have many questions about Qin Ming as a writer: How does he deal with the issues of fiction and reality in novel writing? How does he view the ethical boundaries of writing in crime novels? What is his reading tendency and self-identity towards the genre literary tradition of detective novels? And when I learned during the interview that Qin Ming’s favorite Chinese detective novel writer was Hai Yan, many of the questions I had previously had were solved, and a genealogy of the development of Chinese public security literature gradually became clear before my eyes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, in the latest novel &quot;White Scroll&quot;, we get to know Qin Ming as a father. Compared with the &quot;bad boy&quot; narrative that was popular in detective literature in previous years, &quot;White Scroll&quot; is about Qin Ming. The way children imagine the weak may be more traditional, but it is also more in line with the real concerns and anxieties of contemporary parents. In this novel, the forensic doctor is still the main body of action in the novel, but the father is more able to convey the author&#39;s inner voice. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The chat with Qin Ming lasted less than two hours, but I felt a sense of solidity, trust and security on the other end of the phone. This may be due to the simplicity and sincerity revealed in his words and voice, or it may be due to his many years of professional experience in front-line police work. And during this chat, I also vaguely felt the possibility of another understanding of the sense of reality in the novel &quot;Forensic Qin Ming&quot;. This sense of reality does not lie in whether the story itself is &quot;purely fictional&quot;, but in a kind of Perseverance in writing attitude and inner belief in justice. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Forensic Medicine in Reality&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Qin Mingyou Well, since the publication of your first novel &quot;Corpse Whisperer&quot; in 2012, through the publication of more than a dozen novels, the adaptation of many film and television dramas, and now the very popular variety show &quot;Jobs -&quot; Forensic Season&quot;. Forensic medicine, which was originally a relatively niche and somewhat mysterious profession, has now gradually become well-known to the public. Why did you choose the profession of forensic medicine in the first place? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Qin Ming: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;When I was in middle school, I basically didn’t know much about forensic medicine. My father was a policeman and my mother was a nurse. My father had a special interest in me. I had the complex and expectation that a son should inherit his father&#39;s career and become a police officer. However, my mother felt that being a police officer was too dangerous. Later, when I applied for a volunteer, I compromised and applied for a forensic medicine job. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;When you take an anatomy class for the first time, What are the scenes and feelings like? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Qin Ming: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I went to college in 1998 and began to study in the professional field of forensic medicine. In the process of studying and working, I gradually realized the forensic medicine importance. For example, the first story in my novel &quot;The Corpse Whisperer&quot; tells the story of a fight between several young people, and one person was stabbed to death. It was originally a very simple case, but it required forensic identification of the tools that caused the injuries in order to accurately determine their respective legal responsibilities. The key point is that the deceased in this case was an acquaintance of mine, so it posed a great psychological challenge to me. This was my first anatomy class, and I was very impressed. I was deeply shocked by the importance of forensic work, and from then on I set my life ambition: I must be a good forensic doctor in my life. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;When you later engaged in forensic work, Will there be any changes in your mind? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Qin Ming: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;At first I would feel very angry with the criminal and hate the evil as much as I hate them. But the sign of a true maturity of a forensic doctor is his indifference. He will not pay too much attention to things other than the case. Instead, he will put all his energy on the autopsy and try his best to find clues. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;That is, as forensic doctors continue to accumulate work experience, Not only has the professional and technical level been improved, but also the entire personality has been tempered and changed. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Qin Ming: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I think it should be like this. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Before, I thought forensic medicine was a type of doctor. The main task is to perform an autopsy. But through your novels and the &quot;Forensic Season&quot; program, I discovered that forensic doctors also have to undertake a lot of work in on-site investigation, physical evidence identification, and even case reasoning. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/ACJAPjfdzIYaZVxRhcxS9mLdD2WvZgY9LZ5lBvRy.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/ACJAPjfdzIYaZVxRhcxS9mLdD2WvZgY9LZ5lBvRy.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251281&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In 2023, forensic doctor Qin Ming will participate in the reality show &quot;Forensic Medicine Season 2&quot; as a guest. The picture shows the poster of the show. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(data map/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Qin Ming:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Yes, our Chinese public security organs have set up As a forensic department, public security forensic doctors must participate in case scene investigation and case investigation. In some Western countries, forensic doctors, as independent inspection agencies, usually only need to identify three pieces of information: cause of death, time of death, and instrument of injury, and generally will not express opinions on other than these three issues. However, in our investigation process, all police types must play their maximum role within their professional scope, so that they can solve the case most efficiently. We often say that the center of a murder scene is the corpse, and the forensic doctor is the only police officer who comes into contact with the corpse, so the forensic doctor will have the core information of the entire scene. Therefore, our forensic doctors often have to participate in more case analysis and reasoning processes. This also ensures that our various police departments work together as a whole to maximize the effectiveness of the team and solve cases with the highest efficiency. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I wrote a story in my book about the murder of a family of five. The murderer used knives to kill the host and hostess, the host’s mother, nanny and children. The five bodies were all covered with knives. The injuries were fatal. Only the nanny and the old lady&#39;s heads still had scars from the hammer, and they were still injured after death. When encountering such a case, many Western forensic institutions will feel that the cause of death, time of death, and the instrument of injury are very clear when conducting examinations, and will not proceed to the next step of reasoning. But our forensic doctors will continue to reason based on these clues: Why did the murderer hit these two people&#39;s heads with a hammer after they died? The biggest possibility is that it is reinforced damage, just to ensure that the deceased will die, and if she is not dead, she will be hit twice. So under what circumstances would reinforced damage be used? That means the deceased knew the murderer. So why only use reinforced damage on old ladies and nannies? It means that only two of them in the family of five know the murderer, and no other family members know him. Who could the murderer be? We speculated that he might be a vegetable vendor in the market, who usually only has contact with old ladies and nannies. As a result, we greatly reduced the scope of investigation and improved the police&#39;s efficiency in solving crimes. Therefore, I say that allowing forensic doctors to be more involved in the entire process of investigation, reasoning and solving cases is actually an institutional arrangement that is more suitable for our country&#39;s national conditions and can greatly improve the efficiency of solving cases. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;What a wonderful reasoning. In many other current criminal investigation dramas, suspense films, or mystery novels, the role of forensic doctors is also set up, and they are given important functions in solving crimes. However, most of the forensic characters in these film and television dramas or novels are women - such as the female forensic doctor Gao Yanan in the TV series &quot;White Night&quot; (2017), and the female forensic doctor in Hu Yanyun&#39;s novel &quot;Sweeping Rat Ridge&quot; (2020). Forensic doctor Lei Rong et al. I wonder what the gender ratio is between men and women in the real forensic profession? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Qin Ming: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Movies and TV dramas may be based on dramatic considerations, so many female forensic roles are set up. However, in the actual gender composition of the profession, the majority of forensic doctors are men. The ratio of men to women in Anhui Province is about 10:1. The advantage of men engaging in forensic medicine may be that many autopsies are actually laborious work, and sometimes they need to go to the remote mountains and forests in the middle of the night. But female forensic doctors also have their own advantages. For example, they are often more meticulous and can handle some details better. At the same time, a lot of the work of forensic doctors is to assess injuries. When it comes to female injured people, female forensic doctors also have their own conveniences. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;When it comes to forensic-themed film and television dramas, in addition to urban themes In addition, the profession of forensic medicine is now increasingly entering the public eye, which in turn has led to the popularity of another type of film and television dramas, which are works with ancient ghosts or autopsy personnel as the protagonists. From the early &quot;The Punisher of the Song Dynasty&quot; (2005) to the recent &quot;The Imperial Gift of Xiaowu&quot; (2021), even Gongsun Ce, who was beside Bao Zheng, had to some extent the ability to perform autopsies. In my opinion, this is actually using some modern forensic technology and spirit to reimagine an ancient puppeteer. Do you usually watch these film and television works? What do you think of these works? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Qin Ming: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;As you said, the essence of the &quot;criminal officials&quot; or &quot;husbands&quot; in these ancient film and television dramas is still based on modern Artistic image processing performed by forensic medicine. To give two examples, one is that according to ancient customs, in most cases corpses cannot be dissected, and the case can only be concluded through autopsy. Of course, for many cases, autopsy can also roughly clarify the basic situation of the case. Unless there are doubts that cannot be resolved by autopsy, the body can be dissected. Another is that the ancient corpses only had the function of cleaning and moving corpses, but did not have the function of identification. Only officials are qualified to conduct autopsies and identifications. In the ancient status hierarchy, wu Zuo was often a pariah and did not have such qualifications. He did not even have the right to fill in the autopsy records, while our modern forensic doctors have the right to identify.所以你说的两部古装影视剧，其实差别又很大。 《大宋提刑官》中的宋慈是正四品的提点刑律官，《御赐小仵作》中的主角是个小仵作，两个人的工作职能、权力范围其实都是不同的。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;秦明：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;我最喜欢的作家这么多年没变过，就是海岩，但准确地说他写的不是侦探小说。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;嗯，其实海岩是更广义上的公安题材写作，然后在里面融入了相当多言情小说的类型元素。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;秦明：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;对的，他是那种偏都市的风格。我看的第一本海岩小说是《便衣警察》，小说写得很早，但我是在2000年上大学之后才“入坑”的。后来第二本是《一场风花雪月的事》，还有《死于青春》《玉观音》《深牢大狱》，包括后来的《舞者》《长安盗》，我都是第一时间买来读的，最喜欢《深牢大狱》这一本。后来焦俊艳去演电影《长安盗》，她是演我第一部网剧的女主角，而且也是安徽人，我们很熟，所以我听说她去演这部海岩小说改编的电影就很兴奋。除了海岩，我也看雷米的《心理罪》系列、周浩晖《死亡通知单》系列，包括马伯庸的小说，我不知道算不算推理小说，但我也很喜欢看。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;听说你和雷米还有一些有趣的交往经历？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;秦明：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;雷米是刑警学院的老师，我是刑警学院的学生，我是大学毕业之后到刑警学院读了一个双学士，所以虽然我和雷米年龄差不多，但他确实做过我的老师。另外，我写完第一本小说之后寄给他看，他提了三条意见，让我至今印象深刻：一是请搞清楚“的、地、得”的用法；二是少看同类型小说，继续保持自己的风格；三是做一个能写很久的写作者。我觉得他当初提的这三条建议，我基本做到了吧。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;真是非常坦诚的建议。你会觉得雷米笔下方木的犯罪心理画像更偏幻想和虚构，而你的“法医秦明”系列更偏现实主义吗？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;秦明：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;我并不认为方木这个人物是完全地虚构，一方面，犯罪心理画像技术在具体犯罪研究和破案过程中也确实存在；另一方面，我觉得方木身上可能是集合了很多优秀公安干警的成功案例，并不是完全出于虚构。相比之下，我的“法医秦明”系列，可能因为法医学是自然科学，更容易让人信服。我给你讲科学道理，得出破案结论，你觉得这是可信的。但心理分析，同样也是建立在科学的基础上。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“擦掉足迹会留下更多擦拭的痕迹”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;如果把“法医秦明”系列也放到侦探小说的文学传统中来看，从柯南·道尔的“福尔摩斯探案”以来，其实侦探福尔摩斯具备两项技能：一个是巨细靡遗的现场观察能力，脚印、指纹、血迹、毛发、烟灰，任何一点细节都不会逃过福尔摩斯的眼睛，而这些往往能构成其最后破案的关键性线索；另一个就是其强大的逻辑推理能力，正如福尔摩斯自己所说：“逻辑学家从一滴水就能推测出它是来自大西洋还是尼亚加拉瀑布的，而无需亲眼见到或听说过大西洋或尼亚加拉瀑布。生命就是一条巨大的链条，只要见到其中的一环，我们就可以推想出整个链条的特性。”如果从福尔摩斯小说所开创的这两条文学传统来看，“法医秦明”系列似乎是继承并发展了第一条传统，并将这种传统和一个非常具体的、现代化的职业相结合，写出了某种真实感。你对侦探小说的这两条传统怎么看？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;秦明：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;我觉得不同作家有不同的写作侧重和关注点。经常有人问我是本格派还是社会派，我说我哪一派都不属于，因为我写的这些东西不是为了推理而推理，我是为了破案而推理。如果一定要概括一下的话，我认为可以叫“现实推理”。一方面，现实物证是推理的前提和依据；另一方面，物证和推理相结合，最后的目的都是破案。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;现在本格推理小说中很重要的一个分支就是“密室杀人”。而在你的《幸存者》中，第四案就是“夺命密室”。在《白卷》中，第十案也叫“断肠密室”。当然，我觉得你小说中所说的“密室”，和现在“新本格”小说中的密室概念还是有很大差别。你怎么看待这种推理小说中的密室设计？如果说在“新本格”推理小说中，“密室”往往意味着某种脑洞大开的奇思妙想与严谨的逻辑推理的结合，那么在法医侦探的眼中，密室是可能存在的吗？还是所谓“密室”，一定会留下凶手故意伪造的痕迹和线索？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;秦明：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;我非常感动，因为你真的看懂了我的小说，就是这个意思。我们经常说只要有人出现在案发现场，就一定会产生物质交换。比如你设置了一个很复杂的密室，我们一般管它叫“封闭现场”，你可以不留下足迹吗？很多人说擦掉足迹就可以啊，但擦掉足迹会留下更多擦拭的痕迹，犯罪嫌疑人想得越多，在现场多余动作越多，给警方留下的线索和证据就越多。就像经常很多人问我有没有“高智商犯罪”，我说真正高智商的人不会犯罪。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;提到“高智商犯罪”，我想到紫金陈的小说，他有一本小说叫《无证之罪》，其中有一个非常有意思的想象，就是犯罪者是一个精通物鉴和法医两个领域的顶级专家，这样的人去犯罪，现场不会留下一点线索和证据。而破案的侦探则是一名大学数学老师，有着超强的逻辑推理能力，于是形成了“推理之王”解决“无证之罪”这种有点类似于传统武侠小说中巅峰对决的情节设计。你怎么看待这一类的文学想象？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;秦明：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;不同的小说家都有自己不同的特长和不同的小说写法，紫金陈的小说我也很喜欢读，不过我们的写法可能不一样。他善于做推理的安排，而我的特长是写法医。在我的实际工作中，不存在“无证之罪”，“无证”就是“无罪”。只有找到证据，形成完整的证据链，才能定罪，因此我的小说可能会更注重证据一些。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;在你早期的小说中，各个故事之间彼此相对独立性更高一些，只是由同一批法医将这些不同的案件、不同的小故事串联起来，某种程度上来看，它可能更接近于一组彼此关系密切的“短篇小说集”。你在《幸存者》的“序”中也说过，“法医秦明”系列的本色之一，就是“以个案为基础，加入穿插全书的主线”。而在最新的这本《白卷》中，我明显能感受到整部小说的整体性设计，首尾呼应、环环相扣，一个复杂的长篇小说的结构已然形成，这样一种从短篇故事连缀到长篇小说的变化是你有意为之的结果吗？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;秦明：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;是的，其实“法医秦明”系列小说是成卷的，前六本《尸语者》《无声的证词》《第十一根手指》《清道夫》《幸存者》《偷窥者》都是“万象卷”，写的是人间万象，所以更接近短篇小说集的写法。然后从《天谴者》开始，《天谴者》《遗忘者》《玩偶》和《白卷》，是“众生卷”，我在写法上会有很大不同，就是每一本书虽然还是有好几个案件故事，但整体上围绕一个社会问题来写。比如《天谴者》主要聚焦的是社会责任感，《遗忘者》主要聚焦腐朽的女德思想，《玩偶》聚焦的是家暴，而这一本《白卷》主要是聚焦的是亲子关系里的沟通问题。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我写小说另外一个变化在于，我在“众生卷”里减少了命案的篇幅，而增加了其他意外死亡的故事，主要原因有三：一是老秦本身就是写实派的作者，而实际情况中，命案的确是越来越少了；二是法医工作绝对不仅仅是在命案中发挥作用，在死亡方式的判断和整个诉讼过程中都能发挥不可替代的作用，我希望我的读者可以看到法医在其他更多领域发挥作用的故事；三是法医工作博大精深，除了现场分析之外，还有很多其他的案件需要法医贡献力量，我想让我的读者全面地了解法医学专业。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;你在《白卷》里面写的很多是关于父母和子女之间的日常相处、代际隔阂的问题，你这本书对于亲子问题的关注，和你作为一名父亲的身份有关系吗？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;秦明：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;这个问题不太好回答，因为我自己和我父亲一样，在孩子的成长过程中是缺位的。因为工作原因，我以前一年要出差两百多天，现在案子少了，也要出差几十天到一百天。所以平时工作也挺忙的，对孩子的教育过程我自认为还是属于半缺位的状态。但我还是很关注这个问题，希望通过小说引起大家对于青少年的关心，我是想去触发大家的思考，而不想去说教。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;

People&#39;s Assessor. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Not long ago, the Supreme People&#39;s Court issued the &quot;Several Provisions on People&#39;s Assessors with Specialized Knowledge to Participate in the Trial of Environmental Resources Cases&quot; on July 27, 2023 (hereinafter referred to as the &quot;Regulations&quot;). This is not only a special demand for environmental resource cases (hereinafter referred to as &quot;environmental resource cases&quot;) that have surged in number in recent years and are extremely professional, but also a new expansion of the people&#39;s assessor system. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the regulations were promulgated, Baicheng City in Jilin Province, Yangjiang City in Guangdong Province, Weichang County in Hebei Province, Lijin County in Shandong Province, Hunnan District in Shenyang City in Liaoning Province, Heilongjiang Forestry District and other places successively held court hearings on the province’s first cases involving persons with disabilities. People&#39;s assessors with specialized knowledge participate in environmental investment cases. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The jury system has only played a role in China&#39;s judicial field for a short time. In August 2004, the Standing Committee of the National People&#39;s Congress reviewed and passed the &quot;Decision on Improving the People&#39;s Assessor System&quot;, which clarified the people&#39;s assessor system for the first time, and China had &quot;unrobed judges.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the phenomenon of people&#39;s jurors &quot;accompanying the case but not trying the case, trying the case without deliberation&quot; and &quot;having no purpose&quot; is common, and has been criticized by the society and the legal circles. In April 2018, the Jury Law was officially promulgated, establishing principles such as random selection of jurors, term limits, and the &quot;grand collegial panel system&quot;, which has changed the shortcomings of the past to a certain extent. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Prior to this, China’s judicial system has set up an expert assistant system. The Criminal Procedure Law, Civil Procedure Law and other specialized laws revised after 2012 also increasingly advocate “expert assistants with specialized knowledge”. People appear in court.&quot; However, whether they are &quot;experts&quot; or &quot;people with specialized knowledge&quot;, they are all intended to solve professional and technical problems in the trial, and they all fall into the category of witnesses and evidence. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In recent years, in some cases in special fields, more and more &quot;expert&quot; people&#39;s jurors have appeared in collegial panels. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Chen Yongsheng, a professor of law at Peking University, said that the collegial panel consults professionals during the trial of cases, which has always existed in judicial practice. This institutionalization will help improve the professional trial level of environmental and capital-related cases. &quot;It is foreseeable that people with specialized knowledge will serve as jurors in other highly professional fields in the future.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;The &quot;thrush&quot; whose identity is questionable&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;What kind of birds are the &quot;thrush&quot; and &quot;spotted water sparrow&quot;? Is it a thrush? Is it the same bird? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;In a case of illegal hunting of ferret badgers and &quot;thrushes&quot; heard by the Hanyuan County Court in Sichuan, the presiding judge He Gang encountered a problem. When the trial opened in May 2023, the court invited Li Zhihua, a staff member of the County Forestry Bureau, and Cao Lixiang, a staff member of the Qianyu Town Animal Health Supervision Office, to participate in the trial. Their identities were &quot;professional people&#39;s jurors.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is the first environmental investment case in Sichuan to be heard by &quot;professional people&#39;s assessors&quot;, and it occurred before the regulations of the Supreme People&#39;s Court were promulgated. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Hanyuan County Procuratorate accused Li Moumou of Malie Village of illegally manufacturing and possessing guns since 2018, and using slingshots and nail guns to hunt and kill multiple &quot;Thrushes&quot; and &quot;thrushes&quot; since 2020. A &quot;flower nose pattern&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Because the case is not serious, this case adopts a simplified procedure, and the collegial panel adopts a &quot;1 (judge) + 2 (people&#39;s assessor)&quot; structure. The presiding judge, He Gang, is in his thirties and has served as a judge for 8 years. Although he has rich trial experience, he has insufficient biological knowledge. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The fur involved in the case was identified by Sichuan Agricultural University and was indeed a ferret and badger, a wild animal protected by the country’s “Three Certainties”. However, the thrush is a national second-level protected animal. What kind of bird the criminal mentioned as the &quot;thrush&quot; and how many there are are related to conviction and sentencing. Cao Lixiang and Li Zhihua, a staff member of the Hanyuan County Forestry Bureau, are here to help solve this problem. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Cao Lixiang is a veterinarian with 30 years of experience. Since 2015, he has been recommended by the town government and selected as a people&#39;s assessor of the Hanyuan County Court. So far, he has participated in 20 or 30 court trials, but most of them were grassroots civil disputes. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This case in May 2023 was the first time that Cao Lixiang and Li Zhihua used their professional backgrounds to serve as jurors as &quot;people&#39;s jurors with specialized knowledge.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Cao Lixiang and Li Zhihua read the case files provided by the court in advance. During the trial, Cao Lixiang asked a number of questions: What gun did you use to shoot? Where did you get the call? How many shots were fired? Was it one hit, or several hits? Where did the ferret badger hit? After questioning, it was compared with the captured ferret and badger pelts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past few years of practice, Cao Lixiang has learned to check witness and physical evidence, &quot;to see if it is consistent with his confession. To prevent scapegoating.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Cao Lixiang further asked about the characteristics of the &quot;Thrush&quot; that Li Moumou hunted: What was the fur like? What color is it? Where does feather color change? What are the characteristics of the head, tail, and trunk? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for the issue of &quot;Thrush&quot;, Li Moumou&#39;s expression included different dialect names such as &quot;Thrush&quot; and &quot;Thrush&quot;. Cao Lixiang and Li Zhihua said that in rural areas of Hanyuan County, the &quot;thrush (sound mi) bird&quot; does not necessarily correspond to a real thrush, but may also be a water sparrow or other birds. There are many types of thrushes in biology. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Cao Lixiang hopes to determine whether the bird Li killed is a thrush, a second-level national protected animal, through biological characteristics, living habits, flight height and movements. However, since the characteristics confessed by Li Moumou are inconsistent with the biological characteristics of the thrush, and there was no physical evidence at the time of the crime, reasonable doubt cannot be ruled out. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the end, due to insufficient evidence, the court did not recognize the fact that Li Moumou &quot;hunted&quot; the thrush. Li Moumou was convicted of illegal hunting for hunting ferret badgers and was sentenced to four months in prison. In addition to the two charges of illegally manufacturing guns and illegally possessing guns, he was punished for several crimes and was sentenced to three years and six months in prison. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/19/ys29RW2wJIALlNMgvfDZyasJxXkL6kOvmOn7Augq.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;672&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/19/ys29RW2wJIALlNMgvfDZyasJxXkL6kOvmOn7Augq.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251256&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;After the people&#39;s jurors with professional knowledge expressed their opinions, the Hanyuan County Court in Sichuan did not recognize the fact that a defendant &quot;hunted&quot; the thrush. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(People&#39;s Vision/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;The &quot;thing&quot; that cannot speak&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; He Gang said that environmental investment cases are different from ordinary cases. &quot;Most of the time, things that affect the environment are a kind of &#39;object&#39;. Objects cannot speak, and they involve professional problems. For example, if a plant in a place dies, it may be There are many reasons for the accumulation.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If the judge looks up the information by himself, it will be limited to the knowledge structure, which will either consume time, or be inaccurate and unauthoritative. At this time, it is crucial for someone with specialized knowledge to provide professional advice. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another characteristic of environmental investment cases is that no one pays attention to them in the early stage. By the time they are discovered, the cycle of contamination or damage has been very long. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sun Youhai, executive director of the China Green Development Research Institute of Tianjin University, was the director of the Bill Office of the Environment and Resources Protection Committee of the National People&#39;s Congress. He published a paper in 2022 &quot;The Expert Juror System in the Context of Environmental Justice Specialization&quot; Study&quot; mentioned that environmental resource cases have complex causal relationships, resulting in long trial times. Due to the lack of professional knowledge, parties may easily doubt the fairness of court trials, affecting judicial credibility. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, Sun Youhai took the 2007 exhaust gas case from a mining and chemical company in Fujian. From 2010 to 2012, it went through prosecution, first-instance judgment, appeal, remand for retrial, second-instance judgment, application for retrial, and remand for retrial. The tortuous process of the retrial and the retrial judgment caused dissatisfaction among the parties involved. “One of the core reasons for the long and repetitive trial process is that the appraisal opinions of different appraisal agencies are inconsistent. However, environmental judges do not have professional environmental knowledge, so they cannot make accurate judgments on the appraisal opinions in a timely manner, which leads to the judicial organs’ inconsistencies in case trials and judgments. It is difficult to characterize the case.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From the actual trial of environmental and capital-related cases, it is necessary to improve the professionalism of jurors. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As early as April 2019, the Supreme People’s Court issued a judicial interpretation of the Jury Law, which stipulated that “if the type of case requires people’s jurors with corresponding professional knowledge to participate in collegial panel trials, they may be The circumstances of the case shall be determined by random selection from the list of people&#39;s jurors who meet professional needs.&quot; Since then, &quot;expert jurors&quot; have been selected for cases in the fields of intellectual property, minors, finance, medical disputes, and network technology. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In comparison, environmental investment cases involve chemical, biological, forestry, animal husbandry, minerals, land, water resources and other subcategories. They are more professional and difficult for laymen to judge. The needs are also more urgent. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;The regulations issued by the Supreme Law on environmental capital cases clarify that &quot;people&#39;s jurors with specialized knowledge&quot; refer to those who have specialized knowledge in the field of environmental resources, or who have experience in environmental resources administrative departments, scientific research institutes, higher education institutions, etc. Jurors who have worked in institutions, enterprises, social organizations and other units for more than three years. This regulation will be implemented from August 1, 2023. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, before the regulations were promulgated, courts at all levels across the country had already conducted many relevant explorations and practices. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The People&#39;s Court of Qingzhen City, Guizhou Province established China&#39;s first ecological protection court in 2007. In December 2010, the court invited two people to hear a case of illegal discharge of sewage from a paper mill. The &quot;people&#39;s assessors&quot; include Shuai Jiang, a senior environmental engineer and director of Guiyang&#39;s Two Lakes and One Reservoir Management Bureau, and Liu Xiaojing, a Ph.D. in environmental protection. An expert advisory committee was convened to conduct demonstrations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2014, the Wanzhou District Court of Chongqing approved the appointment of four environmental experts including Yao Weizhi, deputy director of the Fisheries Resources Research Institute of Southwest University, and Ren Ping, director of the Wanzhou District Forestry Science Institute, to serve as jurors He has participated in the trial of a series of cases including the Fengjie County electromagnetic radiation case, the yew pollution case, and the Kaixian cattle farm land pollution case. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some places are also actively building expert databases for environmental jurors. For example, the Higher People&#39;s Court of Guizhou Province issued the &quot;Regulations on the Participation of Environmental Expert Jurors in Case Trials&quot; in early 2014 and established an expert database for ecological and environmental jurors. From January 2016 to December 2017, Chongqing courts at all levels hired a total of 18 experts as expert jurors to participate in the collegial panel hearing of 124 cases. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;By 2022, it will gradually become a trend to invite experts with environmental protection expertise to serve as jurors. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Randomness and fairness&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In 2018, the first special legal jury law on the people&#39;s assessor system was promulgated, which was widely praised by the legal community. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Chen Yongsheng, a law professor at Peking University, believes that a very important point of the jury law is to strengthen the randomness of jurors. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past, people&#39;s jurors in courts at all levels were mainly recommended by their units and grassroots organizations, or jurors recommended themselves. After the promulgation of the Juror Law, although the recommendation model has been retained, the main method of selection is that the judicial administrative agency, together with the courts and the public security agency, randomly selects from the list of local residents, conducts a qualification review, and then submits it to the Standing Committee of the People&#39;s Congress at the same level for approval and approval. appointment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Chen Yongsheng also believes that before the law was enacted, the jury seats in many places were fixed and full-time for a long time. They were familiar with the judges and had difficulty in functioning. The random generation of jurors helps prevent judicial corruption. &quot;The laws of psychology show that the possibility of corruption is higher when a person is dealing with acquaintances. On the contrary, in front of a stranger, if the other party violates the law, the other party will You may still have concerns about reporting and seeking improper benefits.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the 1980s and 1990s, China&#39;s legal system had a &quot;negative attitude&quot; towards the jury system. Academic circles call it the &quot;low ebb&quot; of the jury system. At that time, He Jiahong, who later became a law professor at Renmin University of China, was still studying in the United States and had begun to understand the American jury system. The Simpson case that occurred in the 1990s gave great inspiration to the Chinese legal community. &quot;It turns out that cases in the United States can still be tried in this way and let some ordinary people decide.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the Jury Law, the court selects 5 times the number of proposed jurors as candidates, and the number of jurors actually selected is not less than 3 times the number of judges of the court. In some pilot courts, the number of jurors is even 10 times that of judges. This is precisely to enhance the broadness and representativeness of the people&#39;s assessors. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2018, the Juror Law stipulated that jurors must be at least 28 years old, which is higher than the 23 years old requirement in 2004. Chen Yongsheng once proposed that based on the principle of &quot;same trial&quot;, the age limit should be expanded. &quot;This is to expand and enhance the representativeness of judges. Because of the existing regulations, defendants under the age of 28 do not have the identity composition corresponding to Homogeneous jurors”. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Behind this proposal, the inherent spirit of the jury system is reflected - jurors should not only be selected from legal professionals, such as university professors and judicial assistants, but also should introduce folk wisdom. In other words, let &quot;lay people&quot; participate in the trial. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;&quot;Why should a jury system be established? Because the way people who have studied law has formatted their minds to think about problems, they are more rational than ordinary people. And private juries Based on perceptual life experience, a judge can fully understand the cause-and-effect connections and feelings and reactions of the defendant when he behaves better than a judge.&quot; Chen Yongsheng said that this will help the case judgment to be more in line with the legal provisions, and also help the court to maximize its effectiveness within the legal framework. Taking into account the humanity and personal feelings of the parties involved. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In recent years, the judicial interpretation of the Supreme People&#39;s Court has changed the standard for determining &quot;justifiable defense&quot; due to the public opinion caused by many major cases, and it has become closer to human ethics. &quot;If the jury system is used properly, it can achieve the organic unity of national law and human relations, national law and natural justice.&quot; Chen Yongsheng said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Anglo-American jury system is composed of one team for each case, and a new team is formed for each case. Jurors in the civil law system also have a term limit of no more than two terms. &quot;Whether it is the common law system or the civil law system, you cannot always serve as a juror to prevent jurors from changing from laymen to experts. Otherwise, the advantages that jurors may have as laymen cannot be used.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to statistics from the Supreme People&#39;s Court, as of 2021, there are more than 316,000 people&#39;s jurors across the country, an increase of about 50% from 2018. He Jiahong believes that in recent years, the number of cases nationwide has increased rapidly. Since 2019, the total number of cases accepted by people&#39;s courts at all levels across the country has been more than 30 million every year. &quot;The number of cases involving specialized knowledge in various fields is also increasing. Therefore, the courts are facing the problem of insufficient manpower and brainpower.&quot; He Jiahong believes that the introduction of regulations this time to invite people with specialized knowledge to serve as people&#39;s assessors can effectively solve the problem of court manpower and brainpower. Lack of brain power. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/19/MAnwC42xdiZsLdSFdeEYFFPyxO9AjO6hm41DCkSr.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;865&quot; height= &quot;577&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/19/MAnwC42xdiZsLdSFdeEYFFPyxO9AjO6hm41DCkSr.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251254&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;People&#39;s assessors Cao Lixiang (middle) and Li Zhihua (right) are looking at relevant evidence. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Hanyuan County People&#39;s Court/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;From &quot;expert&quot; to &quot;professional knowledge&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt; /h4>; &lt;p>;“This new regulation only institutionalizes a method that was widely used in previous practice in a certain type of case.” Chen Yongsheng said that British Justice Dan Dan was widely recognized by the Chinese legal circle. Lord Ning also mentioned in his book &quot;Due Process of the Law&quot; that an important function of the jury is to hire professional jurors to resolve professional issues. &quot;It is foreseeable that the use of people with specialized knowledge to serve as jurors will also be implemented in other more professional fields in the future, or corresponding regulations will be introduced.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Chen Yongsheng once served as a consulting expert and was invited by the Public Security Bureau to discuss some environmental protection cases, but he admitted that he could only express opinions on the legal issues involved. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2022, Chen Yongsheng encountered a criminal case involving pollution caused by the accumulation of construction waste. The procuratorate hoped to determine whether the suspect committed a crime by understanding the degree of harm and whether to prosecute. &quot;I don&#39;t know whether a kind of garbage is harmful to the environment. I think construction waste is nothing more than steel bars and cement and should be harmless. But professionals say that the accumulation of construction waste will damage the soil and cultivated land, and it will also be damaged after being wet by rain. Some toxic substances will be released. This requires specialized researchers to understand.&quot; In the end, the opinions of environmental experts played an important reference role. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2021, before the regulations were promulgated, Tianjin University Law School was entrusted to hold an expert seminar on &quot;Several Provisions of the Supreme People&#39;s Court on the Participation of Expert People&#39;s Assessors in the Trial of Environmental Resources Cases&quot; (Draft for Comments). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the final regulations, &quot;expert people&#39;s assessors&quot; were changed to &quot;people&#39;s assessors with specialized knowledge.&quot; The change in title was based on practical considerations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Chen Yongsheng&#39;s view, the so-called experts should at least have a master&#39;s degree or even a doctorate, work in a university or scientific research institution, and have an intermediate or even deputy senior professional title. &quot;The ideal situation is of course for experts to serve as jurors. But there are more than 3,000 courts across the country, and more than 90% of them are grassroots courts. If the status is limited to experts, the threshold is too high, and grassroots courts obviously cannot do it.&quot; In fact, the grassroots courts cannot do it. , the professional issues in most cases only need to be identified by people with relevant professional background and experience. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, &quot;person with specialized knowledge&quot; is also a relatively common term in law. There are many provisions in the current Criminal Procedure Law and Civil Procedure Law to &quot;hire persons with specialized knowledge&quot; to appear in court or Make an appraisal. Chen Yongsheng explained, &quot;This &#39;person with specialized knowledge&#39; is called an expert assistant in the legal world, and is sometimes called an expert witness.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But obviously, these all belong to the category of witnesses, and are not the same as those introduced in the collegial panel. Knowledgeable jurors are two different judicial paths and directions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zeng Xiangbin, a lawyer at Hubei Huanyuan Law Firm, has conducted dozens of public interest litigations on environmental investment cases. &quot;I have not found a case where professional issues have affected the fair trial of the court.&quot; &quot;The existing litigation system is sufficient, and there is no need to find an additional professional person.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Chen Yongsheng does not agree with this. Chen Yongsheng believes that the expert witness and judicial appraisal system serve both parties in the dispute. The appraisal reports issued by each party are generally beneficial to them, and the expert witnesses invited are often also beneficial to them. In the same case, the appraisal results of the plaintiff and the defendant are sometimes opposite, and even the procuratorate’s appraisal results are inconsistent several times. “At this time, jurors with professional knowledge stand in a neutral position to judge the prosecution and defense.” It is necessary to distinguish the true from the false and eliminate the false while retaining the true.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sun Youhai also pointed out in the paper that expert assistants are only responsible for the parties, and their neutrality and independence are lacking. This is different for jurors with professional knowledge. On the one hand, they can scientifically determine the evidence and facts of the case; On the other hand, it can also effectively supervise the trial work of the court on behalf of the people. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Equality of power with judges must be ensured&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The regulations announced by the Supreme People’s Court this time will apply to basic people’s courts and intermediate people’s courts. When hearing environmental resources cases, clear requirements are put forward for the number of &quot;people&#39;s jurors with specialized knowledge&quot;, and requirements are also put forward for the number of collegial panels depending on the circumstances of the case, which is basically consistent with the principles of the Jury Law. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Both He Jiahong and Chen Yongsheng believe that although the legislation is relatively complete, the biggest problem in judicial practice is that the jury system has not been fully implemented. In recent years, some cases with significant social impact have not all adopted the jury system. Chen Yongsheng believes that &quot;Although the case handling agency also made excuses, for example, it was worried that the jurors would not be able to manipulate and make decisions, their excuses were not convincing. It violated the legislative purpose of the Juror Law.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; He Jiahong also expressed regret, &quot;Including judicial reforms in countries with civil law systems such as France, major and serious criminal cases have adopted the jury system. However, in our country for many years, some major cases have not required juries, but daily ordinary cases have used juries. &quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He and some legal experts were invited by the court to observe some court trials. One expert said, &quot;This case is not very important, and the defendant also pleaded guilty and there is no dispute. Why do we need jurors? ?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He Jiahong believes that these cases with great social impact were originally excellent opportunities to promote the concept of the jury system to the society, but they were wasted. &quot;With extremely high attention, higher requirements have also been put forward on how court leaders and judges manage the collegiate bench.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The reason is that Chen Yongsheng said that many cases need to be reported to special committees, adjudicatory committees, judges, deans, and even to higher-level courts, political and legal committees and other higher-level units before decisions can be made. result. “The decision-making power in many cases does not lie with the collegial panel.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Chen Yongsheng said, &quot;The collegial panel has no decision-making power, let alone jurors. Even if the jurors express their opinions, they cannot affect the outcome of the case, which leads to the jurors being unwilling to actively exercise their right to serve as a jury.&quot;&lt;/p >; &lt;p>;Specifically when it comes to the trial of environmental resources cases, Sun Youhai pointed out that a guarantee system should be provided for people&#39;s jurors with specialized knowledge, including the right to participate in the trial, the right to know the case and the right to vote on the case, to ensure that the jurors&#39; rights and The equal power of judges allows them to &quot;devote themselves whole-heartedly to the jury work of the case and have no worries when performing their jury duties.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 20 Sep 2023 18:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[在野党党首绝食抗议，日本核污水排海再引韩国朝野纷争]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257212]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-20 17:39:44&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/20/uMBu5GmaGxoYRYoG1X1WJetEUJcrCreencsaMH7u.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/uMBu5GmaGxoYRYoG1X1WJetEUJcrCreencsaMH7u. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251307&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>; (Visual China/Picture) &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Congressman Lee, you are no longer alone.&quot; On the afternoon of September 19, 2023, former South Korean President Moon Jae-in appeared at a hospital in Seoul to visit Lee Jae-myung, leader of the opposition Democratic Party of Korea . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Moon Jae-in held Lee Jae-myung&#39;s hands tightly and persuaded him to &quot;stop the hunger strike&quot; and engage in the &quot;long-term battle&quot; (of the Common Democratic Party) with a new attitude. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Early the morning before, an ambulance took Li Zaiming to the hospital. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Lee was in extremely poor health tomorrow morning and was in a daze and had to make an emergency call.&quot; Park Sang-joon, spokesman for the Democratic Party of Korea, told South Korea&#39;s YTN radio station. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;September 18, 2023 was the 19th day of Li Zaiming&#39;s &quot;hunger strike&quot; to demonstrate against the Yin Xiyue government. On that day, the South Korean court once again filed an application for detention of Li Zaiming on the charge of &quot;dereliction of duty.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lee Jae-myung accused the Yoon Seok-yue regime of undermining order and democracy in South Korea, and went on a hunger strike on August 31. As of now, Li Zaiming is out of danger, but his body is still weak. He stated that he would only maintain infusion treatment and continue his hunger strike. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Lee Jae-myung&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;’s “indefinite hunger strike”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;“As one of the citizens, I start today to challenge the incompetent and violent regime. &#39;National&#39; resistance.&quot; On August 31, 2023, Lee Jae-myung announced an &quot;indefinite hunger strike&quot; at the press conference for the first anniversary of the Democratic Party of China. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Zaiming made three demands to the ruling party: Yin Xiyue apologized to the people for destroying people&#39;s livelihood; the ruling party should oppose Japan&#39;s discharge of nuclear-contaminated water into the sea; and reorganize the cabinet. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lee Jae-myung is Moon Jae-in’s “successor” within the party. Before entering politics, Li Zaiming was a human rights lawyer and participated in human rights and citizen movements many times. From 2010 to 2021, Lee Jae-myung served successively as the mayor of Seongnam and the governor of Gyeonggi Province. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In October 2021, Lee Jae-myung resigned as governor of Gyeonggi Province and participated in the South Korean presidential election. He narrowly lost to South Korean President Yoon Seok-yue and later became the leader of the Democratic Party of Korea. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the early days of the hunger strike, Li Zaiming set up a tent in front of the Capitol and conducted a sit-in protest. As Lee Jae-myung&#39;s health declined, he began to move into the party leader&#39;s office. Many senior figures from the Democratic Party of Korea and South Korean politicians came to persuade him to stop his hunger strike. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to Korean media reports, the ruling National Power Party &quot;took no measures&quot; in response to Lee Jae-myung&#39;s hunger strike. &lt;p>; /p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Central Daily News&quot; editorial criticized the ruling party&#39;s inappropriate stance on &quot;Lee Jae-myung&#39;s hunger strike.&quot; The National Power Party once ridiculed that &quot;a seafood tasting event will be held near Lee Jae-myung&#39;s hunger strike tent.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sit-ins, marches and hunger strikes are common practice in South Korea’s political arena, and both the ruling and opposition parties will express condolences to hunger strikers. In the 1980s, when former South Korean President Kim Young-sam went on a hunger strike, the secretary of the then ruling party went to express condolences and conveyed then President Chun Doo-hwan’s intention to urge an end to the hunger strike; in 1990, when former South Korean President Kim Dae-jung went on a hunger strike to demand the full implementation of local autonomy , Jin Yongsan also went to express condolences. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Facing pressure from public opinion, Kim Ki-hyun posted on social media on September 16, &quot;solemnly requesting Lee Jae-myung to stop his hunger strike&quot; and proposing to hold a meeting between the leaders of the ruling and opposition parties to discuss people&#39;s livelihood affairs after he &quot;recovers his health.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;“To avoid prosecution charges”? &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;South Korean prosecutors once believed that Lee Jae-myung&#39;s hunger strike was suspected of avoiding the prosecutor&#39;s investigation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“This is the first time I have gone on a hunger strike after being notified of being summoned by the prosecutor.” Korean Minister of Justice Han Dong-hoon complained that the continued operation of the judicial system cannot be suspended just because a suspect under investigation went on a hunger strike. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On September 4, South Korean prosecutors investigated Lee Jae-ming in connection with the &quot;Sangling Group Bribery Case.&quot; It is believed that when he was the governor of Gyeonggi Province from 2019 to 2020, he was suspected of soliciting a bribe of approximately 10.6 billion won from Kim Sung-tae, chairman of Sangryong Group, on the pretext of paying for a visit to North Korea. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, Li Zaiming is related to two cases. From 2014 to 2015, while serving as the mayor of Seongnam City, Lee Jae-myung was suspected of taking care of real estate developers based on his position, causing the Seongnam Urban Development Corporation to lose 20 billion won. In February 2019, Lee Jae-myung was suspected of violating the Public Office Election Act and instigating others to provide false testimony that was favorable to him during his trial. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the morning of September 18, when Li Zaiming was seeking medical treatment, South Korean prosecutors merged the two suspicions of the &quot;Sangling Group Bribery Case&quot; and the &quot;Real Estate Case&quot; and applied for an arrest warrant against Li Zaiming. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On September 19, Yin Xiyue, who was attending the United Nations General Assembly in New York, approved the arrest consent request sent by the prosecutor. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As a current member of Congress, Lee Jae-myung enjoys the privilege of not being arrested without the consent of Congress. To arrest a member of Congress, more than half of the members must be present and more than half of the members must agree. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to South Korea&#39;s &quot;Parliament Law&quot;, after receiving the consent for arrest, the Speaker of the National Assembly needs to convene a plenary meeting report on the matter and vote &quot;within 24 hours and 72 hours&quot; after the report. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;South Korean prosecutors are using clues to bite Li Zaiming, but the possibility of him being arrested this time is not high.&quot; Li Jiacheng, associate professor at the School of International Economics and Politics at Liaoning University, analyzed to Southern Weekend reporters, South Korea in February 2023 The prosecutor&#39;s request to arrest Lee Jae-myung for the real estate case was rejected by Congress. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Currently, South Korea has 297 current members of Congress, including 167 members from the Common Democratic Party, accounting for more than half of the opposition parties. This time, Li Zaiming&#39;s hunger strike received concern and condolences from important people within the party. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the &quot;Central Daily News&quot; report, on September 20, the South Korean Congress will hold a plenary meeting to discuss the &quot;Lee Jae-myung Arrest Consent Case&quot; and vote on September 21. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On September 21, the South Korean Congress will also vote on the &quot;Recommendation for the Removal of Prime Minister Han Deok-soo.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Due to Lee Jae-myung’s hunger strike, the Democratic Party of Korea submitted a proposal to dismiss Prime Minister Han Deok-soo on September 16, demanding the collective resignation of the ruling party’s cabinet. The move was seen as an attempt by the opposition parties to put pressure on the Yoon Seok-yue government. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;The controversy behind the discharge of nuclear-contaminated water into the sea&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;On the recent &quot;issue of Japan&#39;s discharge of nuclear-contaminated water into the sea&quot;, the Korean government and the opposition are quite divided. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the evening of August 23, before the hunger strike, Lee Jae-myung led more than a thousand people related to the Democratic Party of Korea to hold a candlelight rally. He accused &quot;the East China Sea is turning into the Sea of ​​Japan&quot; and urged the Yoon Seok-yue government to oppose the discharge of Japan&#39;s nuclear-contaminated water into the sea. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The National Power Party represented by Yin Xiyue supports &quot;discharging nuclear contaminated water into the sea&quot; and sends a signal to the international community that &quot;you will not die if you eat aquatic products.&quot; On August 29, the ruling party held a two-day and one-night &quot;eating broadcast&quot; to promote aquatic products. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Representative Lee (Jae-myeong) comes to a place like this and eats some (aquatic products)!&quot; Park Dae-chu, chairman of the policy committee of the National Power Party, joked. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Ordinary people in South Korea strongly oppose Japan&#39;s discharge of nuclear-contaminated water into the sea, and the progressive Democratic Party supports the ordinary people. The National Power Party, which is dominated by conservative forces, is pro-American and pro-Japanese in foreign policy. Yoon Seok-yue The government strongly supports Japan&#39;s discharge of nuclear-contaminated water.

It is an art composed of colorful grids and lines, and is a visual presentation of the balanced beauty of the universe. I have to think about: What is the connection between cities, landscapes, architecture, art, etc., and people? This is also a question that Yifu Tuan, the father of humanistic geography, has been thinking about throughout his life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When talking about Duan Yifu, people may mention his birthplace of Tianjin, his childhood place of residence in Chongqing, his relationship with Duan Qirui, talk about the countries and countless cities he has traveled to, and admire his work in Despite his brilliant academic achievements, he may still lament his long and lonely life. Such a life is complicated - both brilliant and dull, surrounded by others and often alone. He settled in an apartment in a metropolis, but rooted his soul in the desert and the universe...&lt;/p >; &lt;p>;Because of his rich, wise and simple inner world, Yifu Tuan is often called the &quot;little prince&quot; in the field of geography. His most well-known achievement is that in the 1960s and 1970s, when the positivism advocating instrumental rationality swept Western geography, he restored the humanistic spirit of geography in a simple, determined and wise way, and pioneered the study of geography. Humanistic geography, which had a far-reaching influence on later generations, became famous in the world academic circles. Although there have been many differences and tensions between the development of geography and Tuan Yifu&#39;s thoughts since the 1980s, and his own research and writing style is difficult to be inherited by later generations, his knowledge creation and wisdom enlightenment have always been beyond the reach of geography. An overlooked bright color. In other words, if Yifu Tuan had not been born in this world, the light of geography’s wisdom would be much dimmer than it is now. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many scholars have written articles about Yifu Tuan’s life and contribution to geography. In my eyes, one of Yifu Tuan&#39;s most outstanding contributions to geography is that he restored the aesthetics and emotion of geography, thus greatly expanding the scope of geography research and writing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before Yifu Tuan, many geographers had emphasized that the expression of aesthetics and emotion is an important channel for understanding the natural environment. This actually goes back to a common question asked by scientists during the Enlightenment: How do people understand nature? Alexander von Humboldt, who had a profound influence on Yifu Tuan, was one of the important figures. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/19/OFo8OX1dEBnqWuulC3E4n7CNjYjYnvhPftAYk0IV.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;928&quot; height= &quot;580&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/19/OFo8OX1dEBnqWuulC3E4n7CNjYjYnvhPftAYk0IV.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251241&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Alexander von Humboldt. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Humboldt devoted his life to inspiring &quot;love of nature&quot; and advocated that &quot;nature must also be experienced through human feelings&quot;, Because Humboldt himself was greatly influenced by Kant&#39;s transcendental rationalism. Kant emphasized that human reason legislates nature, which naturally shifts the relationship between human beings and the environment to the human side. As a result, Humboldt&#39;s thought first brewed the &quot;people-centered&quot; humanistic geography perspective. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, while Humboldt was in Jena, he lived with the poet Goethe day and night, and influenced each other, which made his study of nature constantly highlight human subjectivity. He shifted from his initial obsession with pure empirical analysis to Develop an understanding of nature, linking precise scientific evidence with emotional responses to landscapes. Furthermore, he also re-examined people&#39;s &quot;imagination&quot; and believed that imagination is as important as rational thinking and is also a necessary tool for understanding nature. These seeds of Humboldt&#39;s thoughts were sown in Tuan Yifu&#39;s thoughts. In many of Yifu Tuan&#39;s works, we can clearly feel the intertwining of reason and imagination, which constitutes an important channel for interpreting the meaning of the environment. For example, Yifu Tuan&#39;s work &quot;Place, Art and Self&quot; explores the bridge of meaning between environment, emotion and self. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If Humboldt inspired Yifu Tuan’s human-centered perspective, then the “semiotics” that attempts to connect people and things helped Yifu Tuan open up the emotional relationship between people and the environment. American philosopher Susan Lange is an important figure in semiotic aesthetics. Her &quot;Emotion and Form&quot; is a book often cited by Yi-fu Tuan. Her influence on Yifu Tuan is reflected in exploring the &quot;form&quot; relationship between human feelings and the environment. This relationship is known in geography as &quot;sense of place.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Susan Lange insists that the human senses are also capable of abstraction. As she puts it: &quot;Eye and ear must have their logic.&quot; Such logic is not a positivist inference of factual evidence. Logic, but the &quot;logic of representation&quot; when people experience environmental materials. For example, although waves have no direct relationship with life on the physical level, the image of never-ending waves is as continuous as life. This is what Susan Lange calls the similarity of representational logic, which is also the form of emotion, a symbol that connects people&#39;s feelings with the environment. Yifu Tuan uses metaphors in many works to describe such connections. For example, Yifu Tuan talked about how people would associate their bodies with the landscape, producing words like &quot;ridge&quot; and &quot;estuary&quot;. Although at the physical level, mountains have no backs and rivers have no mouths, there are similarities in apparent logic between them. Then, artificially creating these words expresses the formal isomorphic relationship between human feelings and natural objects. This kind of &quot;sense of place&quot; is exactly what Yifu Tuan is exploring. For example, the relationship between vision and color, body and architecture, imagination and mountains, etc. Furthermore, at the deepest level, the isomorphic relationship between &quot;identity&quot; and &quot;place&quot; can also be explored. Yifu Tuan summarizes all these relationships into one term - &quot;experience&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/19/YEJQETUdhzENESNAVxpx6BdxfD754p2EkWQeWzaZ.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1200&quot; height= &quot;848&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/19/YEJQETUdhzENESNAVxpx6BdxfD754p2EkWQeWzaZ.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251243&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Susan Lange&#39;s &quot;Emotion and Form&quot; is a book that Yifu Tuan often quotes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What are the attributes of &quot;experience&quot;? In the book &quot;Space and Place&quot;, he pointed out: Experience is like a spectrum, with one end leaning toward emotion and the other end toward thought, but the two blend with each other from beginning to end. Therefore, Yifu Tuan&#39;s definition of the connotation of experience has greatly expanded the scope of geographical epistemology: while recognizing the value of rational analysis (scientific), it also gives equal status to emotional description. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Therefore, Yifu Tuan’s geographical emotion is an emotion that can communicate with others, can form intersubjectivity, and has an objective logical form. In other words, this emotion starts from the individual and transcends the individual. It is a kind of intentionality with universal significance. It is precisely because of this that Yifu Tuan&#39;s geography can enter the public domain and generate extremely high academic value. Therefore, it is not as criticized by positivists that Tuan Yifu&#39;s geography is only individual and subjective. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In his academic career of more than sixty years, Yi-fu Tuan created a large number of geographical works rich in emotion and aesthetic form. For example, he successively explored the relationship between alienation and fragmentation between people and the environment (&quot;The Broken World and the Self&quot; in 1982), the coexistence of pampering and manipulation (&quot;Making Pets&quot; in 1984), and the relationship between localism and cosmopolitanism (1996 &quot;The Universe and the Hearth&quot; (1998)), and the relationship of escape (&quot;Escapism&quot; (1998)), etc. These works have greatly enriched the research content of geography. According to Tim Criswell, a former protégé of Yi-Fu Tuan and now a professor of geography at the University of Edinburgh, “When Yi-Fu Tuan was studying the desert landscapes of the American Southwest, few geographers cared about how the landscape reflected human life. Values, and no one will pay attention to people&#39;s emotions of pampering and controlling the environment, and no one will think that the most ordinary things in life, such as houses, gutters and scissors, have beauty.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time , in order to explore these relationships, Duan Yifu not only wandered through various fragments of literature, ethnography, psychology, and ancient urban history, but also used poetic language to skillfully weave the themes he wanted to express. , the scope of geography writing has been greatly expanded, providing rich nutrients for the development of humanistic geography in later generations. Therefore, Tim Criswell said: Yifu Tuan’s influence has transcended the glorious 1970s of humanistic geography. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, Yifu Tuan’s geographical aesthetic appreciation is not entirely an objectified aesthetic appreciation. He even incorporated his own life experience into it. As Duan Yifu wrote in his autobiography &quot;Who Am I?&quot; &quot;&quot; said that geography helped him overcome the loss of life and find the meaning of life. It was geography that saved him. Therefore, Tuan Yifu&#39;s geography is often a kind of writing that &quot;uses itself as a method&quot;. In other words, he analyzed his life as a practical sample for the world to observe, allowing others to see his own joys, anger, sorrows, life and death, and then formed a kind of environmental aesthetics and emotional expression in which the author&#39;s &quot;subject appears&quot;, which is profound. The intensity and appeal far exceed the object-oriented aesthetic method of simply standing opposite the scenery and maintaining a certain distance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2022, 92-year-old Yifu Tuan published a booklet titled &quot;Geography from 1947 to 2022: A Travel Record&quot;. He said:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What exactly is my contribution to human geography? That is, I enriched the meaning of the word &quot;person&quot;. In the past, geographers in the field of natural science were people who had the courage to explore inaccessible places. When I was an undergraduate, the geography professors at Oxford and Cambridge were all such explorers. …They have little to no interest in people. When geographers talk about people, they just treat them as another natural force that changes the landscape of the earth. Since the 1930s, talents have been given other attributes. First, under the influence of Karl Saul, people were given cultural attributes; then in the 1960s, under the influence of David Lowenthal and Robert Gates, people were given psychological attributes; and finally in the 1970s, people were given psychological attributes. In the era, people are endowed with aesthetic attributes. But what baffles me is why such an obviously human attribute has been ignored for so long. The fact that it was ignored was due to the prevailing paradigm at the time. Therefore, I urge you once again, young traveler! Be sure to have the courage to steer your ship like a captain, albeit with only life&#39;s confusing clues and stars as your guides. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is Yifu Tuan’s contribution to geography. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 20 Sep 2023 16:26:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[三年4任董事长，“药中茅台”为何震荡不断？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257180]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-20 15:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/20/rCNgV1xm9msQKl2HYkAS2vgrqM209hWEGqk8Z4kU.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/rCNgV1xm9msQKl2HYkAS2vgrqM209 hWEGqk8Z4kU. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251259&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Many time-honored traditional Chinese medicine companies face the same anti-corruption problem. (Pien Tze Huang, composed of bezoars, musk, notoginseng, and snake gall, is used to clear away heat. Detoxify, cool blood and remove blood stasis, reduce swelling and relieve pain. This small pill is said to have been introduced from the Ming Dynasty. The company that manufactured it was founded in 1956 and has been on the market for 20 years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Pien Tze Huang has reached a turning point again.” Li Bin, a long-term holder of Pien Tze Huang shares, private equity fund manager Li Bin, told Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On September 6, 2023, Lin Zhihui, the new chairman of Pien Tze Huang (600436.SH), with a total market value of more than 164 billion and known as the &quot;Moutai of Medicine&quot; by the market, attended the 6th &quot;Belt and Road Initiative&quot; Traditional Chinese Medicine Development Forum. Investors believe this is his first appearance since becoming the new chairman in early August. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is Pien Tze Huang’s fourth coaching change since 2021. The previous two chairman of the board were investigated by the Discipline Inspection Commission for suspected serious violations of disciplines and laws. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the end of August, the Commission for Discipline Inspection and Supervision of Zhangzhou City, Fujian Province released information that Liu Jianshun, who had served as chairman of Pien Tze Huang for seven years, was expelled from the party for violating laws and disciplines. He will retire in 2021. Pan Jie, who succeeded him, was also subject to disciplinary review and supervisory investigation by the Zhangzhou Municipal Commission for Discipline Inspection and Supervision in May for suspected serious violations of discipline and law. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to incomplete statistics from Southern Weekend reporters, five executives of Pien Tze Huang and its subsidiaries have been investigated in 2023. From June 2022 to the present, Pien Tze Huang’s board secretary, chief engineer, chief auditor, etc. Many senior executives have resigned. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the view of Lu Dingliang, a lawyer at Jingshi Law Firm, the products of traditional Chinese medicine companies such as Pien Tze Huang leave room for power rent-seeking due to their certain resource nature and scarcity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“The number of Pien Tze Huang executives who have been investigated is relatively prominent, which is closely related to the company’s stock price, product selling price and scarcity.” He analyzed to Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Chairman of &quot;Liu Shui&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Zhangzhou Pien Tze Huang Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. was founded in 1999 by the restructuring of Zhangzhou Pharmaceutical Factory, which was established in 1956. , currently has 13 directly held subsidiaries and 9 joint-stock companies. Its controlling shareholder is a state-owned enterprise in Zhangzhou City. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the end of August, the Zhangzhou Commission for Discipline Inspection and Supervision released information that former chairman Liu Jianshun was expelled from the party for serious violations of discipline and law. It mentioned that he &quot;received gifts and large amounts of money in violation of regulations; relied on enterprises to support enterprises, and took advantage of his position to provide Others seek benefits and accept huge amounts of property from others.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu Jianshun is 60 years old and served as chairman of Pien Tze Huang from 2014 to 2021. During this period, Pien Tze Huang’s revenue increased from 1.4 billion yuan to 6.5 billion yuan, and the stock price rose from 21 yuan/share to 4 in 2021. The monthly highest price is around 350 yuan/share. Three months after he left office, Pien Tze Huang experienced a period of intense speculation, with its stock price rising to a new high of 480 yuan per share, and Pien Tze Huang tablets on the market selling for thousands of yuan per pill. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In April 2021, Liu Jianshun retired early due to &quot;personal physical reasons&quot; and resigned from relevant positions. Pan Jie, who had served as general manager of Pien Tze Huang and other positions, took over as chairman. But within eight months, Pan Jie resigned from the relevant position on the grounds of &quot;work adjustment.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the &quot;&lt;span>;&lt;a href=&quot;http://static.sse.com.cn/disclosure/listedinfo/announcement/c/new/2022-04-16/600436_20220416_6_1FsQWSqY. pdf&quot;>;Zhangzhou Pien Tze Huang Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. 2021 Social Responsibility Report and ESG (Environmental, Social and Corporate Governance) Report&lt;/a>;&lt;/span>;&quot; mentioned that in 2021, Pien Tze Huang established the &quot;Zhangzhou Municipal Supervisory Committee in Office of the Ombudsman of Zhangzhou Pien Tze Huang Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In July of the same year, according to information on Pien Tze Huang’s official website, the Discipline Inspection and Supervision Offices of three Pien Tze Huang-owned enterprises, including Cosmetics Co., Ltd., were established, achieving full coverage of supervision of all public officials exercising public power in the company. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In December 2021, Lin Weiqi, a member of the Party Committee and Deputy Director of the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of Zhangzhou City, Fujian Province, became the new chairman of Pien Tze Huang. During his tenure from June to July 2022, the then secretary of the board of directors, deputy general manager, supervisor, chief engineer, and chief auditor resigned one after another. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Less than 17 months after taking office, in July 2023, Lin Weiqi resigned from the company due to &quot;work adjustment&quot;. A month later, Lin Zhihui became Pien Tze Huang&#39;s new chairman. According to the announcement issued by Pien Tze Huang, Lin Zhihui has served as a member of the Standing Committee of the Zhangzhou Municipal Commission for Discipline Inspection and a member of the Zhangzhou Municipal Supervisory Committee. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Taking stock of official notifications over the past year: In May, former chairman Pan Jie was subject to disciplinary review and supervisory investigation by the Zhangzhou Municipal Commission for Discipline Inspection and Supervision on suspicion of serious violations of discipline and law; in June, the former deputy director of Pien Tze Huang Cosmetics Co., Ltd. Chairman Yang Puquan was put on file for review and investigation for serious violations of disciplines and laws; in August, former chairman Lin Jinsheng of Pien Tze Huang Cosmetics Co., Ltd. was expelled from the party and public office for serious violations of disciplines and laws; at the end of August, former chairman Liu Jianshun was expelled from the party for serious violations of disciplines and laws. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In these intensive notifications, words such as &quot;relying on enterprises to eat enterprises&quot; and &quot;seeking personal gain&quot; were mentioned. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;More corruption problems occur in dealers&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;How much impact does frequent coaching changes have on the company? Pien Tze Huang&#39;s stock price has dropped from the highest of 482.33 yuan per share at the end of 2021 to the current price of 271.98 yuan per share, a drop of 43%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Bin believes that Pien Tze Huang has a very mature brand, system and customer base, so the role of management is relatively downplayed, and the replacement of senior executives will have little impact on the company. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From the financial report, from 2020 to 2022, Pien Tze Huang’s revenue increased from 6.511 billion yuan to 8.694 billion yuan, and its net profit increased from 1.672 billion yuan to 2.472 billion yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Bin said, &quot;Generally speaking, Pien Tze Huang&#39;s main sales channels are not in hospitals, but in pharmacies and the Internet.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the financial report, in 2021, Pien Tze Huang&#39;s operating income was 8.022 billion yuan, and sales expenses were 650 million yuan. In 2022, operating income was 8.694 billion yuan, and sales expenses were 483 million yuan. Selling expenses account for 8.1%-5.55% of revenue. In comparison, the IPO report of Hanwang Pharmaceutical, a traditional Chinese medicine pharmaceutical company, showed that sales expenses accounted for more than 80% of its main business revenue. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lu Dingliang believes that traditional Chinese medicine is different from Western medicine and equipment. “The public relations focus of medical equipment and Western medicine is to have a good relationship with doctors and hospitals. But the corruption of traditional Chinese medicine in the C-end market is more about distribution. Corruption issues have arisen in the business chain.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the financial report, Pien Tze Huang’s domestic sales model is mainly OTC, that is, over-the-counter drugs. The main sales channel for prescription drugs is hospitals, and for over-the-counter drugs is pharmacies. Pien Tze Huang&#39;s sales channels include Pien Tze Huang experience centers, retail pharmacies and regional distributors. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Pien Tze Huang Experience Center&quot; appeared for the first time in the 2015 financial report. There were more than 20 experience centers that year. By the end of 2020, there were more than 300 “Pien Tze Huang Experience Centers” operating across the country. According to a report by China International Finance Securities in August 2023, there are nearly 400 Pien Tze Huang experience centers across the country, covering more than 100,000 terminal stores. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhang Liang became the person in charge of a Pien Tze Huang experience center in 2019. In his view, the changes in Pien Tze Huang’s management will not have a big impact on the experience center he runs. In comparison, the impact of price increases is more direct. &quot;The market is indeed relatively weak now, and the experience center itself does not want to increase prices. After the price increase, sales will decline,&quot; he told a reporter from Southern Weekend. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although it is still growing, Pien Tze Huang&#39;s revenue growth rate in 2022 is the lowest in five years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In May 2023, Pien Tze Huang stated that due to reasons such as the increase in main raw materials and labor costs, it would increase the domestic market retail price of its main product Pien Tze Huang tablets from 590 yuan/tablet to 760 yuan/tablet, and the supply price would be increased accordingly. About 170 yuan per pill, the largest price increase in history. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to Pien Tze Huang&#39;s 2003 prospectus, in 2000, the average domestic sales price of Pien Tze Huang was 93.2 yuan per pill. In twenty years, the price increase has been as high as 715%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When the ex-factory price is 390 yuan/tablet, the market retail price of Pien Tze Huang tablets is 590 yuan/tablet. How much is the difference between the current ex-factory price and retail price of Pien Tze Huang tablets? Zhang Liang said, &quot;The ex-factory price is confidential, but our price difference is not high and cannot be compared with Moutai.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A long-term investor in Pien Tze Huang told a Southern Weekend reporter, &quot;This price adjustment (to 760 yuan), as far as I know, the ex-factory price should be 560 yuan.&quot; That is, the difference between the ex-factory price and the retail price is 200 yuan/pill, the same as before. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A person in charge of the Pien Tze Huang Experience Center who is familiar with Li Bin also believes that after the price increase, there will be a certain impact on sales within half a year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Generally, sales will gradually return to normal after half a year. This year&#39;s price increase directly increases the ex-factory price and retail price by the same amount. In other words, the profit from the price increase belongs to Pien Tze Huang Company, and the profit It will be reflected in the performance, and the dealers will not make more money,&quot; Li Bin said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the 2023 semi-annual report, the gross profit margin of Pien Tze Huang pharmaceutical manufacturing industry was 74.2%. In the 2022 annual report, this figure was 78.7%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A person in charge of a traditional Chinese medicine company told a Southern Weekend reporter, &quot;The high profits of traditional Chinese medicine companies do not mean high profits for dealers. Products that can be sold at the C-end will not have much price difference.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;“ &lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Depend on the success of the enterprise &lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;” &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;A senior person in the pharmaceutical industry told Southern Weekend Reporter, in terms of drug research and development, Pien Tze Huang is a national secret formula with mysterious origin and high price. It seems to be widely used, but the price/performance ratio is unclear, but the sales volume is very impressive. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the official website of the State Drug Administration, the protection level of Pien Tze Huang is level 1, which is the highest level. Among the national traditional Chinese medicine varieties, only Pien Tze Huang and Yunnan Baiyao are national top-secret formulas. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Pien Tze Huang is now known as &quot;Moutai of Medicine&quot;, and the last one to be so called was Dong&#39;e Ejiao. From 2001 to the end of 2018, the price of Dong&#39;e Ejiao has been raised 18 times, an increase of 37 times. The reason for the price increase is &quot;the shortage of donkey skin resources.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The person in charge of the above-mentioned traditional Chinese medicine company also used Dong&#39;e E-jiao as an example. The profits of Dong&#39;e E-jiao dealers are also very thin. If the dealers stock up, the company will give a slight discount. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;The gameplay is to stock up downstream + increase prices. Frequent price increases are also because listed companies want to increase profits. I find Pien Tze Huang (price increases) a bit confusing, but only this type of company can have excess profits &quot;, he told Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since 2018, Dong&#39;e Ejiao&#39;s growth has stagnated, and in 2019 it suffered its first loss in 23 years since its listing. From 2017 to 2019, the company&#39;s book inventory exceeded 3 billion yuan. It began cutting prices and selling stakes in its subsidiaries. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In February 2023, Dong&#39;e Ejiao (000423.SZ) issued continuous personnel change announcements. The then chairman and vice president both resigned due to &quot;job changes.&quot; This is the third chairman the company has replaced since November 2019. Similar to Pien Tze Huang, three chairmen resigned in three years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In January 2020, nine senior executives including Qin Yufeng, the president of Dong&#39;e Ejiao, the assistant president, and the vice president resigned one after another. Two years later, Qin Yufeng was suspected of serious violations of discipline and law and is currently undergoing disciplinary review and supervisory investigation by the Discipline Inspection Commission of China Resources Pharmaceutical Holdings Co., Ltd. and the Supervisory Committee of Liaocheng City, Shandong Province. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Similar to them, there is Tongrentang. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the end of 2021, when Pien Tze Huang was on the rise, Tongrentang (600085.SH) raised the terminal retail price of Angong Niuhuang Pills from 780 yuan to 860 yuan, saying it was due to the rise in raw materials for traditional Chinese medicine. Since then, many Prices of varieties have been raised one after another. Angong Niuhuang Pills is the core product of Tongrentang. In 2022, Tongrentang&#39;s revenue was 15.4 billion yuan, and the top five products, including Angong Niuhuang Pills, achieved revenue of 4.5 billion yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In October 2021, relevant reports published on the website of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection and the State Supervisory Commission mentioned that Gao Zhenkun, the former general manager of Beijing Tongrentang, made more than 15 million yuan in profits from the purchase of raw materials for Angong Niuhuang Pills. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The article mentioned that when making Rentang’s signature patent medicines such as Angong Niuhuang Pills, Dahuoluo Pills, and Niuhuang Qingxin Pills, leopard bone, musk, antelope horn, bezoar and other ingredients are indispensable, and these are in high demand. , endangered fine materials with high profits, Gao Zhenkun saw huge space for rent-seeking power. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During his tenure at Tongrentang Group Secondary Enterprise Co., Ltd., Gao Zhenkun firmly held the power to purchase fine materials and used his supply and information advantages to make private profits of more than 15 million yuan. In order to maintain the relationship with Gao Zhenkun, many suppliers competed to provide food and clothing for him. Gao Zhenkun could get the key to a two-bedroom rental house by casually saying, &quot;The children go to school far away.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Relevant information about Wang Qingquan, the deputy general manager and operating branch manager of Tong Ren Tang, who accepted bribes published on the Judgment Documents website, mentioned that he took advantage of his position to repeatedly offer bribes to relevant parties at internal prices that were significantly lower than those stipulated by the group. Buy Angong Niuhuang Pills. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the currently released information on the investigation of relevant executives of Pien Tze Huang, &quot;depending on the enterprise to eat the enterprise&quot; has been mentioned many times. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Lu Dingliang’s view, traditional Chinese medicine products are fields with many intermediate links, large profit margins, high professional and technical barriers, and insufficient procurement transparency. These characteristics provide room for corruption. At the same time, the method of transferring benefits in this field is relatively hidden, making it difficult to discover corrupt behaviors, obtain clues, and form evidence chains. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“For traditional Chinese medicine, which faces the C-end market, the products are scarce and irreplaceable to a certain extent. If dealers obtain the right to sell, the profit margin will be relatively large, and they will provide a It’s possible,” he told Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2021, Pien Tze Huang’s stock price once rose to 483.69 yuan/share. As of press time, it was reported at 269.81 yuan/share, a drop of more than 40%. But for Li Bin, a long-term holder of Pien Tze Huang, he is more optimistic about Pien Tze Huang&#39;s performance in half a year since the price increase in May. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(At the request of the interviewee, Zhang Liang’s pseudonym is used in this article.)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 20 Sep 2023 15:25:03 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
