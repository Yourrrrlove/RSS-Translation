It shows 23 Chinese graduates who studied architecture at the University of Pennsylvania between 1918 and 1941. After returning to China, these students became pioneers in opening up China&#39;s construction industry and architectural education, and devoted themselves to building China&#39;s rapidly developing cities and towns. , so he is known as the &quot;first generation of Chinese modern architects&quot;. At the center of the panel is Lin Huiyin, the only female among these students, and the only one who was not awarded a degree in architecture from Penn. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the chief curator of the exhibition, Professor Lin Zhongjie from the Department of Urban and Regional Planning at the Weitzman School of Design at the University of Pennsylvania, Lin Huiyin and Liang Sicheng entered the University of Pennsylvania in the fall of 1924. At that time, they both wanted to pursue a degree in architecture. However, at that time, due to the fact that the required art courses including male model sketching and construction courses teaching construction techniques were not suitable for girls, the Department of Architecture at the University of Pennsylvania did not recruit girls, so Lin Huiyin had to register in the Art Department. However, she not only took all the architectural design courses, studied design theory, painting and architectural history, but also served as a teaching assistant in architectural design. Her academic performance was better than that of most of her male classmates. On her transcript, many classes received &quot;Excellence&quot; ( Distinguished) rating. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After returning to China, Lin Huiyin and Liang Sicheng worked together and made great contributions to reshaping China&#39;s architectural history, education and practice. “When you come to the United States, everyone knows Frank Lloyd Wright. And when you go to China, everyone knows Lin Huiyin and Liang Sicheng.” Weizman School of Design City and Region said Genie Birch, professor of urban studies and education in the Department of Planning. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1934, the University of Pennsylvania’s architecture major began to admit female students. Since then, the School of Fine Arts (the original name of the Weitzman School of Design in the 20th century) has awarded supplementary architecture degrees to women who had previously studied architecture at Penn, including Georgiana Pope, the first female director of the Philadelphia Department of City Building. Georgiana Pope Yeatman. But Lin Huiyin&#39;s case has been ignored, even though she completed more architecture courses than any other female student of her time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Judging from records at the time, it is clear that Lin Huiyin wanted to study architecture and become an architect, and she later achieved great success in this field.&quot; Dean of the Weizman School of Design Fritz Steiner, Paley Chair Professor, initiated an investigation and review process into Lin Huiyin’s degree starting in 2022. “As our research continues to deepen, it becomes clear why she was not awarded a degree. Her identity as a woman. This is a historical mistake and it’s time to correct it.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/17/6297d1bb86516148ed8689a960d73cfd.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;602&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/ 23/10/17/6297d1bb86516148ed8689a960d73cfd.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;254307&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After learning that the University of Pennsylvania decided to posthumously award Lin Huiyin a degree, her family expressed their pride, gratitude and joy. Feeling. &quot;For my mother to be recognized by the school a hundred years later, it reminds me of her bravery and determination in choosing this major. She identified architecture as a teenager and determined to become a new generation of female architects. She enthusiastically guided and encouraged her father Liang Sicheng fell in love with her and chose architecture together. From then on, she was loyal to her choice throughout her life and sacrificed everything for her choice.&quot; Lin Huiyin&#39;s daughter Liang Zaibing said with emotion that today, on Lin Huiyin&#39;s tombstone, her husband Liang Sicheng inscribed &quot;Architect Lin Huiyin&quot; can be said to be a high-level summary of her life. &quot;As her descendants, we admire and appreciate her fearless spirit in pursuing her artistic dreams.&quot; Lin Huiyin&#39;s granddaughter Yu Kui said that the University of Pennsylvania chose to honor Lin Huiyin on the occasion of the 120th anniversary of her birth and the 100th anniversary of her enrollment. Teaching a degree in architecture will inject more hope and strength into the pursuit of dreams for future generations, especially women. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 17 Oct 2023 23:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[既嫌弃又上头，霸总式微短剧正成为00后的电子榨菜？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257206]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-17 22:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&quot;The President&#39;s Billionaire Imprisoned Wife&quot;, &quot;The Heaven-defying Princess Leaves Too Wild&quot;, &quot;Son-in-law Dominates the World&quot; and &quot;Security &quot;The President&#39;s Daughter and Little Beloved Wife&quot;... If you come across micro-short dramas like this on short video platforms or other social platforms, don&#39;t be surprised. These micro-short dramas are becoming a creative craze, with people complaining about tyrants. Young people who always follow the same old tricks quietly hide in bed at night and start practicing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Detawen&#39;s Micro Short Drama Market Report for the First Half of 2023&quot; shows that a total of 481 new micro short dramas were released in the first half of 2023, compared with only 454 new ones in the whole year of 2022. This year The number of micro-short dramas in the first half of the year has exceeded that of the whole of last year. In July alone, 361 online micro-short dramas were recorded and announced. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the one hand, micro-short dramas are becoming a creative trend, on the other hand, the roughness and vulgarity of micro-short dramas are also despised by many netizens - why are micro-short dramas so popular? Is the only way for micro-short dramas to break out of the circle is the &quot;three vulgarities&quot;? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/13/gKB1xSTLiZ9trVAlnaHNSx5FO0tI7vY3tA5mLdg7.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;947&quot; height= &quot;627&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/13/gKB1xSTLiZ9trVAlnaHNSx5FO0tI7vY3tA5mLdg7.png&quot; data-key=&quot;253986&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（IC photo/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; >;&lt;strong>;Short, flat, fast&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Compared with previous long dramas or short dramas, the difference between micro-short dramas is the length. Each episode can be up to ten minutes, and the shortest can even be only A few dozen seconds is in sharp contrast to the average length of a long drama episode of 40 minutes. In the past two years, the creation of micro-short dramas has become a trend, mainly due to the &quot;short, flat, and fast&quot; nature of its creation form. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;Short&quot; means that the duration of micro-short dramas is very short, the shooting threshold is very low, and the shooting techniques are much simpler. It can be said that as long as you have a mobile phone and a story outline, you can shoot a short drama. A short drama. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Assuming 20 episodes, each episode is 1 minute, a short drama is only 20 minutes long, which is less than the length of one episode of a long drama. With such a low threshold for creation, everyone can enter. Various small film and television production companies have used micro-short plays as the starting point for creation, easily triggering a creative boom. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Plain&quot;, micro-short dramas are generally not so particular in film and television arts, and can be plain and mediocre. This is because micro-short dramas are parasitic on short video platforms. They are not meant to be viewed on large screens such as TVs, and mobile phone screens have limited capacity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Especially for micro-short plays with a vertical screen, if you take a close-up shot and see the expressions of the characters clearly, you can probably only accommodate two characters, so it is difficult to pay attention to the depth of field, Space layout and shot scheduling. Therefore, many micro-short dramas are just about filming the characters and the plot, and they are all about saving money on the art and scenery, the service, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Fast&quot; means that the filming time of micro-short dramas is very fast, the broadcast cycle is very fast, and more importantly, the money comes in very quickly. The cost of many micro-short dramas is only a few thousand or tens of thousands of yuan. You can shoot one in three to five days. After filming one, you can directly launch a short video or small program. If it becomes popular, you can copy another one in ten days. It&#39;s a good money, you can quickly get a lot of traffic. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are many ways to make money from micro-short dramas. Although micro-short dramas with an episode length of one or two minutes are not available on long-form video platforms such as &quot;Youai Tengmang&quot;, they are very popular on short-video platforms. After micro-short dramas become popular, the protagonists of micro-short dramas can transform into Internet celebrities and carry out live broadcasts to promote products; some micro-short dramas are customized by advertisers, and the entire episode revolves around the advertising brand. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Those micro-short dramas that are parasitic on small programs can also be watched on a paid basis. A drama usually has more than 100 episodes, and each episode is one minute. The first part can be watched for free, but the subsequent episodes require payment. Unlocked viewing, watching a mini-series is even more expensive than watching a movie. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The creative threshold is very low, the creative techniques are simple, the shooting time is short, and the money comes in quickly... It is not surprising that micro-short dramas have become a new trend. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/13/KEwiaPCVhglej8e5wja668usJKahucGEiupeCjE4.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/13/KEwiaPCVhglej8e5wja668usJKahucGEiupeCjE4.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;253984&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（IC photo/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; >;&lt;strong>;Vulgar, vulgar, kitsch&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;However, it is worth noting that on the one hand, micro-short dramas are very popular, and on the other hand, micro-short dramas have been criticized and criticized by many people. The root cause is that a large part of micro-short dramas on the market have strong &quot;three vulgarities&quot; characteristics: vulgarity, vulgarity, and kitsch. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Swarmed are all micro-short dramas. There are too many content for the audience to choose from. If you don’t find it interesting, just flick it by in three or two seconds, and the micro-short dramas will not get traffic. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to catch the attention of users at the first glance, the orientation of many micro-short dramas can only be very &quot;vulgar&quot;. As some netizens summarized, they are nothing more than &quot;The Domineering President Falls in Love with Me, The Hero&quot; Saving an American but being rescued, falling in love while playing hard to get, seeing the true love in a kidnapping case&quot;... It&#39;s just a &quot;picking up&quot;, &quot;picking up a boss as a girlfriend&quot;, &quot;picking up a boss as a boyfriend&quot;, &quot;picking up a boss as a husband&quot;, &quot;accidentally picking up a boss&quot; Contents such as “Get a CEO Husband” are flying all over the place. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some micro-short dramas have further slipped into &quot;vulgarity&quot; and made a big fuss over the edges. In particular, some micro-short dramas in mini programs have not obtained online registration numbers. The content is very large, full of sexual innuendo, or has bloody and violent scenes. Moreover, because the broadcast channel is very hidden, it has repeatedly escaped supervision, which is quite bad. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Whether it is vulgar or vulgar, it is all about pleasing and flattering the audience. It not only caters to the instinctive parts of human nature, but also tries its best to tease users&#39; emotions and create traffic by selling emotions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This emotion is composed of &quot;hate&quot; and &quot;pleasure&quot; - many micro-short dramas remind us of Mi Meng in the public account era - interestingly, after the transformation, Mi Meng has also become a micro-short drama The manipulator behind the show: The targets of the micro-short drama are &quot;bitches, low bitches, scumbags, scumbags, and vicious female supporting characters.&quot; These &quot;enemies&quot; combine all kinds of personality flaws that the audience is tired of. The method maximizes the various flaws of the &quot;enemy&quot; to arouse the audience&#39;s hatred, and then humiliates, criticizes and attacks these villains through the protagonist&#39;s counterattack, allowing the audience to gain a sense of emotional catharsis. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the &quot;hate&quot; and &quot;happiness&quot; brought about by this kind of kitsch simplify human nature, breed intolerance between people, intensify estrangement, and have a subtle influence on social mentality. negative impact. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/13/HZf8qSQLY6dllV6303J3HB0mSaiUAleQfqMVMN0W.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/13/HZf8qSQLY6dllV6303J3HB0mSaiUAleQfqMVMN0W.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;253985&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（IC photo/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; >;&lt;strong>;The possibility of being &quot;micro&quot; but not &quot;vulgar&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The recklessness of micro-short dramas has attracted official attention. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Especially in May this year, the State Administration of Radio, Film and Television issued new rules for the broadcasting of online dramas. After June 1, 2023, online dramas, online mini-series, online movies, and online cartoons that have been planned and registered will be Adopt a management approach with full license coverage. Only broadcasts can be broadcast after obtaining the &quot;Online Drama Distribution License&quot; in accordance with the law. Those without a license are not allowed to be broadcast; for those that have previously passed the planning and filing, licenses or numbers will be issued based on the circumstances. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Furthermore, starting from June 1, 2023, newly launched online dramas, online micro-shorts, online movies, and online cartoons must be declared through the &quot;Key Online Film and Television Drama Information Filing System&quot; , and works that have obtained the &quot;Online Drama Distribution License&quot; or online registration number after passing the content review of the radio and television management department at or above the provincial level. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before this, there was a brief regulatory blank period for micro-short dramas. That is, many micro-short dramas were filmed and released casually. Take whatever you can to catch people&#39;s attention. Some short dramas on mini programs have become a place for &quot;harboring evil and evil people and practices&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the new regulations are released, the creation and broadcast of micro-short dramas will also face strict review. Only those that pass the review can be broadcast online on the platform. This also means that it is difficult to follow the &quot;three customs&quot; path of micro-short dramas. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Micro short plays can only be &quot;micro&quot; but not &quot;vulgar&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the one hand, micro-short dramas can also be &quot;high-quality&quot;. For example, &quot;Youai Tengmang&quot; is also entering the micro-short drama industry. Each episode of the micro-short dramas they produce is only ten minutes long, and they use regular techniques for filming film and television dramas to shoot micro-short dramas. This makes micro-short dramas have A certain aesthetic style makes it more meaningful. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, in this year&#39;s popular &quot;Invitation&quot;, director Zeng Qingjie&#39;s camera language is very sophisticated, and he shoots a story in a pure and beautiful way. It has the simplicity of a short play and the texture of a long drama. The box office is divided into two. More than 16 million yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the other hand, for those micro-short dramas with a single episode of only tens of seconds or two or three minutes, the production team does not have the money to pay attention to quality, so they have to make a fuss about the theme expression. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since it cannot be &quot;vulgar&quot;, it is necessary to find another way, either to maximize the &quot;refreshing feeling&quot;, or to refresh the audience through creativity. Otherwise, the micro-short drama will either end up being filmed but not broadcast, or it will be passed over by the audience after it is broadcast. Even if the cost is not high, it will end up in the street. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 17 Oct 2023 22:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[恶狗撕咬幼童引发强烈关注，防止烈犬伤人重在防患未然丨快评]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258775]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-17 20:56:46&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Recently, a video of a vicious dog biting a child went viral on social networks, and netizens strongly demanded that the vicious dog be severely punished. Owner. According to the latest report from the joint investigation working group of Chongzhou City (a county-level city under the jurisdiction of Chengdu City): At about 3:00 on October 17, Tang Mou, the owner of the black Rottweiler, arrived at the case. At present, the police have opened a case for investigation into the incident and have taken criminal coercive measures against Tang, the owner of the black Rottweiler dog, in accordance with the law. The case is under further investigation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The video posted online showed a big black dog wandering in the open space in front of the building. As soon as a child and his parents walked out of the corridor, the black dog stepped forward and bit the child. The parents quickly protected the child. , but the big dog threw them both to the ground and continued to bite. It wasn&#39;t until the neighbor brought a mop and stick that the big dog was driven away. On October 16, the Chongzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau reported that in the morning, when Deng and her daughter Tang were walking downstairs in the community, a black dog attacked Tang and bit her. Tang suffered multiple bites all over his body, contusion and laceration on his right kidney, and fractured ribs on his right side. After all-out treatment, the wound debridement surgery was completed and his vital signs were stable. Deng suffered abrasions on his body. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The police have taken criminal coercive measures against the owners of vicious dogs, but this wounding incident has once again reminded us that illegal dog-raising must be severely cracked down on, and we must take precautions before it happens. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, there have been many similar incidents of vicious dogs hurting people recently. In April 2021, a second-grade student in Chongqing was bitten to death by a neighbor&#39;s dog on his way to school, and a pit bull bitten four adults in Huangshi, Hubei; in December 2020, a 3-year-old child was bitten to death by a dog in Hebi, Henan. ; In November, a mother and daughter were bitten by their own dogs in Dujiangyan, Sichuan. The mother died and the daughter was injured...&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some of the dogs that killed and injured people were stray dogs, and many had owners. Raised. Is it because similar incidents occur frequently because there are no regulations regulating dog breeding? No. From the national level, the Animal Epidemic Prevention Law, which will take effect on May 1, 2021, has a special provision for dog breeding, requiring dogs to be vaccinated regularly and to wear dog tags and leashes when taking dogs out of the house. Major cities have already enacted local regulations regulating dog keeping. The Standing Committee of the Chengdu Municipal People&#39;s Congress formulated regulations on the management of dog breeding in 2009, which stipulates that individuals are prohibited from raising aggressive dogs and large dogs. In restricted areas, dogs must be registered with the public security organs and apply for certificates. When taking dogs out of the house, dogs must be put into dog cages and dogs. The dog must be held in a bag or led by a person with full capacity for civil conduct using a dog leash to promptly stop the dog from barking and attacking pedestrians. In 2018, Chengdu police also carried out the work of collecting and disposing of prohibited dogs in restricted areas. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the 2018 police interpretation, the restricted breeding areas in Chengdu include Wuhou District, Chenghua District, Jinniu District, Jinjiang District, Qingyang District and High-tech Zone, as well as restricted breeding areas designated by other districts, cities and counties. It is not clear whether Yangma Street in Chongzhou City, where the vicious dog wounding incident occurred, is a restricted area. Rottweilers that bite people are not among the dog breeds banned in Chengdu’s restricted areas. However, even if it is not illegal to raise a Rottweiler, if the owner allows the dog to roam freely in the public area downstairs, without a leash, without a lead, and fails to stop the dog from attacking others in a timely manner, he must bear corresponding consequences for these actions. legal liability. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The first is civil liability for compensation. The dog owner must bear the medical expenses of the bitten girl and the injured parents, and must also compensate the victim for her mental losses. Being bitten by a vicious dog not only causes serious physical injuries, but also causes huge psychological trauma to young children, and they should receive corresponding compensation. It should be pointed out that China’s mental damage compensation standards have always been on the low side. For example, in the case of a primary school student in Chongqing who was bitten to death, the dog owner only paid 550,000 yuan in compensation. It should be greatly increased so that dog owners who cause harm to others pay a high price. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Dog owners should also bear criminal responsibility. If the injuries suffered by the bitten girl are judged to be minor injuries, the dog owner can be held criminally liable for the crime of intentional wounding (an adult should be presumed to know the consequences of not restraining a vicious dog). If the injury does not amount to minor injuries, you can also be convicted of &quot;crime of endangering public safety&quot; because allowing ferocious dogs to roam freely in public areas has seriously threatened the safety of unspecified members of the public. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What’s more important is that dog-raising laws must be strictly enforced in normal times, and illegal dog-raising behaviors must be severely punished. You cannot always wait until the harm is caused before dealing with it, because it will be too late. If the law stipulates that aggressive dogs and large dogs cannot be kept, dogs must be tethered when taking them out of the house. But in reality, there are quite a few people who keep aggressive dogs and walk their dogs without leashes. Dog-raising management regulations in various places stipulate the management departments for dog-raising behavior. These departments should take responsibility and strictly punish illegal activities in accordance with the law. Those who illegally raise vicious dogs, neglect their management, and allow dogs to roam freely in public places must be strictly punished in accordance with the law. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, the demarcation of restricted areas and prohibited dog breeds in various places should be more detailed and scientific. The Rottweiler that bit people this time is also a violent dog that is banned in Hangzhou, Beijing and other cities, but it is not on the banned list in Chengdu. It is necessary for all localities to delineate the list of prohibited dogs in a more scientific and detailed manner, and at the same time, individuals should be prohibited from keeping aggressive dogs, regardless of whether they are in restricted areas or not. The very few who need care and need to keep aggressive dogs must obtain permission in advance, but the dogs must be kept in captivity and must not be allowed to go out. Violators will be severely punished. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Perhaps it was influenced by the vicious dog bite incident in Chongzhou. Targeted measures such as the &quot;Special Action on Civilized Dog Breeding&quot; have been carried out in many places recently. I especially hope that all parts of the country will take action and continue to do so, so as not to become a gust of wind and &quot;nephew lighting up lanterns&quot; again in a few days. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 17 Oct 2023 21:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[海底捞拒绝给玩偶过生日：应尊重企业的自主经营权丨快评]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258738]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-17 20:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Recently, some netizens posted on online platforms to complain, &quot;Does Haidilao discriminate against people who bring cotton dolls?&quot; , became a hot search topic. The post wrote that when he and his friend each brought a cotton doll to Haidilao for dinner, the waiter showed incomprehensible emotions when he asked for the doll to sit in a baby chair in the store. During the meal, the two also experienced bad experiences such as service that felt like they were being neglected, missing dishes that were not replenished until almost finished, and being rejected by the waiter when they wanted to celebrate the birthday of Cotton Doll. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Cotton dolls are a type of doll that has frequently appeared in the entertainment industry in recent years. By matching clothes and changing hairstyles, you can create a unique and exclusive doll, which is sought after by many young people. Regarding whether the doll can sit in a baby chair, Haidilao customer service said that the company has no relevant regulations and needs to consult the store. Regarding whether it is possible to celebrate the birthday of the doll, the customer service said that it is also necessary to consult the store. &quot;Under normal circumstances, birthdays are celebrated for customers.&quot; This matter has caused waves on the Internet, and it is worthy of discussion and analysis. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Haidilao is well-known in the industry for its &quot;god-like service&quot;. Many unique service categories have also won the reputation of &quot;Haidilao, you can&#39;t learn it&quot;. &quot;Celebrating birthdays for customers&quot; is one of them. As a special service, we even created derivatives such as &quot;Birthday Culture&quot; and &quot;Haidilao Birthday Song&quot;, which have won the favor and recognition of customers. If a customer goes to eat hot pot alone, Haidilao will also place a doll opposite to provide this kind of personalized service to &quot;accompany you when you go to Haidilao alone.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The customer’s behavior of “giving the doll a birthday” may be inspired by this special service. There is no shortage of posts on social media about &quot;birthday for Cotton Doll&quot;, and there are also popular posts that read &quot;Waiters are forced to stay open&quot;. The person involved this time also mentioned this in the article. I am afraid that he did this after seeing similar &quot;experience posts&quot;, intending to follow the same example and enjoy Haidilao&#39;s birthday service. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But the question is, does the waiter have an obligation to be &quot;forced to open business&quot;? Obviously, there is a difference between &quot;can&quot; and &quot;should.&quot; Haidilao &quot;can&quot; celebrate the birthdays of previous cotton dolls, but it does not mean that they &quot;should&quot; celebrate the birthdays of future cotton dolls. It can also be seen from Haidilao&#39;s response to this incident that they only have a service habit of &quot;celebrating birthdays for guests&quot;, but they do not have a service commitment of &quot;celebrating birthdays for guests&#39; dolls&quot;. Celebrating a doll’s birthday is not written into Haidilao’s service contract, nor is it an agreed-upon special service. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After all, Haidilao is just a catering company. Its main business is to provide catering services to customers, providing consumers with a variety of drinks, food, consumption venues and facilities, integrating &quot;instant processing and production, commercial sales and Service labor&quot; in one. Unique and special services are additional &quot;add-ons&quot; and are no different from marketing methods such as discount coupons, consumption coupons, and membership coupons. In addition to birthday celebrations, Haidilao also provides free manicures, free snacks and other special services, which all fall within the scope of the merchant&#39;s independent operating rights. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In other words, Haidilao&#39;s starting point for providing these special services is to enhance customers&#39; consumption experience, increase the reputation of its own brand, and bring positive feedback to business operations. However, these special services are a matter of affection, not duty. Therefore, Haidilao certainly has the right to operate independently on &quot;how to provide goods or services&quot; and has the right to adjust the rules and scope of special services. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, Haidilao has also made many adjustments, such as canceling free beef cubes, canceling free manicures in some stores, requiring at least one pot base to be ordered, no longer allowing bring-in dishes, etc. Similar measures have triggered great discussions, but they still fall within the scope of autonomous business rights and do not involve public interests such as food safety. Haidilao has the right to decide how to adjust the transaction rules, and customers also have the right to decide whether to come and consume. Everything will be left to the judgment of the market, allowing consumers to choose. There is room for two-way choices between the two parties. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is not difficult to imagine that if the waiter really fulfills the client&#39;s wish and gives the cotton doll a &quot;birthday and a doll chair&quot;, then it may also squeeze out the opportunity for customers with children to obtain the doll chair service. , or push up Haidilao’s operating costs. If some kind of incentive is formed, more dolls and even pets will celebrate their birthdays. Who will bear the rising costs? If the dining environment is regressive for ordinary customers, it is a lose-lose situation for both Haidilao and ordinary customers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Therefore, the party’s “let me go” mentality displayed between the lines of the text is also suspected of emotional blackmail: asking the merchant to provide special services that it is not obliged to provide, or even It is also unreasonable to satisfy its emotional value and cater to certain preferences of subcultural groups. Haidilao naturally has the right to refuse certain excessive or unreasonable requests. The parties concerned can look for restaurants willing to provide such services, or simply organize their own friends to open a Cotton Doll themed hot pot restaurant at their own risk and bear their own profits and losses. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, even if it is &quot;celebrating a customer&#39;s birthday&quot;, members and non-members can enjoy different services in Haidilao. After all, the cotton doll is not a real baby, and the store has the right to decide whether to treat the two-dimensional and three-dimensional dolls equally. In short, the &quot;controversial points&quot; in this incident are still within the scope of independent management rights. &quot;Whether to celebrate Cotton Doll&#39;s birthday&quot; should be left to Haidilao itself to decide. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 17 Oct 2023 20:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[第134届广交会开幕，展览总面积、展位数和参展企业数量均创历史新高]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258741]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-17 19:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;On October 16, 2023, in Guangzhou, Guangdong, two overseas buyers visited the Canton Fair venue The bustling crowd inside took photos in the background.&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/17/218f8aca90.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height =&quot;721&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/17/218f8aca90.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254274&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot; color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On October 16, 2023, in Guangzhou, Guangdong, two overseas buyers took a group photo with the bustling crowds in the Canton Fair venue as the background. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On October 15, 2023, the 134th China Import and Export Fair (Canton Fair) was officially launched.

That scenery is my hometown in a previous life. This feeling is very strong and real.&quot; Tanimura said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1980, this feeling became the creative inspiration of Shinji Tanimura. He wrote his most famous masterpiece &quot;Subaru&quot; (also called &quot;Subaru&quot;) in the future. In China, fans are accustomed to (called &quot;Star&quot;): I closed my eyes, my heart was at a loss, I looked up sadly, my eyes were full of desolation, there was only one road leading to the wilderness... I will travel far, see you again, the Pleiades hang high! ——The Pleiades star cluster is located in the constellation Taurus and consists of more than 3,000 stars. It is extremely bright in the night sky and is especially dazzling in autumn and winter. The brighter ones form the Pleiades. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In May 1980, this song was included in the album of the same name. On the album cover, a line of light and shadow cuts across the darkness. Half of Tanimura&#39;s body is buried in the darkness, and half of his body stretches out from the light. He nods slightly, eyes fixed forward, and is ready to go. This song has a melancholy tone, bleak lyrics, and sad images, but its perspective is bright. After the song came out, it became very popular in Japan and sold more than 600,000 copies. In 1987, Shinji Tanimura participated in Japan&#39;s annual &quot;Red and White Song Festival&quot; for the first time, singing &quot;Subaru&quot;, and the TV ratings exceeded 63%. Since then, he has participated in the &quot;Red and White Song Gala&quot; for many years and has become a veteran singer in this most representative show at the end of the year in Japan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In September 1980, the ATV TV series &quot;The Love of the Earth&quot; was launched. In early 1981, singer Guan Zhengjie included the Cantonese version of &quot;Star&quot; in his TV original soundtrack album &quot;The Love of the Earth&quot;, with lyrics written by Zheng Guojiang . In 1982, Teresa Teng sang the Japanese and Cantonese versions of &quot;Star&quot; at the Elizabeth Stadium concert in Hong Kong. As a result, this song became popular in southern China and radiated to the north. Singer Shen Xiaocen included the Japanese version of &quot;Star&quot; in his second album. Since then, this song has been covered by singers such as Alan Tam, Xu Xiaofeng, Feng Feifei, Han Baoyi, and Cheng Lin. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A friend told Shinji Tanimura that the picture in his mind seemed to depict Northeast China, so going to China became his dream. &quot;I have always wanted to visit China, but I don&#39;t know why. But I know that as long as I go, I will understand why I want to go to China.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http ://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/17/ErfVwIuysKLtiuXt85wPVpvEalqyFAaBsvloZd0K.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm .com/cms/medias/image/23/10/17/ErfVwIuysKLtiuXt85wPVpvEalqyFAaBsvloZd0K.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254292&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;2004 On November 5, 2019, Shinji Tanimura participated in the &quot;Jewel Heart&quot; Shanghai Concert&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1981, Tanimura Shinji participated in the &quot;Hand in Hand Beijing&quot; concert held at Beijing Workers&#39; Stadium with Chinese singers. He recalled that as soon as he landed at the Chinese airport, he felt like going home. &quot;Even the earthy smell that hit my face felt very familiar. .&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The concert lasted for two days. At this time, pop music was in its infancy in China. The tens of thousands of spectators in the work hall sat in silence, with no applause or cheers. They were used to the warm live atmosphere in Japan. Tani Cun was very uncomfortable with it. He and the members of his rock band Alice tried every means to mobilize the audience. After they sang a rhythmic song, people in the venue stood up and applauded continuously. Shinji Tanimura was very excited: &quot;Everyone feels the same about music, and music has no national boundaries.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He sang &quot;Subaru&quot; live. This was the beginning of his singing reaching the ears of Chinese audiences. So far, nearly 50 of his works have been adapted into Chinese songs, including Leslie Cheung&#39;s &quot;Who Resonates&quot; (adapted from &quot;Like a Dream&quot;), Anita Mui&#39;s &quot;Walking Alone&quot; (adapted from &quot;This&amp;nbsp;is&amp;nbsp;my&amp;nbsp;trial&quot;) &quot;), Jacky Cheung&#39;s &quot;The Distant Her&quot; (adapted from &quot;Romantic Railway&quot;), Priscilla Chan&#39;s &quot;Forgetting Sorrow&quot; (adapted from &quot;Autumn Stoppers&quot;)...&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http: //images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/17/ggCgEZS20DHJmkrzEv4rKCSqGjdClLEWCol2l890.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;597&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm. com/cms/medias/image/23/10/17/ggCgEZS20DHJmkrzEv4rKCSqGjdClLEWCol2l890.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254294&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;2007 On September 20, in Nantong, Jiangsu, at the opening ceremony of the 9th China Asian Arts Festival and the Gala &quot;Under the Same Starry Sky&quot;, Shinji Tanimura sang &quot;Flower&quot; &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>; (Visual China/Photo) &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2001, Shinji Tanimura, who was already successful, came to the Yellow River specifically to try to find similar feelings from his childhood, but found nothing. From this, he became more certain that the scene should be near Heilongjiang in Northeast China. Tanimura said with a smile: &quot;Maybe I was Chinese in my previous life.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2003, China suffered from the SARS epidemic. In order to help China fight against SARS, Shinji Tanimura held a &quot;Concert to Support China in Fighting SARS&quot; in Osaka and donated all the 15.34 million yen (approximately US$120,000) raised to the Red Cross Society of China. After SARS ended, he flew to China and held a concert to thank medical workers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the 2010 Shanghai World Expo, Teng Junjie, the chief director of the opening and closing ceremonies, invited Tanimura to perform on stage at the opening ceremony, and Tanimura agreed. For this reason, he canceled several performances in Japan and made compensation. On the evening of April 30, 2010, at the Shanghai World Expo Cultural Center, Asian girls walked out from both sides holding stars in their hands. They complemented the lights of the audience and seemed to stretch out into a galaxy. Shinji Tanimura, China&#39;s overseas promotion ambassador for the 2010 Shanghai World Expo, brought the audience to the audience. The familiar classic song &quot;Subaru&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Teng Junjie and Tani Cun have been friends for nearly 20 years. He recalled in an interview: &quot;When Abe and Koizumi were in office, (Japan) had trouble getting along with China, he went directly to Koizumi and told him that his attitude towards China must change. Japan must stand with China, and we two Asian countries must Take this responsibility.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tanimura is very willing to spend time face-to-face with young Chinese people. In March 2004, the Shanghai Conservatory of Music hired Shinji Tanimura as permanent professor of the Department of Music Engineering and consultant of the Sino-Japanese Music Culture Research Center. This job lasted until 2008. While serving as a visiting professor at the Shanghai Conservatory of Music, Shinji Tanimura spent one week every month in Shanghai. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The theme of Tanimura&#39;s class is &quot;How to express music.&quot; Start with the lyrics first. A reporter visited his class. Tanimura entered the classroom, first put half a glass of water on the table, pushed the glass over, and the water came out. He asked the students to write lyrics about it. He left the classroom for 20 minutes and came back to check. The lyrics of a classmate impressed him deeply: When water flows outside, water never knows what its own shape is... &quot;The most important thing is the inner feeling. Only there are people, and I am. If people want to be connected, music is The best medium. Music can best enter people&#39;s hearts, resonate and move, and hearts can meet.&quot; Shinji Tanimura told the reporter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The inspiration and core of the song &quot;Subaru&quot; became one of the important narratives of Shinji Tanimura&#39;s future life. As written in the song, he has always felt that &quot;starlight leads the way.&quot; When the 32-year-old Tanimura composed this song, he had no idea of ​​its vast magic, which could transcend time and travel through space, and continue to echo throughout his artistic career. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;At that time, Japan&#39;s economy was developing rapidly, giving people the illusion that as long as they had money, they could buy everything. But this song tells people: truly precious things need to be felt with the heart. Care, tenderness , consideration, love, etc., these invisible things are crucial to us.&quot; Tanimura said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For more than 40 years, he has performed and visited various Asian countries and often heard local people singing this song, regardless of gender, young or old. The other person even thought it was the song of his own country. He was once asked: &quot;Do you know this song?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;&quot;Subaru&quot; is the key to opening the door to all Asia and can connect everyone together. .&quot; Tanimura said, &quot;There is no doubt that &quot;Subaru&quot; changed my life. This song took me on a magnificent journey.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http:// images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/17/ySeRpyen0Uwh75lRWyAvnWYQHCCcx08ReNwaKxuB.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;589&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/ cms/medias/image/23/10/17/ySeRpyen0Uwh75lRWyAvnWYQHCCcx08ReNwaKxuB.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254293&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Shinji Tanimura and Teresa Teng Singing on the same stage &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>; (video screenshot/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Showa &quot;Legendary&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; On September 21, 2018, Shinji Tanimura, who was almost 70 years old, held the &quot;38th Year of Stars&quot; concert at the Shanghai Grand Theater. At the age of 25, Tanimura&#39;s hairline began to recede, and he began to grow a beard to achieve visual balance on his face. Nearly 45 years have passed, and his works have stayed at a certain point like his hairline, becoming synonymous with his achievements. And his voice is inevitably aging like his hair color. His beard and hair are all white. Even if he sings &quot;Pleiades&quot; with exactly the same arrangement, you can hear the decline in function, but there are gains and losses. At this time, It has the mellowness and sweetness given by age. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tanimura Shinji grew up and became famous during the Showa period, and he has obvious Showa characteristics. Shinji Tanimura appears in public and has a decent image. He always had a smile on his face, and his eight teeth were gleaming white. He is diligent, confident, vigorous and friendly, and uses subtle strokes to outline the complexity of the grand narrative. Since his debut, he has held 3,620 concerts in Japan and is still the number one in Japan. He has released 63 albums and 62 singles, with a total sales volume of more than 30 million. He is called the godfather of the Japanese music industry. In the media description, he always promotes Sino-Japanese friendship from the bottom of his heart, cultivates young people with full expectations, and pours his blood into music. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Perhaps partly due to the language barrier, Chinese reporters said his voice was soft and slow. If you don’t prick up your ears to distinguish it carefully, it may even be masked by the sound of the indoor air conditioner. &quot;People are as quiet as songs.&quot; But if you listen to his works and understand his experience, both the premise and the conclusion of this sentence will be invalid. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1948, Shinji Tanimura was born in Osaka. When he was a child, he was overweight and was nicknamed &quot;Fat Pig&quot; by his classmates. His self-esteem was greatly affected. When he was in elementary school, he heard singer Xiao Linxu singing &quot;Migratory Bird&quot; in a performance. He was attracted by Xiao Linxu&#39;s gesture of strumming the guitar and started learning guitar, deciding to regain his confidence. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1965, he formed the band Rock Candie with his classmates. Their style was more country folk and their rebellious playing style made the audience feel novel. In 1970, this band held an &quot;American Continent Tour&quot;. They first arrived in Vancouver. Because they were too poor, they had to take a bus across the North American continent all the way to New York. After ten days of tossing, they finally reached their destination. In New York, Shinji Tanimura watched a local rock performance. He shed tears at Janis Joplin&#39;s performance, &quot;It turns out that music still has such a possibility.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After returning to China, He formed a new band, Alice, but the band&#39;s American blues style was not accepted by the Japanese audience. Alice had to perform in various places to meet daily expenses and continue her acting career. During her frequent performances, Alice set a record of holding 303 concerts a year. As the band&#39;s popularity expanded in various places, their songs such as &quot;Winter Thunder and Lightning&quot; and &quot;The Pledge of Tears&quot; also gradually became popular. In 1978, they became the first group of Japanese artists to successfully hold a three-day concert at Nippon Budokan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/17/Ampapw9ET99MTYyV8EyROgmZOTbNC7vffFfSy6l6.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/17/Ampapw9ET99MTYyV8EyROgmZOTbNC7vffFfSy6l6.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254291&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On September 28, 2018, in Beijing, Shinji Tanimura held the &quot;38 Years of Stars&quot; concert &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>; (Visual China/Photo) &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In November 1974, Shinji Tanimura&#39;s first solo album &quot;蜜&quot; was released. He wrote the lyrics and music for the entire album. One year later, in December, Tanimura Shinji released his second solo album &quot;Umimako&quot;. In this quiet work, there are many shining works, such as &quot;Port Lights&quot;, &quot;Sunflower&quot;, &quot;Warmth&quot;, &quot;Sunset&quot;, &quot;The Road of Sand&quot;... After entering the 1980s, Tanimura produced more and more excellent works. In the 1990s, the theme song &quot;Fengzihuaden&quot; of Toei animation &quot;Three Kingdoms&quot; was released, and &quot;Hometown&quot;, a collaboration with singer and actor Yuzo Kayama... are all Widespread. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tanimura’s life is very interesting. After a concert, he once walked into a small bookstore and offered himself to collect money for the store manager while he was having dinner. Fans who come to the bookstore after listening to Tanimura&#39;s concert will receive an oncoming surprise when paying. In Japanese variety shows in the 1990s, he was experienced, relaxed, unencumbered, and spoke humorously. One second he was not ashamed to share his embarrassing story with the host: due to a bad gastrointestinal condition, the stool collapsed in his pants when he farted; the next second he picked up the guitar and taught them his valuable experience in the music industry for many years: the most important thing is the song Express your heart, not whether it can be passed down to the world or how many people will sing it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In his later years, Tanimura conducted a deeper exploration of musical expression. The subtleties of his singing have been accurate to every modal word. In the song &quot;Woo Hu&quot;, he poured different techniques into each &quot;ah&quot; to achieve the emotions he expected, such as the feelings in his heart that he wanted to suppress but couldn&#39;t. Sigh while staying. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2017, Tanimura held a concert &quot;Commemorating the 45th Anniversary of the Normalization of Diplomatic Relations between China and Japan - 2017 Shinji Tanimura&#39;s 45th Anniversary of His Performing Career in Shanghai&quot; at the Shanghai Grand Theater. At the scene, a beam of chasing light hit the side of the stage and enveloped an empty chair. The prelude of &quot;Restaurant Corner&quot; sounded, and on the other side of the stage, Tanimura picked up the microphone and said: &quot;Next, I will sing a set of narrative love songs for everyone...&quot; &quot;Narrative Love Songs&quot; is his new attempt ——&quot;Explain&quot; the ins and outs of creating the song at the beginning of each song by chatting and heart-to-heart with the audience. In a set of five &quot;narrative love songs&quot;, Tanimura uses the woman&#39;s mood and the man&#39;s perspective to connect the ups and downs of love emotions, just like a love short film. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To commemorate the &quot;two 45th anniversaries&quot;, Tanimura released a set of three albums called &quot;Standard&quot;, each with 15 songs, for a total of 45 songs. The first album is representative works selected from the songs he composed; the second album is taken from Alice&#39;s period works; and the third album is Japanese classic songs sung by him. His criteria for selecting tracks to enter this album are: &quot;Children 100 years from now will think that these works are indeed classics.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These tracks are also arranged in the order of the ups and downs of life and the ups and downs of emotions. The first part is full of ambition, and in the end there will be a starry reverie like &quot;Pleiades&quot;: &quot;A person&#39;s daily life must be ups and downs, but he will not stick to these emotions and feelings every day. Life and music have something in common . I want to reflect the ups and downs of life into music... Even if the melody on the stage is occasionally sad and disappointing, it must be exciting and upward in the end!&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;September 28, 2018, The &quot;38th Year of Stars&quot; concert in Beijing became Shinji Tanimura&#39;s last public performance in China. On October 8, 2023, Shinji Tanimura died of illness at the age of 74. The funeral was held on October 15, with only close relatives in attendance. On October 16, the news of his death was made public. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(Comprehensive reports from Global Figures, The Paper, Xinmin Evening News, etc.)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br >;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/ a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 17 Oct 2023 18:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[2023年前8个月基本医保基金收入同比增长9.3%]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258746]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-17 17:30:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;The National Medical Insurance Administration recently released data showing that from January to August 2023, the basic medical insurance fund (including maternity insurance ) total revenue was 2.092333 billion yuan, a year-on-year increase of 9.3%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among them, the income of the basic medical insurance fund for employees (including maternity insurance) was 1.473806 billion yuan, a year-on-year increase of 13%; the income of the basic medical insurance fund for urban and rural residents was 618.527 billion yuan, a year-on-year increase of 1.3%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Data show that from January to August 2023, the total expenditure of the basic medical insurance fund (including maternity insurance) was 1.786477 billion yuan, a year-on-year increase of 18.3%.

In the history of the Nobel Prize, it is the class with the second most female winners and the second highest proportion. In 2009, there were the most female award winners, with 5 women winning the award, accounting for the highest proportion of 38% (5/13, a total of 13 people won the award that year). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This year’s four female winners are Katalin Karikó, the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine; Anne L’Huillier, the Physics Prize ); Narges Mohammadi for the Peace Prize and Claudia Goldin for the Economics Prize. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Interestingly, the achievement that won the economics prize was the study of gender differences. US economist Claudia Goldin was awarded the prize for her research on key drivers of gender differences in women&#39;s participation in the labor market. The award citation said her research &quot;has advanced our understanding of women&#39;s labor market outcomes&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In layman’s terms, Goldin won the award for studying why women’s income is not as good as men’s. This can be seen as the gender difference in labor remuneration between men and women. Gender differences exist in all aspects of social life, and even the winning of Nobel Prizes has huge gender differences. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Golding not only studies the difference in income between men and women, but even after winning the award, he complained that there were more men than women in the economics prize. She said that &quot;serious inequality still exists&quot; between men and women in the Nobel Prize in Economics. Indeed, Goldin is the third female economist to win the Economics Prize. From 1969 (the Nobel Prize in Economics began to be awarded in 1969) to 2023, the Nobel Prize in Economics has been awarded 55 times, with a total of 93 winners, of which women account for only 3.2%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Looking at the Nobel Prize comprehensively from the statistical data on the official website of the Nobel Prize, the gender gap between men and women winning prizes is also quite disparate. From 1901 to 2023, the Nobel Prize was awarded a total of 621 times, with 970 individuals and 30 organizations (groups) winning the prize, and a total of 1,000 people and organizations winning the prize. Among them, 65 are women. Looking at individual proportions, the proportion of women is about 6.7% (65/970). However, if we take into account that Marie Curie won the prize twice (in 1903 for Physics and 1911 for Chemistry), only 64 women won the prize, so the actual proportion is 6.6% (64/970). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Looking at the various Nobel Prize categories, due to wars and various reasons, different Nobel Prize categories in history have had different awards and number of winners. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since 1901, the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine has been awarded 114 times, with a total of 227 winners, of which 13 were women, accounting for 5.7%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Physics Prize was awarded 117 times, with 225 winners, of which 5 were female winners, accounting for 2.2%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Chemistry Prize was awarded 115 times, with 194 winners, of which 8 were female winners, accounting for 4.1%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Literature Prize was awarded 116 times, with 120 winners, of which 17 were female winners, accounting for 14.2%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Peace Prize has been awarded 104 times, with 141 winners, of which 19 were female winners, accounting for 13.5%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Looking at the six awards, the highest proportion of female winners is the Literature Award, which is 14.2%, and the lowest is the Physics Award, where women account for 2.2%. The economics prize that Golding complained about is considered good. Women account for 3.2%, which is not the bottom. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Why is the proportion of female winners so low? Looking at the total number, they only account for 10.3%. In this regard, Goldin analyzed that the reasons why women earn less than men can also be used to explain. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although Goldin believes that there are many reasons for the gender pay gap, such as gender discrimination, she coined a term - greed for work to explain it, believing that this is the main reason. Greedy work is when a person works longer hours or has less control over their hours and is paid disproportionately more per hour, effectively penalizing women who need to seek flexible labor. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, this situation also creates a lose-lose situation for both sexes. For men, they give up time with their families, while for women, they often give up their careers. The essence is that many jobs pay much higher hourly rates when working longer hours, being on call, busy schedules, evenings and weekends, or unpredictable hours. However, in most couples who are highly educated, have careers and children, the woman is the on-call professional at home, and the man is the on-call professional at work. Therefore, men earn more than women. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The reason behind this is that women have to have children and take care of the family, so they have less time to work, and of course their income is less than men. If this reason is used to explain why women have only accounted for 10.3% of Nobel Prize winners over the past 100 years, it is also valid. Because women devote less time to work and research than men, this prevents them from achieving higher achievements in different fields and therefore winning Nobel Prizes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Whenever career and work achieve results, one is talent and the other is diligence. There may be different opinions on the proportion of the two, but it cannot be denied that diligence is the most important factor in producing results. factor. &quot;A person who is capable of one thing can benefit himself by a hundred, and a person who is capable of ten can benefit himself by a thousand.&quot; This is the true meaning of it. As long as you engage in a job or profession, and persevere over a long period of time, practice makes perfect and results will come. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The importance of professional perseverance can also be seen from the history of the Nobel Prize. As long as women participate in scientific research and work, the chances and number of awards will increase. From 1901 to 1925, 4 women won the award; from 1926 to 1950, 8 women won the award; from 1951 to 1975, 3 women won the award; from 1976 to 2000, 15 women won the award Award-winning, from 2001 to 2023, 35 women won the award. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In comparison, in the 50 years from 1901 to 1950, 12 women won the award, but in the 22 years from 2001 to 2023, 35 women won the award. This not only shows that the number of female award-winners has increased with the development of the times, but also shows that modern women’s large-scale participation in work and scientific research is an important reason why they can achieve the same results and win awards as men. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These explanations and facts are also reflected in Golding&#39;s research. In her latest book, &quot;Career and Family: Women&#39;s Centennial Journey to Equality,&quot; she mentions the impact of multiple factors on women&#39;s careers, such as the history of women&#39;s pursuit of careers and families, coeducation in higher education, and the impact of birth control pills on women&#39;s careers. The impact of women&#39;s career and marriage decisions, women&#39;s married surnames as a social indicator, and the reasons why women make up the majority of undergraduate students. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Goldin analyzes more than two hundred years of data to demonstrate how and why gender differences in earnings and employment rates have changed, such as the use of birth control pills, which has provided new insights into women&#39;s career plans. opportunities, giving them more time and opportunity to work and participate in scientific research, so that they can achieve the same results as men, and these results may win the Nobel Prize. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Therefore, receiving higher education, participating in work and scientific research are important foundations for women to gradually win more Nobel Prizes and increase their income. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 17 Oct 2023 16:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[独臂船长徐京坤和他的超级赛船丨封面人物]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258546]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-17 15:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/11/3KlQURn8IAiq75Cy8HWajQ9l7ECu7pLrtLJOg8Ig.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/3KlQURn8IAiq75Cy8HWajQ9l7ECu7pL rtLJOg8Ig. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253648&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On September 23, 2023, at Qingdao Olympic Sailing Center, Xu Jingkun sailed a sailboat out to sea&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern People Weekly reporter Liang Chen/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the autumn of 2021, Xu Jingkun decided to buy a super racing boat to participate in the 2024 Vendée Singles.

I used to sail around the China Sea and around the world. Most people can do it with hard work, but entering the field of racing , everything is different.&quot; Xu Jingkun calls the recognition from the media and insiders &quot;everyone&#39;s praise&quot;. He himself does not take it too seriously. Only when he talks about his identity as &quot;rowing captain&quot;, he is full of pride. . &quot;Although I used to sail my own boats and others called me &#39;captain&#39; very early on, in my mind, I didn&#39;t really consider myself a captain until I drove IMOCA60 and managed the racing team.&quot;&lt;/p >; &lt;p>;IMOCA60 is the designated boat type for the 2024 Vendée Globe. In 2007, Xu Jingkun was training overseas in Rhode Island, USA as a member of the Chinese Disabled Sailing Team. He saw the IMOCA racing boat on the cover of a sailing magazine for the first time. &quot;It&#39;s so dreamy, like a spaceship!&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/esXSHu2ovTOfUKr558ukBPh2CzYb143BbZNgzYBv.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/esXSHu2ovTOfUKr558ukBPh2CzYb143BbZNgzYBv.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253646 &quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Xu Jingkun gathered with friends at the restaurant bar where he worked back then&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern Characters Weekly reporter Liang Chen/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;With the continuous upgrade of IMOCA racing performance, traveling around the world in 80 days has long since become a reality from science fiction. The route of the Vendée Globe is not the most economical and safe trade wind route. Instead, it tries its best to incorporate dangerous capes, equatorial windless zones, and stormy waves into the course. Even so, there have been five captains in the history of the Vendée Globe. After reaching the 80-day mark, the fastest record is 74 days, 3 hours, 35 minutes and 46 seconds. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xu Jingkun never thought that one day after the Paralympic sailing team was disbanded, he would go out to sea alone, own a super racing boat, and race against the waves with the captains of the world&#39;s top professional racing boats. In 2021, there are less than 20 hydrofoil super single-hull racing boats in the world. Standing on the boat, he had a strong sense of unreality. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;IMOCA60 integrates the most cutting-edge monohull sailboat design and shipbuilding technology. The signature design is the swinging keel inserted vertically into the sea and the hydrofoils extending from both sides of the hull. The carbon fiber hydrofoils are light and elegant but strong enough to When standing in the wind, it looks like the wings of a flying fish, helping the ship reduce the friction of the water and achieve faster speeds. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/igg3a26AZN6NW6OYjC1NyCVraXPlAaupJur759F5.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/igg3a26AZN6NW6OYjC1NyCVraXPlAaupJur759F5.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253641&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Xu Jingkun and his wife Xiao Shuyao in their first year of circumnavigation&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo provided by interviewee)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p >; &lt;p>;It can sail unimpeded in the world&#39;s dangerous sea areas and harsh sea conditions, with a maximum instantaneous speed of more than 40 knots (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: italics, italics_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;1 knot Equivalent to 1 nautical mile per hour, which is 1.852 kilometers per hour&lt;/span>;). If captains want to stay ahead of others in the Vendée Globe, they must maintain an average boat speed of more than 20 knots day and night for several months. The resistance of sea water, the load of ships and the attack of storms mean that the optimal speed of modern warships can only be about 30 knots. For a full carbon fiber monohull ship, traveling at such a speed in the deep sea is already equivalent to traveling at sea. Driving an F1 car. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Before I boarded a ship for the first time, I had never experienced it in real life. I only learned about it from watching videos. When I got on board, I found that the ship was really ‘flying’ on the sea.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since Xu Jingkun was selected into the Chinese Disabled Sailing Team in 2005, he has been constantly exposed to various types of boats. He has completed extreme challenges such as a solo circumnavigation of the China Sea and a non-stop solo transatlantic crossing in a 6.5-meter boat. He also used it with his wife Xiao Shuyao. It took three years for the Chinese to complete the first catamaran circumnavigation of the world. &quot;Among the many boats I have sailed before, none of them can compare with it. It is a completely different concept.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; A brand-new IMOCA60 sells for more than nine million euros. He bought a second-hand boat with excellent performance for &quot;only&quot; two to three million euros. Parking the ship at the pier of the port of Lorient, France, he carefully hung a sign on the bow to remind passing ships to keep their distance, &quot;Don&#39;t touch my ship, I can&#39;t repair it.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p >;From then to now, he is always short of money. “The money on hand is not enough to overhaul a racing boat.” The money to buy the boat is sponsored by various brothers who love sailing. “I have never had a dedicated business team to help I found all the big sponsors myself.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When he bought the boat, he insisted on going to France alone. &quot;I didn&#39;t even bring any luggage, I just carried a backpack.&quot; He had already done it. Plan and save when you can. &quot;The road ahead is too long, and we may not be able to go on at any time due to lack of funds.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is no upper limit on the budget to form a racing team. In his words, &quot;Buy The boat is the first step. To maintain the racing boat every offseason, you have to spend money to buy a boat.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The labor cost alone for a large racing team is one to two hundred per season. 10,000 euros, &quot;We have kept the funds to a minimum.

His subordinates are the press officer, translator, administrator, and cashier of the fleet.

It was only after writing his book &quot;The Humble Dreamer&quot; that I learned about those past experiences.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I read that book carefully and was very touched. &quot;Yin Zhicheng is the deputy general manager of the Dolphin Club of Qingdao Maritime Vocational School and has come into contact with many sailing people. &quot;Jingkun is very focused and will not be easily distracted. He is persistent in his goals and moves forward step by step. When others look up, they will find that He has reached unattainable heights. ”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“The biggest characteristic of Jingkun is rigor and professionalism,” Noah Tianze Insurance Brokerage Company has been a partner of Xu Jingkun and Xiao Shuyao since they started sailing around the world on a catamaran in 2017, and has been providing services to them until now. The racing team provides insurance services. Tianze Chairman Tian Feng pays close attention to the status of the racing boats. &quot;In the Coffee Road 1,200 nautical mile qualifying competition, they must pass through the storm stage according to regulations and chase the storm. The racing boats are intact, which fully proves that He does his job very carefully. For such a big boat, he has to personally maintain every detail to achieve such a state. This professionalism is responsible for himself, his sponsors, and his family. ”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Actually, I still occasionally have (emotional) outbursts at sea. &quot;When Rum Road crossed the Atlantic alone in 2022, he passed through three major storms in a row, with the maximum wind force exceeding 70 knots. &quot;The whole sea surface was howling like ghosts, which was very scary. &quot;Alone in the wind and waves, Xu Jingkun roared at the sea, &quot;Come on! How about it! &quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He laughed, &quot;No one has seen me like that, and I haven&#39;t told anyone before. Very dramatic, shouting and driving my boat into the wind and waves! ”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“I also did a very risky thing that time.” There were 8 sails on the IMOCA60 racing boat, each of which weighed more than 100 kilograms. When running down Rum Road, the strong wind blew Three sails were damaged. &quot;One sail fell directly into the sea, and the ship was still running. The more than 300 square meters of sail carried dozens of tons of seawater, and it was impossible to pull it up by human power. Xu Jingkun jumped into the cold Atlantic Ocean with a sharp blade, &quot;cut it bit by bit, cut it into pieces and brought it back.&quot; &quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The most taboo thing about deep-sea navigation is the separation of people and ships. In the depths of the ocean, even rescue forces are unable to reach it. &quot;After thinking about it afterwards, I still can&#39;t do this in the future. Xu Jingkun said that this kind of behavior was seriously inconsistent with his rational and steady nature, and he couldn&#39;t even explain it. &quot;But these are the thoughts of people on the shore under normal circumstances. In emergencies, your thoughts will be different.&quot; If I don&#39;t jump into the sea, the sail may sink the boat and the game will be terminated. I have paid so much for this game and I am absolutely not willing to give up like this. My boat is not just a boat, it is like my child and it is impossible not to save it. ”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to courageous adventure races, there are also many transmissions of love between people and ships and people in extreme sailing. In 2020, Vendée Globe staged the 61-year-old legendary sailor Jean. The story of Le Cam and several captains risking their lives to rescue Captain Kevin whose ship suffered a catastrophic breakage, Xu Jingkun, who rarely sheds tears, said, “These stories can easily touch my tears. ”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Captains know how to express love. Sailors who have helped each other in the most dangerous seas often participate in the Coffee Road Double Transatlantic Race. Xiao Shuyao posted on the “Xu Jingkun Global Sailing Team” public account In addition to publishing news about Xu Jingkun’s racing team, it also introduces many sailing heroes and maritime legends. She wrote this paragraph-&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“In 1997, the year before, I was in the Vendée Globe in an 80-knot storm. Pete Goss, who saved Rafael Dinelli from almost hypothermia, attended Dinelli&#39;s wedding as the best man, and the two teamed up to come to Café Road and won the CLASS2 category championship, becoming a leader in the offshore sailing industry. A beautiful talk. In 2012, 18 hours after the Vendée Jean Le Cam (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: italics, italics_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Yes, the one who rescued people in 2020&lt;/span>;) capsized , Vincent Riou came to save his life, and the two teamed up to win the IMOCA category championship on Café Road. It seems to have become a tradition for the combination of life and death in the Vendée to come to the Café Road to win the championship. &quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Ah Jiu knows how to sail! &quot;Although he always likes to jokingly call Xiao Shuyao &quot;unreliable Ah Jiu&quot;, he knows her preciousness in his heart.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xu Jingkun sincerely praised these maritime legends that transcended victory and defeat, &quot;I like to hear them very much. She told me these people and stories, but when I asked her, she couldn&#39;t stop, so I shouted stop, stop, I&#39;m going to work...&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Reporter from &quot;Southern People Weekly&quot; When I met Xu Jingkun in Qingdao at the end of September, it was less than a month before the coffee road started. “I was too tired some time ago and I have to adjust. There was basically nothing arranged when I came back this time. &quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We walked to the Olympic Sailing Center together. The autumn wind blew over, and he squinted his eyes, &quot;Awesome! This is the best season! Very comfortable! &quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;What happened to your left arm? ”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The janitor of the Qingdao Olympic Sailing Center had a tanned face. He may not have been in the city for long, and he still spoke with a local accent. Xu Jingkun and a group of people passed by him, and the eldest brother blurted out such a question. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“I had an accident when I was a kid. &quot;Xu Jingkun&#39;s tone and expression were very calm, and he stopped and looked at the eldest brother with a smile.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The janitor brother sat still, raised his face, his eyes were full of concern and love , continued to ask with the directness and enthusiasm of a villager, &quot;How is your life now? ”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Okay, pretty good. ”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He pointed us to the place where his “Dream” once docked, “There, next to the red ship.” ”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 17 Oct 2023 15:25:04 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
