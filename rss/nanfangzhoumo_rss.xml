On the same day, Guo Meimei confirmed the matter to reporters from Nandu and N Video, saying that everything was fine now and she wanted to &quot;rest for a while first.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After returning to the social platform, she disbanded the fan group she formed. The million-fan account she created after her first release from prison now only has 6 Weibo posts left to view. Prior to this, Guo Meimei&#39;s last appearance was at a public court hearing in August 2021. In October of the same year, she was sentenced for selling poisonous and harmful food. This was the second time she was sentenced in a criminal case. She was sentenced to five years in prison for opening a casino and was released in July 2019. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Twelve years ago, a modification of the authentication information made Guo Meimei become the first generation Internet celebrity, and she became famous for a while. At that time, Guo Meimei admitted in an interview with a reporter from Nandu that she had the desire to be famous, but &quot;don&#39;t want to be famous in this way.&quot; However, for more than ten years, words such as &quot;showing off wealth&quot;, &quot;going to jail&quot;, &quot;gambling&quot; and &quot;selling fake medicine&quot; have gradually become entangled with her name. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/116df681e74128d4a9bca29fbe552420.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height= &quot;437&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/116df681e74128d4a9bca29fbe552420.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;250672&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On September 12, Guo Meimei’s personal social account was updated after being discontinued for nearly three years. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Jailed for the second time&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;On September 12, Guo Meimei’s personal social account, which has been disconnected for nearly three years, posted a new message - &quot;Slowly understand the world, slowly Update yourself slowly”. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After announcing her return on social platforms, Guo Meimei’s first move was to disband her fan group. She once generously shared her updates in the fan group, and some fans said, &quot;We have been in the group for all these years, and then we disbanded the group.&quot; Regarding this, she explained, &quot;I had some ideas of my own, so I disbanded.&quot; Guo Meimei also told Nandu reporters that everything is fine now and she wants to &quot;rest for a while first.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Guo Meimei’s last Weibo update was in December 2020, and her last public appearance was at a public trial two years ago. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On August 13, 2021, the first instance trial of Guo Meimei and others suspected of producing and selling toxic and harmful food was held in the Shanghai Railway Transport Court. Screenshots of the court hearing showed that the defendants Guo Meimei and Wang Zouya were brought into the court by bailiffs wearing protective clothing. During the statement stage, Guo Meimei shed tears and confessed. In the end, she wiped her tears with her hands and was taken away by the bailiff. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/482c73cce6e1a98a05c40064770e39c3.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height= &quot;360&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/482c73cce6e1a98a05c40064770e39c3.png&quot; data-key=&quot;250671&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The court hearing scene. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 18, the Shanghai Railway Transport Court publicly pronounced its verdict on the case of Guo Meimei and Wang Zouya selling toxic and harmful food in accordance with the law. Guo Meimei was sentenced to two years and six years in prison for selling toxic and harmful food. months and a fine of RMB 200,000; Wang Zouya was sentenced to seven months in prison and fined RMB 10,000. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Guo Meimei’s “second entry into the palace” can be traced back to 2020 at the earliest. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At that time, Guo Meimei was running a newly opened social account &quot;Guo Meimei May Work Hard&quot; after she was released from prison for the first time. It attracted the attention of more than one million fans in just over a year. She sells goods through multiple channels by building a fan group and diverting traffic from Weibo to WeChat. &quot;Slimming&quot; is a word that often appears on her Weibo. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Guo Meimei’s high-profile actions attracted attention. In December 2020, the Economic Investigation Detachment of Shanghai Pudong Public Security Bureau received a clue that someone was selling fake weight loss pills online. The manufacturing and sales den promotes its products through online advertisements to attract beauty-loving women. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to a report from the Shanghai police, on March 11, 2021, the Pudong police successfully detected a case of producing and selling weight-loss foods with banned ingredients (sibutramine), and arrested the production worker Guo Moumou (female, 30 years old) and other 32 criminal suspects have been detained in accordance with the law. Nandu reporters confirmed from authoritative sources close to the Shanghai police that the 30-year-old Guo Moumou involved in the report was none other than Guo Meimei. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The public prosecution agency accused Guo Meimei and Wang Zouya of knowingly knowing that the slimming candies sold at the premises of their previous owner Zhao (handled in a separate case) may illegally contain sibutramine since January and February 2021 respectively. Even under such circumstances, they are still sold at unit prices of 699 yuan per box. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Up to the time of the incident, Guo Meimei had sold more than 100 boxes of slimming candies and received more than 70,000 yuan in payment. During this period, Guo Meimei also helped Wang Zouya order and pay Zhao, and jointly sold 4 boxes of slimming candies, receiving RMB 2,796. After the incident, the public security organs detected sibutramine in the diet candy seized. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the day of the first-instance trial, a relevant person from the prosecution revealed to Nandu reporters that before the trial, Guo Meimei had signed a confession of guilt and punishment. However, during the trial, Guo Meimei defended whether she “subjectively and knowingly” knew that the weight loss pills sold contained sibutramine. &quot;Whether this behavior constitutes &#39;repentance&#39; and whether it will be considered as a sentencing circumstance needs to be determined by the judge.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;First arrest&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;When Guo Meimei was detained by Pudong police in accordance with the law, she was She was released from prison in Changsha only 607 days ago. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In July 2014, Guo Meimei and others were criminally detained by the Dongcheng Branch of the Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau on suspicion of gambling crimes. After investigation, Guo Meimei confessed to the illegal and criminal facts of participating in gambling and organizing gambling during the World Cup football match, and also confessed to the criminal facts of long-term participation in gambling activities and opening gambling bureaus for making huge profits. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Long-term gambling began in 2010, long before the &quot;Guo Meimei incident&quot; that made it famous. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The police found that between 2010 and 2014, Guo Meimei traveled to and from Macau, Hong Kong and surrounding countries for gambling more than 60 times. At the end of 2012, Guo Meimei met Kang, a foreign professional Texas Hold&#39;em gambler, at a Macau casino. The two soon developed into lovers and lived together in Beijing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2013, Guo Meimei changed from gambling to gambling. In February of the same year, Guo Meimei and Kang planned to open a casino in Beijing. Their life assistant Lu Moumou came forward to rent a house in the west tower of Beijing Mansion in Chaoyang District at a monthly rent of 19,000 yuan for the gambling establishment. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After setting up the venue, Guo Meimei and Kang purchased gaming tables, chips, and POS machines, and invited dealers. Later, Guo Meimei personally called her friends to invite her to gamble. The first time, Guo Meimei invited 6 people, and she made a profit of 70,000 yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Guo Meimei was not satisfied with this. Her assistant at the time, Lu Moumou, once revealed that Guo Meimei felt that it was inadequate and said, &quot;A woman still has to be in charge. Next time I will set up the card game myself.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After that, Guo Meimei hired a professional dealer every time, found someone to be responsible for settling gambling funds, and called or sent WeChat messages to invite &quot;friends&quot; to come and gamble. She herself took 3% to 5%. Rebate points are used as &quot;water money&quot;. According to verification by the Beijing police, the amount of money Guo Meimei opened in each gambling game was more than one million yuan, and she personally made hundreds of thousands of yuan in illegal profits through &quot;extracting money.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In June 2014, the 20th World Cup opened. On July 9, Beijing police busted a criminal gang that organized gambling during the World Cup and arrested eight gang members. The gang opened accounts on overseas gambling websites, placed bets through phone calls, WeChat and other forms, and carried out illegal and criminal activities in sports betting. Guo Meimei is one of them. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/5d97ac8fe5e01fc678810ad328c66a6f.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;690&quot; height= &quot;460&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/5d97ac8fe5e01fc678810ad328c66a6f.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;250670&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The court hearing scene. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On September 10, 2015, the case of Guo Meimei suspected of opening a casino was publicly heard in Beijing Dongcheng Court. The criminal verdict of the case showed that the defendant Guo Meimei (formerly known as Guo Meiling) was sentenced to five years in prison and fined RMB 50,000 for opening a casino with a gambling capital of more than 2 million yuan. His sentence is from July 14, 2014 to July 13, 2019. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The first generation of Internet celebrities&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Nandu reporters have verified from multiple cross-source sources that Guo Meimei has been serving her sentence in Changsha Women’s Prison and has not received a commutation during her sentence. After serving 1,825 days in prison, Guo Meimei was released from prison on July 13, 2019. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, a recent photo of Guo Meimei after she was released from prison was exposed. In the photo, Guo Meimei is wearing a peaked cap and light makeup, but her figure is no longer slender and her face is swollen. She admitted that after she was released from prison, she found herself out of touch with society and gained twenty pounds due to hyperthyroidism. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But Guo Meimei was not depressed by this. As a former &quot;Internet celebrity&quot;, Guo Meimei&#39;s ability to use the Internet was once again demonstrated. Soon after she was released from prison, she actively tried online platforms such as Weibo, live broadcasts, and short videos. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She attributed this to her &quot;survival instincts that were honed&quot; during her five years in prison. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Guo Meimei once said in an interview that she did not sleep a wink for two days and two nights after she was released from prison. She has been receiving a large number of messages online. In about a month, she figured out what the most popular software is and how to use it. use. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After only more than 2 months of silence, Guo Meimei opened a Weibo account &quot;Guo Meimei May Work Hard&quot; and returned to the public eye. On September 30, 2019, she posted her first Weibo post saying, &quot;I am working hard to transform, learn more knowledge and talents, and then refine myself!&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, she also posted A selfie taken while sitting in a car. Her hair has been cut short and dyed, and her makeup is exquisite. The photo is also tagged &quot;Guo Meimei&#39;s comeback.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since then, luxury goods, luxury cars, star-rated hotels and other &quot;standard equipment&quot; that show wealth have once again appeared on Guo Meimei&#39;s Weibo. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In July 2020, she posted a video of looking at cars, saying, &quot;I plan to order a convertible Bentley. You should spend money when you are young. If you save money, you will not be able to take it with you even if you die.&quot;; In November 2020, She also posted a house viewing video, saying, &quot;I accidentally bought a new house when I came to Changsha to perform. I paid for it after watching it in the afternoon.&quot; In February 2021, she posted a pink Rolls-Royce on Weibo, saying It’s “Give yourself a New Year’s gift.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Guo Meimei once said in an exclusive interview with a reporter from Nandu that she is indeed somewhat vain and likes to show off expensive things. But she insisted that her target was not all ordinary people, but fans on Weibo. “Just like good sisters, I am just sharing my daily life.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In November 2019, only two months after her comeback, she created a fan group on Weibo. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In February 2020, she replied to netizens in a Weibo comment saying that she was an e-commerce company selling &quot;clothes and facial masks.&quot; After experiencing the ups and downs of &quot;entrepreneurship&quot; such as her live broadcast account being blocked and her online clothing store closed due to poor operation, Guo Meimei found a more effective &quot;wealth password&quot;, which is to use Weibo to divert traffic to WeChat to sell goods. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She actively &quot;does business&quot; on Weibo, posting a large number of photos of herself, and has appeared in the comment area many times to ask netizens to add her assistant&#39;s WeChat account, &quot;My daily outfits are all for sale.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Guo Meimei&#39;s ability to create hot topics can be seen from the first selfie posted at the beginning of her comeback with the label &quot;Guo Meimei Comeback&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Under that photo, the most liked comment was &quot;I got plastic surgery as soon as I got out of prison, it&#39;s amazing.&quot; Later, she also generously admitted that she had &quot;had a nose done&quot;. Because she was not satisfied with the results, she took out the prosthesis and adjusted it. She also posted on Weibo the experience of undergoing &quot;rib nose surgery&quot; and the brand name of the plastic surgery hospital. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After that, the plastic surgery hospital officially became her &quot;partner&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Only one and a half years after Weibo was launched, the number of fans of the &quot;Guo Mei May Hard Work&quot; account has exceeded one million. In addition to posting her WeChat account in her introduction, saying &quot;Performance, weight loss + VX&quot;, she also posted on Weibo many times to promote her WeChat account, declaring, &quot;If you want to become beautiful, come to me&quot; and &quot;If you want to make money, come to me.&quot; . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/2f0fae35a5347bb78c6658640367eafa.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height= &quot;518&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/2f0fae35a5347bb78c6658640367eafa.png&quot; data-key=&quot;250673&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Guo Meimei has promoted her WeChat account on Weibo many times. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Desire to be famous&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The above-mentioned WeChat account is called &quot;Guo Meimei Work Account&quot;, and the circle of friends contains a lot of content promoting medical cosmetic surgery and selling slimming candies. A screenshot of a chat with a &quot;customer&quot; claimed that he &quot;lost seven or eight pounds&quot; after eating a box. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The details of the case disclosed by the Shanghai police show that the manufacturing and sales den where Guo Meimei is located is promoted by posting advertisements online to attract beauty-loving women. The banned ingredient &quot;sibutramine&quot; is added to this weight-loss drug. Although it has a weight-loss effect, it can cause harm to the body. The amount involved in the case exceeded 50 million yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Today, the account &quot;Guo Mei May works hard&quot; only has 6 Weibo posts left to view. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Twelve years ago, a change in authentication information brought the Weibo account &quot;Guo Meimei Baby&quot; into the public eye. On June 20, 2011, Guo Meimei, whose certification information is &quot;Commercial General Manager of the Red Cross Society of China&quot;, showed off her luxurious life on Weibo, claiming to &quot;live in a big villa and drive a Maserati&quot;, causing an uproar. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Red Cross Society of China clarified that there is no &quot;Red Cross Chamber of Commerce&quot; organization, let alone &quot;Guo Meimei&quot;, but doubts still arise one after another. Affected by this, one month after the incident, the charitable donations received by the Red Cross societies across China dropped sharply, and their credibility was questioned. Other official charities were also implicated. The amount of donations received by charitable organizations dropped by 86% from June to August. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On August 4, 2011, Guo Meimei apologized in tears on a TV show, saying that she certified the &quot;Commercial General Manager of the Red Cross Society of China&quot; out of vanity and comparison mentality, and emphasized that everything had nothing to do with the Red Cross Society. . However, a charity trust storm has formed, and a round of discussion on charity system reform has arisen. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In an interview with a Nandu reporter in the same year, Guo Meimei said that before the incident happened, she &quot;didn&#39;t know much about charity&quot;. She only heard about &quot;godfather&quot; Wang Jun at a dinner in March and April. The name &quot;Commercial General Manager of the Red Cross Society of China&quot; was mentioned. One afternoon in April, Guo Meimei saw the Weibo posts of friends she followed. The certification information said president and general manager, “But I know there are a few people who are not. One of them, a classmate in our class, just took 100,000 yuan to register. A company name became CEO, so I simply changed it to &#39;Commercial General Manager of the Red Cross Society of China&#39;.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Guo Meimei once studied at a performance academy. She said that she particularly likes performing. I once had a dream about the industry. She also admitted to Nandu reporters that she has a desire to be famous. &quot;Everyone who studies acting or art doesn&#39;t want to be famous.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But after the &quot;Guo Meimei Incident&quot; happened, she cried and said that she would rather turn back time, hoping that she had not changed that certification and not used this &quot;I don&#39;t like this way of becoming famous.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She said that after thinking about it, she could understand why it caused an uproar, and she was particularly afraid of saying the wrong thing. She also felt sorry for the Red Cross and the people. In the interview, Guo Meimei also explained her definition of success to Nandu reporters: &quot;My ideal is to find someone who I love very much and who loves me very much, and do some business in a down-to-earth manner.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt; p>;At that time, Guo Meimei also talked about her dream of a happy life - &quot;Open a restaurant, jewelry store or something. Just live a happy life.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the other side, she But he stepped into the abyss of gambling and was imprisoned less than three years later. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 13 Sep 2023 23:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[被严重低估的流感]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256591]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-13 22:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Every year in autumn, as the temperature drops and the light decreases, while people enjoy the change of seasons, their bodies are exposed to Resistance to infectious diseases also decreases. Influenza, this familiar “old friend” will also arrive as scheduled. Most people don&#39;t think of the flu as a serious illness. The typical symptoms of a sore throat, runny nose, and muscle aches are often the same as a bad cold. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before the COVID-19 epidemic, influenza was the first infectious disease to be monitored globally by the World Health Organization (WHO). According to WHO statistics, seasonal influenza kills 290,000 to 650,000 people every year. Part of the reason why influenza is so destructive is that the virus mutates quickly, and people who have been infected with influenza viruses in the past cannot develop defenses against new viruses. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In our country, influenza is a seriously underestimated infectious disease. A large number of people are infected with influenza every year, and the health risks and disease burden it brings are far greater than imagined. A meta-analysis by scholars on the results of influenza epidemiological surveys conducted in different cities in my country in different years concluded that the annual number of influenza cases in China from 2011 to 2019 was approximately 84 million to 144 million. From the 2010-2011 to 2014-2015 epidemic seasons, there were an average of 88,000 excess deaths from influenza-related respiratory diseases in my country every year, of which 80% of the excess influenza-related deaths among the elderly over 60 years old accounted for the entire population. The risk of illness in children is about 1.5-3 times that of adults; pregnant women infected with influenza during pregnancy increase the risk of severe illness and stillbirth. A systematic review analyzed the economic burden caused by influenza in my country. Among them, outpatient cases in all age groups were 768-1,000 yuan/person, inpatient cases averaged 9,832 yuan/person, and direct medical care for children 5 years old and under and elderly people over 60 years old for inpatient cases. The cost is much higher than other groups. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Unlike many new infectious diseases, influenza scientists are already very familiar with it. The World Health Organization updates the antigenic components of influenza vaccines every year based on global surveillance and provides candidate strains for vaccine preparation. , for industry to develop the latest influenza vaccines. Although the mutation of new strains causes fluctuations in the effectiveness of influenza vaccines, vaccination is still the most cost-effective way to prevent influenza and complications. WHO recommends that countries set vaccination rate targets for recommended vaccination groups such as the elderly. 75%. In my country, the influenza vaccination rate is only 2%-4%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“The status of influenza vaccination in my country is very unsatisfactory.” Peng Zhibin, associate researcher at the Infectious Disease Management Division of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, disclosed at the 2022 National Vaccine and Health Conference that during the 2021~2022 influenza season, vaccines The vaccination rate was only 2.46%, a year-on-year decrease. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Because the vaccination rate is too low, the annual scrap rate of corporate influenza vaccines is as high as 20%-40%. How to improve the vaccination rate of influenza vaccine in my country and protect the public health has been a difficult problem that has long troubled public health researchers. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Three major factors&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Recently, the team of Professor Feng Luzhao, deputy dean of the School of Group Medicine and Public Health of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, conducted a study on influenza vaccination in my country. The current situation and problems are summarized, and a series of strategic suggestions are put forward to promote influenza vaccination in my country. This article was published on September 12, 2023 as the output of the &quot;Vaccine Delivery Research Innovation Laboratory&quot; project at Duke Kunshan University . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What factors influence the low influenza vaccination rate? Professor Feng Luzhao’s research pointed out that three factors affect my country’s influenza vaccination rate:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First, vaccine hesitancy caused by cognitive misunderstandings about influenza viruses and influenza vaccines. The survey shows that &quot;thinking that you are in good health and do not need to get a flu vaccine&quot; and &quot;even if you get the flu will not cause serious consequences&quot; are the main reasons for people&#39;s flu vaccine hesitancy; more than 40% of public health personnel believe that the flu will not cause serious consequences. disease, 18% of public health workers and 45% of medical workers said they lacked confidence in answering questions about influenza vaccines. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Second, the cost is closely related to the influenza vaccination rate. In my country, the influenza vaccine is a non-immunization program vaccine and needs to be vaccinated at your own expense. In recent years, some provinces and cities have included influenza vaccines as local free services, which has greatly increased the vaccination rate in some areas. According to a survey by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, the vaccination rate of people in areas with free influenza vaccination can exceed 50%, and the medical insurance reimbursement policy can also increase the vaccination rate to a certain extent, while the vaccination rate of self-paying people is only 1.8%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Third, the current vaccination system does not match actual needs. It is the best time to vaccinate against influenza before the epidemic season. my country’s annual vaccination work is concentrated between September and December. At present, influenza vaccination services mainly rely on vaccination clinics of the children&#39;s immunization program. Most vaccination sites only provide influenza vaccination for 1-2 half days on working days, which is not suitable for the annual concentrated vaccination demand. From the perspective of vaccination services, demand exceeds supply and it is difficult to make appointments for vaccination services, resulting in poor accessibility and convenience. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Others&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The 1918 influenza pandemic struck with almost unimaginable intensity and speed - infecting one-third of the Earth&#39;s population One (about 500 million people). Since then, all countries have been actively establishing public health systems to prevent influenza and exploring effective promotion measures. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Getting people to take the initiative to get vaccinated is the top priority of public health actions in all countries. As of 2021, 65% of WHO member states (128 countries and regions) have included influenza vaccination for high-risk groups such as the elderly and medical staff in national immunization plans or public health projects. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Professor Feng Luzhao was a member of the WHO Advisory Committee on Immunization (SAGE) Influenza Vaccine Working Group and currently serves as an expert on the WHO New Influenza Vaccine Comprehensive Value Assessment Advisory Group. He studied influenza vaccination promotion strategies in many countries and found that many countries have rich experience in policy advocacy, improving vaccination accessibility, motivating vaccination service providers, and monitoring influenza vaccination behaviors and social drivers. The successful experience of the intervention measures effectively increased the influenza vaccination rate. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Research found that many countries have included influenza vaccines in national immunization plans or introduced compulsory vaccination strategies. For example, in order to reduce the risk of infection among medical workers and patients, the health administration departments of the United States and Canada require medical workers and nursing home staff to receive influenza vaccines compulsorily. Secondly, we should vigorously increase the number and convenience of vaccination service points. In North America and European countries, influenza vaccination points have covered pharmacies, supermarkets, private clinics, hospitals and other places. Implementing incentive policies for service providers is also an effective means. The United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, etc. use the influenza vaccination rate of key groups as a performance evaluation indicator for medical personnel. The United Kingdom provides general practitioners with influenza-related educational materials and implements a performance incentive strategy to encourage medical staff to achieve the established influenza vaccination rate target and provide financial or material incentives to promote medical staff to vaccinate and recommend influenza vaccines. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, some innovative incentives can also increase the willingness of medical staff to be vaccinated. In 2017, institutions such as Birmingham Children&#39;s Hospital in the UK implemented a vaccination campaign. When a medical staff completed the influenza vaccination, Medical institutions will donate 10 tetanus vaccines to children or mothers in developing countries through UNICEF. This measure has enabled the influenza vaccination rate of medical staff in these institutions to reach 95.7%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Regarding the procurement challenges caused by the uncertainty of demand for influenza vaccines and the diversity of strains, the &quot;Vaccine Delivery Research Innovation Laboratory&quot; once summarized the experience of developed countries and found that through quantity commitments during the procurement process, etc. The method of linking quantity and price is often conducive to lowering prices. For example, the UK allows manufacturers to give different quotations based on different purchase quantities during the bidding process (often the larger the purchase quantity, the lower the price), thereby effectively utilizing economies of scale and reducing manufacturer risks. The Canadian government will require each province or region to estimate its demand before awarding contracts to manufacturers, and require each province or region to purchase at least 75% of its estimated amount, thus forming a quantity guarantee for manufacturers. At the same time, the government uses long-term contracts to reduce manufacturers&#39; risks, lower the price of vaccine procurement and increase the stability of vaccine supply. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For the public, extensive scientific and educational propaganda is also indispensable. The status of influenza vaccination in 15 European countries reminds that government departments&#39; monitoring of influenza vaccination rates and sending text message reminders for free vaccination are important factors in promoting vaccination among target groups. The United States, through media propaganda, not only increased the influenza vaccination rate among the elderly by 8%, but also advanced the vaccination time by 1.8-4.1 days. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These state-led measures have achieved remarkable results. Taking the elderly as an example, Brazil’s vaccination rate is as high as 89%; the UK’s vaccination rate for people over 65 years old has remained above 70% since 2004; the United States has maintained a vaccination rate of more than 70% for many years. Maintained above 60%; Canada, Spain, and New Zealand are about 60%-70%, and France, Australia, and Japan are about 50%-60%. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Strategic Recommendations&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Influenza vaccination can significantly reduce the risk of influenza and complications, and effectively reduce the number of outpatient and emergency visits, hospitalizations and deaths from influenza-related diseases. , the cost-effectiveness is very obvious. Since 2020, scientists have monitored and found that influenza and the new coronavirus are showing an alternating epidemic trend. Multiple studies have confirmed that co-infection with the new coronavirus and influenza virus will increase the risk of hospitalization and complicate the patient&#39;s condition. For years, scientists have emphasized the importance of influenza vaccination, but increasing vaccination rates remains difficult. In response to the low influenza vaccination rate in my country, Professor Feng Luzhao&#39;s team put forward the following strategic suggestions for policy makers to refer to:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Vaccine hesitancy has left many groups who should have received influenza vaccines in a &quot;streaking&quot; state. &quot;Health education should identify effective ways to target the public&#39;s misunderstandings about influenza and vaccines, especially for the elderly, primary and secondary school students and other groups covered by free programs, study the influencing factors of vaccination and effective intervention measures, and carry out precise publicity and science popularization .&quot; In the view of Professor Feng Luzhao, all localities should actively improve the public&#39;s understanding of influenza and enhance vaccine confidence. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For key groups, the study recommends gradually promoting free influenza vaccination for the elderly, primary and secondary school students, medical staff, etc., and striving to include influenza vaccination within the payment scope of basic medical insurance. They also encourage medical institutions at all levels to set up adult vaccination clinics, continuously strengthen the public health and prevention responsibilities of medical staff through continuing education, vocational training, etc., explore the right of medical staff to prescribe vaccines, and incorporate vaccination work into the evaluation system of medical institutions. Increase the enthusiasm of medical staff in recommending influenza vaccination. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, in view of the high scrap rate of influenza vaccines every year, we can learn from international experience and sign long-term (such as not less than five years) contracts for influenza vaccines with enterprises, purchase in quantities, and ensure supply based on quantities. , not only can share market risks, but also ensure the stable growth of enterprise production capacity. Avoid the situation of annual production and large amounts of scrapping. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;People don’t know when we will encounter another influenza pandemic, but it cannot be ruled out that it will happen again. As the WHO says: At the heart of an effective pandemic response is a strong, well-resourced health system. These include well-trained health workers; effective water, sanitation and hygiene systems; quality rapid diagnostic laboratory services; access to medical products, including vaccines; and reliable systems for tracking and reporting disease cases. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In August 2023, the US Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) updated the 2023-2024 influenza vaccine ingredient changes and vaccination recommendations, reminding the public that it is best to get vaccinated in September or October. In China, the 2023-2024 batch of influenza vaccines have arrived in various places and are open for reservation. According to the CDC surveillance data, the positive rate of influenza virus testing in some southern provinces has been rising slightly since the end of July. For individuals, facing the seasonal epidemic of influenza, proactive protection and vaccination to minimize the harm of the virus are practical choices. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 13 Sep 2023 22:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[店员控住偷窃女子：这不是执法权而是公民扭送权丨快评]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256574]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-13 21:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Recently, a netizen shot and uploaded a video:&amp;nbsp;On September 7, in Joy City, Xidan, Beijing, A woman was caught shoplifting in a cosmetics store. Two men (presumably both clerks) grabbed her arms and controlled her. The woman struggled hard and tried to escape and shouted &quot;Help&quot;. When a man called the police as if to call the police, the woman Once she broke away, the second man immediately hugged the woman&#39;s waist. At this time, an aunt who was watching stood up and asked, and the second man replied &quot;thief&quot;. The aunt yelled, &quot;Thieves are human beings too.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On social media platforms, many netizens believe that store clerks or security guards have the right to catch thieves, but aunts are not alone. There are also voices on the Internet that &quot;security guards or store clerks have no law enforcement power and have no right to restrict women&#39;s personal freedom.&quot; For example, some netizens said: &quot;Auntie is right. Although thieves are hateful, these two men are not law enforcement officers. There should be boundaries in their behavior. The behavior seen so far can easily cross the boundary and get themselves into trouble.&quot; This is a very representative point of view, so it deserves analysis. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First of all, it is correct that only law enforcement officers authorized by law have the power to enforce the law, but it does not mean that ordinary people have no right to defend their natural rights such as life, property and freedom. Going back to the above case, if these two men are the owners of the store, they are blameless in protecting their property; if they are not the owners, as employees (clerks or security guards) of the store and shopping mall, their duty is to protect the store. Or the goods in the shopping mall are protected from theft, which means that the owner of the goods authorizes them to protect the safety of the property. The cosmetics sold in such stores in shopping malls are generally expensive. If the store staff neglects to take precautions and protection, or just sit back and do nothing when they see someone stealing goods, then they will not only be derelict in their responsibility, but may also be required to bear the cost of the goods. loss. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some people may say that if you see someone stealing cosmetics, just let them keep the cosmetics and then let them go. Why not forgive them? If you do this in a single incident, it seems that the store or shopping mall has no losses, but it undoubtedly creates an incentive: if you steal something from this store or shopping mall, as long as you are not caught, it is yours; if you are caught, it will only be yours. By leaving something behind, the individual can escape unscathed. The mathematical expected value of stealing is positive, which means that the thief is called &quot;foolish, rich, come quickly&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Secondly, store clerks, security guards or ordinary passers-by can control existing thieves, restrict their personal freedom, and either call the police and wait for the police to deal with them, or transfer them to the police. This is not the so-called &quot;law enforcement power&quot; , but the right of citizens to transfer. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Article 84 of the current Criminal Procedure Law stipulates: Any citizen may immediately transfer a person to the public security organ, the People’s Procuratorate or the People’s Court for handling under the following circumstances: (1) While committing a crime or immediately after committing a crime Being discovered; (2) being wanted; (3) escaping from prison; (4) being hunted. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Obviously, if the above-mentioned woman stole valuable cosmetics, she might fall into the first situation. Article 264 of the Criminal Law stipulates that whoever steals public or private property in a relatively large amount, or commits multiple thefts, burglaries, thefts with weapons, or pickpockets shall be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of not more than three years, criminal detention, or surveillance, and shall also or solely be fined... …The &quot;Interpretation of Several Issues Concerning the Application of Laws in Handling Criminal Cases of Theft&quot; stipulates that theft of public and private property worth more than 1,000 yuan to 3,000 yuan shall be deemed as a &quot;large amount&quot; as stipulated in Article 264 of the Criminal Law, and also That is to say, the threshold for imprisonment is one thousand yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the case where the above-mentioned woman was caught stealing and suspected of a criminal offence, anyone can exercise the citizen&#39;s right to surrender. During the implementation process, the woman&#39;s personal freedom and freedom of movement will inevitably be restricted, which is also the proper meaning of the citizen&#39;s right to transfer. If a woman &quot;voluntarily&quot; goes to the public security organ or waits for the police to come to her door under the supervision and escort of everyone, the two clerks can certainly behave in a more polite manner, but no matter how &quot;gentle&quot; the clerk&#39;s behavior is, it is based on the fact that the woman&#39;s personal freedom has been temporarily suspended. on the basis of restrictions. A woman is more &quot;gentle&quot; if she cooperates with the clerk, and less &quot;gentle&quot; if she doesn&#39;t cooperate with the clerk. In the final analysis, there is a certain reciprocal relationship between the actions of both parties. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Finally, a store or shopping mall has the right to formulate and implement rules within its property scope, which is a manifestation of property rights. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, if the zoo requires visitors not to feed the animals, otherwise they may be asked out on the spot and blacklisted for refusing transactions. Shops or shopping malls require customers not to make loud noises or cause trouble and disrupt the peaceful shopping environment. Do not listen to the advice. You may be asked to leave. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These situations also inevitably involve restrictions on customers’ freedom of movement or forced eviction, but this is not a “law enforcement power” but a manifestation of “property rights” because businesses only restrict “their freedom of movement”. The freedom of movement of customers who break the rules &quot;within the property&quot;, that is, refusing such customers to continue to stay &quot;within the property&quot; is like saying to someone who is causing trouble in your home, &quot;Please leave, you are not welcome in my home.&quot; . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In short, businesses that restrict the personal freedom of criminals currently in the store or hand them over to the police for processing, or expel unwelcome customers are not exercising the so-called &quot;law enforcement power.&quot;执法权往往涉及限制人身自由与行动自由，但限制别人的人身自由与行动自由，有可能是执法人员在行使“执法权”，也有可能是良民在行使正当的私权，还有可能是歹人在实施犯罪，正如这篇文章所论证的，我们要明白行使正当私权与实施犯罪之间的本质区别，不能把制止犯罪等同于实施犯罪。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 13 Sep 2023 21:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[4000万中央资金建3个民生项目，竟全烂尾]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256566]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-13 20:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;video id=&quot;contents-video-0&quot; data-fileid=&quot;5576678021071762841&quot; data-media=&quot; video&quot; data-resource=&quot;tencent&quot; data-filename=&quot;Focus Interview丨Why did three people&#39;s livelihood projects involving more than 40 million yuan of central funds all come to nothing?.mp4&quot; data-cover=&quot;&quot; data-url=&quot;http: //1251434507.vod2.myqcloud.com/93ffc8dfvodgzp1251434507/9d66c4e85576678021071762841/fz8j2DawytoA.mp4&quot; poster=&quot;&quot; controls=&quot;controls&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;360&quot;>; &lt;source src=&quot;http://12514345 07.vod2 .myqcloud.com/93ffc8dfvodgzp1251434507/9d66c4e85576678021071762841/fz8j2DawytoA.mp4&quot; type=&quot;video/mp4&quot;>;&lt;/video>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In recent years, in order to promote the development of local economic and social undertakings, the central finance department will Certain investment fund subsidies will be provided to qualified local government investment projects and enterprise investment projects, covering areas such as affordable housing construction, pollution control, energy conservation and carbon reduction. These funds have played a positive role in promoting local construction. However, during an interview in Changyuan City, Henan Province not long ago, the reporter learned that some local affordable housing supporting projects invested by the central government have become decorations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the contents of the &quot;2016 Central Budgetary Investment Plan for the Construction of Supporting Infrastructure for Indemnified Housing Projects in Henan Province&quot;, the projects included in Changyuan, Henan Province at that time included the Puguang community resettlement housing supporting project and the food company The three projects, including the resettlement housing supporting infrastructure project and the Weizhuang shantytown renovation project in Changyuan County, involve a total of more than 40 million yuan in central budget funds. Seven years have passed. How are these projects being implemented? Have they achieved the expected results? The reporter investigated these three projects. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/2c5c8dbf497985a7c577e0e7238c94c5.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;1920&quot; height=&quot;1080&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/2c5c8dbf497985a7c577e0e7238c94c5.png&quot; data-key=&quot;250499&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;We first came to Hepingli Community in Changyuan, where the supporting project of resettlement housing for food companies in the plan was implemented. According to the plan, three three-dimensional garages were built here using central funds as supporting facilities for the community. However, residents reported that the three-dimensional garage was indeed built, but it was not used at all. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/80800df64ecbf4c08126c36f5543cf27.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;1920&quot; height=&quot;1080&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/80800df64ecbf4c08126c36f5543cf27.png&quot; data-key=&quot;250497&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;When I walked into this garage, it was full of dust and flying catkins, and there were no signs of a car parked on the ground. Some places have been damaged, and the circuits have not even been officially connected, and some corners have even become places where garbage is piled. The three-dimensional garage is a mechanical equipment system that can store and store a large number of vehicles, which can solve the problem of insufficient parking spaces on the ground. The built three-dimensional garage is idle and abandoned. What is the reason behind this?

Even so, why is the garage still not put into use normally? The reporter&#39;s investigation revealed that the reason behind this is not unrelated to the poor project management of the relevant departments. According to the bidding plan issued by the Changyuan City Shantytown Renovation Office at the time, the bidding content not only included the construction of the three-dimensional garage, but also clearly included &quot;the training, trial operation and delivery of installation and commissioning personnel.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cms-emer-res.cctvnews.cctv.com/image/3003/upload/15a347e52fa44d4aabaac9abe3a47192.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 0.5; &quot; width=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;0&quot; data-src=&quot;https://cms-emer-res.cctvnews.cctv.com/image/3003/upload/15a347e52fa44d4aabaac9abe3a47192.png&quot; data-key=&quot;media-1694567076243 -8&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Not only have they not been put into use, in fact, these three garages have not even been completed at the most basic level.

What is going on? According to the plan, a road of about 560 meters will be built locally to connect two municipal roads from Weiba Road to Weishi Road. The central government has allocated a total of 17 million yuan in funds, and it is scheduled to be completed in 2017.

In accordance with the requirements of relevant documents, local development and reform departments and housing construction departments should take measures to strengthen dynamic supervision of project construction implementation, and projects that cannot be completed on time or fail to pass completion acceptance will be criticized through notices, withdrawn or deducted from the central budget Domestic investment and other measures shall be punished. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the reporter&#39;s interview, the local government rectified these problematic projects, and now garages, health rooms, etc. are gradually being put into use.

The audit report is called the annual &quot;economic check-up.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“On the new journey of building a strong country and rejuvenating the nation, auditing bears an important mission. It must be based on the positioning of economic supervision, focus on the main responsibilities and main businesses, and better play the unique role of auditing in promoting the party’s self-revolution. &quot;On May 23, 2023, Xi Jinping, General Secretary of the CPC Central Committee, President of the State, Chairman of the Central Military Commission, and Director of the Central Audit Commission, emphasized at the first meeting of the 20th Central Audit Committee. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The meeting pointed out that it is necessary to build a centralized, unified, comprehensive, authoritative and efficient audit supervision system, and omit the audit supervision rights of all localities, departments and units that manage the use of public funds, state-owned assets and state-owned resources. , without exception, forming a normalized and dynamic deterrent. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On June 26, the National Audit Office released the &quot;State Council&#39;s Audit Work Report on the Implementation of the Central Budget and Other Financial Revenues and Expenditures in 2022&quot; (hereinafter referred to as the &quot;State Council Audit Report&quot;). Starting from July 20, audit reports from various regions will be released one after another. As of September 10, only Xinjiang, Tibet, and Guizhou have not yet released. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The level of detail in audit reports varies from place to place. The audit reports of Henan, Inner Mongolia, and Sichuan have detailed data. When talking about the problems that occurred, Fujian&#39;s audit report only mentioned irregularities and did not specify the specific amounts. The same is true for the Shaanxi audit report. Most of the issues do not state the amount involved. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After Guangxi published the audit report on the government website, it removed the original text. &quot;A university has received a cumulative financial investment of 131 million yuan in scientific research funds, implemented 862 scientific research projects, and achieved 0 results transformation.&quot; In early August, the above content in the Guangxi audit report became a hot search on Weibo. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporters carefully read 28 audit reports and reported on the outstanding issues in the audit reports of Hebei, Henan, Guangxi, Hunan, Hubei, Sichuan, Inner Mongolia, Jilin, Chongqing and Shanghai (see Southern Weekend App&#39;s &quot;Interpretation of Provincial and Municipal Audit Reports&quot; special topic). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The financial problems presented in the audit reports of 28 regions also have common characteristics, including misappropriation of funds, large scale of temporary fiscal payments, idle special debts, illegal lending by city commercial banks and rural credit cooperatives, etc. How to find a solution is the key to the &quot;second half of the article&quot; in audit rectification. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;22&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Local areas involved in misappropriation of funds&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Among the 28 provinces that released audit reports, the same problem occurred in 22 places The problem - misappropriation of funds, including transfer payment funds, special debt funds, employment subsidies, project funds, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Two cities and four counties misappropriated 4.491 billion yuan of government special bond funds from 23 projects for real estate commercial development projects, other debt repayments, and other expenses.” Guangxi audit report wrote. Looking at the audit reports that have been published in various places, 4.491 billion is the highest misappropriation amount. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The misappropriation of funds includes the misappropriation of compulsory education funds. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Relevant agencies in Inner Mongolia audited 469 urban schools and 184 rural schools and found that 21 banner counties misappropriated 265 million yuan of compulsory education funds to make up for the funding gap in other projects; 42 banner counties 991 million yuan Funds for compulsory education are stagnant, resulting in projects such as improving school conditions being unable to be implemented or completed on schedule. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Insufficient funds will cause other problems. &quot;41 banner counties have borrowed 923 teachers on a long-term basis, and 74 primary and secondary schools in 16 banner counties have insufficient staff, and long-term temporary employment of substitute teachers.&quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Chongqing, which is more than a thousand kilometers away from Inner Mongolia, is facing Faced with the same problem, &quot;177 schools in 8 districts and counties illegally used 33.0776 million yuan per student in public funds, training funds, etc. for daily operations and other expenses.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The State Council’s audit report also disclosed the misappropriation of education funds: After an audit of urban and rural compulsory education subsidy funds, it was found that 16 provinces had misappropriated 2.524 billion yuan to balance budgets, repay debts, and issue benefits. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Based on the audit reports of various provinces, the main flow of misappropriated funds is daily expenses or filling a certain funding gap. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“19 units occupied 9.7214 million yuan in employment subsidy funds to make up for the lack of unit administrative funds and office building maintenance and other expenses.” The Hubei audit report stated. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many places also use false expenditures to obtain funds. The audit reports of 8 provinces mentioned &quot;false expenditures&quot;, with the largest amount involved being in Sichuan, with 4.832 billion yuan of fictitious expenditures in 4 cities and counties. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Two departments and three affiliated units falsely listed electricity expenses of 1.6293 million yuan.&quot; Heilongjiang audit report introduced. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The audit report of the State Council mentioned that 2 departments and 8 affiliated units obtained 80.7967 million yuan of funds through false expenditures and other methods, of which 4.7185 million yuan was used for food, drink, gifts, etc., or was misappropriated by individuals. . This reflects on one side that behind the false expenditures, there may be corruption issues. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Budget Law of the People&#39;s Republic of China&quot; issued in 2019 stipulates that governments at all levels and relevant departments and units shall be ordered to report any failure to include all government revenues and expenditures in the budget, or to falsely list revenues and expenditures. To make corrections, the directly responsible person in charge and other directly responsible personnel will be punished by demotion, dismissal, or expulsion in accordance with the law. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Hundreds of billions of temporary payments to be solved&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Among the problems found in the provincial audit reports, most of the problems involving the highest amounts are financial temporary payments. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporters found that the issue of temporary payments was mentioned in the audit reports of six provinces including Inner Mongolia and Hebei. Among them, the temporary payment balance in 5 provinces exceeds 10 billion. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Financial temporary payments are generally funds temporarily lent by the financial department to budget units. It is required that they should not be left on the books for a long time and should be cleared and settled in a timely manner. The Ministry of Finance stipulates that all localities must digest the fiscal temporary payments formed in 2018 and before by the end of 2023. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The State Council audit report shows that as of the end of 2022, the balance of temporary fiscal payments in 54 regions reached 148.139 billion yuan, an increase of 8.363 billion yuan over the previous year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Inner Mongolia audit report stated, “The balance of temporary payments in 4 cities reached 47.055 billion yuan at the end of 2021, and the progress of digesting the stock is slow. 2 cities at the same level and 8 banner counties (districts) have not completed the digestion progress. Task&quot;. Among the six provinces that have announced temporary payment issues, Inner Mongolia has the highest temporary payment balance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Ministry of Finance stipulates that the newly formed fiscal temporary payment balance after 2019 shall not exceed 5% of the sum of general public budget expenditures and government fund budget expenditures at the same level. Audit reports from Guangxi, Gansu, Inner Mongolia, and Hebei all revealed that some counties and cities failed to meet this requirement. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Guangxi audit report shows that as of the end of 2022, the cumulative balance of fiscal temporary payments newly formed after 2019 has exceeded the 5% control line in 10 cities and 54 counties. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Moreover, the provisional payments in Hubei and Guangxi have not decreased but increased. &quot;As of the end of 2022, the balance of temporary payments in 20 cities and counties reached 26.055 billion yuan, an increase of 1.386 billion yuan over the previous year.&quot; The Hubei audit report revealed that some were used for unbudgeted and over-budget expenditures. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the end of 2018, the Ministry of Finance issued the &quot;Notice on Strictly Regulating the Management of Temporary Payments of Local Finances&quot;, requiring the financial department not to lend to enterprises, nor to lend to enterprises through other budget units. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, illegal lending to enterprises still exists today. The Inner Mongolia audit report stated that “one city level and three banner districts illegally lent 4.585 billion yuan to enterprises.” The Hebei audit report also showed that four cities illegally lent 1.068 billion yuan to enterprises. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Excessive temporary payment balances will crowd out other funds for special purposes and normal treasury funds, creating a situation where &quot;the budget has targets, but the treasury has no cash.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“The gap between local revenue and expenditure is widening, and it is difficult to get back the money borrowed.” A financial bureau official in a coastal province told Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;2022 Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region Final Accounts Report at the Level&quot; released in July 2023 stated that it is necessary to establish a classified management mechanism for temporary payments, steadily digest the stock, strictly control the increment, and promote the maintenance of temporary payments at the grassroots level. Reasonable scale, gradually replenishing the occupied treasury funds, and ensuring within-budget expenditure needs. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Tens of billions of special bonds are idle&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;As an important means for the government to stimulate consumption and expand domestic demand, special bonds have become the focus of audit reports in various places . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;19 of the 28 provincial audit reports mentioned problems with special debt. Among them, 12 reports stated that special bonds were idle. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Local government special bonds, also known as &quot;special bonds&quot;, refer to bonds issued by provincial governments for public welfare projects with certain returns. For a long time, it has mainly invested in social basic investment fields. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If it is a general bond, it is mainly invested in non-profit public welfare projects, and the source of principal and interest repayment is general public budget revenue. In contrast, the repayment funds for special bonds are government fund income, special income and refinancing special bond funds, which are required to achieve a balance between project revenue and expenditure. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Audit reports in some regions revealed that some special bond funds have been idle for as long as a year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Jiangsu audit report stated that the audit agency randomly inspected 62 cities and counties and found that as of the end of 2022, the government special bond funds for 337 projects in 54 cities and counties had not been fully put into use, with a balance of 22.944 billion yuan. Among them, 9.123 billion yuan has a balance of more than one year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Provincial-level bond funds are 1.954 billion yuan, which have been idle for up to 247 days; 29 cities and counties including Nanyang have bond funds of 6.637 billion yuan, which have been idle for up to 300 days.&quot; Henan audit report revealed . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the special bonds are idle, in addition to the original investment goals being unable to be achieved, the local government also needs to pay interest on the funds. If the special debt remains on the books for one more day, it will incur a lot of additional costs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to data from the Ministry of Finance, the average interest rate of special bonds is slightly higher than that of general bonds. As of the end of July 2023, the average interest rate on local government bonds was 3.33%. Among them, general bonds 3.31% and special bonds 3.34%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Taking the Jiangsu audit report as an example, the special debt funds outstanding for more than one year are 9.123 billion yuan. Calculated based on the average interest rate of special bonds of 3.34%, approximately 305 million yuan in interest will be paid per year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What causes tens of billions of special bonds to remain idle? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Based on the audit reports from various places, it is mainly due to problems in the preliminary preparation stage. For example, Jilin admitted in its audit report that due to failure to obtain construction land procedures and other reasons, project preparations were insufficient and it was difficult to start construction on time. 22 projects in 7 cities and counties had 5.993 billion yuan of idle funds. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Jiangsu audit report states that special bonds are idle because of &quot;immature conditions for construction projects, lagging implementation progress, or advanced bond funding arrangements, etc.&quot; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wen Laicheng, a professor at the Central University of Finance and Economics, told Southern Weekend reporters that according to normal procedures, after the project completes all government approval procedures, it will then be reported to the provincial-level finance department to apply for the issuance of special bonds, and the funds will be available immediately. start. However, some local governments begin to declare special bonds when they go through the approval process, and the financial department sometimes agrees to issue them. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He explained that special bonds are government investment projects, and more than 20 government departments are involved in the review and approval. If one department disagrees, the project cannot start construction. Even if the special bond funds are in place, there is no way to use them and it is easy to become idle. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;City commercial banks&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;, &lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Rural Credit Cooperatives lending illegally&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In addition to paying close attention to issues in the financial field , the audit report also focuses on the chaos in the financial system. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Eight provincial audit reports mentioned that many city commercial banks and rural credit cooperatives have loopholes in risk management and compliance, compliance operations and other sectors. Among them, the largest amount involved was illegal lending. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past few years, the competent authorities have been tightening the space for regional commercial banks to lend in other places. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Commercial Bank Law of the People&#39;s Republic of China (Revised Draft)&quot; promulgated in 2020 requires that regional commercial banks such as urban commercial banks, rural commercial banks, village and town banks, etc., shall carry out banking operations in accordance with the law within the scope of their residence. Business activities shall not be carried out across regions without approval. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Hebei audit department found that eight city commercial banks issued loans in violation of regulations, including issuing loans to customers or related parties whose loans were overdue, and that different branches within a jurisdiction issued loans to the same borrower, violating regulations. The amount of loans involved is 40.6 billion yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Nine city commercial banks failed to strictly implement the &quot;three loan checks&quot; system, resulting in greater risks in 5.959 billion yuan of loan funds. &quot;Three Loan Inspections&quot; refers to pre-loan investigation, loan review, and post-loan inspection. This system enables banks to understand the operating conditions of borrowers, determine loan risks, and is also an important basis for subsequent accountability. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Jiangxi audit report disclosed that 32 rural commercial banks had lax &quot;three loan inspections&quot; and illegally granted loans of 2.502 billion yuan to borrowers who did not meet the conditions such as credit reporting. 29 rural commercial banks failed to effectively track and inspect the use of loan funds, and 4.79 billion yuan of credit funds were misappropriated. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to illegal lending, there are also problems in the risk management and control of many city commercial banks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; According to the Jiangxi audit report, 28 rural commercial banks concealed loan risks by adjusting loan classification results in violation of regulations and repaying loans with loans, underreporting non-performing loans by 2.552 billion yuan; 8 rural commercial banks expanded credit in violation of regulations and passed We disposed of 1.854 billion yuan of non-performing assets by issuing loans to third parties to assume debts and transferring loans; 23 rural commercial banks wrote off non-performing loans worth 1.626 billion yuan in violation of regulations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Liaoning audit department focused on investigating the operations of two urban commercial banks and found that &quot;the president and vice president positions of one bank have been vacant for a long time, and some senior managers have not been approved by the regulatory authorities.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Inner Mongolia audit report revealed a detail that 6 leading cadres of a certain county health commission, public security bureau and other government departments and 12 other public officials illegally took shares in 2 rural commercial banks, involving 3.2036 million yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Do a good job in the &quot;second half of the article&quot; on audit rectification&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The first meeting of the 20th Central Audit Committee emphasized that the &quot;second half of the article&quot; on audit rectification &quot;The first half of the article&quot; is equally important as the problems revealed by the audit and must be promoted in one piece. Supervision and promotion of audit rectification should be regarded as an important starting point for daily supervision, and audit results should be used as an important reference for cadre assessment, appointment and dismissal, rewards and punishments. Those who fail to make rectifications, make perfunctory rectifications, or make false rectifications must be seriously held accountable. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In December 2022, the official website of the Guizhou Provincial Audit Office released the &quot;Report on the Rectification of Problems Found in the 2021 Provincial Budget Implementation and Other Financial Revenue and Expenditure Audits.&quot; According to the report, in response to the problem of misappropriation of 1.764 billion yuan of ecological and environmental protection funds in 1 city and 10 counties, the relevant regions have cleaned up the misappropriated resources and environment funds, and 475 million yuan has been rectified through the return of the original channels. The remaining funds are planned to be gradually Return in place. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the audit reports of 18 provinces in 2023, there are special chapters to introduce the transfer of clues about disciplinary and illegal violations, or the preliminary rectification of problems found in the audit. According to the official website of the local audit office (bureau), about one year after the audit report is released, a special report will be released to focus on the rectification of problems found in the audit report. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Hainan audit report stated that in 2022, the Provincial Audit Office transferred a total of 28 clues to disciplinary and illegal issues, involving 82 people and 440 million yuan. As of June 2023, 7 cases have been settled, 21 cases are being handled, and 12 people have been dealt with. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The transfer matters manifested themselves as illegal decision-making by public officials and abuse of power for personal gain, etc., resulting in the loss and waste of state-owned funds, state-owned assets and state-owned resources, involving 11 cases, 72 people, and 125 million yuan. In addition, the problems of &quot;mutual collusion&quot; and &quot;internal and external collusion&quot; in the field of engineering construction are hidden and diverse, mainly involving illegal project bidding, illegal subcontracting, and bid rigging, involving 5 cases involving 3 people and 278 million yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The contradiction between fiscal revenue and expenditure has increased, and how to make up for the misappropriated funds has become a difficult problem in the audit and rectification process. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;An official working in the Audit Office of a southern province told Southern Weekend reporters that after the local government’s misappropriation of funds was discovered by the audit department, due to rectification requirements, all funds needed to be replenished. However, due to financial constraints, In some places, other funds have been misappropriated to repay the misappropriated funds. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;In the past five years, more than 440,000 units across the country have been audited, and more than 38,000 clues on major issues have been transferred to disciplinary inspection and supervision, judicial and other departments, involving more than 920 billion yuan and more than 51,000 people;

&lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;肇庆市高要二中小卖部，现由道诚百货经营，平均年租金十余万。&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（南方周末记者卫琳聪/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2023年9月9日，广西贺州市平桂区人民政府办公室发布一则通报，将对贺州第五高级中学小卖部经营权进行调查。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;此前，该校以224万元的价格，将校园小卖部2023年秋季学期至2024年春季学期的经营权承包给当地一家食品批发店，而这家店成立仅一个月，引发舆论关注。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这是半个月来因校园小卖部拍出高价第二次引发热议。8月22日，广东肇庆市怀集中学小卖部5年租金拍出943万余元，约合189万元/年。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“天价”小卖部也并非最近才有。早在2016年，广西南宁三中小卖部就因租金高达173万元/年被各大媒体报道。近两年，湖南邵阳等地也接连爆出年租金上百万的校园小卖部。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;南方周末记者调查发现，正是由于校园小卖部招标方式越来越公开透明，才令这门被人忽视的“大生意”受到前所未有的关注，而校内小卖部的稀缺性，是其拍出高价的根源。&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;“9&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;00&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;万元的大生意”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;2023年9月1日，怀集中学刚刚开学，一排排新生正在操场上列队军训。这所2011年成立的公办学校有8300多名学生，涵盖初中和高中。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;学校对面遍布各类餐饮店和便利店，麻辣烫、螺蛳粉、奶茶、流动小吃摊等花花绿绿的招牌挂满了一条街。中午放学时间，校门打开，穿蓝白校服的学生蜂拥而出，整条街瞬间热闹起来。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;尽管刚开学，但学校小卖部租金拍出高价的消息已经在学生和商户间传开。这家150平方米的小卖部开在校园内，现在是学生口中“900万元的大生意”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;周边商户告诉南方周末记者，怀集中学对面近百平方米的店铺，每月租金在2000元左右。校内小卖部租金折合月算，比校外这些店铺高出六倍多。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但对于校内这个租金水平，商户们并不感到惊讶。他们介绍，怀集中学实行半封闭式管理，不少学生住校，只有中午和下午几个小时外出时间，多数时候在校内消费，而校内只有一家小卖部。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“一个军训下来，一天不说多，光饮料就能卖五六百箱。”一位在校门口开奶茶店的老板说，他的小孩就在怀集中学读书，小卖部卖的商品价格要比校外贵5毛到1块。多位学生也向南方周末记者证实了这一点。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;张雪瑞和丈夫在肇庆经营一家食品行，给肇庆多所学校小卖部供货，已经做了十几年。她告诉南方周末记者，校外小卖部的毛利率一般为25%-30%，而校内小卖部可以达到40%，消费主力是住校生。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;她详细算了一笔账：怀集中学小卖部租金一年近两百万元，扣除人工、水电费等成本，小卖部每天营收3万左右才能保本。学校共有8300多名学生，如果有4000人住校，每人每天消费10元，单日营业额能达到4万元。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这家小卖部位于怀集中学西门附近。9月1日开学这天，小卖部正忙着进货，成堆的货物从门口停放的货车里卸下。店里已经摆好了9个货架和两排冰柜，除了零食、饮料，还卖文具和生活用品。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;怀集中学小卖部的中标公告，并未显示中标人信息。但小卖部的价格标签上都写着“都市通便利店”。都市通便利店隶属于深圳市都市通实业有限公司（下称都市通）。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;企查查显示，都市通曾中标深‬圳‬市‬第‬三‬高‬级‬中‬学、布‬吉‬高‬级‬中‬学、深‬圳‬市‬龙‬岗‬区‬第‬二‬职‬业‬技‬术‬学‬校等多所学校的采购项目，为其供应方便面、饮料等食品和文具、生活用品。‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;南方周末记者联系了都市通，接电话的工作人员确认，公司承包了怀集中学小卖部。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/EieJcZzvpJjOUPFb7duNAApp0YiZ326pTKjdib5L.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;

text-align: center;&quot;>;校内小卖部的消费主力是住校生。&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（南方周末记者卫琳聪/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;价高者得&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;被爆出高价租金的校园小卖部，多采取竞价方式招标，且价格上不封顶。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;怀集中学小卖部的招标公告和怀集县对此事的说明，均透露了当时竞争之激烈：34个人（含公司）进行了2274轮竞价，按照1000元的加价幅度，38万余元的挂牌价最后被抬高到超过943万，加价近24倍。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2021年5月10日，肇庆市高要区第二中学小卖部3年经营权以728万元成交，一年租金约243万元，比怀集中学小卖部还高。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;广东广播电视台的报道显示，该项目经过167次增价竞拍，最终由广东省成隆校园便利店连锁管理有限公司竞得，负责人姓许。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;许姓负责人在接受采访时表示，投标的时候没底，也不知道最终会去到那么高的价格。为了和对手竞争，他以3万元的加价幅度逐步抬高价格，“想着对方都能做，我们也能做，（最终成交价）只比对手多了3万元”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;凡是以竞价方式招租的小卖部，战况都很激烈。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;据《上游新闻》报道，2021年4月，湖南邵阳新宁县第二中学100平方米小卖部3年租金起拍价68万元，最终以320万元成交，约合107万元/年。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在一则背景为“新宁县第二中学小卖部门面经营权公开拍卖会”的视频中，竞拍者不断举牌加价，拍卖价格一路攀升。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;《法制晚报》报道，2016年广西南宁市第三中学172平方米小卖部年租金拍出173万元。一位参与竞拍的人士介绍，共8位竞价人参与竞争，使用电子竞拍器出价，以50万元底起拍，加价1次最低1万元，最终经过44轮竞价方才成交。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;不过，有些小卖部的高租金并不是一次性缴纳，大大降低了中标者的资金压力，也让投标者在竞标时可以大胆加价。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;如怀集中学小卖部承包合同中明确，租金按月计缴。5年930多万元的租金，每月缴纳约15.5万元。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;店内一位工作人员亦向南方周末记者表示，第一个月租金交了就可以开业。“十几二十万而已，你有钱也可以做这个生意。”&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;公开竞&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;价&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;实际上，近年来“天价”小卖部频频见诸报端，也和招投标流程逐步规范、公开有关。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;公立学校小卖部属于国有资产，租金收入应纳入政府非税收入管理。早在2004年，财政部就曾发布加强政府非税收入管理的通知，提出“要依法推行国有资源使用权招标、拍卖”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;此后各地开始逐步推进。高要区财政局一位工作人员向南方周末记者回忆，区里逐步规范小卖部招租是从2009年开始。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“2009年之后，校园小卖部招租要由财政局审批后进行招拍挂。此前只需学校向教育局报批，招拍挂流程也没有现在规范。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2016年南宁三中校办主任在接受《法制晚报》记者采访时表示，当时南宁市对校园进行规范化试点，将原本捆绑在一起的小卖部和食堂进行剥离，开始对小卖部公开招租。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在全国公共资源交易平台上，能检索到的校园小卖部招标公告大多出现在2020年之后。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;肇庆第一条公告出现在2021年，招标人是高要二中。上述高要区财政局工作人员介绍，校园小卖部招标工作归属资产管理股负责，这个部门正是当时成立的。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;不经过公开竞价的小卖部，有时则存在一些问题。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;如福建厦门第十中学官网显示，2014年8月31日至2017年7月31日，学校食堂和小卖部实行捆绑承包经营，由学校组织相关人员组成评标小组进行综合评标，择优中标。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;公告中特别说明，教职工配偶可参与投标，以帮助其就业。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;而小卖部承包中不透明招租、教职工亲属参与等方式，曾屡屡引发校园腐败。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2021年广西横州市纪委监委网站披露的一则案例显示，横州市石塘镇一所小学的校长在2006年至2014年间，将学校小卖部以每年8000元的价格承包给其妻子经营，2014年后租金上调至1万元/年，由其妻子继续租到2020年，租金远低于同类小学小卖部。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2006年至2020年，该小学小卖部均未向社会公开招标，也没有报经主管部门审核同意、报财政部门审批。涉事校长被查后受到留党察看二年、降低岗位等级处分。&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;新的矛盾&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;然而，公开竞价在增强招标透明性的同时，也产生了新的问题。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;外界的担忧在于，中标商家可能会通过提高商品售价，将租金成本转嫁到学生身上。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2021年小卖部拍出3年320万租金后，邵阳新宁二中一直面对这样的质疑。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一位曾负责此次招标的新宁县政府工作人员向南方周末记者透露，以往新宁县也采用公开竞标方式拍卖校园小卖部经营权，年租金大多二三十万元。2021年因为商家互相竞争，价格被炒得比较高，落选商家将此事爆料给媒体，进而引发了关注。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;随后新宁县叫停了此次招标，并对招标情况展开调查。调查结果并没有发现招标过程有违规之处，但政府担心商家在高租金压力下抬高商品价格，难以监管，最终决定关闭县里所有公立学校的校园小卖部。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“我们县主要是不能解决这个矛盾。如果以招拍挂把小卖部承包出去，（商家）利润和学生消费（权益）存在矛盾。如果不承包出去，学校不是商业机构，不能作为法人自己经营。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;同样因“天价”小卖部引发舆论关注的南宁三中，作出了同样的选择。一位总务处的工作人员告诉南方周末记者，学校已经好几年没有开设小卖部了。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;以728万拍得高要二中小卖部3年经营权后，承包商在实际经营过程中出现问题。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;据广东电视台《今日一线》栏目报道，该承包商经营不到半年就关门歇业。校方负责人接受采访时称，承包商2021年9月份向学校及教育局提出关门请求，表示经营亏损，无法持续。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;高要二中在小卖部租赁合同中明确要求，“小卖部经营的所有商品必须明码标价，商品价格不得高于市场价格”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;张雪瑞曾给该承包商供货，她告诉南方周末记者，截至关门歇业，对方还欠她16万元货款未付。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;张雪瑞展示了2021年丈夫对该承包商的微信催款记录，对方表示：“二中做三个多月，保证金24万亏掉，租金连装修，要亏掉六七十万，这六七十万欠供应商一大半，现在需结算完毕，股东们拿钱来付亏损，所以要点时间。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;实际上，对于在校内开设小卖部，有关部门一直有所管控。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2019年12月，教育部、市场监管总局等四部门联合印发《关于落实主体责任强化校园食品安全管理的指导意见》，要求非寄宿制中小学、幼儿园原则上不得在校内设置食品小卖部、超市，已经设置的，要逐步退出。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;高要区教育局一位工作人员向南方周末记者介绍，他们曾反复研讨过这份指导意见，认为意见并没有要求学校完全不能开设小卖部。目前高要区只在寄宿学校中开设小卖部，以满足学生需求。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;对政府而言，小卖部租金也是一笔财政收入。上述多地政府部门的工作人员均向南方周末记者表示，按照财政部对非税收入的管理规定，公立学校小卖部作为国有资产，其租金收入目前都统一上缴国库，按收支两条线进行管理。&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;综合评分&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;高要区没有对小卖部一关了之，为了解决部分寄宿学校实际需求与“天价”租金之间的矛盾，对招标方式进行了改革。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;上述高要区教育局工作人员表示，全区总共有七八十家公办学校，目前25家仍设有校内小卖部。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2022年3月，高要区将18家租约到期的校内小卖部进行打包，统一招租。评标方式也从“价高者得”变为“综合评分”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;全国公共资源交易平台发布的公告显示，这一整体招租项目5年租金挂牌价1062万元，最终以1221万元成交。平均一家小卖部年租金仅13.6万元，比高要二中之前的价格低两百多万元。中标人为佛山市活道投资有限公司（下称活道投资）。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;南方周末记者探访了其中一家校内小卖部，发现其挂上了广东省道诚百货有限公司（下称道诚百货）的营业执照。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2022年6月以来，道诚百货先后注册成立18家公司，地址分布在高要区打包招标小卖部的18家公立学校内。&lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;September 1973 On the 11th, in Santiago, the capital of Chile, at the presidential palace surrounded by coup soldiers, Chilean President Salvador Allende from the left-wing camp gave a radio speech expressing his determination to fight to the end. Later that day, the presidential palace was captured and Allende was killed in the line of duty. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“This coup opened one of the darkest chapters in Chilean history.” A report by Cuba’s Latin American News Agency commented. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;September 11 this year marks the 50th anniversary of the overthrow of the Allende government by a coup. Over the past half century, many historical studies and declassified archives have shown that the United States went to great lengths and used all means to prevent Allende from coming to power and overthrow the Allende government. This year also marks the 200th anniversary of the &quot;Monroe Doctrine&quot; proposed by the United States. For a long time, the United States has held hegemony, manipulated the rhetoric of &quot;democracy and freedom&quot;, and used coup intervention, economic sanctions and other means to cause deep suffering to Latin American countries and people. Nowadays, more and more Latin American countries and people are awakening, and their voices against US hegemonic interference are rising day by day. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;a>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/4e16d2ae2dfe95e2b91054641f81e9fb.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity : 1;&quot; width=&quot;1000&quot; height=&quot;667&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/4e16d2ae2dfe95e2b91054641f81e9fb.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;250505&quot; >;&lt;/a>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span>;On September 11, 2022, in Santiago, the capital of Chile, a man held a red carnation in front of the memorial The 49th anniversary of the death of President Allende. (&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;Xinhua News Agency, photo by Jorge Villegas)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;The only chance of success is to launch a military coup&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot; strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&quot;It is clear that any form of political or constitutional approach to preventing the Allende government from exercising power is unlikely to succeed. The only chance of success is before or after Allende takes power. Immediately launch a military coup... It is hoped that the intelligence station will establish direct contact with as many influential military figures as possible.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On September 9, 1970, the CIA sent a secret cable to its intelligence station in Chile. Earlier, voting in the Chilean presidential election had just concluded. Allende, the candidate of the Popular Unity Front of the left-wing political party alliance, came first in the vote, which made the US government very angry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The US government’s suppression of Allende can be traced back to 1964. This year, Allende, who was defeated in the previous Chilean presidential election, ran again. At that time, the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union was raging, and the U.S. government, which regarded Latin America as its &quot;backyard,&quot; did not want to see this left-wing leader elected as the president of Chile. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As a result, the United States secretly supported Allende’s campaign opponents, provided millions of dollars in campaign funds to the parties of Allende’s opponents, and funded Chilean right-wing groups and media through the CIA to publish a large number of attacks and discredit Allende. Germany&#39;s message encourages people not to vote for him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The U.S. intervention achieved what it wanted, and Allende lost the 1964 presidential election. These behind-the-scenes manipulations obviously go against the &quot;democracy&quot; rhetoric that the United States has always promoted, but the absurd reason given by American politicians is that the damage caused by US intervention to Chile is less than the harm that a left-wing government that came to power through democratic elections might cause. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On September 4, 1970, Chile held a presidential election. Allende, who ran again, came first in the vote, but did not get more than half of the votes. According to the law, Congress must vote for the president among the top two candidates. Seeing that a &quot;second Cuba&quot; was about to emerge in Latin America, the panicked U.S. government decided to step up its intervention efforts to prevent Allende from winning the congressional vote. On September 15, then US President Richard Nixon issued instructions to CIA Director Richard Helms and others: &quot;Don&#39;t consider the risks, don&#39;t involve the embassy, ​​US$10 million in available funds, and more if necessary.&quot; Work day and night, select our best people... Let Chile&#39;s economy scream in pain, and come up with an action plan within 48 hours.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The plan the CIA came up with was to stage a military coup in Chile. Documents later declassified by the CIA showed that the United States promised some Chilean military officers that if they launched a coup, the United States would provide any assistance other than direct troops. The then commander of the Chilean Army, Rene Schneider, firmly opposed the coup and therefore became a &quot;thorn in the side&quot; of the CIA. On October 22, 1970, he was attacked by a gang associated with the CIA and died a few days later. The U.S. move was self-defeating and shocked the entire country of Chile, raising voices against foreign interference. In the congressional vote held on October 24, Allende won by a clear advantage and was elected President of Chile. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;a>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/5c180aa6ab63290afe289dd730c92787.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity : 1;&quot; width=&quot;1000&quot; height=&quot;667&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/5c180aa6ab63290afe289dd730c92787.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;250504&quot; >;&lt;/a>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span>;On September 11, 2022, people gathered in Santiago, the capital of Chile, to commemorate former President Allende 49th anniversary of the death. (&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;Xinhua News Agency, photo by Jorge Villegas)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;“Anyone who affects the interests of the United States will automatically become its enemy”&lt; /strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;As a major Latin American country, Chile’s political changes are one of the important trends in regional politics. The United States was afraid that Allende&#39;s model of coming to power through democratic elections would spread, lead to the rise of a left-wing wave in Latin America, and challenge the hegemony of the United States in Latin America. Therefore, after the failure of its first attempt to instigate a coup in 1970, the United States decided to focus on politics, economy, and military. All parties worked together to weaken the Allende government and create conditions for promoting a coup in Chile. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the political level, according to the New York Times, the US government allocated US$815,000 to create divisions among various parties within the Allende government. Between 1970 and 1973, the CIA spent a total of more than $8 million in Chile, most of which was used to fund strikes, demonstrations and other activities organized by right-wing opposition groups. At the same time, the CIA&#39;s &quot;black propaganda machine&quot;, which had been honed in the 1964 Chilean elections, was operating at high speed. Information collected by Chilean journalist Victor Herrero shows that between September 15 and November 3, 1973 alone, the CIA published 726 slanderous articles through various channels in Chile and abroad, accusing Allende of wanting to The media exerts control. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the economic level, in order to combat the Chilean economy, the U.S. government on the one hand prevents international financial institutions such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund from providing loans to Chile; on the other hand, it suppresses copper prices in the international market and attacks the export of copper products. This is an important source of foreign exchange for Chile. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the military level, the &quot;Chilean Secret Operations 1963-1973&quot; report released by the US government shows that the United States continues to provide assistance to the Chilean military, maintains high arms sales to Chile, and trains a large number of Chilean military officers. , to cultivate pro-American forces within the Chilean military. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Under the influence of a series of sabotage and suppression measures by the United States, by the eve of the 1973 coup, the Allende government was in trouble: there were serious divisions within the government, domestic prices were soaring, protests were frequent, and the military was becoming increasingly divided. Hair is unstable. Finally, on September 11 of that year, Augusto Pinochet, the then commander of the Chilean Army, launched a coup and overthrew the Allende government. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Without the support and financial assistance from the United States, the Chilean opposition would not be so strong.&quot; Chilean historian Victor Boulanghier told Xinhua News Agency. Chilean academic circles generally believe that US intervention created conditions for the Chilean army to launch a coup, leading to the collapse of the Allende government. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since then, the 17-year military rule has caused great harm to Chile. Chilean official data shows that during this period, more than 40,000 people were arrested for political reasons in Chile, more than 3,000 people died at the hands of the secret police or disappeared, and at least 200,000 people were forced into exile overseas. The United States cannot absolve itself of the blame for this. As an article in the British &quot;Guardian&quot; said: &quot;The hands of the United States are stained with the blood of Chileans.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Chilean Communist Party Representative Luis Cuello said that the United States&#39; intervention &quot;profoundly changed Chile.&quot; historical process, violates international law&#39;s protection of the rights of countries to choose their own political and social systems, and is a systematic violation of human rights.&quot; Former Chilean Senator Alejandro Navarro said: &quot;The United States has never cared about the democracy of the American people, but only cares about its own economic and political interests. The United States regards Chile and Latin American countries as its own &#39;property&#39;, Anyone who affects U.S. interests automatically becomes its enemy.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/69c4f486f25ac1460659c3de23a5090d.jpeg &quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1000&quot; height=&quot;667&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/69c4f486f25ac1460659c3de23a5090d .jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;250506&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span>;On September 11, 2021, people were in the Plaza de la Constitución in Santiago, the capital of Chile. rallied in front of the statue of former President Allende to commemorate the 48th anniversary of Allende&#39;s death. (&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;Published by Xinhua News Agency, photo by Jorge Villegas)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;The &quot;Monroe Doctrine&quot; is imperialist power politics&lt;/strong>; &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The tragedy of Allende fully exposed the hypocrisy and hegemony of the United States. The history of Latin America has proven that when the governments of some countries are not in line with the wishes of the United States, politicians in Washington will not hesitate to plan and instigate coups, and even go so far as to personally carry out butcher knives. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1915, turmoil broke out in Haiti. The United States sent troops to Haiti on the grounds of &quot;protecting expatriates&quot; and exercised full control over the country. It did not withdraw its troops until 1934. In the early 1950s, the Guatemalan government implemented land reform and distributed the idle land of the American-owned United Fruit Company to landless farmers. The U.S. government, with lobbying from the United Fruit Company, supported Castillo Armas in launching a coup to overthrow the government. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Various actions of the United States have aroused dissatisfaction in Latin America. In recent years, the will of Latin American countries to oppose U.S. hegemony has become stronger and stronger: In March 2022, the Panamanian government announced that December 20 will be designated as a &quot;National Day of Mourning&quot; to commemorate the victims of the U.S. military operation against Panama in 1989. ; During the Summit of the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States in January this year, participating leaders jointly urged the United States to end its long-term blockade on Cuba; in June, Nicaraguan President Ortega sent a letter to United Nations Secretary-General Guterres, demanding that the United States pay more than 120 US$100 million in compensation to fulfill the International Court of Justice&#39;s judgment on the United States&#39; funding of the Nicaraguan civil war in the 1980s. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In a recent interview with a reporter from Xinhua News Agency, Fernando Huanacuuni, the former Foreign Minister of Bolivia, pointed out that for the past 200 years, the United States has adhered to the &quot;Monroe Doctrine&quot; and regarded Latin America as its &quot;backyard&quot;, using hegemony and interference to These actions hinder the development of Latin American countries and seize resources in the region. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;The essence of the &#39;Monroe Doctrine&#39; is to interfere in Latin American countries and promote hegemony in Latin America,&quot; Vanakuni said. &quot;There have been countless examples of the United States blatantly interfering in the internal affairs of Latin American countries over the past 200 years. This is completely It is the power politics of imperialism, which is destined to fail because more and more countries want to independently determine their own democracy, economic model and national governance model.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 13 Sep 2023 17:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[打赏秀才的老年人，直播间里的情感供养]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256572]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-13 16:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/13/OvdWo957x5iBiGHa4n3ZmrxPa6RErMw0RrFaaeeJ.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;781&quot; height=&quot;625&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/OvdWo957x5iBiGHa4n3ZmrxPa6RErM w0RrFaaeeJ. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250514&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Behind the short videos are the emotions that the elderly cannot place. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lu Ermei, a female assembly line worker, once pinned her hopes for a counterattack in life on making short videos. superior. She tried documenting her life and singing lip-syncs, but she persisted for a long time but no one took notice. In the end, the most popular works were those that were &quot;co-produced&quot; with famous Internet celebrities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;When all romance returns to nature and tranquility reaches far away, will you grow old together with me?&quot; In a video pinned to the top by Lu Ermei, photos of her and Xiucai were combined. Together, they smiled and cuddled up to each other. Amidst the accompaniment of earthy love songs and the special effects of flying red hearts, this sincere &quot;vow&quot; was played on the screen. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It must be said that in addition to the purpose of operating a video account, the video also contains the admiration of the host and fans for the show. This video received more than 200 hearts and 39 comments, such as &quot;a perfect match&quot;, &quot;perfectly matched with the handsome guy&quot;, and &quot;may the scholar brother not grow old and stay with his sister until he grows old&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The price Lu Ermei paid for this was a reward of more than 100,000 yuan. &quot;There is a sister who gave a reward of more than 500,000 yuan, but she did not get it back.&quot; Before the scholar&#39;s accident, Lu Ermei regretted her lack of calmness and whims. &quot;Now that his account has been blocked, I will Very happy.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On September 2, 2023, the anchor Xiucai, who has tens of millions of fans and is known as the &quot;harvester of middle-aged and elderly women&quot;, had her short video account banned for violating the relevant regulations of the platform. Previously, the scholar&#39;s signature moves of pretending to be shy, lifting his hair, covering his mouth, and ogling, were imitated and parodied, and spread virally on major platforms. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The scholar’s ​​ban also exposed his “crazy fans” to the spotlight. Among Xiu Cai&#39;s fans, there are many &quot;true fans&quot; like Lu Ermei who reward hundreds of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of yuan. What kind of charm do these elderly emotional anchors have that can make fans donate generously? What are these middle-aged and elderly people who spend a lot of money really looking forward to? &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Induced &quot;reflux&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Lu Ermei&#39;s hometown is Huaining County, Anhui Province, and she works in a garment factory in Changshu City, Jiangsu Province. Because she is the second eldest child in the family and is called the second sister of the Lu family, she simply named her short video account &quot;The Second Sister of the Lu Family&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She has been a fan of Xiucai for three or four years. At the beginning, Xiucai only had 500,000 or 600,000 fans, but later it skyrocketed to tens of millions. &quot;He said he was going to teach me how to make videos and asked me to help him play PK.&quot; Lu Ermei recalled the initial exchanges between the two to Southern Weekend reporters. Because she gave gifts to the scholar, she got many opportunities to communicate with him and established initial trust. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to public information, Xiucai is a 39-year-old native of Mengcheng, Anhui Province. His family background was average. In his early years, he and his wife worked in Suzhou, and their children stayed in their hometown to attend boarding school. A few years ago, at the suggestion of a classmate, I started shooting short videos. At first, they were mainly about migrant workers, and gradually turned into anchors wearing suits and singing lip-sync. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Gradually, Lu Ermei came up with the idea of ​​making short videos. She posted the composite video with Xiucai on her account and accumulated some fans. However, the most direct way to get the opportunity to be exposed is to interact with the talents in the live broadcast room, and this requires buying gifts. From the most basic little hearts, gold chains, and hot air balloons to valuable Porsches and helicopters, Lu Ermei went all the way up, and she frequently received compliments from scholars: She is very beautiful, and she should listen to her brother, etc. wait. Xiucai also praised Ermei for doing a good job in her video and her fans were increasing quickly. Lu Ermei was very happy and replied, &quot;It&#39;s all because of you.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lu Ermei got Xiucai’s promise to help her create an account, but there were more and more requests for rewards. &quot;Just let me help him with PK, and ask me to help him in the live broadcast room.&quot; The so-called PK is a common form of popularity competition on live broadcast platforms. The anchors show off their talents or skills and call on their fans to give rewards. The method is &quot;upvote&quot;. Whoever gets the most rewards will be the winner of the PK competition. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the fierce competition, scholars frequently asked for rewards of &quot;carriage&quot; and &quot;Hua Zi&quot;. &quot;Hua Zi&quot; is the common name for the gift &quot;Carnival&quot;, which is equivalent to RMB 3,000. The most recent reward was more than 4,000 yuan from Lu Ermei during a live broadcast. Over the past few years, she claimed to have consumed more than 100,000 yuan in savings. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“It is a relatively common form to create an account and lead an apprentice.” Liangzhou (screen name) is a knowledge-based blogger on social platforms. She used to be responsible for the virtual anchor business in an MCN company. As a short-term An in-depth user and long-term observer of the video platform, she attracted attention for her series of blog posts analyzing the phenomenon of &quot;scholars&quot;. She told Southern Weekend reporters that this method of promising to teach people how to create an account in order to ask for rewards is deceptive and misleading to a certain extent. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liangzhou analyzed that in addition to the form of &quot;teaching how to create an account&quot;, the more direct way of inducement is to &quot;fight backflow&quot;: &quot;It is to act as a support to increase the popularity of the live broadcast room.&quot; The so-called fighting Returning means that the anchor and the fans agree in advance that the fans will help buy gifts in the live broadcast room to increase their popularity, and the anchor will refund the amount they spent in private. However, because the platform will take half of the water, the cost of returning it is very high, and because it involves data fraud, the platform does not encourage or even prohibit this behavior. Therefore, reshoring is usually an operation used by MCN organizations to recruit new talents. Personal promises to fight back are often suspected of inducement and deception. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to media reports, a 62-year-old woman from Beijing said that she rewarded scholars with more than 520,000 yuan in the form of gifts. She said that the reason for being so generous was that the scholar promised her that he would not treat her badly and would return the money, but the promise was never fulfilled. In the past three years, she has been asking Xiucai for the 520,000 yuan, but only 17,000 yuan was recovered. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;He is such a ruthless thing&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;However, Lu Ermei&#39;s short video account has not been launched, and the number of fans has remained at more than 10,000 , she did not have the financial resources to continue to reward, so the scholar stopped talking to her in the live broadcast room. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;He said he voluntarily swiped gifts, and it&#39;s impossible for others to use my mobile phone to swipe it, right?&quot; In 2021, Lu Ermei went to Mengcheng, Anhui to find a scholar to discuss the theory, but was scolded by the other party. Later, He was also blocked by the other party, saying, &quot;He is such a heartless and meaningless thing.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although there are mixed ideas of making a short video account, in the minds of fans, the most attractive reason is the emotional value provided by the anchor, but this value requires money to support. &quot;This type of anchor actually has poor ability to &#39;organize&#39;.&quot; Liang Zhou analyzed that in order to attract fans, many live broadcast rooms will set up studios with lighting, props and furnishings, and have rich talent displays, and some will even design scripts. , relatively speaking, there will be much less emotional live broadcast routines for the elderly. &quot;Old people don&#39;t like to be noisy, what they need is companionship.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/UXZYTnTr7JHSV5qkyvCfGgwpNodqtpXVV7xWen9D.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height= &quot;452&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/UXZYTnTr7JHSV5qkyvCfGgwpNodqtpXVV7xWen9D.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250515&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The classic shy expression of a scholar. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Internet screenshots/pictures)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liangzhou registered a new account and deliberately liked and collected videos of senior citizens to feed the account&#39;s popularity &quot;Habit&quot; opens up a new world. For the first time in the homepage recommendation, she came across a live broadcast room where the elderly were grouped together. The users who were connected were all men in their sixties. They also played PK. The audience could designate the anchor among them to &quot;open the arena&quot;. Then vote for them separately. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, there was no talent show in this PK, only voice chatting with fans, mostly middle-aged and elderly women. Liangzhou judged from the chat content that the two were familiar with each other and it was not the first time they were on the mic. The anchor used instant messaging software to call fans to come over and help &quot;vote.&quot; The content of the chat is also very common: What kind of tea did you drink today? Is the road easy to walk or not? If it rains, don&#39;t go out because your shoes will get muddy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;These words must not be heard by her at home.&quot; Liang Zhou said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Judging from the video and comments, the anchor ran a business when he was young and was considered a prominent figure in their local village. However, although he is much older than Xiucai, his video style is similar, with fixed scenes and fixed music, and he is usually holding a purple clay pot and making tea. The uncle’s account only has 10,000 to 20,000 fans, but the interaction volume is very high. Each video has thousands of likes, and the number of comments is close to half or one-third of the likes. Through this PK, the anchor got more than 6,000 votes, which were converted into money and he could get 300 yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xiucai first came out of the industry because in May 2023, a 70-year-old woman took a train alone to Mengcheng, Anhui Province to seek an offline meeting. Sister Zhang was a classmate of the scholar and had been a short video partner for a period of time. She claimed that her relationship with the scholar later deteriorated because she discovered that the scholar promised to meet his fans in private as an inducement and asked fans to give him large gifts. Sister Zhang believes that this breaks the moral bottom line and is not a very honorable thing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sister Zhang considers herself to be the leader of short videos made by scholars, and she felt ashamed to see such a situation. In July 2023, she began to publicly solicit victims who were &quot;deceived&quot; by scholars on the short video platform. . A girl in her twenties asked for help. Her parents had divorced. After her mother fell in love with a scholar, she gave him a reward of more than 10,000 yuan and talked about going to find the scholar. She and her brother could not persuade her. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“It’s unclear whether the old lady in her seventies came here to give him a reward, but the fact that the old lady came to us is definitely related to them.” Sister Zhang told Nanfang a reporter said over the weekend. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Fans of Xiu Cai&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Liang Zhou also browsed the account of an active fan of the uncle anchor mentioned above. His character image is very clear: in his early career Yousheng is now widowed, her son is married and has settled in a big city, while she lives alone in her hometown. What is particularly impressive is that this woman has a strong desire to share. The most she posted was 33 videos in one day. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;She seems to have no one to talk to in real life.&quot; Liang Zhou said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“I support my grandma to watch short videos of scholars.” Xiao Xie is a post-90s generation who has been working for three years. She told a Southern Weekend reporter that her grandma is 68 years old and was in good health a few years ago. , I would also go to square dance. In 2022, I accidentally fell and fractured my bones. After recovery, I rarely went out and developed the habit of checking my mobile phone. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xiao Xie said that her grandfather had used a smartphone a few years ago and would hold it all day long. Grandpa and grandma seldom communicated with each other in daily life. After grandpa became addicted to using his mobile phone, the two of them talked less. Until grandma also used a smartphone, she gained a lot of emotional sustenance. The two elderly people often stay up until one or two o&#39;clock in the evening, &quot;you can say they are very obsessed with it.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, Xiao Xie found that her grandma’s ability to distinguish was very low. She used to like &quot;Fake Jin Dong&quot;, but she couldn&#39;t tell it was fake. Later, she liked Xiucai, and many video platforms gradually appeared. Even if you imitate or pretend to be a scholar’s ​​account, grandma won’t be able to tell whether it is genuine or fake. &quot;I can&#39;t tell whether it&#39;s a platform or an anchor, an organization or an individual, but she believes it anyway.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Every time she goes back, grandma will explain her views on mate selection and tell her granddaughter to look for a scholar. The ideal type of boy is not only good-looking, but also very capable, and at the same time considerate and caring. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Grandma also thought of giving rewards to scholars. Every time Xiao Xie goes back, she will clean up the phone memory for her grandparents and close some unreliable accounts. She discovered that her grandma’s mobile phone had received text messages indicating failure to reward and failure to bind bank cards. &quot;I&#39;m too old to do this.&quot; The two old people&#39;s mobile phones have never been bound to bank cards. The family realized that they would not waste any money, and as long as the elderly were happy, they could feel free to let them watch short videos. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Not only the elderly, short videos are also the spiritual sustenance of Lu Ermei. &quot;Working in the factory is too tiring, and I have to move my hands and feet.&quot; Lu Ermei and his wife met in a garment factory in Changshu, Jiangsu. They have been married for more than ten years. However, over the years, her husband has worked in Changshu, Suzhou and other places. Get together less and stay apart more. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Working in a garment factory is very boring and I only have 3 days off every month. Because of making accounts and giving rewards, her relationship with her husband had a serious crisis. Her husband went to Suzhou to work alone. The two had little contact and were basically in a cold war. &quot;He (husband) was suspicious and thought I was betraying him.&quot; &quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;Growing old does not mean giving up all needs&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&quot;The elderly&#39;s blind pursuit of stars is different from ours. We chase stars and buy a concert ticket. At least these things can be seen on the surface, they are internal (emotional needs).&quot; Sister Zhang said that in the spiritual world of many elderly people, emotions are relatively lacking, and their empty hearts cannot be comforted. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sister Zhang added that men usually die earlier than women, leaving the old lady alone; there are also cases where men go out to make money while women stay behind, and their emotional worlds are generally empty. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Before, I saw a post saying that when women reach a certain age, their secretion of hormones decreases and they lose sexual desire. This is definitely wrong.&quot; Liangzhou said that when a person enters old age, it seems that The concept of losing vitality in a social sense also means that the related lust and emotional needs should not appear in the elderly - this is obviously a very incorrect perception. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Companionship, humor, love, conversation and many other things are essential human needs. We want all these when we are young, but when we get older, age does not mean It means that we have given up all these needs. And society and the people around us should not directly ignore this series of needs. This is a manifestation of giving up basic responsibilities.&quot; Liang Zhou said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;In the process of scholars becoming popular, whether it is older women or middle-aged and elderly people, I think it is understandable to like scholars.&quot; Peng Huamao, a professor at the Institute of Developmental Psychology of Beijing Normal University, has been doing psychological cognition and training for the elderly for many years. According to the research, after observing some short videos and fan messages of scholars, she believed that these messages were a relatively flamboyant emotional expression and reflected the emotional needs of the elderly. “Many of these comments are about women’s desire for emotion. , or, in other words, the awakening of one’s own emotional needs within.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Peng Huamao analyzed that the emotional needs of this group rarely receive attention from the outside world, especially among middle-aged and elderly women. &quot;When you are young, you live for your family. When you get older, your value in the family is not reflected.&quot; She said that instead of exploring why scholars are popular, it is better to pay attention to the emotional needs of middle-aged and elderly people in real life. How to satisfy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Peng Huamao said that there is a common misunderstanding in society that love will weaken with age, which makes everyone ignore the psychology of the elderly. Excessive ridicule and stigmatization will cover up the underlying problem. &quot;So, I think whether you give a reward to a scholar or pay attention to a scholar, it actually expresses that she needs a spiritual sustenance.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 13 Sep 2023 16:25:05 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[华为苹果新机接连亮相，你多久会换一台手机？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256564]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-13 15:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;In the early morning of September 13th, Beijing time, the 2023 Apple Autumn Conference arrived as scheduled.
