(Photo by Southern Weekend reporter Chen Jiahui)&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;On July 23, 2023, Yi Yonghong decided to commit suicide. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;She placed the suicide note on the plastic stool at the head of the bed, and her purse and mobile phone, which she never left behind, were neatly placed beside the bed. The purse contained more than 3,000 yuan in cash. She locked the door and ignored the clothes in the washing machine. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&quot;I&#39;m leaving. I don&#39;t know what to do to make you less hurt...I don&#39;t ask for your forgiveness. I just hope that you will live a happy life and forget that I am a bad wife and mother.&quot; .&quot; She said in her suicide note. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;To commit suicide, she chose a mile away. She had to pass through a large guava field. The unripe fruits wrapped in white plastic bags were hung all over the orchard. They were the fruits of her summer. The guava tree is not high, so you have to bend down when walking through it, and you have to cross a drainage ditch in three to five steps. The last section of the road is a slope about two meters high. Climb up and you will reach the embankment. A wide pond with a wide water surface slowly unfolds in front of you. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The embankment is covered with mimosa, lush and green. The pair of pink slippers were neatly placed on the steps by Yi Yonghong, with the toes facing the pond. A few hours later, her husband Cheng Shanzhi discovered her. She was wearing a red top and floating in a prone position in the middle of the pond. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Eight days before committing suicide, at the age of 44, she reported that she was raped by fruit vendor Huang Mouguan. The police decided not to file the case because the existing evidence could not prove that a crime had occurred. After committing suicide, the police decided to open a case for investigation on September 7 because &quot;new evidence was discovered.&quot; In order to prove that she was raped, she was preserved in an ice coffin and underwent a craniotomy and a thoracotomy for an autopsy. &lt;/p>;&lt;h4>;Misfortune in the banana fields&lt;/h4>;&lt;p>;Typhoon Taili is approaching. Before the violent storm arrived, Yi Yonghong had to cut down more than 20 acres of plantains at home. Nine years ago, this couple from Yongzhou, Hunan, planted fruits on a contracted land in Wenchang, Hainan. Now the contracted land covers nearly 50 acres, half of which is planted with bananas and the other half with guava. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Yi Yonghong’s WeChat chat records show that on the evening of July 14, she and Huang Mouguan finalized the time to harvest bananas the next day. Huang Mouguan opened a fruit wholesale stall near the busiest park in Wenchang, and would go to fruit farmers&#39; homes to buy fruit. In the Wenchang area, most of the fruit growers are outsiders who have crossed the Qiongzhou Strait to make a living, and most of the fruit vendors are Hainan locals. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Yi Yonghong rarely goes out in public to sell bananas, and spends most of her time working in the banana fields. In early 2023, Yi Yonghong&#39;s husband Cheng Shanzhi started doing business with Huang Mouguan after being introduced by a fellow villager. By the time the incident occurred, he had sold bananas to him five times in total, with a transaction volume of 1,480 yuan. In the first two times, Cheng Shanzhi cut down plantains and traded them with Huang Mouguan. Because her husband&#39;s left ankle was seriously cut due to an accident, Yi Yonghong took over the job of cutting plantains for the next three times. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;It was these three experiences of selling bananas alone that pushed Yi Yonghong&#39;s life to a point of no return. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The banana land contracted by Yi Yonghong and his wife is not close to the village where she rents, and it takes half an hour by electric bicycle. In 2014, they built a shelter house using hollow bricks next to the plantain field. There was no other house within a radius of 200 meters. When we moved out in 2022, there was only a guard dog and a few free-range chickens left there. The unused old house began to fall into dust and became desolate. There was no longer a fire in the kitchen, and no one could sleep on the bed. Except for resting when working, Yi Yonghong rarely came here. The airtight trees almost swallowed up the small house. house. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;The old house at the crime scene.

(Photo by Southern Weekend reporter Chen Jiahui)&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;The first time Yi Yonghong took over for her husband who injured his foot and cut bananas alone with Huang Mouguan was on July 2. To cut bananas, vendors usually go to the fields to select the bananas, and the farmers carry them to the field, where they are finally weighed and loaded onto trucks. Yi Yonghong seems to particularly like pink. She has a short-sleeved shirt of this color, which she wears specially when working. Her right shoulder is covered with dark green glue marks from banana. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Yi Yonghong later told her husband that that time, Huang Mouguan took the opportunity to help her carry the banana on his shoulders and touched her breasts. He also said to her: &quot;Don&#39;t do such hard work, I will give you money.&quot; Yi Yonghong refused him: &quot;Don&#39;t say this, we are doing hard work to earn hard money, I am not that Plant people.&quot;&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;No more evidence can be obtained for what happened in the banana field. Other merchants next to Huang Mouguan&#39;s fruit shop said they had not seen him for more than a month after the incident. On the afternoon of September 2, Huang&#39;s wife was selling fruit at a stall next to the shop. She was emotional and refused to be interviewed: &quot;You don&#39;t know how much impact they have on our lives. I am under great pressure.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A week later, bananas had to be picked again, and Yi Yonghong and Huang Mouguan were once again surrounded by wild vegetation and deserted areas&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot; https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style= &quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 21 Sep 2023 17:55:03 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[古龙：人在江湖，身不由己丨那年今日]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257298]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-21 17:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 21 Sep 2023 17:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[交通运输部：中秋国庆假期小型客车免收通行费]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257286]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-21 16:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;span>;At 10 o&#39;clock today (September 21), the State Council Information Office held a press conference.

Among them, &quot;rumor information&quot; and &quot;leak information&quot; are relatively easy to understand, and the corresponding penalties include &quot;defamation&quot; and &quot;infringement of commercial secrets&quot;. In comparison, the definition of &quot;insulting information&quot; is much shorter: &quot;information that attacks and insults companies or entrepreneurs, spoofs portraits of entrepreneurs, maliciously associates with pornographic and vulgar topics, etc.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The original intention of the &quot;Guidelines for Reporting Enterprise-related Internet Infringement Information&quot; is to protect the legitimate rights and interests of enterprises and entrepreneurs, improve the efficiency of reporting enterprise-related infringement information, and maintain a good business environment. Among them, the formulation of &quot;spoofing entrepreneur portraits&quot; is more attention-grabbing and deserves in-depth analysis. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First of all, the basis for &quot;spoofing entrepreneur portraits&quot; is &quot;online infringement information&quot;, which originates from Article 1019 of the &quot;Civil Code of the People&#39;s Republic of China&quot;, &quot;No organization or individual may vilify or defame, Or use information technology means to forge and infringe on the portrait rights of others.&quot; According to this law, &quot;spoofs of entrepreneur portraits&quot; will constitute infringement if they are proven to be &quot;uglified&quot; or &quot;forged.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, spoofing portraits of entrepreneurs is not necessarily directly equivalent to &quot;vilification&quot; or &quot;forgery.&quot; For example, if an entrepreneur&#39;s portrait is turned into an emoticon or a cartoon character, it does not necessarily constitute &quot;uglification&quot; or &quot;forgery&quot;. Compared with &quot;attacking and abusing entrepreneurs&quot;, &quot;spoof portraits&quot; also have elements of ridicule and humor, and are often beautified and praised. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From the actual situation, most of the entrepreneurs spoofed by netizens are famous and successful entrepreneurs. They have strong industry influence and social popularity, and they are already public figures themselves. As public figures, entrepreneurs&#39; lives and work have attracted widespread attention, and their words and deeds are closely related to public interests. As a special group in society, the portraits of well-known entrepreneurs have become a piece of &quot;public knowledge&quot; well known to the public. As public figures, they also bear certain obligations of tolerance and bear certain derogation of interests in their portrait rights. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Therefore, it is necessary to refine the identification criteria to determine whether &quot;parody images of entrepreneurs&#39; portraits&quot; constitute &quot;insulting information&quot; and &quot;corporate-related infringement information.&quot; This leads to the second question: How will entrepreneurs protect their rights once faced with &quot;spoof portrait pictures&quot;? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In reality, complaints from public figures against netizens for “portrait rights infringement” are often concentrated in the entertainment industry. More than one entertainment star has been very angry about &quot;spoof portrait pictures&quot;, which has triggered many legal lawsuits. According to statistics from the &quot;Southern Metropolis Daily&quot; on April 18, 2023, the China Judgment Document Network disclosed 356 civil cases related to celebrities&#39; portrait rights in 2022. Among them, the proportion of celebrities winning the lawsuit is very high, &quot;Ge You complained about &#39;Ge You lying down&#39; &quot;It has an almost complete winning rate. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Comparatively speaking, entrepreneurs encounter spoof portraits. Almost no well-known entrepreneur can escape the &quot;spoof&quot; of netizens, such as Lei Jun&#39;s &quot;are you OK&quot; and Wang Jianlin&#39;s &quot; &quot;Don&#39;t worry about the hundreds of millions&quot;, Robin Li &quot;what&#39;s your problem&quot;, etc. However, the leading entrepreneurs who were pranked did not feel that this was an insult or infringement on themselves, and they did not take legal action. Not only that, some entrepreneurs will actively join in the spoof and use it as a marketing tool to get closer to consumers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for the alleged infringement liability of &quot;spoof portrait pictures&quot;, most of them belong to personality rights disputes, and the most serious cases point to the &quot;crime of insult&quot;. Article 246 of the Criminal Law of the People&#39;s Republic of China stipulates that the crime of insult refers to &quot;the use of violence or other methods to openly tarnish the reputation of others and the circumstances are serious.&quot; The crime of insult is a crime of circumstance. The perpetrator&#39;s behavior of openly insulting others must reach the level of &quot;serious circumstances&quot; to constitute a crime and be investigated. This crime falls under the category of &quot;no complaint, no action&quot;, that is, no action will be taken until a complaint is made, except for cases that seriously endanger social order and national interests. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If entrepreneurs themselves are spreading their own spoof portraits, emoticons and even ghost videos, it is naturally even less likely that the outside world will consider this to be an infringement of the entrepreneur. Therefore, as long as the entrepreneur himself does not feel dissatisfied, similar behavior should be tolerated. If an entrepreneur really believes that &quot;spoof pictures&quot; are insulting or infringing, then he certainly has the right to initiate legal proceedings and use legal weapons to protect his legitimate rights and interests like ordinary people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, we can see that well-known entrepreneurs generally have a tolerant and generous attitude towards life when faced with attacks, abuses, and pranks. After all, compared with the turbulent waves of the business world, &quot;portraits being pranked&quot; are sometimes an extra boost for entrepreneurs and a small comment on the &quot;entrepreneurial spirit.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 21 Sep 2023 15:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[苦等五年，第二批罕见病目录公布：新增86个病种]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257274]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-21 13:15:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/21/Cig8PapifnL34jPiIf4CiVkuwLzvF8PVvESVrRTB.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1082&quot; height=&quot;721&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/21/Cig8PapifnL34jPiIf4CiVkuwLzvF8PVvESV rRTB. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251495&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On January 7, 2022, Xiamen Maternal and Child Health Hospital, medical staff sampled rare diseases Noxinaxen Sodium Injection, a specific drug for spinal muscular atrophy, is ready to be injected into children. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the evening of September 20, 2023, the official website of the National Health Commission announced the second batch of rare disease catalogs. Add 86 rare diseases such as achondroplasia to the catalog, and the registration date is September 18. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“(This is) something that everyone has been calling for for a long time.” For Huang Rufang, founder of the Coude Rare Disease Center, as well as many rare disease patients and related medical professionals, this is a five-year battle. Much eager waiting. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In May 2018, five departments including the National Health Commission jointly formulated the &quot;First Batch Rare Disease Catalog&quot;, which for the first time disclosed 121 rare diseases to the public in the form of a catalog. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This catalog provides an important basis for various departments to formulate policies related to rare diseases. The health department organizes efforts to clarify diagnosis and treatment guidelines for these diseases one by one, and relies on industry organizations to carry out training for medical personnel to improve the standardized diagnosis and treatment of rare diseases. ability. At the same time, a series of supporting systems have been introduced to strengthen the research and development of rare disease-related drugs, accelerate review and approval, and access to medical insurance, which have greatly improved the current situation of rare disease diagnosis and treatment in China. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As of now, a total of 207 rare diseases have been included in the two batches of rare disease catalogs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/21/E5gEIt4kPP1SGOGXeuadq6Dpjbou9c1Y4Hh1lnJl.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1269&quot; height= &quot;914&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/21/E5gEIt4kPP1SGOGXeuadq6Dpjbou9c1Y4Hh1lnJl.png&quot; data-key=&quot;251496&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Screenshot/picture of the official website of the National Health Commission)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;Many I have never heard of the disease.&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&quot;To be honest, I have never heard of many diseases, and I don’t know what to say.&quot; Xing Huanping of Meier SMA Care Center saw She told Southern Weekend reporters after the second batch of rare disease catalogues. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among the 20 million rare disease patients in China, the SMA (spinal muscular atrophy) patients helped by Xing Huanping are lucky to have technological breakthroughs from pharmaceutical companies and good opportunities from government reforms. In 2018, SMA was also included in the first batch of rare disease catalogs, and two innovative drugs for symptomatic treatment were approved for marketing in China and entered the national medical insurance catalog. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Many rare disease patients and families who were not included in the first batch of catalogs are looking forward to the second batch of catalogs being released, hoping that their diseases will be included in the catalog, so that everyone can at least be seen and have access to the list. More hope.&quot; Xing Huanping said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past five years, all sectors of society have paid close attention to the expansion of this &quot;niche&quot; directory, and the National Health Commission has also disclosed the progress. In February 2022, the &quot;Reply to Recommendation No. 9415 of the Fourth Session of the Thirteenth National People&#39;s Congress&quot; published on the official website of the National Health Commission mentioned that the selection process for the second batch of rare disease catalogs has been launched in due course in accordance with regulations and is in the process of material review. stage. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Up to that time, the National Health Commission had successively received applications for adding disease categories submitted by relevant departments, &quot;more than 200 copies of relevant materials.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Why are these rare diseases included? &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;There are more than 7,000 rare diseases in the world, and there are more than 1,000 rare diseases in China. Therefore, catalog selection requires considerable prudence and science. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the &quot;Working Procedures for Formulating the Catalog of Rare Diseases&quot; issued by the National Health Commission in May 2018, the catalog should be formulated based on national conditions and fully combined with factors such as economic development, population situation, and social security levels. And refer to the management experience of countries or regions with similar social development levels to our country. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The diseases included in the catalog should meet the following conditions at the same time: there is international and domestic evidence that the incidence or prevalence is low; it is harmful to patients and families; there are clear diagnostic methods; there are treatment or intervention methods , affordable, or there is no effective treatment or intervention but it has been included in the national scientific research project. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, in November 2019, the China Rare Disease Diagnosis and Treatment Service Information System established and developed by the National Health Commission was put into use, and 324 hospitals in the National Rare Disease Diagnosis and Treatment Collaboration Network began to use the system to register rare disease cases. Work. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;This system has collected information on about 500,000 rare disease patients. This information is of great significance for gradually understanding the number and distribution of rare disease patients in my country, diagnosis and treatment bottlenecks, disease burden and difficulties, etc. It has important guiding value for government departments to formulate a more scientific and reasonable national strategic plan for rare diseases.&quot; the National Health Commission mentioned in the aforementioned reply. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;“There will be more challenges in the future”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Ma Tao, Executive Secretary of the Beijing Sickness Challenge Charity Foundation, learned that the second batch of catalogs was announced, and the first Immediately, I forwarded the news to the WeChat group where my colleagues and the person in charge of the patient organization belong. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“On the whole, some of the diseases included in the second batch of catalogs have related patient organizations. These rare disease patient organizations have also done a lot of appeals in recent years, and everyone’s efforts have finally come to fruition. .&quot; Ma Tao told Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After calming down, Ma Tao, who has been paying attention to rare diseases for many years, thought that the release of the second batch of catalogs might be the beginning of another long journey. How to diagnose, treat, protect and return more diseases to society requires joint attention and investment of resources from all walks of life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporters noticed that in addition to rare disease organizations, some pharmaceutical companies with related rare disease drug research and development also successively forwarded news of the second batch of catalog announcements on the 20th, such as Zai Lab, Langyu group. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;There will be more challenges in the future. For the Pain Challenge Foundation team, our service scope and service capabilities also need to quickly adjust and improve, and continue to work hard.&quot; Ma Tao said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/21/lrktG44jOOsvFv6MGB3BeOCFImNK4k0GmWYA4lAm.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;984&quot; height= &quot;1152&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/21/lrktG44jOOsvFv6MGB3BeOCFImNK4k0GmWYA4lAm.png&quot; data-key=&quot;251497&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Screenshot/picture from the official website of the National Health Commission)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot; http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/21/xTVCDAsUlGlKwYhATyMOTbndqtmWN86cFIIMJfxX.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;958&quot; height=&quot;1174&quot; data-src=&quot;//images. infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/21/xTVCDAsUlGlKwYhATyMOTbndqtmWN86cFIIMJfxX.png&quot; data-key=&quot;251500&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>; &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Screenshot/picture from the official website of the National Health Commission)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/ medias/image/23/09/21/odwQpM9PwOk0QfEGV1yAfwXjkVUxWKGa5xxp2s6Q.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;966&quot; height=&quot;1172&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/21/odwQpM9PwOk0QfEGV1yAfwXjkVUxWKGa5xxp2s6Q.png&quot; data-key=&quot;251498&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>; (Screenshot/picture of the official website of the National Health Commission)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/21/V0dpaBgEqDAfsmKEB5WCxy6jOvBiogAMhDqrBF0W. png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;948&quot; height=&quot;1170&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/21/V0dpaBgEqDAfsmKEB5WCxy6jOvBiogAMhDqrBF0W.png&quot; data-key= &quot;251499&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Screenshot/picture of the official website of the National Health Commission)&lt;/ span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/21/TsYEQMGbCvSpIMNw7927zlhOaQunMAzCsHpssWuj.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;948&quot; height=&quot;1054&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/21/TsYEQMGbCvSpIMNw7927zlhOaQunMAzCsHpssWuj.png&quot; data-key=&quot;251501&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style= &quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Screenshot/picture from the official website of the National Health Commission)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p >;</description><pubDate> Thu, 21 Sep 2023 13:55:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[“特产互寄”走红，不出门体验当地特色，真的香吗]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257222]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-21 13:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 21 Sep 2023 13:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[广州多区取消限购，买房不再受户籍和社保限制]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257250]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-21 11:30:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/21/F9TJYfwjWZ9iJm0jvRlDsk1tav3YuMXNvpnEy8EH.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;654&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/21/F9TJYfwjWZ9iJm0jvRlDsk1t av3YuMXNvpnEy8EH. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251493&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Huangpu District in Guangzhou is one of the three districts where purchase restrictions have been relaxed this time. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;You can buy as many sets as you want, anyone can buy them.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p >;On September 20, 2023, Guangzhou released new real estate regulation policies. Li Yujia, chief researcher of the Guangdong Provincial Housing Policy Research Center, was invited by relevant departments to write relevant comments one day in advance. He learned that Guangzhou, except for core areas, has lifted purchase restrictions, and buying a house is no longer subject to household registration and social security restrictions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This means that Guangzhou has become the first city among China’s first-tier cities to relax purchase restrictions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the &quot;Notice of the General Office of the Guangzhou Municipal People&#39;s Government on Optimizing Policies for the Stable and Healthy Development of the City&#39;s Real Estate Market&quot;, the purchase restriction areas only mention parts of Yuexiu, Haizhu, Liwan, Tianhe, Nansha and Baiyun Districts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In these 6 districts, households registered in Guangzhou are limited to purchasing 2 units; households not registered in the city are limited to purchasing 1 unit after paying social security for 2 years, and the time to pay social security is shortened from 5 years to 2 years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Previously, only two of the 11 districts in Guangzhou, Conghua and Zengcheng, had no purchase restrictions. After the policy adjustment, Huangpu, Panyu and Huadu were added to the non-restricted areas. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Real estate prices are starting to increase&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Guangzhou’s new property market policy was announced at around 6 p.m. Zheng Yang, a real estate consultant, was working at a sales office in Huangpu District. Not long ago Foreign customers who are in a hurry to buy a house come to inquire about the qualifications for buying a house. After seeing the news, Zheng Yang immediately contacted the other party and said that the house that was not available for purchase more than an hour ago can now be purchased. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zheng Yang said that the company has not had time to react and the price has not been adjusted for the time being. Due to sluggish sales, the price of this property was lowered some time ago. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Huangpu District is about 30 kilometers away from the city center. It is one of the gathering places for home buyers in Guangzhou. Other areas where purchase restrictions have been lifted are similar to Huangpu. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Yujia analyzed to Southern Weekend reporters that Guangzhou currently maintains purchase restrictions mainly in the four central urban areas of Yuexiu, Haizhu, Liwan and Tianhe. These areas were developed earlier and are mainly housing stock, with low elasticity of supply. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, Baiyun is close to the central area and has convenient transportation. It is located in the sub-periphery. There are many new Guangzhou residents buying homes but the supply is small, and the purchase restriction policy has also been maintained. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Nansha, which is far away from the central city, aims to create a platform for entrepreneurship, innovation, and livability in the Greater Bay Area. It is an important area for Hong Kong and Macao residents to start businesses and live in the mainland. Therefore, despite the long real estate inventory cycle in recent years, we still insist on purchasing restrictions to reduce dependence on real estate and create conditions for the concentration of industries and talents. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A real estate project in Nansha is raising prices. A real estate consultant told Southern Weekend reporters that after the new policy is introduced, price adjustments will be implemented faster. By next week at the latest, the average real estate price will increase by 5%-8%. He believes that maintaining purchase restrictions represents the value of Nansha District. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Pay less value-added tax on second-hand houses&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In addition to relaxing purchase restrictions, the new policy also proposes to include Yuexiu, Haizhu, Liwan, Tianhe, Baiyun, Huangpu, Panyu, and Nansha , Zengcheng and other districts have adjusted the value-added tax exemption period for individual sales of housing from 5 years to 2 years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As soon as this policy for second-hand houses came out, seven or eight new houses were listed in several communities that Song Ming was responsible for within a few hours, and two owners contacted him to lower the sales price. Song Ming has been a second-hand housing agent in Yuexiu District for eight years and now maintains more than a dozen properties. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Song Ming told Southern Weekend reporters that life will not be easy in 2023. The company&#39;s gold medal brokers can only sell one house a month, and many peers cannot sell one in half a year. It is the peak sales season of &quot;Golden Nine and Silver Ten&quot;, and the market is still sluggish. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Yujia said that from July to August 2023, Guangzhou’s second-hand housing price index fell among the top 70 cities in the country. The purpose of changing the value-added tax exemption period from 5 years to 2 years is to reduce the cost of transaction links, promote the smoothness of selling and buying, not only satisfy the immediate needs but also ease the demand for house replacement, and ensure the entry of transactions of rigid needs and improvements, new houses and second-hand houses. A virtuous cycle. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the introduction of the New Deal, Li Yujia predicts that in the remaining four months of the year, Guangzhou’s commercial housing market is expected to gradually shift from a continued excessive decline to a bottoming out and stabilizing trend. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In his view, the Guangzhou New Deal is the implementation of the spirit of the Political Bureau meeting of the Central Committee on July 24, 2023. This meeting proposed that we should adapt to the new situation of major changes in real estate supply and demand, implement city-specific policies and make good use of the policy toolbox, and meet residents&#39; rigid and improved housing needs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“This is not a cyclical change, but a trend change.” Li Yujia said that during the long-term overheating period in the past, the regulatory policies characterized by tightening and demand-side suppression are no longer applicable.

After buying the set meal, when I went to the store to consume it, I was told that I couldn&#39;t use it and was kicked out of the store. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I have family members who are in business, and it is very common for businesspeople to get prices wrong. On the merchant&#39;s side, once the wrong price is marked, it means a loss of profits. 788 seconds will change to 1. The gap is too big. You can imagine the anxiety in your heart. The store involved stated that it had a live broadcast on the evening of September 9, and the promotional price of the package originally priced at 1,488 yuan was 788 yuan. However, due to a platform system problem, the price was mistakenly changed to &quot;1 yuan purchase&quot;, which triggered panic buying. When it was discovered that it had been It was too late, 500 copies were already sold out in 20 minutes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The platform responded that the 1-yuan package was caused by a mistake in the merchant&#39;s own settings. Regarding the merchant&#39;s own practice of setting the store to permanently close in the background, the platform stated that its account has not been canceled and the agreement between the two parties remains. Take effect. Considering the user experience, the platform did not forcefully cancel orders, actively handled customer complaints, and provided some compensation to consumers in advance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After getting the price wrong, there are roughly two ways to deal with it. One is to &quot;cancel&quot; the wrong price and recover the loss. The merchants involved actually did this later. In order to protect their interests, they even used non-hospitality methods to drive people away. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is worth noting that the merchant&#39;s &quot;repentance&quot; is not without legal basis, because the customer in this incident was involved in &quot;unjust enrichment.&quot; The Civil Code clearly defines unjust enrichment: the fact that there is no legal basis and causes others to suffer losses while oneself gains benefits. Although there is still room for debate as to whether consumers&#39; &quot;1 for 788&quot; behavior is an act of unjust enrichment, because some merchants do engage in such preferential activities, but there is no doubt that merchants have used legal means to put &quot;bleeding bandages&quot; on themselves s right. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In reality, the phenomenon of &quot;snatching wool&quot; by taking advantage of merchants&#39; incorrect pricing occurs frequently, and it is not uncommon for businesses to be stopped according to law. On January 16, 2021, the staff of Chow Tai Fook&#39;s official flagship store entered an incorrect price into the system, and Wang and his wife spent 40,000 yuan to buy gold jewelry with an original price of 250,000 yuan. Chow Tai Fook asked him to cancel the order and was willing to pay the couple 500 yuan each as compensation. After being refused, Chow Tai Fook took Wang and his wife to court. The court ruled that the online shopping contract entered into between the two parties should be revoked. The reason is that Chow Tai Fook marked the price of the gold jewelry involved in the case as far lower than the purchase and actual sales price, which is obviously inconsistent with normal merchant sales behavior, and Wang and his wife failed to provide corresponding evidence to prove that the plaintiff engaged in low-price promotions. Behavior. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But no matter what, the mistakes made by merchants are not caused by consumers. When consumers&#39; enthusiasm for &quot;squeezing out wool&quot; is extinguished by cold water, the reputation of the business may also be damaged. A bright double-edged sword is visible. The aforementioned “788 Set Meal Store” was deducted 3 business points by the platform, and caused a stir on the Internet. The heavy hidden price paid for this is clear evidence. The market economy is a credit economy. When merchants are unwilling to bear the consequences of mistakes, credit has been put into question. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another way is to make mistakes and let consumers benefit. But such courageous merchants are rare. In fact, the &quot;one-yuan set meal&quot; is not unrealistic. Many merchants have launched &quot;one-yuan dishes&quot; and &quot;free tastings&quot; in the past, so it is understandable that consumers have expectations of a &quot;one-yuan set meal.&quot; If a merchant believes that instead of trying to &quot;repair&quot; the bad impression it has caused to consumers, it is better to accept the order generously and let consumers enjoy it, then the merchant is likely to obtain unprecedented benefits by becoming a party to a top-notch news event. self-exposure effect. In an era where traffic is king, this kind of focus effect caused by the explosion of public discussion spaces cannot be obtained by spending money on advertising. What&#39;s more, doing so itself is also a warning to one&#39;s own behavior. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; According to reports, on October 26, 2021, there was a price error in the Yuanqi Forest official store. The original price of 79 yuan for a box (12 bottles) of sparkling water was changed to 10 yuan for 3 boxes, causing users to place crazy orders. , apparently the Vitality Forest suffered heavy losses. However, some people pointed out afterwards that the exposure, popularity, traffic and discussion gained by Yuanqi Forest in this incident brought the brand publicity value to more than 40 million yuan, which far exceeded the losses caused by &quot;mistakes&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is no absolute &quot;standard&quot; for how to view and calculate the gains and losses involved, but there is no doubt that the public&#39;s feelings in such incidents cannot be underestimated. Consumers come to the store with the hope of enjoying the &quot;one-yuan set meal&quot; but return disappointed. This result is unfair and unfriendly to consumers. In similar incidents, merchants or platforms often use &quot;compensation&quot; to explain the problem, indicating that they are somewhat aware of this problem, but in many cases, merchants do not do enough. This is also the root cause of many consumer complaints. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Think of this, what choice should a person make when he makes a mistake. Whether to admit your mistake or not is a choice of interests, but also a moral choice. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In interpersonal communication, we should not take advantage of other people&#39;s mistakes. This is a normal way of being a human being. But when we make a mistake ourselves, we must consider from a moral perspective whether we should have the courage to admit the mistake and bear all the &quot;costs&quot; it brings, or whether we should try our best to cover it up, deny it, and pass the blame to others. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, when the economic cost of making a mistake is too great for an individual to bear, it is not incomprehensible to try to gain forgiveness from others and thus get a chance to &quot;recover.&quot; But this is an extreme situation after all. Under normal circumstances, as long as admitting our mistakes will not cause us to be &quot;broken&quot; or unable to sink, we should still face right and wrong with a realistic and unavoidable attitude. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If merchants can still &quot;withdraw&quot; the wrong price, then people cannot &quot;withdraw&quot; what has happened in social media. In this case, whether you care about temporary gains and losses, or whether you care more about long-term reputation (meaning long-term gains and losses), is a very test of character. Facts have shown that we can never completely avoid making mistakes, but being good at &quot;paying for&quot; our mistakes after making them is a knowledge that urgently needs to be &quot;popularized&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 21 Sep 2023 11:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[长沙欢迎研发：一场以研发为名的“双转型”]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257248]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-21 10:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/21/KpQ4bok8YdveVizq9XBCdcLO6aGmzuqVS6fUixGi.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;540&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/21/KpQ4bok8YdveVizq9XBCdcLO6aGmzuqVS6fU ixGi. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251475&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;There is a surging crowd outside Cha Yan Yuese&#39;s shop. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of interviewee)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the summer of 2018, Hu Biliang, who had studied and worked in the United States for more than ten years, decided to return to China. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since 2007, Hu Biliang has studied at the University of Southern California and the University of Pennsylvania, studying under the &quot;father of CAR-T cell therapy&quot; Carl June. After receiving his PhD in the field of cellular immunotherapy, Hu Biliang is also paying close attention to the development of the domestic biopharmaceutical industry. In June 2018, having already started a family in the United States, he decided to return to Changsha with bare hands and start from scratch. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Three years later, another summer, four kilometers away from Hu Biliang&#39;s office, a new R&amp;D institution with the functions of talent gathering, cutting-edge research and achievement transformation - Peking University Changsha Computing and Digital Economy Research The institute (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;hereinafter referred to as &quot;Peking University Changsha Research Institute&quot;&lt;/span>;) was opened. Bai Zengding, who has been recognized as a high-level talent in a certain first-tier city, decided to give up a subsidy of nearly one million yuan and join the institute. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Changsha, an Internet celebrity city, is extremely popular on social media, especially in summer. As a popular summer travel destination, there is even a joke circulating here that &quot;Yuelu Mountain was stepped down by 2cm due to tourists.&quot; However, somewhat unexpectedly, as tourists are coming in droves, top scientific and technological talents are also coming. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Changsha welcomes research and development.&quot; This unwritten city attitude has been regarded as a guideline by local politicians before, and finally made its highlight debut in the summer of 2023. On June 19, Shen Xiaoming, Secretary of the Hunan Provincial Party Committee, announced at the opening ceremony of the Yuelu Internet Summit that Changsha is planned to become a global R&amp;D center city. On July 30, the Changsha Municipal Government issued relevant policies and implementation opinions. On September 1, a group of scientific and technological R&amp;D institutions from universities, scientific research institutions, and leading enterprises unveiled their names on site or signed contracts to start construction at the first opening ceremony of Changsha&#39;s efforts to build a global R&amp;D center city. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A research and development craze began to stir up this central city. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Behind the craze, there are more mysteries of urban development worth studying. After investigation, Southern Weekend found that Changsha’s plan to build a global R&amp;D center city and the micro-innovation practices of this long-established construction machinery capital reveal two transformation models currently taking place in Changsha: First, the integration of manufacturing centers into R&amp;D centers Transformation; second, the integration and transformation from production center to life center. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Driven by the &quot;dual transformation&quot;, Changsha&#39;s urban functions and innovation levels are quietly undergoing spiral advancement. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/21/6SXRBhrbyDeoO8GPXQ62tjSsf51l3OfWzy3kWnuE.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/21/6SXRBhrbyDeoO8GPXQ62tjSsf51l3OfWzy3kWnuE.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251478&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The smart mobility chassis developed by Changsha Automobile Innovation Research Institute can realize functions such as four-wheel independent steering and four-wheel independent drive, and can easily complete U-turns and lateral driving on the spot. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Changsha Evening News all-media reporter Yi Yi/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Interactive network of developers&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&quot;I personally have always I am doing research and development in the direction of biopharmaceuticals, hoping to develop a better innovative drug through my own technological innovation.&quot; Having been engaged in virus-related research and gene therapy for more than ten years, Hu Biliang has always regarded the research and development of innovative drugs as a professional pursuit and life goals. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many people did not understand his decision to return to Changsha from the United States to continue this research career, but Hu Biliang had his own considerations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Hunan’s biopharmaceutical industry does have a weak foundation compared to the United States. But if an innovative drug can be produced here, it will not only bring better treatment options to tumor patients in our hometown, but also I can also contribute to the development of the biopharmaceutical industry in my hometown, which is also the core value and significance I pursue in my technology research and development journey.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;With such fighting spirit and expectations, in the summer of 2018 , Hu Biliang returned to Changsha alone with bare hands to make preliminary preparations for starting a business. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Soon, he was no longer alone. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Here we have support from colleagues in terms of laboratories and equipment, preferential treatment for factories in industrial parks, and assistance from government talent and entrepreneurship policies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hu Biliang detailed the help he received from many sources during his entrepreneurial journey and attributed it to &quot;luck.&quot; But in fact, behind this &quot;luck&quot; is the entire city&#39;s respect for the high-tech industry, its preference for high-tech talents, and its expectations for the achievements of high-tech wisdom. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In such an environment, the implementation process of research and development is relatively smooth. In 2023, Hunan Siweikang Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. founded by Hu Biliang received clinical trial approval for a national Class 1 new drug. This is the first biopharmaceutical IND approval in Hunan Province, which is of great significance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Hu Biliang’s plan, in the next three years, the first clinical trial of cell drugs will be completed, and the cell drugs developed by the team can be successfully launched. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is not only a technological milestone breakthrough, but also the starting point for the vigorous development of a regional industry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Both are new research and development forces, and they also chose Changsha, but Peking University Changsha Research Institute is the starting point of a different story. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As an important platform for the transformation of Peking University’s scientific research results, the institute’s research centers fully considered Changsha’s local industrial characteristics when they were first established to “get closer to the market frontier and industrial needs.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Digital Transformation Promotion Center where Bai Zengding is located conducts applied research around data elements and is committed to serving the national strategy of enterprise digital transformation and traditional industry upgrading; the Industrial Intelligence Research Center next door is oriented towards intelligence. The digital transformation needs of manufacturing, logistics and transportation, supply chain and other fields enable the digital transformation and upgrading of enterprises through data, algorithms and models. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Changsha is a big manufacturing city. From hardware, software to cloud services, as well as the huge amount of data in the manufacturing production and processing links, it provides us with a very rich material library, which is why we chose to come here. The reason for being a platform for the transformation of scientific and technological achievements.&quot; Bai Zengding said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to overseas R&amp;D teams and new R&amp;D institutions, there is also a third type of &quot;foreign force&quot; worthy of attention—foreign-funded R&amp;D centers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On one side are newcomers. In 2019, Schaeffler established the second R&amp;D center in Greater China in Xiangjiang New District, and closely interacted with local enterprises Xiangjiang Intelligent and Xidi Intelligent Driving. Through collaborative R&amp;D and information sharing, it accelerated the development of Changsha&#39;s intelligent connected automobile industry. Development process. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One is to increase investment. For example, Soenger China plans to invest a total of 3 billion yuan and continue to increase its R&amp;D investment in Changsha. The newly built Soenger Global New Energy Products and Technology R&amp;D Center has a construction area of ​​tens of thousands of square meters and is expected to be put into use within the year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;With the influx of new foreign R&amp;D forces, R&amp;D paradigms of local companies are also sprouting. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Industry is the source of innovation, and enterprises are the core subject of innovation. According to Du Debin, dean of the Institute of Global Innovation and Development at East China Normal University, Changsha, the capital of central China, needs to build a global R&amp;D center city based on its own advantageous industries, conduct differentiated competition, cultivate global R&amp;D centers in subdivided industries, and then spread through innovation. The effect gradually moves closer to the target. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Take construction machinery as an example. In 2007, when Hu Biliang went abroad for further study, Shi Wenbing graduated from Huazhong University of Science and Technology majoring in mechanics. Full of longing for the future, he got on the school recruitment bus of Sany Heavy Industry. Soon after, Lu Chuang, who came from Yichang, Hubei Province, decided to continue his studies in the mechanical major of Central South University. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Here is the most active market and the most cutting-edge technology in the construction machinery industry.” With the same expectation, the two came to Changsha one after another. Since then, the paths of fate have secretly marked their intersection. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fifteen years later, Shi Wenbing became a senior engineer of Sany Heavy Industry, leading a number of major R&amp;D projects, constantly breaking through technical bottlenecks, and going global with the company, using global innovation resources to carry out technological research. It is understood that SANY Group’s overseas business now covers more than 160 countries and regions, and it has 13 overseas manufacturing centers in the United States, Germany, India, Brazil, and Indonesia. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After working at the State-owned Enterprise Research Institute for 8 years, Lu Chuang joined an upstream company that provided products and services to Sany Heavy Industry and served as the general manager of Hunan Zhongji Shenyi Testing Technology Co., Ltd., establishing a testing center from scratch. The test base fills the gaps in some testing and pilot service projects for construction machinery and core components. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the same industrial chain, in different positions, the chain owner enterprises and supporting enterprises each perform their own duties and jointly contribute to the industrial iteration of construction machinery. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Top overseas R&amp;D teams have settled in Changsha, laying the foundation for building chains for emerging industries; new foreign R&amp;D institutions are highly consistent with local industrial clusters; foreign-funded R&amp;D centers continue to increase their presence and interact closely with local companies; at the same time, Changsha Leading companies go global, supporting companies collaborate with each other, and the chain has close relationships and collaborative research. The panorama of Changsha’s R&amp;D entities has basically emerged. Various types of R&amp;D entities show their talents and release the energy of innovation. This is a real and frequent innovation story happening in Changsha. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the view of Wang Fan, director of the Science and Technology and Standards Institute of CCID Research Institute, Changsha’s innovative practices coincide with his views. Wang Fan believes that in building Changsha into a global R&amp;D center city, chain owners should play a leading role, promote in-depth cooperation between large and small enterprises in the chain, continuously strengthen and optimize the chain, and form leading enterprises, supporting enterprises, colleges and universities, and scientific research institutions. An ecological development pattern of collaborative linkage, competition, cooperation and symbiosis among institutes, third-party platforms, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Because of their existence, the goal of becoming a global R&amp;D center city is not unrealistic. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Under the prosperous R&amp;D panorama, what is the driving force that nourishes its vigorous growth? In other words, why does Changsha need R&amp;D so much? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/21/ICcdKzLORYoraEapZrlBHrva0dplbH8IVfOb9GKC.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/21/ICcdKzLORYoraEapZrlBHrva0dplbH8IVfOb9GKC.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251477&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Shenyi researchers are conducting simulation assembly experiments. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of interviewee)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Two-way drive of R&amp;D and manufacturing&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Want to answer the above questions , we must first understand Changsha’s industrial background. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are seven major 100-billion-level manufacturing industry clusters here, including engineering machinery, automobiles and parts, new materials, electronic information, and energy storage materials. The total digital economy has exceeded 450 billion yuan, and high-tech industries have increased. The average annual growth rate is more than 10%, accounting for 29.6% of GDP. It is also home to the third largest construction machinery industry cluster in the world. The other two are Illinois in the United States and Tokyo in Japan. It is known as the &quot;Construction Machinery Capital of China&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to CCID Consulting&#39;s &quot;Research Report on the Top 100 Advanced Manufacturing Cities (2022)&quot;, Changsha ranks eighth in the development of advanced manufacturing, ranking first among cities in the central and western regions. This city, which is famous for its soft power of &quot;entertainment&quot;, is also closely related to the hard-core &quot;manufacturing&quot; industry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But at the same time, a background of the post-epidemic era that cannot be ignored is the dramatic changes in the international economic and trade pattern, the weakening of the domestic demographic dividend and the tight industrial space. The combined effects of multiple factors have led to the transformation and upgrading of China&#39;s manufacturing industry. Imminent. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Based on the views of many researchers, this boom in scientific and technological innovation in the name of research and development, which occurred in the manufacturing city of Changsha, has a certain inevitability: to strengthen technology research and development innovation, increase the localization substitution rate, It is not only a &quot;charge&quot; for the transformation and upgrading of the manufacturing industry, but also a &quot;battle&quot; for core technology dominance, and it is also a &quot;pursuit battle&quot; for the ranking of central cities in the new round of industrial revolution. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;R&amp;D means &quot;research and development&quot; and refers to the key links in the manufacturing industry from laboratory technology to new product development. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Changsha’s proposal to build a global R&amp;D center city is actually a signaling mechanism with a very clear goal, and has a clear intention of leading the way in industrial transformation and upgrading.” Chen Ling, director of the Industrial Development and Environmental Governance Research Center of Tsinghua University, said Now, Changsha is the first city to specifically focus on the &quot;R&amp;D link&quot; as a brand building. In a sense, it takes advantage of local manufacturing advantages to take the lead in the transformation and upgrading of the manufacturing industry driven by R&amp;D breakthroughs or innovation. Judging from the local government&#39;s strategic planning, Changsha City does not intend to leave this transformation and upgrading completely to the market&#39;s own trial and error, but to carry out large-scale planning, layout and investment through the government&#39;s organized approach. This is a comparison Outstanding features. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The source of the government’s organized and planned leadership behavior still comes from enterprises. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the 2018 National People’s Congress and the National People’s Congress, Liang Wengen, then chairman of Sany Group, once proposed that in the face of the digitization of construction machinery and manufacturing, the group would “either turn over or capsize.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2022, Sany Heavy Industry Changsha Factory No. 18 was rated as a &quot;Lighthouse Factory&quot;. This is the second one in Hunan Province and represents the highest level of intelligent manufacturing and digitalization in the global manufacturing field. All equipment in the factory is connected to the Internet, and the flow of production information, usage, and assembly line information is completely connected. All parts transfers in the factory are carried out by AGV (Automated Guided Transport Vehicle) automatic distribution robots. Industrial robots replace manual work, and &quot;cost reduction and efficiency increase&quot;, a synonym for high-quality development, is supported by vivid scenes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Gaudi, who has been deeply involved in the field of robotics for more than ten years, has long-term observations and thoughts on how technological research and development can change the traditional manufacturing industry. Changtai Robotics, where he works, takes it as its mission to explore manufacturing technology upgrade scenarios and meet application needs. In Gaudi’s view, if Changsha wants to achieve a global leadership position in the field of industrial robots, Changsha may be able to focus on the software and industrial Internet tracks to create differentiated advantages. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Therefore, Gaudi focuses on recruiting high-tech talents in the field of artificial intelligence. Guo Dongni, who is also from Northeast China, is one of the good candidates. This seemingly fair and well-behaved female engineer born in 1995 is actually the leader of the machine vision and artificial intelligence algorithm research and development project team. She once led a &quot;women&#39;s army&quot; with master&#39;s degrees with an average age of less than 30 years old to develop cloth defects with independent intellectual property rights. The inspection system - &quot;ZTVT tire base non-woven fabric self-learning vision system&quot; uses artificial intelligence to liberate workers&#39; eyes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhangtai Robot is not an exception. A number of specialized and new enterprises such as Super Robot and Dingli Technology are relying on Changsha&#39;s scientific and educational resources and industrial advantages to explode with vigorous innovation vitality in many fields such as robots, intelligent equipment, and new materials. Accelerate the industrial upgrading process through technological breakthroughs in subdivided fields. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Technological innovation actually includes two aspects. One is to spawn new products through technological innovation, which may eventually form a new industry; the other is to promote industrial upgrading through scientific and technological innovation. . The demand for the latter will always exist, and the volume is larger.&quot; Du Debin analyzed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In his view, Changsha’s construction of a global R&amp;D center city requires a series of measures to gather a large number of R&amp;D centers, including those of multinational companies, local R&amp;D centers, new R&amp;D centers, etc. Type, promote innovation in business models and technologies, thereby driving industrial upgrading and transformation of urban functions, transforming Changsha from a product production center to a knowledge production center. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are many international city cases for the transformation and upgrading of the manufacturing industry. Judging from the relationship between product production centers (manufacturing centers) and knowledge production centers (R&amp;D centers), they can be roughly divided into three types: &lt;/p >; &lt;p>;The first is the model represented by Hong Kong. Due to the rising cost of production factors, since the reform and opening up, Hong Kong has transferred manufacturing to the Pearl River Delta region through the &quot;three to one supplement&quot; model. However, it has not turned to the development of R&amp;D, but has transformed into a financial industry and modern service industry. International financial center - South Korea, Singapore and Taiwan, also the &quot;Four Asian Tigers&quot;, have established their own R&amp;D networks. However, Hong Kong has always paid attention to R&amp;D. In the 1990s, it explored government actions to promote R&amp;D such as the &quot;Cyberport&quot; plan. Now it is vigorously developing innovative technology and creating a &quot;Northern Region&quot; that integrates Shenzhen&#39;s scientific and technological resources. metropolitan area.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The second is the &quot;unitary system&quot; model represented by Detroit. As the heartland of the U.S. automobile industry, Detroit once experienced rapid population loss and rapid industrial decline due to the pace of transformation and upgrading that was slower than market changes. After being stimulated and guided by a series of recovery plans, Detroit has now transformed into a research and development center for the automobile industry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Munich, which also has the automobile industry as its pillar industry, has taken a completely different industrial path from Detroit. There is BMW&#39;s oldest factory here, as well as the R&amp;D headquarters of automobile companies such as Audi and MAN Group. It is a &quot;dual integration&quot; model that combines production and R&amp;D. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Du Debin’s view, faced with an industrial structure dominated by the real economy, many cities in China should refer to the development experience of Munich’s automobile industry and encourage companies to conduct technology research and development while retaining production centers and R&amp;D centers. &quot;Integration, transformation, and both are the goals for the healthy development of our city&#39;s industries.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Returning to Changsha from overseas cities, it is not difficult to find that with manufacturing as the priority, we are now building a global R&amp;D center Isn’t Changsha a latecomer to the “Munich Model”? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A variety of R&amp;D entities come together and are closely linked with each other. Its essence comes from Changsha&#39;s good industrial foundation. New technologies have huge market demand and application scenarios here, thus urging rapid iteration of technology; and new R&amp;D results will empower the manufacturing industry to upgrade and promote its transformation from scale to R&amp;D and brand. Wait for the two ends of the smile curve to shift. The two-way drive between R&amp;D and manufacturing works together to improve urban competitiveness. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At this point, we have seen the full picture of Changsha&#39;s first &quot;transformation&quot;: from a manufacturing center to a R&amp;D hub, from a product production center to a knowledge production center, and it is not a one-way transformation from &quot;you &quot;To &quot;I&quot;, it is the fusion of two centers, the synergy of &quot;manufacturing&quot; and &quot;R&amp;D&quot;, and the symbiosis of &quot;product production&quot; and &quot;knowledge production&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What is even more valuable is that in Changsha, this &quot;integrated transformation&quot; model not only occurs in the production of products and knowledge, but also occurs in the balance between the &quot;production center&quot; and the &quot;life center&quot; middle. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/21/FM1Ft4HE3SUe23WhfemVZKpDJ0Rl7Xib6mxHmjTN.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1181&quot; height= &quot;2067&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/21/FM1Ft4HE3SUe23WhfemVZKpDJ0Rl7Xib6mxHmjTN.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251476&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Liang Shuyi/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The secret of &quot;attracting and retaining&quot; talents&lt;/ h4>; &lt;p>;The balance and integration of production center and life center is Changsha’s unique urban advantage. The direct impact of this feature is to attract a large number of talents. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past ten years, Changsha’s permanent population has grown by 32.3%, ranking among the top cities in China in both absolute value and rate of population growth. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Chen Ling introduced that according to the &quot;Global Innovation Hubs Index 2022&quot; released by Tsinghua University&#39;s Center for Industrial Development and Environmental Governance (CIDEG) and Springer Nature Group (Nature Research) Index, GIHI2022) report, Changsha performs well in talent-related indicators, such as the inflow of professional talents per million people, the number of active scientific researchers per million people, the number of highly cited scientists and other indicators, almost all of which are in the 50-70% range globally. Ranking of names. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Talent is the core element of innovation, and those who get talents will win the future. Many data show that the city of Changsha has advantages over other cities in terms of talent attraction. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is not only the return of Hunan talents such as Hu Biliang and Bai Zengding, but also the promised land for Hubei talents such as Shi Wenbing and Lu Chuang. It is also the common choice of fellow Northeasterners from different generations such as Gao Di and Guo Dongni... …&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The pace of talent has already broken through the restrictions of geographical areas and shown new flow patterns. Many experts have pointed out that the secret of &quot;attracting and retaining&quot; talents lies not only in the existing law of &quot;people follow the industry&quot;, but also in the balanced integration of urban production centers and life centers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The key to the latter is whether it can meet the material needs of talents for career growth and labor returns; whether it can meet the needs of talents for housing prices, education, medical care and other public services; Meet the spiritual needs of talents for public spaces such as culture, leisure, and consumption. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Satisfying three needs at the same time is not an easy task. However, a new trend has emerged in Changsha, which is transforming from a single production center to a space integrating production and life centers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Wang Fan’s view, the integration of production centers and life centers is the trend of the times. It requires more emphasis on people’s subjective initiative and responds to people’s demands. It reflects the concept of comprehensive, coordinated and sustainable development. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Guo Dongni, who was born in 1995, fell in love with Changsha&#39;s delicious food and friendly housing prices as early as when she was studying at Hunan University, and decided to stay in &quot;this happy city&quot; in the future. Nowadays, she is a professional and rigorous female engineer at work, but she is an energetic girl who loves hip-hop dancing in life. During her breaks, she drives to the Xiangjiang River to camp with her colleagues; The snack street is attractive, so you can enjoy a late-night snack. This is the energy given by fireworks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lu Chuang, born in the 1980s, seems to be living a parallel life with Guo Dongni. Fifteen years ago, Lu Chuang chose to come to Changsha for its educational resources and employment opportunities. While studying, whenever he was confused and confused, he would climb Yuelu Mountain alone. Sit for a while, the mountain will not speak, and the people will understand. Nowadays, he is not interested in commercial malls, but he still takes his family to visit his hometown from time to time to experience the changes in his mentality at different stages. This is the nourishment given by nature. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As mentioned above, after Hu Biliang returned to Changsha, he received strong support from the local talent policy. In the exchange with relevant leaders, he deeply felt the government&#39;s cherishment and respect for talents, and the carefulness and thoughtfulness of policy service talents. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Changsha City’s talent policy has really helped me solve some practical problems, especially the problem of children enrolling in school.” Hu Biliang said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2017, 22 items of Changsha’s talent policy were released; five years later, the “45-item upgraded version” of Changsha’s talent policy was released, proposing 45 policy points from 7 major aspects; two months later, The 26 supporting implementation measures of the New Deal have been upgraded again based on the original policies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From 22 to 45 and then to 26, there is no optimal, only better; there is no constant success in the credit book, only greater confidence and stronger determination. Practical welfare policies such as housing subsidies and tax rebates protect the rights and interests of talents and make it worthwhile for them. What this “two-way rush” achieves is double surprises for people and the city. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;People of different ages and personality traits have different definitions of ideal life, but they make the same choice. The only reasonable explanation is probably that this place meets most of the needs and imaginations of each individual. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The trend of integration and transformation from production center to life center has built Changsha’s “life-friendly” urban characteristics, while “life-friendly” continues to empower “R&amp;D-friendly” and “manufacturing-friendly”. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The talent policy is rich and comprehensive, the cost of living is low, public services such as medical education are high-quality, the cultural creativity is deep and dynamic, and the combination of various characteristics jointly builds a research and development space, a production space, a cultural space, A balanced and appropriate comprehensive urban system such as consumption space and cultural tourism space promotes the gathering of R&amp;D and innovative talents, and then intellectual achievements are born and transformed here, further promoting industrial transformation and upgrading, and forming a virtuous cycle of spiral advancement of industry and population. It will serve as a basis for improving urban supporting facilities and improving the quality of life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When talking about how to view the topic of &quot;Changsha building a global R&amp;D center city&quot;, Chen Ling said that Changsha will elevate the &quot;global R&amp;D center city&quot; to the level of the city&#39;s business card and carry out systematic development through policy measures. Comprehensive operation and layout will inevitably produce a brand effect and attract the attention of enterprises and talents. This approach is very consistent with the city&#39;s traditional image. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yes, Changsha has always been a city that encourages cultural creativity and tolerates emerging things. The spirit of leisure and entertainment and the atmosphere of human life rooted in the hearts of every citizen have led to the birth of Mango Channel, which dominates the prime time slots of satellite TV, and the birth of a number of new consumer brands such as Cha Yan Yuese and Wen He You. Its unique urban temperament and diverse tourism resources continue to attract a large number of tourists. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yuese Tea, a must-visit for tourists, recently announced an investment of 520 million yuan to build a brand R&amp;D and production base, focusing on product technology R&amp;D and product flavor R&amp;D. Compared with the secondary industry, the research and development link of the tertiary industry has a broader meaning, including not only the exploration of front-end products and technologies, but also product and service innovation in the terminal link, starting from the details to improve the consumer experience. In addition, Cha Yan Yuese also deeply explores the local culture of the city and promotes the spread of traditional tea culture and regional culture through packaging, logo, store design and many other elements. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wanxing, who proposed to &quot;get a salary as high as Shenzhen, live in a livable house in Changsha, and work in the global software industry&quot; is another example of Changsha&#39;s increased research and development in the creative field. In 2022, Wondershare&#39;s global operations headquarters and creative software global R&amp;D center will officially settle in Changsha. Additional investment in the 3.0 project has been initiated, and it is planned to build a &quot;Wanxing Creative World Industrial Park&quot; of nearly 100,000 square meters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Today, the &quot;double-sided Changsha&quot; image of culture, entertainment and hard-core manufacturing is connected by the link of &quot;research and development&quot;, forming a superimposed effect in the field of public opinion. Changsha welcomes research and development, regardless of track. , come if you dare. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Two transformations&quot; are going on at the same time, and the &quot;three friendships&quot; are interrelated. The innovative practices carried out in central China and their next steps will not only drive the rise of a new innovation center, but also influence The transformation of manufacturing cities is of exemplary significance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Changsha, which welcomes research and development, will also be welcomed in the future. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(Southern Weekend researchers Tang Jiale and Li Jing also contributed to this article)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br >;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/ a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 21 Sep 2023 10:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[合作25年，一朝决裂：石榴集团“宫斗”祸起境外架构]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257194]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-21 09:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/20/qYTwUTUzpFC3i0UZdd3SK9eiBsZFmeTTJ4JXWhsL.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/qYTwUTUzpFC3i0UZdd3SK9eiBsZFmeTTJ4 JXWhsL. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251285&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Pomegranate Group’s Beijing headquarters is located in the Fengtai Branch Center of Zhongguancun Science and Technology Park, also known as the Pomegranate Center. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Now both parties are retreating, guaranteeing the delivery of housing, protecting the interests of owners and investors, and not giving the government Cause trouble, so try not to occupy public issues anymore.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On September 15, 2023, a Southern Weekend reporter interviewed Cui Wei, chairman and major shareholder of Pomegranate Real Estate Group Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as Pomegranate Group) At that time, the company gave this reply. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At a media communication meeting held 4 days ago, Cui Wei knelt down in public, hoping that financial institutions would not withdraw loans due to the company’s chaos. If financial institutions cause real losses, I will jump from the 22nd floor of the Pomegranate Center where we are.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At this time, nearly three months have passed since internal strife broke out in this private real estate company, which ranks among the top 100 private real estate companies in China. During this period, incidents such as Cui Wei &quot;stealing the official seal&quot; and the dismissal of vice chairman and second shareholder Sang Chunhua frequently aroused public opinion. Sang Chunhua was also involved in a scandalous news. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After Cui Wei held a media communication meeting, Sang Chunhua also held a media communication meeting on September 14 and released a reconciliation signal at the meeting. He shouted to Cui Wei: &quot;I am still willing to give in and let you get more until we reach an agreement and stop the dispute.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The two sides have been at odds for some time. In 2021, Pomegranate Group failed to go public in Hong Kong. The next year, Sang Chunhua proposed a separation, believing that Cui Wei had not made the right decision in more than ten years and did not want to be held hostage again. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Cui Wei proposed that his equity would require a 30% premium when the company was separated, but Sang Chunhua refused to accept it. Conflicts accumulated over the years are about to break out. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Exposing each other&#39;s shortcomings&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In 2001, Cui Wei and Sang Chunhua cooperated to establish Beijing Agile Real Estate Development Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as Agile) in Beijing; in 2008 , the two parties also established Huamei K2 Real Estate Investment Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as Huamei K2), named after K2, the world’s second highest peak; in 2016, the company was renamed Pomegranate Group, aiming to be the “Apple in the real estate industry.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the more than 20 years since its establishment, Pomegranate Group has developed more than 90 projects in more than 30 cities across the country, focusing on mid-to-high-end residential products. At the press conference on September 11, Cui Wei once stated that the company has not had a single uncompleted building, a financial bad debt, or a bank overdue payment so far. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;How difficult it is to achieve such results, so why do we have to come out like this on June 21st?&quot; Sang Chunhua once shouted to Cui Wei from a distance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;That night, a drama of &quot;stealing for official seals&quot; was staged in the conference room on the 16th floor of the Pomegranate Group&#39;s office building. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the statement of a company employee signed by &quot;Zhang Yongkai&quot;, Cui Wei believed that &quot;Vice Chairman Sang Sir (Sang Chunhua hopes to be as capable and efficient as the Hong Kong police) has violated the company&#39;s system and affected the company&#39;s operations and other illegal acts &quot;, forcing members of the seal team, including Zhang Yongkai, to stamp documents that could not see the full text. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Afterwards, Cui Wei put the official seal into his pocket and said, &quot;Not only does he have to stamp it, but he also needs to take the seal home. This is his own company, he is the chairman, and this is his right. No one else can control it.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After struggling until 4 a.m., the members of the seal team were allowed to go home. From this day on, Pomegranate Group announced that Sang Chunhua would be terminated from his labor contract and all his duties. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Cui Wei said that the company’s dismissal of Sang Chunhua was legal and “a serious, legal and regulatory adjustment and defense of corporate governance rights.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The main reason for the dismissal of Sang Chunhua was that Sang arranged for relatives, classmates, fellow villagers, etc. to enter the company. The company was internally controlled by relevant interest groups. He was sidelined as the chairman, and the company&#39;s internal management and cost control were extremely chaotic. . Moreover, Sang had problems with his lifestyle, which caused damage to the company&#39;s goodwill. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On September 6, Liu Xia, CEO of Yunhe Variable Group, an investment company, reported Sang Chunhua on Weibo with his real name, saying that he invited many people to participate in unhealthy activities in Beijing on the pretext of eating. I was abused on WeChat and over the phone for dozens of minutes.&quot; It was later revealed that Li Guangtian, president of Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Shanghai regions of Pomegranate Group, and Ding Qingwei, president of Jiangsu region, were also involved. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On September 8, Sang Chunhua issued a statement saying: &quot;The dissemination of my unverified and untrue remarks by online platforms and individuals has seriously violated my right to reputation. I demand that the slander be stopped immediately.&quot; stigma, and reserves the right to pursue the legal responsibilities of online platforms and individuals. I have entrusted a lawyer to initiate relevant legal procedures.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Faced with Cui Wei&#39;s many accusations, Sang Chunhua also held multiple press conferences, Fight back against it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to disclosing the situation on June 21, Sang Chunhua claimed that the dismissal was without legal decision-making procedures of the company. He also accused Cui Wei to the media of improperly occupying company property and refusing to return it, and installing bugs in the vehicle he was riding in. device. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Also attending the press conference with Sang Chunhua on September 14 was Lin Xinwu, the former general manager of the Risk Control Center and Chairman of the Board of Supervisors of Pomegranate Group. He said that Pomegranate Group launched an A-share listing plan in 2016, and 62 core members paid in 216.8 million yuan as partners to participate in the share reform. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the A-share listing was blocked, Pomegranate turned to Hong Kong stocks in 2021, but still failed, and the partners’ funds were not returned. It wasn&#39;t until the official seal incident broke out on June 21 that Cui Wei, the working partner, &quot;collectively forced the wife to marry&quot;, asked for part of the money back. But the five partners, including him, were not only fired, but also did not receive refunds, totaling 33.5 million yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sang Chunhua also disclosed that Cui Wei had firmly refused to agree to dividends for 25 years, and the two borrowed money from the company when they needed it. In recent years, Cui Wei has borrowed hundreds of millions of yuan from companies in public names, and his whereabouts are unknown. Cui Wei also used company funds to speculate in Shougang stocks, resulting in a cumulative loss of 6 billion yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Cui Wei also accused Sang Chunhua of having &quot;huge and sudden&quot; external personal debts, endangering the company&#39;s operational security. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Apprentice or shareholder? &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Behind the back-and-forth attacks are actually hidden equity differences between the two parties. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Until August 4, Sang Chunhua still couldn’t enter the office. Downstairs of the company, he held a report on national enterprise credit information disclosure and introduced himself to the camera, saying that he was the director and general manager of Pomegranate Group and held 42% of the shares. The company has only two shareholders, with Cui Wei holding the other 58%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the camera, Sang Chunhua has short buzzcut hair and wears a pair of black-rimmed glasses. He called Cui Weilian twice, but no one answered. Then he dialed 110 and claimed to the police, &quot;I am the boss of this company and he has no right to fire me.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, after the shareholding of Pomegranate Group was penetrated, it was two companies registered in Hong Kong, and the national enterprise credit system could not see the shareholding status of the two. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, Pomegranate Group went public in Hong Kong in 2021. The prospectus obtained by Southern Weekend reporters shows that the company has established an overseas equity structure, with Cui Wei holding 57.42% of the shares, Sang Chunhua holding 41.58%, and investors Chen Jianyong holds 1% of the shares. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhang Yonggang has worked at Pomegranate Group for nearly ten years and is still working next to Sang Chunhua. He told Southern Weekend reporters that Chen Jianyong was a friend of Sang Chunhua. He withdrew his shares after the listing failed. Now Cui Wei and Sang Chunhua hold 58% and 42% of the company&#39;s shares respectively. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Due to the failure of listing, the prospectus of Pomegranate Group is currently invalid and cannot be viewed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the face of the media, Cui Wei, a former geography teacher, always calls Sang Chunhua his &quot;best student&quot;, &quot;just like Cao Yunjin to Guo Degang.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He said that he went overseas as a state-owned enterprise in 1993 and founded CITIC Real Estate Brokerage Company in Nanjing the following year (Editor’s note: public information cannot be found) and engaged in second-hand housing real estate brokerage. In 1998, he recruited Sang Chunhua, who was 20 years and 4 months old. At that time, Sang had no real estate sales experience and his monthly salary was 300 yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It was the World Cup in France that year. One night, Sang Chunhua was watching the game alone in the store when he met the owner Cui Wei who came to inspect the store. The two chatted for a long time while watching the game. Choi is 10 years older than Sang. After that, the two went to Qingdao and Beijing together to gradually expand the company. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Cui Wei said that it was not until he transformed the sales agency business into a demutualized company and donated part of his shares to Sang Chunhua free of charge that Sang became a shareholder. Subsequently, the company entered the real estate development business, and he transferred the shares of the sales agency company held by Sang into the development company, and successively granted him the positions of general manager and vice chairman. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Today, the share split is regarded by Cui Wei as a huge mistake, laying the foundation for today&#39;s disputes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But Sang Chunhua did not accept Cui Wei&#39;s statement that he was a student and an employee. He claimed that in the past 25 years, &quot;two people started a business and started from scratch.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the press conference on September 14, Sang Chunhua introduced that he started working in 1996. When he met Cui Wei in 1998, he was already the sales director of a real estate company in Nanjing, doing first-hand housing business. , and it was he who mobilized Cui Wei, who was still doing second-hand housing at the time, to enter first-hand housing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to Sang Chunhua, when they went north to start a business in Qingdao, the two had already determined the equity ratio of 70:30. In 2001, the Shandong team was disbanded, and he and Cui Wei came to Beijing again and registered Agile in the same year. At that time, we negotiated shares in Henderson Center and finally reached a ratio of 58:42. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;The so-called gift of shares is nonsense, and not paying for it is even more of a joke.&quot; Sang Chunhua said bluntly. Zhang Yonggang provided Agile&#39;s industrial and commercial information to Southern Weekend reporters, which showed that the company&#39;s registered capital was 10 million, with Cui Wei investing 5.8 million yuan in currency and Sang Chunhua investing 4.2 million yuan in currency. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhang Yonggang told Southern Weekend reporters that in 2008, Cui Hesang established Huamei Qiaogoli and transferred the shares of Agile. The ratio of 58:42 was still maintained, which was the predecessor of Pomegranate Group. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the press conference on September 14, Sang Chunhua said that on September 8, he took the initiative to interview Cui Wei and proposed to end the dispute, but the other party insisted on a 30% premium from the major shareholder. &quot;We still have to grab it.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Trouble with overseas structures&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The reason why Pomegranate Group has corporate governance chaos is because it involves overseas structures. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sang Chunhua pointed out that Cui Wei did not agree to dismantle the overseas structure after the company failed to go public in 2021. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Qichacha shows that Pomegranate Group is 100% owned by Beijing Minjiang Technology Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as Minjiang Technology). The latter’s legal representative is Cui Wei. After the equity penetration, it is owned by two Hong Kong companies. The Hong Kong company is in turn held by a company registered in the British Virgin Islands. Under this offshore structure, neither of the two major shareholders directly holds shares in the country. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Equity lawyer Lu Qinghua once represented equity disputes similar to those of Pomegranate Group and authored the book &quot;Corporate Control&quot;. She analyzed to Southern Weekend reporters that the domestic company Pomegranate Group is 100% owned by Minjiang Technology, and Cui Wei, the legal representative of Minjiang Technology, has the right to decide the candidates for the board of directors of Pomegranate Group. In the absence of special provisions in the company&#39;s articles of association, the legal representative also has the right to manage the official seal. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since August 2023, the management of Pomegranate Group has undergone a major change. After dismissing Sang Chunhua and Lin Xinwu, the company added four directors and one supervisor within one day. According to Sang Chunhua, the new directors include Cui Wei’s wife, Zhu Yanhua, who was appointed without his consent as the second shareholder. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Lu Qinghua’s view, under the overseas equity structure, Sang Chunhua does not directly hold shares of Pomegranate Group. This means that even if Sang Chunhua sues Cui Wei to dismiss him without going through legal procedures, it will be more difficult to win the case. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zheng Zhigang, a professor at the School of Finance at Renmin University of China who focuses on corporate governance research, holds a different view. He told Southern Weekend reporters that the ownership structure must ultimately restore the individuals who actually invested and reflect the true wishes of the investors. The appointment and removal of company directors require the approval of a majority of shareholders. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, he also agreed that if litigation is involved under an overseas structure, the actual legal effect of overseas awards may face challenges, and the litigation process may be a difficult tug-of-war. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zheng Zhigang introduced that the disputes at Pomegranate Group reflected some common issues in the governance of private enterprises. Many private enterprises focus on investment in the early stages of entrepreneurship. The founders are independent of each other and are maintained by family ties, friendships, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the company becomes bigger, some companies fail to handle the problem of profit distribution through institutional methods such as equity and compensation, or do not pay attention to the formation of a standardized corporate structure by introducing external investors. Problems caused by corporate governance often As a result, it is difficult for its business to last forever. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Affected by the dispute, Pomegranate Group began to face the risk of bank loan withdrawals. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Industrial Bank took the lead in sending a notification letter to Pomegranate Group, requiring it to deposit the remaining 74 million yuan of principal and interest repayable for this year on a 1.8 billion yuan loan into a supervisory account before August 12, 2023. Otherwise, Industrial Bank has the right to declare all loans to expire early and hold the borrower and guarantor responsible for breach of contract. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Pomegranate Group’s 2022 corporate bond annual report shows that as of the end of 2022, Pomegranate Group’s total interest-bearing liabilities were 16.678 billion yuan. Among them, bank loans within one year were 375 million yuan, and trust borrowings within one year were 1.146 billion yuan. A total of three interest-bearing bonds are in existence, with a total amount of 2.916 billion yuan, all of which will mature in 2024. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, as of the end of 2022, Pomegranate Group’s monetary funds were only 2.864 billion yuan, of which 536 million yuan was a restricted amount. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(At the request of the interviewee, Zhang Yonggang is a pseudonym in the article.
