Photo by Southern Weekend reporter Zhao Jilin&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From bank president to &quot;scammer&quot;, Zhang Shihe&#39;s life has been like a roller coaster. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhang Shihe is a native of Shangshui County, Zhoukou City, Henan Province, and the former vice president of a commercial bank in the county. After retirement, he joined the Henan Elderly Cultural Development Foundation (hereinafter referred to as the &quot;Old Foundation&quot;) and was responsible for collecting private funds from the county. In the eight years he witnessed, people were able to get their principal and interest back as scheduled. Until August 2021, no more money could be withdrawn, and savers began to &quot;visit&quot; every now and then. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At dawn on October 24, 2023, the first guest welcomed into Zhang Shihe’s home was 69-year-old Zhang Fenglan. Six years ago, she deposited the 100,000 yuan she had saved for most of her life into the Lao Foundation and became a &quot;five-star member.&quot; Zhang Shihe is the person in charge. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhang Fenglan’s reminder voucher is not a passbook or an IOU, but two membership certificates. The issuing organization is the Old Foundation. If you deposit money to it, you will receive consolation money, which is interest. In Shangshui County, for every 10,000 yuan saved, you can get 570 yuan/year in consolation payment, with an annualized rate of return of 5.7%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“I thought I had saved my money in the safest place, but I never imagined that something like this would happen.” Zhang Fenglan sighed repeatedly to the Southern Weekend reporter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhang Shihe persuaded the other party in a low voice, saying that he was also a victim and felt very guilty for &quot;losing&quot; everyone&#39;s money. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He revealed that the entire Shangshui County involves more than 300 depositors, with a total of more than 41 million yuan in deposits. Looking at the entire Henan Province, the tentacles of the Old Foundation are everywhere. Several insiders of the old foundation revealed to Southern Weekend reporters that the old foundation may absorb as much as 500 million yuan in depositors&#39; funds in Henan Province, involving 18 offices in Zhoukou, Nanyang, Luohe, Luoyang and other cities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 20, 2023, the Henan Provincial Department of Civil Affairs mentioned in its reply to Li Yazhong and others’ letter of complaint that in June 2020, the Henan Provincial Department of Civil Affairs transferred Henan Herong Industrial Group Co., Ltd. ( (hereinafter referred to as &quot;Herong Group&quot;) suspected illegal financing-related materials were handed over to the Henan Provincial Public Security Department in the name of the Lao Foundation. The official website of the Henan Provincial Department of Civil Affairs also records that on July 28, 2020, the Lao Foundation was included in the list of social organizations with serious violations of laws and breach of trust. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many heads of old foundations confirmed to Southern Weekend reporters that under the guidance of the Henan Provincial Public Security Department, public security bureaus in many places have launched investigations into county-level old foundations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In late October, Southern Weekend reporters visited several counties and districts in Zhoukou and Luohe cities and found that the Lao Foundation used local political and private network resources to weave a huge deposit-absorbing network. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;How did a provincial public foundation “self-raise” such huge sums of money in the past ten years? Where do these huge sums of money ultimately go? &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;Network&quot; retired cadres and farmers&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;How to become a veteran foundation member? A &quot;Membership Instructions&quot; found by Southern Weekend reporters states that applicants fill out the membership application form, and after review and approval by the Old Foundation, register information and pay membership fees. After receiving the membership card, they become a formal member. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhang Shihe said that these membership fees will be returned to members when they expire (one year), and you can also receive consolation money by presenting your membership card to the issuing agency. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Membership fees are essentially deposits, and the amount is replaced by points on the membership card. Members are divided into one-star, three-star and five-star, and the corresponding points represent RMB 10,000, RMB 30,000 and RMB 50,000. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The 82-year-old Lu Zhiqiang is a big customer of the old foundation and has 22 membership cards in his hand. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He is a retired cadre in Shangshui County. He has a monthly pension of more than 3,000 yuan, plus a front-end house, and an annual rent of more than 30,000 yuan. He and his wife cannot spend this money. How many. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He recalled that in the early days of the establishment of the Lao Foundation, Chen Zhihong, the person in charge in Shangshui County, often invited people to have dinner together to promote the Lao Foundation in order to build momentum. As a fellow villager, he even participated once. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Because it is a public foundation, I think there is no problem. Even if you deposit money in a bank for a fixed term, you don&#39;t have much money.&quot; He remembers Chen Zhihong motivating him like this, &quot;This foundation is managed by the Civil Affairs Department, so it can&#39;t be wasted.&quot; . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lu Zhiqiang hid the deposits of the old foundation from his children, not even his wife. &quot;If you tell them, they will stop it.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Guo Fenghua, 77, is the former head of the financial section of the Shangshui County Industrial and Commercial Bureau. She has deposited 250,000 yuan in the old foundation. She only learned about the old foundation through the introduction of a retired cadre from the Shangshui County Civil Affairs Bureau. &quot;I only knew that the interest rates were high and the certificates issued had the seal of the Civil Affairs Department, so I thought it was more reliable.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I didn&#39;t dare to tell my child at that time, for fear of exposing that my child was asking for the money. I wanted to save it so that I could hire a nanny when I get old.&quot; Guo Fenghua sighed, &quot;It&#39;s too late to regret it now. ”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to retired cadres in the county, the Lao Foundation has also extended its tentacles to the vast rural areas of Henan Province. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Shang Fugui, 70, is from Chengding Village, Guxiang Township, Linying County, Luohe City. He is responsible for helping the Lao Foundation collect deposits in the village. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He recalled to Southern Weekend reporters that at first the villagers saved little money, &quot;but because of the high interest rates, you saw me saving, I saw him saving, and word spread slowly.&quot; Some villagers even offered to give him cigarettes in order to do something for him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He absorbed 2.75 million yuan in funds, involving about 40 depositors, accounting for half of the village&#39;s population. There are also a few savers from other villages who are his relatives. Shang Fugui said that for every 10,000 yuan deposited, depositors can receive a condolence payment of 600 yuan per year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Actually, we are a small bank down there.” A head of the county-level office of the old foundation told a Southern Weekend reporter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Luohe, the old foundation showed the first signs of trouble. In October 2015, the Provincial Lao Foundation said that its funds were broken and gradually stopped local principal and interest payments. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Shang Fugui recalled that after the payment was stopped, the depositors became enemies with him. Seven years later, in October 2022, he was beaten once by villagers. &quot;Sometimes the tricycles are not dared to be released outside. They will poke holes in you and vent your anger.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Every Spring Festival, Shang Fugui and his wife would run to the city. &quot;What if I don&#39;t run away? They all gather at the door of my house to ask for money.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;A depositor has as many as 22 membership cards.

Photo by Southern Weekend reporter Zhao Jilin&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Using &quot;volunteers&quot; as the starting point&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Intermediaries such as Zhang Shihe and Shang Fugui are called &quot;volunteers&quot; in the old foundation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;They are often retired cadres or former loan officers. Their personal status provides credit endorsement to local people. Choosing such a group of &quot;hands-on&quot; is also a reason why similar foundations can always grow rapidly among the people. One of the &quot;mysteries&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The second floor of No. 8 Zhengxin Street, Shangshui County, Zhoukou City is the local office of the Old Foundation. When Southern Weekend reporters visited on October 23, the place was deserted and the door was locked. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhang Shihe said that there are five &quot;volunteers&quot; in the office, basically all retired cadres. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among them, Chen Zhihong is the person in charge of the Shangshui County Lao Foundation. He once served as secretary of the Party Committee of Tangzhuang Township in Shangshui County and deputy director of the Propaganda Department of the Shangshui County Party Committee. Zhang Shihe is the former vice president of a commercial bank in Shangshui County. The other two &quot;volunteers&quot; have served in the Shangshui County Finance Bureau and the Procuratorate respectively. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A former staff member of Weiji Township Government in Shangshui County told Southern Weekend reporters that he and Chen Zhihong are fellow villagers. I often sit at the same table with Chen Zhihong during meetings in the county. I am familiar with her, so I also saved some money. &quot;He is not like a liar, he is a very down-to-earth person.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In a criminal verdict obtained by Southern Weekend reporters, Yang Yiting, a &quot;volunteer&quot; at the Linying County Office in Luohe City, mentioned in his testimony that the old man When the foundation&#39;s Linying office was established, the director of the office, Xue Xiaoge, came to him and said that the provincial old foundation hoped to find a local cadre with prestige, good popularity, and retired cadre to serve as the honorary director. &quot;The foundation is engaged in charity. Shang Qi had been retired at home for two years and wanted to do something.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xue Xiaoge confessed that Yang Yiting was the former political commissar of the Linying County Public Security Bureau and the honorary director. &quot;When there is an event, he takes part in it. He doesn&#39;t usually go to work.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to retired cadres from government agencies, former rural loan officers are also an important force for the old foundation to sink into the rural market. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;70-year-old Feng Junfu is a villager in Guzhuang Village, Daguo Town, Linying County, Luohe City. In 1975, he was elected as a loan officer of Daguo Township Credit Union by the Guzhuang Village Committee and worked there for 34 years until 2009. Get fired. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Feng Junfu said that township residents are accustomed to depositing funds in local rural credit cooperatives or township banks, and loan officers play the role of handling business for villagers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Loan officers must first be ideologically progressive, trustworthy by the people, and have no stains.” Feng Junfu told Southern Weekend reporters that there are 20 old foundation “volunteers” in Linying County, most of whom have worked as loan officers in township banks. , and people from all over the country regard them as their &quot;own people&quot; who are worthy of entrustment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In March 2013, Xue Xiaoge found Feng Junfu and showed him the approval document of the old foundation from the Henan Provincial Department of Civil Affairs, the foundation’s legal person certificate, tax registration certificate, organization code certificate, etc., saying that it was formal. organization and invite him to join. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“The most important thing is that we have depositor resources in our hands.” Feng Junfu told Southern Weekend reporters that he thought about staying in his old business and the process was roughly the same, so he readily agreed. In Guzhuang Village, Feng Junfu developed more than 50 villagers into members of the Lao Foundation and collected a total of 1.85 million yuan in savings. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Provincial Veterans Foundation stipulates that for every 10,000 yuan taken in, 300 yuan will be set aside for &quot;volunteers&quot; and another 200 yuan will be used for office expenses of the county and district offices. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Origined from the Henan Song Qing Ling Foundation&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Tracing back to the source, the old foundation is inextricably linked to the Henan Soong Ching Ling Foundation (hereinafter referred to as the &quot;Henan Song Qing Ling Foundation&quot;). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As early as 2005, the Henan Song Foundation collected deposits from villagers in the name of public welfare medical insurance. (See Southern Weekend’s September 2011 series of reports on “Where is the Money of China’s Most Fundraising Charitable Organization—Who Controls the Henan Soong Ching Ling Foundation”)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In February 2013, the old foundation officially It was established and Lu Dawei was appointed as the president. According to the Henan Provincial People&#39;s Government website, Lu Dawei served as assistant to the governor. In addition, Southern Weekend reporters learned from the Henan Song Foundation website that he is also the vice chairman of the Henan Song Foundation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A county-level person in charge of the old foundation revealed that the management method of the old foundation is under the leadership of the president, with the secretary-general taking responsibility. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The person in charge told Southern Weekend reporters that Guo Jianxin is the secretary-general of the Old Foundation and is responsible for the overall work, while the deputy secretary-general Huang Yuejun is responsible for specific work. &quot;Huang Yuejun turned out to be from the Song Foundation. Basically, we follow the management style of Song Foundation, otherwise we wouldn’t be able to get this thing done.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In interviews with reporters from Southern Weekend, we found that most of the county-level directors of the old foundations had working experience in the Henan Song Foundation. After the Henan Song Foundation&#39;s savings-absorbing business ceased, Guo Jianxin and Huang Yuejun recruited these people. &quot;In the past, we were all familiar with the business at the Song Foundation. Huang Yuejun gave us advice and introduced us to the old foundation,&quot; the person in charge said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 30, a reporter from Southern Weekend contacted Huang Yuejun by phone. The other party said that he had left the Lao Foundation at the end of 2015 and was currently residing in a nursing home in Sichuan Province. He did not know much about the past and then hung up. Disconnect the phone. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu Cuiyun was originally a depositor of the Henan Song Foundation. After the Song Foundation ceased its deposit-taking business, she withdrew the original 100,000 yuan from the Song Foundation and transferred it to the old foundation. Then save another 50,000 yuan every year until 450,000 yuan. &quot;Generally (every year) I don&#39;t ask for the principal, I get the interest, but I add some money to make up 50,000 and deposit it again.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Left-hand foundation, right-hand open Company&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Tianyancha shows that the Elderly Foundation is located in Zhengzhou City, Henan Province, and its purpose is to &quot;promote the development of social welfare, culture, sports, education and other undertakings for the elderly in Henan Province.&quot; Access to the foundation’s official website is currently closed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporters obtained a reply from the Henan Provincial Department of Civil Affairs on the establishment and registration of the Henan Provincial Elderly Cultural Development Foundation (Yu Min Han [2013] No. 47). According to the &quot;Foundation&quot; According to the provisions of the Management Regulations, after review, the old foundation, which was donated a total of 4 million yuan as the original fund by Guo Jianxin, meets the conditions for establishing a public foundation. It is hereby approved to register and obtain the legal person status of the foundation in accordance with the law. Its business supervisory unit is Henan Provincial Department of Civil Affairs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In November 2023, Southern Weekend reporters repeatedly contacted the Henan Provincial Department of Civil Affairs to verify many issues regarding the old foundation, but no one answered the relevant calls. Inquired through &quot;12345&quot;, but still no reply after waiting for many days. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For many savers, they are willing to deposit money in the foundation. On the one hand, they trust the &quot;volunteers&quot;, and on the other hand, they see the business scope on the foundation&#39;s legal person registration certificate. On this certificate issued by the Henan Provincial Department of Civil Affairs, the business scope reads &quot;raising social funds in accordance with the law and carrying out elderly cultural activities such as loving and helping the elderly.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the eyes of many savers and &quot;volunteers&quot;, being able to &quot;raise social funds in accordance with the law&quot; means that they can legitimately accept deposits. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A search shows that many foundations do mention &quot;raising social funds in accordance with the law&quot; in their business scope. For example, the business scope of the Henan Province Yellow River Cultural Foundation is “raising funds in accordance with the law, rescuing cultural heritage, and establishing cultural undertakings”; the business scope of the Henan Province Youth Entrepreneurship and Employment Foundation is “raising funds in accordance with the law, subsidizing youth entrepreneurship and employment, and conducting research on youth entrepreneurship, etc. &quot;Related social charity activities&quot;; the business scope of the Henan Province Old District Construction Foundation is &quot;raising funds in accordance with the law and supporting poverty alleviation&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lawyer Zeng Jie of Guangdong Guangqiang Law Firm told Southern Weekend reporters that there is an essential difference between raising funds and deposits. Deposits mean a commitment to guarantee principal and interest. “The foundation can absorb funds from the society within its business scope. However, returns cannot be promised, and projects that repay principal and interest are not allowed.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He explained that deposit business requires a formal banking license. The old foundation used consolation money instead of interest without approval, which is a disguised form of absorbing savings. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;The business scope on the registration certificate makes depositors and volunteers think it is &quot;natural&quot; to save money here.

Photo by Southern Weekend reporter Zhao Jilin&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On November 29, 2021, the Linying County Court of Luohe City convicted the Henan Elderly Cultural Development Foundation of illegally absorbing public deposits, sentenced it to a fine of RMB 200,000, and ordered the elderly to Participants in the foundation&#39;s compensation fund-raising raised 29.71 million yuan, and Henan Herong Industrial Group Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as &quot;Herong Group&quot;) bears joint liability for compensation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What is the relationship between Herong Group and the Lao Foundation? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As the secretary-general of the Lao Foundation, Guo Jianxin is also the chairman of Henan Herong Elderly Care Industry Group and was once the major shareholder of Herong Group. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tianyancha shows that Herong Group was established in 2010 and is an enterprise mainly engaged in business services. On March 15, 2010, Guo Jianxin, as the major shareholder, participated in 90% of the shares for the first time. Another shareholder, Wang Shuling, is also a member of the board of directors of the Lao Foundation and holds 10% of the shares. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;To put it bluntly, Herong Group and the Lao Foundation are one and the same to the outside world, but in reality they are the same.&quot; A person close to Guo Jianxin told Southern Weekend reporters that there are people under the Lao Foundation and Herong Group. Division of labor, top management is a group of people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The registered office address of Herong Group is also the same as that of the Old Foundation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On March 5, 2013, the Lao Foundation and Herong Group officially signed a letter of authorization. The Lao Foundation will authorize Herong Group to invest in projects with the raised funds to ensure the maintenance and appreciation of the funds. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;An investigation by Southern Weekend reporters found that in order to avoid supervision, most of the private funds absorbed by the old foundation went through personal accounts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As can be seen in a criminal verdict, the financial personnel of the Provincial Veterans Foundation are Zhang Xiaodan and Wang Jie. Wang Jie is responsible for receiving funds (resigned in September 2015), and Zhang Xiaodan is responsible for disbursing funds. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhang Xiaodan mentioned in his testimony that the Provincial Veterans Foundation has bank cards in its offices in various counties and districts. The bank card account names are all the names of provincial and ministerial personnel, and most of the funds are transferred through China Construction Bank. Yes, a small part is transferred through ICBC and Postal Savings Bank of China. After the various offices in the county and district paid dues, Wang Jie transferred the money to the Herong Group&#39;s account. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Wang Jie swiped directly from the POS machine at the foundation headquarters and transferred it to the account given by Herong Group.&quot; Zhang Xiaodan saw Wang Jie transfer like this with his own eyes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhang Xiaodan said that the foundation transfers the dues transferred from each office to Herong Group. &quot;This is the case every day.&quot; Any money received is transferred to the company and transferred to his personal bank card. superior. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Judging from the available annual reports of the old foundation, from 2014 to 2016, the donation income was 300,000 yuan, 460,000 yuan, and 270,000 yuan respectively, and the corresponding public welfare expenditures were 25,000 yuan. Ten thousand yuan, 220,000 yuan, 360,000 yuan. But by 2017, both donation income and public welfare expenditures were 0. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This means that the huge &quot;membership dues&quot; of the old foundation did not go through the foundation&#39;s public account, but were transferred privately through personal bank accounts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;If a lawsuit is filed and we check the public account of the Old Foundation, we will find that there is no money from us in the account. The public account of the Old Foundation only accepts donations. Depositors&#39; money cannot be added to it. Even if it’s a donation,” a county-level head of an old foundation told a Southern Weekend reporter. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Huge sums of money flow into real estate&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;From a province-wide perspective, the difficulties faced by the old foundation in repaying funds are concentrated in the second half of 2021. But there are early signs of bank-run difficulties. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2014, guarantee companies and investment companies in Henan Province went bankrupt on a large scale. &quot;As soon as they closed down, the old foundation was also affected.&quot; An insider close to Guo Jianxin told Southern Weekend reporters that one year after the establishment of the old foundation, the capital chain began to break. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The person revealed that from August to September 2015, depositors began to withdraw money from the county offices of the Old Foundation on a large scale. &quot;Not only the customers were panicked, but the directors and volunteers of the Old Foundation offices were also panicked.&quot; . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A person in charge of a county-level office recalled that in October 2015, Guo Jianxin, the head of Herong Group, said at a meeting with county-level leaders that the company had debts and that the funds could not be paid temporarily. , let everyone go back and wait, and protect themselves first. &quot;We didn&#39;t tell the depositors when we got back, thinking it would be fine after a while.&quot; In order to repay the interest to the depositors, we also asked relatives and friends for help, did not hesitate to borrow money, and even sold the house, paying more than 1 million yuan in interest to the depositors. It wasn&#39;t until 2021 that he couldn&#39;t survive anymore, then he confessed to savers and stopped paying interest. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;There is no way, in order to encourage depositors to continue depositing. If we stop (payment), we will have to go to (jail). Will ordinary people be willing to not pay interest?&quot; The person in charge of the office said that if we continue to do so, Those who went down were paupers and were in debt. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On February 20, 2023, Herong Group issued the &quot;Explanation on the Inability to Redeem the Funds Raised by the Henan Elderly Cultural Foundation on Time&quot;, saying that it held a meeting to study and decide that the payment will be made from the end of February 2023. 10%-15% of the funds will be paid, and 20%-25% of the funds will be paid at the end of February 2024; 30%-35% will be paid in February 2025, and the rest will be paid at the end of 2025. However, the above promises have never been fulfilled. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Where did the money go? This is the mystery lingering in the minds of savers and &quot;volunteers&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yi Jiadong is the legal representative of Herong Group. He confessed in a criminal verdict that &quot;Herong Group invested in two real estate projects in Mengzhou City in Jiaozuo and Yuanyang County in Xinxiang , invested in an apartment project for the elderly in Zhengzhou Port District, and also invested in a real estate project in Shangqiu City. All the social funds raised by the Lao Foundation were used in these projects.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among them, the Zhengzhou Port District project is Herong International Health Care Demonstration Park (hereinafter referred to as &quot;Health Care Park&quot;) is considered to be the benchmark project of Herong Group. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Public information shows that Kangyangyuan is located at the southwest corner of the intersection of Yingang Avenue and Ruyun Road, Airport District, Zhengzhou City. The total land area is 41,398.22 square meters, the total construction area is 76,754.40 square meters, and there are 2,000 designed beds. It mainly constructs 6 elderly apartment buildings, 1 comprehensive service building, 1 elderly research center building, and 1 elderly medical care center building. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Feng Chunlai is the head of a county-level office of the Lao Foundation. On September 15, 2022, he was elected as the director of Kangyangyuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He revealed to Southern Weekend reporters that the elderly care projects in the port area are positioned as high-end and have received the attention of many local leaders. There is a lot of room for imagination in the future. In addition to construction subsidies, bed subsidies, and nursing subsidies, the land price also has advantages compared with other investors. &quot;I heard that the land price in Zhengzhou Port District was more than 2 million yuan per acre, but here it was only a few hundred thousand. At that time, the house price was 10% per year. growth, this alone will not make us lose anything.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, its construction was not smooth. Feng Chunlai said that the construction of Kangyangyuan started in 2016, but due to environmental problems such as dust and noise, the superior authorities asked it to stop construction. It was not until December 18, 2019 that the first phase of the park was successfully opened. According to the Henan branch of CCTV, Lu Dawei and Guo Jianxin also delivered speeches at the opening ceremony. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Feng Chunlai revealed that the main construction of the nine buildings of the senior care project in Zhengzhou Port District was completed in 2018, but due to financial constraints, there has been no renovation. At the beginning of 2019, eight county-level offices under the old foundation established project promotion teams to continue to collect deposits from the society and provide loans to renovate Buildings 5 ​​and 4. The remaining seven buildings have not yet been renovated due to funding problems. &quot;If we don&#39;t renovate the building, this place will collapse long ago.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Today, about 80 elderly people live in the No. 5 complex. However, as of now, the Kangyangyuan has not yet been inspected and has not obtained a business license. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Multiple people familiar with the matter confirmed to Southern Weekend reporters that in the second half of 2022, Guo Jianxin and several company managers were arrested by the public security organs for involvement in other cases. Subsequently, the offices of the Old Foundation and Herong Group were moved from No. 8 Shangdu Road, Zhengdong New District to Kangyangyuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;Now almost no one is working in the Old Foundation and Herong Group. They come if they have something to do, but they don&#39;t come if there is nothing. They basically go back to their homes.&quot; An insider of the Old Foundation said that No. 5 in Kangyang Garden The second floor of the complex building was originally the office space of the bosses, but now it is hard to find anyone. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 30, a reporter from Southern Weekend contacted an external relations director of Herong Group as an investor. He said that Kangyangyuan currently still has debts of more than 200 million yuan, of which the construction work is in arrears. The team&#39;s project payment is less than 100 million yuan, and the other more than 100 million yuan is funds collected from some elderly customers before the epidemic and needs to be refunded. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Feng Chunlai said that Kangyangyuan currently has 30 employees and spends 200,000 to 300,000 yuan a month. The largest expense is water and electricity bills. Although we can collect 3,700 yuan per month from each elderly person, &quot;it&#39;s basically not enough, and we are trying every means to delay and owe money.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Can this retirement apartment make money to replenish the principal of the old foundation’s depositors? They can&#39;t think that far ahead. At the moment, the operations here are barely surviving on the money of the elderly living in retirement apartments. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(At the request of the interviewee, Zhang Shihe, Zhang Fenglan, Lu Zhiqiang, Guo Fenghua, and Liu Cuiyun are pseudonyms in the article.)&lt;/p>; &lt;p >;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 08 Nov 2023 12:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[消失的课间十分钟，学校何以成樊笼：“绝对安全”发生学丨快评]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260132]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-08 11:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;In response to the &quot;disappearing ten minutes between classes&quot; for primary and secondary school students in some places, the Ministry of Education stated that it will resolutely correct it to &quot;ensure The practice of simply restricting students’ necessary recess and activities on the grounds of “student safety”. Subsequently, some schools began to respond, such as media reports: The bell rang, and Dang Xinlong, the vice principal of Shanhaitian Experimental Primary School in Rizhao, Shandong Province, kicked out the students who were still in the classroom. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, this chronic disease has been infiltrated for a long time, is widespread and deep, and I am afraid it cannot be cured by a single statement. Article 8 of the &quot;School Protection Regulations for Minors&quot; that will be implemented on September 1, 2021: Schools shall not set up management measures that infringe on students&#39; personal freedom, and shall not impose any restrictions on students&#39; legitimate communication, games, or activities during recess and other non-teaching time. Unnecessary restrictions are placed on freedom of speech and behavior such as classroom activities. The target is the &quot;disappeared ten minutes between classes&quot;. The problem is that it is difficult for students to make their own decisions. No school believes that it is &quot;unnecessary&quot; to restrict students from leaving the classroom, the teaching building, and the playground during recess. So, the problem remains to be solved. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Beiqing.com recently reported that a parent said: If children want to leave the classroom during recess, they can basically only go to the toilet and get water. They are not allowed to talk loudly or run or jump on the way; some &quot;loose&quot; schools , the child will be allowed to walk in the corridor and cannot go up or down stairs or to the playground; in more serious cases, the child can only stay in the corridor of his own group and cannot cross the boundary. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another media reported in July this year that in Beijing, primary schools generally strictly limit the scope and intensity of students’ recess activities. The reporter randomly visited 27 schools in the central city and found that at least more than 20 schools have strict restrictions on students’ recess activities. restrictions on activities during the period. In addition, some schools in Zhengzhou, Henan, Baoding, Hebei and other places have adopted similar regulations, including not being allowed to leave the teaching building, not leaving the classroom, and not allowed to speak loudly or play around inside or outside the classroom. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When I was a child born in the 70s and 80s, I could go out for ten minutes between classes to skip rope, play shuttlecock, hopscotch, play freely and even chase each other, letting go of my nature; outdoors, in the playground, be quiet or active No matter what, it is always suitable, with the blue sky above your head, your feet on the earth, let the sun hit your face, let the breeze blow on your face, and be close to nature, which can instantly rejuvenate and heal the body and mind, and also cultivate simple, strong and resilient character and values. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;And now, while restricting or even prohibiting children from leaving the classroom, leaving the teaching building, or going to the playground for even ten minutes between classes, they still naively ask: Why are our children so mentally fragile? Why are our boys so fragile? A general lack of masculinity? Isn&#39;t this funny? How can we become strong physically and mentally if we are not even allowed to chase, play and fight? Where does masculinity come from? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;How did this distorted philosophy and practice come to be? On June 1, 2021, the Director of the Department of Physical Health and Art Education of the Ministry of Education responded to CCTV: &quot;We are afraid that students will be easily injured once they move. Now all schools put safety first... This can also be said to be a failure to eat due to choking. .&quot; Viewed in this way, the pursuit of &quot;absolute safety&quot; and its mechanism are worthy of analysis and reflection. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First of all, some parents have problems and believe that the school should be responsible for any personal injury to their children while in school. This imposes unlimited liability on the school. Not to mention that schools can’t do it, parents themselves can’t do it either. Theoretically, there is no one in the world who is more concerned about the safety of their children than parents, but under the care of parents, there are endless incidents of children being injured or even killed. No one wants to see something like this happen, but the world itself contains various known and unknown risks, and we cannot make anti-human demands on schools. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Furthermore, identifying risks, preventing risks, responding to risks, and coexisting with risks are an integral part of everyone&#39;s life, and they are also the basic education that every child must learn to grow up. Very young children do not know what risks are. Of course, they must be kept away from risks and isolated as much as possible. However, children are constantly growing and need to learn the skills to identify, prevent and respond to risks as they grow. This is the most important survival skills education. In a way, it is much more important than knowledge education. And so many schools actually succumb to the ideas of some parents of students and strive to build schools into an absolutely safe space that is isolated from any risks. To this end, they do not hesitate to suppress children&#39;s love of freedom and love of play. This is anti-education in itself and also In vain. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Secondly, there will always be some weird parents who want to blackmail the school financially when their child has an accident at school, even though it is clearly not the school’s responsibility. But this is not the crux of the problem. The key lies in how schools, education authorities, public prosecutors and law respond. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If these three parties can handle the matter according to its merits and legal principles, it will not be the responsibility of the school. The school will not shoulder the responsibility, and the school will not let the school shoulder the responsibility. He Xini will resolutely fight back those who mess around. In this way, righteousness can rise and decent values ​​and correct incentives can be established. Does the school still need to engage in &quot;absolute security&quot; that is anti-education and anti-human? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Obviously it was not the school’s responsibility, but due to the parents’ unreasonable fuss, the school had to compensate the loss on its own or under the pressure of superior departments. This is a bad incentive for some parents who have evil intentions or like to shirk responsibility. In order to avoid another hemorrhage, the logical approach for schools and education authorities is to restrict children&#39;s freedom of movement, confine them to the smallest possible space, and approach the &quot;absolute safety&quot; that isolates all risks. This is the root of the problem. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To a certain extent, this is a social issue and a conceptual issue: children who cry have milk to drink. Whoever has a louder voice and can make more noise will get greater benefits. This phenomenon is still prevalent in public opinion and in all walks of life. &quot;I am weak and I am reasonable&quot;, &quot;I am making trouble and I am justified&quot; and &quot;I am loud and I am justified&quot; have become unspoken rules. Pretending to be weak, being miserable, and using the weak to bully the strong has created another jungle. The children locked up in the classroom are just another group of victims of this jungle law. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 08 Nov 2023 11:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[记者节之思：新闻理想的坚守与开拓]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260074]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-08 10:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;The annual Journalists’ Day is here. This is also the time for reporters who are working non-stop and running around all year round to stop and reflect. , an important moment for self-examination. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Today&#39;s world is full of chaos, the century-old changes are accelerating, the media field is deeply integrated and reconstructed, instability and uncertainty factors are significantly increasing, internal and external factors are stirring in the hearts of journalists... At this moment, Journalists&#39; Day, Perhaps each of us journalists should ask themselves the question: Do you still have journalistic ideals? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For a journalist, the news ideal is the &quot;beacon light&quot; that guides the direction; the news ideal is the &quot;engine&quot; that drives forward; the news ideal is the &quot;ballast&quot; &quot;Stone&quot; has the function of calming the mind; news ideal is the &quot;regulator&quot; and has the function of prompting and warning. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, today, the traditional journalism industry is facing an unprecedented industry shock: the circulation of newspapers and periodicals and radio and television ratings have declined, and the influence of the media has declined; the media industry has operating difficulties, and the income of news practitioners has decreased. ; The number of people leaving their jobs has increased, and people quitting the industry have been heard from time to time; the number of enrollment in journalism and communication majors in colleges and universities has been reduced, and the employment situation of graduates has become tighter... There is no shortage of comments on the Internet about candidates who plan to apply for the journalism and communication major. Although it is not without bias, This is by no means groundless. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the founding words of &quot;Xiangjiang Review&quot;, Mao Zedong enthusiastically asked: &quot;What is the biggest problem in the world? The biggest problem is the problem of food.&quot; When the traditional journalism industry is climbing up and over the hurdles, a group of people who are confused and emotionally anxious have emerged. Psychological Inevitability – Will Traditional Journalism Die? Is there a future for journalism? Do we still need journalistic ideals? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As long as we carefully study the history, reality and future development trends of journalism, we will find that traditional journalism will not disappear. Journalism still has its own future, and we still need journalistic ideals. This is because: From the perspective of the origin of journalism, news originates from people’s curiosity. As long as people’s curiosity does not die, journalism will not disappear. From the perspective of the evolution of the journalism industry, although the carrier of news is constantly changing, the functional role of journalism has not disappeared. However, compared with the traditional ways of reading newspapers, listening to radio, and watching TV in the past, people now obtain news in a different way. It’s just a new carrier such as a mobile phone. From the perspective of audience needs, news focuses on meeting people&#39;s communication needs. As long as people&#39;s communication needs exist, the demand for journalism will always exist. From the perspective of journalism production, the authoritative news, in-depth reports, news reviews, elegant programs and other products provided by traditional media cannot be replaced by the vast number of new media and self-media. Therefore, traditional journalism is unlikely to disappear in any of the above senses. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since it is impossible for traditional journalism to disappear, it is impossible for journalists to disappear. The ideal of journalism will inevitably accompany and advance together with journalists. Otherwise, we will lose our way and lose our way. Without motivation, lack of soul, and chaos, you will be at a loss, useless, muddle along, and do nothing.因此，置身于这样一个特殊的时代背景下，我们每一个新闻工作者依然要胸怀新闻理想、高扬新闻理想、坚守新闻理想、践行新闻理想。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;要常怀忠诚之心。忠诚，就是作为一个新闻工作者，不要问国家为我做了什么，而要问我为国家做了什么；忠诚，就是大事面前不糊涂、关键时刻不动摇，经得起各种复杂形势和问题的考验；忠诚，就是淡泊名利、甘当苦力，为新闻事业苦干、流汗、万里奔波，努力成为一个优秀的新闻工作者。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;要常葆敏锐之识。敏锐是专业新闻工作者的必备品质。新闻工作者只有头脑敏锐、眼光独到，善于见微知著、快速反应，拥有慧眼神笔，才能有效提升新闻舆论工作的传播力、引导力、影响力和公信力。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;要常练求真之功。世界著名记者法拉奇曾经说过：“记者的天职在于揭露真相。”在一个媒体林立的泛传播时代，尽管新闻信息过剩，但真实的新闻永远可贵。我们应该始终保持求真的精神，修炼求真的功夫，在波涛汹涌的海量信息世界中，及时迅速地为社会公众提供真相、真知、真情、真理。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;要常握公正之尺。有人说：“记者笔下有财产万千，有毁誉忠奸，有是非曲直，有人命关天。”可见记者这支笔的分量有多重。因此，我们记者对为什么写、写什么、怎么写、写到什么程度等问题应十分清楚，要时时把握好“公正”这个标尺，绝不能为某种权力、金钱和利益关系所左右。那些沾满了油水和酒水的笔是不可能做到公正的。这就是需要我们常常对“公正”保持敬畏之心的原因所在。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在记者节来临之际，祝每一位新闻工作者的新闻理想之树枝叶常青、永不凋零！ &lt;/p>;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;2018年10月，公安消防部队、武警森林部队退出现役，成建制划归应急管理部，组建国家综合性消防救援队伍。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;琼色表示，5年来，近20万队伍顺利完成转隶移交、身份转改、职级套改、授衔换装、落编定岗等工作，组建国家消防救援局，实行统一领导、分级指挥，明确中央主建、地方主用的重大原则，建立起条块结合、以条为主的双重管理体制。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;2023年是国家综合性消防救援队伍组建后公开招录消防员的第六年。应急管理部教育训练司负责人李尚余表示，2023年招录下达计划1.5万名，但有近11万人报名，连续第四次满额招录。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;李尚余介绍，新消防员平均年龄21.8岁，大学专科以上学历占52.6%，目前正在进行为期1年的入职训练。至此，转制后招录消防员总量达到9.4万余名，占现有消防员总数的65.3%。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;森林消防增编8200余名&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;国家消防救援局正式挂牌后新组建了机动队伍。国家消防救援局副局长徐忠舜表示，这是“着眼我国自然灾害多发频发的基本国情作出的重大决策”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;徐忠舜说，机动队伍作为国家急难重大灾害事故救援的攻坚力量，主要承担森林和草原灭火职责，辅以抗洪抢险和地震地质灾害救援职责，任务安排上侧重冬春灭火、夏秋抗汛、全年救灾，季节性跨区域驻防，实行前置备勤。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;国家消防救援局整合了森林消防总队及相关消防救援机动支队，组建10个跨区域消防救援机动总队和若干支队、大队、中队。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;其中，森林消防队伍原有编制2.5万名，主要部署在内蒙古、吉林、黑龙江、福建、四川等10个省份。在此基础上，中央编办为森林消防队伍核增编制8200余名，主要加强全国重点林区、国家公园和七大流域抗洪抢险及其周边地区的一线消防救援机动力量，实现对31个省级行政区域的“全覆盖”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;徐忠舜表示，截至目前，第一批增编组建机动队伍中17个省份已基本完成进驻，现正在组织向第二批增编组建的3个省份派驻队伍。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;“全灾种、大应急” &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;消防救援队伍改革转制之后，职能也有所拓展。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;琼色介绍，国家消防救援局在原有的火灾扑救和以抢救人员生命为主的抢险救援的基础上，重点向“全灾种、大应急”的综合救援拓展，覆盖了城乡和森林草原火灾扑救以及洪涝、地震、地质、台风、建筑坍塌、危化品泄漏等灾害事故救援各领域。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;以2022年为例，全国消防救援队伍共接报处置各类灾情209.2万起，其中火灾扑救82.4万起、抢险救援46.9万起、各类社会救助59.7万起、公务执勤12.6万起、其他出动7.6万起。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;在这个救援总数中，火灾扑救仍然是消防救援队伍应对处置的主要事故类型。同时，水域、山岳、生产及设备故障、电梯被困、交通事故类警情占抢险救援总数的87.4%，“是抢险救援的主要类型，也是改革转制之后职能任务拓展的重点方向”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;琼色表示，针对这些情况，近年来，国家消防救援局大力加强专业力量建设，共组建了高层建筑、地下空间、大型商业综合体、石化企业火灾扑救以及地震、水域、空勤和雨雪冰冻等专业救援队伍3500余支，依托森林消防队伍建成12个特种灾害救援大队以及所属的55个快速反应分队。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 08 Nov 2023 09:25:02 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[中山二院乳腺外科多人患癌？医院通报]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260152]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-08 08:35:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;span>;2023年11月7日，我院关注到网络上有传播“中山二院乳腺外科团队疑受实验环境和试剂影响致多人患癌”等信息。医院迅速组织调查核实，初步了解到：近年在乳腺肿瘤中心实验室工作、学习过的人员中有3名罹患癌症，其中2名现为我院乳腺外科医生，在临床工作；另外1名不是我院职工或学生，为外地来院进修人员，已回原单位工作。该实验室无在读学生患癌。具体情况如下：&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;彭琪刚开始听到炮弹声和枪声时，并不知道那是什么声响，她以为有人在放烟花。2023年6月，她从瑞丽市区调到畹町镇，在一家连锁奶茶店当店长。本地人告诉她，那是缅甸打仗的声音，并安慰她：“没事的，我们年年都听得到这种声音。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;习惯了枪炮声的本地人，似乎也被这次的阵仗吓到了。10月29日凌晨两三点，沉睡中的吴霞被几声炮响惊醒。那一天，她听着外面的枪炮声，判断两方交火激烈，离她家两百米左右的一户人家的窗户被震碎了。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;吴霞小吃店里卖一些当地特色小吃，如泡鲁达、炒饵块等，距畹町口岸仅两百米左右。读小学三年级的孩子害怕炮弹会打穿铁皮，听到炮火声时就要回家。吴霞认为，躲在家里也不一定安全，“如果真有炮弹来了，哪里都躲不了”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;家住界河边的陶菀似乎风险更大，她曾在短视频平台刷到河对岸直升机正在轰炸的画面，小区管理员也一直叮嘱“都不要从家里出来”，但她在畹町镇卫生院工作，仍需到岗。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;陶菀向南方周末记者回忆，10月31日，她正在上班，突然被告知她家附近被炸出一个大坑，而读小学的儿子正一个人待在家里。“当时真是十万火急，我一边给丈夫打电话，一边往家里跑。到家打开门一看，儿子正好好地睡着午觉。”陶菀看着儿子熟睡的模样，感觉“心里面都要碎掉了”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;陶菀告诉南方周末记者，在她小时候，畹町镇也能听到对岸的打仗声，“枪弹声就像放炮仗一样，打几声也就没了，今年确实是最激烈的一年。”社区工作人员和街头广播让居民撤退避战的情景令陶菀感受到从未有过的恐慌，“觉得要离开这个家了”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;多位受访者告诉南方周末记者，在10月27日即战争爆发当天晚上，就有社区人员上门劝离：“如果有家人朋友在瑞丽的，就去瑞丽吧。”不仅如此，社区还通知，如果听到枪炮声，请大家不要外出，并立即寻找遮蔽物躲避，不要因好奇去观望，避免在空旷场地暴露身体，以免被流弹击中。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;11月3日，畹町镇政府一位值班人员告诉南方周末记者，政府大楼内的工作人员已经搬至相对安全的地方办公，只留下少数值班人员，新地方仍在畹町域内，距镇政府大楼有五六公里远。之所以搬离镇政府大楼，是因为大楼“正对面就是缅甸，有重大的安全隐患”。对于畹町镇共转移多少人、学生何时复课等问题，该值班人员表示不清楚。&lt;/p>;

&lt;h4>;西瓜生意链断了&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;生活在畹町的居民察觉此次战争与往常不同的信号，除了激烈的枪炮声外，还有学生全面停课。彭琪所在的奶茶店离畹町中学只有数百米，她发现10月27日周五晚上，原本周日放假的高中生也都被家长接回了家。吴霞的小吃店离这所中学也不远，她看到了很多家长把车开到校门口接学生回家。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在畹町长大的21岁女孩蔡莉莉回忆，前几年当地也曾有过一次因缅甸战乱而停课的紧急情况，但时间她已记不清楚，只记得当时也是有流弹飞到境内。“近几年比较严重的就是有流弹飞过来的这两次，缅甸局势一直都不太稳定，一旦开始战乱，畹町的地理位置注定了会被波及。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在蔡莉莉的印象中，仅隔着一条两三米宽的界河，畹町和对岸的缅甸棒赛镇交流频密。她回忆，在她五六岁时，从边境口岸去缅甸玩是一件很容易的事。在她读小学时，班上四十多名学生里，有七八个是缅甸籍，“我们学的都是中文课程，大家都在一起玩”。那条界河也是她的游乐地之一，她常和家人、朋友去河边钓鱼、野炊，一条步道紧贴着界河修建，畹町的居民常到河边散步。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;陶菀向南方周末记者证实，确实有畹町的居民被误伤，多是皮外伤。“我们清创以后会让他们赶紧回家，因为医院地势比较高，也不安全。也有一部分人被救护车转移到上级医院。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;吴霞发现，自缅北战争开始后，大街上的人越来越少，尤其是游客。作为边关名镇和边境口岸，这里常年游客不绝。她的小吃店因离国门不远，每天顾客约有百人。但战争爆发后，只有几个住在附近的老顾客到店光顾，“这一条街上都没人了”。不仅如此，10月30日，畹町镇中心区域施行“只出不进”规定。不过，据当地人透露，该规定只施行了两天。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;彭琪也明显感觉人流量骤减。11月2日16时，在接受南方周末记者采访时，彭琪称当天店里营业额只有一百多元，这是大概10杯奶茶的价钱，客人多是附近开商铺的。而在战争之前，店铺每天流水约有一千元。也有胆大的游客到边境线上拍摄短视频，吴霞说：“好些男男女女，可能也是害怕，他们基本都是拍了就走。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;吴霞看到的男男女女里，或许也有瓜贩周峰。11月2日，37岁的周峰也去畹町的国门转了转，但他此行的目的地是畹町西瓜批发市场。作为东南亚最大的西瓜市场，每年10月底至次年5月，是缅甸西瓜上市并出口到中国的时间段。周峰透露，在高峰期，市场一天可以出1000辆车，每辆车载重16吨西瓜。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2023年10月底，刚上市的缅甸西瓜每公斤价格可达四五元，并不算低。战争爆发后，畹町国门关闭，西瓜无法进入境内。周峰分析，西瓜这条产业链上最受影响的要数瓜农。缅甸承包土地价格较低，每亩只需三四百元，因此在缅甸包地种西瓜的多是中国人。周峰从事这一行业已有13年，他庆幸现在属于西瓜上市的早期，“要是再过一个多月打仗，那就恼火了”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;往年在畹町西瓜批发市场里，瓜摊堆满缅甸进口的西瓜。东方IC图&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/07/0f278c71c6.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;720&quot;

&lt;h4>;“安静得可怕”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;并非所有畹町居民都受到了战争影响。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;畹町镇辖区内有3个社区和3个行政村。26岁的郭宇和家人住在混板村，那里距边境口岸约5公里，离缅甸直线距离一两公里。郭宇经营一家民宿，自战争开始后，便没有客人入住。幸运的是，炮弹没有落到他们附近，一家人的衣食住行也没有受到影响。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;郭宇的妈妈是缅甸人，爸爸祖籍在云南省保山市，他们年轻时来到畹町买地建房，在此安了家。郭宇告诉南方周末记者，他外婆家没被战火波及，暂时较为安全。郭宇也自觉安全，并没有搬离的打算，但若炮弹炸到附近，一家人可能会搬去20公里外的瑞丽，到亲戚家借住。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;陶菀也不准备撤离，只是连夜将小儿子送回德宏州的丈夫老家。“我们买房买车都是靠自己，这是我的家，出去了就连根都不在了。”自10月27日以来，陶菀每天都感觉惶惶不安，她害怕万一发生意外房子没了。“我不知道那种情况下应该怎么办，一想到这种可能性，我的眼泪都要掉出来了。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;陶菀5岁跟着母亲来到畹町镇，如今已是40岁。因要照顾不愿离开畹町的母亲，在外地上大学的陶菀又回到了这里，直到现在。战争爆发后，陶菀将母亲安置到远离边境线的一处寨子里，她打算等战事平稳，再把老人接回家里。陶菀介绍，镇上有一些腿脚不方便的老人也不愿意搬离，他们对畹町有很深的感情。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在傣语中，畹町意为“太阳当顶的地方”。如今，这座小镇的光芒不再耀眼。在陶菀的印象中，二三十年前的畹町繁华昌盛，后因道路规划、行政区划等原因，畹町正在慢慢变得衰落。陶菀为自己生活的小镇感到委屈，“之前三年疫情，现在又有这个战争”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;蔡莉莉从没觉得自己是从小镇走出去的姑娘，她觉得畹町更像一座小型城市。她记得2007年左右，畹町镇特别热闹，人来人往，街上商铺会卖缅甸特产，如酸辣面、奶丝糖等。现在，一些让蔡莉莉印象深刻的店铺已经关门了，街上很多铺面空着。“近几年它没落后，我才慢慢觉得它好像真的只是一个小镇子。”蔡莉莉说。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;如今，这座小镇再次面临考验。11月6日，彭琪告诉南方周末记者，相较于前几天混乱的枪炮声，现在畹町的街道“安静得可怕”，除了偶尔路过的行人，街上只剩军绿色的卡车来回巡逻。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;陶菀近日也没听到枪炮声，但她感觉政府部门和学校并没有放松的迹象，学校仍未通知复课，教学以网课形式进行，社区依旧每天统计没有撤离的居民信息。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;（应受访者要求，文中人物均为化名）&lt;/p>;

&lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Albert Camus (November 7, 1913 - 1960 January 4), French writer and philosopher, born in Algeria. He won the Nobel Prize for Literature at the age of 44 and died unexpectedly at the age of 47. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On November 7, 1913, Albert Camus was born. On January 4, 1960, he died in an accidental car accident at the age of 46. Today, it has been 110 years since Camus was born and more than sixty years since his death, but people do not feel that Camus belongs to a distant era. He used his short writing career to create a series of distinctive contemporary images. , is still closely related to our living situation today. The embarrassment, discord, and sense of powerlessness of &quot;outsiders&quot;, the repeated hard labor in &quot;Sisyphus&quot;, and the struggle and dignity of people facing disaster in &quot;The Plague&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Camus is both a writer and a thinker. He does not capture readers with the splendor of his words, but shocks them with his postmodern understanding of life. He is the youngest winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature. one. Camus&#39;s enduring popularity is symptomatic. Just like Kafka, he wrote a &quot;clinical diagnosis&quot; of contemporary people&#39;s mental dilemma; just like Lu Xun, he does not provide bright answers, or even It&#39;s a bit dark and cold, but at the end of the coldness is a philosophy of resistance and hope. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Camus once worked as a journalist. On January 1, 1940, he wrote an editorial for the last issue of the &quot;Republican Evening News&quot;. You can get a glimpse of his restraint, coolness, and calmness with a sense of power. Words: &quot;This year, hoping for happiness will be in vain, building it through work is the key. Don&#39;t hope for anything, but do something. Don&#39;t wait for others to build your destiny from beginning to end, especially when destiny It is still in our hands. The Evening Republican will not wish you happiness this year, knowing that you are going through a severe physical and mental trauma. But it will ask you to maintain the necessary strength and sobriety to strive to maintain your own tranquility and dignity. .&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It was the darkest moment of World War II. Shortly after Camus wrote this dedication, while fleeing on the border of France and Spain, Benjamin failed to get a pass and came to the end of his life. At the end, although Zweig fled to Brazil, he still committed suicide in despair. Camus belongs to a new generation of young people. He once joined the French Communist Party, fought and resisted, and condensed the power of his resistance into continuous writing. If the deaths of Benjamin and Zweig marked the spiritual boundaries of yesterday&#39;s world, Camus established the starting point of his writing on the wasteland of war and post-war. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The postwar world is neither a wasteland nor a new heaven and a new earth. His arguments with his friend Sartre and his ambivalent attitude toward the Algerian War made Camus increasingly lonely while receiving literary honors. When he returned to autobiographical writing and the &quot;first person&quot;, an accident caused this sharp soul to bid farewell in advance. For a writer like Camus, commemorating him at any time is both our condolences and an invitation for him to return. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;France’s “outsider”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;At 2 a.m. on November 7, 1913, her mother Catalina gave birth to Camus, who was the first child in the family. second son. The next day, at the Mondovi Municipal Government in Algeria, the father registered the birth of his child. He was 28 years old and worked as a wine cellar manager. The mother was 31 years old and filled in the occupation column as a housewife. The birthplace of Saint-Paul Farm is located 8 kilometers south of the city of Mondovi. The nearby city of Bonny is the most important port in French Algeria, not far from the Tunisian border. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After Algeria became a French colony in the 19th century, most of the immigrants who immigrated here were poor people from all over France, as well as Spain, Italy and other European countries. New immigrants were granted residence rights under French protection and lived among the overwhelming majority of locals. “The French in Algeria are of mixed race. Spaniards, Alsatians, Italians, Maltese, Jews, Greeks gather there,” Camus later wrote. Camus is a mixed-race child, his mother is Spanish, and he believes that his father comes from Alsace, the battlefield where France and Germany have fought for generations. The reason for &quot;thinking&quot; is that my father&#39;s exact ancestral home has been lost and difficult to find. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Camus had never met his father before he could remember. My father is 1.8 meters tall, with brown hair and blue eyes. He works in a wine company, supervising the grape pressing, winemaking, storage, and shipment to the Port of Pawnee for shipment. Not long after Camus was born, World War I broke out, and his father was conscripted into the French army. Almost as soon as he entered the battlefield, he was injured in the Battle of the Marne to prevent the German army from advancing towards Paris. He was hit by shell fragments and was sent to a rear hospital. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 11, 1914, my mother received the bad news by telegram, as well as a small piece of shrapnel removed from her husband&#39;s head that the widow had asked to keep. His father was mysterious to Camus. He often asked his mother: &quot;Am I really like my father?&quot; &quot;Oh, you look exactly like your father.&quot; During the four years of World War I, his mother received no After passing a penny in France, it was only a few months before the end of the war that I received official notification of her husband&#39;s death and a pension check. An accountant next door helped her fill out the pension application form because no one in her family knew how to fill it out. In order to make a living, my mother sorted warheads in an ammunition manufacturing factory until she suffered from rheumatism and was unable to continue this work, so she began to work as a domestic helper. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From 8 months to 17 years old, Camus lived with his mother and grandmother under the same roof in Algiers, the capital of Algeria. It was Belku, the workers&#39; district of the city, home to people who worked hard in small workshops and port equipment factories, craftsmen, small traders, grassroots civil servants and clerks. As an adult, Camus returned to the house frequently, sometimes to visit the elderly and sometimes as a temporary haven. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When he was in middle school, football fascinated Camus. He was very brave and liked to tackle from the feet of his opponents, so he was often injured. Camus described a fierce football match, on a pitch adjacent to a cemetery, in which the opposing players pressed forward mercilessly. They “were all on top of me, spikes on my shins, knees on my crotch, squeezing me against the goal post…” “I quickly learned that the ball doesn’t come from where you expect it to. This was very helpful in my life, especially in France, where not everyone is honest,&quot; Camus later wrote. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When Camus came to settle in Paris in early 1940, he felt that &quot;I am not from here, nor from anywhere else. The world is just a strange scenery, and my spirit is helpless here. Everything It has nothing to do with yourself.&quot; He was stuck between France and Algeria, between Paris and impoverished Bercoux across the Mediterranean. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/07/D85zsS7RbQjcftzjyXxFffCFWWU1bBZahgssH1sC.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;969&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/07/D85zsS7RbQjcftzjyXxFffCFWWU1bBZahgssH1sC.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;257305&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Camus (first from right) is backstage with two actors during the performance of his drama &quot;Martial Law&quot; in Paris in 1948. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;Sisyphus&quot;: The victorious loser&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt; p>;While Sartre, who came from a middle-class background, was dreaming of a literary hero, and Beauvoir was enjoying her books and the gifts in the candy shop window, Camus was in a home without electricity, running water, newspapers and books, and no Growing up in the world of radio, he once wrote in his diary: &quot;Living in poverty for a few years is enough to create all the sensitivity.&quot; Tuberculosis plagued Camus throughout his life, but it also exempted him from military service. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1942, &quot;The Outsider&quot; and &quot;The Myth of Sisyphus&quot; were published one after another. The former tells the story of a French-Algerian named Meursault who experienced two deaths. The first was his mother&#39;s death. He couldn&#39;t even remember the date and didn&#39;t shed tears. The second was when he had an affair with a holdover on the beach. There was a conflict with the Arab about the knife. Meursault happened to be holding a friend&#39;s gun. When his eyes were dazzled by the reflection of the sea and the blade, he almost subconsciously shot the man. After being arrested, Meursault told the judge in confusion that the reason he shot was the sun. Meursault did not defend himself, and the court also lacked interest in the murder case and focused on investigating his personal life. Indifference became the biggest evidence of crime and was sentenced to death. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The title of the essay collection &quot;The Myth of Sisyphus&quot; is taken from a story in &quot;Homer&#39;s Epic&quot;. King Sisyphus disobeyed God and was sentenced to push a huge boulder up a mountain for eternity, each time the boulder approached the top of the mountain. When the time comes, it will slip from his hand and roll down again, and he can only go back again, starting over and over again. Camus used the myth of Sisyphus, just like Freud through the Oedipus complex, to make the mythical figure deeply rooted in people&#39;s hearts again. The most famous sentence in &quot;The Myth of Sisyphus&quot; may be: &quot;There is only one philosophical question that is truly serious, and that is suicide. To judge whether life is worth living or not...&quot; Camus said in the preface of an English translation many years later , wrote this book because &quot;even within the borders of nihilism, it is possible to find ways to move beyond nihilism.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The play Caligula, published in 1944, discusses freedom and meaninglessness pushed to the extreme by recreating the story of the assassinated Roman Emperor Suetonius. These three books are collectively called Camus&#39; &quot;Trilogy of the Absurd.&quot; They were written and published in the critical state of war and occupied Paris, where everything was compromised and everything was lost. From Kierkegaard&#39;s existential philosophy, Camus saw Abraham, who sacrificed his son, as &quot;infinitely He gave up everything, and then took it all back with the help of absurd power.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Camus took the initiative to get to know him during the rehearsal of Sartre&#39;s play &quot;The Fly&quot;, and the two hit it off. Previously, Sartre had written an article for Camus&#39;s novel &quot;The Stranger&quot;, and Camus had commented on it. The special &quot;Disgusting&quot;. Beauvoir and Sartre found that Camus was a simple, happy man who was always funny and vulgar in his conversations, very emotional, and would even sit on a snowy street at two in the morning and talk about his love troubles. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Don Juan went from one woman to another not because of a lack of love, but because he loved them with equal passion and devoted himself to them every time. He must repeat this talent and harmony. Explore... Why do you have to love less to love well?&quot; &quot;The Myth of Sisyphus&quot; reads. Camus had two marriages. His first wife, Simone, was unable to quit morphine, which caused him great psychological trauma. After remarrying Francine, Camus maintained semi-public intimate relationships with many women. , including theater actress Maria Casares, who exchanged more than 800 love letters. It is as if Don Juan became an incarnation of Sisyphus pushing the boulder. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;The Plague&quot;: End and Resistance&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;After the end of World War II and the liberation of Paris, the reputations of Sartre, Beauvoir and Camus were at their peak, and the Left Bank The Flower Goddess and the Double Sole Cafe in Shanghai have shrouded the halo of existentialist writers, and the radius of the halo extends to the United States on the other side of the ocean. All three of them received invitations to visit from New York. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From March to May 1946, Camus traveled around the United States. He was more nervous than Sartre and felt that he was always affected by endless little troubles. He&#39;s also a careful observer, noting that Americans drink juice in the morning, drink scotch and soda across the country, and are passionate about animals, from gorillas at the Bronx Zoo to taxidermy at the Museum of Natural History. , death and the dead can be dressed up as quickly as possible, &quot;die and leave the rest to us.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The only place that made Camus feel familiar and at ease was the Bowery Street in New York. At that time, it was still an abandoned area, full of cheap bars and run-down hotels, with the elevated railway running from the height of the second floor. Passing by, shadows covered everything below. Camus was disgusted by the United States and felt that there was a lack of pain and tragedy, but in the eyes of many critics, &quot;The Stranger&quot; is a parody of American noir novels. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1947, the novel &quot;The Plague&quot; was published and was so popular among readers that it was reprinted eight times in two years. After that, &quot;The Plague&quot; and &quot;The Stranger&quot; were at the top of the French literary bestseller list for a long time. From 1941 to 1942, the plague was prevalent in Algeria, which was the starting point for Camus to prepare &quot;The Plague&quot;. The reason why this novel is so thrilling is because the plague is described as both real and terrifying, and it is also symbolic. It alludes to World War II. During this period, the harsh reality of the Nazis in Germany was wreaking havoc. Nazism and fascism are also a political and spiritual plague. Its military power, spy system, autocracy and racism sweep across everything like the god of death. After being manipulated by it, they either succumb to it, cooperate with it, or know that it is impossible. Those who resist for the land are like all living beings in the plague. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Camus highlighted three symbolic situations of life. One is the situation of separation, including the separation of relatives, separation of husband and wife, and separation of lovers, which means isolation, blockade, imprisonment, and exile. , concentration camp... The second is that there is no condition of any woman in the novel, which means imbalance, deformity, bitterness, and lifelessness... The most terrifying atmosphere and situation is death...&quot; Liu Mingjiu, the translator of the Chinese version of &quot;The Plague&quot; Said, &quot;&#39;The plague is lurking in everyone, because no one, yes, no one in the world is immune to it&#39;... In this way, Camus also put his philosophy about the absurd world in &quot;The Plague&quot; It greatly broadens and deepens the story, and points the absurd roots to human faults and human society.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During the desperate situation of World War II, Camus was not the only one who chose to write about a critical state through the background of the plague. , the German playwright Brecht also created &quot;The Life of Galileo&quot;, in which Galileo also experienced a narrow escape from the plague. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“I tried to use the plague to express the suffocation we suffer and the environment we endure that threatens and drives people into exile.” Camus said. In the apocalyptic city of Ahlan, the protagonist of the novel, Dr. Bernard Rieux, became an ordinary hero because of his dedication to his duties. Camus reshapes heroes in the form of anti-heroes. When disaster strikes, what we can expect is not a hero falling from the sky, but every ordinary person resisting evil through the smallest efforts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Resistor, a collection of essays published in 1951, is where Camus clearly proposed the philosophy of resistance after the philosophy of the absurd, &quot;What is a rebel? A person who says &#39;no&#39;. However, although he He refuses but does not give up: he is also the person who says &#39;yes&#39; from the very beginning.&quot; However, this book with a huge amount of information put him in a situation where he was surrounded by others. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Back to &quot;First Man&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&quot;Rebel&quot; involves a commentary on Surrealism and was immediately criticized literary by the group. Refute. More intense criticism came from leftist thinkers. Because he disagreed with Camus&#39;s many views on the revolution and Soviet history, the magazine &quot;Modern&quot; edited by Sartre published a fiercely criticized article by its editor, Francis Chanson. Camus had to respond and wrote an open letter to Sartre to defend himself. This led to Sartre&#39;s &quot;Reply to Camus&quot;, which was extremely harsh and mean, calling Camus &quot;a bourgeois&quot; and &quot;abandoned history&quot;, and the publication of &quot;The Resistance&quot; was a counter-revolutionary &quot;Thermidor Coup&quot;. . Their long-standing friendship was ruined. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Unlike many writers who only define their writing by &quot;pure literature&quot;, Camus has always been an organic intellectual. It was the strong &quot;political nature&quot; of &quot;The Resistance&quot; that stirred up the hornet&#39;s nest. The break between Sartre and Camus, the pair of existential writers, and the subsequent breakup between Godard and Truffaut, the twin stars of the French New Wave of cinema, became sensational and intriguing events in the postwar cultural history. Sartre stood in a more radical position. Even when it came to the Nobel Prize, he was more radical and rejected it outright. What is depressing is that Camus, a writer who has always been in the progressive camp, was denounced as conservative because he was more moderate on certain issues, or did not follow a certain principle or dogma and put forward his personal understanding and judgment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1949, Camus created a play &quot;The Just&quot;, in which a group of &quot;terrorists&quot; debate whether innocent people can be harmed when carrying out political assassinations. Camus made it clear that this was wrong. When Algeria&#39;s independence struggle broke out in 1954, he also believed that the rebels&#39; planting bombs and killing innocent people were equally unfair as the French government&#39;s violence and execution. This view made him controversial. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;1957年，在庆祝加缪获得诺贝尔文学奖的讲话中，有人要求加缪解释他不支持反抗殖民主义的阿尔及利亚起义军的原因，他说：“现在人们正往阿尔及利亚的电车轨道上放炸弹。我母亲可能就在其中一条车轨上。如果这就是正义的话，那么我宁愿选择我的母亲。”加缪呼吁在阿尔及利亚建立一个阿拉伯人、柏柏尔人、黑脚法国人（欧洲移民）平等执政的联合政府，这让所有人都讨厌他。 French nationalists feel that he sympathizes with Algerians, and Algerians feel that he represents white French people. However, his father died needlessly at the age of 29, and his mother was an extremely poor and illiterate woman. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On January 4, 1960, the car driven by publisher Michel Gallimard with Albert Camus in the back seat crashed into a tree, rolled and struck another. In the tree, Camus was thrown out of the back window. In the mud not far away, people found a briefcase containing Camus&#39;s diary and an unfinished novel &quot;First Man&quot;. This book is based on his childhood life in Algeria and imagines him. &#39;s father. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After Camus passed away, although Sartre did not forgive him, he wrote an obituary full of praise in the &quot;Osservatore Française&quot;: &quot;He was the heir to the ethical school of anti-historical trends in the 20th century. , his works are perhaps the most original of all French literati. His stubborn, narrow-minded, simple and simple humanitarian feelings launched an unreasonable challenge to the widespread and ugly orders of our time.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After receiving the news of Camus’ death over the phone, Beauvoir took sleeping pills that had been discontinued for a long time, but still couldn’t fall asleep, so she got out of bed and braved the biting January drizzle in Paris. Wandering the streets. The next morning, she was still in a daze: &quot;He can&#39;t see this morning.&quot; But in fact, Camus not only did not pass away, but because of the strong impact of the car accident, he became the center of the world&#39;s attention. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在《加缪笔记》的最后几页里，有这样几句话：“在给予你的短暂的白天，取暖吧，照亮吧，不要偏离了你的跑道。……其他几百万个太阳前来陪伴你休息。……在快乐的石板下，第一次入眠。……由风来播种，由风来收获，但创造者是人，穿越时代，以刹那的生命为傲。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999;&quot;>;（参考资料：赫伯特·洛特曼《加缪传》，莎拉·贝克韦尔《存在主义咖啡馆》，柳鸣九编《加缪全集》，郭宏安译《加缪笔记：1935—1959（精选集）》）&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;获取更多RSS：&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 07 Nov 2023 23:25:05 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[再访“山地之王”：高仙芝的西域足迹]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260116]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-07 22:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Hijri 133 (&lt;em>;Ten years of Tianbao in the Tang Dynasty, AD&lt;/em>;&lt;em>;751 &lt;/em>;), the month of pilgrimage. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Hajj month is the 12th month of Muharram. This year&#39;s pilgrimage month is in midsummer. On the edge of the Central Asian steppes, a black flag army knelt down and prayed in the direction of the Holy Land on the right bank of the Talas River, completed the morning ritual, and then set up its formation facing the rising sun. : At the front are light cavalry equipped with large horses. They hold Damascus scimitars and stand on foot to harness their power; then there is an infantry group mainly composed of Khorasan and Tocharian people, and behind them are archers and long-range soldiers. Spearmen; on both wings are Sogdian cavalry from the river countries. Although they are high-spirited, they have not been naturalized for a long time, and they are pagans. Their combat effectiveness is still questionable, so they are used to protect the flanks of the Islamic army. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Opposite the black flag army are the enemy forces from the mysterious silk country in the east. They were much smaller in number, so they placed their infantry in front in a defensive formation. These infantrymen are uniformly holding Eastern-style long-handled swords, which are bladed on both sides, reflecting dazzling light in the morning sun. The huge stainless steel blade is extremely sharp, no less than the cannibal&#39;s scimitar. With its weight Able to split a galloping horse in half, and as strong as a spearman to withstand the impact of cavalry. These infantrymen are also equipped with horses for marching, but these pack horses are now scattered along the Talas River behind the enemy&#39;s side. Behind the infantry were crossbowmen equipped with powerful crossbows, and on both sides were Qarluks Turkic cavalry from the northern steppes. Behind the main force of these infantry and cavalry are their commanders, divided into main generals, deputy generals and special generals, as well as vassal troops from Bakhna as reserves - I heard that those guys started this war. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The commander-in-chief of the Black Flag Army, Abu Muslim, is The great food in black &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(currently translated as the Abbasid Dynasty)&lt;/span>; is the leading founding father and a military genius who became a monk on the way. He was born as a slave of Persian descent and had been preaching at the bottom of the Great Food Empire for a long time. He returned to his homeland of Persia six years ago and raised an army to resist the white-clothed Food Empire&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 毷体, 毷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(now Translated by Umayyad Dynasty)&lt;/span>;. Last winter, he led his army into Mesopotamia. In the Battle of the Zab River, he won with a small number and a large number. He first used an array of spearmen to withstand multiple rounds of attacks by the opponent&#39;s cavalry, and then launched a cavalry charge to defeat the enemy who had lost their fighting spirit. The infantry forced into the river with floating ice floes, defeated the enemy that was at least three times their size, hammered the last nail in the coffin of the white-clothed food that had enjoyed the country for ninety years, and established a more than 500-year-old army in Baghdad. Years of black food. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This year he once again set out from Persia on an expedition to Central Asia to face the Chinese army who also came from afar. The commander of the other side heard that he was a handsome man named Gao Xianzhi. However, the origin of this battle has to start in Persia a full hundred years ago. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/07/g89DKg3BB0Dayb1jFBC6r4iCeGOueEJD3SKB5SKo.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/07/g89DKg3BB0Dayb1jFBC6r4iCeGOueEJD3SKB5SKo.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;257248&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The Talas Valley in Kyrgyzstan.

The envoy said that a group of barbarians from the west were attacking Persia: they asked us to choose one of three situations: either accept their faith, pay a poll tax, or go to war. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The envoy did not know that when he begged Tang Gaozong to send troops to rescue Persia, Yi Siqi had already died on the way to escape. The surviving prince Belus &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>; (Persian means &quot;Victor&quot;)&lt;/span>; suffered repeated defeats and finally fled to China. , and died here, buried in Luoyang, the eastern capital. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;barbarians&quot; who destroyed the Sasanian Dynasty were called &quot;Tachik&quot; by the Persians, but they were actually Arabs. The name &quot;Dashi&quot; comes from the Tayyi tribe in eastern Arabia. It was regarded by the Persians as a collective name for Arab Muslims. After it was spread to the Tang Dynasty, because they used white flags, Chinese history books called it &quot;Dashi in White&quot;. . After the Persians converted to Islam, they were called Tachik by the Turks. This is probably the origin of the name of the Tajik people who also speak Persian today. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Zhi, who had been on the throne for less than three years, had no interest in rescuing Persia, which was far away. At that time, the Tang Dynasty had not yet completely pacified southern Xinjiang, and its limited military resources had to be used to control the four towns of Anxi to the east of Congling, and were beyond its reach to the west of Congling. After Dashi conquered Persia, the expansion momentum in the east was suspended due to domestic battles for throne. It was not until the 60th year that the rear sent the famous general Qutaybah ibn Muslim to the east to attack the Transoxiana region. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Hezhong&quot; area, as the name suggests, is the Amu Darya River, the two largest rivers in Central Asia&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>; (called Wuhu River in ancient times)&lt; /span>;The plain area between the Syr Darya River (ancient name Yaoshashui), it borders the Central Asian grasslands to the north, the Tianshan Mountains and the Hindu Kush Mountains to the southeast, two long and high majestic mountain ranges, and Persia to the southwest plateau. Business travelers who walked out of Congling along the two rivers gathered here, and the goods changed hands here and continued to the Mesopotamia and Asia Minor through the Persian Plateau. Therefore, the Transoxiang area has been an important hub of the Silk Road since ancient times. During the Han Dynasty, the Yuezhi people migrated here from the Mongolian Plateau under the attacks of the Xiongnu and Wusun. After merging with the locals, they formed the Sogdians. They established many oasis countries such as Kang, Shi, An, and Shi in the arid river area. Chinese history books call them the Nine Surnames of Zhaowu. Because the Sogdians lived on the trade route, they became an outstanding commercial nation that integrated trade between the East and the West in the Middle Ages. A large number of merchants moved to the Central Plains to work as businessmen. The image of the Hu people on the camels and horses in the Tang Sancai is the Sogdians. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/07/zWVM9sgAhdxB6FB4f9sVoP03czN5Ac0gFEb5Mdgw.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;641&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/07/zWVM9sgAhdxB6FB4f9sVoP03czN5Ac0gFEb5Mdgw.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;257243&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color ; >;In the first year of Xiantian of the Tang Dynasty&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(712 AD)&lt;/span>;, Qu Dibo marched into the river from Khorasan in northeastern Persia, and successively Capture Samadan&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>; (now translated as Samarkand)&lt;/span>;, and the Kingdom of Shi , STKaiti;&quot;>;(today&#39;s Tashkent)&lt;/span>;, Bakhna&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(today&#39;s translation of Fergana)&lt;/span>; and other countries. At that time, Li Longji, Emperor Xuanzong of the Tang Dynasty, had just ascended the throne and was plotting to overthrow his aunt Princess Taiping, who was involved in politics. They were as indifferent to the killings west of Congling as his grandfather Li Zhi was. Two years later, Qu Dibo, who was militarily unstoppable, was accidentally killed during civil strife. The white-clad army retreated as quickly as it came. Tubo, which had coveted this place for a long time, took advantage of the opportunity and established the new king Ada in Bukhanna. This move immediately aroused great vigilance in the Tang Dynasty. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Why is this? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/07/Gu8dOFRAYyug80Y3jExmNtI4WyKn7reqLtfQmyJc.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/07/Gu8dOFRAYyug80Y3jExmNtI4WyKn7reqLtfQmyJc.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;257246&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Samarkand, Uzbekistan&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;中Sub-geopolitics&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&quot;Bahanna&quot; is an ancient name, now it is called &quot;Ferg&#39;ona&quot;, and its consonant &quot;g&quot; was still given by Russian colonists In addition, I heard that the local people actually pronounce it as Fer&#39;ana, and the pronunciation is close to &quot;Fuana&quot;.

Especially in the small Fergana Basin, they actually divided them It was divided among the three union republics of Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, and a large number of enclaves and even enclaves within enclaves were carved out. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/07/33ezPesUQEIzRou4lHGBFQj0Muo9RpprdfQPffuO.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;717&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/07/33ezPesUQEIzRou4lHGBFQj0Muo9RpprdfQPffuO.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;257244&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Fergana Basin map, enclaves within enclaves, can be seen intertwined. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Wang Zaitian/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Bakhanna in the Tang Dynasty did not have these disputes. It was a single-ethnic Sogdian country. It was located in Between Suiye, an important town in the Western Regions of the Tang Dynasty, and the Hezhong countries, it was the key point from the Anxi Protectorate to the Hezhong area via Congling. What&#39;s more important is that the Tang Dynasty could accept the food control of Bukhana, but it could not sit back and watch Tibet enter the Central Asian grasslands - this involved the geopolitics among the four major countries in Central Asia at that time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Bakhanna is surrounded by great powers, with Turks in the north, Tubo in the south, Dashi in the west, and Tang in the east. The Turks were traditional conquerors of the grasslands, and used their strong fighting power to collect protection fees from the riverine countries; the White Food was an emerging empire that combined politics and religion, but in the early stages of its expansion, it was neither for war nor for wealth, but for &quot;Find an outlet for the warlike spirit of each tribe&quot; - Turks and Dashi are a zero-sum game between the old and new conquerors, which cannot be reconciled; Tubo arose in the bitter cold land of Qinghai-Tibet, and always aimed at the rich Central Plains, but suffered from Unable to open the tightly-knitted fences of the Tang Dynasty, they detoured to Congling, hoping to join forces with the Turks in the north to carve up the western regions of the Tang Dynasty, and then enter the hinterland of the Central Plains along the Hexi Corridor; and the Tang Dynasty was the only one of the four great powers to be dominated by farming. The political power established by the nation, the primary goal of opening up the Western Region is to use offense as defense to defend its own territory: from Guanzhong via Longxi and Hexi to Anxi, and finally reach Congling, the western border of the Tarim Basin. Just defend the towering Congling. Block external forces from entering the Central Plains. Therefore, the Tang Dynasty’s pursuit was not to plunder land and colonize&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(大食)&lt;/span>; or to exploit the natives&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(Turkic)&lt;/span>;, opening up channels&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(Tubo)&lt;/span>; or protecting trade routes ——The trade routes were just a by-product of the expansion of the Tang Dynasty, not the purpose. Instead, they simply defended themselves and blocked the north-south passages to prevent powerful enemies from forming alliances to deal with them. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this way, Tubo and Turks from the south and north seek to join forces to attack the common enemy Tang Dynasty, while Datang Dynasty and Dashi Dynasty occupy both sides of Congling, one from the east and the other from the west. Once Tibet crossed this east-west equilibrium line and was expected to enter the northern grasslands and join the Turks, Datang&#39;s &quot;red alert&quot; was triggered. In the third year of Kaiyuan of the Tang Dynasty (715 AD), Qu Dibo was killed, the food army withdrew, and the Tubo army In the year when they conquered Ba Khanna, Zhang Xiaosong, the supervisory censor who was inspecting the Anxi Protectorate, made a decisive decision. He marched across the Daidai territory and commanded the vassal army of the slave country to march thousands of miles straight, crossed the Congling Mountains and arrived at the Ba Khanna Basin, where he defeated the heavy Tibetan army. Eight hundred years after Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty conquered Dawan, he occupied this place again and blocked the Tibetan entrance to the Central Asian grassland through the Congling West Road. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After that, Tubo tried to open up the Congling East Road through Taobolu, but was also frustrated by Zhang Xiaosong, who was the governor of Beiting at the time: in the tenth year of Kaiyuan&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti ;&quot;>;(722 AD)&lt;/span>; Zhang Xiaosong sent 4,000 cavalry to rescue Xiao Bolu and defeated the Tibetan army. This matter has been mentioned in the previous article &quot;Visiting the &quot;King of the Mountains&quot;: Gao Xianzhi&#39;s Plateau Footprints&quot; and, so I won’t go into details. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Expedition to Congling West Road&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Eight Years of Tianbao in the Tang Dynasty&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>; (749 AD)&lt;/span>;, two years after Gao Xianzhi regained Xiaobolu, he returned to Boxian &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>; (today&#39;s Qiemo, Xinjiang)&lt;/span>; span>;Destroy Tubo. The Tibetan army, which suffered a bloody blow on the eastern front, had to turn around and head to the Congling West Road on the western front to find the weaknesses of the Tang Dynasty&#39;s Western Region defense system. After receiving the information, Gao Xianzhi could have gone to Bahanna, where he would have been waiting for the Tibetan troops who had been on an expedition to come and give them a head-on attack. However, Gao Xianzhi, who had been pursuing the initiative on the battlefield all his life, did not do that: since the Congling West Road was still passable. , then I will cut it off completely! &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/07/3rArVE0YBeev16pAJzunHE89Ik8YSr6hsWP04pSA.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/07/3rArVE0YBeev16pAJzunHE89Ik8YSr6hsWP04pSA.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;257245&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Street scene in Chitral, Pakistan, the seat of the ancient Shishi Kingdom. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Wang Zaitian/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tianbao Nine Years&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>; (A.D. 750)&lt;/span>; Gao Xianzhi sent troops to Congling for the second time and came to Xiaobolu again. From there, he followed the Suyi River (Today&#39;s Gilgit River)&lt;/span>;Go upstream, cross the Shanduer Pass, and head to the Kingdom of Shishi at the eastern foot of the central Hindu Kush Mountains ;&quot;>;(now Chitral, Pakistan)&lt;/span>;. Some historians have verified that the Kingdom of Shishi was the end point of Alexander the Great&#39;s Eastern Expedition. The ancient tribes that thrive in the nearby Kalasha Valley are said to be the descendants of the Greek expeditionary force. The distance from Xiaobolu to Yushi is more than 700 miles. Now it takes two full days to travel by road. The road conditions are very good on the first day, and there are long-distance buses available. On the second day, we can only take the local four-wheel drive with the villagers. It is possible to travel west along the Mastuj Valley, with the continuous snow-capped mountains of the Hindu Kush to the north and the 6,542-meter-high snow-capped mountains of the Hindu Raj to the south. Peak Buni Zom. The Mastuje River cuts deeply into the dense loess at your feet, forming a T-shaped towering platform, which is reminiscent of the Tuolai River Valley outside Jiayuguan. The soldiers under Gao Xianzhi must have drank by the Tuolai River on their way from the Central Plains to the Western Regions via Hexi. Let&#39;s cross the horse, I believe they also discovered the similarities between the two places. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/07/XKBIVpjK1iLdWvZmVtjxBKcinAQzrDdombTDnHD8.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/07/XKBIVpjK1iLdWvZmVtjxBKcinAQzrDdombTDnHD8.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;257247&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Toolai Valley outside Jiayuguan&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Wang Zaitian/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Two Tang Books&quot; &quot;&quot; does not record how long Gao Xianzhi went on the expedition against the Xu division, and &quot;Zizhi Tongjian&quot; only mentions the winter march of the Tang army. According to my estimate of the terrain along the route of our division, it would have taken an ancient army at least half a month to carry its baggage. It was even more difficult for the Tubo army: since the Tang army had controlled Xiaobolu and the Suyi River Valley three years ago, the Tubo army had to detour through the high mountains in the south. Whether they could reach Yushi in a month was a problem. The Kingdom of Yushi is an ally of Tubo. It is located at the midpoint of the West Congling Road. After passing Yushi, you can cross the Hindu Kush Mountains, then follow the Panchi River through the Alai Mountains in the west of Congling and the West Tianshan Mountains, and finally arrive at Bakhna Basin - that was another more than a month&#39;s journey. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Because Gao Xianzhi made a surprise attack on the Chu army and cut off the west road of Congling, the extremely tired Tibetan soldiers who had come from afar no longer had to cross the four great mountains of Hindu Lage, Hindu Kush, Congling and Xitian Mountain. Mountains, not to mention struggling to attack the fortress jointly guarded by the Tang army and the Sogdians in the scorching Bukhan, you can return to the cool Qinghai-Tibet Plateau all in one piece - isn&#39;t this the peace dividend brought by General Gao of the Tang Dynasty? ? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Therefore, after losing the important relay point of Xushi Division, Tubo completely gave up the idea of ​​opening up the east and west roads of Congling. Zai and Thirteen were defeated by Gao Xianzhi&#39;s successor Feng Changqing on the two eastern fronts, so that the Tibetan army was unable to pose a major threat to the Western Regions of the Tang Dynasty for the next ten years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Gao Xianzhi successively put down the Tibetan offensive on the east and west fronts, and pushed the Tang Dynasty&#39;s military control line from the east of Congling to the west of Congling, achieving the strategic goal of stabilizing the Western Region and defending the Central Plains. It can be said that it has achieved reached the pinnacle of personal military achievement. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, at this moment, he received a letter of request for help from Ba Khanna, asking him to stop by the army to attack the Shi Kingdom. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/07/4NUFlw1iZ78PBTmVSciXzpzLt78lKcF5iugBYzAd.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/07/4NUFlw1iZ78PBTmVSciXzpzLt78lKcF5iugBYzAd.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;257249&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Traditional teahouse in the Fergana Basin&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt; strong>;&quot;All the Hus are angry&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Bakhanna was first destroyed by the White-coated Eaters, and then was supported by Tubo as a puppet regime. Finally, the country was restored with the aid of the Tang Dynasty&#39;s reinforcements, so it was China&#39;s The most loyal vassal state in Asia to the Tang Dynasty can be compared to Goryeo to the Ming Dynasty. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So why did Bahan call on the Tang army to attack Shiguo? There is a lack of clear historical records on this matter. It is generally believed that there may be three reasons. First, there is a gap between Bukhanna and Shiguo. Bukhanna is located in the basin upstream of Yaoxishui, while Shiguo is located downstream of the basin where Yaoxashui flows out. , its capital city, Toshkent, is today&#39;s capital of Uzbekistan, Tashkent. &quot;Toshkent&quot; means &quot;Tosh&quot;, which means &quot;stone&quot; in Turkic language. The two countries are both Sogdian countries. The Shi State blocked the exit of Bukhanna to the Central Asian grasslands, while the Bukhanna blocked the water source of the Shiguo. There may be grudges between the two countries; secondly, Bukhanna showed his loyalty to the Tang Dynasty. Take advantage of the power vacuum in the Hezhong area to control it; thirdly, the Shi Kingdom is located at the frontier of the Hezhong area and the Central Asian grasslands, and has good relations with Tuqishi, the successor of the main Turkic tribe Tuqishi, surnamed Huang, and Tuqishi It has long been a threat to Datang and has stepped on Datang&#39;s red line. In short, Gao Xianzhi adopted Ba Khanna&#39;s suggestion, led the army northward into the Fergana Basin, and then followed Yaoshashui to the Stone Kingdom. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Shi Kingdom belongs to the nine surnamed states of Zhaowu in the Hezhong area. It is the land controlled by the Tang Dynasty. They regard the Tang Dynasty as their suzerain state and pay regular tribute to the Tang Dynasty, but they have no practical administrative, financial and military capabilities. Manage and control relationships. The name of Gao Xianzhi&#39;s crusade against Shiguo was &quot;no vassal courtesy&quot;, but the specific crimes were not listed in the history books. The weak Shi Kingdom proposed peace, but Gao Xianzhi pretended to agree, but imprisoned Naju Chebishi, the king of Shi Kingdom who came to negotiate in person - he had used a similar strategy in the Battle of Xiaobolu to trap his relatives with property. After the Tubo nobles came out of the city, they arrested and beheaded them - and then captured Tuozhe City without any bloodshed. After the city was broken, Gao Xianzhi sent his troops to massacre and plunder a large number of treasures from the Shi Kingdom. He himself received &quot;more than ten dendrobiums, five or six golden camels, many good horses and precious jade, and his family was rich in millions.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Sese&quot; mentioned here is one of the most expensive minerals in the Middle Ages: lapis lazuli. It originates from the Badakhshan region in the upper reaches of the Wuhu River &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 毷体, 毷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>; (now northeastern Afghanistan)&lt;/span>;, and is re-exported and trafficked through the river area to All over the world, it is not only a precious gemstone, a &quot;magic medicine&quot; for treating diseases, but also a rare blue and purple pigment. The turquoise tone that became popular in the 2022 New Year&#39;s Eve dance &quot;Only This Green&quot; originated from the handed down treasure &quot;A Thousand Miles of Rivers and Mountains&quot; painted by Song Huizong with precious lapis lazuli from the palace collection for the young painter Wang Ximeng, and Bai Juyi&#39;s famous saying &quot; &quot;Half the river is rustling and half the river is red&quot;, what is chanted is also the color of lapis lazuli that the river emits under the setting sun. Gao Xianzhi plundered a large amount of lapis lazuli from the Stone Kingdom, which must have been treasures accumulated in his treasury over the years, especially before gold, so its value can be imagined. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/07/b1FmncUzLH6tfu6CZ4uaYCNuxrIL4vqFm4MtFpXC.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/07/b1FmncUzLH6tfu6CZ4uaYCNuxrIL4vqFm4MtFpXC.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;257251&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color ; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Gao Xianzhi captured the King of Shiguo, the King of Yushi, the Tubo chief and the Tuqi Shi Khan surnamed Huang who was probably captured in Shiguo during this expedition&lt;span style=&quot;font- family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(This may explain why Gao Xianzhi massacred Tuozhe City to punish Shi Guo&#39;s collaboration with the enemy)&lt;/span>; All of them were sent back to Chang&#39;an to offer prisoners, and their military exploits can be described as outstanding. But he His betrayal of trust and cruel massacre aroused the public indignation of all the countries in the river except Ba Khanna. According to the &quot;Zizhi Tongjian&quot; record, &quot;The prince of Shiguo fled to the barbarians and accused Xianzhi of deception, corruption and violence.&quot; . All the barbarians were angry, and they lured Da Shi to attack the four towns.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the historical records of Da Shi, the cause of the war was that Ba Khanna was hostile to the Shi Kingdom and asked for help from the Tang Dynasty; the Tang army surrounded Shi Kingdom, the king of Shi Kingdom surrendered and was not persecuted; after Dashi learned about this, he sent troops to fight against Tang Dynasty - this narrative lacks logic and it is difficult to explain the reason why Dashi sent troops. In my opinion, Dashi sent troops that year The change of dynasty has just been completed, and the black-clothed food has replaced the white-clothed food. A victory in the external war is needed to heal the internal divisions. The commander-in-chief Bingbo Xilin has just suppressed Anguo&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: italic style, italic style _GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(today&#39;s Bukhara, Uzbekistan)&lt;/span>;&#39;s rebellion freed up his hands to use Anguo as a base to send troops to invade the Hezhong area that his predecessor Qudibo had conquered. Now the Hezhong countries take the initiative He came to submit and fell into his trap. Bo Xilin then took over and annexed all the land in the river, and then led the high-spirited army of Dashi and the vassal armies of the river countries to march eastward along the Central Asian grasslands, with a straight front. Refers to Suiye City, the outpost of the Tang Dynasty in the Western Regions.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When Gao Xianzhi learned of the great changes in the river, he led the main forces of the four towns of Anxi and the vassal armies of Geluolu and Bahanna to cross Congling for the third time. Heading to the river to quell the rebellion, the two armies met at Talos between Tuozhe City and Suiye City. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/07/LV5mMBRraRxnE4FS4opPUvRpUNPCVATVuQfAItbC.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;776&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/07/LV5mMBRraRxnE4FS4opPUvRpUNPCVATVuQfAItbC.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;257250&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On the map of the Battle of Talas, Ningyuan is Bakhna. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Wang Zaitian/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;The Battle of Sekigahara in Central Asia&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p >;&quot;Taluosi&quot; is the name of the city in the eastern part of the Stone Kingdom. It is named after the Talas River, which is an intermountain river in the remnants of the Western Tianshan Mountains. Although the water volume is not large, it has a long history and is more than a thousand miles long. The lower reaches of the Talas River flow northwest along the valley and finally enter the grassland area. Today, the mountains within the valley belong to Kyrgyzstan, and the plains outside the valley belong to Kazakhstan. There is a Kyrgyz town called Talas in the valley, and a large Kazakh city called Taraz on the grassland outside the valley. During the Soviet era, the Kirov Reservoir was built at the pass of the Talas Valley in 1975, which blocked the small amount of river water. The reservoir was only 7 meters deep and was used for agricultural irrigation in the valley. Therefore, the Talas River entered Kazakhstan. After the border of Stan, only a trickle remained, forming a thirsty oasis, and finally stopped in the desert. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/07/i0ssPtEHrp7jmmHlYE2eTUJ3Rw4WprHtGo4Lr5yH.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;670&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/07/i0ssPtEHrp7jmmHlYE2eTUJ3Rw4WprHtGo4Lr5yH.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;257253&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The Kirov Reservoir built in the Soviet era&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Wang Zaitian/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In view of It has been so long that it is now impossible to confirm whether Talos City in the Tang Dynasty is today&#39;s Talas Town or Talaz City, or somewhere in between. Because we are located on the border between Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan, as a foreigner, I cannot go to the exit of the Talas Valley—the place where the Talas War is most likely to take place—to conduct inspections, nor can I fly a drone from the air. Overlooking this river valley. But what is certain is that the Datang Allied Forces with fewer troops occupied the inner side of the valley with a slightly higher terrain, using mountains and rivers to protect their flanks; the Dashi Allied Forces with superior strength attacked the valley from the grassland side. The battlefield was opened on the north bank of the Rath River. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/07/Qi7QuQ9GqU7p6cS2EiCHAaHQDek2DTTyYt4N2OjX.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/07/Qi7QuQ9GqU7p6cS2EiCHAaHQDek2DTTyYt4N2OjX.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;257252&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Taras River&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;About the comparison of the military strength of the two sides , historians have different opinions. Currently, it is generally believed that the strength of the Allied Forces of the Tang Dynasty is 20,000 to 30,000. Considering that the strength of the entire Anxi Protectorate does not exceed 30,000, and they have to guard the huge southern border, it is impossible to transfer all of them to the front line. I am inclined to According to the records of &quot;Zi Zhi Tong Jian&quot;, Gao Xianzhi&#39;s total troops for this expedition were about 30,000. It is estimated that half of them were Tang troops, mainly infantry, and the rest were vassal armies of Geluolu and Bahanna. Among them, Geluolu army As cavalry, Bakhna&#39;s army was also dominated by infantry. There is another theory that the Tang army had as many as 60,000 to 70,000 troops, which means that most of them were vassal troops. This is not consistent with the actual situation in the Tang Dynasty when all the people in the Hezhong area rebelled against their relatives and only Bukhanna followed, while Geluo As a newly emerging Turkic tribe, Lu could not provide so many troops. There is even less historical data on the Great Eclipse. It is generally believed that there were 70,000 to 100,000 people, and some believe that it was as high as 200,000 to 300,000 people. I think that the logistics support conditions at that time could not support such a huge force on the grassland expedition, so I tentatively think that this The first battle was a field battle between 70,000 Dashi Allied Forces and 30,000 Datang Allied Forces on the banks of the Talas River. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;History records that this battle lasted for five days. In the first four days, the Dashi army attacked, but failed to break through the tight defensive formation formed by the Tang army. But on the fifth day, the battlefield situation changed dramatically. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some Japanese scholars likened this battle to the &quot;Battle of Sekigahara in Central Asia&quot; - the Battle of Sekigahara was the largest battle in Japan&#39;s Azuchi Momoyama era. The main force of the Western Army was outnumbered. When the enemy was about to take the initiative on the battlefield, the friendly Kobayakawa Hideaki tribe who had been stationary at the top of the flank suddenly switched sides and cut into the rear of the main force of the Western Army, which was fighting fiercely with the Eastern Army, forming a pincer attack on it. The Western Army collapsed. Although this analogy is not exact, it is quite similar to the reversal of the Battle of Talos: The Tang Army&#39;s elite Mo Dao team blocked multiple rounds of attacks from the Food Army. It was expected to replicate the opponent&#39;s coach and Bo Xilin&#39;s victory last year. A successful example in the Battle of Zab River, using cavalry countercharge to crush the enemy&#39;s fighting spirit. It&#39;s a pity that the cavalry troops of the Tang coalition were vassal troops of Geluolu. At this critical moment when the Tang army was about to take the initiative on the battlefield, the Geluolu people, who had a tacit understanding with Dashi, counterattacked and instead cut into the fierce battle with Dashi&#39;s army. The Tang Army&#39;s rear area formed a pincer attack on it, and the main force of the Tang Army fell into a tight encirclement and bitter fighting, suffering all casualties. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The commander-in-chief Gao Xianzhi was unwilling to fail. He also hoped to use the reserve force to stabilize the position, collect the defeated troops on the front line, and then fight the enemy for a showdown. His lieutenant, Li Siye, a fierce general who had made extraordinary achievements in the battle of Lianyunbao, persuaded him to retreat at the critical moment: The general went deep alone without reinforcements, and the surrounding Hu people and other countries were just followers of the victor, and they would definitely be against us. A group formed a siege. Once our entire army is wiped out, who will go back to defend southern Xinjiang? Although I am a reckless man, I can clearly see that the situation is critical, and the general can no longer be rigid and stubborn! &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(&quot;Old Book of Tang Dynasty·Li Siye Biography&quot;: A fool may have a chance to gain, but the situation is so dangerous that he cannot glue the pillar)&lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So, Li Siye dragged Gao Xianzhi to abandon the main force of the surrounded Tang army and retreat eastward along the Talas Valley. The terrain became higher and the mountain roads became narrower. The vassal army of Bukhan, who was the first reserve force to turn around and retreat, blocked the road tightly. The Tang army behind them could not pass through and was about to be overtaken by the Dashi pursuers. At this time, Li Siye put down his sword, picked up his big stick and fired at the friendly troops of Tuhan. &quot;Both men and horses were killed with one hand.&quot; Tuhan&#39;s troops gave way to the left and right, and Gao Xianzhi was able to escape; but the third in command of the Tang army, Biel General Duan Xiushi stepped forward and blamed his superior Li Siye for killing friendly troops in order to escape for his own life. &quot;It is not brave to run in fear of the enemy; it is not benevolent to avoid being trapped by others.&quot; Li Siye stopped the killing in shame. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is the tragic situation of the Tang army after its defeat in Talos. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/07/31CN9JVyp9irZvMms8DXX6lpHkT9teKviZsTsvFl.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/07/31CN9JVyp9irZvMms8DXX6lpHkT9teKviZsTsvFl.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;257254&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Entrance arch in Talas Province, Kyrgyzstan&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>; &lt;strong>;Epilogue&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;After the Battle of Talos, the two armies returned home respectively. Datang and Dashi were still bounded by Congling, and the strategic balance did not fundamentally change.

After the &quot;Anshi Rebellion&quot; broke out, Ba Khanna responded to Tang Suzong&#39;s invitation and sent troops thousands of miles away to assist the Central Plains. To this day, Fergana is still an important silk town in the world, and its raw silk production ranks third in the world.

Many of the shareholders and executives overlapped, but this Three companies have been deregistered. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the Huanan County Government Information Office, Building 7 of the Yuecheng Plaza complex where the accident occurred was built by Heilongjiang Haifeng Weiye Construction and Installation Engineering Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as &quot;Haifeng Weiye&quot;) in July 2017. Construction started and was completed in July 2018. The supervision unit is Jiamusi Sanjiang Construction Supervision Company. It passed the acceptance inspection in July 2020. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2007, Haifeng Weiye was established in Hegang City with investment from Zhu Hai and Zhu Bo (hereinafter referred to as &quot;Er Zhu&quot;). In May 2016, Er Zhu quit the company and 26-year-old Yue Chengqi took over. One year later, the construction of the Yuecheng Plaza complex began, and Haifeng Weiye&#39;s market entity type was changed from &quot;natural person investment or holding&quot; to &quot;natural person sole proprietorship.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A civil judgment with the case number &quot;(2018) Black 0822 Minchu No. 272&quot; shows that before 2016, Haifeng Weiye, who mainly worked on projects in Hegang, was heavily in debt, so he paid annual interest rates Borrow money from Yue Chengqi at 6% interest. In 2016, Erzhu completely gave up Haifeng Weiye and transferred it to Yuecheng Qi. At this time, Zhu Hai and Zhu Bo still owed the Hegang Gongnong District Local Taxation Bureau and the National Taxation Bureau a total of 2,059,920.94 yuan in taxes plus late payment fees. They borrowed money from Yue Chengqi and paid the taxes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In October 2018, Yue Chengqi sued Erzhu for repaying the loan and interest, and received support from the court. However, Erzhu said that he had no money and could not repay it for the time being. This loan totaling 2.42 million yuan was not enforced until 2020. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When he first took over Haifeng Weiye, Yue Chengqi tried many ways to make money, such as purchasing resettlement housing that had been delivered but was resold several times. Later, the court believed that he was purchasing a house. He failed to verify the situation of the actual residents at the time, which constituted a gross negligence. Therefore, his claim for physical ownership of the relocated house is not supported. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He also participated in gambling and ended up with 7,500 yuan in gambling capital. After losing all, he borrowed 10,000 yuan on the spot, with interest of 300 yuan per day. Later, he was caught on the spot by the public security organs on December 2, 2016, his gambling funds were confiscated, and he was subject to administrative penalties. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yue Chengqi&#39;s social software avatar is a picture that says &quot;Life depends on oneself&quot;, and the signature is &quot;What parents give is called background, what one works hard for is called country, there is a kind of hard work called relying on oneself&quot; . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before taking over Haifeng Weiye, Yue Chengqi had no experience in managing construction companies or large-scale construction projects. But through hard work, he used a Hegang construction company that was being enforced for debt arrears to take over the Yuecheng Plaza, a star project in Hunan County with an investment of 170 million yuan. After that, Haifeng Weiye became a major tenderer of Huanan County Government. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After sorting out the public bidding information, &quot;Southern Weekend&quot; concluded: &quot;(Haifeng Weiye) has participated in a wide variety of projects. In terms of municipal engineering, it has undertaken the construction of public parking lots, roads, high-speed rail parking lots, etc., as well as medical projects There are the county CDC, the infectious disease area of ​​the county hospital, and the 120 emergency center, as well as the beautiful rural infrastructure construction in Huanan County, the material reserve warehouse of the county power supply bureau, and the black soil transfer earthwork in the pig slaughtering plant area of ​​​​Huanan Economic Development Zone. In addition, we also won the bid for the county&#39;s affordable housing project.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the night of the accident, Yue Chengqi gave a brief interview to Southern Weekend. He said that he was already aware of the stadium collapse incident, but was not sure if it was his own project. &quot;I need to go back and check the information.&quot; The next day, Yue Chengqi&#39;s mobile phone continued to go unanswered. In the afternoon of the same day, Jiamusi issued a notice confirming that Haifeng Weiye was responsible for the stadium collapse.

Huanan County issued a red snow warning signal at 16:47 that day, prompting the suspension of classes and businesses (except for special industries) if necessary. According to meteorological monitoring, the snowfall in Hunan County, where the incident occurred, reached 44 mm in 24 hours on the 6th, breaking the November snowfall record. Just two days ago, the county held a working meeting on preventing and responding to the current extreme weather, requiring various industries and fields to do their own safety precautions according to the division of responsibilities and minimize the occurrence of secondary disasters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 07 Nov 2023 20:55:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[专访港交所前行政总裁李小加：互联互通是香港资本市场成功的基石]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260126]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-07 20:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Li Xiaojia is known as &quot;one of the earliest practitioners of the reform and opening up of China&#39;s financial securities industry.&quot; While working at the famous Wall Street law firm Davis Polk &amp;amp; Wardwell and Brown &amp;amp; Wood, he was invited by &lt;span>;China&#39;s Ministry of Finance&lt;/span>; to participate in China&#39;s first global sovereign debt transaction.

&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;你曾牵头参与我国第一次发行全球主权债，这次发行全球主权债的主要难点是什么？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;李小加：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;发债首先需要一家大评级机构给中国主权进行信用评级。我参与评级工作的两个多月时间，非常紧张。如果评级不合适，中国根本不会发行主权债。其中发生了很多故事。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;经过艰苦努力，1993年，中国拿到A级主权评级，次年年初发债成功。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;你也牵头主持了首批央国企跨境上市，当时主要为了解决什么问题？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;李小加：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;那时的诉求非常简单，就是为国企解困。当时大量国企非常困难，三角债严重。最主要的动因是国企改革，需要融资，依靠资金进行改革。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;国企改革就要真正进入市场，按市场经济规律运行。在这个过程中，大家很快感觉到，通过上市本身融资，很容易把大家的思想统一起来。然后把境外上市作为一种催化剂，要想去境外融资，央国企就要做各种改革，政府功能、社会功能和企业功能要分开。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这些改革在央国企海外上市的过程中慢慢变得重要。它是靠融资把大家的认知统一起来，为了达到这个目的，让大家慢慢接受改革必须承受的一些成本、一些影响和冲击。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;以海外上市促改革，是否达到了预期目标？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;李小加：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;那当然了。首先，这个目的或者说整体益处是多边的。企业本身在最关键的时候融到大笔资金。 1993 年，首批9 家企业，很快有22 家企业。这些企业用海外融资做了大量资本开支，解决了大量发展中需要的资金问题。它非常及时地解决了当时资金的迫切需求。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;央国企跨境上市真的吹响了国企改革的号角，带动和催发了原来启动相当困难的各个方面体制和机制改革。海外上市之后，国企改革慢慢进入到主赛道。大家开始全面接受国企改革。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;不仅如此，央国企跨境上市很快催生了中国资本市场的发展。我们这么多企业不可能全部到国外上市，而且中国这么多资本，老百姓也有钱。为什么我们的资本不能投入到我们自己的企业里呢？从发行人的角度及投资者希望参与改革开放的发展红利来看，它促进了中国资本市场的诞生和发展。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;还有一点也很重要，央国企第一次走向世界。外界开始认识中国企业，认识中国经济。然后外资由于投资，深度关心、参与和体验中国经济现代化。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;你觉得我国央国企内部治理效率方面的提升空间有多大？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;李小加：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;国企也好，央企也好，只是所有权的一种形式。新加坡也有主权基金，但它的运作方式完全市场化，除了出资人身份以外，其他与私营企业一样的运作模式。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;有的央企也非常高效。要说效率提升，管理者激励机制和其它企业一样吗？我们不能以企业所有权形式简单地说哪个更有效，哪个更好。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“&lt;strong>;世界已经基本上不可能脱钩了&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;现在，一批央国企可能要从纽交所退市。你怎么看目前这种形势？是否有可能走向“资本脱钩”？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;李小加：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;即便退市，和资本脱钩这个事，依然是相差得太远的事情。它们是如今国际资本参与中国市场发展中极小的少数。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;现在，全世界投资到中国的外资体量如此之大，包含范围是主要民企和在香港上市的央国企。除了科技领域比较明显的脱钩外，其他方面的脱钩会有一些。但完全还没有到老死不相往来的程度。我们已经习惯了与一个高度发达的资本市场之间的相互渗入和连接。现在这个连接比它鼎盛期间已弱了很多。如果从二三十年前看如今，今天这个世界的相连已经基本上不可能脱钩了。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;全世界像一驾飞机一样，世界经济最大的两个引擎怎么可能脱钩？在极其深度密切合作的20 年后，目前有一些回撤。即便在回撤之后，两国的经济联系远不能用脱钩这样的字形容。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;“港交所改革的两大核心考量&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;：&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;对内地的历史价值和现实意义”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;执掌港交所10年，你主导了多项影响深远的改革。你对哪些改革更满意？ Why? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;李小加：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;我平常不这么想问题。在历史大潮中，一个人刚好很幸运地在一个很重要很合适的位置上，然后天时地利人和的条件下做了一些事情。这些不能说成一个人的事情。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;任职港交所期间，哪项改革对内地更有历史价值和现实意义？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;李小加：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;这是港交所所有改革最主要的两个核心考量。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这个大主题就是香港在很长时间作为一种国际市场，应该是帮助内地资本市场国际化，帮助国际市场更多融入内地。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;从这个角度讲，每一件事情都要系统性地解决。毕竟这两个市场是两个完全不同的体系，既有极大动力互相融入和互联互通，也有它很强大的内在机制和力量。这使互联互通非常困难。换言之，这两个市场各有自己的管理体制、市场体制和运作方式，愿意融合，但又不愿意为了融合而大量改变自己的制度和系统。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;怎么利用香港极其独特的地位呢？我们充分认识到两边市场哪些可以为了互联互通进行一些改变，哪些是不可能改变的，哪些改变是必须的。找到一个最大公约数和最小公倍数，找到在最小成本里边达到最大幅度的互联互通。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在所有改革中，我们要考虑很多问题。也许某种形式的互联互通最有效最好，但它的成本可能太高。大家不愿意承受；一些事情可能很容易改革，但没什么特别大意义。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;如，我们开始想选择很小的事情，比如说两边交易所的交易时间段不一样，开市和收盘都不一样。看上去似乎很小的事情，但改革并不容易。它涉及两地不同的生活习惯和工作习惯。看起来大家应该没有什么争议的改革，实际上却是当时最困难的改革之一。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;回过头看，以下几件改革对港交所有重大历史价值和现实意义。首先，港交所不能只是在香港的内地市场，港交所不仅只在亚洲，应该往欧美突破，因为内地希望通过香港市场走向国际；不能只在股票市场，要向内地最需要的大宗商品市场突破。因此，港交所兼并收购了伦敦金属交易所，也尝试过收购伦敦交易所，但没有成功。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;第二是港交所股票市场本身。因为监管规则，中国科技企业一直无法上市。它们代表先进的生产力，却只能到美国上市。并不是之前的监管逻辑错误，但在全世界都在竞争的时候，我们为什么死死抱住原有的东西不改变呢？美国的监管逻辑原来也和港交所一致，但它可以找到非常现实的原因并允许改变。我们最后进行改革，小米、京东、阿里等等都可以回归到港交所。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A股市值已高居全球第二。这么庞大的市场与香港市场及国际市场怎么能够实现互联互通，但又不改变双方各自的规则和制度？因此，沪港通、深港通、债券通、债券互换通等等一系列改革创新陆续出笼。两个市场之间达到基本互联互通功能。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;国际化、拥抱新经济、实现互联互通，直到今天都还是香港市场成功的基石，也是中国资本市场走向世界的改革创新。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;你对任职港交所期间的工作还留有遗憾吗？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;李小加：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;现在互联互通是二级市场，即沪港通和深港通可以南下或北上买卖已在港交所或深交所与沪交所的股票。但互联互通没有向一级市场延伸到“新股通”。这是我的遗憾。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这个产品的名字，我以前用“新股通”。新股通让中国市场最终和世界资源对接。在香港实现互联互通，能实现巨大的发展。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;“&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;&lt;span>;让国际&lt;/span>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;&lt;span>;资本&lt;/span>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;&lt;span>;和中国小微&lt;/span>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;&lt;span>;企业充分&lt;/span>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;&lt;span>;联通&lt;/span>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;&lt;span>;”&lt;/span>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;告别港交所，你以一种全球最新的投资模式和交易模式开始创业——2023年8月正式运营滴灌通澳交所。滴灌通澳交所要解决世界性难题——小微企业融资难。为何滴灌通澳交所可以解决这个难题？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;李小加：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;滴灌通澳交所是全球首个持牌的收入分成产品（DRO）交易所。滴灌通的愿景与使命是将国际资本与中国小微经济充分联通起来，要让国际传统金融和中国小微经济这两个非常难以兼容的运营体系实现互联互通。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这件事情能突破的基础和前提是中国数字化革命全面普及。无现金社会为一种崭新的、革命性的融资形式提供了可能。有了这个革命性的前提后，加上我们自己创建的滴灌通澳交所，就把这事做成了。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;万一我们没做，或者万一我们没把它搞好，一定很快就会有其他人把它搞好做起来。就像没有互联网的时候，马云跳到天上去，他啥也干不了。有了互联网以后，他就做了淘宝，但是很快也有了京东、美团等等。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;并不是我们带来了灵丹妙药，一下子破解了大家的难题。只能说我们是第一个。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;为什么你们会成为第一个？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;李小加：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;大部分从事金融的人，看不上小微生意，认为这是不可能的；从事互联网或数字化的大部分人不了解金融的本质。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;为什么能做呢？我们知道，全世界的资本市场主要解决两个问题，一是投资的信息准确和真实，一是投资的钱和货进出的安全有保证。具体而言，全世界投资者只会投资股票或债券，而且是大公司的股票和债券，因为投资者关心的上述两个核心问题是投资的前提。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;传统交易所为解决这两个问题，依靠大量的专业人士做研究报告、做年报等等；交收安全则依靠银行、券商和交易所一系列机构背书，保证资金进出安全保障。但这两件事件都极其昂贵。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在这种情况下，小微企业不会通过上市和发债融资。但在中国数字化革命的当下，这两个核心问题可以低成本解决了。一个小店的收入，在支付体系里完全体现出来，即信息的准确。我们就在收入上做文章，我投资你，买你的收入行不行？从收入中分一笔行不行？ &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;关于投资进出保障的问题，我们在支付体系里直接扣款，直接在银行分账体系扣款。交收安全问题就解决了。华尔街金融体系里面解决的两个核心大功能，我们通过小芯片就解决了。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;解决这个问题不是做慈善，是实实在在把回报拿回来。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;最近有个别人质疑这个商业模式。几乎与此同时，澳交所获得伊斯兰教律监管委员会认证。澳门金管局行政委员会委员刘杏娟也表示，将秉持“风险为本”的监管原则对澳交所进行日常监控。这种创新模式的法律监管是什么样的？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;李小加：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;投资链条非常清晰：滴灌通通过海外机构进行募资，通过外商直接投资在内地联合经营开店。目前涉及的监管包括有四个国家和地区相关法律：中国内地作为一种民事法律关系有相关法律法规、中国香港证监会监管、中国澳门金融监管条例的相关条款，认购产品的国际投资人这块，受英国法律监管。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;获取更多RSS：&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot;

&lt;p>;11月7日下午4点多，迟夙生告诉南方周末记者，宣威法院院长陈永福在当天下午1点左右到医院看望她，并在3点多归还了她的手机。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;两张照片&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;2023年11月6日上午8点40分左右，距开庭还有20分钟，迟夙生抵达法庭。她向南方周末记者回忆，现场只有一名书记员，合议庭成员、检察官和其余律师都还没到。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这是一起涉黑案重审一审开庭的第二十一天。此前，该案已经历一审、二审。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2021年12月10日，宣威法院一审判决，认定涉案的刘顺平等10人不构成黑社会性质犯罪，但存在以刘顺平为首要分子、组织成员经常纠集在一起，共同实施寻衅滋事、敲诈勒索、非法拘禁行为，被认定为恶势力犯罪集团。刘顺平按照集团所犯的全部罪行数罪并罚，其余人员按照其所参与的犯罪行为被处罚。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一审判决后，刘顺平等人不服，提出上诉。检察机关未抗诉。 2022年12月9日，曲靖中院二审以“部分事实不清”为由裁定撤销原判，发回重审。案件重审期间，宣威市检察院追加了3项罪名补充起诉，并仍指控刘顺平等人涉嫌黑社会性质犯罪。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;进入法庭后，迟夙生注意到被告人席位上并排摆放的10张黑色铁制审讯椅，带有固定手脚的装置。在这天前，此案庭审时被告人坐的一直是常规带靠背的木制椅，手脚可以自由活动。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在她的经验中，这种状况并不常见。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;依据《中华人民共和国人民法院法庭规则》（以下简称”法庭规则”），除认为被告人人身危险性大，可能危害法庭安全外，法院在庭审活动中不得对被告人使用戒具。迟夙生下意识地举起手机，拍了两张审讯椅的照片。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;之后，她走出法庭，将手机存放到法庭外的铁皮柜内，为开庭做准备。这时，代理此案的其余律师陆续进场。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;迟夙生和另两名代理此案的律师均表示，从此案开庭的第一天开始，法院就口头要求他们不能带手机进入法庭。曾有律师对此提出异议，认为法庭规则只规定了不得拨打或接听电话等，并没有禁止携带手机，法院未对此作出回应。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;4次沟通&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;迟夙生没想到，因为庭前拍摄的照片，此后她的手机被法院扣留。整个过程中，她同法院工作人员有4次沟通。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;开庭前，迟夙生把手机存入铁皮柜不久，就被法警叫至法庭外。据她回忆，一名法院工作人员要求她删除照片。她拒绝了这个要求。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;法庭规则规定，全体人员在庭审活动中不得对庭审活动进行录音、录像、拍照或使用移动通信工具等传播庭审活动，违反这项规定的，法院可以暂扣其使用的设备及存储介质，删除内容。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;迟夙生认为，自己拍照时庭审还没开始，没有违反法庭纪律。随后，她回到法庭。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;上午10时20分左右，庭审中场休息20分钟。迟夙生被要求留在法庭内，其余律师均不被允许进入法庭。她记得，审判长提出要暂扣她的手机，书记员在现场做了记录。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;第三次沟通发生在开庭期间。下午庭审时，轮到迟夙生发言，她继续申请返还她的手机。她强调，自己是在法庭尚未宣布开庭前拍摄照片，扣押她手机的行为毫无道理。她还表示，如果法院要扣押她的手机，需提供书面材料。审判长则表示，如果合议庭有违法违规的行为，迟夙生可以向上反映情况。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;下午6点15分左右，法庭休庭。迟夙生来到法庭外的铁皮柜处取手机时，发现手机已经不在柜内。此时她已经一天没有使用手机。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;上周，迟夙生接到通知，这起本计划于11月8日结束庭审的涉黑案开庭将延长一个月。她急着和其他法院协调开庭时间，“我就特别着急，喊审判长&amp;nbsp;&#39;把手机还给我呀&#39;。审判长说&#39;丢了你就报警吧&#39;。”两名在场律师均向南方周末记者证实听到了这一对话。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;迟夙生返回法庭，希望再找人交涉此事。随后，她感到“全身发软，站不住了”，躺在了律师席的椅子上。当天晚上7点半，迟夙生被送至宣威市第一人民医院急诊科就诊。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;11月7日，刘顺平等人涉黑案继续开庭审理。迟夙生未能到庭。她已在当天下午出院，打算休息一段时间，检查身体状况。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 07 Nov 2023 19:25:02 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
