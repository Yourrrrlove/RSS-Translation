As the plane landed at Hangzhou Xiaoshan International Airport, Syrian President Bashar Assad&#39;s visit to China officially began. This is Assad’s first visit to China in 19 years since 2004. During this trip, Bashar will also attend the opening ceremony of the Hangzhou Asian Games. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;China and Syria are both countries with ancient civilizations. From their connection through the “Silk Road” to the connection between the “Belt and Road” initiative and Syria’s “Look East” strategy, economic and cultural exchanges between China and Syria have continued to deepen. In fact, friendly relations will become stronger over time. What is the deep meaning behind Assad’s visit to China? How can China-Syria relations be further developed? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Recently, Sun Degang, director of the Center for Middle East Studies at Fudan University, and Wang Jin, associate professor at the Institute of Middle East Studies at Northwest University, pointed out to Nandu and N video reporters that Bashar’s visit to China not only hopes that China will continue to work on the reconstruction process of Syria There are also economic considerations in playing an active role. Wang Jin also emphasized that future exchanges and mutual learning between civilizations will be an important basis for people-to-people exchanges between China and Syria and an important guarantee for the development of bilateral relations. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;“This visit to China will help deepen political mutual trust between the two countries”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;According to the Syrian National News Agency, Bashar led a high-level delegation in On September 21, he set off for a visit to China and participated in relevant activities in Beijing and Hangzhou. Nandu reporters noticed that Bashar’s last visit to China was in 2004, which was also the first visit to China by a Syrian head of state since the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Syria in 1956. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/24/c2fb9eec2add497b898cc7fa7ac85d2d.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;432&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/24/c2fb9eec2add497b898cc7fa7ac85d2d.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;251764&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span>;Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Xinhua News Agency/AP&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;China and Syria have a profound friendship. Syria was one of the first Arab countries to establish diplomatic relations with the People&#39;s Republic of China and one of the sponsors of the restoration of China&#39;s lawful seat in the United Nations. Since the establishment of diplomatic relations 67 years ago, China-Syria relations have maintained healthy and stable development. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“The diplomacy of the heads of state plays a leading role in the development of China-Syria relations.” Sun Degang believes that China and Syria have the same views on safeguarding national sovereignty and territorial integrity, and also have a common understanding of the multi-polar pattern. Diplomacy has played an overt role in deepening practical cooperation between the two sides in many fields.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before this visit to China, Bashar had already visited Iran last year, and this year visited Oman, Russia, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia and China are the sixth stop of his visit since the civil war broke out in 2011. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After 19 years, Assad visits China again. What is the deep meaning behind it? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Currently, the world is undergoing major changes unprecedented in a century, and global peace and development are facing increasing uncertainties and unstable factors. Against the background of the &quot;reconciliation wave&quot; emerging in the Middle East, Sun Degang believes that the Syrian President&#39;s visit to China will help deepen political mutual trust between the two countries. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Bashar’s visit to China is first of all hoping to receive political support from China, including continuing to support Syria in safeguarding national sovereignty and territorial integrity, and continuing to play an active and constructive role in Syria’s reconstruction process. , to properly promote the reconstruction process in Syria.&quot; Wang Jin analyzed to the Nandu reporter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2011, the Syrian civil war broke out. Iran firmly supported the Bashar al-Assad government. The League of Arab States (hereinafter referred to as the &quot;Arab League&quot;) suspended Syria&#39;s membership. Saudi Arabia and many other Arab countries closed their offices in Syria. embassy, ​​Syrian diplomacy has entered a state of relative isolation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/24/0fdbc92fb640cd041da104ad87aabb0d.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;427&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/24/0fdbc92fb640cd041da104ad87aabb0d.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;251765&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span>;The war-torn town of Deir ez-Zor in eastern Syria, taken on September 10, 2013. Xinhua News Agency/AFP&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Under this situation, China has always maintained relations with Syria and defended fairness and justice in global human rights governance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“China and Syria have a very solid foundation of political mutual trust.” This year marks the tenth anniversary of the joint construction of the “Belt and Road” initiative. Sun Degang told Nandu reporters that Syria has always supported China’s “Belt and Road” initiative and the global development initiatives and global security initiatives, and firmly supports China on the South China Sea, Xinjiang-related issues and other issues; China also firmly supports Syria in safeguarding national sovereignty and territorial integrity, has upheld justice on many occasions in relevant votes of the United Nations Security Council, and defended Syria&#39;s national sovereignty and territorial integrity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Nandu reporter learned that as a permanent member of the Security Council, most of the vetoes used by China in relevant votes of the Security Council are related to the Syrian issue. China has always spoken out fairly and acted in accordance with the merits and in safeguarding the interests of the Syrian people. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;The &#39;reconciliation tide&#39; in the Middle East has brought peace dividends to Syria&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;On March 10 this year, Saudi Arabia and Iran reached the &quot;Beijing Agreement&quot;. The three parties signed and issued a joint statement announcing that Saudi Arabia and Iran agreed to resume diplomatic relations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;China is a sincere friend of Arab countries, and Chinese wisdom is constantly recognized by Arab countries. On April 29, when meeting with Zhai Jun, the Chinese government’s special envoy for the Middle East, Assad congratulated China on successfully mediating the resumption of diplomatic relations between Saudi Arabia and Iran, and believed that reconciliation between Saudi Arabia and Iran would have an important and positive impact on the international pattern and regional situation. Syria thanks China for its active work in promoting Syria to improve relations with other Arab countries, and welcomes China to play a greater role in maintaining regional peace and stability. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During the Syrian civil war, Saudi Arabia announced its severing of diplomatic relations with Syria in 2012 due to its opposition to the Assad government. Two months after Saudi Arabia resumed diplomatic relations with Iran this year, Saudi Arabia and Syria also announced on May 9 that the two countries had resumed diplomatic relations. Sun Degang told Nandu reporters that China has promoted the normalization of relations between Saudi Arabia and Iran, driving a &quot;tide of reconciliation&quot; in the Middle East and bringing peace dividends to Syria. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“With the resumption of diplomatic relations between Saudi Arabia and Iran, Syria’s relations with Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Turkey and other countries have further improved, and Syria’s external living space has been greatly improved. This will also help to enhance China-Syria relations, Deepen bilateral cooperation,&quot; he said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On May 10, Bashar was invited to attend the Arab League Summit Council meeting in Saudi Arabia. On May 22, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said that China congratulated President Bashar on attending the Arab League Summit Council meeting and on the reunion of the Arab family. Syria&#39;s return to the Arab League fully demonstrates that Arab countries&#39; strengthening of unity and cooperation through dialogue and consultation is the aspiration of the people and the general trend. It also fully demonstrates that Arab countries have the ability to take their future and destiny into their own hands. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Jin believes that China’s global security initiative has effectively promoted world peace and development. “We hope to form a new security concept around the world that does not sacrifice mutual security. Rather, they are concerned about each other&#39;s security and form a bond of common interests in cooperation.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;China and Syria have economic cooperation advantages&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;2011 After the turmoil in Syria, the economic and trade cooperation between China and Syria was affected. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2022, the bilateral trade volume between China and Syria will be US$427 million, a year-on-year decrease of 11.65%. Among them, China’s imports were US$20 million, a year-on-year increase of 124%; China’s exports were US$425 million, a year-on-year decrease of 11.93%. China mainly exports mechanical and electrical products, light industrial products, etc. to Syria. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Jin admitted to Nandu reporters that due to the long-term sanctions imposed by Western countries, there are certain difficulties in cooperation between Syria and China, and it is necessary to understand rationally and steadily promote economic and trade cooperation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to his observation, the prospects for China-Syria economic and trade cooperation are very broad. &quot;Syria is rich in natural resources such as oil and has a superior geographical location. It is adjacent to the Mediterranean Sea and is an important bridge connecting Europe and Asia. Therefore, China and Syria have very great economic cooperation advantages.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Nandu reporters noted that previous meetings There is no shortage of products from Syria at the CIIE. Damask rose is one of the oldest rose species in the world, and the essential oil extracted from it is called &quot;liquid gold&quot; by locals. At the CIIE booths, in addition to the fragrance of rose essential oil, there are also Syrian products such as olive oil and castile soap. Many Syrian companies feel the potential of the Chinese market at the CIIE. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;China-Syria relations have a long history. Aleppo and Palmyra in Syria were important cities on the ancient Silk Road. On January 12, 2022 local time, China and Syria formally signed the &quot;Memorandum of Understanding on Jointly Promoting the Construction of the Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road&quot;, and Syria officially joined the &quot;Belt and Road&quot; family. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Syrian political analyst and author Kosay Abido believes that the cooperation agreement between the two countries can be expanded to areas such as food, pharmaceuticals and technology. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Under the new historical conditions, China’s “One Belt, One Road” initiative is aligned with Syria’s “Look East” strategy. China’s participation in Syria’s economic reconstruction has become deeper and more substantial, and China-Syria relations have reached a new level. steps. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Currently, the Syrian government forces have controlled most of the land, and post-war reconstruction is on the agenda. I think the Syrian President&#39;s visit to China will focus on cooperation with China in practical fields.&quot; Sun Degang analyzed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Nandu reporters noticed that the Syrian Minister of Economy and Foreign Trade was also among the Syrian delegation visiting China. In this regard, Sun Degang believes that this reflects Syria&#39;s hope that China will leverage its infrastructure advantages in the reconstruction process of Syria, including transportation, electricity and other infrastructure construction. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;If the economically powerful Gulf Arab countries are willing to provide financial support to Syria, and China leverages its infrastructure advantages, relevant cooperation can steadily promote Syria&#39;s economic and social reconstruction.&quot; He said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, Syria had already shown its willingness to seek economic cooperation with China before visiting China. According to reports from the Syrian Arab News Agency and the Russian Satellite News Agency, on April 29 this year, when Bashar met with Zhai Jun, he specifically mentioned that it was becoming increasingly necessary to abandon the use of the U.S. dollar and that trade between countries could be settled in RMB. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Jin analyzed to reporters from Nandu that Syria’s visit to China also has economic considerations. &quot;Syria also hopes that China will provide more economic support and assistance, especially welcoming more Chinese investors to invest in Syria and participate in Syria&#39;s socio-economic reconstruction.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On February 6 this year, southern Turkey approached Two strong earthquakes occurred in the Syrian border area within 12 hours, and China actively provided assistance. &quot;China will also be an important force in improving people&#39;s livelihood in Syria in the future.&quot; Sun Degang believes that the Syrian President&#39;s visit to China, in addition to deepening political mutual trust and strengthening economic and trade exchanges, will also help China and Syria strengthen cooperation in health, education, sports and other fields. . &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;“Exchanges and mutual learning between civilizations will be an important basis for people-to-people exchanges between China and Syria”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;It is worth noting that Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Hua Chunying said on 9 It was announced on March 21 that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad will attend the opening ceremony of the 19th Asian Games in Hangzhou. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Asian Games is a sports event for Asian youth and an important platform for cultural exchanges. &quot;This is a very important moment.&quot; Wang Jin believes that Assad&#39;s attendance at the opening ceremony of the Asian Games will bring important opportunities for people-to-people diplomacy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Leaders gather at this international cultural and sports event to share each other’s views, and head-of-state diplomacy also adds luster to this international event.” He said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sports represents youth, health, and vitality, and is related to people&#39;s happiness and the future of the nation. It is reported that the Syrian team will participate in six competitions including wrestling, boxing, and weightlifting at this Asian Games. Athletes from China and Syria gathered together to add color to the diversity of the Asian Games. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;The Syrian president&#39;s coming to China to attend the opening ceremony of the Asian Games has sent a signal - he hopes that China and Syria can strengthen cooperation in the humanities field.&quot; Sun Degang told the Nandu reporter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;China and Syria are both ancient civilizations. The exchanges between the two countries were connected by the &quot;Silk Road&quot; and continue to this day. The &quot;Silk Road&quot;, called the &quot;Road of Semiramis&quot; by the ancient Assyrians, started in China and passed through the land of Syria to Europe and the Maghreb region. The Syrian Minister of Culture once said that this road has enabled the Syrian people and the Chinese people to get to know each other and established a bridge for cultural exchanges. Customs, beliefs, and lifestyles have also influenced each other. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Today, ancient Chinese silk fabrics and ancient porcelain are collected in museums in Syria. The &quot;Stele of Popular Chinese Nestorianism in the Qin Dynasty&quot; collected by the Xi&#39;an Forest of Steles Museum in China has ancient Syrian inscriptions... each piece is precious. Cultural relics bear witness to the long history of cultural exchanges and mutual learning between the two countries. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/24/cf852266838b78b9744c286623c27e8d.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/24/cf852266838b78b9744c286623c27e8d.png&quot; data-key=&quot;251766&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span>;Recently, the &quot;Syrian Ancient Cultural Relics Exhibition&quot; was displayed at the Guangdong Provincial Museum. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On July 20 this year, the &quot;Syrian Ancient Cultural Relics Exhibition&quot; co-organized by the Guangdong Provincial Museum and the China Cultural Relics Exchange Center was displayed at the Guangdong Provincial Museum. The exhibition brings together 210 pieces/sets of exquisite cultural relics from 9 Syrian museums including the National Museum in Damascus and the Aleppo Museum, as well as 4 Chinese museums including the Dunhuang Academy, the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Museum, the Xi&#39;an Forest of Steles Museum and the Guangdong Provincial Museum. It paints a picture of the magnificent civilization and history of ancient Syria. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Jin told reporters from Nandu that China and Syria are both countries with ancient civilizations, and exchanges and mutual learning between civilizations are of great significance to China and Syria. &quot;Both countries advocate dialogue among civilizations. In recent years, China has proposed the principle of exchanges and mutual learning among civilizations, which has been welcomed and supported by Syria and recognized by the Syrian government and people.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;China-Syria relations have been affected by the rise of Eastern civilization. The common attributes are closely linked, and the two countries have great potential for cultural cooperation. Syria actively appreciates China&#39;s global civilization initiative, which promotes mutual respect among different civilizations and breaks down the &quot;clash of civilizations theory&quot;, &quot;civilization superiority theory&quot; and &quot;Western civilization-centered theory&quot;. In Sun Degang’s view, China-Syria cultural exchanges are a vivid reflection of China’s global civilization initiative. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;In the future, exchanges and mutual learning among civilizations will be an important basis for people-to-people exchanges between China and Syria, and an important guarantee for the development of relations between the two countries. They will add luster to exchanges and mutual learning among world civilizations,&quot; Wang Jin said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 24 Sep 2023 12:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[羊奶、牦牛奶、骆驼奶……小众奶有号称的那么神奇吗？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257529]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-24 11:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Recently, the Shanghai Consumer Protection Commission selected 32 liquid milks with high sales for evaluation, including I don’t know if the results of some niche milk products may surprise you. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In recent years, with the development of the economy and the diversification of consumer demand, there are more and more milk varieties on the market. In addition to cow&#39;s milk, there are also goat milk, and the uncommon buffalo milk, &quot;Niche milk&quot; such as yak milk and camel milk. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On social media, these &quot;niche milks&quot; are claimed to have miraculous properties. For example, camel milk is said to be rich in high-quality protein, vitamins, calcium, iron, amino acids, taurine and folic acid. Regular consumption of camel milk can enhance human immunity and delay aging. The drinks of centenarians in Xinjiang are indispensable for camel milk. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another example is yak milk. Because yaks are distributed in high-altitude areas in Tibet, Sichuan, and Qinghai and are resistant to cold, low temperatures, and hypoxia, the dairy products they produce are known as &quot;natural concentrated milk.&quot; It is said that yak milk is rich in nutrients, such as lactoferrin, A2 protein, conjugated linoleic acid, etc. In short, it is higher than other cow&#39;s milk. It is said that &quot;drinking one cup of yak milk is worth drinking several cups of ordinary milk.&quot; &quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Under these publicity, &quot;niche milk&quot; has gradually become a new consumer favorite in the dairy market. On an e-commerce platform, the transaction volume of imported plant milk increased by 176% year-on-year in 2019, and the imported goat milk powder increased by more than 50% year-on-year. The market size of yak milk products has increased from 400 million yuan in 2014 to about 1.45 billion yuan in 2019. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So, are these niche milks so magical? This evaluation by the Shanghai Consumer Protection Commission answers this question to a certain extent. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Nutrition refers to the biotin that can be obtained from food and is necessary for the body. When people eat, food enters the body, is digested by the gastrointestinal tract, and absorbs the nutrients in it, supplying energy to the body, forming and renewing body tissues. Nutrition is divided into seven major nutrients: carbohydrates, proteins, fats, vitamins, minerals, water, and dietary fiber. In 1973, an expert committee organized by the WHO confirmed a total of 42 essential nutrients for the human body. Any one of these 42 species cannot be deficient, otherwise related nutritional deficiency diseases will occur. Therefore, whether something is nutritious can be quantified. For dairy products, the main function of drinking milk is to supplement protein and calcium, which are indicators that dairy products must be labeled. Then, the nutritional content of dairy products can be quantified through experiments and quantitative comparisons can be made. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This experiment by the Shanghai Consumer Protection Commission compared 32 niche milks, including 6 buffalo milk, 7 yak milk, 6 camel milk, 6 goat milk and 7 cow milk ( Milk is mostly mid- to high-end products), with prices ranging from 1.5 yuan/100mL to 25.4 yuan/100mL. The results show that the protein content of 32 samples is 3.0g/100mL-4.3g/100mL. Among them, buffalo milk and cow&#39;s milk ranked first and second in protein content, with average values ​​of 4.2g/100mL and 4.0g/100mL respectively. Goat milk had the lowest protein content, with an average value of 3.2g/100mL. In terms of calcium content, camel milk has the highest calcium content, with an average value of 164.0mg/100mL; followed by buffalo milk, with an average value of 152.3mg/100mL; goat milk has the lowest calcium content, with an average value of 123.3mg/100mL. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since it is a commodity, a very important indicator is cost performance. The average price of camel milk is relatively high, reaching 22 yuan/100ml, which is nearly eight times the price of buffalo milk, but there is no obvious advantage in nutritional value. Generally speaking, buffalo milk and cow&#39;s milk have relatively high calcium and protein contents, making them the most cost-effective products. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This result may be unexpected by many people, but it is reasonable. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the modern dairy industry, the breeds of dairy cows are slowly developed through long-term industrial production and technology; the breeding methods are also constantly developing towards improving the nutrition of milk; the cost of feeding is also Gradually reduced in the fierce market competition. This ensures that the milk we usually drink is the most cost-effective. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the niche milk industry is small in scale, relatively backward in development, and naturally not cost-effective. For example, yaks have a low degree of artificial selection and are primitive cattle breeds. Their reproduction mainly relies on free mating within the group, which may lead to population degradation and reduced production performance. The daily milk production of yaks is low and the lactation period is short. The average annual milk production is mainly for feeding calves. Although there is also scientific research and improvement, the investment in a small industry is definitely not much. So, to some extent, yak milk is destined to be expensive. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, to a certain extent, the nutrition of milk is not important, because the same protein and calcium can be obtained in lower-cost ways, such as eating eggs to obtain protein. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, there is a traditional understanding in China that the nutrients are all in the soup. Following this idea, one would think that liquid milk is rich in nutrients. But actually, the nutrients are in the solids. Under normal circumstances, the human body needs about 50 to 60 grams of protein a day. The protein content of 100 grams of protein powder is about 75 grams. In natural food, a pound of pork contains about 100 to 120 grams of protein; a pound of chicken breast has 150 grams of protein; and each ordinary egg contains about 6 grams of protein. In other words, 5 pounds of milk is equivalent to 1 pound of pork, and 7 pounds of milk is equivalent to 1 pound of chicken breast. Milk itself may not be a cost-effective nutritional product. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So, for a healthy person with normal financial status, protein deficiency will not occur. This small difference in the protein content of dairy products is simply unimportant and not worth the extra money.

In this sense, it is of extremely important significance to sociology. The famous sociologist Tu Ergan discussed the relationship between bachelors and suicide, Marx and Engels wrote about the relationship between marriage and profit, love and profit, and Max Weber studied sex, even if these are not the core of their works.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Leave aside society. Study’s persistence in modernity. In fact, Eva Iros&#39;s works are all about her own confusion. A few years ago, when she was still studying for a Ph.D. in the United States, it was her boyfriend&#39;s birthday. However, she was financially strapped and could not afford to invite her boyfriend to a restaurant, so she had to do it herself. &quot;But when I wanted to cook for him, I realized I needed to buy candles, cook some fancy food, and I didn&#39;t even have a tablecloth. To create a romantic dinner atmosphere, I needed to spend money, and I didn&#39;t have any money at the time .&quot; Her first book later published, &quot;The Utopia of Consumer Romance: Love and the Cultural Paradox of Capitalism,&quot; was related to this experience. In the book, she focuses on the close connection between romantic love and consumer culture. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/wO6qeoIC9QkxpJ1sO1z55d0m29hmfIdYK68V3NV0.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;1563&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/wO6qeoIC9QkxpJ1sO1z55d0m29hmfIdYK68V3NV0.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251366&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As an Emotional Society Scientist, Eva Yilos has always been curious about changes in emotional practices and related ideas. In the 19th century, when love entered the public sphere from the family sphere, dating culture also emerged. At that time, European and American romantic literary works focused on describing people&#39;s unremitting pursuit of romantic love - &quot;Madame Bovary&quot; depicts a woman who pursues Romantic love escapes the family several times, but in the end the woman is in debt and has no choice; &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; writes about a pair of childhood sweethearts, Heathcliff and Catherine. Catherine decided to marry Edgar out of the consideration of being well-matched, and Heathcliff felt humiliated. He ran away in anger and returned to the manor a few years later for revenge. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Very different from this, contemporary love is often filled with more rational calculations. Eva Iros believes that the development of Internet technology has destroyed people’s pursuit of romantic love. “We no longer rely on bounty hunters or good luck harvested on Ferris wheels to find love, as we did before, but through cost-benefit analysis. Looking for a match.&quot; Today&#39;s popular dating software is probably the best example, as she wrote in &quot;Cold Intimacy&quot; (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 毷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Chinese translation in 2023 Published in April), &quot;Most of the magic of love is related to the scarcity of the partner&#39;s resources. As the saying goes, scarcity is the most valuable thing. This scarcity will in turn bring surprise and excitement. Compared with Under the circumstances, what dominates the current Internet is a surplus economic system and too many options, which forces the self to make choices and make optimal choices. Internet technology happens to integrate two ways of finding oneself: psychology and consumerism—fueling the need for people to find the best (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: italics, italics_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;financially and psychologically&lt;/span>;) deal for themselves.&quot;&lt; /p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/SyjPK1W4qQR6A6dtbCgz5qYOb9FGYSkoWlffmOpX.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot; 1596&quot; data-src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/SyjPK1W4qQR6A6dtbCgz5qYOb9FGYSkoWlffmOpX.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251365&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Our The interview started from the phenomenon of psychological counseling craze, and talked about the impact of the popularity of dating software on intimate relationships, as well as her role in &quot;The End of Love&quot; (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: italics, italics_GB2312, STKaiti; &quot;>;Chinese translation published in September 2023&lt;/span>;) refers to the &quot;negative structure of contemporary relationships&quot;, that is, &quot;whether freedom undermines the formation of meaningful romantic bonds.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She does not intend to point out that modern love is always unhappy. On the contrary, she summarizes the manifestations of fulfilling the promise of modern love and intimacy - &quot;equality, freedom, the pursuit of sexual satisfaction, gender-neutral care and autonomy&quot; Sex,&quot; arguing that as long as people fulfill the above promise &quot;in heterosexual or homosexual intimate relationships,&quot; their intimate relationships must be happy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“It’s just that,” said Eva Iros, “what is more urgent for a scholar to pay attention to is unhappiness.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http:/ /images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/lshhUuojPVwn97OODu7Ev8YHkfdFWAF2oEgkq28q.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;1440&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com /cms/medias/image/23/09/20/lshhUuojPVwn97OODu7Ev8YHkfdFWAF2oEgkq28q.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251378&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Eva· Yilos sociologist, professor of sociology and anthropology at the Hebrew University of Israel.

The opportunity is often a breakup or setbacks at work or school. They expect to gain a better self through psychotherapy. But this often points to individuals blaming themselves - if the goal is not achieved, then I didn&#39;t work hard enough. You also mentioned in &quot;Cold Intimacy&quot;, &quot;If a woman keeps falling in love with those unpredictable or loveless men, then she can only blame herself. If she does not blame herself, she must at least learn to change herself. &quot;Why do everyone believe in this logic? What does this have to do with neoliberalism? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Eva Ilos: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;You asked a very good question. Why do some narratives have more adherents than others? Why are some narratives so powerful that it is difficult for us to think beyond them or explain what is happening to us? Let me try to give a few different explanations: &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First of all, psychologists and psychoanalysts have long known about organizing themselves into experts through degrees, certifications, and university courses. Through their organizational capabilities, they quickly gained legitimacy as a discipline that sought to heal, improve, and overcome disorders and deficits, perfectly suited to the core missions of modern institutions: to promote progress, promote moral reform, alleviate suffering, Increase happiness. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Second, modern institutions are fundamentally utilitarian, and psychology applies this utilitarian philosophy to the mind. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The third reason lies in the profound changes in society. All social relations tend to be democratized, which sociologists call social roles (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 毷体, 毷体_GB2312, STKaiti ;&quot;>;Reporter&#39;s Note: In sociological theory, &quot;social role&quot; stipulates a specific scope of a person&#39;s activities and the rights, obligations, and behavioral norms that are commensurate with the person&#39;s status. It is society&#39;s behavioral expectations for a person in a specific position&lt; /span>;) no longer plays a fundamental role. That is, people are fathers and husbands, mothers and wives, girlfriends and friends, but they don&#39;t know how to play their roles in them, and all of these roles come with people&#39;s personalities and true selves. This means we no longer have guidelines. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The demand for psychology comes not only from the disappearance of social roles, but also from the disappearance of clear guidelines and authority. Individuals should know from within who they are and what they should do. But the problem is, they often don&#39;t know what to do. Psychology is a practice of dealing with uncertainties: Who am I? what should I do? Should I prioritize happiness or responsibility? In a world pre-ordained by society and the divine universe, the answers to these questions are obvious. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/5RXnjGIsyIRQfkM8GJTfAJCw9jZOMTpqad9p4akl.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;961&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/5RXnjGIsyIRQfkM8GJTfAJCw9jZOMTpqad9p4akl.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251369&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Stills from the movie &quot;Love in the Evening&quot; &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The demise of traditional romantic love&lt;/h4 >; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;One ​​of the changes in modern love is the popularity of dating software, such as Tinder and Hinge , similar software is also very popular in China. People who use dating apps to date often complain about how instrumental it is—you have to introduce yourself and ask the same questions every time you meet someone new. You also mentioned in &quot;Cold Intimacy&quot; that some interviewees expressed a certain boredom and cynicism. Do you think this cynicism marks a radical departure from traditional romantic culture in modern online love? Could you please explain it in detail? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Eva Ilos:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;In 2016, dating app Hinge found that 1 in 500 swipes on the app exchanged phone numbers . That same year, the company further surveyed 300 of its users, revealing that 81% had never found a long-term relationship on any swipe-based dating app ( ;&quot;>;Data comes from &quot;The Atlantic Monthly&quot;&lt;/span>;). However, Internet dating sites have always been extremely profitable because of their ability to commodify the hope of meeting someone, and that hope keeps people willing to continue using them despite feelings of disillusionment. I think this oscillation between disappointment and resilience is at the heart of people&#39;s use of online dating. Yes, I think it does represent some departure from the traditional model of love, but it also wants to preserve the traditional model. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Objectively speaking, traditional romantic love occurs in a small social network. Many times, people know each other, either through their parents or reputation, and belong to the same circle. In comparison, the social relationships of online encounters are more diffuse. Another change is that people’s choices have become incredibly wide. This is completely new and changes the ecology of human relationships. Generally speaking, we develop emotional attachments to others based on what we think is possible. If you live in a village you can only choose from this range. But if the choices expand, you think you have a better choice and quickly move on to the next person. Breaking up is also much less expensive because you think you can find someone who is your equal or better. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Is this departure just influenced by the Internet? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Eva Iros: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Technology cannot operate in a cultural vacuum. Without sexual liberation, people wouldn&#39;t have a variety of partners, and this departure wouldn&#39;t happen. Dating software has achieved and completed sexual liberation, changing the way people used taboos and morals to define sexual behavior in the past. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Imagination has always been a part of romantic love&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 凯体, 凯体_ GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;People who use social software to make friends have a more detailed definition of relationships and have developed many terms, such as hookups and FWB (friends with benefit), which refer to relationships that are both friendships and include sexual relations. They There are no commitments and constraints, and there is no emotional attachment), situationship (referring to the relationship between two people being closer than friends, but not to the level of lovers), etc. Why are modern people’s relationships more fragile and uncertain than in the past? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Eva Iros:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Simply put, it’s because we have the freedom to do what we want with our relationships and ourselves. Individuals are no longer defined by social roles and rules; they must create them themselves, which also creates chaos and uncertainty. Chaos and uncertainty are considered psychological categories, but I think they should also be sociological categories, because many situations in chaos and uncertainty are defined by individuals, and the rules of behavior of individuals are different from those of traditional society. The way things work is often very different. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;The traditional imagination of romantic love is based on the body The attraction is also based on accumulated experience in the past; and the Internet separates imagination from people&#39;s real encounters, allowing the two to occur at different points in time. Therefore, some people often face the dilemma of &quot;turning up as quickly as possible&quot; and then give up the idea of ​​using dating apps to find love. What kind of person can establish a private romantic relationship on the Internet? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Eva Ilos: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I’m not sure we can determine who can establish relationships in the network. Are you talking about being in a relationship with someone you have never met and will never meet? Or is it a relationship that begins online and continues offline? Imagination has always been a part of romantic love, and you will attribute many fictional virtues to the one you love. Sometimes people fall in love with someone they&#39;ve never spoken to. Laura and Petrarch are one of the most famous lovers in the history of the Western Renaissance, but in fact they almost never communicated. Petrarch loved Laura as one would love the Virgin Mary, or, in other words, he loved Laura as a teenager falls in love with a pop singer.

Encounters between opposite sexes became more sexualized, that is, sex was the goal and people&#39;s worth was largely determined based on their sexual attraction. A very attractive woman will have more power in the sexual realm than many men. But overall, the sexual realm is still dominated by powerful men who have control over young, attractive women. Trump and Melania are a classic example of what scholar Paola Tabet calls a heterosexual bargain: women STKaiti;&quot;>;preferably beautiful&lt;/span>;) provides sex, and the man gives her power (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;in the form of money or social connections&lt; /span>;). Traditionally, in the realm of sex, men have power and women have sex, and they trade. In a sexually free marketplace, the situation becomes even more complicated when there are no taboos or prohibitions on people accessing sex. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Modern love advocates love, marriage, and sex Freedom, which emphasizes that people have the freedom to enter into relationships, actually means that people have the freedom to leave relationships. You call it the negative structure of contemporary relationships. Although freedom is often given a positive connotation, this is not necessarily the case in intimate relationships. How do you view the relationship between love and freedom? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Eva Iros: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;The history of freedom is complex. When we talk about freedom, it is mostly seen in terms of political and economic aspects, such as natural human rights. Capitalist markets provide a lot of freedom for the circulation of goods and contracts between workers and capitalists. But there is also a history of emotional freedom that perhaps predates both previous histories: that of the individual&#39;s claim to autonomy from fatherhood, monarchy, and community, in which love plays an important role. Tristan and Isolde or Romeo and Juliet survive in our classics precisely because they illustrate the process by which individuals gain freedom from community. In the West, love and freedom are synonymous, an affirmation of individual autonomy. But this freedom has become what I call the “negative structure of contemporary relationships,” which is the freedom for people to say no and refuse to enter a relationship. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Having studied the sociology of emotions for many years, do you think intimacy Is the only direction for relationships to become more negative and alienated? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Eva Iros:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I think we have higher demands on intimacy now: respect; expression of our true selves; education us; pique our interest. This far exceeds what we expected from it in the past. We get more intimacy from our relationships than we did in the past, but we’re also more attentive to our own emotions and whether we’re being respected—which can make relationships more fluid and easier to ignite ( explosive). &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(Thanks to Chen Meiyi and Huang Qiuye for their help with this article.

Examining this case, which was selected for inclusion in the Supreme People&#39;s Procuratorate&#39;s work report to the National People&#39;s Congress, may help prevent unjust, false and wrong cases from recurring. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to Red Star News, what led to Tan Xiuyi’s injustice was a massacre that occurred in the summer of 1993: On the evening of July 16, 1993, Tan Hong, a villager in Qiantan Village, Tanzhuang Town, Shangshui County, Zhoukou, Henan Province ( A family of three (pseudonym) and his parents were murdered, and Tan Xiuyi, a 39-year-old fellow villager at the time, was identified as a suspect. At the end of 1999, the Zhoukou Intermediate Court made a first-instance verdict on the case and sentenced Tan Xiuyi to a suspended death sentence for intentional homicide. The first-instance verdict shows that the court found that: at about 22:00 on the evening of July 16, 1993, when Tan Xiuyi went home to relieve himself in the toilet, he saw Tan Hong, who was staying at his home that night, and became malicious and raped her. Fearing that the matter would be exposed, Tan Xiuyi had the idea of ​​killing Tan Hong&#39;s parents. At 1 a.m. on July 17, Tan Xiuyi sneaked into Tan Hong&#39;s home with the tools of the crime and killed his parents. Later, Tan Xiuyi was afraid that Tan Hong would doubt him after learning that his parents had been killed, so he killed Tan Hong after she got up and returned home, and hung her body from the beam. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After Tan Xiuyi appealed, in May 2000, the Henan High Court ruled to revoke the original verdict and remand the case for retrial on the grounds that the facts were unclear. In January 2002, the Zhoukou City Intermediate People&#39;s Court made a retrial judgment. In addition to intentional homicide, Tan Xiuyi was also found guilty of rape, and his sentence was maintained with a suspended death penalty. Tan Xiuyi appealed again, but this time the Henan High Court rejected the appeal in 2003 and upheld the original verdict. Ten years later, this tragedy seems to have become an &quot;iron case&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, Tan Xiuyi did not give up. He kept appealing and had his experience rejected: In December 2017, the Henan Provincial High Court ruled that &quot;the facts found in the original judgment were clear, the evidence was indeed sufficient, and the conviction and sentencing were not inappropriate.&quot; dismissed the complaint. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Until 2018, after the Henan Provincial Procuratorate filed the case for review, it believed that the facts determined in the original trial were unclear, the evidence was unreliable and insufficient, and the judgment was wrong. On June 18, 2020, it filed a protest with the Supreme People&#39;s Procuratorate. The Supreme People&#39;s Procuratorate lodged a protest with the Supreme People&#39;s Court on March 16, 2022. Four months later, the Supreme People&#39;s Court made a retrial decision and ordered the Henan High Court to retrial. This time, the Henan High Court changed the verdict of Tan Xiuyi to not guilty. At this time, Tan Xiuyi had been &quot;released&quot; two months ago and had been imprisoned for more than 29 years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The trial process of this case is full of doubts. The case occurred in 1993, but the first-instance verdict was issued more than six years later, and the second-instance verdict was found to be &quot;unclear.&quot; It can be inferred that the investigation process of the case was not smooth and the evidence based on which the case was decided was not sufficient. In this regard, the criminal protest letter of the Supreme People&#39;s Procuratorate also stated: In this case, except for Tan Xiuyi&#39;s partial guilty confession, which is consistent with the investigation transcripts and autopsy reports, there is no objective evidence to prove that Tan Xiuyi committed the crime; for the crime of rape, the time of Tan Xiuyi&#39;s rape cannot be determined, and the rape behavior It is also impossible to prove; regarding the crime of intentional homicide, some of the crime tools are unclear and the conclusions of criminal technical appraisal are not unique. In addition, the Supreme People&#39;s Procuratorate also found that Tan Xiuyi&#39;s several guilty confessions were inconsistent and contradicted other evidence. The Supreme People&#39;s Procuratorate believes that the case also contains problems such as guilty confessions and interrogation transcripts that violate legal provisions and whose authenticity is questionable. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In other words, the evidence in the case basically only consists of Tan Xiuyi’s confession, and there is no objective evidence. Even the authenticity of the confession is doubtful, and the confession may have been illegally coerced. During the second trial, the Henan High Court determined that the facts of the case were unclear and remanded the case for retrial. It can be seen that the second instance also believed that there were problems with the evidence. However, it took just over a year for the retrial to reach another verdict, which not only upheld the crime of intentional homicide, but also added the crime of rape (this is also a doubtful point: since Tan Xiuyi was found to have raped Tan Hong in the first trial in 1999, why was he not punished? Convicted of rape?), and the retrial second instance also upheld the first instance judgment of the retrial. It took six years to obtain enough evidence, but why did it take just over a year to add new evidence that was sufficient to establish the crime? &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Not to mention that homicide cases require sufficient evidence to be determined, rape cases only rely on oral confessions, which is difficult to understand. Regardless of whether it was forced, at least it must be proven that there was sexual intercourse between the victim and the suspect. Although the victim was dead, the rape and murder were only a few hours apart. At that time, the police also mastered DNA comparison technology. Through forensic identification, it was completely possible to find out whether the victim had had sex with the suspect before his death. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Why did the Henan Provincial High Court find that the facts were unclear in the initial second instance, but the second instance of the retrial, as well as the subsequent appeal, all believed that &quot;the facts were clearly found and the evidence was indeed sufficient&quot;? Are the judges who handle retrials, second trials and appeals under pressure from other parties? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The case occurred in 1993, and many trials were held around 2000. Although the Internet was not very developed at that time, a major extermination case that killed a family of three still had a very large impact, and the public prosecutor and the law were bound to be under considerable pressure. What is particularly noteworthy is that Henan was one of the first provinces to propose &quot;murder cases must be solved&quot; at the beginning of this century. In 2004, it was recognized by the Ministry of Public Security as a national slogan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the 2023 National People’s Congress, the Supreme People’s Procuratorate stated in a report that in the past five years, 26 major criminal wrongful convictions, including the Wuzhou case and the Zhang Yuhuan case, had been corrected in accordance with the law; Protests or prosecutorial recommendations for retrials were made in 10 major unjust cases in which the original verdict lasted for more than ten years, and the court changed the verdict to not guilty in all cases. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For these unjust, false and wrong cases, in addition to redressing the grievances and compensating the parties concerned, should the investigators at the time also bear responsibility? In 2013, the Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission issued guidance on effectively preventing unjust, false and wrongful convictions, requiring judges, prosecutors, and people&#39;s police to be lifelong responsible for the quality of case handling within the scope of their duties, and to establish and improve the accountability mechanism for unjust, false and wrongly convicted cases. In 2021, the Supreme People&#39;s Procuratorate, Zhang Jun, once stated that at the beginning of 2021, the Supreme People&#39;s Procuratorate launched a comprehensive investigation into the cases of correction of wrongful convictions since 2018, and has listed and supervised 22 cases of wrongful convictions that were wrongfully detained for more than 10 years, and all proposed serious accountability. Opinion. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Just as the Supreme People&#39;s Procuratorate put forward, &quot;Correction cannot stop at state compensation, and accountability must fall on the responsible party.&quot; Correcting unjust, false and wrong cases cannot stop at overturned cases and compensation, so that there is a sense of justice in the investigation and trial process of the case. Only when responsible personnel take responsibility can judicial fairness and justice be demonstrated. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 23 Sep 2023 23:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[换个角度看大学]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257347]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-23 23:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;Why does school start on September 1st?

A large &quot;The Eighth Suspect&quot; roll-up banner divided the space into two, and a media conducted an interview, asking Lin Jiadong about the cooperation between &quot;The Eighth Suspect&quot; and the director and starring actors. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Perhaps because the appointment took the longest, my interview was scheduled as the last one of the day. I&#39;m worried that he will be tired after the intensive announcements during the promotion period, or his desire to express will weaken (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;This is very normal&lt;/span>;). but no. When the staff and I walked around the roll-up banners, Lin Jiadong turned to look out the floor-to-ceiling window, looking very interested. Outside is the night view of Beijing&#39;s Third Ring Road. There are office buildings with lights on in the darkness, which may be very similar to Hong Kong. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He likes to observe other people&#39;s lives. He said that he likes to sit in a tea restaurant and listen to people gossiping - he imitates how guests and waiters shout in a tea restaurant where people are crowded around tables. He said that if others looked at him, he would look back. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Lin Jiadong, I saw what a good actor looks like. He is not particularly handsome, but the environment in which he lives allows for diverse creations. There is no need to have the appearance of an idol, and there is no need to expose a lot of private life. As a profession, the life of an actor can really be very long. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It seems that there is no age anxiety in him. When he played a supporting role in &quot;Infernal Affairs&quot; 21 years ago, he was already in his thirties (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;he was born in 1967&lt;/span>;), Abandoned the stable path of starring in TVB. Later, he said that it was unbearable to film so many TV series in a year. He has played golden supporting roles in many movies, such as two &quot;Underworld&quot; and &quot;Exile&quot;, &quot;Ip Man&quot;, and &quot;Chill&quot;. He has built a solid foundation step by step. In past interviews, he has always said that he is a boring and boring person. Apart from acting, he rarely talks about his life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It would be better to end this article with a movie. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the appointed time, the interview was coming to an end. After asking the last question, I couldn’t help but ask how they rehearsed the positioning of the long shot in &quot;Hand-Rolled Cigarettes&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is a work in which Jack Lam starred for free and supported new Hong Kong directors. He plays Guan Chao, a former Chinese-American British soldier who is completely unsuitable for the new era. There is a nearly 10-minute long shot at the end of &quot;Hand-Rolled Cigarettes&quot;, which is extremely exciting. The camera looks far away on the rooftop. The gangster Guan Chao worked for before discovered that his betrayal was not just about money, but also hiding the person who stole the gangster&#39;s goods worth tens of millions. Extreme violence occurs in this long shot, where Guan Chao is beaten by a group of thugs. Everyone&#39;s fight was not good-looking, using brute force and deadly strikes. Guan Chao got into a scuffle with someone and was beaten badly. He stumbled from one room to another and was beaten violently by two people from the other party he had offended. He was already dying (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;The camera recorded Guan Chao&#39;s death in real time&lt;/span>;), Guan Chao used his last bit of strength to rush to the camera , and immersed the person who was lying on top of him to restrain him into the water tank. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Our action director arranged it first. His martial arts actor did it once. He filmed it and cut it out for me to see. He said, can you do it like this? I remember at that time I said, Director , I’m not young anymore.” Lin Jiadong smiled and repeated, and the director said, “You can do it, Jiadong!”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Okay. Lin Jiadong watched the long shot twice, and everyone rehearsed it twice more. The shooting started. When he shot the first shot, his eye was injured. He went to the hospital and came back to continue filming. He happily recalled the scene at the end of the long scene where Guan Chao dragged the person to the water tank and submerged him. It was very enjoyable. &quot;For this character, he only has these 10 seconds in his life (to fight back like this). That should be his response to life.&quot; Roaring.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 23 Sep 2023 22:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[我放弃改造“扫兴”父母：“人教人很难，事教人一次就会”]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257398]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-23 21:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;When we were young, our parents took us to know the world; when we grow up, we also hope to take our parents to see the world. But our parents’ response often disappoints us. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When I take them on a trip, they mumble along the way, saying, &quot;You spend money to find trouble.&quot; When you take them to enjoy delicious food, they say, &quot;It&#39;s not as good as the food at home.&quot; You buy them down jackets and furs. A coat, they say, is &quot;not as light and warm as a cotton-padded jacket&quot;... Every time I happily do this or that for my parents, I always get thrown cold water on it, which makes me feel annoyed. Sometimes I will show it out and quarrel with my parents, saying, &quot;The dog bites me.&quot; Lu Dongbin——I don’t know the good heart.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Recently, the discussion on the Internet about &quot;parents who are not a spoiler&quot; has attracted a lot of attention. The negative example is my parents. The positive teaching material is to happily accept the kindness of their children, and their children will take them to eat. Enjoy it and say &quot;It&#39;s delicious.&quot; When your children buy clothes for them, they put them on immediately and say &quot;It looks good.&quot; Your children order takeout and happily follow it to taste... There are also people who take their parents to &quot;swear&quot; before taking them shopping: &quot;I am determined not to waste money, I am determined not to spend money to find trouble, and I am determined not to eat junk food again...&quot; I feel very sad! So I forwarded these short videos to my mother to see, hoping that she would change. She immediately said, &quot;You have to pretend to like it even if you don&#39;t like it?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I really had nothing to say. I have to admit that she is right. Rational analysis shows that these short videos, on the one hand, capture the emotions of adult children who are disappointed by their parents; on the other hand, for the sake of traffic, they create an image of &quot;parents who are not disappointed&quot; and please the adult children who occupy the mainstream of the Internet population. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is indeed a generation gap between us and our parents. First of all, we have different growth backgrounds and different views on money. My parents’ generation experienced an era of insufficient material wealth, so they are very frugal. Although many people have pensions that exceed their adult children’s salary and have less expenses, they are still reluctant to spend money. As my mother’s famous saying “Saving money is the key to saving money” My greatest pleasure.&quot; In this way, we can understand why uncles and aunts are willing to line up for two hours to receive 10 eggs, and why old people who live in high-end communities are keen to collect scraps and sell them, not only because they have free time, but also because they are used to being frugal. What&#39;s more, the characteristics of their generation have been accurately grasped by scammers, and they often succeed under the guise of &quot;free&quot;. I once advised my mother not to fill in personal information in order to receive the free small fans, small mirrors, and low-quality tissues, so as not to receive countless phone calls or even encounter telecom fraud. But she firmly believed: &quot;It&#39;s free, don&#39;t give it up!&quot; &quot;I just Without spending money, what can he deceive me about?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Most of the behavior of our parents to discourage us is due to our different views on money. Our generation has become accustomed to loans to buy houses, credit card purchases, and &quot;spending money.&quot; &quot;Baitiao&quot;, look for housekeeping and cleaning, and be more frugal, earn ten yuan and spend five yuan... As long as you are comfortable and happy, you should spend money. But they would rather walk five streets under the scorching sun than spend two yuan to take a bus. They can spend two hours taking a bus and wander slowly, so they won&#39;t spend 10 minutes taking a taxi to get there. Therefore, the essence of their disincentive to us is that they are afraid that we will spend money, because we are one family with them. They have experienced a period of material scarcity, have richer life experiences, and understand the ups and downs of life better. They often say that &quot;a penny can stump a hero&quot;, &quot;a long stream of water will keep you from worrying when encountering disasters&quot;, &quot;thinking ahead and looking ahead, you will always have food and clothing&quot; &quot;If you don&#39;t have enough food, you won&#39;t have enough clothes. If you don&#39;t calculate, you will be poor.&quot; &quot;Three years for the new, three years for the old, and three more years for mending.&quot; They save money not only out of habit, but also to fully support us when needed. , let us borrow less when buying a house, pay less every month, and have more money...&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The two generations have different views on money, and it is difficult to distinguish the pros and cons. Although my mother is also aware of the benefits brought by another consumption concept, it is still difficult to overcome the hurdle in her heart. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Think about the changes in our generation&#39;s consumption outlook. It has gone through almost twenty years. From college, we started accepting credit cards, mobile payments, and e-commerce. After working, we started to make rapid progress, buying, buying, buying, and now live broadcasting. After grabbing time, we began to reflect again, burst the consumption bubble, and became more rational... Now we force our parents&#39; generation to immediately keep up with our pace and support our consumption concept 100%. It is really unrealistic. The transformation of parents also needs to be done step by step. We have stepped on the consumption &quot;pits&quot; that we have stepped on before, bought a bunch of cheap and unused small items, been deceived several times, returned the goods several times, and been injured several times. Only then can the mind slowly become enlightened. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;My mother rented out the house and persuaded her to install new furniture. She was not willing to spend money, so she moved the &quot;old antiques&quot; that were no longer needed at home to the rental house. She was not fashionable at all. As a result, many tenants came and did not It looks like it has never been rented out. So, she asked someone to move the &quot;old antiques&quot; and install new furniture. Moving around, owing favors, and delaying renting, I indirectly lost a lot of money, which was far more than the money for new furniture. &quot;It&#39;s hard to teach others, but you can teach them everything once.&quot; She was convinced after he calculated the economic accounts for her through his words. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A few days ago, I saw in my circle of friends that they were going on a &quot;travel&quot;. The so-called &quot;travel&quot; meant visiting various towns and villages under the jurisdiction of our county. They happily told me that due to preferential policies, local residents over sixty years old can ride the bus for free. If they bring a bottle of boiled water and two boiled eggs, they can go out for a day without spending a penny. I suddenly realized that for us, Lijiang, Xinjiang, Tibet, Maldives, and Iceland are poetry and distance, but for them, the surrounding towns and villages are their poetry and distance, and this is a travel experience that is more suitable for their &quot;physical constitution.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Our parents grew up with us and took the trouble to teach us to understand and experience small things one by one. As we grow older with our parents, we must also change our mentality, stop being harsh, and patiently accompany our parents to &quot;grow&quot; together. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From then on, I gave up trying to reform my &quot;disappointing&quot; parents. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(The author is a middle school teacher in Tianjin)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>; •&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;(The &quot;hi, Southern Weekly&quot; column of Southern Weekend App is looking forward to your contributions.

Heavy rains of 150 to 240 millimeters caused severe flooding in many cities. The port city of Derna was particularly severely affected. The wind waves in the city center were as high as 20 feet. Two old dams on the Wadi Derna river in the upper reaches collapsed. After the floods raged, almost no intact building could be found in the entire city, and some residents were swept into the Mediterranean Sea with their houses. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The United Nations stated on September 16 that the local death toll has exceeded 11,300, and another 10,100 people are still alive and dead. 40,000 people are homeless. There are still dead bodies soaked in the sea and no one has salvaged them. The number is bound to rise again. Libyan state-run media stated on the 17th that it is currently known that 891 buildings in Derna were completely destroyed, 211 buildings were partially destroyed, and 398 houses were soaked in mud after being flooded. The mayor&#39;s office speculated that the death toll could eventually reach 20,000 - equivalent to a fifth of the city&#39;s population. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the 17th, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs cited data from the World Health Organization and published a report, revising the death toll caused by the Libyan floods to 3,958, with more than 9,000 people missing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Derna is a city with a long history. &lt;/span>;) already exists. Amid the 2011 anti-government demonstrations in Libya, the city broke away from the control of Gaddafi&#39;s government on February 18. In 2014, the city was occupied by Islamic State militants, during which it was subjected to multiple air strikes by the Egyptian military. In 2015, the Derna Mujahideen Shura Council, a militia considered close to Al Qaeda, defeated the Islamic State and regained control of the city. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since then, General Khalifa Haftar, regarded as the main authority in eastern Libya, has led the siege of Derna, the last territory in eastern Libya that has resisted his rule, with intensive bombing and brutal The ground fighting inflicted heavy losses on the city. In 2018, Haftar finally captured Derna. Haftar did not order a large-scale reconstruction of Derna out of distrust of its residents. It was not until 2022 that the eastern Libyan government formulated a reconstruction plan for Derna. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Due to years of war, Derna City does not have unified central government management, its infrastructure is old, and its ability to prevent and control floods is very weak. In recent years, global warming has caused the waters of the Mediterranean to expand, and rising sea levels have eroded coastlines and caused flooding, especially in low-lying coastal areas like Derna. On September 10, 2023, Hurricane Daniel made landfall on the Mediterranean coast of eastern Libya. The hurricane had already caused serious damage in Greece, Turkey and Bulgaria along the Mediterranean coast, resulting in more than a dozen deaths. However, the Libyan authorities did not seriously formulate a monitoring plan. There was no plan to warn or evacuate residents of the dam situation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Libyan National Meteorological Center said it had issued warnings through emails and media 72 hours before &quot;Daniel&quot; made landfall, urging local governments to take preventive measures. However, the National Meteorological Center of Libya is affiliated to the Government of National Accord in the west, and Derna is an area controlled by the eastern government. Local residents said that they did not receive warning before the flood hit, and the authorities did not have any evacuation plan. They only heard the loud noise of the dam breaking. Only then did everyone realize that the flood was coming. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The World Meteorological Organization pointed out on September 14 that if the Libyan authorities had an early warning system for storms and floods, the vast majority of the victims could have been prevented from dying. In other words, this disaster appears to be a natural disaster, but is actually a man-made disaster. In the future, after floods wash away, landmines and unexploded bombs left over from years of war may surface, and secondary disasters may occur where people accidentally touch landmines. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the more than ten years since the fall of former Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi, Libya has experienced one war after another and political crisis after another. To this day, it is still in a situation of confrontation between the eastern and western governments. . Many people have long forgotten this long dispute, but the floods that occurred in Derna, causing tens of thousands of deaths and missing people, once again drew people&#39;s attention back to this ill-fated place. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/pviUluMz4LwOxQ6Ahu3w4waO28itNzjeEPzguqay.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;672&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/pviUluMz4LwOxQ6Ahu3w4waO28itNzjeEPzguqay.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251350&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On July 25, 2007, Tripoli, Libya, Libyan supreme leader Muammar Gaddafi (right) welcomed visiting French President Sarkozy&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa ;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;A divided country&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Libya has an area of ​​1.76 million square kilometers and a population of 6.7 million. It is located in northern Africa and the southern coast of the Mediterranean. To the east is Cyrenaica, to the west is Tripolitania, and to the southwest is Fezzan. There is a desert barrier between the three, making communication inconvenient. They have been separated for a long time in history. Due to the separation of the natural geographical environment, the eastern and western regions of Libya are closely connected with the surrounding Egypt, Tunisia and Algeria, but have little contact with each other. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Libya historically belonged to the Roman Empire, the Arab Empire and the Ottoman Turkish Empire, but these rulers regarded the above three regions as independent plates, so Libya has never been integrated into a unified entity in history. political community. Therefore, like most countries in the Middle East and North Africa, Libya is also a typical tribal country, and people identify with the tribe more than the country. During the period when it was ruled by the Arab Empire, it experienced the process of Islamization. Today, most people in Libya are Sunni believers in Islam. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the beginning of the 20th century, the unified Italy also joined the ranks of colonial expansion and began to look for its own territory in Africa. It took a fancy to Libya under the rule of the Ottoman Empire, so it brazenly launched a war of aggression. In 1912, Italy defeated the Ottoman Empire in the Italian-Turkish War, making Libya an Italian colony. At the same time, the Senussi Order in eastern Cyrenaica launched a large-scale resistance movement in the name of &quot;holy war&quot;. The secular forces in the western region also actively resisted Italian aggression and even established the Republic of Tripoli in 1918. It was later banned and disbanded by Mussolini. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the end of World War II, in July 1949, the leader of the Senussi Order, Idris, declared the independence of Cyrenaica and served as the emir. In December 1951, Idris won the support of nationalist forces and tribes in three regions and finally established the United Kingdom of Libya. The three regions of Cyrenaica, Tripolitania and Fezzan were each a state with autonomy. right. The three colors on the current Libyan flag represent these three federal states and are symbols of federalism. In 1963, Libya&#39;s new constitution abolished the federal system and divided the country into 10 provinces. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In September 1969, Gaddafi, the leader of the &quot;Free Officers Organization&quot;, launched a coup, overthrew the Idris dynasty and established the Libyan Arab Republic. Gaddafi, who was born in the Bedouin tribe of the Fezzan region, has ruled Libya for 42 years, relying mainly on strongman politics and centralization, coupled with distribution policies supported by oil revenue, to barely suppress tribalism and localism. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Libya first discovered oil in 1958 and officially started production in 1961. Its oil reserves are approximately 47.1 billion barrels, ranking first in Africa and ninth in the world, accounting for 2.9% of the world&#39;s total. Crude oil has good quality and low sulfur content. It is a high-quality oil and is very popular in the international market. After 1973, with the sharp rise in international oil prices, the Gaddafi regime gained a lot of wealth. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to avoid a recurrence of the tragedy of the fall of the Idris dynasty, and at the same time gain public support for his radical anti-imperialist stance, Gaddafi significantly increased investment in housing, health care, education and other fields, and increased workers&#39; wages. , and provide free public housing to the poor; the land originally belonging to the Senussi Order and Italian farmers will also be distributed to farmers, and farm tools and livestock will be provided at extremely low prices; new housing in rural areas can also be financed by government-controlled banks subsidy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But starting in the 1980s, due to the decline in international oil prices, Libyan oil revenue dropped sharply from US$21 billion in 1981 to US$5.4 billion in 1986. After the Lockerbie air crash in 1988, Libya was identified as the mastermind behind the crash and was subject to sanctions and embargoes by Western countries. In addition, oil field facilities are aging and oil production is ups and downs. There is no excess oil revenue to exchange for public support. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2010, 95% of Libya’s export revenue, 75% of government revenue, and 25% of GDP came from oil. At the same time, Libya’s domestic unemployment rate was as high as 30%, and most important infrastructure construction projects and crude oil extraction Projects are completed through international tenders and are completed by foreign companies and technical personnel, while a large number of Libya&#39;s own young labor force is unemployed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the end of 2010, the &quot;Arab Spring&quot; broke out in the Middle East, and Libya was also affected. Anti-government demonstrations occurred, and the government responded with force to suppress them. On February 27, 2011, the opposition established the &quot;National Transitional Council&quot; in Benghazi, Libya&#39;s second largest city. On March 19, Britain and France launched air strikes in Libya in accordance with United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973. On September 16, the United Nations General Assembly passed a resolution to replace Libya&#39;s seat in the United Nations by the National Transitional Council. On October 20, Gaddafi was killed on his way to escape. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On September 11, 2012, in protest against a movie that insulted Islam, the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi was attacked by an Islamic armed group. U.S. Ambassador Stevens was killed. The worst damage in years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/mzpx5TBpSLxfSfJJCWEvZMjsOtQwHjc2lgRNNRre.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;628&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/mzpx5TBpSLxfSfJJCWEvZMjsOtQwHjc2lgRNNRre.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251352&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;September 16, 2023, the disaster-stricken area of ​​Derna, Libya&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Xinhua News Agency/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Post-Gaddafi era&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The Libyan opposition is a group that includes defectors from the original Gaddafi regime, pro-Western liberals, eastern tribal leaders who are dissatisfied with Gaddafi and the dictatorship of western tribes, former Id A hodgepodge of supporters of the Reese royal family, the only thing they have in common is their dissatisfaction with Gaddafi. When the revolution has not yet succeeded, because the common enemy is still there, everyone has to seek common ground while reserving differences and work hard to cooperate. However, when the overall situation is determined, interests emerge, and the struggle for power is inevitable. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To avoid infighting and division when sharing the fruits of the revolution, a leader with high moral integrity and the ability to reconcile various factions is necessary. However, during the 42 years of Gaddafi&#39;s rule, Libya had no president, no prime minister, no parliament, no cabinet, only Colonel Gaddafi. The imagination and passion of a generation were limited by the ubiquitous &quot;Green Book&quot;. How could it be possible? Such a politician appeared in a short period of time? In addition, after Gaddafi&#39;s army was disbanded, Libya failed to form a new national army. The existing militia groups strengthened their own forces and expanded their territory, causing the country to fall into a state of disorder. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During Gaddafi’s rule, Cyrenaica in the east was suppressed by him for a long time, and the locals were always very dissatisfied. After the &quot;Arab Spring&quot; took place, this was the first place where trouble broke out and started anew. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Libya was divided: the Government of National Accord and its armed forces recognized by the United Nations controlled most of western Libya, while the &quot;National Army&quot; led by Haftar controlled eastern and western Libya. Central Region. The two sides have clashed several times since 2014, and Libya has descended into civil war. The civil war continued until 2020, and the two sides finally reached a ceasefire. However, until now, the general election originally scheduled for 2021 has not been held, and sporadic fighting between the western armed forces and the eastern armed forces continues. Just last month, at least 45 people were killed in fighting between the two sides in Tripoli. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;An important reason why the situation in Libya cannot be stabilized is the intervention of external forces. The Western Government of National Accord recognized by the United Nations has Turkey, Qatar and Italy as its backers, as well as Egypt, Russia, Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, and France. It supports the Haftar regime that controls the center and east. Italy wants to maintain the &quot;face&quot; of its former colonial master, Turkey wants to restore the glory of the &quot;Ottoman Empire&quot;... Each &quot;player&quot; has different reasons for entering the game. However, they seem to have the same goal behind them, which is the oil and natural gas resources in the Eastern Mediterranean. In the past ten years, a large amount of natural gas and oil have been discovered in this sea area. Libya and even the entire Eastern Mediterranean region have once again become a &quot;powder keg&quot; for various countries to engage in energy competition. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The consequences of disorder in Libya are not limited to the current out-of-control floods. After the fall of Gaddafi, the rebels looted the weapons arsenal of the government forces, and many weapons were transferred to other surrounding countries, especially extremist organizations. Chadian President Deby believes that the rise of extremist organizations such as the Nigerian terrorist organization &quot;Boko Haram&quot; , has a great relationship with the situation in Libya. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 23 Sep 2023 20:25:03 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
