According to his wife Liu Xiazhen, Zhulian is 10 years old and Fulian is 8 years old. According to his wife Pan Huiying, Shulian is 4 years old, Duansheng is 2 years old and Yongning is less than one year old. Cai E neglected his personal interests and became depressed after his death. His last words &quot;didn&#39;t say anything about family affairs&quot;, leaving him no time to consider the upbringing and education of his children after his death. Fortunately, teachers and friends such as Liang Qichao, Tan Yankai, and Xiong Xiling planned the orphan education on their behalf. The friendship was touching, but the process was quite tortuous. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/09/XSS8hEUs7F0U5LvWNclWRSn5I5prgY7gCQIsCVK7.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;758&quot; height= &quot;629&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/09/XSS8hEUs7F0U5LvWNclWRSn5I5prgY7gCQIsCVK7.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253483&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Cai E&#39;s family portrait published in &quot;Oriental Magazine&quot;. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Cai Gong Orphan Education Association&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In early February 1917, the Hunan Provincial Government Approved the establishment of the Cai Gong Orphans Education Association, and announced the association&#39;s seven rules and staff list:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;This association will be the foundation for planning. It is his duty to manage the upbringing of Cai Gong&#39;s orphans. (2) The association publicly recommends a number of reviewers to perform the following duties: planning orphan education policies; raising, keeping and distributing orphan education fees; and appointing directors. (3) The Association presumes that the following directors are entrusted by all members to perform their duties: Education Director, who is responsible for supervising the implementation of orphan education, reviewing subjects, selecting schools, inspecting academic performance, etc.; Accounting Director in Hunan, Responsible for the safekeeping of education fees in Hunan; Accounting Director in Shanghai, responsible for the custody of education fees in Shanghai. (4) Each director must report the performance of his duties to the reviewers once every six months. If there are any obstacles in the progress, all reviewers will be asked to solve the problem. (5) The comments of the reviewers shall be made by correspondence. (6) Any director who resigns will be reviewed and re-recommended by all the reviewers. (7) Once the orphan reaches adulthood, the association shall be revoked by unanimous resolution of the council members. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Reviewers: Liang Qichao, Xiong Xiling, Tan Yankai, Fan Yuanlian, Jiang Fangzhen, Zhang Xiaozhun, Shi Taojun, Zeng Jiwu, Fan Zhihuan . &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liang Qichao was the founder of Cai Gong’s Orphans Education Association. The month after Cai E’s death, he drafted the rules of the association and sought the consent of relevant personnel. Shi Taojun submitted the case to the nearby Hunan Provincial Government. Liang Qichao drafted a speech that was full of reasoning and reasoning: &quot;Therefore, the general served as an official in Yunnan and Guangxi, and served in Kyoto for more than ten years. At times, he was worried about state affairs, and did not care about family finances. In the breeze, his sleeves were full of energy, and he engraved this The white hair is in the hall, the yellow mouth is in the arms, and all the aftermath matters are waiting to be dealt with. Maybe they have been in trouble all the time, or they may have been close friends. They are saddened by the death of the hero, and the orphans are helpless. They gather their colleagues and organize the Cai Gong Orphans Education Association. . Regarding matters related to the upbringing of orphans, our Association should carefully plan and cooperate with us at all times to provide support for the future. We should ensure that we are able to serve the country well in the future, have no worries at home, and comfort the souls of heroes underground.&quot; The Hunan Provincial Government has already participated in the matter. Chief Tan Yankai immediately gave instructions for filing, and ordered Xiangjiang Daoyin and the governors of Changsha and Baoqing counties to check and take the records. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/09/KhSZoB5bYYKmJgoXQpy6K3S6p68uWuMO6VwV12Zj.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height= &quot;800&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/09/KhSZoB5bYYKmJgoXQpy6K3S6p68uWuMO6VwV12Zj.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253482&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Records about the Cai E Orphans Education Association in &quot;Tan Yankai&#39;s Diary&quot;. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liang Qichao put a lot of thought into the design of the Cai Gong Orphans Education Association. Its goals and tasks, division of responsibilities and operation methods are all clear and feasible. As early as early December 1916, Xiong Xiling proposed: &quot;The current situation is unpredictable. To raise money for Song Gong&#39;s bereaved family, it seems appropriate to quickly send calls to the central government and all provinces for help.&quot; He also asked Liang Qichao to lead the call. Through contact with Cai E&#39;s family in Shanghai, Liang Qichao discovered that &quot;their family affairs were extremely controversial,&quot; so he decided to initiate the establishment of the Cai E&#39;s Orphans Education Association to reduce the impact of family conflicts on the education of orphans. Instead of using electricity to raise donations, so as not to violate Cai E&#39;s &quot;honest intentions during his lifetime,&quot; he instead mobilized relatives and friends to donate money, and planned to subsidize it with royalties. The people invited were selected by Liang Qichao, and were either Cai E&#39;s mentors or colleagues from the same hometown. Xiong Xiling, Tan Yankai, Fan Yuanlian, Zhao Hengti, and Jiang Fangzhen were also important figures who influenced Hunan Province and even the country. There are separate accounting directors in Hunan and Shanghai. One is to facilitate current education, and the other is to facilitate future study abroad, taking long-term and comprehensive considerations into account. In addition, two sources of fundraising are planned: one is national pension, and the other is sponsorship by comrades and martyrs at home and abroad; three methods of maintaining and increasing the value of donations: one is to purchase real estate, the other is to invest in valuable public stocks, and the third is to save in banks . Liang Qichao&#39;s design was unanimously approved by Tan Yankai, Xiong Xiling and others, who believed that it was &quot;allowed to be called Xiexie&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On April 17, 1917, Tan Yankai came to the Cai Gongying Funeral Office located in the Changsha Army Surveying and Mapping Bureau to attend a meeting of the Cai Gong Orphans Education Association. This is the first actual operation of the Cai Gong Orphans Education Association. Zhang Xiaozhun, Shi Taojun, Zeng Jiwu, Fan Zhihuan, Xiao Kun, Yuan Jiapu, Zhao Hengti, Liu Gengxian, Chen Fuchu, He Pengxiang, Tang Xi, Yue Sen, etc. in Hunan have a high probability of joining the Cai E family. Attended a meeting together. After the meeting, Tan Yankai telegraphed the agreed opinions of the meeting to Xiong Xiling and solicited his opinions:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Xiao Ri (Editor&#39;s note: on the 17th) The Cai Gong Orphans Educational Association held a meeting and decided on the following matters: 1. The property in Shanmen shall be retained by the Dowager. 2. The newly purchased houses and land in the provincial capital and Baoqing City are owned by brothers Duansheng (i.e. Cai Duan, author&#39;s note). 3. The new and old movable properties, except for the 10,000 yuan provided for the meal expenses of the dowager, the rest of the stocks and cash will belong to the Duansheng brothers. 4. According to Cai Gong’s order during his lifetime, Duansheng will be raised by his wife, and Yongning will be raised by his wife. All movable and immovable properties will be equally divided and cannot be sold. 5. Investigate old accounts and clear them separately. 6. Madam, if your wife is currently living together and separated, should you do that?&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The distribution plan is centered on brothers Cai Duan and Cai Yongning, which has the color of the era where men are superior to women. Shanmen&#39;s local property is located in Shanmen Town, Wugang County (now part of Dongkou County) where the Cai family lived. It consists of a field with an annual rent of ten stones and an old house. Two new real estate properties were purchased in the provincial capital and Baoqing City. One is the residence at No. 1 Zhangshu Garden, Swan Pond, outside the south gate of Changsha City, which is relatively small in scale; the other is the abandoned site of the old association in Baoqing City, which was built by Cai E after his death. Tang Qian came forward to purchase it and originally planned to build a nursing home for Cai&#39;s mother, but the construction had not yet started due to lack of funds. The bulk of the property was the shares of Hunan Huachang Mining Company, which were very popular at the time, totaling 34,000 yuan, of which 5,000 yuan was purchased by Liang Huankui three years ago as a gift in gratitude to Cai E for his hard work and lack of production. At that time, the monthly salary of the brigade commander was as high as 2,000 silver dollars, and the total property of the Cai family did not exceed 40,000 yuan. Compared with local officials of the same era, they were really shabby. The sixth article, &quot;Mrs. Ru, Mrs. Ru is currently living together and separated&quot; confirms that &quot;their family affairs are extremely controversial&quot;, which obviously puts Tan Yankai in a bit of trouble. This telegram is found in &quot;Mr. Xiong Xiling&#39;s Posthumous Manuscript&quot; and should have been sent to Liang Qichao and others at the same time, but others have not preserved it. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Pay attention to descendants to repay the old friends&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;After the victory of the National Defense Movement, wars still continued, social unrest and people&#39;s livelihood were difficult, and the Cai family was also greatly affected. Affected by the international situation and other factors, the price of pure antimony dropped sharply. After a short period of prosperity, Hunan Huachang Mining Company fell into trouble in 1918 and later went bankrupt. Company managers such as Yang Du and Xiong Xiling have also been subject to continued lawsuits and extortion by Americans, and have even been detained. The Cai family&#39;s important asset, 34,000 yuan worth of shares in Hunan Huachang Mining Company, was lost in less than two years after collecting interest. Affected by war and disasters, the Cai family almost lost revenue from land and house rent. The world is difficult, and colleagues in the association have suffered greatly, but they still take the responsibility of caring for and supporting Cai E&#39;s orphan at heart. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On February 19, 1921, Tan Yankai, who was in the Guangdong military government, wrote to Shi Taojun: &quot;We must not ignore Mr. Cai&#39;s orphan. There are too few people here, and I am afraid that the inquiry is not as good as ours. My brother calls me my generation. It would be good to work out a solution, and everyone will agree. I hope you will tell me what you think.&quot; This was Tan Yankai&#39;s reply to Shi Taojun. Facing the plight of the Cai family&#39;s financial resources drying up, Shi Taojun asked Tan Yankai to find a way to rescue him, hoping to find a way to rescue him in Guangdong. Although Tan Yankai could not think of a permanent solution to the new approach, his sense of responsibility and concern were palpable. Four years later, Shi Taojun&#39;s son Shi Chaobai and Cai Zhulian got married in Shanghai, and then studied in Japan together, which was also an apology to their hometown friends. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/09/jaiAoaID918ardyBcujrPDHc5gbSfoHa1PqKJQzR.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;772&quot; height= &quot;441&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/09/jaiAoaID918ardyBcujrPDHc5gbSfoHa1PqKJQzR.png&quot; data-key=&quot;253484&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The &quot;News&quot; report on Cai E&#39;s Orphans Correctional Association on February 17, 1917. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the end of May 1922, Liang Qichao called Zhao Hengti, the governor of the Hunan Provincial Government, asking him to care for Cai E&#39;s orphan and protect the Cai family&#39;s property. The text is as follows: &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Dear Sir, Qi Chao met with Bingsan and Jingsheng a few days ago, and occasionally asked about Cai’s posthumous affairs and education. The problem is that we should pay special attention to the incident. As for the property purchased by the bereaved family, since it is the capital of Cai Gong, we have to think of some preventive methods. The savings of the Cai Gong Orphans Correctional Association are very small, so they can only set aside funds for education, and it is extremely difficult to use them for other purposes. The living problems of the surviving family members cannot but focus on the property that has been established. Unless there is an official effort to consolidate the preservation of this property, it is difficult to guarantee that it will not be eroded or abused by local ruffians. Members of the association should fulfill their own responsibility for maintaining and supervising the association, so those who respect the descendants of meritorious deeds are repaying their deceased friends. I hereby write to the deacon to promptly issue a notice and order it to be handed over to the local government office where Cai Gong’s property is located, prohibiting the sale and mortgage of the property, so as to protect the property and its long-term prosperity. The words of public friendship are dedicated to this, and I praise Xun&#39;an. Liang Qichao also started. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhao Hengti was once convicted of rebelling against Yuan, but was rescued by Cai E. He was very grateful. He was also a member of the Cai Gong Orphans Correctional Association, and immediately ordered the governor of Baoqing, where the Cai family was from, to comply. Zhang Xiaoyu, let everyone know. It can also be seen that Liang Qichao, Xiong Xiling, Fan Yuanlian and others have never forgotten Cai E and the orphans of the Cai family, and often tried hard to protect them. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In early 1927, with the development of the Northern Expedition and popular movements, Hunan Province&#39;s movement to recover concessions, regain consular jurisdiction, anti-warlords, and punish old bureaucrats and gentry gained unprecedented momentum. The provincial government successively promulgated the &quot;Hunan Province Provisional Provisions on Punishing Local Bullies and Evil Gentlemen&quot; Regulations&quot; and the &quot;Interim Regulations of Hunan Province on Punishing Corrupt Officials&quot;, a special court and a committee to investigate and investigate counterfeit goods were established, and the campaign of sealing and confiscating counterfeit goods spread throughout the province. The Provincial Inspection and Inspection Office will reward those who report illegal property. The reward for reporting movable property will be 20% of the confiscated amount, and the reward for reporting immovable property will be 5% of the confiscated amount. Groups such as the Provincial Federation of Trade Unions have actively promoted it, using members&#39; meetings and other means to distribute questionnaires on adverse labor on a large scale, and strongly encourage reporting of adverse labor. There is a sizable property under Tang Guo&#39;s name, located at No. 31, Dadongmao Lane, Changsha City. It has been declared a reverse production and is about to be confiscated as the office building of the Provincial Mining Union. Three days later, the Cai Duan brothers contacted all walks of life to the effect that although the property was built by the Tang family, all rights had been transferred to the Cai family and should be returned. Immediately, under the intervention of military dignitary Tang Shengzhi and others, the property was removed from the list of adverse births. Tang Qian (1875-1929), courtesy name, was born in Baoqing. He joined the Tongmenghui while studying in Japan. After returning to China in 1905, he successively served as the director of the Guangxi Army Academy and the Yunnan Lecture Hall. Later, he participated in the Revolution of 1911 and the National Defense Movement. He has always been with Cai E and regarded him as a brother. He was one of the attachés who escorted Cai E to Japan for medical treatment. After that, Tang Xi served as the Financial Secretary of the Hunan Provincial Government, the President of the Provincial State Council, and the Director of the Provincial Finance Bureau. He was an important member of the provincial governor Zhao Hengti, and also served as the Director of the Ministry of Finance of the Beiyang Government. The warlord Zhao Hengti and the Beiyang government were both wanted to overthrow the Hunan Province at that time. Because of this relationship, the industries under Tang Guan&#39;s name were included in the anti-production list. Two years later, Tang Guan died in Shanghai, and his family donated the property to the Renshu Hospital next door in accordance with his last wish. It can be seen that the Cai Duan brothers provided friendly assistance to the Tang family by providing electricity, and it was society&#39;s respect for Cai E&#39;s orphan that preserved the Tang family&#39;s property. Before and after this, Cai E&#39;s second brother, Song Yuan, privately used his property as a mortgage to borrow money and deliberately went into bad debts. Cai E&#39;s wife, Liu Xiazhen, came forward to report that he had been defrauded and reported the case to the police station. It was immediately exposed by the other party and a public statement was made in the newspaper. However, it was only published for three days and then stopped. There was also the intervention of important people behind the scenes to protect Cai E&#39;s family. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past ten years, Liang Qichao has expanded his influence by advocating state funerals, regular commemorations, organizing Songpa Library, and writing birthday poems for Cai E&#39;s mother to take care of Cai E&#39;s orphan, who was still at home one or two years before his death. The book mentions: &quot;Cai Songpo&#39;s family is hungry and now they are homeless in Shanghai.&quot; Naturally, they can&#39;t help but try to save them. When Jiang Fangzhen was in Changsha, he lived in Cai E&#39;s house. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past ten years, Zhang Xiaozhun, Fan Yuanlian, Liang Qichao, Tang Xiang, and Tan Yankai have passed away one after another, but colleagues in the Cai Gong Orphans Correctional Association and even outsiders have never given up helping Cai E&#39;s orphans. The friendship is touching. In June 1931, upon the petition of Zhang Renjie and others, the National Government allocated an annual pension of 800 yuan to Cai E&#39;s survivors, a monthly education fee of 400 yuan for their children, and a subsidy of 5,000 yuan for building a temple. Cai E&#39;s daughter was mentally depressed and was recuperating in Mogan Mountain, so Jiu Buqu heard the news and donated money to help reduce the pressure on medical expenses. On May 2, 1935, Mrs. Cai&#39;s mother Wang passed away in Changsha. Dignitaries from all walks of life sent letters of condolences and presented expensive gifts. The Hunan provincial government organized a grand funeral. The reputation of the Cai family reached its highest level after Cai E&#39;s state funeral. point. Around 1950, under the arrangement of Zhu De, Cai Duan and Cai Yongning entered the North China People&#39;s Revolutionary University to study, and were subsequently assigned jobs. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;A little regret and accident&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;There are very few public historical materials about Cai E&#39;s orphan&#39;s growth and development. According to general reports, except for Cai Fulian, who died young, both men and two women were college graduates. Cai Duan studied in the History Department of Fu Jen Catholic University in Peking, Cai Yongning studied in the History Department of Southwest Associated University, Cai Shulian studied in the Department of Pests and Diseases of Zhejiang University, and Cai Zhulian also studied abroad Japan. According to the &quot;History of Peking Fu Jen Catholic University&quot;, Cai Duan entered the History Department of Peking Fu Jen Catholic University in 1934. In 1935, he participated in the December 9 and December 16 anti-Japanese demonstrations and was injured, which shows that he was quite heroic as a young man. Peking Fu Jen Catholic University is a church-run university with excellent teachers and equipment. However, the tuition is expensive, about 400 yuan per academic year, and ordinary families cannot afford it. The care and concern of the Cai E Orphans Correctional Association and the righteous people have ensured that the living and educational standards of the four people are higher than ordinary people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After graduation, Cai Duan worked in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the National Government. After the founding of New China, he worked in the Cultural and Historical Materials Research Committee of the National Committee of the Chinese People&#39;s Political Consultative Conference and Guangming Daily. Cai Yongning worked in Yunnan Fudian Bank and Beijing Institute of Physical Education. Cai Shulian teaches at Songpo Middle School in Kunming, Yunnan. All four of them received good higher education and obtained decent jobs after entering the society. It can be said that they have basically become adults. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the second half of 1946, General Lei Biao, a fellow countryman of Cai E&#39;s hometown, published a long article &quot;A Brief Story of Mr. Cai Songpo&quot; in the &quot;National Defense Monthly&quot;, recalling Cai E&#39;s achievements and character in detail with deep affection, and even sighed at the end of the article. Angry:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;However, the family situation after his death is also deeply sighing. As a general, The family has no place to stand, the old mother is in the house, the two younger brothers have not completed their studies, the widow has a young son, and the upbringing is helpless. Although Liang was appointed as a public teacher, he collected 10,000 to 20,000 gold from various parties&#39; tributes, just for the temporary needs of the family, and as a citizen. In the 90s and 10s, the war between the north and the south resumed, and Baoqing, where he was originally from, was particularly affected. His mother, wife, concubines, and children had no peace at home all year round, and they had no choice but to live in Yunnan, Beijing, etc., and all their savings were exhausted. , it is also very surprising that the most shameful ones are the ones who have benefited the most, and those who have taken charge of the donations collected by all parties to support orphans, no less than tens of thousands of yuan, have been swallowed up together. Unexpectedly, in the army protecting the country, there are actually like this Such a person. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the first half of 1905, Cai E served as the assistant director of the Hunan Coaching Office and a teacher at the Hunan Military Preparation School and the Bingmu School. Lei Biao was a student at the Bingmu School and followed Cai E after graduating in June of that year. E went to Guangxi, then to Yunnan and Sichuan, participated in the Revolution of 1911 and the National Defense Movement, and has been holding important military positions. When Cai E left Sichuan, he told Lei Biao to control an army and support the provincial governor Dai Kan. Because he was far away in Sichuan and probably not familiar with Liang Qichao, he did not participate in the Cai E Orphans Education Association. As a fellow villager, student, and subordinate of Cai E, what Lei Biao said should be basically credible based on his identity and experience. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many colleagues from Cai E’s Orphans Correctional Association have joined the National Defense Army. Among them, Shi Taojun, Zeng Jiwu, Xiao Kun, Liu Gengxian, He Pengxiang, Tang Guan, and Yue Sen are Baoqing compatriots who have more contacts with Cai E. He Pengxiang and Tang Gu were Cai E&#39;s deputy chief and secretary respectively. Theoretically, these people could be the person Lei Biao mentioned. As for people outside the association, it&#39;s hard to guess. However, people at the time generally believed that Shi Taojun and Cai E had a long and frequent relationship, and later became in-laws of their children, with the two families having the closest relationship. Li Xiaodan&#39;s &quot;Farewell Biography of Cai E&quot; pointed out: &quot;His classmate Shi Taojun was the broker of his family affairs.&quot; Therefore, it is very possible that Lei Biao alluded to Shi Taojun. Of course, all this is just speculation, and the truth needs to be proven by new historical data. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is a great pity that such a collective act of charity is mixed with the selfish misdeeds of individuals. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 10 Oct 2023 10:25:13 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[最高人民检察院依法对杜兆才决定逮捕]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258323]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-10 10:10:11&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;span>;The case of Du Zhaocai, a former member of the Party Leadership Group and Deputy Director of the State Sports General Administration, is suspected of accepting bribes and will be investigated by the National Supervisory Commission The case is concluded and transferred to the procuratorate for review and prosecution.

When I signed up, I saw that it was full of people; when I went to the classroom, I saw that it was full of people. It&#39;s crowded. There were originally 40 people per class, but now it&#39;s almost 60. But what troubled my wife and me at first was whether the child should write with his left hand or with his right hand. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;My son is left-handed, which is a minority. According to statistics, one in ten people is left-handed. There are many left-handers in our family. My mother, wife, and eldest daughter are all left-handed. According to this statistics, the majority of them reaches 60%. When my son followed me to write calligraphy and draw pictures, many people around me were surprised and said: &quot;Left hand!&quot; My wife and I are relatively consistent on this point and have never let him forcefully use his right hand. Therefore, when others are surprised, I will say to my son: Son, you can write in whichever hand you want. Dad will not force you. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;My son is very casual when he learns to write from me. But when I entered first grade, the problem of writing first surfaced again, as if it was back to when my eldest daughter was more than ten years ago. Because my daughter’s left hand writing was forcibly changed by her elementary school teacher, but she was not used to it at first, and then she changed to writing with her right hand. The left hand still took priority in doing other things, but the left hand could no longer write. Looking back on my daughter&#39;s experience of changing her right hand to write, the only difference is that when writing numbers and letters, there is a mirror image. Sometimes it is easy to make mistakes like b and d, but she gradually got used to it. For my son, I talked with the kindergarten teacher when he first started drawing with colored pens, and he has always used his left hand. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Because of the problem of left and right hands, I have checked a lot of information, but there are almost no accurate and scientifically verified answers. Is this a question to be studied or a pseudo-question that is not a question? It is worth thinking about. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After searching on the Internet, many celebrities including Einstein and Bill Gates are left-handed. They are far away from us. The most famous one I know is Gao Fenghan, a Qing Dynasty painter and one of the Eight Eccentrics of Jiangnan. He has hundreds of square meters of exhibition area dedicated to his works in the Qingdao Museum. He is a famous writer who writes with his left hand, but I don&#39;t know if he is left-handed because he only used his left hand after his right hand became ill. The other is the local Nobel Prize winner Mo Yan. I often see him writing with his left hand, but I don’t know if he is left-handed, let alone whether his most famous works were inspired by his left hand or his right hand. Assuming that both of them are right-handed, there will be no problem writing with the right hand, and the left-handed person will naturally use the left hand. Of course, there will be no problem. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We live in a world where the right hand is used to writing, eating and doing things. Because the number of people is small, people are a little curious about people who do things with the left hand. From this perspective, the question of writing with the left hand or with the right hand is a social phenomenon, an indicator of social tolerance. When you are a minority, the only problem may be that you have to grow up in a different light, which is not easy. Although it is not easy, I still tend to let it take its course when it comes to my son&#39;s left hand writing. With a symmetrical human body structure, it is impossible to say which side has the advantage. Therefore, it is especially important to treat left-handers as normally and naturally as right-handers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I used to think that this issue would attract many parents to discuss it enthusiastically, but when I posted it in the class group, I got no response. After the first parent-teacher meeting in elementary school, I communicated with my child’s class teacher, and the answer I got surprised me: In my son’s class, among the 55 children, there was only one left-handed person who wrote. Of course, he was not the only one who was left-handed. I asked friends of all ages who are familiar with me, and the information I got was: a fourth-grade primary school student said that there was only one student in his class who wrote with his left hand; a second-grade primary school student said that there was no one in his class who wrote with his left hand; a third-grade primary school student said The head teacher told me that in her impression, among the many classes she taught, there was only one child who wrote with his left hand. It seems that the question of whether we use our left hand or our right hand has been entangled for a long time. For most people, it is not a problem at all, and of course there is no need to discuss it. Perhaps, parents had made a choice about this issue when they first started holding pens in kindergarten, or they may have struggled with it at that time, but most people chose the mainstream, that is, using their right hand. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Children who are born left-handed are destined to be a minority among the crowd, and it seems that children who choose to write with their left hand can only be a minority among the minority in our small place. If you look at it from another angle, writing naturally with the hand that is most convenient for you is not a problem if you are left-handed and right-handed. But from the perspective of only looking at the left and right, especially the perspective that more people only look at the right hand, becoming a minority is indeed a challenge. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If a son chooses to write with his right hand, it will be a challenge. It will challenge his physical limits. This is an individual issue; but choosing the left hand and choosing the minority is a psychological and social challenge. Children, although you are in the minority, hold on! &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(The author is a citizen of Gaomi, Shandong)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;• &lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;(The &quot;hi, Southern Weekly&quot; column of Southern Weekend App is looking forward to your contributions.

One day, I received a call from the village cadre saying that several trees next to his own grain drying field outside the village needed to be cut down. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These are some poplar trees that my father planted next to the grain drying farm more than ten years ago. Although they were planted at the same time, several trees grew unevenly. The largest one was more than 30 centimeters in diameter at breast height and I couldn&#39;t wrap my arms around it, while the smallest one was no more than the width of a bowl. My mother said that maybe they were planted too densely, and the weaker ones couldn&#39;t compete with the stronger ones, so they grew slower and slower. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After chatting with the village cadres for a while, I learned that cutting down trees was required by the superiors. This time, in addition to a few trees in my house, all the trees planted by villagers in nearby fields will be cut down: &quot;This time, all these trees in the fields south of the road must be cut down, and there is no bargaining.&quot; It is said that the County Land and Resources Bureau received satellite photos (&quot;satellite photos&quot;) sent by superiors, which circled many places in our county and said that these are cultivated lands, and those with trees must be cut down, and those with greenhouses must be demolished. All the land was restored to cultivated land. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ordinarily, our trees grow beside the grain drying field and are not planted in the ground. Strictly speaking, the grain drying farm is agricultural facility land, not farmland. How did this small grain drying field with only a few dozen square meters turn into cultivated land? Maybe it’s because my parents have been in poor health in recent years and have farmed a lot less land. This drying field has basically not been used. It is covered with grass in summer, so it is regarded as cultivated land in the satellite film? Or maybe those who watched the satellite films didn&#39;t make a careful distinction at all, but just drew a random picture and concluded that all the land south of a certain road was cultivated land, and if it was changed to other uses, it would be restored? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, such problems are not uncommon in the process of &quot;satellite film law enforcement&quot;. More than half a month ago, a doctoral student from the School of Social Sciences of Wuhan University also mentioned a similar issue in an article. The superior land and resources department determines land use based on the changes in the &quot;patterns&quot; of satellite photos over the past few years. If it is found that the original cultivated land has turned into forests or houses have been built, it will issue a notice asking the local government to &quot;enforce the law&quot; and return the land to farming. But the problem is that the use of some land is more complicated and has changed many times in history. Just looking at satellite images without carefully studying the nature of the land and its changes can easily lead to problems. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;And due to the insufficient resolution of the satellite images used in land surveys in previous years, some relatively small roads and other construction lands were not identified and were all classified as cultivated land. Nowadays, with technology upgrades, satellite photos The resolution has been greatly improved, and the road in the middle of the farmland could be distinguished. However, it turned out that it was considered illegal to occupy land for road construction and needed to be rectified. Just like my family&#39;s grain-drying field, it was also zoned as cultivated land, and the trees planted next to it had to be cut down. These mechanical &quot;law enforcement&quot; that do not study the actual situation and only look at pictures on satellite films, the pressure is directly transmitted to the grassroots, and conflicts between cadres and farmers are commonplace. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In our county, due to the reduction of rural population and lack of labor force, a lot of land cannot be cultivated. Moreover, most of the land in our village is hilly and sloping, and it is difficult to divert water for irrigation. We basically rely on the sky for food, and the harvest from farming is not high. For farmers, switching to planting trees may not bring much income from selling trees, but at least they don’t have to work hard every year. A few years ago, the government also encouraged afforestation and even provided subsidies for planting trees, so some villages also planted trees on their farmland. Nowadays, it is necessary to &quot;return forests to farmland&quot; and cut down all the trees that are just about to become useful. This will naturally harm the interests of farmers and cause many people to not understand. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, there are indeed some good lands, and it is a pity to plant trees. For example, the neighboring village has thousands of acres of flat land beside a small river. There is water in the river. It was the &quot;irrigated land&quot; that everyone envied back then, and it was very suitable for growing wheat and corn. Later, these lands were also planted with trees. When I passed by my hometown a few years ago, I felt quite emotional. These patches of cultivated land have good soil quality and water for irrigating, and large agricultural machinery can be used to reduce manpower. Perhaps after the cultivated land is restored, it can be collectively contracted to large households for growing food through circulation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for the barren mountainous land in our village, even if it is converted back to cultivated land, there will be no one in the village who can cultivate it. After all, the more than 200 people who still stay in the village all year round are mostly six-year-olds. For a seventy-year-old man, these fragmented lands are difficult to carry out large-scale mechanized farming. Even if all the trees are cut down, the final result is likely to be abandoned. So what’s the point of cutting down trees and “still plowing”? Will we spend money to hire people to grow food in the future? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, although there are doubts, the old people in the village are relatively honest, and most of them will not delve into it. If it says it needs to be cut, then just do it. After all, cutting down trees is now the task of the village cadres, and many of the villagers are related to the village cadres, or at least they are neighbors who never see each other without looking up. The villagers do not want to make it too difficult for them. It&#39;s not worth breaking up for a few trees. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to the village cadres, there were also two businessmen from nearby villages who specialized in cutting down and buying trees. They negotiated the price on the spot, and they would come to cut down the trees and take them away the next day. There was no need to sell the trees in the whole process. People worry. However, since trees are being cut down everywhere now, the price is naturally much cheaper. A few years ago, someone offered 200 yuan to buy the largest tree, but my mother thought the price was too low and refused to sell it. Now, the five trees can only be sold for 200 yuan in total. This was because the person who bought the tree was an acquaintance from my mother’s natal village and was given a preferential price. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 10 Oct 2023 08:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[女子称学信网显示“结业”错失高薪工作：学历问题事关诚信，理应严肃以待丨快评]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258303]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-09 23:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Recently, an &quot;academic qualification news&quot; has attracted attention. According to the &quot;Yangtze Evening News&quot; report, Ms. Lu from Shanghai reported that Hunan Normal University issued her a graduation certificate and degree certificate when she graduated as an undergraduate, but the Xuexin website showed that she had graduated, which led to the company she was applying for doubting when she changed jobs. He made false claims and failed to pass the review, missing out on a job opportunity with a monthly salary of more than 40,000 yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ms. Lu said that the school refused to change back to graduation status because her Mandarin scores were unsatisfactory at that time. &quot;But when she graduated in 2002, the major did not have this requirement at all.&quot; In June 2023, Ms. Lu will Hunan Normal University went to court and asked the school to change its Xuexin.com status to graduated. On October 6, the school refused to mediate before trial. The Changsha Railway Transport Court determined that Ms. Lu graduated in 2002, which exceeded the maximum prosecution period for administrative litigation, and dismissed the lawsuit. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The matter has evolved to this point, and public opinion is mostly on the side of the woman involved. A closer look at this incident reveals that there are still many details that need to be analyzed one by one before a correct conclusion can be drawn. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First of all, judging from the time when this case is presented, there are still many factual issues that need to be determined. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The main reason for the prosecution and defense of the woman involved is that she received the graduation certificate and degree certificate issued by the school, and she graduated early; the school should not use the &quot;Putonghua test failed to meet the standard&quot; as an excuse to use the Xuexin.com The status was changed from &quot;graduated&quot; to &quot;completed&quot; because she was not a teacher major and should not have this graduation requirement; the court&#39;s determination of the prosecution period should be adjusted to start when she &quot;learned of the prosecution period&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The issue of &quot;early graduation&quot; and the woman involved&#39;s two certificates are the basic facts that need to be clarified urgently in this case. As we all know, those who are eligible to apply for early graduation must have completed all courses with excellent results within three years, completed the defense of their graduation thesis, and must also meet other graduation requirements. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Judging from the graduation certificate and degree certificate published in media reports, the woman in question did indeed obtain these two paper certificates issued in June 2002. So, did the woman in question, who enrolled in school in 1999, &quot;leave school on her own initiative&quot; or &quot;graduate early&quot; in 2002? Does the non-teaching major she majored in when she left school have a Mandarin test as a graduation requirement? What procedural problems occurred between the time the woman in question obtained the two certificates and the time when the school uploaded the status to the Xuexin.com as &quot;graduated&quot;? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Judging from the school’s defense reasons, the school gave two explanations. First, the woman’s Mandarin test scores were not up to standard, so she could only upload “graduation” on the Xuexin website; The two certificates in the woman&#39;s hands &quot;were found to be not issued by the school in accordance with procedures,&quot; and there were procedural issues. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There may be two possibilities: one is that the woman in question had no problem in obtaining the two certificates, but the school refused to upload the correct information to the Xuexin website; the other is that the two certificates in the hands of the woman in question were There is a problem with the certificate. If the application is issued in violation of regulations or is issued incorrectly, the school will only &quot;come to its senses&quot; after the fact, so it can only correct it when uploading information to Xuexin.com. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Therefore, the school needs to respond to the following questions: Since graduation certificates and degree certificates were not issued in accordance with procedures, who was responsible for issuing the certificates at that time? What means did the woman in question use to obtain two illegal certificates? Afterwards, since the school realized that the two certificates were not in compliance with the procedures, why did it not notify the woman in time and take back the certificate, and only found a replacement on the Xuexin website? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, the student status files during college, the memories of teachers and classmates, the original transcript that the woman in question claimed to have in her hand, the school’s official graduation requirements for non-teaching majors at the time, and the actions of the school’s degree evaluators at that time, obtained It is not too difficult to obtain sufficient written and oral evidence to distinguish right from wrong. If this case enters the second instance, both parties will need to rely on these original evidences to piece together the full story of the incident. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Secondly, the issue of information uploaded on Xuexin.com also deserves further clarification. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Judging from the administrative ruling provided by the court, the woman involved claimed that “checking through the Xuexin.com showed completion instead of graduation, the date of birth was registered incorrectly and the degree certificate information was not uploaded.” . Judging from the screenshots reported by the media, the woman in question was born on June 8, while the information on Xuexin Online stated that she was born on June 11. Such errors of month and day will inevitably leave the outside world with the impression that the school is sloppy. This is something the school needs to explain. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, we should also ask, when did the school upload the information from Xuexin.com? Why was the woman involved not notified in time when uploading the information on Xuexin.com? Public information shows that Xuexin.com &quot;completed the construction of a database of higher education qualifications since 1991&quot; in October 2003. If the woman involved learns about the time limit for prosecution, the reason for rejection is &quot;the twenty-year prosecution period has expired.&quot; There are areas worth debating. At least it should be clear about the exact time when the school uploads the information to Xuexin.com so that the court can determine the time limit for prosecution. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Thirdly, this incident caused some waves in the public opinion field. Some people think that even if the woman in question really just graduated, since she can find a high-paying job based on her skills, it would be too harsh to have her employment affected by her academic qualifications from 20 years ago. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This argument received a lot of support. However, although the importance of academic qualifications cannot be generalized, it does have its significance and value on different occasions and at various time points. In fact, employers vary widely, and so do the personal circumstances of applicants. If the person concerned has a problem with his or her academic qualifications and has not encountered any obstacles to employment in the past, it does not mean that an employer that is willing to provide a high-paying job will not happen to take advantage of this. Employers have greater discretion over whether and how important an applicant&#39;s academic qualifications are, not to mention that falsification involves integrity issues. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In short, many details of this case are murky, and both the woman involved and the school need stronger evidence for their arguments. The issue of academic qualifications is a matter of integrity and should be taken seriously. Now that this case has become a public issue, it is necessary for the school to conduct an in-depth investigation into this academic qualifications incident, produce more original evidence, restore the truth, set the record straight, and respond to external concerns. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 09 Oct 2023 23:25:05 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[高铁超员报警无法发车，广州南站通报]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258313]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-09 22:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;[Explanation on the online overcrowding alarm of G541 train]&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2023 October On March 6, the G541 train from Zhengzhou East to Guangzhou South arrived at Shaoguan Station.

I always feel very awkward, because when we were studying, the word &quot;jiá&quot; was the original word for &quot;stop suddenly&quot; and &quot;jiá&quot;. Check &quot;Chinese Dictionary&quot; and &quot;Hanyu Dictionary&quot; and you will find that this word is not polyphonic even now. Only when the word &quot;口&quot; is added next to it, can you pronounce &quot;GA [ɡā]&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It’s different now. The &quot;Modern Chinese Dictionary&quot; probably started from the 6th edition (I don’t have an earlier version at hand), and added the sound ɡā to this word. There is only one meaning below: &quot;Cannes (ɡā&amp;nbsp ;nà), French place name.&quot; This means that as a transliterated word, &quot;ɡā&amp;nbsp;nà&quot; can be pronounced loudly and openly. If you correct this reading, you are wrong. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Actually, this is a double misunderstanding. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Cannes International Film Festival (Cannes International Film Festival) is named after the place where it is held. According to the principle of following the owner, it is translated as Cannes. It is the translation closest to the French pronunciation, which is translated as &quot;Cannes&quot; , it’s too far away to be measured. This was originally an error made by the translators at that time in determining the translation name due to lack of audio-visual information. Checking the newspaper database of the Republic of China, there was a news report in the &quot;Central Daily News&quot; on August 18, 1944, &quot;France occupied nine towns eight miles deep, and the Allies took control of Cannes and forced Toulon.&quot; It can be seen that this translation has a long history, but At that time, there were more news articles using &quot;Cancheng&quot;. It can be seen that newspapers in the late Qing Dynasty and the Republic of China put a lot of effort into reviewing and naming. Unfortunately, later generations chose the mistranslated one. &quot;Modern Chinese Dictionary&quot;, as a dictionary that takes normativeness as its own responsibility, should not use &quot;convention&quot; (not &quot;custom&quot;) as &quot;I follow the crowd&quot; (not necessarily &quot;the crowd&quot;) on the basis of mistranslation. As an excuse, he proposed a new pronunciation for the word &quot;Jia&quot; that has no basis in literature. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;General British and American people are probably confused about the pronunciation of the place name Cannes. In 2013, the Fox TV station with the highest ratings in the United States (the audience is mainly American &quot;red necks&quot;) once launched a Twitter Based on a small investigation, the reporter combined the discussions among fans and wrote a very humorous short article: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/how-to-pronounce-cannes-cans-can-or- con&quot;>;&lt;span>;&lt;u>;How to pronounce Cannes: Cans, can or con? | Fox News&lt;/u>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/a>;, the conclusion is that it should be pronounced &quot;Kan&quot;, and the pronunciation is between English between the words can and ken. The online pronunciation of &quot;Cambridge English Dictionary&quot; is the same as when can is stressed:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/pronunciation/english/cannes&quot;>;&lt; span>;&lt;u>;https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/pronunciation/english/cannes&lt;/u>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/a>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;You can predict with the &quot;Modern Chinese Dictionary&quot; &quot;With the blessing of &quot;Cannes (ɡā&amp;nbsp;nà)&quot;, the translation of &quot;Cannes (ɡā&amp;nbsp;nà)&quot;, which is &quot;uniquely made in Cannes&quot;, is bound to become popular, and all efforts to block the car will &quot;come to an abrupt end&quot;.

According to the investigators of the task force, &quot;Following the clues of medical representatives returning kickbacks to hospital public officials, we dug into the issue of Jiang Huashan, the party secretary of the hospital, who was suspected of accepting bribes, and took measures to detain him.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; After investigation, Jiang Huashan took advantage of his position as Secretary of the Party Committee and President of the Sixth Hospital to open accounts in the hospital for relevant companies, and provided services to more than 10 pharmaceutical companies in the introduction and sales of drugs, equipment, and consumables, construction of engineering projects, and payment collection. The representatives provided help, and the amount of bribes they received was as high as more than 6 million yuan, and the medical representatives obtained improper benefits of more than 30 million yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Driven by Jiang Huashan’s corruption and the interests of high kickbacks, corruption has become common within Yibin Sixth People’s Hospital. A small number of hospital managers did not care about medical skills, and once only wanted to make money. There was even a ridiculous phenomenon in which the deputy director of the department passively sabotaged his work when the rebates for consumables were unevenly distributed, and used the excuse of resignation to force the director to share more of the stolen money. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Under the strong shock of the serious disciplinary and illegal cases of Jiang Huashan and Luo Xiance, the Yibin Municipal Commission for Discipline Inspection and Supervision also launched simultaneous educational warnings throughout the city. As of August this year, through in-depth and meticulous ideological and political work, more than 1,100 medical staff in Yibin City have voluntarily surrendered or clarified their problems. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Staff at all levels of the hospital collected kickbacks, and unscrupulous drug dealers were used to get through them at all levels&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The corruption case at Yibin Sixth People&#39;s Hospital is not an isolated case. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On July 6 this year, according to the &quot;Integrity Yibin&quot; report, Xie Mingjun, former Party Secretary and President of Yibin First People&#39;s Hospital, was expelled from the Party for serious violations of discipline and law; former Party Committee member of Yibin First People&#39;s Hospital, Vice President Yang Li seriously violated discipline and law and was expelled from the party and public office. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Soon after, the confession videos of Xie Mingjun and Yang Li sparked heated discussions on social platforms. In the video, Xie Mingjun cried: &quot;I hate myself and have done a lot of ridiculous things. What do I need so much money for?&quot; Yang Li also cried bitterly: &quot;How can I support myself after being released from prison after more than ten years?&quot;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;According to the &quot;Integrity Sichuan&quot; WeChat public account, Xie Mingjun went from director of general surgery to model dean, national second-level professor, and academic expert. When faced with unscrupulous businessmen coming from all directions, he did not resist the temptation. Start accepting &quot;rebates&quot; and &quot;favorable fees&quot; from drug dealers and equipment manufacturers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the Yibin First People&#39;s Hospital, hospital leaders, pharmaceutical committees, pharmacy departments, departments and medical staff were infiltrated by unscrupulous drug dealers and purchased drugs with kickbacks. Bribery payments generally reached 30% of the drug price, up to 50%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The relevant person in charge of the Yibin Municipal Commission for Discipline Inspection and Supervision pointed out that this case not only exposed the loopholes in the internal supervision and management of Yibin First People&#39;s Hospital and the construction of medical ethics and medical ethics, but also exposed the problems in the city&#39;s medical system. Common problems existing in the supervision and management of centralized drug procurement. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After Xie Mingjun was detained, Shi Jun, the retired former party secretary and president of the Fifth People’s Hospital of Yibin, also failed to escape investigation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to his confession, during his 23 years in office, he took advantage of his position, accepted various bribes, and used ill-gotten gains to purchase 8 cars and 7 properties, including a Porsche Cayenne, a Mercedes-Benz S300, Touareg has real estate mainly in Sichuan, Yunnan, Hainan and other places, and has about 6 million yuan in cash. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From serving as the dean in 1999 to retiring to the second line in 2021, Shi Jun has firmly grasped the full say in the hospital&#39;s commercial procurement, personnel appointments and dismissals, infrastructure, etc., and cultivated confidants in key positions to ensure smooth communication. A channel through which power can be realized. The &quot;paternalistic&quot; style has already eroded the rules and regulations to pieces, making the hospital management and employees surrender to them, and internal supervision is completely out of control. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the &quot;Integrity Outlook&quot; report, Yibin City has detained 13 public officials, including 3 county-level cadres, including 11 &quot;top leaders&quot;, and used &quot;four forms&quot; to deal with more than 1,200 people . &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;The dean of the county hospital’s under-construction inpatient buildings has been “taken as a shareholder and receive dividends”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In addition to Yibin, there are also corruption cases in the medical field in Neijiang, Deyang and other places in Sichuan Equally shocking. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since July last year, Neijiang Municipal Commission for Discipline Inspection and Supervision has successively reported and exposed Liu Yu, the former Party Secretary of Dongxing District People’s Hospital of Neijiang City, Liu Xiaoping, the former director of Zizhong County Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital, and the former Longchang Municipal People’s Hospital. Zhang Zongming and others were expelled from the party and public offices for serious violations of discipline and law. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In April 2022, the Neijiang Municipal Commission for Discipline Inspection and Supervision received clues about Zhang Zongming, the former director of Longchang Municipal People’s Hospital, regarding disciplinary and illegal violations. In view of the large number of projects in the medical and health system, the large amounts involved, and the complex local relationship network Regarding the situation, the Discipline Inspection and Supervision Commissions of Neijiang City and Dongxing District simultaneously intervened in the investigation and found that the amount involved in the case by Zhang Zongming amounted to more than 15 million yuan. In October of the same year, Zhang Zongming was expelled from the party and public office for serious violations of discipline and law. He was sentenced to ten years and nine months in prison by the Dongxing District People&#39;s Court for accepting bribes. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Recently, the &quot;Integrity Sichuan&quot; WeChat public account disclosed the corruption path of Liu Xiaoping, the former deputy party secretary and president of Zizhong County Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital in Neijiang. From &quot;saying hello&quot; in hospital procurement to &quot;sharing dividends&quot; in engineering construction, he accepted all orders regardless of the amount or property. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu Xiaoping not only charges &quot;thank you fees&quot; for purchasing drugs and medical equipment, but even the field of engineering construction has become a &quot;nursing place&quot; for him to make money. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2009, when the Zizhong County People&#39;s Hospital was building a new inpatient building, the project owner Peng Mou promised to share a certain amount of profits with Liu Xiaoping after the project was completed in the name of &quot;buying shares&quot; to jointly undertake the construction. The project progress payment was disbursed as scheduled, and Liu Xiaoping received the first &quot;shareholding dividend&quot; of 600,000 yuan. In the following five years, Liu Xiao would receive an average &quot;dividend&quot; each time the project progress payment was disbursed, totaling 2.8 million yuan. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Subsequently, Liu Xiaoping accepted everything from a pack of cigarettes and a few bottles of wine to 10,000 to 20,000 yuan in cash to hundreds of thousands of yuan in cash, no matter the amount or the amount of property. From 2008 to 2021, Liu Xiaoping took advantage of his position to make a lot of money in drug procurement, engineering construction, etc., providing convenience for others to allocate funds for drugs, medical equipment, medical equipment, and engineering funds, and accepting gifts from others. The total amount of cash received was 17.587 million yuan, and the cumulative amount received in violation of disciplines and laws reached 20.1209 million yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On September 14 this year, the &quot;Integrity Sichuan&quot; WeChat public account announced that Zhang Dejun, former deputy secretary of the Party Committee and president of Deyang Second People&#39;s Hospital, had seriously violated discipline and law and was expelled from the party and public office. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The report pointed out that Zhang Dejun accepted gifts and gifts that may affect the fair execution of official duties, was passive and slack in his work, was superficial, and had problems with formalism and bureaucracy; violated organizational principles, and acted inappropriately during the recruitment of employees. Seeking benefits for others and not truthfully explaining problems when organizing inquiries; owning shares in unlisted companies and engaging in money and sex transactions; being indifferent to the masses and apportioning expenses to enterprises in violation of regulations; incorrectly performing duties, interfering and intervening in construction project contracting; ethics Corruption and pursuit of vulgar taste; turning public power into a tool for personal gain, willing to be &quot;hunted&quot;, taking advantage of the convenience of one&#39;s position to seek benefits for others and accept property in aspects such as medical equipment procurement, medical consumables procurement, employee recruitment and recruitment, etc. , a huge amount. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 09 Oct 2023 20:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[既要个人自由与空间，又要老人带孩子？权利与义务应对等]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258206]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-09 19:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;The Internet has brought everything closer and faster. &quot;Chinese Grandma&quot; has become popular internationally. Many &quot;Foreigners&quot; have all heard: Chinese elderly parents take care of their children in the morning, do housework during the day, and take care of the whole family at night. It is harder than working, and it is free, and they even use their own pensions to subsidize their children. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Someone posted on the Internet the daily schedule of elderly parents and parents-in-law: starting from 6 a.m., while their sons, daughters, daughters-in-law, and sons-in-law are still asleep, the elderly get up and go to the vegetable market to buy food. The freshest vegetables. Then prepare breakfast, change the grandchildren&#39;s diapers, feed the grandchildren, and greet the children, daughter-in-law, and husband-in-law to wake up and have breakfast. After the adults went to work, the old man did not stop. He was busy all morning, cleaning the house and taking care of his grandchildren several times, including feeding and urinating. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At noon, the elderly are preparing lunch one after another, and some younger generations go home for lunch (in first-tier metropolises such as Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen, there is almost no possibility of going home for lunch), and then they can take a rest, because The grandchildren are taking a lunch break. A few hours later, the grandchild woke up, changed diapers, fed milk, and then took her downstairs to the community garden to play and bask in the sun. After returning, the old man continued to cook dinner, and then the children, daughter-in-law, and husband-in-law went home for dinner, washed pots and dishes, and took care of the children to sleep...&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It was really busy from morning to night, far exceeding the labor law stipulated, as well as the 8-hour daily shift in the domestic industry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This kind of work even leads to conflicts: in the circle of friends, there is a son who has a child. His parents come to Beijing to help take care of him and hire a nanny, but he is extremely busy every day. It’s early for his son to come home at 10:30 p.m., and the couple often can’t sleep until after 12 p.m. The old man cooked three meals for seven people. His daughter-in-law required that the dishes and chopsticks should be scalded with boiling water and sterilized for each meal. Due to different living habits, the old man sometimes forgets, so it often makes trouble. His wife said, &quot;How about we run away secretly?&quot; Let’s go home.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A friend came back from the UK to visit relatives and took her foreign husband and mother-in-law to travel to China. Her foreign mother-in-law was afraid to come at first for fear of becoming a &quot;Chinese grandma.&quot; After arriving, I saw that almost all of the community was elderly people taking care of their children, and I said seriously, &quot;This is the biggest irresponsibility for children.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The theory of foreign mothers-in-law is: 1. It is more conducive for children to grow up if they are brought up by their own parents and enhances the relationship between them and their parents. 2. Intergenerational education will produce contradictions and conflicts. Because the world of the elderly is the past few decades, and there is a big gap between the world of the children and the future decades, the children they cultivate have many weaknesses in their character. 3. Where are the life, space and rights of the elderly? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The foreign old lady also said: Foreign elderly people all have plans for their old age. She also wants to travel around the world, participate in community activities, prune roses in the garden, and write memoirs (we may wonder: what kind of memoirs do ordinary people write? ?). She believes that Chinese elderly people are very empty inside. They have been pushed away by work before retirement and have become fallen leaves with no &quot;pushing&quot; motivation behind them and no sense of direction. Therefore, they have no choice but to find a sense of presence in their own children and even intervene in the lives of their grandchildren, just like He works hard like a martyr and places the value of his life on the dependence, respect and gratitude of his children, grandchildren and other young people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This old lady also believes that children should be independent after turning 18, live on campus when they go to college, rent their own house when working, have their own boyfriend and girlfriend, and apply for unemployment benefits if they are unfortunate enough to lose their jobs. ...How can you reach your 30s and still use your parents&#39; pension to use your parents as slave labor on the pretext of being grandchildren? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Westerners’ life style, social environment, way of thinking, etc. are all very different from ours. It does not mean that their views and lifestyles are correct and advanced. It is right to listen to the objectionable words as foreign voices. Some views can cause reflection. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;rights&quot; that Westerners talk about actually have their counterpart here: for the elderly to help you take care of your children is a matter of affection, not an obligation. This is true whether it is in terms of law, social ethics, or family and emotional aspects. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Our Eastern culture uses family settlements and blood relationships as ties to weave its own atmosphere of life. Therefore, we pay attention to the intertwining and entanglement of &quot;father&#39;s kindness and son&#39;s filial piety&quot;, mutual debt, repayment of family affection, and gratitude... In Confucian culture, it is called &quot;kissing&quot;, and in other parts of East Asia, it is also called &quot;righteousness&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The modern/modern changes in Asia-Pacific society driven by the &quot;Western Wind Spreading from the East&quot; for more than a hundred years have made East Asian societies pay more and more attention to individual rights in modern society on the basis of &quot;kinship&quot; culture. It may simplify and weaken the social relationship of mutual entanglement and debt between relatives and friends. More and more young people are beginning to pursue individual rights, individual development, and individual realization that are similar to Westernization. In recent decades, wages in East Asian societies have grown faster than in Western societies, which is evidence of this development. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, we only need the &quot;individualism&quot; of Western culture, but not its concept of &quot;equivalence of rights and obligations&quot;; we need both the &quot;self-realization&quot; benefits of Western culture and the &quot;kissing&quot; of Eastern culture. Benefits, taking advantage of parents, but unwilling to take any responsibility. For example, the son mentioned above came home from playing until 10:30 in the evening (so-called socializing and socializing). This is too unethical. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Due to our living habits, it is impossible for us to copy the Western lifestyle. However, it should become a social responsibility to clarify the boundaries of the rights of the elderly, yourself, children and grandchildren, and not to take advantage of your parents all your life. At least, you cannot treat your parents as long-term workers who do not have to pay, or even use them as long-term workers while &quot;gnawing at the elderly&quot; and taking out the wallets of elderly parents. Basic consensus. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This problem is on the children&#39;s side on the one hand and the elderly parents on the other. I often hear elderly people say: their children are too busy and hard at work, so help them if you can. This kind of thinking is: children will never grow up. The children they cultivate are also happy to lie in their parents&#39; arms until they are fifty or sixty years old. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Do the elderly in Western societies help their children and grandchildren? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The answer is yes. According to statistics from the U.S. &quot;Population and Development Review&quot;: nearly 1/3 of the elderly in the United States have helped take care of their families. Americans spend a total of 1.2 billion hours caring for their families each week, equivalent to 30.5 million &quot;nanny&quot; positions. 20% of elderly Americans said they had taken their grandchildren on vacation without their parents. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Statistics show that Americans in their 30s take care of the most children, followed by “grandfathers and grandmothers” in their 60s, while elderly people aged 60-79 rarely help take care of their grandchildren. Especially older American men in this age group are least willing to take care of babies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;79% of older people in the UK say they feel spending time with their grandchildren helps them stay young. But less than a third of British elderly people believe that they have &quot;taught their grandchildren more.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;How British elders look after their children: prepare tea or dinner for their grandchildren, supervise their children for a few hours after school when their parents are unable to arrive due to work, and play card games with their children. , and teaching children how to be brave. British grandparents proudly say they spend nearly 10 hours a week with their grandchildren. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It can be seen that in general, in European and American societies, there are limits to the elderly&#39;s ability to help their children, and the elderly&#39;s love for their children and grandchildren is also more restrained. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We spend an average of 1.5 hours together every day. According to our standards, this is not taking care of the children, but just taking them to play for a while. But from the point of view of the British elderly: According to the standard of &quot;Chinese grandma&quot;, she is not taking care of her children. She is clearly treating us as slave labor and even taking out my wallet. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, if the elderly look at the lives of their children: it is true that they are busy at work, but their children spend a lot of time playing outside and at home, and they can spend hours watching short videos. &quot;Chinese grandmas&quot; cannot be the hands-off shopkeepers like British grandmas, but they can let go of their children appropriately and send them away for a few years but not for a lifetime. This is beneficial to the personality growth and responsibility of one&#39;s son, daughter, daughter-in-law, son-in-law and grandchildren. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Old parents and children should understand that it is a matter of affection, not obligation, for the elderly to help take care of their children. Even if the love is deep, it should be stopped in moderation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is the author&#39;s personal opinion only and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot; https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style= &quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 09 Oct 2023 19:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[记汉学家叶果夫]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258170]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-09 18:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/06/NKdIy3ol8Ge1jnlPZgoynhIMn5hqbD0hIy7QTvqc.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;896&quot; height=&quot;722&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/06/NKdIy3ol8Ge1jnlPZgoynhIMn5hqbD 0hIy7QTvqc. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253111&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In 2012, the authors of this article, Zhang Fusheng and Ye Guofu (pictured left), were published in People&#39;s Literature Publishing House Group photo in the company&#39;s office. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo provided by the author)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Russian sinologist Yegov (Игорь Aлександрович Егоров) passed away. He was one year younger than me. He was born in 1953 and left before he was seventy. According to our Chinese concept, it was a bit early. Maybe he had a bad life and stayed up late for a long time to translate, which damaged his health. My friend Mr. Liu Xianping from the Writers Association told me that he suffers from diabetes, which is so severe that he is about to have his limbs amputated. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the history of Sino-Russian cultural exchanges, Yegov can be regarded as a very contributory figure. First, as the Chinese editor of the Soviet State Literature Publishing House, he devoted great efforts to introducing Chinese literature to the Soviet Union and later to Russia for decades. Secondly, as a Russian sinologist, he translated the works of some writers during the May 4th Movement period such as Mao Dun. Later, he focused mainly on contemporary Chinese literature. The writers he translated included Su Tong, Yu Hua, Mo Yan, Bi Feiyu, etc. He has also translated some English works, but, in his own words, it is to earn royalties and support the Chinese literature he loves to translate. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For me, Yegov is my colleague in work. In terms of business, we can provide each other with practical and useful help and solve problems on the manuscript. At the same time, we are also friends who can open our hearts and exchange ideas, even though our views are sometimes inconsistent or even diametrically opposed on certain issues. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/06/FRX7dNtX47uH6giJM1SY6JrX5OfBBtjIW5eTIhRk.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;646&quot; height= &quot;944&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/06/FRX7dNtX47uH6giJM1SY6JrX5OfBBtjIW5eTIhRk.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253112&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Photo taken during Ye Guofu&#39;s first visit to Beijing in the 1990s. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo provided by the author)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Ten Days in Beijing&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Ye Guo and I The first time I met my husband was in March 1990. As the Chinese editor of the Leningrad branch of the Soviet State Literature Publishing House, he came to visit the People’s Literature Publishing House where I worked. At that time, Sino-Soviet relations had just begun to normalize. I remember that after the &quot;Selected Novels of Rasputin&quot; that I edited was published in 1982, I gave the author several donated books at the request of the Soviet Embassy. I sent the gift letter to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs as required, and they handed it over to the Soviet Embassy. In 2006, Rasputin came to Beijing Foreign Studies University for a meeting. He told me that he had only heard that a collection of his novels had been published in China, but he had never seen it. When Sholokhov passed away in 1984, researcher Sun Meiling of the Institute of Foreign Languages ​​and Literatures of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences wrote a short message, but there was no place to publish it. The same is true in the publishing industry. It was not until 1986 and 1987 that the leaders of the Soviet State Literature Publishing House and the People&#39;s Literature Publishing House realized mutual visits. In 1989, when our older generation editors Sun Shengwu, Jiang Lu, Xu Leiran, Chen Siyong, and Lu Yongfu visited the Soviet Union, they also visited their publishing house. This time they came to visit for ten days. The formal talks were translated by old comrade Mr. Cheng Wen. I was only responsible for accompanying them on sightseeing and shopping, so everyone was relatively relaxed and casual, talking and laughing. I no longer went to the Soviet Union in the early 1980s. That kind of nervousness at the embassy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Four editors came to this visit from the Soviet State Literature Publishing House: Director of the Foreign Literature Editorial Office Klimova, English editor; Chinese editor Yaroslavsky, an old comrade who is over 60 years old , has translated many Chinese classical literary works, and he translated the poems in the Russian version of &quot;Jin Ping Mei&quot;; and Yura Ilyashin, a young Chinese editor who came to China in 1984 as a reporter for the TASS News Agency and reformed After the opening up, he set up a company in China and published the newspaper &quot;Hand to Hand&quot;. These three people are all from the Moscow headquarters, while Yegov is from the Leningrad branch, and his name on his business card is the director of the editorial office. It seemed that he was not very familiar with the three people at the head office, so I took more care of him and spent a longer time chatting with him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During the conversation, I learned that Yegov, Yura and I both started learning each other&#39;s language in the early 1970s, shortly after the &quot;Zhenbao Island Incident&quot;. The purpose is self-evident and everyone knows it well. I told Ye Guofu that in 1969 I was an educated youth, and the Heilongjiang Production and Construction Corps station where I was located was only 95 kilometers away from Zhenbao Island. His eyes widened in surprise. I continued to tell him: Back then, there was an old high school senior in the company who taught everyone how to speak Russian every morning. I remember the first sentence I learned was: &quot;Raise your hands!&quot; He was startled at first, and was stunned for a moment, but he immediately became alert. Di replied in Chinese: &quot;Hand in the gun and not kill!&quot; We both laughed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another reason why Yegov and I had more contact during those ten days was that our speaking skills were pretty much the same. Yura was stationed in Beijing in 1984 when he was a reporter. I met him at the embassy. His listening and speaking abilities were better than ours. I talked with Yegov. He rushed to speak Chinese and I rushed to speak Russian. He only spoke his own language when he really didn&#39;t understand. It seemed that he was afraid of losing the opportunity to exercise and suffer a disadvantage. Yegov is a shy man. He blushes when seeing our old comrades. He speaks softly and has an elegant manner. He is very Leningrader and not as flamboyant as a Muscovite. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When they came, they were very interested in shopping, but shopping is my weakness. Every day after get off work, I would memorize Russian words that I might need the next day until late at night. Despite careful preparation, there were still many troubles. One morning, the four of them said seriously that they wanted to buy a must-buy food entrusted by a friend. It was round and colorful in shape and would grow bigger when fried in oil. Yaroslavsky also ridiculously made a sudden explosion with his hands, and made a &quot;pop&quot; sound from his mouth at the same time. The more vividly they described it, the richer my imagination became. I couldn&#39;t figure it out, so I had to lead them into the Dongdan Vegetable Market. We divided the troops into four groups, each of them holding an aisle, and searched carefully. After a while, Klimova&#39;s cry of surprise came. I went over to take a look and it turned out to be shrimp crackers. In order to avoid such trouble and lively atmosphere, I invited Mr. Gao Mang when I visited the Great Wall. He spoke very well. The four guests were extremely excited to see Gao Mang, as if meeting old friends in a foreign land, and they poured out all the words they had been holding in their hearts for several days. Yegov told me that Mr. Gao Mang was very famous in the Soviet Union. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The main result of their visit was to confirm the publishing plans of both parties in the next three years: Su Fang published &quot;Nie Haihua&quot;, &quot;Selected Poems of the Song Dynasty&quot;, &quot;Dream of Red Mansions&quot; and selected works by Guo Moruo, Lao She and Mao Dun; our publisher Published several volumes of &quot;Collected Works of Tolstoy&quot;, &quot;Collected Works of Pushkin&quot;, &quot;Selected Works of Turgenev&quot; and an &quot;Encyclopedic Dictionary of Literature&quot;. The most important thing is that the two publishing houses will each publish a collection of contemporary novels from the other, and the selections will be recommended by the other. The People&#39;s Literature Publishing House completed this project in the second year, but the Soviet State Literature Publishing House failed to publish it until it was disbanded. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;My personal gain is that my hearing has improved. They tell Soviet jokes every day, and sometimes I can’t believe my ears. In my impression, Yegov didn&#39;t say a word, and always maintained a gentlemanly attitude, as if he was listening. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/06/XxLnwV880wUjnjlmhS6tWDYQLFbVcyMwEE1N951f.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1029&quot; height= &quot;750&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/06/XxLnwV880wUjnjlmhS6tWDYQLFbVcyMwEE1N951f.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253114&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Yegov and the author of this article in front of the People&#39;s Literature Publishing House. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo provided by the author)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Three-month internship&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;1991 In May, I was dispatched by the Press and Publication Administration to work as an intern editor at the Soviet State Literary Publishing House. Klimova and Yura Ilyashin, who had just visited our publisher in 1990, were responsible for receiving me and were very warm to me. They also held a welcome meeting for the external editors&#39; office, met with their leaders at all levels, and visited their publishing house. , they treat me like a newly assigned colleague. By the way, this publishing house, especially the configuration of language staff in the foreign literature editing room, is very similar to our publishing house, except that there are more editors in the Indian language group. After I came back and talked about this situation, President Chen Wanchun said: It should be said that we are just like them. President Feng Xuefeng visited this publishing house in 1951, and our publishing house adopted the configuration of their publishing houses when it was first established. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On June 19, according to their arrangements, we arrived in Leningrad. As the head of the branch, Yegov received us and accompanied us on literary sightseeing every day - many writers in the history of literature have left their footprints in Leningrad. Yegov is a native of Leningrad, and he also knows many stories about the corners. . After visiting Tsarskoye Selo on June 24, while resting on the lawn in front of the square, Yegov and I had a debate about the October Revolution and socialism. We spoke Russian for a while and Chinese for a while. The accompanying staff laughed. . Yegov told me some social situations, which surprised me. When I was eating in the cafeteria of the Moscow headquarters, I heard someone say that I thought it was because of my poor hearing and I didn&#39;t understand, but I always felt that something happened. I asked Yura, and his answer was vague and obviously prevaricating, unlike Yegov&#39;s straightforwardness. At that time, the Soviet Union was experiencing painful struggles before its death. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On August 16, 1991, we ended our three-month internship in the Soviet Union and returned to Beijing. Four days later, the &quot;8·19&quot; incident that shocked the world occurred in Moscow&#39;s Red Square. The Soviet Union collapsed on December 25 of the same year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/06/u4OebnAlHlHNyPKHIOtGbGBubmFSfLht7XayGjrl.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;803&quot; height= &quot;574&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/06/u4OebnAlHlHNyPKHIOtGbGBubmFSfLht7XayGjrl.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253110&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Photographed in Yegov&#39;s office in 1992. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo provided by the author)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;One year of further study&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;November 1992 In August, I returned to Leningrad again, this time being sent by the State Education Commission to study for a year. At this time, Leningrad was being renamed St. Petersburg. The first sign to be replaced was the Leningrad Railway Station sign. I specially rushed to watch it. Looking at the slowly falling &quot;Leningrad&quot; sign, I felt extremely complicated. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before I settled down at Leningrad University, Yegov came to see me. Seeing that I was living in a crowded four-person room, he was a little embarrassed, as if he had made such a bad arrangement for me. But within a few days, I was transferred to a single room. One day in the lobby on the first floor, the dormitory administrator stopped me and insisted on chatting with me. He first introduced himself: a member of the Soviet Communist Party and one of the first pilots after the outbreak of the Great Patriotic War. However, he was quickly shot down and transferred to the hospital for treatment. When he recovered and was ready to return to the sky, the war ended. Then he said that he respected me very much and knew that I had introduced many Russian writers to China. He even knew that I had translated the works of Semyonov. This writer was well-known in the Soviet Union and had written works about the Soviet-German spy war. After questioning me carefully, I found out that it was Yegov who told him so that he could change me to a better room. This veteran administrator was cunning, selfish, and did some ridiculous things, but he gave me a lot of help during my year of studying abroad. I am very grateful to him, and even more grateful to Yegov. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The publishing house where Yegov worked was located in the most beautiful and lively area on Nevsky Prospekt, on the top floor of the St. Petersburg Bookstore. This building, built in the 18th century, is opposite the famous Kazan Church, so it welcomes a large number of tourists from all over the world every day. As one of the largest bookstores in Europe, St. Petersburg Bookstore not only sells the latest books in Russia and various foreign publications, but also a variety of cultural supplies and souvenirs. It also often holds various book fairs, book clubs, new book launches and author signings. Book signing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Leningrad University where I have classes every day is right by the Neva River. I can walk across the bridge to Nevsky Prospekt. If I take the subway, it is just one stop away, so I often come to this bookstore. As a publisher, I like it here. Besides, Yegov is upstairs. When you are tired, you can go to his office to sit, drink hot water and smoke a cigarette. There are benches in the corridor where you can lie down. Most of the people in their editorial office knew me, and they entertained me when Yegov was away. Ye Guofu was obsessed with translation at that time and always looked forward to my going. Sometimes he knew that I had gone to the bookstore but not upstairs, and he still didn&#39;t understand. Almost every time he went, he would take out a few pages of paper prepared in advance, with problems to be solved written on them. There was a space after each question for me to write my opinion, and I just had to rewrite it into sentences he could understand. Ye Guofu is a very smart man. This way, we can avoid misunderstandings due to oral expressions and leave the words in black and white for him to ponder carefully. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I remember that I helped him do one thing, which was the project signed by the two publishers in 1990 - each other published a collection of contemporary novels from each other, and the task of the Russian version of the collection of contemporary Chinese novels was handed over to him. Yegov. At that time, the Chinese manuscripts recommended by the Chinese side were piled on his desk. According to the editing style, each writer had a biography. These biographies were all handwritten by the writers themselves, with different number of words and different styles and formats. Some even included the words &quot;Cultural Revolution&quot;. &quot;The allegro lyrics created by Zhongzai&#39;s publicity team were also included. Lao Ye was confused and asked me for help with a grimace. I rewrote it into a hundred words. Lao Ye understood and was very grateful. It took me some time and effort so I remember. Ye Guofu mentioned this matter several times when he came to Beijing and felt sorry for me because the book was not published in the end. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At that time, he had finished translating Su Tong&#39;s &quot;Wives and Concubines&quot; and asked me to &quot;correct&quot; him. I have not read this novel, but I read it carefully in order to revise Yegov&#39;s translation. Regarding the serious errors in his translation, I only corrected them without explaining them. Instead, I raised objections to his criteria for selecting the translation. I said to him: What the author describes is a very special kind of abnormal life in China and does not have universal typical significance. Furthermore, after being translated into another language, a lot of essence has been lost, which does not reflect the level of contemporary Chinese literary creation. I suggested that he translate &quot;There&#39;s a Snowstorm Tonight&quot; by Liang Xiaosheng. It&#39;s on the recommendation list and I&#39;ve read it. It&#39;s very good. But he said: The content described in this novel is very similar to Khrushchev&#39;s Siberian reclamation, and Russian readers will not like it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yegov worked very hard on translation at that time. In addition to achieving his own lofty goals, there was also a very practical reason. In St. Petersburg in 1993, life was difficult for ordinary people. My teacher told me that sometimes wages are not paid on time. When you get rubles, you have to change them into dollars immediately, and then into rubles when you use them. When we first went there, it seemed that one dollar was exchanged for 300 rubles, and a month later it was exchanged for 400. Half a year later, when I went to Moscow University, I actually got 1,300 rubles in the Vietnamese dormitory. Mr. Qi Yide, who translated &quot;Sanyan Erpai&quot;, was a famous sinologist of the older generation. She called one night and said she had not bought any bread. I would take a short detour to school and pass by her house. Sometimes I would buy some bread or something, hang it on her doorknob, and call her to let her know. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Two Unforgettable Things&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Ye Guofu earned extra money by translating to supplement his family income. From my contact with him, I deeply felt that he was a very family-oriented man who treated his wife and children very much like a good Chinese man. He is also sincere and enthusiastic in helping people, and will go all out when you need him. On August 14, 1993, I received a long-distance call from China from Li Yuxia, director of the foreign literature editorial office of our newspaper. She asked me to immediately find a solution to the problem of &quot;Destruction&quot;, &quot;Young Guards&quot; and &quot;Quiet Don&quot;. There is a copyright issue because there are domestic publishers who took action before us. From the tone of her voice and the speed of her speech, I could tell that the situation was critical. These three books are the standing books of our society, especially the latter two. They have been reprinted every year since the early 1980s. As soon as we joined the Berne Convention, publishers came to snatch us up. As the editor in charge of these three books, I was naturally impatient. I found Yegov on the same day and explained the situation to him. The next day he helped me contact Sholokhov’s copyright heir, his daughter Svetlana. She told me that she had indeed received an application from a Chinese publisher, but had not signed it yet. She also told me that Sholokhov once had the opportunity to visit China, but it was a pity that he did not make the trip. Svetlana promised that the copyright would be given to People&#39;s Literature Publishing House. From her words, I felt that Yegov had talked to her beforehand, and she knew everything, so I didn’t need to waste any words. Two days later, I went to the Moscow Literary Publishing House. Yura helped me contact Fadeev’s widow. Her answer reassured me: “My sample books are all published by the People’s Literature Publishing House. Of course, this book is also Published by you.&quot; The thing that made me panic was solved smoothly with the help of two friends. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is another thing that makes me very grateful to Yegov. In September 1993, my wife was coming to Leningrad to visit relatives. There were no mobile phones at that time, and it was difficult to make long-distance calls. Somehow, Ye Guov became the hub of communication between me and my wife, the &quot;mouthpiece&quot; for information, probably because there was a phone in his office that could make international long distance calls. He seemed to be an official at that time. I checked the diary from that year and found that Ye Guofu came to my dormitory five or six times that month. The last time was at eight o&#39;clock in the evening, telling my wife the time of departure from Beijing and arrival in Moscow. Why didn&#39;t you tell me over the phone? Maybe it was because I was afraid that I wouldn’t understand and misunderstood, so I talked about it in person and wrote it down on a piece of paper. It shows how serious and reliable he is. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A few days after his wife arrived, Yegov invited us to his home. He even picked us up at the subway station that day. In fact, I have been to his house many times and the route is very familiar to me. When he entered, his wife dressed up to welcome him very warmly and set a table full of delicious food. An interesting thing happened before dinner started. I was browsing his collection of books in Yegov&#39;s room. Yegov, who was originally translating for the host and guest, walked in quietly, patted my shoulder gently, and pointed outside. I looked over and saw two ladies sitting on the sofa who didn&#39;t understand each other&#39;s language at all. They were beaming and talking animatedly. Yegov and I looked at each other for a moment and almost laughed. We had a great time that day, and the two ladies hugged each other at the subway entrance before parting, like good sisters who have been friends for many years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/06/oQHaE8Mt6wDy1tGR95ozF8U59FdOQEjP97UhYA8M.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;908&quot; height= &quot;522&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/06/oQHaE8Mt6wDy1tGR95ozF8U59FdOQEjP97UhYA8M.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253113&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In 2012, Ye Guofu (second from left) and Mo Yan (third from left) met at the People&#39;s Literature Publishing House. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo provided by the author)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;See you again in twenty years&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; In the first few years after returning to China, I still communicated with Ye Guofu and asked someone to take care of me. Later, we lost contact. Around 2000, someone told me that the original Soviet State Literature Publishing House was dissolved and no longer existed. Until 2012, a colleague told me that Ye Guofu came to me online and said that he would come to Beijing to hold an international seminar for sinologists. Twenty years later, we met at the hotel where he was staying. He held my hand and said that I have not aged, and I held his hand and said that he still looks the same. We all know we are telling lies. We resumed our conversation the next day in my office. I showed him the Russian literary works I had edited and published over the past 20 years, and he told me about his journey in the past 20 years and the works he had translated. He said that he had been reading Mo Yan&#39;s novels for several years, found a feeling for them, and started translating them. When talking about his experience, he also said, like some people, that Mo Yan&#39;s novels were influenced by Western &quot;magic realism&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I told him that most Chinese writers create their own works. As far as the writers I have read, I don’t think any of them have been influenced by foreign writers. If we talk about influence, it is also the region where they were born and their innate personal personalities. These two factors determine their storytelling methods and characteristics. For example, if I ask Mo Yan, he is actually telling the story of the land and water where he was raised in Gaomi, Shandong Province, using his unique storytelling method, just like his fellow Shandong fellow Pu Songling used his method to tell the story of &quot;Liao Zhai Zhi&quot;. &quot;different&quot; same. Their place in Shandong has this long literary tradition and is rich in this kind of literature. Yegov seems to understand vaguely, but I feel that our conversation today seems to be a continuation of the conversation in Leningrad about the criteria for selecting translation works. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I showed him the contemporary Russian literary works published by our agency in the past ten years, including more than a dozen novels and four short story collections, involving more than 70 writers, including those who became famous in the 1950s. There are new works by the old writer Graning, works by the world-famous Rasputin in the 1960s, and award-winning young writers in the 1980s and 1990s. He was very surprised when he saw it. The translated works of Russian contemporary literature published by our publishing house were as good as the translated works of Chinese contemporary literature published in Russia. Probably touching his sadness, he vomited his bitterness to me, saying how difficult it is to publish a Chinese literary work in Russia, not to mention that China has a huge readership of Russian literature, and all the publishing houses in Russia are now He founded a private publishing house and only focused on profits...&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On August 21, 2012, Ye Guofu called and told him that he would meet with Mr. Mo Yan tomorrow and asked me to attend. The location could be in my office. Of course I agree. Mr. Mo Yan came earlier the next day. He gave me two of his books, and I gave me a set of &quot;The Quiet Don River&quot; that I edited. Mr. Mo Yan is a very down-to-earth, sincere and natural person. He does not seem like the kind of person who hides his hidden agenda. In fact, I met him, I remember it was at the Strindberg Seminar at Peking University, and he even gave a speech. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I chatted with Mr. Mo Yan for a while, and then Ye Guofu came. The two of them didn&#39;t seem to know each other very well, and they were a little reserved at first. Yegov was not a good talker. Fortunately, I soon let go. Mr. Mo Yan is still very good at leading the topic and livening up the atmosphere. At that time, I thought Mo Yan was quite eloquent and thought he could tell stories. I heard Mr. Feng Jicai tell a story. It was when he was revising a manuscript at the People&#39;s Literature Publishing House. At that time, he asked to turn off the lights, saying that it would be more effective. So I think most writers have the talent to tell stories. The topic that day basically revolved around Mr. Mo Yan’s creations. The president, Comrade Guan Shiguang, came for more than half an hour. Yegov didn&#39;t talk much. He talked about Chinese literature, especially the &quot;experience&quot; of contemporary Chinese literature in Russia, and how difficult it was to publish his translation of Mo Yan&#39;s works... I also know something about this situation. I participated in several book fairs and book ordering events in Moscow and Leningrad. I never saw a single Chinese literary work, but occasionally came across one or two books with a touch of &quot;Kung Fu&quot;. . By the end of the day, everyone was still chatting happily. I checked the diary of that day: &quot;We chatted from 2 pm to 6 pm, and then had dinner at Jiuyefu Restaurant opposite the publishing house until 8:30.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The day before returning to China, we went together During dinner, Ye Guofu told me that Mr. Liu Zhenyun also wanted to translate a few of his works and asked me to express my opinion. I said: &quot;You know, there is an old saying in China: The writing is like the person. Mo Yan is from Shandong, his writing is straightforward, and he tells stories. Liu Zhenyun is from Henan, his writing is melodramatic, and he has the unique humor of Henan people. His works are exquisite It is taste, and taste is difficult to translate. For example, there is a sentence in Lu Xun&#39;s &quot;The Story in the Hair&quot;: &quot;Most of the families lazily walked out a citizen.&quot; The word &quot;pace&quot; and &quot;国&quot; in it have been translated , is boring. Another example is your translation of &quot;Big Breasts, Wide Butts&quot;. If a Russian writer who has never seen the original work is translated into Chinese based on your translation, it will probably be translated into &quot;Big Breasts, Wide Butts&quot;. &quot;, what&#39;s the taste?&quot; I suddenly realized something was wrong and couldn&#39;t help laughing. Ye Guofu seemed to have realized something, and he laughed out loud. I told him again that when I was an intern at the Moscow Literary Publishing House in 1991, they asked me many questions about the translation of Lao She&#39;s works and &quot;Dream of Red Mansions&quot;, mostly about the &quot;meaning&quot; behind the words. I also told him about the &quot;Water Margin&quot; (Russian-Chinese version of the Greater China Library), which I was responsible for publishing. I carefully compared the problems found in Luo Gaoshou&#39;s translation, and wanted to further prove that what is lost when the two languages ​​are exchanged is the essence. Mainly This is because some words and expressions in Chinese are not found in Russian. Choose carefully. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;The last meeting&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The last time I met Yegov was on August 28, 2014, at the &quot;Chinese-Russian Literature Translation&quot; held at the Russian Embassy Publishing Project&quot; meeting. There were a lot of people that day, and Yegov suddenly dragged the Russian writer Yesin to me, jokingly saying that he wanted to go through the back door: Yesin wanted his &quot;Death of Giants&quot; to be published by the People&#39;s Literature Publishing House. Yesin is a famous Russian writer and the dean of the Gorky Academy of Literature, and this novel is among the books recommended by Russia. So I obtained the consent of Liu Guohui, the leader of the society who came to the meeting with me, and called Mr. Liu Xianping from the Writers Association and the copyright association on the spot. Mr. Zhang Hongbo, the director-general and the person in charge of the &quot;Mutual Translation Project&quot; held a small meeting with Ye Xin and Ye Guofu and decided that &quot;Death of Giants&quot; would be published by our publisher and translated by Liu Xianping. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Probably we are not the only publishing house that works on-site like ours. The venue was always noisy, and Yegov and I never had time to talk alone. When it was about to end, Ye Guofu hurriedly pulled me to a quiet corner and told me excitedly that the Chinese Writers Association gave him a large sum of money, which was enough for him to focus on translation in a few years without having to worry about making a living. . Looking at his slightly moist eyes, I was also very happy. I knew that his life had not been easy over the years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Rest in peace, Igor. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is his nickname, and he likes me to call him that. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 09 Oct 2023 18:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[偷餐者绑天桥示众？店家应该如此喝阻小偷吗？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258289]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-09 17:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;According to the Southern Metropolis Daily, a store in Mixue Bingcheng, Guangzhou issued a handwritten warning for stealing food, saying that those who steal food will be required to He was &quot;tied to a flyover and paraded in public for 8 hours&quot;, sparking heated discussions.
