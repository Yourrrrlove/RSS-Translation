A netizen named &quot;Taishan McDull Button&quot; posted on multiple platforms to show off that he was raising three large Canary dogs in a community in Lixia District, located in the center of Jinan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Screenshots of the man in question&#39;s social media show that in August 2021, he posted a post with a picture saying, &quot;The dog scared the pregnant woman. I also beat the pregnant woman and she stayed at the police station until 11 o&#39;clock&quot;; In January 2022, he posted another article saying, &quot;To commemorate the first snowfall in 2022, the brother and sister bit the Shiba Inu in the community to pieces.&quot; In February 2022, his accompanying picture showed that the dog he raised Large dogs eat under the &quot;Civilized Dog Raising, Scientific Dog Raising&quot; banner set up at the Wenhua East Road Police Station of the Lixia Branch of the Jinan Municipal Public Security Bureau. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since October 2023, the man&#39;s social media has turned to showing off his wealth and power, and has continuously posted &quot;(Three dogs) go out in luxury cars, stay in star hotels, and go out to eat.&quot; hotel&quot;, &quot;a day&#39;s foster care fee is higher than your salary as an office worker&quot; and other content to show off their wealth. On October 24, the man involved posted a video of a policeman knocking on the door with tools, with the text saying, &quot;You check yours and I&#39;ll take care of mine. If you have the ability, you can tear down my door and come in to arrest me.&quot; On October 25, the man involved released the surveillance video again and sarcastically said, &quot;I really worked hard to catch the dog, hahahahaha.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the interaction with netizens, the man in question said, &quot;I go out every day, and I can sneak away as I please.&quot; The image of &quot;abundant&quot; and &quot;monstrous power&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the incident spread online, on the evening of October 30, the Lixia District Public Security Bureau of Jinan issued a notice stating that a man who had recently been rumored on the Internet to &quot;show off raising prohibited dogs&quot; had been administratively detained. &quot;Beating pregnant women&quot; and &quot;you check yours and I&#39;ll keep mine&quot; are all false information. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Two administrative penalty decisions issued by Jinan police also showed that the man’s behavior constituted illegal dog breeding. He surrendered on October 28 and was fined a total of 3,900 yuan; the man’s release The video &quot;The police don&#39;t dare to arrest me even when they come to my door&quot; is a stolen photo of the police investigating and punishing other people&#39;s illegal dog-raising, and then plagiarized it and put it on his own account to boast that he &quot;lacks respect for the law and openly challenges the bottom line of the law.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The timeline of this case shows that the man involved has been doing this for many years and is divided into two parts: offline and online. The current report has not fully answered netizens&#39; questions, and there are still some areas left to be analyzed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The first thing to ask is, is the &quot;power and power&quot; that the man in question flaunted true? Judging from the social media content of the man in question, he clearly has the image of a wealthy young man who is either rich or noble. The pictures distributed also imply that he has a certain &quot;background&quot; and is an existence that others &quot;cannot mess with&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The man in question has repeatedly posted content about his participation in activities within the system, and has also shown his status as &quot;military first.&quot; The Jinan police’s administrative penalty decision also showed that the man involved was affiliated with the Material Management Office of a military region hospital. If the man in question really has some kind of &quot;identity within the system,&quot; his employer should express its condemnation and cut him off. And if the identities the man in question brags about are fabricated, then what he says and does is also suspected of committing a crime. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Military hospital staff are national staff in a broad sense. According to Article 279 of the Criminal Law of the People&#39;s Republic of China, whoever pretends to be a staff member of a state agency and commits fraud, thereby constituting the crime of fraud, shall be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of not more than three years, criminal detention, public surveillance, or deprivation of political rights; if the circumstances are serious, he shall be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of not less than three years but not more than ten years. imprisonment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Secondly, according to the &quot;Red Star News&quot; report, the man in question has kept these three large dogs for many years. The property management, police, and community have come to communicate with them many times, but to no avail. This detail shows that the man in question did not keep large dogs illegally for a day or two, which seriously interfered with the lives of surrounding neighbors, but it was something that people could do nothing about. Combined with his arrogant words and deeds online, the man in question has been suspected of picking quarrels and provoking trouble, which &quot;seriously affects the work, life, production, and business of others.&quot; This is a plot worthy of further investigation by the police. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The police report showed that the man involved was dissatisfied with the regulations related to dog breeding, so he turned to provoke the public, and it took ten days to be brought to justice. I would like to ask, if the man in question did not &quot;blatantly challenge the bottom line of the law,&quot; do the surrounding neighbors still have to endure it? If you think about it further, if the man in question keeps a low profile online but remains arrogant offline, can he continue to be lawless? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Not only are dogs not civil subjects in the legal sense, but even their social attributes in the abstract sense are completely determined by the dog owner’s dog-raising behavior. The illegal behavior of the man in question was not just raising a large prohibited dog without a leash or muzzle, but also magnified the social harm of illegal dog ownership with his arrogant and domineering words and deeds. In addition to administrative penalties, public authorities should also conduct in-depth investigations and investigate the suspects for the crime of cheating and provoking troubles. While cracking down on illegal dog-raising, &quot;dogs fighting against human power&quot; should not be tolerated. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 03 Nov 2023 10:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[“我可以不恋爱，但我的CP一定要结婚”，为什么？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259814]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-03 09:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;In the spring of 2021, Xu Guanwen, born in 1998, began a new and unfamiliar research. At that time, he was still a graduate student at the School of Society and Demography at Renmin University of China. A course on qualitative research methods led him to set his sights on a costume drama called &quot;The Order of Mountains and Rivers&quot;. The relationship between the two protagonists in the play leaves room for the audience to imagine intimate emotions, attracting a large number of &quot;CP fans&quot; to stop. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the East Asian cultural circle, the trend of &quot;consuming CP&quot; has been around for a long time. It first appeared in the ACGN (animation, comics, games, novels) circle and refers to pairing (Coupling) between two characters, referred to as &quot;CP&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Prior to this, Xu Guanwen paid attention to this cultural form twice. The first time was in high school. My deskmate selected two male characters from the Japanese manga &quot;Kuroko&#39;s Basketball&quot; - Aomine Daiki and Kise Ryota, and wrote a CP &quot;fanfic&quot; for them. &quot;Aomine Daiki&#39;s character is aggressive, while Kise Ryota is more elegant and has a wild side inside. Their roles complement each other to a certain extent, and there are certain areas that can be explored.&quot; Although the article written by the same deskmate is only a fragment It&#39;s a sitcom, but Xu Guanwen can feel a &quot;strong emotional connection&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The second time was when he was an undergraduate student in sociology. He was chatting with his graduate student and found that the other party was doing research on &quot;Whether Danmei literature has an impact on real gay men&quot;. He realized that, Popular culture will be related to real-life emotional practices. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2021, thinking of the two intersections with CP culture, Xu Guanwen was once again aroused his &quot;long-standing curiosity&quot;. He started with friends around him and conducted snowball interviews with 55 CP fans, including 53 women and 2 men. Most of the interviewers were surprised at first: Why would a boy who doesn’t take CP want to learn about this issue? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One of the few male CP fans is a fan of the female idol team AKB48. He thinks the members are beautiful and beautiful, so he takes up the team’s CP; the other is a gay man who lives in daily life. It is difficult to find a partner and intimate relationship that meets their expectations, so they look for male CPs in Japanese dramas to project their emotional needs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to make the topic selection more focused, the interviews of two male CP fans were not included in the analysis. At the beginning of 2023, this paper titled &quot;&quot;CP-eating&quot;: Creative Emotional Experience of Young Female Fans&quot; was published in the &quot;Women&#39;s Studies Series&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It was originally a routine survey, but in October 2023, the paper suddenly became popular. This paper, which is full of words such as &quot;childhood sweetheart&quot; and &quot;soul mate&quot;, was forwarded and liked on social media, attracting attention and ridicule from &quot;addict experts&quot;: &quot;The paper the professor asked me to read is my first name.&quot; No matter how long I put it off, I read the paper on CP addiction with gusto, and even cried while reading it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Search for the keyword &quot;CP&quot; on CNKI and sort by the number of downloads, &quot;&quot;CP&quot;: Creative Emotional Experience of Young Female Fans&quot; ranks first in the relevant literature. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;An interviewer tried to give an answer as to why he is keen on taking CP: &quot;What I expect to see in CP is a kind of spiritual communication and soul resonance.&quot; In real life, marriage is Contracts, contractual relationships, and love are complex luxuries. In a world that is complex and open to multiple interpretations, CP is &quot;a relatively beautiful thing constructed.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/02/IvZpDtwHvl2xSXb2GfD8IBDuhzTTM5Wwh2X6yfJY.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;676&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/02/IvZpDtwHvl2xSXb2GfD8IBDuhzTTM5Wwh2X6yfJY.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256605&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Different CP combinations often appear among the members of idol groups. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;Some emotional needs are not satisfied in reality&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/ h4>; &lt;p>;Xu Guanwen does not take CP and calls himself an &quot;outsider&quot;. His in-depth understanding of CP culture is limited to 55 interviewers. When studying the craze of “eating CP” on the Internet, he paid more attention to the emotional mechanism behind it. When collecting information and designing the interview outline, the question he wanted to discuss with these CP fans was: What is their imagination of this kind of love? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2021, his master&#39;s thesis is about to be started. He was inspired by French sociologist Eva Iroth&#39;s &quot;Love, Why Does It Hurt?&quot; 》Inspired by this, I want to do cultural research on love. Eva Iroth discusses in the book: People are changing partners more and more frequently and faster, and there is a set of changes in emotional concepts behind this. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Xu Guanwen&#39;s view, &quot;romantic love&quot; seems to be imported from China. &quot;During the Republic of China, it was an ideological tool to criticize feudalism and encourage women to escape from the feudal patriarchal system. Lu Xun wrote &quot;What Happened After Nora Left&quot; and found that women did escape from the patriarchal system, but fell into the small family system. In the family, we are still restricted by the male-dominated family concept.&quot; Xu Guanwen told Southern Weekend reporters, &quot;In the 1970s and 1980s, we were exposed to a new round of Western literary and artistic works, such as &quot;Titanic&quot;, and everyone began to accept it again ( Freedom of marriage and love).&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xu Guanwen feels that since the concept of &quot;romantic love&quot; was introduced to China, it has assumed the role of rebelling against the current order, often running counter to economic rational decisions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Following this line of thinking, he decided to include the love concepts of contemporary Chinese youth groups into his research. I looked around, but found that I couldn&#39;t find a suitable research object. By chance, he saw a topic: &quot;I don&#39;t have to fall in love, but my partner must get married.&quot; The most direct question jumped out: Why are they so happy to have a love relationship with their partner? Why do they like to watch others fall in love, but don’t fall in love themselves? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He found his old friend Q as his first interview subject. The two met in a corner of the cafeteria and chatted for three hours in a pleasant atmosphere. The CP circle pays attention to &quot;enclosure and self-admiration&quot;, which refers to entertaining oneself in one&#39;s own small circle. Even if the CPs are the same A and B, if the order is reversed (such as the &quot;AB&quot; party and the &quot;BA&quot; party), it is possible I can&#39;t go together. Q rarely has the opportunity to chat with his peers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The CP that Q drank was a pair of male and female CPs in a certain boy group. Xu Guanwen initially thought that Q&#39;s boyfriend liked childish boys, but after in-depth conversation, he discovered that this was not the case. Q&#39;s boyfriend in real life was burly. The reason why Q likes this couple is that they don&#39;t deliberately maintain a sense of boundaries like adult men, but interact closely like children. &quot;That&#39;s the state of interpersonal interaction that she prefers. It&#39;s simple enough and the emotions are obvious enough.&quot; Xu Guanwen analyzed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;The encounter between a CP fan and CP may be an accident. She chose to learn more about it, possibly because there are certain qualities in CP that attracted her. She got emotional feedback at that moment, Therefore, she is positive and happy at the moment. As she gradually learns more about CP, the underlying things slowly emerge. What really induces this kind of emotional feedback is that certain emotional needs are not met in reality. .&quot; Xu Guanwen told Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, after chasing for several years, the couple finally &quot;be&quot; (bad ending, tragic ending). As the two grew older, Q watched the latest variety shows and found that their interaction became unnatural. &quot;The sense of boundary is very obvious. Even if you don&#39;t realize it, your body&#39;s reaction is very obvious.&quot; Q couldn&#39;t let go of it for a long time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The interviewees had different reasons for taking CP. Some people are frustrated by love in real life and heal their wounds in the relatively ideal and flawless CP world; some people feel stressed in real life and escape to the CP world to vent their emotions. There are also people who have a spectator mentality. In real life, love or marriage always makes people worry about gains and losses, and taking CP can make people objectively look at the emotional direction of a CP couple. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are still times when taking CP is just &quot;interesting&quot;. There are various unexpected combinations of protagonists from characters to actors, from reality to virtuality, from contemporary times to history. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On video websites, Jia Ling was paired up with various male stars and edited into CP videos. Daiyu and Voldemort are also favored by netizens and are paired up as contrasting characters. Xu Guanwen interviewed a girl who was a fan of Voltaire and Rousseau. The outside world often feels that these two people have different opinions and are lifelong enemies. This girl feels that there is room for further interpretation behind the historicized relationship. &quot;The antonym of enemy is friend. Are there other possibilities (for the relationship between the two)? For example, falling in love and killing each other.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms /medias/image/23/11/02/Ibo0RTSbVtuQnLkTBpD8F4EdP3EjktaCh8wRcytR.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;1797&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23 /11/02/Ibo0RTSbVtuQnLkTBpD8F4EdP3EjktaCh8wRcytR.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256606&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The two protagonists of the costume drama &quot;Chen Qing Ling&quot; It has become the target of many fans to &quot;eat CP&quot;. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Information picture/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;You can live without love, but you cannot live without love&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4 >; &lt;p>;When many people take CP, they first feel the impromptu and plump happiness. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xu Guanwen analyzed that behind this kind of immediate happiness, there is not only aesthetic satisfaction, but also the satisfaction of the demand gap of the current emotional state. Of course, some people put their own expectations for intimate relationships into it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;(This expectation) has been very concretely presented in CP. With continuous immersion, the concrete image changes from fuzzy to three-dimensional, so that happiness can continue. Because you can continue to explore , form your own understanding, and experience happiness in the process of exploration.&quot; Xu Guanwen told Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After interviewing 55 CP fans, Xu Guanwen found that the CP emotions that many people actively explore overflow the framework of conventional social life. One of Xu Guanwen&#39;s interviewers drank the CP of two male members of a Korean boy band, but he did not define the intimate relationship between the two as &quot;romantic love&quot;, but the Japanese word &quot;bond&quot;, which expresses a kind of &quot;friend or above&quot;. The emotion of “love is not full”. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The couple grew up together, and were both under 20 years old when the team was formed. This interviewer grew up in a Tongzilou, a group of children who spent their childhood playing around, and shared a similar background to her CP. &quot;She said that she took advantage of this couple because she and her (young) friend were separated by two places and could not meet each other. The kind of family-like connection she expected was seen in CP.&quot; Xu Guanwen said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xu Guanwen paid attention to the comments on social media and found that many people were moved by the interviewer&#39;s words: &quot;You can live without love, but you cannot live without love.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Just like Henry Jenkins As said, the popularity of CP culture itself has a reflection on heterosexual romantic narratives. CP fans are no longer satisfied with the old romantic narratives, but hope to discover unique emotional connections.&quot; Xu Guanwen wrote in the paper . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As a male, Xu Guanwen also discovered some gender differences in his research: when female CP fans romanticize male and female CPs, they often regard holding hands, hugging, etc. as evidence of the intimacy between the two. . Xu Guanwen believes that this is typical female thinking. In fact, boys and girls have different sense of boundaries when expressing closeness to the same sex. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Differentiated emotional models present a complex and complex ecological landscape in the CP world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“You will see that CP culture itself is like a small society, with a very avant-garde side and a very conservative side.” Xu Guanwen told Southern Weekend reporters, “In Danmei CP fan works, maybe There will be some very avant-garde explorations of gender. The conservative side may be that I only consume heterosexual CP and follow the biggest mainstream (society).&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The CP world is like a diverse and diverse world. There is a free emotional market, and whether this market can affect emotional practice in reality, Xu Guanwen&#39;s investigation failed to give an answer. &quot;The reality I face, and how much freedom I have to make my own (emotional) practices, varies from person to person.&quot; Xu Guanwen said, &quot;But in general, it is happy first.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p >;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 03 Nov 2023 09:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[“刘忠林”案代理律师被控三宗罪，一审获刑16年]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259844]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-03 08:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 11/02/mrRGzBS9fSCrOw1lSmD0jdnd5PFaXElNGDvrONZ2.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1267&quot; height=&quot;742&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/02/mrRGzBS9fSCrOw1lSmD0jdnd5PFaXElNGD vrONZ2. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256790&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The Fengman District Court of Jilin City issued a guilty verdict against Xiu Bao. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(People&#39;s Vision/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xiu Bao, who is well-known in the legal circles of Jilin City, Jilin Province, may not have thought that he would also &quot;cry out injustice&quot; for himself &quot;One day. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;Xiu Bao was the director of a law firm, president of the Jilin Lawyers Association, and vice president of the Jilin Provincial Lawyers Association. He served as a deputy to the provincial People&#39;s Congress and was once selected as a candidate for Touching China. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;It is worth mentioning that Xiubao was still the defender during the retrial of Liu Zhonglin’s case. Liu Zhonglin was sentenced to death with a suspended death sentence for intentional homicide and was imprisoned for 25 years and 3 months. He is the longest-term unjust person who has been detained for the longest period of time in public reports. In April 2018, the Jilin Provincial Higher People&#39;s Court changed the verdict and found Liu Zhonglin not guilty. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Today, Xiubao was found guilty of introducing bribes, offering bribes and fraud in two cases he had represented, and was sentenced to 16 years in prison in the first instance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Unsatisfied with the warranty, he appealed to the Jilin Intermediate Court on July 17, 2023. According to Southern Weekend reporters, the warranty repair case file was returned from the Jilin City Procuratorate to the Jilin City Intermediate Court on September 18, 2023. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the relevant provisions of the Criminal Procedure Law, the second instance court should promptly notify the procuratorate to review the case files after deciding to open a trial. The procuratorate shall complete the review within one month. The procuratorate&#39;s review time is not included in the trial period. The people&#39;s court of second instance that accepts appeals and protest cases shall conclude the proceedings within two months. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This means that the trial deadline for this case is November 18, 2023. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Acting bribery case of acting department official was accused of intermediary bribery&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The 68-year-old Xiubao had many auras before he lost his personal freedom. &lt;span>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Public information shows that he has been working as a lawyer since 1988, and later founded Jilin Baomin Law Firm and served as director. Xiubao has won many honors such as &quot;National Advanced Legal Aid Individual&quot; and &quot;National Outstanding Lawyer&quot;. In 2011, he was selected as a candidate for Touching China. In the legal profession of Jilin Province, he is the first deputy to the Provincial People&#39;s Congress. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xiu Bao&#39;s personal deeds have also been frequently reported in newspapers, and he has been called a &quot;civilian lawyer&quot; and &quot;workers&#39; lawyer&quot; by the media. According to People&#39;s Daily Online in 2019, Xiubao has long helped laid-off workers and vulnerable groups safeguard their rights. It has represented more than 400 lawsuits for free in cases involving farmers infected with HIV and other people in need, and has recovered nearly 30,000 laid-off workers and vulnerable groups in accordance with the law. With 200 million yuan in compensation (compensation) and social security pensions, dozens of unjust, false and wrong cases were corrected, and 13 people who were wrongly imprisoned were acquitted, including Liu Zhonglin. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Three years after Liu Zhonglin was released, on January 24, 2022, because he was suspected of committing bribery and bribery, the Huadian City Supervisory Committee, which was managed by Jilin City, took detention measures. He was suspected of committing fraud and was criminally detained by the Panshi City Public Security Bureau of Jilin Province. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The repair and maintenance investigation was related to the bribery case of the first department official of Jilin Province whom we had previously represented. In September 2017, Liu Baowei, chairman of Jilin Provincial Investment Group Co., Ltd. and former secretary of the Tonghua Municipal Party Committee, was investigated. Later, in October 2018, he was prosecuted by the Jilin City Procuratorate on suspicion of accepting bribes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During this period, Xiu Bao served as Liu Baowei&#39;s attorney, and was therefore accused of introducing bribes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The first-instance judgment of the Fengman District Court of Jilin City ([2023] Ji 0211 Xingchu No. 10) shows that the Procuratorate of Fengman District, Jilin City believed that in April 2018, Xiu Bao took advantage of the then deputy director of the Jilin Intermediate People’s Court. Due to his position, Dean Feng Qisheng asked Liu Baowei&#39;s family to contact Feng Qisheng&#39;s wife, Tan Xuemei, and pay a &quot;favor fee&quot; of 600,000 yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the first-instance verdict, Feng Qisheng admitted that when he was the presiding judge of Liu Baowei&#39;s case, he introduced Liu Baowei&#39;s relatives to give Tan Xuemei 600,000 yuan in favors in order to get a lighter sentence. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Feng Qisheng was dismissed from public office in July 2022 due to serious violations of discipline and law. His suspected criminal issues were transferred to the procuratorate for review and prosecution in accordance with the law. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporters learned from relevant parties that Feng Qisheng was sentenced to 11 years in prison by the Dongchang District Court of Tonghua City in December 2022. His wife Tan Xuemei took 5.93 million in bribes and was sentenced to 3 years in prison with a 4-year suspended sentence by the Fengman District Court in Jilin City. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the case of Feng and Tan, Xiu Bao was also implicated. On December 29, 2022, the Procuratorate of Fengman District, Jilin City filed a public prosecution against Xiubao. After the Jilin City Intermediate Court designated jurisdiction, the Fengman District Court opened the case and accepted it on January 11, 2023, and a public hearing was held on March 30 of the same year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On July 6, 2023, the Fengman District Court made a first-instance judgment, and Xiubao’s behavior in this case was found to be the crime of bribery and the crime of introduction of bribery. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the repair party insisted that it was not guilty. Xiu Bao&#39;s attorney believes that the evidence in the case cannot confirm that Liu Baowei&#39;s family paid a bribe of 600,000 yuan to Tan Xuemei. Xiu Bao has no motive for bribery and has no request for Tan Xuemei, which does not meet the standard of proof for conviction. Xiu Bao&#39;s son Xiu Zhiyu said that Xiu Bao and Feng Qisheng often argued about cases in public and were not familiar with each other in private, &quot;and Tan Xuemei is also a practicing lawyer.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;The crime of fraud in &quot;the money is scattered and people return&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In the first instance judgment, Xiubao was also found guilty of fraud. Related to a corruption and bribery case. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Procuratorate of Fengman District, Jilin City believes that from January to June 2019, Xiu Bao was entrusted by Luo to serve as the defender for her husband Yao Moulin&#39;s suspected corruption case, and Xiu Bao fabricated the need for Yao Moulin to be sentenced to probation.向司法机关办案人员支付好处费的事实，随后罗某向其朋友曹某转账，后曹某分3次当面向修保交付现金160万元。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;据一审判决书，丰满区法院认为，修保在吉林市看守所会见姚某林时，让他写一张纸条给罗某，内容是告诉罗某“别心疼钱，钱是给法检办案人员的好处”，纸条上写明“钱散人归”，“到了该花钱的时间了，估计可能要花200（万）-400（万），具体情况你们定”。后修保找到曹某，谎称要疏通关系让罗某拿钱。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但审理姚某林贪污案的审判长和审判员均作证，在姚某林案中，修保并没有向法院办案人员行贿，对姚某林的定罪量刑符合法律法规。修保也在供述中承认自己在姚某林案中收了90万元的律师代理费，但否认编造疏通关系的理由来收取罗某160万元。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但在曹某的证言中，曹某表示，罗某先后向自己汇款160 万元后，他又先后向自己的司机汇款130万元，取现后连同手里的30万元交给修保。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;丰满区法院认为，修保以非法占有为目的，虚构能通过疏通关系让姚某林的犯罪得到从轻处罚的事实，骗取被害人罗某财物,数额特别巨大之行为，构成诈骗罪。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;修保的辩护律师认为，在案证据无法证明修保取得160万元的事实，修保不存在虚构事实行为，不存在隐瞒真相行为。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“其次，就算他收了这160万元，顶多属于违反律师职业道德，修保在接受委托后，作为律师会见、阅卷和开庭等工作都完成了，并且委托人对于案件结果也很满意，所以不构成诈骗罪。”修保的辩护律师告诉南方周末记者。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;此外，据其子修志玉了解，姚某林和罗某也未向修保追讨这160万元，亦未向公安机关报案。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;最终，法院判处修保犯诈骗罪，判处有期徒刑十二年，并处罚金人民币20万元。此外，法院还以修保犯行贿罪，判处有期徒刑三年，并处罚金人民币20万元；犯介绍贿赂罪，判处有期徒刑二年，并处罚金人民币10万元；决定执行有期徒刑十六年，并处罚金人民币50元。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;一审宣判后，修保向吉林市中院提出上诉，目前，案件已进入二审程序。 2023年11月1日，南方周末记者就该案二审是否开庭审理多次联系吉林市中院，未获回复。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;修志玉表示，希望二审能开庭审理，“只要判决结果是公开公正的，并且大家了解案情后都觉得我父亲罪有应得的话，我想他也会释怀”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 03 Nov 2023 08:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[“纳卡”再得一分、强力介入中东：埃尔多安玩转地缘政治棋局]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259773]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-02 23:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;近期，世界局势愈发动荡不安，各族群之间的文明冲突、地区冲突日趋激化，世界重回多事之秋。在诸多冲突与动荡之中，土耳其近几年来的一连串作为愈来愈引人注目，埃尔多安总统以一系列令人眼花缭乱的组合拳，为自己赢得了“埃苏丹”绰号。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;前几年的叙利亚内战，其出兵叙北部，支持亲土武装派系，占领并控制了叙部分领土。在争夺势力范围的过程中，埃尔多安胆大手硬，不仅敢对阿萨德政府军动手，且敢于击落支持叙军的俄军战机和直升机。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2020年“阿-亚战争”，土耳其支持阿塞拜疆，重创了亚美尼亚，再次打击了俄在中东的威信。因此，土在中东世界的地位得到很大提升，许多阿拉伯民众视埃尔多安为民族英雄。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;埃尔多安敢对普京叫板，主要是靠其北约成员国身份。他知道：在这一政治军事集团庇护下，俄罗斯不会为较次要、较小的海外利益而直接进攻土耳其。借助西方的力量，提升自己在伊教族群里的威望，好个借力打力手法。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2022年，俄乌冲突爆发后，土耳其在几方之间来往穿梭、翻云覆雨：一方面，其参与促成了“黑海粮食通道”协商，提升了自己在北约成员国中的地位。另一方面，又利用在北约的否决权，迟滞芬兰、瑞典加入北约的申请。这进一步提高了自己在中东的地位，在民众看来：埃尔多安是既敢对俄罗斯说不，又敢对美国和欧洲说不的当世英雄、不二豪杰，简直就是萨拉丁再世。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这使土耳其在与沙特、伊朗争执中东之牛耳的角逐中，增分不少。原本，由于奥斯曼帝国垮塌，土耳其人属突厥种群而非阿拉伯族群，凯末尔主义在过去几十年执行的亲西方路线等诸多因素，土耳其在中东世界中曾被边缘化，现在终于被“埃苏丹”扳回不少比分。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2023年，土耳其在外高加索地区再下一局：支持阿塞拜疆，迫使亚美尼亚撤出“纳卡地区”。这不但是土耳其和阿塞拜疆取得了地缘争端胜利，而且使亚美尼亚出于自身存亡考虑，脱离了曾依靠上百年的故主俄罗斯。此举使俄罗斯在外高加索的地缘政治冲突中失分严重。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在为难芬兰和瑞典近一年，达到了自己的政治目的（芬、瑞同意减弱对反土的库尔德势力支持）后，土耳其批准了芬兰和瑞典加入北约的申请，又提升了自己在北约中的影响力，并改善了与美国的关系。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2023年10月，随着加沙地带爆发“哈以冲突”，埃尔多安站出来抨击以色列，并批评美国和欧洲，再次赢得了中东世界对他的广泛支持。他真的要复兴奥斯曼土耳其帝国吗？他又是如何在几年里连续多次获胜的？这要从土耳其的政治利益、文化定位、地缘战略说起。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;土耳其的国防安全，要靠以美国为主的北约，其经济基础，主要靠欧盟为主的欧洲市场。在现代世界，根本不可能允许土耳其用武力夺回前奥斯曼帝国的故土。因此“凯末尔主义”的世俗化和亲西方化理念的主体未变，埃尔多安多年努力，始终是希望加入欧盟，当被媒体问及其究竟是走向西方还是东方，他坚定地回答：走向西方，加入欧盟。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;土耳其在文化上又是与西方存在较大冲突的国家。作为政治家，埃尔多安必须基于现实社会基础来决定自己的施政方针。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在“凯末尔主义”践行的最初几十年，土耳其采取了对西方一边倒策略。但最近十几年来，随着伊斯兰世界力量增强，安卡拉当局当然不能放弃这个巨大资源，所以，其必定要争取伊斯兰世界的领导地位。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在地缘战略层面，土耳其拥有得天独厚的优势：作为北约东南方向的战略支柱，不但卡死了黑海出入口，且能影响黑海沿岸和里海地区的安全态势。外高加索和中亚地区，始终是俄罗斯的战略软腹部，而无论是在地缘方面，还是在族群、宗教、文化、经济等方面，土耳其对这两个地区的影响都较深远。虎踞安纳托利亚高原的土耳其，其向西接壤东南欧，向东临近伊朗，向南虎视美索不达米亚的两河流域，举手投足举足轻重。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;如今，埃尔多安综合利用了政治、宗教、文化、经济、军事、地缘等多种因素，合纵连横、转闪腾挪，取得了不少成功，扩展了土耳其的地缘政治利益。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但在这套看似风头正盛的作为背后，土耳其却存在着严重问题：他们的经济体量，难以支撑“埃苏丹”的雄才大略。其通货膨胀非常严重，土耳其央行10月26日宣布，将基准利率从30%上调500个基点至35%，这已经是土央行6月进入加息周期后连续第五次加息。2022年以来，土耳其通胀率一直高位运行，2022年10月达85.51%，2023年7、8、9三个月分别为47.83%、58.94%、61.53%，且仍有上行趋势。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;很显然，“埃苏丹”以土耳其的中等规模国家体量，干了太多赔本赚吆喝的政绩，成本全得由民众来承担。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在历史上，很多国家，都采取煽动民族主义、玩弄顶层权谋、透支国力的策略，在较短时间内取得了令人瞠目结舌的成就，但结果多为悲剧。这道理很简单：就像身体不太好之人，非要透支体力去跑马拉松、铁人三项、十项全能，当然不会有啥好结果。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;目前，埃尔多安在尽力控制游戏节奏，在达到自己目的后，或会向美国和欧洲妥协。譬如：最终批准芬兰和瑞典加入北约，美军（为维护自身与库尔德族群达成的利益）击落土军无人机，他选择了低调处理。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;毕竟，在国防方面，土耳其要依靠美国；在经济方面，那么高的通胀率，更要依靠欧盟的帮助，且其在欧洲有大量移民和务工人员，这对安卡拉的经济非常重要，同时也是土耳其对欧洲进行族群渗透拓殖、文化扩张的长期手段。因此，无论是做戏、做秀，还是争端、冲突，都得适可而止，不能与西方彻底闹翻。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;所以，埃尔多安以土耳其之国力与影响力，玩弄着中等规模的地缘战略游戏。他的意图是：利用自己地跨欧-亚两洲、政治与文化涉及欧洲-伊教两个阵营，在几只船上跳来跳去，以扩大土耳其在现代欧洲地区、伊斯兰世界中的影响。&lt;/p>;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;要知道，每年的11月份，都是南极旅游季开启的时候。国内不少旅行社纷纷开卖南极之旅项目，一趟旅行下来价格基本都要10万元以上，一些高端一点的线路可以高达三四十万元。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;一直以来，南极之旅都是小众高端项目，很多人对此并不了解，不少人也是第一次听说竟然还可以去南极旅游。去南极旅游又难又贵？南极游究竟是花钱欣赏独一无二的美景，还是“花钱买罪受”？很多人去南极旅游，是否会破坏南极的生态环境？&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/31/Ry46lJqqtjt2vMlY9w62dFLPyCkmUXDliLD7DCL3.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/31/Ry46lJqqtjt2vMlY9w62dFLPyCkmUXDliLD7DCL3.jpeg&quot;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;南极在地球的最南端，是地球上最后一个被发现，也是唯一没有人类生存定居的大陆。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;在过去很长一段时间，南极都是世界上的神秘之地，直到1820年南极洲被发现。此后南极也主要作为科研基地，1911年12月挪威阿蒙森探险队首次到达南极极点，1985年我国首次在南极洲建立了科研考察站。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;事实上，南极也是旅游目的地。上世纪50年代，世界上第一批由500人组成的国际游客团前往南极，南极旅游正式出现。2007年是中国开启南极游的旅游元年，中国第一条官方认可的南极游线路成行。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;据国际南极旅游业者协会(IAATO)统计，中国是登陆南极旅游的第二大客源国。在2017-2018南极旅游季，全球共计有51707名游客到访南极，中国游客人数达到8273人，占比达16%，仅次于美国。2022-23南极季总共1464人次中国人去了南极，预计2023-24南极旅游季，中国游客会恢复到疫情前的80%。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;南极没有四季，只有两季，分别是暖季（11月—3月）和寒季（4月—10月）。暖季也是南极的旅游季，因为几乎都是白天，气温也较高，更适合旅游。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;从理论上说，只要是南极的旅游季，每个人都可以去南极旅行，因为去南极旅游不需要签证，南极不属于任何一个国家。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;从实际操作上来看，去南极旅游很难，毕竟我国并没有直达南极的商业航班，游客必须先去往距离南极比较近的国家，比如阿根廷、澳大利亚或新西兰，再经由这些中转国的邮轮或航班去往南极。所以，去南极要办中转国的签证，也需要专业的旅游公司提供帮助与服务。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/31/bcdfUdi8XYsJEq5ytx0qk74142tITCWOEmb4Y18g.jpeg&quot;

&lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（IC photo/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;欣赏美，或买罪受？&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;可以想见，南极有着摄人心魄的美。南极大陆98%的地域终年为冰雪所覆盖，让人仿佛置身纯白的世界，从眼睛到心灵都无比澄澈透亮。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;在这里，游客会因大自然的鬼斧神工而颤栗，可以欣赏到永昼的自然景观，也可以与南极洲的主人们——企鹅、蓝鲸、海狮以及各种海鸥，和谐愉快地共处……&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;南极游可以给我们提供在世界上其他地方感受不到的独家体验。为了丰富旅途的乐趣，旅游公司也会在南极开展徒步、皮划艇和露营等户外活动。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;去南极欣赏美的背后，也需要支付很高的成本。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;漫长的旅程背后，是金钱消逝的声音。如今国内主流的南极游项目都是先从国内飞往阿根廷，再经由阿根廷坐邮轮去往南极，大部分邮轮的始发地都在阿根廷最南端的乌斯怀亚。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;从国内到阿根廷布宜诺斯艾利斯飞行全程约40小时（还得承受麻烦的转机），从阿根廷港口搭乘邮轮出海，要经历2天到5天不等的航行时间，方可抵达南极大陆。游客可以选择只在南极大陆玩几天；也可以选择“南极半岛+南极圈”，在南极半岛的基础上再向南航行一段穿过南极圈。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;一趟南极游下来，短的话十天左右，长的话可以二三十天。根据飞机舱位的不同、邮轮等级与住宿环境的不同，价格上也有很大的差异。比如各家邮轮公司的价格基本在每人60000—200000元人民币。由此，一趟南极游的总费用，便宜的要七八万，昂贵的要三四十万，甚至更高。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;南极游的挑战不仅仅在于价格贵，也在于旅途中很“受罪”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;抵达南极大陆的邮轮，基本上都要穿越德雷克海峡。这是世界上最宽的海峡，也是世界上最深的海峡，由于受极地旋风的影响，常年狂风巨浪，一年到头风力基本都在8级以上。邮轮穿越其间，船体不可避免要发生剧烈晃动，游客晕船+呕吐的发生概率极高，以至于有这样的说法，“没晕过一回德雷克海峡, 别说你去过南极”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;南极游的游客，对于这段旅程往往也就存在两极分化的评价。有的认为不虚此行，是人生中独一无二的经验，也有些人坦诚道，花钱买罪受，南极游“好冷、好远、好贵、好无聊”。&lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;旅游会伤害南极吗&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;南极是世界公认的全人类共有的自然保护区，对于南极的保护也早就以国际公约的形式确定下来。1959年12月1日，《南极条约》签订，1961年6月23日正式生效。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;《南极公约》旨在约束各国在南极洲这块地球上唯一一块没有常住人口的大陆上的活动，确保各国对南极洲的尊重。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;1991年，南极条约协商国特别会议针对南极的环境保护，通过了《关于环境保护的南极条约议定书》。中国作为协商国之一，签署了议定书。议定书为保护南极大陆及附近地区的生态环境免遭破坏制定了严格的保护措施。之后，国际南极旅游业者协会还出台了《南极旅游从业者活动指南》及《南极游客活动指南》。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;在这些条约的约束下，如今去南极旅游必须恪守一些原则，比如大船在某个地方停留不能超过5个小时；每次岛上只能登陆100人；不能主动靠近企鹅5米范围内；下船登陆、游玩返回上船都要清理鞋子，以避免生物侵袭，等等。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;只不过，气候灾难已经对南极生态产生严重的影响。随着地球的升温，南极冰川正在融化，也变得更加脆弱。研究表明，从1997年至2021年，逾四成南极洲冰架显著缩小。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;如今人类频繁的旅游活动，或让南极的雪化更快了。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;去年，《自然-通讯》（Nature Communications）上发表的一篇论文指出，南极洲的游客抵达点的黑碳污染，可能会增加这些地区的融雪。化石燃料和生物质燃料燃烧会产生黑碳，这些黑碳会吸收光线，让大气升温。如果黑碳落在雪上，融雪便会加快。于是，环境保护者大声疾呼：请减少非必要的南极游，请保护自然生态。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;尴尬的是，国内不少推出南极游项目的公司，宣传南极游的理由之一是，“部分南极冰川正在加速融化，失去了原貌的自然美。越早去，难能看到最原始的南极大陆，挽留即将消失的美丽与原始！”可恰恰越来越多游客的到访，在加剧南极冰雪的融化，在破坏南极的美。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;这倒不是说要把南极游都取消掉，人与自然是可以和谐共处的。只是，确实有必要加快清洁能源在南极游过程中的使用，限制游客数量，加强对南极旅游的监管，强化南极条约等的落实，从而尽可能减少人类在南极活动对南极生态的负面影响。&lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;从目前事态来看，如果等不到“白马骑士”，一旦威马汽车彻底破产，十余万车主将面临车机系统“彻底停机”的厄运。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;电动汽车的主要部件从此前燃油车的发动机、变速箱变成了以三电系统等为主，在电动汽车维修市场中，新能源汽车相关产品技术、配件供应都掌握在主机厂和三电厂商手里，独立维修商很少参与。如此意味着，当威马等电动车企因市场竞争激烈等因素被淘汰出局，会造成售后服务断链，车主在市场上也无法找到相应的替代品。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一位威马车主的遭遇就是典型例子。他所购买的威马EX5汽车动力电池出现故障，充电到80%时会自动跳电到100%，用电到剩余20%时车子直接就不能动了。因为还在厂家质保期内，该车主把车开到济南威马用户中心匡山店维修，近半年时间仍然没有修好，原因是厂家不给提供配件。车主又联系了4S店，4S店说没法儿经营下去了，让其把车拖走，自行解决。该车主也多次向厂家投诉，却迟迟不能解决。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;威马汽车车主面临“售后难”，暴露出电动汽车并不如车主想象的那么美。因政策大力扶持，中国电动汽车产业发展速度较快，公安部发布的最新统计数据显示，目前中国电动汽车保有量已超1800万辆。但电动汽车飞速狂奔之下，仍然存在六大风险，除了上述威马车主遭遇的困境之外，还涉及续航里程、充电、用车安全、数据及隐私、辅助驾驶等方面，车主买车时不可不察。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;部分电动汽车厂家为了促销，故意夸大车辆的续航里程。据《华夏时报》今年3月报道，多数新能源汽车4S店标注的都是NEDC综合工况（驾驶循环测试）续航里程，并未标注实际续航。网约车司机刘先生对《华夏时报》记者表示，他在2022年5月份提的一款电动汽车，当时标注的续航是505公里，但在实际驾驶中，不论是跑高速还是在市区行驶，续航里程始终只能达到300公里左右，并且到了冬天只有200多公里，有一次还在高速上“趴了窝”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;续航里程名不副实外，电动汽车的充电速度较慢，往往需要六到八小时才能充满。这在很大程度上影响了消费者的使用体验。特别是在急需用车的情况下，长时间的充电时间会让消费者感到非常不便。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;对此，电动车企提供了两种方案。其一是直流快充模式，用时为1到1.5小时。但快充模式频繁使用，会对电池寿命造成影响。因此，当前电动汽车仍以交流慢充为主。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;其二，某些车企提供了换电模式，但车主所需承担的费用高，同时，换电站投资成本高，已建数量有限。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;电动汽车的安全性是消费者关切的另一大痛点。近年来，已有多起电动汽车自燃的事故发生，给车主的生命财产安全带来了严重威胁。应急管理部门统计的数据显示，仅2023年第一季度，电动汽车自燃率就上涨了32%，平均每天就有8辆电动汽车发生火灾（含自燃）。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;电动汽车智能化的方向之一是数据化，电动汽车不仅能通过车内镜头收录车主的人脸数据，还可能对车主居住场所、行踪及消费场所等信息也加以收录，一旦此类数据被车企泄露或黑客盗取，则会造成更严重的后果。根据美国缅因州总检察长办公室今年8月发布的通知，特斯拉公司在5月份发生的数据泄露事件影响了逾7.5万人，其中包括与员工相关的记录，这起事件源自“内部员工的不当行为”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;电动汽车对辅助驾驶技术的应用，会带来更多的问题。一些车企将辅助驾驶技术称为“辅助自动驾驶”或“自动辅助驾驶”，销售人员在推销时将其吹得天花乱坠，美化为“自动驾驶”，真出事故了，就成“辅助驾驶”了。当前不少电动车其所使用的辅助驾驶技术本身就存在悖论，既倡导解放驾驶员，又要求驾驶员随时随地监督与准备接管。如果发生事故，驾驶者、车企两者责任如何切分？&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;电动汽车存在的六大风险，有些随着技术进步或许能得到改善，有些则可能在很长时间内都无解，因此，人们购买电动汽车，不能对车企所宣传的“环保”（电池所造成的环境污染程度不低）、“智能化”全盘接受，还是要理性客观评估，再决定是否下单。&lt;/p>;

The purpose of cancellation and adjustment is to effectively reduce the burden on enterprises and the people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;取消和调整的罚款事项共涉及7部行政法规和6部部门规章。 The &quot;Decision&quot; puts forward clear requirements for the legislative work after the cancellation and adjustment of fines. Relevant departments of the State Council must submit relevant administrative regulations modification plans to the State Council within 60 days from the date of issuance of the &quot;Decision&quot; and complete the modification and abolition of relevant departmental regulations. If departmental regulations need to be adjusted according to the revised administrative regulations, the modification and abolition must be completed within 60 days from the date of promulgation of the relevant administrative regulations.

Hundreds of people filed in, lingering in the classrooms, student dormitories, book bars, and running tracks of this rural school, observing carefully, even the bathrooms painted with paint. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Visitors include principals, moral education directors, classroom teachers from all over the country, officials and entrepreneurs from the local education sector, social organizations engaged in family education and private innovative education, as well as some who “can’t figure it out” in their own families. Parents worried about their children. They were curious about how a school called &quot;Ugly Duckling Middle School&quot; could help a group of children who seemed to be surly, tired of studying, or even suffering from deep depression to blossom into a natural and brilliant life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For these questions, the &quot;ugly duckling&quot; principal Zhan Danian always smiles and does not answer immediately. In the 13 years since he founded this school, various questions and controversies have continued, which he no longer thinks is strange. But he did not expect that the youth depression problem that he had deeply realized in running the school would actually trigger a strong response after launching the &quot;First Youth Psychological Safety Forum&quot; (jointly with the China Education Thirty Forum), and the reverberation continues to this day. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;2023 China Mental Health&quot; Blue Book released on October 10, 2023 shows that 40% of Chinese teenagers feel lonely, the depression detection rate among high school students is 40%, and the depression detection rate among junior high school students is 40%. is 50%, and the risk of mild anxiety among college students is 38%. Peng Kaiping, dean of the Academy of Social Sciences of Tsinghua University, once wrote an article pointing out that today&#39;s Chinese teenagers have &quot;four no&#39;s&quot;: no interest in learning, no interest in the real world, no ability to deal with the real society, and no interest in life. Therefore, the theme of this forum has been upgraded from the previously mentioned &quot;youth mental health&quot; to &quot;psychological safety&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/BcDl53HOeKhBlcjWZsACyCKlrhO9mJTFm3q4LvX9.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;546&quot; height= &quot;364&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/BcDl53HOeKhBlcjWZsACyCKlrhO9mJTFm3q4LvX9.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256482&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In the psychology room of Ugly Duckling Middle School, teacher Li Guihong (middle) performs sand table psychotherapy for students.

The best and most equitable education should be education that adapts to students&#39; personalities, so that every student&#39;s potential can be developed.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We have actually heard this argument too many times. The key is how to put it into practice. Therefore, in the &quot;wild education&quot; of the &quot;ugly duckling&quot;, is there really any experience that can be discovered and learned from to prevent and treat depression in teenagers? What kind of social and family symptoms are behind every depressed child? Are they definitely unsolvable? Our reporters went to Kunming and Yiliang to explore the possibility of dispelling the shadow of education under the sun. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/cnGVQpHqsTRAN5BW8PNj5Om1pOjzY81isic8ZjO9.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;545&quot; height= &quot;364&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/cnGVQpHqsTRAN5BW8PNj5Om1pOjzY81isic8ZjO9.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256483&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;At 11:30 in the morning, the students of Ugly Duckling Middle School were having physical education class.

But in the crowd, with her dark face, ponytail, and big black-rimmed glasses, she didn&#39;t often make a sound. On a 30℃ day, my body is still huddled in a collared sweater and a jacket. When you open your mouth, the sound coming out of the braces is very soft, like a porcelain bowl that is afraid of breaking. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I noticed her in class. In the Chinese class of teacher Juanjuan in the second grade of junior high school, Pu Pu raised her hand, which surprised me, who initially thought she would not want to speak. But two minutes later, she lowered her head and body, and closed her eyes, as if everything around her had nothing to do with her. This state of affairs occurs constantly in the classroom. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;It&#39;s a reaction after taking medicine.&quot; Psychology teacher Li Guihong told me. When he first arrived at &quot;The Ugly Duckling&quot;, Pu Pu had to take more than 20 pills of medication to treat mental illness at a time, but now the medication has been reduced by more than half. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;More than two years ago, Pu Pu was in the first grade of junior high school in Kunming, a middle school known for its academic performance. Like other branches of this education group, almost nothing is allowed here that is not related to study. It is strictly forbidden to move or talk during meals and lunch breaks. If you are &quot;disobedient&quot;, the dormitory aunt will record your name, deduct points, and scold you. Pu Pu once had his name recorded because he took a few minutes longer to take a shower. He got a little excited while chatting with his classmates at noon, so he was also recorded. &quot;The punishment is a slap on the palm, but it doesn&#39;t hurt. There is also running, which requires many laps.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Don&#39;t you think this kind of management is a bit strict?&quot; I asked her. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;It doesn&#39;t count. I broke the rules in the first place, and it&#39;s all my fault.&quot; She answered quietly in the rest area next to the &quot;Ugly Duckling&quot; playground. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After reading for a while, Pu Pu began to suffer from insomnia and developed delusional symptoms. &quot;Sometimes I feel happy, and sometimes I feel uncomfortable. When I feel uncomfortable, I can&#39;t control myself and scream loudly.&quot; She asked her parents to see a psychiatrist. Later, she was diagnosed with &quot;depression and anxiety disorder&quot; and was admitted to the hospital. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Pu Pu’s parents run a dental clinic and are very caring towards her. &quot;During the time I was hospitalized, my father was at work and my mother often stayed with me in the hospital.&quot; She had undergone MECT (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 毷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;non-convulsive electroshock&lt;/span>; ) and transcranial magnetism (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;physical device that stimulates brain nerves&lt;/span>;) treatments, except for dizziness and numbness, did not have much effect. Pu Pu dropped out of school. In the past two years, she gained weight due to medication and other reasons. Her heaviest weight was close to 70 kilograms. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/TJoN8oef5Juq9tWKgF4rQvSNw2dkpGJCEAFagyfE.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;449&quot; height= &quot;337&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/TJoN8oef5Juq9tWKgF4rQvSNw2dkpGJCEAFagyfE.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256485&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Aerial view of the Ugly Duckling Middle School campus&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern People Weekly reporter Weng Huan/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p >;Bad moods still came up from time to time like a tide. When she couldn&#39;t stand it anymore, Pu Pu would hit her head against the wall, cry, and pinch her throat with her hands... More than once, she wanted to open the window and jump. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are other ways. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Rolling up her sleeves, Pu Pu’s arms, from palm to elbow, were densely covered with new flesh that was a minute or two thicker than the original skin after twenty or thirty cuts with a knife, like a row. Light-colored thorns winding up. There are several more in the middle, which are longer, deeper, and redder in color. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Does it hurt when you paddle?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;No.&quot; She shook her head and smiled. &quot;Seeing blood relieves stress.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In those late nights when she couldn&#39;t get through it, patients she met while she was in the hospital sent her messages and asked her to try other methods, such as scratching paper, throwing stuffed toys, and picking at the wall. &quot;They also advised me not to think about (suicide) so much. Some (symptoms) are milder than yours, and some are more severe than yours. You will definitely get better slowly.&quot; After hearing these kind words of comfort, Pu Pu would stop. &quot;I actually don&#39;t believe what they said. But when I think about how hard it was for my parents to give birth to and raise me, I can&#39;t just give up.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;You still think that suffering from mental illness is all a matter of Is it my own problem?&quot; I asked her again. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Well... I didn&#39;t adjust my mentality well. I used to have low self-esteem. I didn&#39;t like my skin being so dark. It turned out that my classmates at school called me &#39;black girl&#39;. I was unhappy and also I keep it in my heart.&quot; She raised her head and opened her eyes: &quot;But I am optimistic now. I don&#39;t think there is any problem with being black. And my mother said that there are many medical beauty methods now. If I want, I can also have whitening when I grow up. .&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A year ago, Pu Pu was sent as an &quot;ugly duckling&quot;. &quot;She didn&#39;t like to laugh very much and couldn&#39;t integrate into the group.&quot; During the &quot;attack&quot;, she trembled all over and pulled her hair, causing two people to suffer. Only then can she be held back. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Both Zhan Danian and Li Guihong said that adults need to pay attention to children&#39;s paddling and &quot;self-injury&quot;, but do not need to be too frightened. &quot;Some are seeking stimulation, some are subconscious, and some are emotional releases. They may want you to see it. What you have to do is to give them enough understanding and protection.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For various physical symptoms and stress In response, Li Guihong recorded her experience in the industry for more than ten years in a notebook, as well as some practices she learned from Liu Zhiyou, a special psychological consultant for &quot;The Ugly Duckling&quot; and a Taiwanese brain science expert: when dealing with children with trembling hands and feet, first touch them gently. If they have violent behaviors such as hitting the wall, you can give them electrolyte water and touch other parts of the body. After the child calmed down a little, she also taught the student the &quot;Flat Throwing Kung Fu&quot;: half-squatting, slowly shaking both hands up and down. Sometimes she would also give the children some lemon slices, &quot;I said eating this will make them feel better quickly, and psychological suggestions can also work.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images. infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/CpuvdptotWQHlYpaDKBAVn7smjmQGGQ6cJciqfkk.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;441&quot; height=&quot;294&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/ medias/image/23/11/01/CpuvdptotWQHlYpaDKBAVn7smjmQGGQ6cJciqfkk.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256484&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Ugly Duckling Middle School Boys Dormitory&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern People Weekly reporter Weng Huan/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During class time and after class in the afternoon, students will always enter the first floor in twos and threes. This psych room on the left. They hugged the big furry bears on the sofas and cushions; some would chat with &quot;Lao Li&quot; - this is their pet name for Li Guihong; some spent half an hour drawing mandoles in the cubicle. Luo (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;A painting therapy invented by psychologist Jung&lt;/span>;). &quot;Old Li, why haven&#39;t my paintings been hung up?&quot; A child said, half coquettishly and half angrily. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;How about you draw a more interesting one? I will consider it later.&quot; Li Guihong secretly told me, asking whether this child is a student specializing in art. &quot;I have to give other children more opportunities.&quot; I suddenly remembered that when I visited the girls&#39; dormitory on the first day, there were several girls on the upper bunk with their legs curled up and their heads raised, painting, and one of them was Pu Pu. In the &quot;Ugly Duckling&quot;, all greening and interior and exterior decorations are completed by students according to their own wishes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;No one seems to regard this psychological room with warm colors as a therapeutic place. It has naturally become a transfer station, chat room and tea room for emotional flow. &quot;They are willing to come here for no particular purpose. They can relax and clear their minds. That&#39;s good.&quot; Li Guihong said. When encountering a child like Pu Pu who needs special treatment, if she is willing to chat, she and her colleague Yang Haoming will divide the work; if not, the first thing to do is still: give time and wait. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Only when the child&#39;s emotions are relatively intense and several people have &#39;attacks&#39; at the same time, I feel a little powerless.&quot; She smiled, &quot;But there are other teachers who can take turns to deal with it, so don&#39;t be afraid.&quot;&lt;/p>; p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/vMJ3G8t4amWuAREHAtZnY6sTReZXiQLvcCYK1bfb.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;441&quot; height=&quot;297 &quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/vMJ3G8t4amWuAREHAtZnY6sTReZXiQLvcCYK1bfb.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256488&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: # 999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Students are reading beside the bookshelf at the entrance of the classroom.

She is recovering well now.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When some children first arrived, they were arrogant and said, &quot;Thinking that everything is other people&#39;s.&quot; It’s their fault. They often feel excluded and isolated from the entire world, and tend to avoid social interactions.” Some of these students may have already constructed or are forming their own worldview and set of behavioral logic. They are like big rocks on the cliff, shining brightly, but also easy to fall, and need the support of the big trees on the cliff. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tian Lan is one of them. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hearing that I wanted to chat with him in the military training class, Tian Lam’s eyes lit up as he shuffled slowly: “YES!” Later I learned that as long as there was no class, he would secretly happy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Entering the large conference room on the first floor, only the two of us were left. Tian Lan sat down in an almost &quot;Ge You lying&quot; posture without any restraint. When faced with many questions, he would pause for five or six seconds before slowly spitting out his answer. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When the topic involved emotions and &quot;depression&quot;, he seemed to be waking up from a dream, &quot;Then why are you looking for me -&quot; I thought the conversation was about to reach a deadlock, but he said again: &quot; This needs to be traced back all the way...even though I am only 14 years old, it has already run through my short life.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tian Lan grew up in a provincial capital city in the south of the Yangtze River. A year or two before coming to the &quot;Ugly Duckling&quot;, he dropped out of school for six months and was stuck at home without ever leaving the house. Watching videos and reading novels. The longest time I stayed awake was more than fifty hours. He originally weighed 140 pounds, but lost dozens of pounds because he only had one meal in a day or two. &quot;It&#39;s not nutritious. Even my nails are only cut once a month.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Unbeknownst to him, he refused to hear any sound at that time. He would explode whenever he heard a sound and would not let his father live at home. &quot;I just drove him away. They say &#39;filial piety comes first&#39;, but I actually beat my parents. I couldn&#39;t help it. After the beating, my mother cried, and I cried with her.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A psychiatrist was also found. Yes, come to see a doctor. Tian Lan didn&#39;t accept any of it. &quot;The questions they asked were very boring, and I couldn&#39;t see anything credible from them.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Day and night are reversed, lifeless. At that time, Tian Lan&#39;s only thought was &quot;stay at home until the age of 18 and then die.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What happened before that? I asked him several times. He frowned and fell into memories, &quot;I can&#39;t tell.&quot; From childhood to junior high school, the memory puzzle was full of cracks. The description of the past is mixed with recognition, resentment, reflection, and more confusion. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tian Lan’s father is a middle-level cadre of a state-owned enterprise, and his mother takes care of him full-time. The relationship with them cannot be said to be very bad, nor can it be said to be very good. When he was about 10 years old, his piano teacher scolded him fiercely because he made a mistake in practicing the piano, &quot;and even threw the milk out.&quot; After passing the level 10 piano test, he said, &quot;I never want to touch this thing again.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Just read it In the first year of junior high school, he was in a well-known foreign language school in the provincial capital, and his classmates seemed to be better than him. &quot;There were only 9 classes in the whole grade at that time, and I was in class 2109. But they said I was in class 10. Everyone was having fun, except me. I suspected that I had a neurological problem. Why can others socialize but I can&#39;t?&quot;&lt; /p>; &lt;p>;Tian Lan longed for a friend, but the result was zero. Then he didn&#39;t want to do his homework anymore. &quot;My mother said you can do whatever you want.&quot; He didn&#39;t go to school for a month. Man, completely wilted. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Half a year after dropping out of school, he entered a local &quot;closed school&quot; under military management (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 毷体, 毷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Special Training School&lt;/p>; span>;). &quot;Yes, it&#39;s like XX Academy.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Strict control is not important. I hate the underworld.&quot; He emphasized. In Tian Lan’s description, the school is very popular (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 毷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Two sounds, meaning deceitful&lt;/span>;), &quot;teachers, gangsters&quot; They all bully others and hit them wherever they want. The boys&#39; class doesn&#39;t treat others as human beings. There are surveillance cameras everywhere just for parents to see. Even if they wipe their noses during assembly, they can be pulled to the stairwell.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When I first arrived at the closed school, my limb functions deteriorated a bit because I stayed at home for too long: my fingers were weak and my eyes couldn’t focus. After a few periods of military class, he heard two &quot;clicks&quot; from his knees and fell to the playground. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After five days like this, the instructor and classmates thought he was faking. &quot;I went to the village hospital to take a picture. I fractured my knee, and the doctor took a picture of my calf!&quot; He said with a &quot;bewildered&quot; expression. When he went to see the doctor for a follow-up visit, there were many teachers beside the car taking him to the hospital, but no one helped him pull the wheelchair or push him into the car. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;The whole world is sick. I am also sick.&quot; He smiled habitually. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;How could you stay in such an environment for 8 months? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I later learned to tolerate it. Not long after I arrived, I complained to my dad and begged him to take me away. He just smiled. But you know, I have been in a closed school for a long time. , I even feel a little warm! I have found a little feeling of home.&quot; He himself couldn&#39;t believe this mentality. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before and after the school was closed, he attended several other schools. Tian Lan was amazed at &quot;How come the world has become so weird in just over a year&quot;: &quot;Some schools are eager to learn all the contents of junior high school as soon as they are promoted from primary school to junior high school. Some even don&#39;t have enough time to go to the toilet and don&#39;t understand. Every day before the exam They all talked about test papers. Didn’t my mother tell the teacher at the new school that I had a fracture? The frostbite pustules on my hands left in the closed school have not gone away for a year. The teacher asked, didn’t you have a fracture? You were resting at home, so what are you doing? Will there be frostbite?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This heart is not completely dead. What Tian Lan wants to learn most is Go. His best result is amateur fifth-dan: it is no exaggeration to say that 99% of ordinary people are no longer his opponents in Go. &quot;You don&#39;t have to think about sixth-dan. I will be among the top three in provincial and municipal competitions. I think I have some talent. But what&#39;s the use of passing the exam?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images .infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/yb5knYK1H5M5xPYAGDUsjuZwJWyvrG62KRQXEuVY.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;443&quot; height=&quot;297&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms /medias/image/23/11/01/yb5knYK1H5M5xPYAGDUsjuZwJWyvrG62KRQXEuVY.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256487&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Students decorate with brushes Girls dormitory &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern People Weekly reporter Weng Huan/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He liked Liu Cixin and listened to &quot;The Three-Body Problem&quot; using podcast software when he dropped out of school , and love to read &quot;Supernova Era&quot; and many other short stories. &quot;Have you ever heard of &quot;Genshin Impact&quot; (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 毷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;an open world role-playing game&lt;/span>;)?

My uncle and aunt were very strict with my cousin, but during the COVID-19 epidemic, the two brothers still had fun in the countryside of their hometown. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“The house in my hometown is big, with a mountain behind it. The top of the mountain was cut in half, and a slope protruded from the cliff. We cut down the weeds, built steps, and dug many holes. After the grass grew, we repaired it ourselves.

That&#39;s our &#39;Hundred Garden&#39;.&quot; He grinned for the first time in the two hours of chatting. &quot;There is a big pond in the back mountain. We use a big net to catch fish, and there are a lot of shrimps and crabs. There are many flowers, plants and trees on the path over the pond, which is fun.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But the last time I saw my cousin, In his eyes, the other person has &quot;grown up&quot;, his voice has changed, and he is a little unfamiliar, &quot;We can&#39;t play together anymore.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Guihong feels that Tian Lan&#39;s understanding of people and the world is narrow. &quot;But he is a child with a strong sense of justice and cannot hold a grain of sand in his eyes. So he will have his own expectations and requirements for the environment.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is why Tian Lan feels that, compared to others, The &quot;ugly duckling&quot; whose place is already much better will still have situations where &quot;small groups&quot; &quot;bully the weak&quot; that he can&#39;t stand. Vice-principal Xiang Guoyue and life teacher Long Chengtong (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;&quot;Long Ge&quot;&lt;/span>;) neither deny that they have a naughty personality and a bit of a tad There are indeed children in the &quot;Ugly Duckling&quot; who are addicted to the world. &quot;We will observe and deal with it, and we will also let each child face his own problems.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Lao Li said that I have problems with my emotions and emotional expression. I also feel that I am a little confused. As the saying goes , only after you have experienced it will you feel more... precious? I can&#39;t describe it.&quot; Tian Lan let out a long sigh. &quot;Anyway, I feel like my life is not worth it and I hope to do it all over again.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/ 471J7UgFwzxkHKyWZMNg9esZ9twVNQJ4swH9nKtU.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;546&quot; height=&quot;364&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/471J7UgFwzxkHKyWZMNg9esZ9twVNQJ4sw H9nKtU.jpg&quot; data- key=&quot;256489&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Zhan Danian at school&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern People Weekly reporter Weng Huan /Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;At an altitude of 1,800 meters, waiting for the flowers to bloom&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Children like Pu Pu and Tian Lan, in the Ugly Duckling Middle School in mid-October 2023, a total of There are more than seventy people. Some of them had mild or obvious symptoms of depression when they entered school, and some had already been diagnosed with depression or anxiety and took medication to enroll. There are also some &quot;problem students&quot; who may have nothing to do with &quot;depression&quot; but are troublesome to the original school or parents and difficult to discipline. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhan Danian, the founder of &quot;Ugly Duckling&quot;, does not accept this labeling term. In his eyes, every child does not have any big problems. They just cannot adapt to the teaching methods and evaluation standards of traditional education, and encounter various obstacles in getting along with their families, teachers, and peers. &quot;I even feel that in the era of ChatGPT, these so-called &#39;problem children&#39; are more creative and more hopeful.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1981, Zhan Danian, a native of Yiyang, Hunan Province, graduated from a normal college at the age of 26.

During his tenure, the rural school that originally had just over a hundred students expanded into a medium-sized school with over a thousand students. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But after working in the system for nearly 20 years, Zhan Danian decided to resign. After that, he came to Yunnan and participated in the establishment of two private schools. Until 2011, he founded the Ugly Duckling Middle School with his wife Yang Liufang and several colleagues, and made it his lifelong ambition. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;My leaving the system has nothing to do with courage, but with personal choice.&quot; He emphasized again and again. &quot;Our educational environment places too much emphasis on &#39;picking the best and chasing the poor&#39;. Once the children do not do well, they seem to have no future. The value of education is to develop people, how can it become the elimination of people? I want to give myself and those who are not valued and The caring children find a way out.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhan Danian&#39;s Mandarin has a strong Yiyang accent, and he once said with a smile that &quot;the voice software cannot recognize it.&quot; But this man with a face like Maitreya and a slightly bulging belly has become a powerful activist in innovative education. Over the years, he has blazed a path that seems to be a &quot;deviant path&quot; but is actually a &quot;passenger path&quot; that is extremely difficult to imitate. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In &quot;Ugly Duckling&quot;, students generally enroll for as little as 5 months and as long as more than two years, and will study courses from the first to the third grade of junior high school. Zhan Danian hopes that after they study here for about 10 months, their behavior and habits will return to normal and they can handle their interpersonal relationships normally, and then he will persuade them to return to their original school. &quot;After all, it is more convenient to go back to study with your parents. Its mission is not to let the children enter high school first, but to live a normal life or even survive.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the year when the school was founded, Zhan Danian&#39;s good friend, Wang Yeju, deputy director of the Culture and History Committee of the Yunnan Provincial Committee of the CPPCC, named the school &quot;Ugly Duckling&quot;. Many people couldn&#39;t understand it. Some freshmen also thought it was &quot;very earthy&quot;, but Zhan Danian felt like he had found a treasure: &quot;The duckling may be eaten by others, but the ugly duckling may be eaten by others.&quot; I will definitely be able to fly in one day!&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many of the so-called &quot;problem children&quot; are accompanied by social and psychological problems. But in the first few years, Zhan Danian and his colleagues did not discover and realize the seriousness of the problem. Until 2021, an internal psychological assessment at the school found that 71 of more than 90 students at the school were rated as &quot;severely depressed.&quot; He began to seriously examine this issue and spoke out many times on private accounts and other occasions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I want more people to understand teenage depression. Depression can be treated. But we should understand the voices of children more. They should not be marginalized.&quot; Before coming to Yiliang, he spoke on the phone Tell me solemnly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before traveling, I asked him to share a few &quot;cases&quot; of depressed students. He smiled and said, &quot;Who is the right person to talk about? You can talk to the children at will when you come. Each of their experiences can write a million-word novel.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the late autumn season, from Kunming Less than an hour&#39;s drive later, we entered Yiliang County and walked upstream along the Nanpan River. After passing bougainvillea and bushes along the way, our noses began to be filled with the &quot;scent&quot; of chicken and duck feces and the smoke of burning straw all over the village. At the fork in the road, there is a sign indicating &quot;Ugly Duckling Middle School&quot; pointing in the direction of the destination. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The original location of Ugly Duckling is located in the ancient town of Yiliang North, with convenient transportation. However, because the school building was in disrepair, more than two years ago, Zhan Danian led everyone to move the school to a new location more than 1,800 meters above sea level. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As you step into the teaching building, you will be greeted by the wooden bars, bookcases and guitars hanging all over the wall in the corridor on the first floor. The wood is taken from local fir trees. The wood is not expensive, but it is tall and beautiful. &quot;The children built it together with us.&quot; Zhan Danian introduced. The camphor trees and geraniums outside the window, the coral cherry blossoms, Guanyin lotus, Green Princess, platinum philodendron on the windowsill, the layers of green in the pots are very pleasant. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It may seem ordinary, but it has “superior” conditions that most schools in China cannot match: an average of more than 2,100 hours of sunshine per year. During the day in October, I feel slightly hot after just a few minutes with my back to the sun. Zhu Xiaomao, a visiting educator, couldn&#39;t help himself. He took three books as pillows and lay down directly on the ground in the playground. &quot;It&#39;s a waste not to lie down. Only a school with sunshine can truly warm people&#39;s hearts.&quot; Zhu Xiaomao lamented. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/q3ntqxMMAWsWkelyuY6CHwcPdvtJ1WtIcSCfdPUa.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;401&quot; height= &quot;267&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/q3ntqxMMAWsWkelyuY6CHwcPdvtJ1WtIcSCfdPUa.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256490&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In October 2023, in a psychology class at Ugly Duckling Middle School, students were expressing their views on the topic of &quot;Youth Sprout&quot;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern Characters Weekly reporter Weng Huan/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Morning jog in the morning, 40 minutes of physical education class in the morning, and 40 minutes of military training class in the afternoon. &quot;Every day we ensure at least three hours of outdoor exercise. , not including the children’s free time.” Zhan Danian said proudly, and Vice Principal Yang Liufang went on to introduce: “At noon in winter, the children often lie here (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;The anti-corrosion wooden stage in the playground&lt;/span>;) is very comfortable for reading and chatting. The school will arrange for people to mop and clean these wooden boards so that they can &#39;lie down&#39;.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is a piano in the corridor where students can play freely after class. The classrooms are concentrated on the second floor. There are only three classrooms for grades 7, 8, and 9. Each classroom is very spacious: the first half is the classroom, and the second half is separated by a hallway made of bookshelves. There are only one or two rows of tables for Student discussions and activities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Except for the principal and his wife, Xiang Guoyue, Li Guihong and &quot;Brother Long&quot; who came to the school not long after the school was founded, the teachers are all young. Several times I mistakenly thought that the teachers were talking to students. &quot;There are not many traces of teachers here. There are no school uniforms or uniforms.&quot; Zhan Danian said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But the class schedule written with a pen on the classroom wall is full of &quot;teachers&quot;: Juanjuan, Bobo, Zifu - the professor&#39;s nickname replaced the course name. The blackboard has also been replaced by a whiteboard covering almost the entire wall, smooth and oversized. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;ugly duckling&quot; advocates comprehensive teaching. There are only three cultural courses here: liberal arts, science and English. Liberal arts teachers are responsible for teaching Chinese, history, and politics; science teachers are responsible for teaching mathematics, physics, and chemistry. &quot;Most of the children who come here have their self-confidence hurt, relationships destroyed, and even their personality disintegrated. If the subject teachers only have one or two classes a week to contact the students, they will not be able to get to know the students after a semester, and it is difficult to live up to our expectations. That kind of blending of lives. Only by contacting as many children as possible can we establish the &#39;relationship&#39; that education should have.&quot; Zhan Danian explained. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the Chinese language class of the second grade of junior high school, a classmate asked, &quot;Juanjuan, can we drive a &#39;small train&#39; today?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Yes!&quot; Next, the students They stood up one by one, like dominoes. After each person read a sentence of the ancient Chinese text &quot;Book of Thoughts with Zhu Yuan&quot; that they had just learned, they translated it themselves, and the next one did the same - this was a game that everyone enjoyed playing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Hey, how did you steal someone else&#39;s carriage?&quot; Juanjuan sneered, but did not blame her. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Who is that? You just arrived today, right?&quot; She said to a slightly nervous freshman sitting in the back row, &quot;We have a &#39;freshman protection period&#39;, so you don&#39;t have to answer this question. I look forward to your performance in the future.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In &quot;The Ugly Duckling&quot;, students use tablet computers to check information in almost every cultural class and then return them to the teacher; after class, they can use the classroom touch screen to enjoy music and watch movies. Watch short videos; and have the &quot;benefits&quot; of having free access to the Internet one or two nights a week - of course, on a tablet. Mobile phones are strictly prohibited from being used unless taking leave to visit relatives. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Are you addicted to the Internet and can’t stand without your mobile phone?” No one seems to think so. After two cultural classes every afternoon, students not only participate in military training, but also have two interest classes and club activities: guitar, dance, vocal music, and basketball. No need to be fixed, you can do whatever you want. If you are really not interested, you can play cards, piano, read books, chat with people, hit sandbags, or walk on the playground. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The 3rd, 13th and 23rd of each month are the &quot;street days&quot; (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 毷体, 毷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;market day&lt; /span>;). The life teacher will take the students out of the school gate and go out to the market. &quot;Soy milk fried dough sticks, rice cakes, buckwheat cakes, scallion pancakes, biscuits and hawthorn rolls, hot and sour chicken feet, passion fruit flavor, there are all kinds of delicious things.&quot; Ji Guoer, a second-year junior high school girl, described to me, a glutton. It seems to have come out from the mouth. &quot;Sometimes on weekends, the teacher will take us to the county town to soak in hot springs, eat barbecue, hot pot, and go camping. It&#39;s fun.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/ cms/medias/image/23/11/01/87mzFhHs2aAVvAn0lrtqpq7ngfD3U1EC1lnciydw.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;538&quot; height=&quot;348&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/ 23/11/01/87mzFhHs2aAVvAn0lrtqpq7ngfD3U1EC1lnciydw.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256491&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Students’ self-portraits on the corridor wall of the teaching building &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern People Weekly reporter Weng Huan/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The creation of good relationships&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&quot;Education cannot be rushed . A good relationship is a good education.&quot; This is Zhan Danian&#39;s most well-known &quot;motto&quot; in the education circle. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A student who once studied at the &quot;Ugly Duckling&quot; described the &quot;Zhan style school management&quot; in his mind: &quot;I don&#39;t think you have any other tricks. Just don&#39;t punish those students who are prone to getting into trouble.&quot; Provoke them; then, just let them eat, drink and have fun.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhan Danian laughed loudly, &quot;You are right. That&#39;s it.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Previously Li Zhenxi, an education expert who emphasizes &quot;scientific management&quot;, always feels &quot;too mysterious&quot; every time he hears Zhan Danian emphasize &quot;understanding&quot;, &quot;trust&quot; and &quot;relationship is everything&quot;. Now he understands Zhan Danian more and more. “教育不能仅仅规范行为，更应该关注心灵。&#39;丑小鸭&#39;是把孩子当人，着眼于每一个人的人格尊严、精神自由。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在成人眼中“有问题”的孩子，也会成为彼此心灵的照护者。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在“丑小鸭”，除了行政班和宿舍的生活班，每位新生还会被分配一名学长“师傅”，帮他们熟悉校园生活，克服生活中的负面情绪。有的孩子刚来时不吃饭、不洗漱、不洗衣服，说什么都不听。 “师傅”会带他们到心理室，但老李小杨并不一定立马介入，而是由学长陪其玩游戏，“有的学生是游戏高手，有的老师打游戏也很厉害，我们就给他介绍，他们可以聊很久。喜欢追番的，喜欢二次元和漫画的，喜欢唱歌、玩乐器的，都会慢慢凑到一起……”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/Sqc4Q0JTj4fIrtsrkp9D6kpi2OdyCkXc8K3mkGpV.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;538&quot; height=&quot;348&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/Sqc4Q0JTj4fIrtsrkp9D6kpi2OdyCkXc8K3mkGpV.jpg&quot;

&lt;p>;“丑小鸭”一度最红火的学生社团是心理社。 2014年8月3日，云南昭通发生地震。震后第二天，詹大年带领几个孩子驱车三百余公里，把救灾物资送到受灾村民手中。但他发现，灾区儿童的心理亟需干预和辅导，这恰恰是“丑小鸭”学生们可以着力的地方。很快，对心理辅导完全陌生的学生们查阅地震资料，请教心理老师：怎样帮助灾区哭泣和绝望的孩子？第二次进灾区，一群不到15岁的半大孩子，被一群更小的孩子唤作“老师”，一起做游戏，聊家常，带给了他们难得的欢笑。 “对我们的孩子，这也是一次极好的自我教育。”詹大年甚是欣慰。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;采访中，几位师生都向我提起一个叫罗亭的“学霸”男孩。 “有国外生活经历，家境好，人也帅，可一点都不显摆。”来丑小鸭之前，罗亭先后就读于上海一所国际学校和公立学校，因为对学校教学的不适应和疫情长期居家，最后干脆不去学校。每天大门不出，一言不发，把从小看着他长大的爷爷给愁坏了。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;到了千里之外的“丑小鸭”，他觉出这学校“挺不一样”，却也没有“一见倾心”。头一两个月，罗亭到哪儿都埋头做题，不与任何人说话。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;不知从哪天开始，他弹起走廊里那架珠江钢琴，像变了个人。 “小学二年级的时候学过半年，已经荒了四五年，相当于从头开始自学。”他不求速成，一首《卡农》和《花之舞》，照着搜到的曲谱来回弹上一学期，同学不时凑过来听，他也安然继续。 “那种愉悦，很难用言语表达。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;后来，罗亭和趣味相投的之寒、嘉渝成了死党。他们会凑在一起谈论中美贸易、俄乌冲突。初三下学期，几个人成立了学习小组，纷纷利用宝贵的“军训课免修”时间自习备考。 “在&#39;丑小鸭&#39;，我还喜欢上了跑步。”罗亭微笑着说。 “之寒原本体重超过100公斤，跑步以后，他瘦了40公斤，成了学校的传奇！”之寒的“励志跑”把罗亭也带成了跑步达人。学校的跑道接近125米一圈，他们每天跑上40圈，几乎“雷打不动”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;季果儿是个大大咧咧、“外粗内细”的女生。聊天时，她时不时地将视线转开，最后终于指着篮球架边一个人影，“小邓老师，我有个闺蜜在那边，她也好想和你聊聊。”于是，我和季果儿、她的闺蜜何蔓，手挽着手绕着操场走了一圈又一圈。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;季果儿说，何蔓有阵儿爱哭，她也不问那么多，就逗她笑。 “我跟她说，你哭起来可丑。她说你真讨厌。哈哈，这招儿管用。”季果儿笑得没心没肺。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“那对有些不爱说话的同学呢？”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“我们都在一个生活班，住在一个屋檐下，再不爱说话的人，久了都会说些各自的小秘密。你要是天天跟她念叨，她自然会来找你。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;她掰着指头和我说起同学的好：晓星老大方，不记仇；景雯喜欢看书、弹钢琴；何蔓开朗，性格好……&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“你刚说她爱哭？”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“嘿，她一看到我哭，又把自己眼泪憋回去，把我安慰好。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我们乐成一团。她却严肃起来：“其实像我们这么大的人都好面子，不希望显得弱，希望自己强。那得让他们（&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;同学&lt;/span>;）慢慢接受这个世界。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;看起来做事积极、待人周到、能指出他人问题的季果儿，在老师们眼中也会出言不逊，容易失去表达的边界。向国跃说，青春期的孩子常会表现出刺猬的特征。 “丑小鸭”的学生在原来学校和家庭里个人意志可能被强压着，到了这里就会反应出来。从2011年便加入学校的李桂红，原来也觉得孩子们“不守规矩”，总会用一些类似恶作剧的方式宣告他们的存在。 “詹校说，对孩子们要用放大镜看优点、老花镜看缺点。于是我也学会了欣赏他们。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“在&#39;丑小鸭&#39;，爱说话就让你接待新同学，会钢琴就尽可能地给机会弹；文章写得好会被张贴。我们有位C诗人，写了一篇关于爱情，一篇谈人生的，大家都可崇拜他了……不管是文艺演出还是演讲比赛，学校要求每个人都得上场，打酱油也要上台，演成什么样都给你鼓掌呵呵。”季果儿的话像袋子打开口的豆子，倾泻而出。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“对，还有小英。”从警校毕业的生活老师龙金英刚满二十，一头长发挡不住浑身的英气。采访那几天，她不是在拾掇买来的盆栽，就是拿着锯子锯木条、垒花架。 “小英太厉害了。生病帮你配药，装修、刷墙，火把节跳傣族舞，全能！她对情绪爆发的孩子很有一套，会让你出去走走。等冷静下来，再和你聊。”季果儿与何蔓心目中的小英，俨然已是女生们共同的“偶像”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/FXAdGQ7EL1u9qNNPEzEj4kyufjey5KUhzOnecwsB.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;546&quot; height=&quot;364&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/FXAdGQ7EL1u9qNNPEzEj4kyufjey5KUhzOnecwsB.jpg&quot;

&lt;p>;但能干如小英、向国跃，也有不太使得上劲的时候。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“像朴朴和田榄，他们的父母虽然也和他们发生过争执，但总体还是能平复下来，接受孩子当下的状态，与学校配合。”向国跃指出，最难办的是，有的家长把孩子送过来，是希望“你按照他们的方式来教育孩子，只关心成绩，不关心背后是什么”；或者意识不到自己的问题，很难沟通；更有甚者，对孩子几乎不闻不问。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“孩子心里缺爱，父母却很少回应，甚至带给他们一次次的伤害。于是亲子之间彼此伤害。有的孩子还会被迫卷入成年人的关系之中，学会了暴力、疏离和冷漠。”李桂红说。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;有感于亲情教育的重要，詹大年从办学不久便开设了家长课堂。他的私人公号长年以一天两条消息的频率持续传播教育理念。许多家长在孩子抑郁、厌学、和父母停止交流后，从詹大年的公号上获得精神力量。有的，则直接将孩子送来这里。但转变却非朝夕之功。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;大脸庞、眸子明亮的何蔓，生长在中越边境的H城。她对童年印象最深的画面便是，爸爸骑着摩托车带她上学，妈妈晚上忙于美容院的生意，白天在睡觉。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;四年级转学到Q城，爸爸没时间照看她，便找了她原来的数学老师，花钱请她跨城过来做“保姆+辅导老师”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;从六年级到初二，何蔓辗转换了五六次学校。 “当时我当啦啦操副队长，跑步也跑第一。高年级的男生加我微信和QQ，同年级女生看我不爽，骂我绿茶。初二的学生威胁我交保护费，我只好拼命往后门跑，痞子挺多。老师说我学习不好，不让其他人跟我玩。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;她在墙角抽烟，被人举报。 “其实大家都抽，但他们只说我。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;她和爸爸哭诉，没用。 “没好好听我说。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“妈妈呢？”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“妈妈连我初一下学期学校在哪里、住哪里都不知道。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;她吞过二十来颗布洛芬，都是感冒时去学校医务室一点点存下的。 “跳楼也不行，都围着栏杆，没条件。就吃药了。活着真的没意义。妈妈跟老师说我鬼迷眼，故意吓他们。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;她再次从学校逃开。到底被爸妈逮住，在H城老家的地下车库关了一个晚上。 “用铁丝打我，扇我，掐我脖子，拉着我洗文身。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;她又回到Q城。去手机店上班，又被爸妈带回。 “他们只想抓我回去。我太多太多的人生，他们都没有参与。我只想逃脱。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;说到这儿，有个请了几天假的女生回到学校，何蔓看着大门口，露出一丝开心：“我们好多同学休假回来，常常带一大袋话梅薯片果冻、披萨给我们吃。有的会给生活班每个人都带杯奶茶，可美咯。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在“丑小鸭”，娟娟让她当班长；杨校让她接待来访客人；小英会安慰她，好好听她说话。刚来这里不久就赶上了夏令营，“从早到晚我们都在操场聊天，天黑了一起看电影、吃烧烤……”她原以为，到“丑小鸭”以后第一次给父母打电话自己会哭，结果竟然全程欢笑。 “我本来对前男友很执着，老李说，我其实对恋爱一窍不通。哈哈。不过我真的知道了，外面虚虚渺渺，我现在学会看人了。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;因为课程落下太多，15岁的她在“丑小鸭”重修初二。她不着急，慢慢地体恤起总是对她“恨铁不成钢”的爸爸。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;爷爷奶奶老家不在云南，过来几十年，在镇上还是不受待见。五十开外的爸爸，早年在H城做会计，在何蔓眼里其实是家族中最懂事的一个。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“他是家里最正经做事的，可小时候吃到一块糖都奢侈。他恨家里人，觉得不公平，什么烂摊子都是他去擦屁股。所以他希望我有出息，能留在身边。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;来“丑小鸭”前，何蔓曾去昆明看过心理医生。 “医生说，你们两代人之间隔阂太深。反正我好多事情，爸妈不问，我也不说。有时候我调皮，就是想故意气他们一下。”她顿了顿，语气柔和下来：“我爸有糖尿病，我现在不会再故意气他了。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;小野的故事里，则几乎只有她和母亲。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“今天是我来到丑小鸭的第136天。”刚坐下，她清晰地说出这个日子。每过一天，她都会在日历上划掉一杠——“感觉又离回家近了一天。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;和另外几个女生迫不及待的分享欲不同，小野的眼神和嘴角都带着一分打量。她擅长美术，最近学校的“班级文化”，从楼梯间到宿舍墙壁再到走廊的装饰画，她全有贡献；唱歌、跳舞，样样拿得出手。但好像这些还不够满足她的渴望。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“她经常自伤，拿尺子、石头，中性笔掰断，什么都用。手和腿抓得跟鱼鳞似的。”李桂红说，朴朴的自残更多是一种情绪宣泄，小野的行为里还多了一份“求得关注”的意图。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在小野的描述里，妈妈会觉得离婚是因为女儿的缘故，“所以老带着私人情绪怨怼我。”从很小起，妈妈越是不许她干什么，她就越来越想做。一吵架，两人总是拿出恶毒的语言互相指责，“她说我有妄想症。我说你也去看看，肯定你有问题。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;小野曾经很爱给妈妈写信，写微信，或者手写几百字的信，再拍照发给“老李”。 “其实是希望我转发给她妈妈。有的外省的父母可能来三四次了，她觉得妈妈怎么老不来。不来就是不爱我。要立刻实现才是爱我。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“等我们长大了，要把那些叛逆的家长送到一间叫&#39;丑老鸭&#39;的学校去，或者叫&#39;丑小鸡&#39;，哈哈！”说起和同学瞎聊时的提议，小野耸肩大笑。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;可妈妈知道她想买“洛丽塔”服饰，爱看漫展，都会全力支持。 “我不是个合格的女儿……对不起我妈。”小野眼眶有点泛红。她希望自己早点独立，能挣钱，“出去了给我妈打钱。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“亲爸？没见过，因为我是女孩就不要我了。他现在想见我？没可能。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;关于“丑小鸭”，她来之前查过这地方，学校名字怪怪的。 “过一种幸福完整的教育生活……”她喃喃念起引自教育家朱永新的这句“丑小鸭”校训，“能实现吗？”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;她拒绝上到初三毕业，希望早点离开，因为外头有好多好玩的等着她。在老家，她小学四五年级就跑去KTV，“那些加微信的姐姐都好漂亮。”她们称赞她“会唱歌跳舞，化妆也好，不会惹事”，还有大人教她“不要太在乎别人看法”这样的人生道理，她都觉得可长见识、可快活了。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;她希望老李和妈妈沟通，让她回去。但妈妈不放心，“在宜良能够切断她和老家的社会关系。”李桂红说，她曾婉转地提醒小野，社会上的人讲义气，但小恩小惠后面很可能有对未成年人的利用。 “这些道理她暂时还不太能听进去，但我们总得要一点一点和她讲。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/BYA0RMGelbZiZ46SxJFr4d0fM8KD2hJpXWFgFPnw.jpg&quot;

&lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;2023年10月21日，首届青少年心理安全论坛讲座现场&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（南方人物周刊记者翁洹/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;新的教育哲学&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;怀揣着更多个朴朴和小野的故事，我暂别待了三天的“丑小鸭”，前往昆明。关于青少年抑郁，各种专题讨论早已屡见不鲜，但10月21-22日在昆明举办的首届青少年心理安全论坛的热度还是超出了主办方的预料。踊跃发言者，从写纸条、抢话筒，到有人直接冲到大舞台边，要“带着冒犯”地直抒胸臆。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一位詹大年的读者表示，自己从小学习顺利，一直就读本地最好的学校，但从来不快乐也没有成就感，三十好几还在迷茫；几位老师和家长带着孩子遇到的校园霸凌、心理疾病问题现场求助；还有几位来自不同学校的老师提出，想要去关怀学生，却势单力薄，“我们也是问题老师，谁来帮助我们？！”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“既说明大家有巨大的表达欲和想要解决问题的热忱，也说明，无论是教育工作者还是孩子家长，很多人本身也都存在着心理问题需要被看到，被疏导。”一位与会嘉宾感叹。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2021年6月修订实施的《未成年人保护法》明确规定：教育行政部门应当加强未成年人的心理健康教育，建立未成年人心理问题的早期发现和及时干预机制。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但在论坛内外，大家讨论更多的，是那些引发抑郁或者因抑郁导致的现实生活中的问题。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;著名教育专家冯恩洪指出，构筑青少年心理安全教育防线所面对的，是当今社会在教育问题上的全体性迷失。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;陈瑜是家庭教育平台“少年大不同”创始人，曾深度访谈过上百个抑郁、厌学、挣扎绝望的中小学生。今年找她当面和电话咨询的学生里，数量激增的是高一新生。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“有的孩子上高一第一天，做作业到夜里11点。老师说，你都上高中了，还指望睡好觉吗？有北京&#39;六小强&#39;（&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;海淀名校&lt;/span>;）的学生问我，我为什么需要学到滴水不漏、一字不差的程度？这是很多孩子的困惑。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;有学生告诉陈瑜，开学第一天，学校里做如是动员：“拥有成绩，就拥有一切。坐在你身边的同学，都是中考考场的敌人。”她遇到一位深圳名校的女生，凌晨4点起来读书，渐渐地例假也不来了。她问女孩，“一切都要为分数让道吗？成绩比身体还重要吗？”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“女孩说，是的。&#39;这样也好，我再不用担心考试撞上生理期了。&#39;还有辽宁一位排名年级第一的孩子觉得自己&#39;像窃取了皇帝桂冠的窃贼&#39;，好像坐在高台上，一阵风吹来，就会倒掉。”陈瑜总结，这一代的孩子，厌学更早，休学更长，复学更难。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“如果孩子视力下降、睡眠不足、体质羸弱、心理畸形，乃至生命夭折，所有教育的辉煌成就都毫无意义！”李镇西在他的演讲中疾呼。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当学生有抑郁倾向或被确诊，会遭遇截然不同的境遇。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;陈瑜访谈过的一个孩子，确诊抑郁症之后被同学排挤，课桌里塞满了垃圾和矿泉水瓶。后来新的班主任约她出来在咖啡馆聊，复学的时候，她牵着小姑娘的手走进学校，到班级门口的时候，全班同学鼓掌欢迎她，孩子心理发生了剧变。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但在江浙某地，有学校给临近高三的学生做了心理测评和评估，“校方对其中一些孩子说，你目前的情绪状态没有办法适应学校接下来的学业。就把他们退学了。很多抑郁症的孩子也会说，我回到家里以后就没有任何的老师和学生来联系我。他觉得我从此被这个组织抛弃了。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;解决之道在哪里？ &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;教育家杨东平的回答是，教育部门不断推出“减负”新政，然而如何摆脱教育方针与教育现实长期两张皮、素质教育缺乏生命力的状态？答案只有一个：中国需要新的教育哲学，要从头做起自上而下的顶层设计。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;他进一步提出：要从源头上减少课程教学时数，降低教学浓度、考试难度，推行小学的全科教师模式，改善教育生态；取消重点学校，试点学科分层，有利于学生之间的交流，减少因教育分流制度而造成的贴标签或受歧视的现象。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“当你把孩子当作一个人来尊重，跟他相处，你就会得到一个正常健康的人；如果你把孩子当作学习机器，那你得到的就是一个物件。”杨东平的掷地有声和詹大年的朴素语言都引起了听众的强烈共鸣。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;来丑小鸭中学参观和阅读詹大年公号的读者感受到，“问题孩子”在这里找回了自己，也认识了生活，他们可以重新起航。 “那么，一所普通学校能办成&#39;丑小鸭&#39;吗？假如对正常的孩子也是以这种方式教育会怎样？”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;然而詹大年一直强调，丑小鸭中学是一种预防型的学校，是为不适应传统教育体制的孩子提供适合的教育方式，而非提供一种解困的方法论。 “我们今天碰到的所有教育症结，都不是一个论坛能改变的。但它能提供一种思考：我们的教学，我们的家庭教育，是不是出了什么问题？这就是这些探讨和发声能起到的作用。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在人前似乎“难不倒”的詹大年，坦承他面对抑郁和其他表现的孩子常有束手无策的时刻。曾经有一个父母分开的混血女生，一根脚趾被自己用皮筋缠到坏死，来了“丑小鸭”又想缠另一根。来了好几个月依然头也不抬，进展缓慢。 “这孩子后来我们只好劝退了，因为已经超出了我们的能力范围，需要医疗机构的干预。”詹大年的语调里有一种少见的失落与无力。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我问陈瑜，假如学校环境很难改变，有的父母又像嘉宾们说的“冥顽不灵”，她会给访谈的那些孩子怎样的建议？ &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“我期待国内的职高和技术学校现状有所转变，让有一技之长的普通人都能过上体面的生活。一个孩子但凡有那么一点闪光的部分，他就不会全然否定自己。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一个泉州的妈妈曾向她求助：儿子智商略有缺陷，她很希望孩子能跟上同学学习的节奏，但孩子已经开始厌学。陈瑜了解到男孩非常喜欢饲养宠物，“我说你跟着我想象一下，在你们生活的这条街上有爸爸开的海鲜店，有你开的影楼，有你孩子开的花鸟鱼虫店，不是很美好吗？她说陈老师，以前别人都劝我也要&#39;卷&#39;，听你这么一说，我就很开心了。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“在当下，看懂孩子和时代尤为重要。每个孩子都自带粮草和地图。我们要为孩子全面托底，不要让他们举目四望，寂寥无人。”陈瑜打着比方。 “一位理解你的补课老师，一个值得信任的男朋友/女朋友，都可以是支点。”如果身边就是没有托底的人，我会告诉他们，挺一挺，18岁以后你就有机会疗愈自己，要成为自己滋养自己的人。 ”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;结束在“丑小鸭”的采访前，朴朴告诉我，她希望回到那所“高质量严管控”的中学参加中考，因为姑父开出租车，刚念初一的堂弟要一边做作业、一边带两岁的小弟弟，还要给姑父做饭，如果她长大有份好工作，“可以让堂弟不那么辛苦”；何蔓说，以前老和爸爸吵架，现在隔几天会念叨，爸爸怎么不发消息；一直在自学日语、过了N2的小野长大想当插画师，“妈妈支持我去日本留学”；季果儿的妈妈则希望她能上警校，“可我想当幼师，教小朋友。詹校也觉得我可以哈。 ”&lt;/p>;
