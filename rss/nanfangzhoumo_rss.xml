At that time, he was still a graduate student at the School of Society and Demography at Renmin University of China. A course on qualitative research methods led him to set his sights on a costume drama called &quot;The Order of Mountains and Rivers&quot;. The relationship between the two protagonists in the play leaves room for the audience to imagine intimate emotions, attracting a large number of &quot;CP fans&quot; to stop. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the East Asian cultural circle, the trend of &quot;consuming CP&quot; has been around for a long time. It first appeared in the ACGN (animation, comics, games, novels) circle and refers to pairing (Coupling) between two characters, referred to as &quot;CP&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Prior to this, Xu Guanwen paid attention to this cultural form twice. The first time was in high school. My deskmate selected two male characters from the Japanese manga &quot;Kuroko&#39;s Basketball&quot; - Aomine Daiki and Kise Ryota, and wrote a CP &quot;fanfic&quot; for them. &quot;Aomine Daiki&#39;s character is aggressive, while Kise Ryota is more elegant and has a wild side inside. Their roles complement each other to a certain extent, and there are certain areas that can be explored.&quot; Although the article written by the same deskmate is only a fragment It&#39;s a sitcom, but Xu Guanwen can feel a &quot;strong emotional connection&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The second time was when he was an undergraduate student in sociology. He was chatting with his graduate student and found that the other party was doing research on &quot;Whether Danmei literature has an impact on real gay men&quot;. He realized that, Popular culture will be related to real-life emotional practices. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2021, thinking of the two intersections with CP culture, Xu Guanwen was once again aroused his &quot;long-standing curiosity&quot;. He started with friends around him and conducted snowball interviews with 55 CP fans, including 53 women and 2 men. Most of the interviewers were surprised at first: Why would a boy who doesn’t take CP want to learn about this issue? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One of the few male CP fans is a fan of the female idol team AKB48. He thinks the members are beautiful and beautiful, so he takes up the team’s CP; the other is a gay man who lives in daily life. It is difficult to find a partner and intimate relationship that meets their expectations, so they look for male CPs in Japanese dramas to project their emotional needs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to make the topic selection more focused, the interviews of two male CP fans were not included in the analysis. At the beginning of 2023, this paper titled &quot;&quot;CP-eating&quot;: Creative Emotional Experience of Young Female Fans&quot; was published in the &quot;Women&#39;s Studies Series&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It was originally a routine survey, but in October 2023, the paper suddenly became popular. This paper, which is full of words such as &quot;childhood sweetheart&quot; and &quot;soul mate&quot;, was forwarded and liked on social media, attracting attention and ridicule from &quot;addict experts&quot;: &quot;The paper the professor asked me to read is my first name.&quot; No matter how long I put it off, I read the paper on CP addiction with gusto, and even cried while reading it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Search for the keyword &quot;CP&quot; on CNKI and sort by the number of downloads, &quot;&quot;CP&quot;: Creative Emotional Experience of Young Female Fans&quot; ranks first in the relevant literature. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;An interviewer tried to give an answer as to why he is keen on taking CP: &quot;What I expect to see in CP is a kind of spiritual communication and soul resonance.&quot; In real life, marriage is Contracts, contractual relationships, and love are complex luxuries. In a world that is complex and open to multiple interpretations, CP is &quot;a relatively beautiful thing constructed.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/02/IvZpDtwHvl2xSXb2GfD8IBDuhzTTM5Wwh2X6yfJY.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;676&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/02/IvZpDtwHvl2xSXb2GfD8IBDuhzTTM5Wwh2X6yfJY.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256605&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Different CP combinations often appear among the members of idol groups. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;Some emotional needs are not satisfied in reality&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/ h4>; &lt;p>;Xu Guanwen does not take CP and calls himself an &quot;outsider&quot;. His in-depth understanding of CP culture is limited to 55 interviewers. When studying the craze of “eating CP” on the Internet, he paid more attention to the emotional mechanism behind it. When collecting information and designing the interview outline, the question he wanted to discuss with these CP fans was: What is their imagination of this kind of love? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2021, his master&#39;s thesis is about to be started. He was inspired by French sociologist Eva Iroth&#39;s &quot;Love, Why Does It Hurt?&quot; 》Inspired by this, I want to do cultural research on love. Eva Iroth discusses in the book: People are changing partners more and more frequently and faster, and there is a set of changes in emotional concepts behind this. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Xu Guanwen&#39;s view, &quot;romantic love&quot; seems to be imported from China. &quot;During the Republic of China, it was an ideological tool to criticize feudalism and encourage women to escape from the feudal patriarchal system. Lu Xun wrote &quot;What Happened After Nora Left&quot; and found that women did escape from the patriarchal system, but fell into the small family system. In the family, we are still restricted by the male-dominated family concept.&quot; Xu Guanwen told Southern Weekend reporters, &quot;In the 1970s and 1980s, we were exposed to a new round of Western literary and artistic works, such as &quot;Titanic&quot;, and everyone began to accept it again ( Freedom of marriage and love).&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xu Guanwen feels that since the concept of &quot;romantic love&quot; was introduced to China, it has assumed the role of rebelling against the current order, often running counter to economic rational decisions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Following this line of thinking, he decided to include the love concepts of contemporary Chinese youth groups into his research. I looked around, but found that I couldn&#39;t find a suitable research object. By chance, he saw a topic: &quot;I don&#39;t have to fall in love, but my partner must get married.&quot; The most direct question jumped out: Why are they so happy to have a love relationship with their partner? Why do they like to watch others fall in love, but don’t fall in love themselves? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He found his old friend Q as his first interview subject. The two met in a corner of the cafeteria and chatted for three hours in a pleasant atmosphere. The CP circle pays attention to &quot;enclosure and self-admiration&quot;, which refers to entertaining oneself in one&#39;s own small circle. Even if the CPs are the same A and B, if the order is reversed (such as the &quot;AB&quot; party and the &quot;BA&quot; party), it is possible I can&#39;t go together. Q rarely has the opportunity to chat with his peers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The CP that Q drank was a pair of male and female CPs in a certain boy group. Xu Guanwen initially thought that Q&#39;s boyfriend liked childish boys, but after in-depth conversation, he discovered that this was not the case. Q&#39;s boyfriend in real life was burly. The reason why Q likes this couple is that they don&#39;t deliberately maintain a sense of boundaries like adult men, but interact closely like children. &quot;That&#39;s the state of interpersonal interaction that she prefers. It&#39;s simple enough and the emotions are obvious enough.&quot; Xu Guanwen analyzed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;The encounter between a CP fan and CP may be an accident. She chose to learn more about it, possibly because there are certain qualities in CP that attracted her. She got emotional feedback at that moment, Therefore, she is positive and happy at the moment. As she gradually learns more about CP, the underlying things slowly emerge. What really induces this kind of emotional feedback is that certain emotional needs are not met in reality. .&quot; Xu Guanwen told Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, after chasing for several years, the couple finally &quot;be&quot; (bad ending, tragic ending). As the two grew older, Q watched the latest variety shows and found that their interaction became unnatural. &quot;The sense of boundary is very obvious. Even if you don&#39;t realize it, your body&#39;s reaction is very obvious.&quot; Q couldn&#39;t let go of it for a long time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The interviewees had different reasons for taking CP. Some people are frustrated by love in real life and heal their wounds in the relatively ideal and flawless CP world; some people feel stressed in real life and escape to the CP world to vent their emotions. There are also people who have a spectator mentality. In real life, love or marriage always makes people worry about gains and losses, and taking CP can make people objectively look at the emotional direction of a CP couple. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are still times when taking CP is just &quot;interesting&quot;. There are various unexpected combinations of protagonists from characters to actors, from reality to virtuality, from contemporary times to history. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On video websites, Jia Ling was paired up with various male stars and edited into CP videos. Daiyu and Voldemort are also favored by netizens and are paired up as contrasting characters. Xu Guanwen interviewed a girl who was a fan of Voltaire and Rousseau. The outside world often feels that these two people have different opinions and are lifelong enemies. This girl feels that there is room for further interpretation behind the historicized relationship. &quot;The antonym of enemy is friend. Are there other possibilities (for the relationship between the two)? For example, falling in love and killing each other.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms /medias/image/23/11/02/Ibo0RTSbVtuQnLkTBpD8F4EdP3EjktaCh8wRcytR.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;1797&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23 /11/02/Ibo0RTSbVtuQnLkTBpD8F4EdP3EjktaCh8wRcytR.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256606&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The two protagonists of the costume drama &quot;Chen Qing Ling&quot; It has become the target of many fans to &quot;eat CP&quot;. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Information picture/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;You can live without love, but you cannot live without love&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4 >; &lt;p>;When many people take CP, they first feel the impromptu and plump happiness. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xu Guanwen analyzed that behind this kind of immediate happiness, there is not only aesthetic satisfaction, but also the satisfaction of the demand gap of the current emotional state. Of course, some people put their own expectations for intimate relationships into it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;(This expectation) has been very concretely presented in CP. With continuous immersion, the concrete image changes from fuzzy to three-dimensional, so that happiness can continue. Because you can continue to explore , form your own understanding, and experience happiness in the process of exploration.&quot; Xu Guanwen told Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After interviewing 55 CP fans, Xu Guanwen found that the CP emotions that many people actively explore overflow the framework of conventional social life. One of Xu Guanwen&#39;s interviewers drank the CP of two male members of a Korean boy band, but he did not define the intimate relationship between the two as &quot;romantic love&quot;, but the Japanese word &quot;bond&quot;, which expresses a kind of &quot;friend or above&quot;. The emotion of “love is not full”. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The couple grew up together, and were both under 20 years old when the team was formed. This interviewer grew up in a Tongzilou, a group of children who spent their childhood playing around, and shared a similar background to her CP. &quot;She said that she took advantage of this couple because she and her (young) friend were separated by two places and could not meet each other. The kind of family-like connection she expected was seen in CP.&quot; Xu Guanwen said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xu Guanwen paid attention to the comments on social media and found that many people were moved by the interviewer&#39;s words: &quot;You can live without love, but you cannot live without love.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Just like Henry Jenkins As said, the popularity of CP culture itself has a reflection on heterosexual romantic narratives. CP fans are no longer satisfied with the old romantic narratives, but hope to discover unique emotional connections.&quot; Xu Guanwen wrote in the paper . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As a male, Xu Guanwen also discovered some gender differences in his research: when female CP fans romanticize male and female CP fans, they often regard holding hands, hugging, etc. as evidence of the intimacy between the two. . Xu Guanwen believes that this is typical female thinking. In fact, boys and girls have different sense of boundaries when expressing closeness to the same sex. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Differentiated emotional models present a complex and complex ecological landscape in the CP world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“You will see that CP culture itself is like a small society, with a very avant-garde side and a very conservative side.” Xu Guanwen told Southern Weekend reporters, “In Danmei CP fan works, maybe There will be some very avant-garde explorations of gender. The conservative side may be that I only consume heterosexual CP and follow the biggest mainstream (society).&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The CP world is like a diverse and diverse world. There is a free emotional market, and whether this market can affect emotional practice in reality, Xu Guanwen&#39;s investigation failed to give an answer. &quot;The reality I face, and how much freedom I have to make my own (emotional) practices, varies from person to person.&quot; Xu Guanwen said, &quot;But in general, it is happy first.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p >;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https: //feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt; br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 03 Nov 2023 09:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[“刘忠林”案代理律师被控三宗罪，一审获刑16年]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259844]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-03 08:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 11/02/mrRGzBS9fSCrOw1lSmD0jdnd5PFaXElNGDvrONZ2.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1267&quot; height=&quot;742&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/02/mrRGzBS9fSCrOw1lSmD0jdnd5PFaXElNGD vrONZ2. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256790&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The Fengman District Court of Jilin City issued a guilty verdict against Xiu Bao. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(People&#39;s Vision/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xiu Bao, who is well-known in the legal circles of Jilin City, Jilin Province, may not have thought that he would also &quot;cry out injustice&quot; for himself &quot;One day. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;Xiu Bao was the director of a law firm, president of the Jilin Lawyers Association, and vice president of the Jilin Provincial Lawyers Association. He served as a deputy to the provincial People&#39;s Congress and was once selected as a candidate for Touching China. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;It is worth mentioning that Xiubao was still the defender during the retrial of Liu Zhonglin’s case. Liu Zhonglin was sentenced to death with a suspended death sentence for intentional homicide and was imprisoned for 25 years and 3 months. He is the longest-term unjust person who has been detained for the longest period of time in public reports. In April 2018, the Jilin Provincial Higher People&#39;s Court changed the verdict and found Liu Zhonglin not guilty. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Today, Xiubao was found guilty of introducing bribes, offering bribes and fraud in two cases he had represented, and was sentenced to 16 years in prison in the first instance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Unsatisfied with the warranty, he appealed to the Jilin Intermediate Court on July 17, 2023. According to Southern Weekend reporters, the warranty repair case file was returned from the Jilin City Procuratorate to the Jilin City Intermediate Court on September 18, 2023. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the relevant provisions of the Criminal Procedure Law, the second instance court should promptly notify the procuratorate to review the case files after deciding to open a trial. The procuratorate shall complete the review within one month. The procuratorate&#39;s review time is not included in the trial period. The people&#39;s court of second instance that accepts appeals and protest cases shall conclude the proceedings within two months. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This means that the trial deadline for this case is November 18, 2023. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Acting bribery case of acting department official was accused of intermediary bribery&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The 68-year-old Xiubao had many auras before he lost his personal freedom. &lt;span>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Public information shows that he has been working as a lawyer since 1988, and later founded Jilin Baomin Law Firm and served as director. Xiubao has won many honors such as &quot;National Advanced Legal Aid Individual&quot; and &quot;National Outstanding Lawyer&quot;. In 2011, he was selected as a candidate for Touching China. In the legal profession of Jilin Province, he is the first deputy to the Provincial People&#39;s Congress. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xiu Bao&#39;s personal deeds have also been frequently reported in the newspapers, and he has been called a &quot;civilian lawyer&quot; and a &quot;worker&#39;s lawyer&quot; by the media. According to People&#39;s Daily Online in 2019, Xiubao has long helped laid-off workers and vulnerable groups safeguard their rights. It has represented more than 400 lawsuits for free in cases involving farmers infected with HIV and other people in need, and has recovered nearly 30,000 laid-off workers and vulnerable groups in accordance with the law. With 200 million yuan in compensation (compensation) and social security pensions, dozens of unjust, false and wrong cases were corrected, and 13 people who were wrongly imprisoned were acquitted, including Liu Zhonglin. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Three years after Liu Zhonglin was released, on January 24, 2022, because he was suspected of committing bribery and bribery, the Huadian City Supervisory Committee, which was managed by Jilin City, took detention measures. He was suspected of committing fraud and was criminally detained by the Panshi City Public Security Bureau of Jilin Province. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The repair and maintenance investigation was related to the bribery case of the first department official of Jilin Province whom we had previously represented. In September 2017, Liu Baowei, chairman of Jilin Provincial Investment Group Co., Ltd. and former secretary of the Tonghua Municipal Party Committee, was investigated. Later, in October 2018, he was prosecuted by the Jilin City Procuratorate on suspicion of accepting bribes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During this period, Xiu Bao served as Liu Baowei’s attorney, and was therefore accused of introducing bribes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The first-instance judgment of the Fengman District Court of Jilin City ([2023] Ji 0211 Xingchu No. 10) shows that the Procuratorate of Fengman District, Jilin City believed that in April 2018, Xiu Bao took advantage of the then deputy director of the Jilin Intermediate People’s Court. Due to his position, Dean Feng Qisheng asked Liu Baowei&#39;s family to contact Feng Qisheng&#39;s wife Tan Xuemei and pay a &quot;favor fee&quot; of 600,000 yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the first-instance verdict, Feng Qisheng admitted that when he was the presiding judge of Liu Baowei&#39;s case, he introduced Liu Baowei&#39;s relatives to give Tan Xuemei 600,000 yuan in favors in order to get a lighter sentence. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Feng Qisheng was dismissed from public office in July 2022 due to serious violations of discipline and law. His suspected criminal issues were transferred to the procuratorate for review and prosecution in accordance with the law. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporters learned from relevant parties that Feng Qisheng was sentenced to 11 years in prison by the Dongchang District Court of Tonghua City in December 2022. His wife Tan Xuemei took 5.93 million in bribes and was sentenced to 3 years in prison with a 4-year suspended sentence by the Fengman District Court in Jilin City. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the case of Feng and Tan, Xiu Bao was also implicated. On December 29, 2022, the Procuratorate of Fengman District, Jilin City filed a public prosecution against Xiubao. After the Jilin City Intermediate Court designated jurisdiction, the Fengman District Court opened the case and accepted it on January 11, 2023, and a public hearing was held on March 30 of the same year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On July 6, 2023, the Fengman District Court made a first-instance judgment, and Xiubao’s behavior in this case was found to be the crime of bribery and the crime of introduction of bribery. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the repair party insisted that it was not guilty. Xiu Bao&#39;s attorney believes that the evidence in the case cannot confirm that Liu Baowei&#39;s family paid a bribe of 600,000 yuan to Tan Xuemei. Xiu Bao has no motive for bribery and has no request for Tan Xuemei, which does not meet the standard of proof for conviction. Xiu Bao&#39;s son Xiu Zhiyu said that Xiu Bao and Feng Qisheng often argued about cases in public and were not familiar with each other in private, &quot;and Tan Xuemei is also a practicing lawyer.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;The crime of fraud in &quot;the money is scattered and people return&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In the first instance judgment, Xiubao was also found guilty of fraud. Related to a corruption and bribery case. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Procuratorate of Fengman District, Jilin City believes that from January to June 2019, Xiu Bao was entrusted by Luo to serve as the defender for her husband Yao Moulin&#39;s suspected corruption case, and Xiu Bao fabricated the need for Yao Moulin to be sentenced to probation. Luo then transferred money to his friend Cao, who later paid 1.6 million yuan in cash to the repair agent in person in three installments. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the first-instance judgment, the Fengman District Court held that when Xiu Bao met Yao Moulin at the Jilin City Detention Center, he asked him to write a note to Luo Mou, telling Luo Mou “Don’t feel bad about money, money. It’s a benefit for the forensic investigators.” The note said, “The money has been scattered and everyone will return.” “It’s time to spend money. It is estimated that it may cost 2 million (ten thousand) to 4 million (ten thousand). You can decide the specific situation.” Later, Xiubao found Cao and lied that he wanted to smoothen the relationship so that Luo could get the money. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the presiding judge and the judge who tried Yao Moulin&#39;s corruption case both testified that in Yao Moulin&#39;s case, Xiubao did not bribe the court investigators, and Yao Moulin&#39;s conviction and sentencing were in compliance with laws and regulations. . Xiu Bao also admitted in his confession that he had collected 900,000 yuan in attorney fees from Yao Moulin in the case, but denied fabricating reasons to smoothen the relationship to collect 1.6 million yuan from Luo. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, in Cao’s testimony, Cao said that after Luo remitted 1.6 million yuan to himself, he also remitted 1.3 million yuan to his driver, and after withdrawing cash, he together with the 300,000 yuan in his hand Yuan for repair. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Fengman District Court held that for the purpose of illegal possession, Xiubao fabricated facts that would allow Yao Moulin to get a lighter punishment for his crime through smoothing relationships, and defrauded the victim Luo Moumou of a particularly huge amount of property. constitutes the crime of fraud. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xiu Bao’s defense lawyer believes that the evidence in the case cannot prove the fact that Xiu Bao obtained 1.6 million yuan, and that Xiu Bao did not fabricate facts or conceal the truth. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Secondly, even if he accepted the 1.6 million yuan, it would at most be a violation of lawyer&#39;s professional ethics. After Xiubao accepted the entrustment, he completed all the meetings, review papers and court proceedings as a lawyer, and the client I am also very satisfied with the outcome of the case, so it does not constitute a crime of fraud.&quot; Xiu Bao&#39;s defense lawyer told Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, according to his son Xiu Zhiyu’s understanding, Yao Moulin and Luo did not recover the 1.6 million yuan from Xiu Bao, nor did they report the case to the public security agency. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the end, the court sentenced the repairman to fraud, sentenced him to twelve years in prison, and fined him RMB 200,000. In addition, the court also sentenced the prisoner to a fixed-term imprisonment of three years and a fine of RMB 200,000 for the crime of bribery; the prisoner was sentenced to a fixed-term imprisonment of two years and fined RMB 100,000 for the crime of introduction of bribery; and decided to execute the fixed-term imprisonment of 16 year, and a fine of RMB 50 yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;After the verdict of the first instance was pronounced, Xiu Bao appealed to the Jilin Intermediate Court. Currently, the case has entered the second instance procedure. On November 1, 2023, Southern Weekend reporters contacted the Jilin Intermediate People&#39;s Court several times about whether the second instance of the case would be heard, but received no reply. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xiu Zhiyu said that he hopes that the second instance can be heard in court. &quot;As long as the verdict is open and fair, and everyone understands the facts of the case and feels that my father deserves what he deserves, I think he will be relieved.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 03 Nov 2023 08:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[“纳卡”再得一分、强力介入中东：埃尔多安玩转地缘政治棋局]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259773]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-02 23:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Recently, the world situation has become increasingly turbulent, and conflicts between civilizations and regional conflicts among various ethnic groups have become increasingly intensified. Back to troubled times. Amid many conflicts and turbulence, Turkey&#39;s series of actions in recent years have become increasingly eye-catching. President Erdogan has earned himself the nickname &quot;Esultan&quot; with a series of dazzling combination punches. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the Syrian civil war in the past few years, it sent troops to northern Syria to support pro-Turkey armed factions and occupied and controlled part of the Syrian territory. In the process of fighting for the sphere of influence, Erdogan was bold and ruthless. He not only dared to take action against the Assad government forces, but also dared to shoot down Russian fighter jets and helicopters supporting the Syrian army. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the 2020 &quot;Azerbaijan-Azerbaijan War&quot;, Turkey supported Azerbaijan, severely damaged Armenia, and once again hit Russia&#39;s prestige in the Middle East. As a result, Turkey&#39;s status in the Middle East has been greatly improved, and many Arab people regard Erdogan as a national hero. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Erdogan dares to challenge Putin mainly because of his membership in NATO. He knows that under the protection of this political and military bloc, Russia will not directly attack Turkey for secondary and smaller overseas interests. It is a good way to use the power of the West to enhance one&#39;s prestige among the Islamic community. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the Russia-Ukraine conflict broke out in 2022, Turkey shuttled back and forth between several parties and experienced ups and downs: On the one hand, its participation led to the negotiation of the &quot;Black Sea Food Channel&quot; and improved its status among NATO member states. status. On the other hand, it used its veto power in NATO to delay Finland and Sweden&#39;s applications to join NATO. This has further improved his status in the Middle East. In the eyes of the people, Erdogan is a contemporary hero who dares to say no to Russia as well as the United States and Europe. He is simply the reincarnation of Saladin. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This has given Turkey a lot of points in its competition with Saudi Arabia and Iran to become the leader in the Middle East. Originally, due to the collapse of the Ottoman Empire, the fact that the Turks belong to the Turkic ethnic group rather than the Arab ethnic group, the pro-Western line implemented by Kemalism in the past few decades, and many other factors, Turkey was once marginalized in the Middle East world. Now it has finally been &quot;Egyptian&quot; Sudan” regained many scores. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2023, Turkey will make another move in the Transcaucasus: supporting Azerbaijan and forcing Armenia to withdraw from the &quot;Naka ​​region.&quot; This not only enabled Turkey and Azerbaijan to win the geopolitical dispute, but also caused Armenia to break away from Russia, its old master that it had relied on for hundreds of years, out of consideration for its own survival. This move caused Russia to lose serious points in the geopolitical conflict in the Transcaucasus. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After embarrassing Finland and Sweden for nearly a year and achieving its own political goals (Finland and Sweden agreed to weaken their support for the anti-Turkey Kurdish forces), Turkey approved Finland and Sweden’s applications to join NATO, and then Increased its influence in NATO and improved relations with the United States. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In October 2023, as the &quot;Hazra-Israeli conflict&quot; broke out in the Gaza Strip, Erdogan stood up to criticize Israel and criticized the United States and Europe, once again winning widespread support for him in the Middle East. Did he really want to revive the Ottoman Turkish Empire? How did he win so many times in a row over several years? This starts with Turkey’s political interests, cultural positioning, and geostrategy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Turkey’s national defense security depends on NATO, dominated by the United States, and its economic foundation mainly relies on the European market, dominated by the EU. In the modern world, it is simply impossible to allow Turkey to use force to retake the homeland of the former Ottoman Empire. Therefore, the main body of the secular and pro-Western concepts of &quot;Kemalism&quot; has not changed. Erdogan has worked hard for many years and always hopes to join the EU. When asked by the media whether he would go to the West or the East, he firmly answered: Go west and join the EU. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Turkey is also a country that has great conflicts with the West culturally. As a politician, Erdogan must decide his policies based on real social foundations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the early decades of the practice of &quot;Kemalism&quot;, Turkey adopted a one-sided strategy towards the West. But in the past decade or so, as the power of the Islamic world has increased, the Ankara authorities certainly cannot give up this huge resource. Therefore, they must strive for leadership in the Islamic world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the geostrategic level, Turkey has a unique advantage: as the strategic pillar of NATO in the southeast, it not only blocks the entrance and exit of the Black Sea, but also affects the security situation along the Black Sea coast and the Caspian Sea. The Transcaucasus and Central Asia have always been Russia&#39;s strategic soft belly, and Turkey has a profound influence on these two regions, whether in terms of geography, ethnicity, religion, culture, economy, etc. Turkey, which sits on the Anatolian Plateau, borders southeastern Europe to the west, Iran to the east, and the two river basins of Mesopotamia to the south. It plays a very important role. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Today, Erdogan has made comprehensive use of political, religious, cultural, economic, military, geographical and other factors to combine vertical and horizontal movements and maneuvers, and has achieved many successes and expanded Turkey. geopolitical interests. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But behind this set of seemingly prosperous actions, Turkey has serious problems: their economic size cannot support the talents and strategies of &quot;Egyptian Sudan&quot;. Its inflation is very serious. On October 26, the Central Bank of Turkey announced that it would raise the benchmark interest rate by 500 basis points from 30% to 35%. This is the fifth consecutive interest rate increase since the Central Bank entered the interest rate increase cycle in June. Since 2022, Turkey&#39;s inflation rate has been running at a high level, reaching 85.51% in October 2022, and 47.83%, 58.94%, and 61.53% in the three months of July, August, and September 2023, respectively, and there is still an upward trend. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Obviously, &quot;Egypt-Sudan&quot;, as a medium-sized country in Turkey, has done too many political achievements at a loss and made a profit, and all the costs have to be borne by the people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In history, many countries have adopted strategies of inciting nationalism, playing tricks at the top, and overdrafting national power. They have achieved jaw-dropping achievements in a relatively short period of time, but the results have mostly been tragic. The reason is simple: just like a person who is not in good health and has to exhaust his energy to run a marathon, triathlon, or decathlon, of course there will be no good results. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Currently, Erdogan is trying his best to control the pace of the game. After achieving his goals, he may compromise with the United States and Europe. For example: when Finland and Sweden were finally approved to join NATO, he chose to keep a low profile when the US military shot down a Turkish drone (in order to safeguard its interests with the Kurdish community). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After all, in terms of national defense, Turkey relies on the United States; in terms of economy, with such a high inflation rate, it depends even more on the help of the European Union, and it has a large number of immigrants and workers in Europe, which has a great impact on Ankara. The economy is very important, and it is also Turkey’s long-term means of ethnic penetration, colonization, and cultural expansion into Europe. Therefore, whether it is a show, a show, or a dispute or conflict, it must be stopped in moderation and not completely fall out with the West. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So, Erdogan is playing a medium-scale geostrategic game with Turkey&#39;s national power and influence. His intention is to use his territory spanning Europe and Asia, and his political and cultural involvement in the two camps of Europe and Islam, to jump on several ships to expand Turkey&#39;s influence in modern Europe and the Islamic world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 02 Nov 2023 23:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[官方通报女教师跳楼轻生事件：成立联合调查组，“加班数石榴”为不实信息]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259820]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-02 22:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;On October 27, 2023, a female teacher from Jianxing Road Primary School in our district unfortunately passed away.

Many domestic travel agencies have started selling Antarctic tour projects. The price of a trip is basically more than 100,000 yuan, and some high-end routes can be as high as 300,000 to 400,000 yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;For a long time, the Antarctic trip has been a niche high-end project. Many people don’t know about it. This is the first time for many people to hear that it is okay. Travel to Antarctica. Is traveling to Antarctica difficult and expensive? Is traveling to Antarctica a matter of spending money to enjoy the unique beauty, or is it &quot;spending money to buy suffering&quot;? Will many people traveling to Antarctica damage the ecological environment of Antarctica? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/31/Ry46lJqqtjt2vMlY9w62dFLPyCkmUXDliLD7DCL3.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/31/Ry46lJqqtjt2vMlY9w62dFLPyCkmUXDliLD7DCL3.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;256199&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（IC photo/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; >;&lt;strong>;Is it difficult to travel to Antarctica&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Antarctica is the southernmost point of the earth. It is the last one to be discovered on the earth and the only one without humans. A continent where people live and settle. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;For a long time in the past, Antarctica was a mysterious place in the world until Antarctica was discovered in 1820. Since then, Antarctica has also been mainly used as a scientific research base. In December 1911, the Norwegian Amundsen expedition reached the Antarctic Pole for the first time. In 1985, my country established a scientific research station in Antarctica for the first time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In fact, Antarctica is also a tourist destination. In the 1950s, the world&#39;s first international tourist group of 500 people went to Antarctica, and Antarctic tourism officially appeared. 2007 was the first year for China to launch Antarctic tourism, and China’s first officially recognized Antarctic tour line was completed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;According to statistics from the International Association of Antarctic Tourism Operators (IAATO), China is the second largest source of tourists to Antarctica. In the 2017-2018 Antarctic tourism season, a total of 51,707 tourists from around the world visited Antarctica, and the number of Chinese tourists reached 8,273, accounting for 16%, second only to the United States. A total of 1,464 Chinese people went to Antarctica in the 2022-23 Antarctic season. It is expected that in the 2023-24 Antarctic tourism season, Chinese tourists will return to 80% of the pre-epidemic number. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Antarctica does not have four seasons, only two seasons, namely the warm season (November-March) and the cold season (April-October). The warm season is also the tourist season in Antarctica, because it is almost daytime and the temperature is higher, making it more suitable for tourism. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Theoretically, as long as it is the Antarctic tourist season, everyone can travel to Antarctica, because traveling to Antarctica does not require a visa, and Antarctica does not belong to any nation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;From a practical point of view, traveling to Antarctica is difficult. After all, our country does not have direct commercial flights to Antarctica. Tourists must first go to a country relatively close to Antarctica. , such as Argentina, Australia or New Zealand, and then go to Antarctica via cruise ships or flights from these transit countries. Therefore, if you want to apply for a transit country visa when going to Antarctica, you also need the help and services of a professional travel company. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/31/bcdfUdi8XYsJEq5ytx0qk74142tITCWOEmb4Y18g.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;722&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/31/bcdfUdi8XYsJEq5ytx0qk74142tITCWOEmb4Y18g.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;256198&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（IC photo/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; >;&lt;strong>;欣赏美，或买罪受？ &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;可以想见，南极有着摄人心魄的美。南极大陆98%的地域终年为冰雪所覆盖，让人仿佛置身纯白的世界，从眼睛到心灵都无比澄澈透亮。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;在这里，游客会因大自然的鬼斧神工而颤栗，可以欣赏到永昼的自然景观，也可以与南极洲的主人们——企鹅、蓝鲸、海狮以及各种海鸥，和谐愉快地共处……&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;南极游可以给我们提供在世界上其他地方感受不到的独家体验。为了丰富旅途的乐趣，旅游公司也会在南极开展徒步、皮划艇和露营等户外活动。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;去南极欣赏美的背后，也需要支付很高的成本。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;漫长的旅程背后，是金钱消逝的声音。如今国内主流的南极游项目都是先从国内飞往阿根廷，再经由阿根廷坐邮轮去往南极，大部分邮轮的始发地都在阿根廷最南端的乌斯怀亚。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;从国内到阿根廷布宜诺斯艾利斯飞行全程约40小时（还得承受麻烦的转机），从阿根廷港口搭乘邮轮出海，要经历2天到5天不等的航行时间，方可抵达南极大陆。游客可以选择只在南极大陆玩几天；也可以选择“南极半岛+南极圈”，在南极半岛的基础上再向南航行一段穿过南极圈。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;一趟南极游下来，短的话十天左右，长的话可以二三十天。根据飞机舱位的不同、邮轮等级与住宿环境的不同，价格上也有很大的差异。比如各家邮轮公司的价格基本在每人60000—200000元人民币。由此，一趟南极游的总费用，便宜的要七八万，昂贵的要三四十万，甚至更高。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;南极游的挑战不仅仅在于价格贵，也在于旅途中很“受罪”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;抵达南极大陆的邮轮，基本上都要穿越德雷克海峡。这是世界上最宽的海峡，也是世界上最深的海峡，由于受极地旋风的影响，常年狂风巨浪，一年到头风力基本都在8级以上。邮轮穿越其间，船体不可避免要发生剧烈晃动，游客晕船+呕吐的发生概率极高，以至于有这样的说法，“没晕过一回德雷克海峡, 别说你去过南极”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;南极游的游客，对于这段旅程往往也就存在两极分化的评价。有的认为不虚此行，是人生中独一无二的经验，也有些人坦诚道，花钱买罪受，南极游“好冷、好远、好贵、好无聊”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;旅游会伤害南极吗&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;南极是世界公认的全人类共有的自然保护区，对于南极的保护也早就以国际公约的形式确定下来。 1959年12月1日，《南极条约》签订，1961年6月23日正式生效。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;《南极公约》旨在约束各国在南极洲这块地球上唯一一块没有常住人口的大陆上的活动，确保各国对南极洲的尊重。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;1991年，南极条约协商国特别会议针对南极的环境保护，通过了《关于环境保护的南极条约议定书》。中国作为协商国之一，签署了议定书。议定书为保护南极大陆及附近地区的生态环境免遭破坏制定了严格的保护措施。之后，国际南极旅游业者协会还出台了《南极旅游从业者活动指南》及《南极游客活动指南》。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;在这些条约的约束下，如今去南极旅游必须恪守一些原则，比如大船在某个地方停留不能超过5个小时；每次岛上只能登陆100人；不能主动靠近企鹅5米范围内；下船登陆、游玩返回上船都要清理鞋子，以避免生物侵袭，等等。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;只不过，气候灾难已经对南极生态产生严重的影响。随着地球的升温，南极冰川正在融化，也变得更加脆弱。研究表明，从1997年至2021年，逾四成南极洲冰架显著缩小。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;如今人类频繁的旅游活动，或让南极的雪化更快了。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;去年，《自然-通讯》（Nature Communications）上发表的一篇论文指出，南极洲的游客抵达点的黑碳污染，可能会增加这些地区的融雪。化石燃料和生物质燃料燃烧会产生黑碳，这些黑碳会吸收光线，让大气升温。如果黑碳落在雪上，融雪便会加快。于是，环境保护者大声疾呼：请减少非必要的南极游，请保护自然生态。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;尴尬的是，国内不少推出南极游项目的公司，宣传南极游的理由之一是，“部分南极冰川正在加速融化，失去了原貌的自然美。越早去，难能看到最原始的南极大陆，挽留即将消失的美丽与原始！”可恰恰越来越多游客的到访，在加剧南极冰雪的融化，在破坏南极的美。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;这倒不是说要把南极游都取消掉，人与自然是可以和谐共处的。只是，确实有必要加快清洁能源在南极游过程中的使用，限制游客数量，加强对南极旅游的监管，强化南极条约等的落实，从而尽可能减少人类在南极活动对南极生态的负面影响。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 02 Nov 2023 21:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[威马破产重整，车主面临“售后难”：购置电车须评估六大风险]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259689]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-02 20:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;According to the National Enterprise Bankruptcy and Reorganization Case Information Network, WM Motor Technology Group Co., Ltd. has applied for bankruptcy and reorganization WM Motor&#39;s official Weibo issued a notification letter in response, saying that the company still has salvage value and hopes to actively save itself by adjusting corporate strategies, solving financial debt problems, and getting investors to participate in restructuring and development. However, according to feedback from many WM owners, in early 2023, WM supporting software frequently experienced failures such as &quot;unable to connect, network abnormality&quot; and so on. In response to this, WM Motor publicly responded: &quot;Currently, WM Motor&#39;s engine system has returned to normal, and we sincerely apologize for the inconvenience caused to everyone!&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Judging from the current situation, if we cannot wait for the &quot;White Horse Rider&quot; &quot;Once WM Motor goes bankrupt, more than 100,000 car owners will face a &quot;complete shutdown&quot; of their vehicle systems. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The main components of electric vehicles have changed from the engine and gearbox of previous fuel vehicles to three-electric systems. In the electric vehicle maintenance market, new energy vehicle-related product technologies and parts supply are all mastered In the hands of OEMs and EMC manufacturers, independent repairers rarely participate. This means that when electric vehicle companies such as WM Motor are eliminated due to factors such as fierce market competition, the after-sales service chain will be broken, and car owners will not be able to find corresponding substitutes in the market. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The experience of a Weimar owner is a typical example. The power battery of the WM EX5 car he purchased malfunctioned. When it was charged to 80%, it would automatically jump to 100%. When the remaining 20% ​​of power was used, the car would stop moving. Because it was still within the manufacturer&#39;s warranty period, the car owner drove the car to the Kuangshan store of Jinan Weima User Center for repair. It still has not been repaired in nearly half a year because the manufacturer did not provide spare parts. The car owner contacted the 4S store again, and the 4S store said that it could no longer operate and asked him to tow the car away and solve the problem himself. The car owner also complained to the manufacturer many times, but it has not been resolved. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Weima owners are facing &quot;after-sales difficulties&quot;, which reveals that electric cars are not as beautiful as the owners imagined. Due to strong policy support, China&#39;s electric vehicle industry has developed rapidly. The latest statistics released by the Ministry of Public Security show that the number of electric vehicles in China currently exceeds 18 million. However, with the rapid development of electric vehicles, there are still six major risks. In addition to the difficulties encountered by Weimar owners mentioned above, they also involve aspects such as cruising range, charging, vehicle safety, data and privacy, and assisted driving. When buying a car, car owners must not Not aware. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some electric vehicle manufacturers deliberately exaggerate the cruising range of their vehicles in order to promote sales. According to a report by China Times in March this year, most new energy vehicle 4S stores marked the NEDC comprehensive working condition (driving cycle test) cruising range and did not mark the actual cruising range. Mr. Liu, an online ride-hailing driver, told a reporter from China Times that an electric car he mentioned in May 2022 had a range of 505 kilometers, but in actual driving, whether it was driving on the highway or in the city, , the cruising range can only reach about 300 kilometers, and in winter it only has more than 200 kilometers, and once it even &quot;slumped down&quot; on the highway. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The cruising range is not worthy of its name, and electric vehicles charge slowly, often taking six to eight hours to fully charge. This greatly affects the consumer experience. Especially when there is an urgent need for a car, long charging time will make consumers feel very inconvenient. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this regard, electric vehicle companies have provided two options. One is the DC fast charging mode, which takes 1 to 1.5 hours. However, frequent use of fast charging mode will affect battery life. Therefore, current electric vehicles still mainly rely on AC slow charging. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Secondly, some car companies provide battery swapping models, but the costs for car owners are high. At the same time, the investment cost of battery swapping stations is high and the number of built ones is limited. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The safety of electric vehicles is another major pain point that consumers are concerned about. In recent years, there have been many accidents involving spontaneous combustion of electric vehicles, posing a serious threat to the life and property safety of car owners. Statistics from the emergency management department show that in the first quarter of 2023 alone, the spontaneous combustion rate of electric vehicles increased by 32%, with an average of 8 electric vehicles catching fire (including spontaneous combustion) every day. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One of the directions for the intelligentization of electric vehicles is digitization. Electric vehicles can not only collect the owner’s face data through the in-car camera, but may also collect information such as the owner’s place of residence, whereabouts, and consumption places. , once such data is leaked by car companies or stolen by hackers, it will cause more serious consequences. According to a notice issued by the Maine Attorney General&#39;s Office in August this year, Tesla&#39;s data breach in May affected more than 75,000 people, including records related to employees. The incident originated from &quot;internal Employee misconduct”. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The application of assisted driving technology in electric vehicles will bring more problems. Some car companies refer to assisted driving technology as &quot;assisted autonomous driving&quot; or &quot;autonomous assisted driving&quot;. Sales staff will hype it up when promoting, beautifying it as &quot;autonomous driving&quot;. If there is an accident, it will become &quot;assisted driving&quot;. . The assisted driving technology used by many electric vehicles currently has a paradox in itself. It not only advocates liberating the driver, but also requires the driver to supervise and be ready to take over anytime and anywhere. If an accident occurs, how to divide the responsibilities between the driver and the car company? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some of the six major risks associated with electric vehicles may be improved as technology advances, while others may remain unresolved for a long time. Therefore, when people buy electric vehicles, they must not be concerned about the risks promoted by car companies. &quot;Environmental protection&quot; (the degree of environmental pollution caused by batteries is not low) and &quot;intelligence&quot; are fully accepted, but it is still necessary to evaluate rationally and objectively before deciding whether to place an order. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 02 Nov 2023 20:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[国务院印发《关于取消和调整一批罚款事项的决定》]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259818]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-02 19:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;In order to further optimize the business environment, the State Council recently issued the &quot;Decision on Cancellation and Adjustment of a Group of Fines&quot; ( (hereinafter referred to as the &quot;Decision&quot;), 33 fines were canceled and adjusted in the fields of industry, information technology, housing and urban-rural construction, among which 16 fines were canceled and 17 fines were adjusted.

The purpose of cancellation and adjustment is to effectively reduce the burden on enterprises and the people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The cancellation and adjustment of fines involve a total of 7 administrative regulations and 6 departmental regulations. The &quot;Decision&quot; puts forward clear requirements for the legislative work after the cancellation and adjustment of fines. Relevant departments of the State Council must submit relevant administrative regulations modification plans to the State Council within 60 days from the date of issuance of the &quot;Decision&quot; and complete the modification and abolition of relevant departmental regulations. If departmental regulations need to be adjusted according to the revised administrative regulations, the modification and abolition must be completed within 60 days from the date of promulgation of the relevant administrative regulations. Considering that there is a 30-day period for soliciting opinions on the modification and abolition of departmental regulations, it is stipulated that if the modification or abolition of departmental regulations cannot be completed within the above period due to special reasons, it may be appropriately extended, but the extension period shall not exceed 30 days at most. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Decision&quot; emphasizes that after the fines are cancelled, the relevant departments must study carefully in accordance with the law, strictly implement regulatory responsibilities, focus on strengthening supervision during and after the event, improve supervision methods, standardize supervision procedures, and improve the scientific and scientific nature of supervision. Simplicity and precision further enhance regulatory efficiency and provide strong support for promoting high-quality development. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 02 Nov 2023 19:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[“丑小鸭”的生长：一所学校防治青少年抑郁的探索与思考]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259838]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-02 17:58:46&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 11/01/epeeemYXf9dkI727T4PbzTs2ff4ZarA2VMg8Hxh4.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1578&quot; height=&quot;1106&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/epeeemYXf9dkI727T4PbzTs2ff4Z arA2VMg8Hxh4. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256486&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On October 19, 2023, girls confided and comforted each other on the playground of Ugly Duckling Middle School &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern People Weekly reporter Weng Huan/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Did you want to come here on your own, or were you &#39;tricked&#39; by your parents?&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Half and half. When I came here, I realized, hey, it&#39;s not at all what I thought.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Under the bright sun, more than a dozen buses and minibuses were parked here. The mountainside of Ruixing Village in Yiliang, Kunming. Hundreds of people filed in, lingering in the classrooms, student dormitories, book bars, and running tracks of this rural school, observing carefully, even the bathrooms painted with paint. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Visitors include principals, moral education directors, classroom teachers from all over the country, officials and entrepreneurs from the local education sector, social organizations engaged in family education and private innovative education, as well as some who “can’t figure it out” in their own families. Parents worried about their children. They were curious about how a school called &quot;Ugly Duckling Middle School&quot; could help a group of children who seemed to be surly, tired of studying, or even suffering from deep depression to blossom into a natural and brilliant life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For these questions, the &quot;ugly duckling&quot; principal Zhan Danian always smiles and does not answer immediately. In the 13 years since he founded this school, various questions and controversies have continued, which he no longer thinks is strange. But he did not expect that the youth depression problem that he had deeply realized in running the school would actually trigger a strong response after launching the &quot;First Youth Psychological Safety Forum&quot; (jointly with the China Education Thirty Forum), and the reverberation continues to this day. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;2023 China Mental Health&quot; Blue Book released on October 10, 2023 shows that 40% of Chinese teenagers feel lonely, the depression detection rate among high school students is 40%, and the depression detection rate among junior high school students is 40%. is 50%, and the risk of mild anxiety among college students is 38%. Peng Kaiping, dean of the Academy of Social Sciences of Tsinghua University, once wrote an article pointing out that today&#39;s Chinese teenagers have &quot;four no&#39;s&quot;: no interest in learning, no interest in the real world, no ability to deal with the real society, and no interest in life. Therefore, the theme of this forum has been upgraded from the previously mentioned &quot;youth mental health&quot; to &quot;psychological safety&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/BcDl53HOeKhBlcjWZsACyCKlrhO9mJTFm3q4LvX9.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;546&quot; height= &quot;364&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/BcDl53HOeKhBlcjWZsACyCKlrhO9mJTFm3q4LvX9.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256482&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In the psychology room of Ugly Duckling Middle School, teacher Li Guihong (middle) performs sand table psychotherapy for students. Some students also sit quietly and relax here&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;( Southern People Weekly reporter Weng Huan/picture) &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Zhan Danian’s view, depression is just a symptom, and behind it are the flaws in the current educational ecology. &quot;The essence of education is to develop students&#39; personalities, rather than using a ruler to measure students. The best and most equitable education should be education that adapts to students&#39; personalities, so that every student&#39;s potential can be developed.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We have actually heard this argument too many times. The key is how to put it into practice. Therefore, in the &quot;wild education&quot; of the &quot;ugly duckling&quot;, is there really any experience that can be discovered and learned from to prevent and treat depression in teenagers? What kind of social and family symptoms are behind every depressed child? Are they definitely unsolvable? Our reporters went to Kunming and Yiliang to explore the possibility of dispelling the shadow of education under the sun. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/cnGVQpHqsTRAN5BW8PNj5Om1pOjzY81isic8ZjO9.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;545&quot; height= &quot;364&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/cnGVQpHqsTRAN5BW8PNj5Om1pOjzY81isic8ZjO9.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256483&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;At 11:30 in the morning, the students of Ugly Duckling Middle School were having physical education class. Students in this school have about 3 hours of outdoor exercise time every day&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern People Weekly reporter Weng Huan/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot; It’s all my fault”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Pu Pu actually loves to laugh. But in the crowd, with her dark face, ponytail, and big black-rimmed glasses, she didn&#39;t often make a sound. On a 30℃ day, my body is still huddled in a collared sweater and a jacket. When you open your mouth, the sound coming out of the braces is very soft, like a porcelain bowl that is afraid of breaking. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I noticed her in class. In the Chinese class of teacher Juanjuan in the second grade of junior high school, Pu Pu raised her hand, which surprised me, who initially thought she would not want to speak. But two minutes later, she lowered her head and body, and closed her eyes, as if everything around her had nothing to do with her. This state of affairs occurs constantly in the classroom. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;It&#39;s a reaction after taking medicine.&quot; Psychology teacher Li Guihong told me. When he first arrived at &quot;The Ugly Duckling&quot;, Pu Pu had to take more than 20 pills of medication to treat mental illness at a time, but now the medication has been reduced by more than half. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;More than two years ago, Pu Pu was in the first grade of junior high school in Kunming, a middle school known for its academic performance. Like other branches of this education group, almost nothing is allowed here that is not related to study. It is strictly forbidden to move or talk during meals and lunch breaks. If you are &quot;disobedient&quot;, the dormitory aunt will record your name, deduct points, and scold you. Pu Pu once had his name recorded because he took a few minutes longer to take a shower. He got a little excited while chatting with his classmates at noon, so he was also recorded. &quot;The punishment is a slap on the palm, but it doesn&#39;t hurt. There is also running, which requires many laps.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Don&#39;t you think this kind of management is a bit strict?&quot; I asked her. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;It doesn&#39;t count. I broke the rules in the first place, and it&#39;s all my fault.&quot; She answered quietly in the rest area next to the &quot;Ugly Duckling&quot; playground. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After reading for a while, Pu Pu began to suffer from insomnia and developed delusional symptoms. &quot;Sometimes I feel happy, and sometimes I feel uncomfortable. When I feel uncomfortable, I can&#39;t control myself and scream loudly.&quot; She asked her parents to see a psychiatrist. Later, she was diagnosed with &quot;depression and anxiety disorder&quot; and was admitted to the hospital. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Pu Pu’s parents run a dental clinic and are very caring towards her. &quot;During the time I was hospitalized, my father was at work and my mother often stayed with me in the hospital.&quot; She had undergone MECT (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 毷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;non-convulsive electroshock&lt;/span>; ) and transcranial magnetism (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;physical device that stimulates brain nerves&lt;/span>;) treatments, except for dizziness and numbness, did not have much effect. Pu Pu dropped out of school. In the past two years, she gained weight due to medication and other reasons. Her heaviest weight was close to 70 kilograms. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/TJoN8oef5Juq9tWKgF4rQvSNw2dkpGJCEAFagyfE.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;449&quot; height= &quot;337&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/TJoN8oef5Juq9tWKgF4rQvSNw2dkpGJCEAFagyfE.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256485&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Aerial view of the Ugly Duckling Middle School campus&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern People Weekly reporter Weng Huan/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p >;Bad moods still came up from time to time like a tide. When she couldn&#39;t stand it anymore, Pu Pu would hit her head against the wall, cry, and pinch her throat with her hands... More than once, she wanted to open the window and jump. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are other ways. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Rolling up her sleeves, Pu Pu’s arms, from palm to elbow, were densely covered with new flesh that was a minute or two thicker than the original skin after twenty or thirty cuts with a knife, like a row. Light-colored thorns winding up. There are several more in the middle, which are longer, deeper, and redder in color. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Does it hurt when you paddle?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;No.&quot; She shook her head and smiled. &quot;Seeing blood relieves stress.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In those late nights when she couldn&#39;t get through it, patients she met while she was in the hospital sent her messages and asked her to try other methods, such as scratching paper, throwing stuffed toys, and picking at the wall. &quot;They also advised me not to think about (suicide) so much. Some (symptoms) are milder than yours, and some are more severe than yours. You will definitely get better slowly.&quot; After hearing these kind words of comfort, Pu Pu would stop. &quot;I actually don&#39;t believe what they said. But when I think about how hard it was for my parents to give birth to and raise me, I can&#39;t just give up.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;You still think that suffering from mental illness is all a matter of Is it my own problem?&quot; I asked her again. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Well... I didn&#39;t adjust my mentality well. I used to have low self-esteem. I didn&#39;t like my skin being so dark. It turned out that my classmates at school called me &#39;black girl&#39;. I was unhappy and also I keep it in my heart.&quot; She raised her head and opened her eyes: &quot;But I am optimistic now. I don&#39;t think there is any problem with being black. And my mother said that there are many medical beauty methods now. If I want, I can also have whitening when I grow up. .&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A year ago, Pu Pu was sent as an &quot;ugly duckling&quot;. &quot;She didn&#39;t like to laugh very much and couldn&#39;t integrate into the group.&quot; During the &quot;attack&quot;, she trembled all over and pulled her hair, causing two people to suffer. Only then can she be held back. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Both Zhan Danian and Li Guihong said that adults need to pay attention to children&#39;s paddling and &quot;self-injury&quot;, but do not need to be too frightened. &quot;Some are seeking stimulation, some are subconscious, and some are emotional releases. They may want you to see it. What you have to do is to give them enough understanding and protection.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For various physical symptoms and stress In response, Li Guihong recorded her experience in the industry for more than ten years in a notebook, as well as some practices she learned from Liu Zhiyou, a special psychological consultant for &quot;The Ugly Duckling&quot; and a Taiwanese brain science expert: when dealing with children with trembling hands and feet, first touch them gently. If they have violent behaviors such as hitting the wall, you can give them electrolyte water and touch other parts of the body. After the child calmed down a little, she also taught the student the &quot;Flat Throwing Kung Fu&quot;: half-squatting, slowly shaking both hands up and down. Sometimes she would also give the children some lemon slices, &quot;I said eating this will make them feel better quickly, and psychological suggestions can also work.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images. infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/CpuvdptotWQHlYpaDKBAVn7smjmQGGQ6cJciqfkk.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;441&quot; height=&quot;294&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/ medias/image/23/11/01/CpuvdptotWQHlYpaDKBAVn7smjmQGGQ6cJciqfkk.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256484&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Ugly Duckling Middle School Boys Dormitory&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern People Weekly reporter Weng Huan/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During class time and after class in the afternoon, students will always enter the first floor in twos and threes. This psych room on the left. They hugged the big furry bears on the sofas and cushions; some would chat with &quot;Lao Li&quot; - this is their pet name for Li Guihong; some spent half an hour drawing mandoles in the cubicle. Luo (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;A painting therapy invented by psychologist Jung&lt;/span>;). &quot;Old Li, why haven&#39;t my paintings been hung up?&quot; A child said, half coquettishly and half angrily. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;How about you draw a more interesting one? I will consider it later.&quot; Li Guihong secretly told me, asking whether this child is a student specializing in art. &quot;I have to give other children more opportunities.&quot; I suddenly remembered that when I visited the girls&#39; dormitory on the first day, there were several girls on the upper bunk with their legs curled up and their heads raised, painting, and one of them was Pu Pu. In the &quot;Ugly Duckling&quot;, all greening and interior and exterior decorations are completed by students according to their own wishes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;No one seems to regard this psychological room with warm colors as a therapeutic place. It has naturally become a transfer station, chat room and tea room for emotional flow. &quot;They are willing to come here for no particular purpose. They can relax and clear their minds. That&#39;s good.&quot; Li Guihong said. When encountering a child like Pu Pu who needs special treatment, if she is willing to chat, she and her colleague Yang Haoming will divide the work; if not, the first thing to do is still: give time and wait. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Only when the child&#39;s emotions are relatively intense and several people have &#39;attacks&#39; at the same time, I feel a little powerless.&quot; She smiled, &quot;But there are other teachers who can take turns to deal with it, so don&#39;t be afraid.&quot;&lt;/p>; p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/vMJ3G8t4amWuAREHAtZnY6sTReZXiQLvcCYK1bfb.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;441&quot; height=&quot;297 &quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/vMJ3G8t4amWuAREHAtZnY6sTReZXiQLvcCYK1bfb.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256488&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: # 999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Students are reading beside the bookshelf at the entrance of the classroom.

She is recovering well now.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When some children first arrived, they were arrogant and said, &quot;Thinking that everything is other people&#39;s.&quot; It’s their fault. They often feel excluded and isolated from the entire world, and tend to avoid social interactions.” Some of these students may have already constructed or are forming their own worldview and set of behavioral logic. They are like big rocks on the cliff, shining brightly, but also easy to fall, and need the support of the big trees on the cliff. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tian Lan is one of them. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hearing that I wanted to chat with him in the military training class, Tian Lam’s eyes lit up as he shuffled slowly: “YES!” Later I learned that as long as there was no class, he would secretly happy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Entering the large conference room on the first floor, only the two of us were left. Tian Lan sat down in an almost &quot;Ge You lying&quot; posture without any restraint. When faced with many questions, he would pause for five or six seconds before slowly spitting out his answer. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When the topic involved emotions and &quot;depression&quot;, he seemed to be waking up from a dream, &quot;Then why are you looking for me -&quot; I thought the conversation was about to reach a deadlock, but he said again: &quot; This needs to be traced back all the way...even though I am only 14 years old, it has already run through my short life.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tian Lan grew up in a provincial capital city in the south of the Yangtze River. A year or two before coming to the &quot;Ugly Duckling&quot;, he dropped out of school for six months and was stuck at home without ever leaving the house. Watching videos and reading novels. The longest time I stayed awake was more than fifty hours. He originally weighed 140 pounds, but lost dozens of pounds because he only had one meal in a day or two. &quot;It&#39;s not nutritious, even my nails are only cut once a month.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Unbeknownst to him, he refused to hear any sound at that time, would explode whenever he heard a sound, and would not let his father live at home. &quot;I just drove him away. They say &#39;filial piety comes first&#39;, but I actually beat my parents. I couldn&#39;t help it. After the beating, my mother cried, and I cried with her.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A psychiatrist was also found. Yes, come to see a doctor. Tian Lan didn&#39;t accept any of it. &quot;The questions they asked were very boring, and I couldn&#39;t see anything credible from them.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Day and night are reversed, lifeless. At that time, Tian Lan&#39;s only thought was &quot;stay at home until the age of 18 and then die.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What happened before that? I asked him several times. He frowned and fell into memories, &quot;I can&#39;t tell.&quot; From childhood to junior high school, the memory puzzle was full of cracks. The description of the past is mixed with recognition, resentment, reflection, and more confusion. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tian Lan’s father is a middle-level cadre of a state-owned enterprise, and his mother takes care of him full-time. The relationship with them cannot be said to be very bad, nor can it be said to be very good. When he was about 10 years old, his piano teacher scolded him fiercely because he made a mistake in practicing the piano, &quot;and even threw the milk out.&quot; After passing the level 10 piano test, he said, &quot;I never want to touch this thing again.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Just read it In the first year of junior high school, he was in a well-known foreign language school in the provincial capital, and his classmates seemed to be better than him. &quot;There were only 9 classes in the whole grade at that time, and I was in class 2109. But they said I was in class 10. Everyone was having fun, except me. I suspected that I had a neurological problem. Why can others socialize but I can&#39;t?&quot;&lt; /p>; &lt;p>;Tian Lan longed for a friend, but the result was zero. Then he didn&#39;t want to do his homework anymore. &quot;My mother said you can do whatever you want.&quot; He didn&#39;t go to school for a month. Man, completely wilted. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Half a year after dropping out of school, he entered a local &quot;closed school&quot; under military management (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 毷体, 毷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Special Training School&lt;/p>; span>;). &quot;Yes, it&#39;s like XX Academy.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Strict control is not important. I hate the underworld.&quot; He emphasized. In Tian Lan’s description, the school is very popular (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 毷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Two sounds, meaning deceitful&lt;/span>;), &quot;teachers, gangsters&quot; They all bully others and hit them wherever they want. The boys&#39; class doesn&#39;t treat others as human beings. There are surveillance cameras everywhere just for parents to see. Even if they wipe their noses during assembly, they can be pulled to the stairwell.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When I first arrived at the closed school, my limb functions deteriorated a bit because I stayed at home for too long: my fingers were weak and my eyes couldn’t focus. After a few periods of military class, he heard two &quot;clicks&quot; from his knees and fell to the playground. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After five days like this, the instructor and classmates thought he was faking. &quot;I went to the village hospital to take a picture. I fractured my knee, and the doctor took a picture of my calf!&quot; He said with a &quot;bewildered&quot; expression. When he went to see the doctor for a follow-up visit, there were many teachers beside the car taking him to the hospital, but no one helped him pull the wheelchair or push him into the car. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;The whole world is sick. I am also sick.&quot; He smiled habitually. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;How could you stay in such an environment for 8 months? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I later learned to tolerate it. Not long after I arrived, I complained to my dad and begged him to take me away. He just smiled. But you know, I have been in a closed school for a long time. , I even feel a little warm! I have found a little feeling of home.&quot; He himself couldn&#39;t believe this mentality. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before and after the school was closed, he attended several other schools. Tian Lan was amazed at &quot;How come the world has become so weird in just over a year&quot;: &quot;Some schools are eager to learn all the contents of junior high school as soon as they are promoted from primary school to junior high school. Some even don&#39;t have enough time to go to the toilet and don&#39;t understand. Every day before the exam They all talked about test papers. Didn’t my mother tell the teacher at the new school that I had a fracture? The frostbite pustules on my hands left in the closed school have not gone away for a year. The teacher asked, didn’t you have a fracture? You were resting at home, so what are you doing? Will there be frostbite?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This heart is not completely dead. What Tian Lan wants to learn most is Go. His best result is amateur fifth-dan: it is no exaggeration to say that 99% of ordinary people are no longer his opponents in Go. &quot;You don&#39;t have to think about sixth-dan. I will be among the top three in provincial and municipal competitions. I think I have some talent. But what&#39;s the use of passing the exam?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images .infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/yb5knYK1H5M5xPYAGDUsjuZwJWyvrG62KRQXEuVY.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;443&quot; height=&quot;297&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms /medias/image/23/11/01/yb5knYK1H5M5xPYAGDUsjuZwJWyvrG62KRQXEuVY.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256487&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Students decorate with brushes Girls dormitory &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern People Weekly reporter Weng Huan/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He liked Liu Cixin and listened to &quot;The Three-Body Problem&quot; using podcast software when he dropped out of school , I love reading &quot;Supernova Era&quot; and many other short stories. &quot;Have you ever heard of &quot;Genshin Impact&quot; (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 毷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;an open world role-playing game&lt;/span>;)?

My uncle and aunt were very strict with my cousin, but during the COVID-19 epidemic, the two brothers still had fun in the countryside of their hometown. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“The house in my hometown is big, with a mountain behind it. The top of the mountain was cut in half, and a slope protruded from the cliff. We cut down the weeds, built steps, and dug many holes. After the grass grew, we repaired it ourselves. Let&#39;s call it the &#39;Temple of Earth&#39;, haha. That&#39;s our &#39;Hundred Garden&#39;.&quot; He grinned for the first time in the two hours of chatting. &quot;There is a big pond in the back mountain. We use a big net to catch fish, and there are a lot of shrimps and crabs. There are many flowers, plants and trees on the path over the pond, which is fun.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But the last time I saw my cousin, In his eyes, the other person has &quot;grown up&quot;, his voice has changed, and he is a little unfamiliar, &quot;We can&#39;t play together anymore.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Guihong feels that Tian Lan&#39;s understanding of people and the world is narrow. &quot;But he is a child with a strong sense of justice and cannot hold a grain of sand in his eyes. So he will have his own expectations and requirements for the environment.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is why Tian Lan feels that, compared to others, The &quot;ugly duckling&quot; whose place is already much better will still have situations where &quot;small groups&quot; &quot;bully the weak&quot; that he can&#39;t stand.

Some of them had mild or obvious symptoms of depression when they entered school, and some had already been diagnosed with depression or anxiety and took medication to enroll. There are also some &quot;problem students&quot; who may have nothing to do with &quot;depression&quot; but are troublesome to the original school or parents and difficult to discipline. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhan Danian, the founder of &quot;Ugly Duckling&quot;, does not accept this labeling term. In his eyes, every child does not have any big problems. They just cannot adapt to the teaching methods and evaluation standards of traditional education, and encounter various obstacles in getting along with their families, teachers, and peers. &quot;I even feel that in the era of ChatGPT, these so-called &#39;problem children&#39; are more creative and more hopeful.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1981, Zhan Danian, a native of Yiyang, Hunan Province, graduated from a normal college at the age of 26. Became the youngest principal in Taojiang County. During his tenure, the rural school that originally had just over a hundred students expanded into a medium-sized school with over a thousand students. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But after working in the system for nearly 20 years, Zhan Danian decided to resign. After that, he came to Yunnan and participated in the establishment of two private schools. Until 2011, he founded the Ugly Duckling Middle School with his wife Yang Liufang and several colleagues, and made it his lifelong ambition. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;My leaving the system has nothing to do with courage, but with personal choice.&quot; He emphasized again and again. &quot;Our educational environment places too much emphasis on &#39;picking the best and chasing the poor&#39;. Once the children do not do well, they seem to have no future. The value of education is to develop people, how can it become the elimination of people? I want to give myself and those who are not valued and The caring children find a way out.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhan Danian&#39;s Mandarin has a strong Yiyang accent, and he once said with a smile that &quot;the voice software cannot recognize it.&quot; But this man with a face like Maitreya and a slightly bulging belly has become a powerful activist in innovative education. Over the years, he has blazed a path that seems to be a &quot;deviant path&quot; but is actually a &quot;passenger path&quot; that is extremely difficult to imitate. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In &quot;Ugly Duckling&quot;, students generally enroll for as little as 5 months and as long as more than two years, and will study courses from the first to the third grade of junior high school. Zhan Danian hopes that after they study here for about 10 months, their behavior and habits will return to normal and they can handle their interpersonal relationships normally, and then he will persuade them to return to their original school. &quot;After all, it is more convenient to go back to study with your parents. Its mission is not to let the children enter high school first, but to live a normal life or even survive.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the year when the school was founded, Zhan Danian&#39;s good friend, Wang Yeju, deputy director of the Culture and History Committee of the Yunnan Provincial Committee of the CPPCC, named the school &quot;Ugly Duckling&quot;. Many people couldn&#39;t understand it. Some freshmen also thought it was &quot;very earthy&quot;, but Zhan Danian felt like he had found a treasure: &quot;The duckling may be eaten by others, but the ugly duckling may be eaten by others.&quot; I will definitely be able to fly in one day!&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many of the so-called &quot;problem children&quot; are accompanied by social and psychological problems.但在最初一些年里，詹大年和同事们并未发觉和意识到问题的严重。直到2021年，学校内部的一次心理测评，九十多名在校学生里，有71名被评定为“重度抑郁”。他开始认真地审视这一问题，并多次在私人公众号和其他场合发声。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“我想让更多人了解青少年抑郁，抑郁是可以治疗的。但我们更应该去了解孩子的心声。他们不应该被边缘化。”来宜良前，他在电话里郑重地告诉我。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;出行前，我曾拜托他先分享几个抑郁学生的“案例”。他笑了笑，“讲谁合适呢？还是你来后随意和孩子们交谈吧。他们每个人的经历都可以书写百万字的小说。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;深秋的季节，从昆明出发不到一个小时车程后进入宜良县，沿南盘江逆流而上，经过一路的三角梅和灌木丛，鼻间开始弥漫着鸡鸭屎的“香味”和满村烧秸秆的烟气。岔路口立着一块“丑小鸭中学”的路牌指向目的地的方向。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;丑小鸭的原址就坐落在宜良北古城镇，交通便利。但因校舍年久失修，两年多前，詹大年带领大家将学校迁到了海拔1800多米的新址。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;步入教学楼，一层走廊的木质栏窗、书柜和满墙斜挂着的吉他映入眼帘。木头取自本地的杉树，木材不贵，却挺拔好看。 “都是孩子们跟我们一起建造的。”詹大年介绍。窗外的樟树、天竺葵，窗台上的珊瑚樱、观音莲、绿公主、铂金蔓绿绒，一盆盆层层叠叠的绿，甚为喜人。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;看似普通，却有着全中国多数学校望尘莫及的“优越”条件：年均2100多小时的日照。 10月份的白天，背对太阳不过几分钟便觉微热。来此参观的教育界人士朱小毛没忍住，拿着三本书作枕头，直接躺在了操场的地上。 “不躺都是一种浪费。一所有阳光的学校，才能真正温暖人心。”朱小毛慨叹。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/q3ntqxMMAWsWkelyuY6CHwcPdvtJ1WtIcSCfdPUa.jpg&quot;

&lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;2023年10月，丑小鸭中学的一节心理课，学生在就“青春萌动”话题发表看法&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（南方人物周刊记者翁洹/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;早上的晨跑，上午40分钟的体育课，加上下午40分钟的军训课，“每天我们至少保证三个小时的户外运动，还不包括孩子们的自由活动时间。”詹大年自豪地说起，副校长杨柳芳接着介绍：“到冬天大中午的时候，孩子们经常就躺在这里（&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;操场的防腐木舞台&lt;/span>;）看书聊天，可舒服了。学校会安排人把这些木板拖洗干净，方便他们&#39;躺平&#39;。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;走廊上的钢琴，学生们下课可随意弹奏。教室集中在二层，一共只有七、八、九年级共三间，每间都很开阔：前半部分是课堂，后半部被书架做成的玄关隔开，只放了一两排桌子，供学生讨论、活动。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;除了校长夫妇、创校不久便来的向国跃、李桂红和“龙哥”，老师们都很年轻，好几次我都把老师错当成了学生交谈。 “在这儿看不到多少老师的痕迹。没有校服，也没有制服。”詹大年说。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但教室墙面上用水笔书写的课表上，却活脱脱全是“老师”的存在：娟娟、波波、自富——教授者的昵称取代了课程名。黑板也被几乎整面墙的白板代替，顺滑，超大。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“丑小鸭”倡导全科教学。这里的文化课只有三门：文科、理科和英语。文科老师负责语文、历史、政治三科教学；理科老师负责数理化三科。 “大多数来的孩子，就是自信被伤害，关系被破坏，甚至人格被解体。如果科目老师一周只有一两节课的时间和学生接触，一个学期下来都没法熟悉学生，很难有我们期待的那种生命交融。只有尽可能多地接触孩子，才能够建立教育应有的&#39;关系&#39;。”詹大年解释。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;初二的语文课上，有同学提问，“娟娟，今天我们能开&#39;小火车&#39;吗？”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“可以啊！”接下来，学生们一个个次第起立，如多米诺一般，每人朗读完一句刚学过的古文《与朱元思书》便自行翻译，下一个亦复如是——这是大家乐此不疲的游戏。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“嘿，你怎么抢断别人车厢？”娟娟嗤的一笑，却并无责怪。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“那个谁，你今天刚到是吧？”她对一位坐在最后排、有些扭捏的新生讲，“我们有&#39;新生保护期&#39;，这个问题你可以不回答。期待你后面的表现哦。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在“丑小鸭”，学生几乎每节文化课都会用平板电脑查资料，接着再交还老师；下课后，可以用教室的触摸屏欣赏音乐、看看短视频；一周还有一两天晚上有自由上网的“福利”——当然，还是平板。手机，除非请假回家探亲，平时严禁使用。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“网瘾大，不用手机受不了？”似乎没人这么觉得。每天下午两节文化课后，学生除了参加军训，还有两节兴趣课和社团活动：吉他、舞蹈、声乐、篮球。不用固定，想上哪个都可以。实在没有感兴趣的，打牌、弹琴、看书，和人聊天，打打沙袋，在操场遛弯儿，都行。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;每个月的3日、13日和23日，是村里的“街天”（&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;赶集日&lt;/span>;）。生活老师会带着学生走出校门，出去赶集。 “什么豆浆油条，米饼、苦荞饼、葱油饼，饼干山楂卷，酸辣凤爪，百香果味道的，什么好吃的都有。”初二女生季果儿跟我描述着，馋虫仿佛已顺着嘴边冒了出来。 “有时周末，老师还会带我们去县城泡温泉，吃烧烤、火锅，还有露营。可好玩呢。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/87mzFhHs2aAVvAn0lrtqpq7ngfD3U1EC1lnciydw.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;538&quot; height=&quot;348&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/87mzFhHs2aAVvAn0lrtqpq7ngfD3U1EC1lnciydw.jpg&quot;

&lt;p>;“教育是急不得的。好的关系才是好的教育。”这是詹大年在教育圈里最广为人知的一句“箴言”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一位曾就读于“丑小鸭”的学生这么形容他心目中的“詹式治校”：“我看你也没有什么别的招数呀，就是对那些容易惹祸的学生，先不惹他们；然后呢，让他们吃好喝好玩好，就行了。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;詹大年朗声大笑，“你看得很准啊。就是这样。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;以前，每每听到詹大年强调“理解”、“信任”、“关系就是一切”，讲求“科学管理”的教育专家李镇西总觉得“太玄乎”，现在他越来越明白了詹大年。 “教育不能仅仅规范行为，更应该关注心灵。&#39;丑小鸭&#39;是把孩子当人，着眼于每一个人的人格尊严、精神自由。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在成人眼中“有问题”的孩子，也会成为彼此心灵的照护者。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在“丑小鸭”，除了行政班和宿舍的生活班，每位新生还会被分配一名学长“师傅”，帮他们熟悉校园生活，克服生活中的负面情绪。有的孩子刚来时不吃饭、不洗漱、不洗衣服，说什么都不听。 “师傅”会带他们到心理室，但老李小杨并不一定立马介入，而是由学长陪其玩游戏，“有的学生是游戏高手，有的老师打游戏也很厉害，我们就给他介绍，他们可以聊很久。喜欢追番的，喜欢二次元和漫画的，喜欢唱歌、玩乐器的，都会慢慢凑到一起……”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/Sqc4Q0JTj4fIrtsrkp9D6kpi2OdyCkXc8K3mkGpV.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;538&quot; height=&quot;348&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/Sqc4Q0JTj4fIrtsrkp9D6kpi2OdyCkXc8K3mkGpV.jpg&quot;

&lt;p>;“丑小鸭”一度最红火的学生社团是心理社。 2014年8月3日，云南昭通发生地震。震后第二天，詹大年带领几个孩子驱车三百余公里，把救灾物资送到受灾村民手中。但他发现，灾区儿童的心理亟需干预和辅导，这恰恰是“丑小鸭”学生们可以着力的地方。很快，对心理辅导完全陌生的学生们查阅地震资料，请教心理老师：怎样帮助灾区哭泣和绝望的孩子？第二次进灾区，一群不到15岁的半大孩子，被一群更小的孩子唤作“老师”，一起做游戏，聊家常，带给了他们难得的欢笑。 “对我们的孩子，这也是一次极好的自我教育。”詹大年甚是欣慰。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;采访中，几位师生都向我提起一个叫罗亭的“学霸”男孩。 “有国外生活经历，家境好，人也帅，可一点都不显摆。”来丑小鸭之前，罗亭先后就读于上海一所国际学校和公立学校，因为对学校教学的不适应和疫情长期居家，最后干脆不去学校。每天大门不出，一言不发，把从小看着他长大的爷爷给愁坏了。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;到了千里之外的“丑小鸭”，他觉出这学校“挺不一样”，却也没有“一见倾心”。头一两个月，罗亭到哪儿都埋头做题，不与任何人说话。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;不知从哪天开始，他弹起走廊里那架珠江钢琴，像变了个人。 “小学二年级的时候学过半年，已经荒了四五年，相当于从头开始自学。”他不求速成，一首《卡农》和《花之舞》，照着搜到的曲谱来回弹上一学期，同学不时凑过来听，他也安然继续。 “那种愉悦，很难用言语表达。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;后来，罗亭和趣味相投的之寒、嘉渝成了死党。他们会凑在一起谈论中美贸易、俄乌冲突。初三下学期，几个人成立了学习小组，纷纷利用宝贵的“军训课免修”时间自习备考。 “在&#39;丑小鸭&#39;，我还喜欢上了跑步。”罗亭微笑着说。 “之寒原本体重超过100公斤，跑步以后，他瘦了40公斤，成了学校的传奇！”之寒的“励志跑”把罗亭也带成了跑步达人。学校的跑道接近125米一圈，他们每天跑上40圈，几乎“雷打不动”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;季果儿是个大大咧咧、“外粗内细”的女生。聊天时，她时不时地将视线转开，最后终于指着篮球架边一个人影，“小邓老师，我有个闺蜜在那边，她也好想和你聊聊。”于是，我和季果儿、她的闺蜜何蔓，手挽着手绕着操场走了一圈又一圈。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;季果儿说，何蔓有阵儿爱哭，她也不问那么多，就逗她笑。 “我跟她说，你哭起来可丑。她说你真讨厌。哈哈，这招儿管用。”季果儿笑得没心没肺。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“那对有些不爱说话的同学呢？”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“我们都在一个生活班，住在一个屋檐下，再不爱说话的人，久了都会说些各自的小秘密。你要是天天跟她念叨，她自然会来找你。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;她掰着指头和我说起同学的好：晓星老大方，不记仇；景雯喜欢看书、弹钢琴；何蔓开朗，性格好……&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“你刚说她爱哭？”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“嘿，她一看到我哭，又把自己眼泪憋回去，把我安慰好。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我们乐成一团。她却严肃起来：“其实像我们这么大的人都好面子，不希望显得弱，希望自己强。那得让他们（&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;同学&lt;/span>;）慢慢接受这个世界。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;看起来做事积极、待人周到、能指出他人问题的季果儿，在老师们眼中也会出言不逊，容易失去表达的边界。向国跃说，青春期的孩子常会表现出刺猬的特征。 “丑小鸭”的学生在原来学校和家庭里个人意志可能被强压着，到了这里就会反应出来。从2011年便加入学校的李桂红，原来也觉得孩子们“不守规矩”，总会用一些类似恶作剧的方式宣告他们的存在。 “詹校说，对孩子们要用放大镜看优点、老花镜看缺点。于是我也学会了欣赏他们。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“在&#39;丑小鸭&#39;，爱说话就让你接待新同学，会钢琴就尽可能地给机会弹；文章写得好会被张贴。我们有位C诗人，写了一篇关于爱情，一篇谈人生的，大家都可崇拜他了……不管是文艺演出还是演讲比赛，学校要求每个人都得上场，打酱油也要上台，演成什么样都给你鼓掌呵呵。”季果儿的话像袋子打开口的豆子，倾泻而出。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“对，还有小英。”从警校毕业的生活老师龙金英刚满二十，一头长发挡不住浑身的英气。采访那几天，她不是在拾掇买来的盆栽，就是拿着锯子锯木条、垒花架。 “小英太厉害了。生病帮你配药，装修、刷墙，火把节跳傣族舞，全能！她对情绪爆发的孩子很有一套，会让你出去走走。等冷静下来，再和你聊。”季果儿与何蔓心目中的小英，俨然已是女生们共同的“偶像”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/FXAdGQ7EL1u9qNNPEzEj4kyufjey5KUhzOnecwsB.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;546&quot; height=&quot;364&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/FXAdGQ7EL1u9qNNPEzEj4kyufjey5KUhzOnecwsB.jpg&quot;

&lt;p>;但能干如小英、向国跃，也有不太使得上劲的时候。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“像朴朴和田榄，他们的父母虽然也和他们发生过争执，但总体还是能平复下来，接受孩子当下的状态，与学校配合。”向国跃指出，最难办的是，有的家长把孩子送过来，是希望“你按照他们的方式来教育孩子，只关心成绩，不关心背后是什么”；或者意识不到自己的问题，很难沟通；更有甚者，对孩子几乎不闻不问。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“孩子心里缺爱，父母却很少回应，甚至带给他们一次次的伤害。于是亲子之间彼此伤害。有的孩子还会被迫卷入成年人的关系之中，学会了暴力、疏离和冷漠。”李桂红说。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;有感于亲情教育的重要，詹大年从办学不久便开设了家长课堂。他的私人公号长年以一天两条消息的频率持续传播教育理念。许多家长在孩子抑郁、厌学、和父母停止交流后，从詹大年的公号上获得精神力量。有的，则直接将孩子送来这里。但转变却非朝夕之功。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;大脸庞、眸子明亮的何蔓，生长在中越边境的H城。她对童年印象最深的画面便是，爸爸骑着摩托车带她上学，妈妈晚上忙于美容院的生意，白天在睡觉。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;四年级转学到Q城，爸爸没时间照看她，便找了她原来的数学老师，花钱请她跨城过来做“保姆+辅导老师”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;从六年级到初二，何蔓辗转换了五六次学校。 “当时我当啦啦操副队长，跑步也跑第一。高年级的男生加我微信和QQ，同年级女生看我不爽，骂我绿茶。初二的学生威胁我交保护费，我只好拼命往后门跑，痞子挺多。老师说我学习不好，不让其他人跟我玩。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;她在墙角抽烟，被人举报。 “其实大家都抽，但他们只说我。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;她和爸爸哭诉，没用。 “没好好听我说。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“妈妈呢？”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“妈妈连我初一下学期学校在哪里、住哪里都不知道。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;她吞过二十来颗布洛芬，都是感冒时去学校医务室一点点存下的。 “跳楼也不行，都围着栏杆，没条件。就吃药了。活着真的没意义。妈妈跟老师说我鬼迷眼，故意吓他们。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;她再次从学校逃开。到底被爸妈逮住，在H城老家的地下车库关了一个晚上。 “用铁丝打我，扇我，掐我脖子，拉着我洗文身。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;她又回到Q城。去手机店上班，又被爸妈带回。 “他们只想抓我回去。我太多太多的人生，他们都没有参与。我只想逃脱。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;说到这儿，有个请了几天假的女生回到学校，何蔓看着大门口，露出一丝开心：“我们好多同学休假回来，常常带一大袋话梅薯片果冻、披萨给我们吃。有的会给生活班每个人都带杯奶茶，可美咯。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在“丑小鸭”，娟娟让她当班长；杨校让她接待来访客人；小英会安慰她，好好听她说话。刚来这里不久就赶上了夏令营，“从早到晚我们都在操场聊天，天黑了一起看电影、吃烧烤……”她原以为，到“丑小鸭”以后第一次给父母打电话自己会哭，结果竟然全程欢笑。 “我本来对前男友很执着，老李说，我其实对恋爱一窍不通。哈哈。不过我真的知道了，外面虚虚渺渺，我现在学会看人了。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;因为课程落下太多，15岁的她在“丑小鸭”重修初二。她不着急，慢慢地体恤起总是对她“恨铁不成钢”的爸爸。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;爷爷奶奶老家不在云南，过来几十年，在镇上还是不受待见。五十开外的爸爸，早年在H城做会计，在何蔓眼里其实是家族中最懂事的一个。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“他是家里最正经做事的，可小时候吃到一块糖都奢侈。他恨家里人，觉得不公平，什么烂摊子都是他去擦屁股。所以他希望我有出息，能留在身边。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;来“丑小鸭”前，何蔓曾去昆明看过心理医生。 “医生说，你们两代人之间隔阂太深。反正我好多事情，爸妈不问，我也不说。有时候我调皮，就是想故意气他们一下。”她顿了顿，语气柔和下来：“我爸有糖尿病，我现在不会再故意气他了。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;小野的故事里，则几乎只有她和母亲。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“今天是我来到丑小鸭的第136天。”刚坐下，她清晰地说出这个日子。每过一天，她都会在日历上划掉一杠——“感觉又离回家近了一天。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;和另外几个女生迫不及待的分享欲不同，小野的眼神和嘴角都带着一分打量。她擅长美术，最近学校的“班级文化”，从楼梯间到宿舍墙壁再到走廊的装饰画，她全有贡献；唱歌、跳舞，样样拿得出手。但好像这些还不够满足她的渴望。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“她经常自伤，拿尺子、石头，中性笔掰断，什么都用。手和腿抓得跟鱼鳞似的。”李桂红说，朴朴的自残更多是一种情绪宣泄，小野的行为里还多了一份“求得关注”的意图。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在小野的描述里，妈妈会觉得离婚是因为女儿的缘故，“所以老带着私人情绪怨怼我。”从很小起，妈妈越是不许她干什么，她就越来越想做。一吵架，两人总是拿出恶毒的语言互相指责，“她说我有妄想症。我说你也去看看，肯定你有问题。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;小野曾经很爱给妈妈写信，写微信，或者手写几百字的信，再拍照发给“老李”。 “其实是希望我转发给她妈妈。有的外省的父母可能来三四次了，她觉得妈妈怎么老不来。不来就是不爱我。要立刻实现才是爱我。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“等我们长大了，要把那些叛逆的家长送到一间叫&#39;丑老鸭&#39;的学校去，或者叫&#39;丑小鸡&#39;，哈哈！”说起和同学瞎聊时的提议，小野耸肩大笑。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;可妈妈知道她想买“洛丽塔”服饰，爱看漫展，都会全力支持。 “我不是个合格的女儿……对不起我妈。”小野眼眶有点泛红。她希望自己早点独立，能挣钱，“出去了给我妈打钱。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“亲爸？没见过，因为我是女孩就不要我了。他现在想见我？没可能。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;关于“丑小鸭”，她来之前查过这地方，学校名字怪怪的。 “过一种幸福完整的教育生活……”她喃喃念起引自教育家朱永新的这句“丑小鸭”校训，“能实现吗？”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;她拒绝上到初三毕业，希望早点离开，因为外头有好多好玩的等着她。在老家，她小学四五年级就跑去KTV，“那些加微信的姐姐都好漂亮。”她们称赞她“会唱歌跳舞，化妆也好，不会惹事”，还有大人教她“不要太在乎别人看法”这样的人生道理，她都觉得可长见识、可快活了。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;她希望老李和妈妈沟通，让她回去。但妈妈不放心，“在宜良能够切断她和老家的社会关系。”李桂红说，她曾婉转地提醒小野，社会上的人讲义气，但小恩小惠后面很可能有对未成年人的利用。 “这些道理她暂时还不太能听进去，但我们总得要一点一点和她讲。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/BYA0RMGelbZiZ46SxJFr4d0fM8KD2hJpXWFgFPnw.jpg&quot;

&lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;2023年10月21日，首届青少年心理安全论坛讲座现场&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（南方人物周刊记者翁洹/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;新的教育哲学&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;怀揣着更多个朴朴和小野的故事，我暂别待了三天的“丑小鸭”，前往昆明。关于青少年抑郁，各种专题讨论早已屡见不鲜，但10月21-22日在昆明举办的首届青少年心理安全论坛的热度还是超出了主办方的预料。踊跃发言者，从写纸条、抢话筒，到有人直接冲到大舞台边，要“带着冒犯”地直抒胸臆。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一位詹大年的读者表示，自己从小学习顺利，一直就读本地最好的学校，但从来不快乐也没有成就感，三十好几还在迷茫；几位老师和家长带着孩子遇到的校园霸凌、心理疾病问题现场求助；还有几位来自不同学校的老师提出，想要去关怀学生，却势单力薄，“我们也是问题老师，谁来帮助我们？！”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“既说明大家有巨大的表达欲和想要解决问题的热忱，也说明，无论是教育工作者还是孩子家长，很多人本身也都存在着心理问题需要被看到，被疏导。”一位与会嘉宾感叹。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2021年6月修订实施的《未成年人保护法》明确规定：教育行政部门应当加强未成年人的心理健康教育，建立未成年人心理问题的早期发现和及时干预机制。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但在论坛内外，大家讨论更多的，是那些引发抑郁或者因抑郁导致的现实生活中的问题。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;著名教育专家冯恩洪指出，构筑青少年心理安全教育防线所面对的，是当今社会在教育问题上的全体性迷失。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;陈瑜是家庭教育平台“少年大不同”创始人，曾深度访谈过上百个抑郁、厌学、挣扎绝望的中小学生。今年找她当面和电话咨询的学生里，数量激增的是高一新生。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“有的孩子上高一第一天，做作业到夜里11点。老师说，你都上高中了，还指望睡好觉吗？有北京&#39;六小强&#39;（&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;海淀名校&lt;/span>;）的学生问我，我为什么需要学到滴水不漏、一字不差的程度？这是很多孩子的困惑。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;有学生告诉陈瑜，开学第一天，学校里做如是动员：“拥有成绩，就拥有一切。坐在你身边的同学，都是中考考场的敌人。”她遇到一位深圳名校的女生，凌晨4点起来读书，渐渐地例假也不来了。她问女孩，“一切都要为分数让道吗？成绩比身体还重要吗？”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“女孩说，是的。&#39;这样也好，我再不用担心考试撞上生理期了。&#39;还有辽宁一位排名年级第一的孩子觉得自己&#39;像窃取了皇帝桂冠的窃贼&#39;，好像坐在高台上，一阵风吹来，就会倒掉。”陈瑜总结，这一代的孩子，厌学更早，休学更长，复学更难。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“如果孩子视力下降、睡眠不足、体质羸弱、心理畸形，乃至生命夭折，所有教育的辉煌成就都毫无意义！”李镇西在他的演讲中疾呼。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当学生有抑郁倾向或被确诊，会遭遇截然不同的境遇。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;陈瑜访谈过的一个孩子，确诊抑郁症之后被同学排挤，课桌里塞满了垃圾和矿泉水瓶。后来新的班主任约她出来在咖啡馆聊，复学的时候，她牵着小姑娘的手走进学校，到班级门口的时候，全班同学鼓掌欢迎她，孩子心理发生了剧变。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但在江浙某地，有学校给临近高三的学生做了心理测评和评估，“校方对其中一些孩子说，你目前的情绪状态没有办法适应学校接下来的学业。就把他们退学了。很多抑郁症的孩子也会说，我回到家里以后就没有任何的老师和学生来联系我。他觉得我从此被这个组织抛弃了。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;解决之道在哪里？ &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;教育家杨东平的回答是，教育部门不断推出“减负”新政，然而如何摆脱教育方针与教育现实长期两张皮、素质教育缺乏生命力的状态？答案只有一个：中国需要新的教育哲学，要从头做起自上而下的顶层设计。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;他进一步提出：要从源头上减少课程教学时数，降低教学浓度、考试难度，推行小学的全科教师模式，改善教育生态；取消重点学校，试点学科分层，有利于学生之间的交流，减少因教育分流制度而造成的贴标签或受歧视的现象。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“当你把孩子当作一个人来尊重，跟他相处，你就会得到一个正常健康的人；如果你把孩子当作学习机器，那你得到的就是一个物件。”杨东平的掷地有声和詹大年的朴素语言都引起了听众的强烈共鸣。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;来丑小鸭中学参观和阅读詹大年公号的读者感受到，“问题孩子”在这里找回了自己，也认识了生活，他们可以重新起航。 “那么，一所普通学校能办成&#39;丑小鸭&#39;吗？假如对正常的孩子也是以这种方式教育会怎样？”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;然而詹大年一直强调，丑小鸭中学是一种预防型的学校，是为不适应传统教育体制的孩子提供适合的教育方式，而非提供一种解困的方法论。 “我们今天碰到的所有教育症结，都不是一个论坛能改变的。但它能提供一种思考：我们的教学，我们的家庭教育，是不是出了什么问题？这就是这些探讨和发声能起到的作用。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在人前似乎“难不倒”的詹大年，坦承他面对抑郁和其他表现的孩子常有束手无策的时刻。曾经有一个父母分开的混血女生，一根脚趾被自己用皮筋缠到坏死，来了“丑小鸭”又想缠另一根。来了好几个月依然头也不抬，进展缓慢。 “这孩子后来我们只好劝退了，因为已经超出了我们的能力范围，需要医疗机构的干预。”詹大年的语调里有一种少见的失落与无力。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我问陈瑜，假如学校环境很难改变，有的父母又像嘉宾们说的“冥顽不灵”，她会给访谈的那些孩子怎样的建议？ &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“我期待国内的职高和技术学校现状有所转变，让有一技之长的普通人都能过上体面的生活。一个孩子但凡有那么一点闪光的部分，他就不会全然否定自己。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一个泉州的妈妈曾向她求助：儿子智商略有缺陷，她很希望孩子能跟上同学学习的节奏，但孩子已经开始厌学。陈瑜了解到男孩非常喜欢饲养宠物，“我说你跟着我想象一下，在你们生活的这条街上有爸爸开的海鲜店，有你开的影楼，有你孩子开的花鸟鱼虫店，不是很美好吗？她说陈老师，以前别人都劝我也要&#39;卷&#39;，听你这么一说，我就很开心了。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“在当下，看懂孩子和时代尤为重要。每个孩子都自带粮草和地图。我们要为孩子全面托底，不要让他们举目四望，寂寥无人。”陈瑜打着比方。 “一位理解你的补课老师，一个值得信任的男朋友/女朋友，都可以是支点。”如果身边就是没有托底的人，我会告诉他们，挺一挺，18岁以后你就有机会疗愈自己，要成为自己滋养自己的人。 ”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;结束在“丑小鸭”的采访前，朴朴告诉我，她希望回到那所“高质量严管控”的中学参加中考，因为姑父开出租车，刚念初一的堂弟要一边做作业、一边带两岁的小弟弟，还要给姑父做饭，如果她长大有份好工作，“可以让堂弟不那么辛苦”；何蔓说，以前老和爸爸吵架，现在隔几天会念叨，爸爸怎么不发消息；一直在自学日语、过了N2的小野长大想当插画师，“妈妈支持我去日本留学”；季果儿的妈妈则希望她能上警校，“可我想当幼师，教小朋友。詹校也觉得我可以哈。 ”&lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;我和赵夏瀛医生的缘分始于新冠病毒入侵的初期，我与好友金圣华商量想在新冠战役中为社会尽点心意，圣华介绍了雷兆辉医生和赵夏瀛医生夫妇给我认识，因此我们成了朋友。去年圣诞节期间，我们在半岛酒店喝下午茶，听到赵医生跟圣华讨论脑退化症的项目，我认为这是刻不容缓的，因此主动要求参与其事，希望能略尽绵力帮助推动这项义举，使隐形和轻度脑退化症的人，得以预防和延缓病症，减轻自己和家人的痛苦，减轻社会的负担。赵医生介绍了善衡书院莫仲棠院长和高锟慈善基金主席黄美芸女士（高锟夫人）跟我认识，我们四方面一拍即合，很快就推动起脑退化这个项目，善缘因而由此延续下去。&lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;说件有趣的事，我因为想亲近九十岁的昔日巨星葛兰姐，跟她一起去票京戏，对票戏也有些好奇心，票友七个人，有三个是九十岁以上，其中一位高寿九十九，不用拐杖、不坐轮椅、不带看护，西装笔挺地一个人走进来，三个九十以上唱起京戏中气十足令人惊叹，聊起天来也毫无顾忌地畅所欲言，真不能称呼他们老先生老太太，他们活得潇洒自在。其间大家开玩笑，把葛兰姐和九十九凑成一对，我觉得好可爱，举起相机起哄“亲一个！亲一个！”九十九大大方方地在葛兰姐脸上亲了一下，大家拍手鼓掌好不快乐。&lt;/p>;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;几个月前，他鱼塘里的水产品在一夜之间忽然死了不少，损失惨重。他的鱼塘靠近海边，每逢农历初一和十五涨大潮，引海水入塘换水。遭受损失的还有另外三位养殖户邻居，他们都是在2023年7月2日——农历五月十五这天换水的。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;向大海索取馈赠的不仅有刘明等鱼塘养殖户，还有一两公里外滩涂地带的缢蛏（俗称“蛏子”）养殖户。刘明等人怀疑，养蛏人在滩涂上投放农药，涨潮后形成“毒水”，正好赶上换水被引入鱼塘，毒死了水产品。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;刘明表示，他们已经报案，目前还未有调查结果。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;不同生物体质不同，只要掌握合适剂量，农药可以杀死、驱赶蛏子在滩涂上的天敌，而不影响蛏子。长期研究蛏子养殖的厦门海洋职业技术学院海洋生物学院高级实验师黄标武告诉南方周末记者，在滩涂使用农药的养蛏方式，目前存在于我国部分沿海地区。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;这些农药最常见的是三唑磷，主要用于防治果树、棉花、粮食类作物害虫，但用于蛏子养殖则属违规。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;使用农药提高了蛏子单一物种的存活率，却牺牲了生物多样性。滩涂是全球百万候鸟的中转站，丰富的贝类等是它们的食物。目前，农药在蛏子体内的残留情况、代谢规律及对人体健康的影响，尚未有充分研究。由于监管难度较高等原因，这种养殖方法在部分沿海地区未得到有效管理。&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;杀死天敌又不毒死蛏子&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;蛏子是广受欢迎的平价海鲜，黄标武告诉南方周末记者，目前市面上售卖的蛏子基本为养殖产品，主要有池塘养殖和滩涂养殖两种方法。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;早期养殖蛏苗来源于野生苗，而野生蛏苗只产于浙江和福建，数量有限。十几年前，蛏子人工育苗技术取得突破后，大面积的滩涂养殖方法才兴起。&lt;/p>;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;随着滩涂养蛏的推广，三唑磷等清滩药物也开始流行。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;潮水涨落形成了一片宽达数千米的潮间带，是生物多样性宝库，除了蛏子，这里栖息着藻类、螺类、虾蟹类、小型鱼类等丰富生物，也吸引鸟类觅食。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;黄标武解释，蛏苗刚投放时，还无法钻入泥土很深，容易成为滩涂上其他生物的食物，严重时蛏农甚至颗粒无收。而三唑磷可以杀死蟹类、螺类、虾虎鱼等蛏子的天敌。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;如何使用三唑磷等药物有不少讲究。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;曾在滩涂上养过蛏子的李成向南方周末记者介绍，首先要解决交通问题。在广袤的滩涂，蛏子养殖场成千上万亩，一眼望不到边。单凭双脚无法活动，马上会陷入泥沼。为此养蛏人乘坐一种类似滑板车的自制工具，称为“泥橇”。它是一块两头微翘的长条木板，中间立着扶手，驾驶者一腿跪在板上，另一腿蹬地，可以在泥滩上迅速滑行。四百年前，它曾是戚家军战胜倭寇的“秘密武器”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;三唑磷撒在滩涂上的剂量、区域需要严格控制——达到既杀死天敌又不能毒死蛏子的目的。养蛏场地类似田埂，每条约150米宽，两条梗之间相距约50米，便于行船。养蛏人把约50斤的农药桶倾斜放在泥橇后方，匀速直线前进，农药从桶身上的小眼缓缓流出，1小时前进约2公里。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;李成透露，这些三唑磷并非购自市场，“有专门批发的，直接联系人家就能给你送过来”。撒药时间一般选在大潮来临之前，涨潮后，滩涂上的药物随着海水蔓延开来。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;正是这种养殖“潜规则”让刘明他们怀疑，自家鱼塘在大潮换水后突遭损失与养蛏撒药有关。类似事件在当地并非首次发生。养殖户甚至总结出了经验，换水前先问海边赶海的人，是否发现死鱼，以判断海水是否“含毒”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;当地蛏苗在3月开始播撒，来年3月收获。因为天气变冷后，近岸蛏子的天敌比较少，撒药时间从3月持续到9月，每个月通常最多撒两次。“三唑磷的味道可呛人了，刺激性特别强。”李成说，有次他把三唑磷放在车里，那种令人难受的味道好几天都没有消散。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;据媒体报道，2018年，在江苏盐城大丰养了18年蛏子的老王突然出现胸闷、头晕、乏力，医生找到元凶是老王使用的有机磷农药，能杀死破坏蛏子生长环境的蜾蠃蜚（一种小型生物，俗称“海革子”）。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;除了三唑磷，李成还使用过敌敌畏和吡虫啉两种农药，它们也是为了毒杀蛏子的天敌，但三唑磷的用量最大。&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;明令禁止但监管难&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;三唑磷、敌敌畏和吡虫啉等农药在水产养殖中使用并不合规。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;一位水产、渔药领域专家在接受南方周末记者采访时表示，我国水产养殖用药实行白名单制度。“白名单内的水产养殖用兽药，均经过了严格的药效学、毒理学、食品安全和环境影响等方面的研究，对使用效果和在水产品体内的代谢残留规律等有较为深入的认知。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;白名单外化学药物，不得非法使用。养蛏人使用的三唑磷等农药，并不在白名单内。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;关于三唑磷已有一些研究。浙江省海洋水产研究所等机构的专家于2007年发表的一篇文章提到，在养蛏过程中使用的三唑磷，能在可食组织中残留，实验模拟数据表明，三唑磷在蛏子中的积累和消除速度均较快，在用药24小时后，缢蛏体内三唑磷浓度达2.97mg/kg，100小时后，降至0.021mg/kg。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;目前我国仅制定了三唑磷在植物性食品中限量标准，水产品中没有标准可循。参考《食品安全国家标准食品中农药最大残留限量》(GB 2763-2021)，最高限量是水果，为0.2mg/kg，最小限量为小麦、燕麦等谷物，为0.05mg/kg。上述研究的24小时数据严重超标，100小时数据未超标。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;不过，因三唑磷易造成蔬菜农残超标，三唑磷在蔬菜种植中也不受欢迎，2013年，原农村部规定，在2016年12月31日以后禁止其在蔬菜上使用。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;一些地方已明确禁用三唑磷养蛏。例如，2017年，野生蛏苗主产地之一浙江省乐清市发布《关于禁止在浅海滩涂养殖中使用农药的通告》，严禁在浅海滩涂养殖中使用三唑磷、敌敌畏、五氯酚钠、氯氰菊酯、吡虫啉等农药，鼓励居民制止并举报违规现象。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;也有处罚案例。2017年，浙江宁波宁海县渔政渔港监督管理站执法人员发现有人在养殖蛏子过程中使用三唑磷，罚款一万元。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;但三唑磷等农药使用的监管难度很高。一些沿海养殖户告诉南方周末记者，这种养殖方式隐秘多年，为避人耳目，养蛏人一般会在深夜撒农药。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;早在2014年，环保组织“青岛市海洋生态研究会”理事长王松林就曾目睹滩涂上一群养蛏人正在播撒三唑磷。研究会在2019年发布的《蛏：中国近海养殖评估报告》指出，进入养殖滩涂湿地交通不便，给监管工作带来诸多困难。例如，人、车辆、船舶都无法在泥泞的滩涂上前行，监管人员难以锁定证据。&lt;/p>;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;王松林表示，不仅蛏子，有的经济型贝类如杂色蛤的滩涂增养殖、黄渤海沿岸规模较大的海参围堰养殖产业，也有违规使用化学药品现象。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;青岛市海洋生态研究会于2019年发布的《海参：中国近海池塘及围堰养殖评估报告》提到，海参的围堰养殖滥用化学品问题较为严重。例如，为预防和治疗病害，育苗阶段违规使用抗生素；为清塘和杀死海参的天敌，养殖过程违法使用杀虫剂和除草剂；海参的加工、销售环节还可能过量添加明矾、违法使用甲醛，导致海参中铝含量和甲醛超标。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;在滩涂养蛏，不仅使用农药会破坏生物多样性，搭设防鸟网也会导致鸟类死亡。普林斯顿大学副研究员梁丹等新发表的一项研究发现，2021年4月和5月候鸟的春季迁徙高峰期，在福建兴化湾和浙江乐清湾两地，为养殖蛏子而架设的防鸟网困住了1.3万余只鸻鹬类候鸟，其中不乏国家重点保护的物种。课题组在浙江和福建的其他17个地点也发现了类似的防鸟网。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;梁丹告诉南方周末记者，上述两地滩涂专门养殖蛏苗，蛏苗一般从11月左右下苗，长到第二年3、4月份便可以收获。如果在3、4月蛏苗收获后立即拆除这些防鸟网，就可以拯救春季迁徙的上万只鸟类，也可避免部分防鸟网进入大海伤害海洋生物。但由于在滩涂拆网需较高的人工费，养殖户在售卖完蛏苗后仍将网继续留在滩涂上，等到6、7月让台风将网卷走。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;自然状态下，蛏子只是滨田湿地生物多样性的组成部分。在受到法律保护的天然滩涂湿地上开展增养殖，王松林认为，渔民得接受蛏子的高自然死亡率——被天敌捕食、与其他底栖动物竞争。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;但这很难。无论是蛏子还是海参，养殖过程使用有机磷、菊酯类农药等违禁化学品，都体现出养殖户的惯性思维：将自然滩涂和海岸带当作农田管理，把养殖产品当作单一类型的“农作物”。“我询问的一对打药回来的老夫妻，他们非常热情，直言海滩跟棉花田没有区别，要确保蛏子高产，就得用药打死其他鱼虾蟹贝，还得赶走长嘴的水鸟。”王松林说。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;古语有云：“四月蛏肥美，莫负西施舌。”四月份是蛏子最肥美的时节，但却不是生态友好的食用时间。因为春、秋季节也是候鸟过境高峰期，减少天然滩涂湿地上的打药清滩、放炮驱鸟等人为活动干扰，对生态保护意义重大。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;如何解决这些矛盾，浙江省乐清市提倡使用船耕机、生石灰、漂白粉、晾晒等方法清滩清塘。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;黄标武则建议养殖户回到池塘养殖的老方法。池塘养殖可以用生态友好的生石灰、中药材代替三唑磷清塘。池塘养蛏需要肥水，原理相当于庄稼施肥，池塘养蛏还可以利用其他鱼塘排放的尾水作为肥水，净化这些尾水中富含的氮、磷等有机质，变废为宝。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>;（刘明、李成为化名）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 02 Nov 2023 16:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[俄罗斯铝业公司创始人奥列格·德里帕斯卡：没有特斯拉汽车，大家还是会活下去的]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259777]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-02 14:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;文华东方酒店位于北京王府井大街，可以远眺故宫。 2023年10月25日晚，在其五楼的豪华会议厅包厢里，俄罗斯铝业公司创始人奥列格·德里帕斯卡正在等待来访的媒体。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;奥列格·德里帕斯卡曾经是全球最大铝业公司的创始人。他在采访中自称是一名“苏联时期的物理学家”，早年毕业于莫斯科国立大学物理学系，苏联解体之后学术经费锐减，没有津贴和助学金，导致他无法继续物理研究。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;离开学校之后，他和同事们成立了一家贸易公司，从俄罗斯出口金属，之后他用赚来的第一桶金收购了俄罗斯第三大电解铝厂，这也成为他事业的起点。之后，通过资产合并的方式，他建立了全世界最大的铝业公司——俄罗斯铝业公司，这家企业2015年在香港上市，成为首个在中国上市的俄罗斯企业。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2018年4月，美国对德里帕斯卡和其他23名俄罗斯富豪和官员实施制裁，他被列入了美国的特别指定国民名单（SDN）。进入这个名单之后，美国财政部下属的外国资产控制办公室会对其在美国司法管辖范围内的财产和财产权益进行冻结。美国公民和在美国境内的实体通常被禁止与SDN名单上的个人或实体进行任何形式的交易或业务。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这份名单不仅影响到被列入的个人或实体，还影响到与他们有业务往来的第三方，与名单上的实体进行交易可能会导致违反美国的制裁法规，从而面临法律后果。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;奥列格·德里帕斯卡在俄乌冲突开始之后又遭到澳大利亚、加拿大、欧盟诸国、英国等多个国家制裁。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/fQStqglwidgSDAi5dVMiyvWSx6s8WSQcKTMpNnVC.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;

&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;奥列格·德里帕斯卡：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;我是莫斯科国立罗蒙诺索夫大学董事会成员，我们在深圳参观了北理莫斯科大学，这是一所莫斯科国立罗蒙诺索夫大学和北京理工大学创办的联合大学。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我们已经开办了一个国际商务学院，以及数学物理学院。之前，莫斯科大学办过一个国际班，大概二三十个不同国家的学生来到了莫大学习数学物理专业，其中30%是中国学生。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;俄罗斯的数学教育在全世界都是最好的，我们希望能够促进这样的学术交流。同时中国学生可以学俄语，俄罗斯学生可以学会中文。我们要投资于交通设施、金融设施，但是我们也要投资于科学教育，一些科学项目现在看起来不是很重要，但是二十年或者五十年之后，会成为人类社会发展的关键。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;如何看待目前卢布的波动？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;奥列格·德里帕斯卡：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;卢布波动这个问题当然存在，因为我们现在有一个军事冲突，但是俄罗斯的结算平衡还是很强。只要未来两三年不出现某些很大的冲突，卢布波动就没有很大的问题，因为俄罗斯的资源产业还是挺好的。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;您在年初认为俄罗斯需要欢迎更多来自友好国家的投资，那么，促进中俄企业合作还有哪些事情可以做？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;奥列格·德里帕斯卡：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;第一，需要时间，两国之间的经济合作基础就是信任，我们已经有了信任基础。之前俄罗斯工业70%是靠欧洲的技术，现在还需要时间进行转型，改变我们的国家标准，和我们的友好国家进行合作。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;有了问题就一定要及时解决，不要后来积重难返。包括我在内的企业家，之前都提出过这个问题，为什么俄罗斯对外贸易这么不平衡？ 80%来自欧洲，20%来自亚洲，我们需要找到一个平衡点。未来两三年内，我们会努力解决好之前一直没有解决的问题。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;第二，我们一定要投资于基础设施，不仅仅是物流设施，也包括金融平台。金融平台不仅仅是结算问题，两国已经学会了怎样进行本币结算，但是债务市场还没有得到我们想要的那些成果。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;10年之前，俄罗斯汽车工业就开始说要做进口替代，但是他们并没有开始做，直到问题已经出现了才开始解决。 5年、10年之前，我们都难以想象美国会这样做。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;美国对你的制裁是不是严重影响了你的生活？会影响你的心理吗？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;奥列格·德里帕斯卡：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;从心理方面来看，我觉得没有很大的影响。苏联时期，我曾在军队服过役，遇到过更加严峻的形势。从那时起，我对危险就有了另外一种态度和认识。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;你为什么会被美国财政部制裁？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;奥列格·德里帕斯卡：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;2017年，我有一家公司在伦敦上市，成功吸引了20亿美元的投资，结果过了5个月，我和我的公司就被列入制裁清单。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;他们提到各种借口，但事实上并没有合法理由把我列入制裁名单上。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一个借口是在大连召开的达沃斯论坛上，我发表了一个演讲，提到建立东方统一能源市场，可我演讲真正的主题是要推动核能的发展。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;那时候铝价格上涨70%，投机者赚了很多钱。这表明，如果你不考虑到危险，寄望于良好的合作关系，早晚危险会变为现实。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/wySfdXOpFXcb8LK6lKyGfYeQo7MMy0kXzuUYlkpF.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;

&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;奥列格·德里帕斯卡：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;对我个人来说，没有任何的影响。从年轻的时候，我就没有很多物质上的需求。对其他人来说，特别如果是孩子在国外留学的话，影响还是挺大的。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;您算是很早就遭到了制裁，会有朋友来向你请教经验吗？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;奥列格·德里帕斯卡：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;是的，我对于应对西方国家的制裁有很丰富的经验。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我的结论是，要投资一些不依赖西方金融系统的国家。假如哪个国家和美国之间发生极端冲突，没有人会遵守法律，这些不动产、项目都会被拿走。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;当财产被拿走时，您感到难过吗？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;奥列格·德里帕斯卡：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;说实话，没有任何特别的感受，我不是一个很眷念物质的人。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;如何才能不担心遭到制裁?&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;奥列格·德里帕斯卡：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;如果没有独立自主，这永远是一个问题。如果仅仅是缺乏某些物资，五年十年时间，还是可以活下去的。我觉得全世界已经意识到了这种危险。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;南方周末：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;您说的独立自主是一种孤立主义吗？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;奥列格·德里帕斯卡：&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;当然不是。我们面临着全球性的问题，比如说是气候变化、贫困、疾病等等。但是，制裁不会促进某个国家的发展，只有国与国之间的信任，只有国与国之间的经济合作、互利共赢的发展，才可以解决好这些全球性的问题。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;难道西方制裁会让被制裁的国家改变自己的政策吗？不会的。没有特斯拉汽车，大家还是会活下去的。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;相反这些制裁会让我们重新去思考促进自己的发展，填补一些漏洞和缺点。比如促进交通物流的发展，完善我们的金融市场，以本币进行结算。我们要构建一个新的国际安全体系，新的国际关系体系，避免新的危机。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;之前的世界就是以西方为中心，就是所有的技术、所有的投资都是由西方国家最初决定的，也导致了许多地区冲突。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 02 Nov 2023 14:25:02 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
