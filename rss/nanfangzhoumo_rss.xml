She believes that in a Western environment, one should not eat rice with hands, spoons or chopsticks, but should push the rice to the top of the back of the fork with a table knife and then put it elegantly into the mouth, which can appear more educated and graceful. This &quot;aristocratic&quot; video triggered all kinds of ridicule and ridicule. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many Chinese people also like to emphasize the concept of nobility, such as nobility in houses, cars, and clothing brands... Even a few days ago, I even saw the &quot;nobility&quot; in latex paint in building materials stores. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;They say they are aristocrats, but in fact they are mostly consumption paranoia. The social group of aristocrats has died, or is close to death, in both Eastern and Western societies. It is also an interesting historical review journey to have a general understanding of the birth, development, decline, and demise of aristocrats in Eastern and Western societies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In ancient Eastern and Western societies, aristocrats were born almost at the same time in the early stages of civilization. The development can be roughly divided into three major historical stages: classical aristocracy, ancient aristocracy, and modern aristocracy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Classical aristocracy began in the Western Zhou Dynasty and Spring and Autumn Period in the East, and emerged in the Republic of Ancient Rome in the West. Because they arose in the early days of agricultural society, the classical nobility in the East and West all originated from large landowners. In the Spring and Autumn Period in the East, princes were nobles, and the feudal system was an ancient system of large land ownership. Dining with bells and dishes, wine pools and meat forests are the lifestyles of nobles that distinguish them from common people. The titles of duke, marquis, uncle, son, and male divided the nobility hierarchy, including the &quot;scholar&quot; class attached to the nobility, and constituted the ruling order of ancient oriental agricultural society. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the West, in ancient Greek society, which was slightly earlier than ancient Rome, the aristocracy was not very powerful. Due to the lack of large contiguous areas of land in the Balkans, ancient Greece developed an early democratic system that reflected the demands of the wealthy business class in the city-states for an equal distribution of power. Rome owned a large amount of land in its conquered areas, such as North Africa and Spain, so it produced a large number of landed aristocrats. They were a strong foundation supporting the Roman Empire and shared power in the Senate. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the era of classicism, the aristocrats of the East and West not only monopolized a large amount of land and wealth, but also monopolized culture, knowledge, and art, producing and consuming amazing cultural and artistic achievements of that era: Ancient Greece and Roman sculpture and architectural art, as well as the elegance and praise in the Eastern &quot;Chu Ci&quot; and &quot;Poetry&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The 4th and 5th centuries AD were a watershed era in the changes of human civilization: the classical civilizations in the East and West (Eastern Han Dynasty and Western Rome) were defeated by the northern barbarians, and human civilization entered a period of darkness that lasted for hundreds of years. Era (or &quot;Middle Ages&quot;). The classical nobility died out in this era, and instead, the second round of &quot;ancient nobility&quot; (medieval nobility) emerged in both the East and the West. Moreover, in this era, both the East and the West produced military lord aristocrats. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the West, after the Germanic tribes conquered the Western Roman Empire, they divided territories and enfeoffed feudal lords, resulting in a large number of barbarian military nobles. These medieval nobles were rough, unpretentious, and simple... almost all of them They are illiterate. They only emphasize the spirit of martial arts. They compete with each other on whose arms are thicker, stronger, and have longer swords. If nothing happens, they compete on horseback. European military aristocrats regarded reading and writing as shameful and unmanly. The writing needs at the administrative level were almost entirely borne by priests and attendants. As a result, Christianity monopolized the ideology, culture and art of medieval Europe. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the East at the same time, the gentry (similar to aristocrats) in the Southern and Northern Dynasties and the Sui and Tang Dynasties were divided: the southern gentry, because of their &quot;dress and clothes&quot;, had higher cultural and artistic accomplishments, and were known as elegant and weak. The northern aristocracy has a considerable part of the Hu people&#39;s ancestry, and their cultural and artistic standards are low, but their military force value is high. This supported the &quot;Guanlong military aristocracy&quot; of the Sui and Tang dynasties. In the 6th and 7th centuries AD, the northern aristocratic army conquered the southern gentry, and China entered the second era of great unification. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Unification promoted economic and social development, and culture and art also flourished. Although the cultural level of the northern aristocrats was low, they were still improving. Their huge wealth was enough to support and consume great masters such as Li Bai, Du Fu, Wu Daozi, Yan Liben, and Li Guinian. The prosperity of the Tang Dynasty created the peak era of national culture and art. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The development of culture and art seems to inevitably lead to weak, hedonistic, decadent and even decadent lifestyles, both in the East and the West. In the East, the &quot;Huang Chao Uprising&quot; at the end of the Tang Dynasty completely ended the aristocratic era in China. To put it simply, all the nobles were killed, and &quot;the bones of the public officials were trampled on in the streets.&quot; Since the Tang Dynasty, there have been no aristocrats in China. It has entered the era of common people and landlords. The emperor and his relatives are also representatives of the common people and landlords. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;France is similar. From after the &quot;Hundred Years&#39; War&quot; to before the &quot;Great Revolution&quot;, the French aristocrats were prosperous, extravagant and luxurious. They lived a paradise-like life on earth for hundreds of years and created astonishing world-class culture and art. At the same time, it burned up the national wealth and led to the social and economic collapse of France. In the end, the entire modern French aristocratic group was almost ended on the guillotine. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Germany and England are the Anglo-Saxon branches of the Germanic ethnic group, and their medieval martial ethics lasted relatively long. The tradition of military aristocracy of these two ethnic groups even lasted until the middle of the 20th century. Until the two world wars, machine guns, cannons, tanks, bombers... ended a large number of British and German military aristocrats on the battlefield, and the modern aristocracy in Europe finally declined. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The movie &quot;Kingsman: The Secret Service&quot; vividly tells this historical process: As a large number of military nobles died on the battlefield, the vast aristocratic wealth became ownerless property, CEOs (not Boss) promoted the modern transformation of European society. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In modern society, the rise of the elite class is no longer the aristocracy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Nobility is identity politics and hereditary. The elite emphasizes non-identity politics, ability first, self-strength, and survival of the fittest. According to our ancient saying, &quot;Excellence in learning leads to officialdom.&quot; However, it is not enough to study well. You must also be good at doing things, obey laws and regulations, and be socially responsible. The elites of modern society: Most of them come from the civilian class, such as Elon Musk. Before he became successful, he also paved the floor in his garage. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Modern elite politics does not monopolize power like aristocratic politics, but breaks class solidification and opens up channels for individual advancement and dimensionality reduction, which is of great significance for preventing social rigidity and corruption. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Even Musk, the world’s richest man with hundreds of billions of dollars, has some unscrupulous sons. If we cannot effectively inherit, pioneer, and enterprising, we will fall back into mediocrity and will not be able to enjoy the hereditary privileges of the nobility. This is the modern elite system. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I hope that everyone can cheer up and make progress as much as possible, produce as many elites as possible to promote social progress, realize self-worth, and have fewer aristocratic dreams. That concept has been eliminated by history. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 09 Nov 2023 18:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[南方周末6件作品获广东新闻奖]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260282]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-09 17:29:57&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On November 8, organized by the Guangdong Journalists Association, The selection results of the 2022 Guangdong News Award and the 15th Guangdong Province News&lt;span style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;Golden Shuttle Award&lt;/span>; Golden Bell Award sponsored by the Guangdong Press Society have been announced. 381 works won the 2022 Guangdong News Awards, including 49 first prizes, 122 second prizes, and 210 third prizes. 10 comrades won the 15th Guangdong Province News&lt;span style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;Golden Shuttle Award&lt;/span>;, and 1 comrade won the 15th Guangdong Province News Golden Bell Award. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Six works of Southern Weekend Newspaper won the Guangdong News Award.

&lt;p>;On October 30, 2023, the movie &quot;The Thing My Dad Didn&#39;t Tell&quot; held its premiere in Beijing. The film is directed by Japanese director Yojiro Takita and stars Zhang Guoli and Han Geng. This is the first time that Yojiro Takita has directed a Chinese-language film, adapted from Xin You&#39;s novel &quot;Smell the Smoke&quot;. In the story, the Liu family has been making ice crystal cakes for generations, and it was passed down to the eighth generation Liu Jiansan. His father Liu Tingshen was still unwilling to reveal the secret recipe, and the two gradually became estranged. It wasn&#39;t until his father passed away that the secret recipe and the secrets accompanying it finally surfaced. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The film was finalized as early as 2018. After several twists and turns, the finalized poster was finally released recently, and it was officially announced that it will be released nationwide on November 3. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is not the first film by Yojiro Takita to encounter setbacks. The highlight of his career, &quot;The Embalmer,&quot; was released after a year&#39;s delay after filming was completed. &quot;The Embalmer&quot; is adapted from &quot;The Diary of a Coffin Bearer&quot; written by Shinmon Aoki. The author compiled his many years of experience into a book. In the world narrated by the coffin bearer, the deceased and the undertaker completed the passing of human life from generation to generation at a certain moment during the funeral ceremony. The movie starts from this and unfolds a sad and melancholy story around the protagonist who performs rituals for the deceased&#39;s body. &quot;The Embalmer&quot; won the 2009 Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film and swept the Japan Film Academy Awards - a total of 13 nominations and 8 wins. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Takita Yojiro recalled that the protagonist of the movie dealt with corpses every day, and the Japanese were not willing to accept it, let alone face death. The subject of the film thus became taboo. No company was willing to release it for fear of not selling well. In 2008, &quot;The Embalmer&quot; won awards at China&#39;s Golden Rooster and Hundred Flowers Film Festival and Canada&#39;s Montreal Film Festival. The news spread back to Japan, and the film was only released in theaters (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti; &quot;>;September 13, 2008&lt;/span>;) became popular and topped the box office. During the Oscar awards season, although the box office had declined and dropped out of the rankings, it returned to the top of the box office once the news of the award was announced. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Previously, Takita Yojiro&#39;s most famous work was &quot;Onmyoji&quot; directed in 2001, starring Nomura Mansai and Hideaki Ito; and &quot;Onmyoji&quot; directed in 1986, starring Yuya Uchida, Yumi Aso, and Takeshi Kitano. No Funny Magazine. The former is adapted from the &quot;Onmyoji&quot; series of novels by Dream Pillow Tapir, which tells the story of Abe Seimei, an onmyoji with superb magic skills in Japan&#39;s Heian period, who used his wisdom to exorcise ghosts and gods and solve difficult problems. The latter vividly reproduced many real events that occurred in Japan in 1985, revealing the dark side of society and condemning the media for its failure. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before the publication of the transformational work &quot;Don&#39;t Funny Magazine&quot;, Takita Yojiro was once known as a &quot;pink movie&quot; (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 毷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>; refers to a large number of Famous for movies that feature nudity&lt;/span>;). On December 4, 1955, Yojiro Takita was born in Takaoka City, Toyama Prefecture, Japan. In 1973, after graduating from Takaoka Commercial High School, he went to Tokyo to pursue his dream. At the age of 20, he joined Lion Film Production Company as an assistant director. In 1981, he directed his debut film &quot;Crazy Female Teacher&quot;. In the next five years, he filmed 21 pink movies mainly in the &quot;Crazy Train&quot; series. Although this type of film uses female nudity and male-female sex as gimmicks, its themes are diverse, including serious dramas, light comedies, and even suspense dramas. The whimsy and fun of Takita&#39;s works earned him the nickname &quot;Pink Movie Genius&quot; . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“At that time, the sun was setting in the Japanese film industry, and audiences rarely went to the movies. Some people watched pink movies, but the market demanded that filming be completed quickly at a very low cost. Many people wanted to make movies but had nowhere to go. Those who could go joined the ranks. There are too many people in the world who are determined to make movies, and I am one of them.&quot; Takita Yojiro recalled. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At that time, he worked 15 hours a day and was bored with 35mm film all day long. When he was young, Takita Yojiro often went to the cinema with his family, and movies would be shown in the school gymnasium. He would often watch and think, &quot;Isn&#39;t this movie about me?&quot; But he didn&#39;t know what it would be like to actually make a movie. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/z3AQzEGsca2WVookeTY0oQdMPDJy2LpmngedtBKC.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/z3AQzEGsca2WVookeTY0oQdMPDJy2LpmngedtBKC.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256532&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&quot;The Embalmer&quot; &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Even such a person who is full of anxiety and uncertain future I am willing to invest alone in the world. I believe that only those who are exposed to this world and discover something about themselves after going through hardships can survive.&quot; Yojiro Takita said, &quot;There are no rules to follow in anything. At that time, living in this world , can’t see dreams, and feels that having dreams is a luxury. All he can do is work hard to complete the things in front of him.&quot; He remembered the words of a senior director he knew well - he hoped that he would be entangled in film and die. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Being surrounded by film, I deeply understand the meaning of film and movies. As well as editing, I understand the importance of frame by frame. In these senses, the era of pink movies is My origin. Although it was very painful at the time, there were many happy partners. We cried together, laughed together, and drank together.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Takita Yojiro once described his works as &quot;Kintaro candy&quot;. Kintaro candy is a candy that Japanese children use on the Seven-Five-Three Festival (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 凯体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Similar to Children&#39;s Day, celebrating the growth of children aged 3, 5, and 7 years old&lt;/span>;) The edible candies come in a variety of patterns, and are &quot;long, sweet candies&quot; that need to be cut off bit by bit to eat. No matter where this candy is cut, the cross-section pattern is the same, only the outermost layer is different in color. He believes that although his works have various themes, when you really cut them apart, they are all the same movies. In his conversation with Takita Yojiro, the writer Zhian summarized this similar core as: about how ordinary people can prove themselves and realize their own value through an action. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It was also during that conversation that Yojiro Takita looked back on his career and lamented that he had always carefully selected job offers and rejected many works. Now he is more concerned about &quot;Why are you looking for me? What is the reason for choosing me to be the director?&quot; If there are consistent answers to the two questions, he will happily accept it. The next piece &quot;Smell the Smoke&quot; is the result of this thinking. This is a Chinese movie, with all Chinese actors, and he wanted to do something fun. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;As a director, I need to run around and be busy, but at the same time, I am also observing myself objectively. For example, sitting here for an interview, there is actually someone I am standing on high, looking down at. I am thinking about myself. In my head, on the one hand, there is this objective consciousness of always reflecting on myself, and on the other hand, I am rushing forward like a wild boar, running straight towards the goal.&quot; said Yojiro Takita. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before leaving for filming, his wife did not say to him, &quot;Come back after making a good movie.&quot; Instead, she told him: &quot;Don&#39;t get angry in front of everyone.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Movie Good or bad, people don&#39;t care.&quot; Takita Yojiro said with a smile. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In July 2019, we had the opportunity to watch an early version of the movie &quot;The Thing My Dad Didn&#39;t Tell&quot; and interviewed Yojiro Takita. In the interview, he talked about his motivation for making Chinese movies and his understanding of the film. Views on traditional disorder, the film’s response to changes in the times and people’s hearts, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/hlPeUhICHI8ykpivggrbRqJ3WevCr9upoDyNx1bn.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;659&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/hlPeUhICHI8ykpivggrbRqJ3WevCr9upoDyNx1bn.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256533&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&quot;Onmyoji&quot; &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The following is a dialogue with Yojiro Takita:&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;A story about reconciliation and rebirth&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Just listened to the staff After reading the novel &quot;Smell the Smoke&quot;, you felt that the story was actually a bit Japanese. What parts of it touched you and made you decide to film it? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Takita Yojiro:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;The family structure of China and Japan is very similar. The father is the backbone of the entire family, so daily life, father-son relationship, Cultural inheritance will also have many similarities. The original setting is a story that happened in a small town in China. This story can be copied to the Japanese countryside. This made me feel very familiar, and it was one of the motivations for me to try to make this film. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;My personal favorite is that the father has been keeping secrets and sticking to himself, and his intentions were only felt by his son after he passed away. This misunderstanding, sadness, and ultimate mutual recognition is what captures my heart the most. In other words, this is a story about reconciliation and rebirth. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Like the novel, you still use the son&#39;s perspective to construct the story Why did you choose this perspective on the relationship between father and son? And why make such a movie in modern times? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Takita Yojiro:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I was still thinking about this issue until yesterday. In fact, as we grow older, people’s way of thinking will become more and more fixed. and limitations, the scope of action may become narrower and narrower. The world of young people is more interesting, they have many expectations for life, there are incompleteness and immaturity, and the collision of various elements will lead to the development of the story. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, this also depends on the background of the times and career settings. Japan has many old shops that have been inherited from generation to generation, and there are also many stories about craftsmen. The world of traditional crafts is a world where seniors and juniors fight, because values ​​​​are different from the times, and it is inevitable for juniors to want to surpass their seniors. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I wonder if it is the same in China. Therefore, this story is set before the 2008 Beijing Olympics. The economy is growing rapidly, people&#39;s economic activities are becoming more and more important to the world, and in order to successfully integrate into the modern world, the traditional world is gradually losing order. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;What do you think of these? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Takita Yojiro:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I think this is not a good thing from the perspective of changes in values ​​and the changes that follow. Everything is digital now and you want fast results. People always think that when they do something, the result is there and they can get there quickly. But traditional craftsman-style things are just the opposite. Through accumulation, various techniques are passed on, and ways of thinking and feelings are refined. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, this 6cm×6cm camera (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;points at the photojournalist’s medium format film camera&lt;/span >;), it has existed a long time ago, 40 years ago, it is very rare, and it is still in use. There must be something in it that you want to stick to. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Japan held the Olympic Games in 1964, which was very similar to China. It developed rapidly after that. It’s just that the speed of development was “additive” at that time, but now it feels like “multiplicative”. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You graduated from high school a few years after the Japan Olympics. There are reports that you were faced with two directions at that time, whether to find a job directly or continue studying. So did you feel confused in the accelerating social environment? What was your state at that time, and why did you go to Tokyo? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Takita Yojiro: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Because I didn’t pass the college entrance examination, it doesn’t matter if I tell you. (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;laugh&lt;/span>;) I was very confused, and for the first time I realized, what have I been doing for so many years? I&#39;m very lonely. Like Jian San (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Yu Jian San, the male protagonist of &quot;Smell the Smoke&quot;&lt;/span>;), I also grew up in a small place, so I just wanted to stop staying there and go to Tokyo. I thought I would find something in the city. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After I went there, the level of prosperity and the number of people were completely different, and there were no parents nagging you behind your back. It felt like heaven. So when I first started working as a director, I shot all the cities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But as I got married and had children, the entire film industry environment changed, and the depth and breadth of my interactions changed, I began to realize that my hometown before I was 18 years old was something I couldn’t forget, including &quot;The Embalmer&quot; also has the feeling of returning to a small town. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;What are those unforgettable things? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Takita Yojiro: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;The terraced fields, the smell of the river, the light miso soup, udon noodles, the smell of my parents’ house, my mother’s smell.

It was only after I entered this industry that I found it interesting. Everyone has always believed that the world of entertainment and movies, including singing, is the domain of a few or special people. About half a year to a year later, I discovered that this was not the case. Whether it was lighting or photography, they were actually just people who were passionate about something. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this case, can I also make this thing? I worked very hard and studied a lot about movies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Do you still remember what happened on the first day you entered the set? ? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Takita Yojiro: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I just looked at it blankly, didn’t understand anything, and kept getting scolded.

Many people enter the film industry with aspirations, but once they arrive on set, they feel a lot of physical and interpersonal fatigue. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The film industry has been in recession for a long time, with little funding, low income, no future, and hard work. But there are many things that even quitting can&#39;t do anything about. What can I do if I don&#39;t do this? I feel like quitting is just an escape. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To use a Japanese proverb, this industry is like water, and I happen to be a fish. I am in it like a fish in water, which is very interesting.

After the bubble economy burst, many major events occurred in Japan, such as the Great Hanshin Earthquake. So, for a while, people who were very driven became insubstantial. Nothingness, nothingness, in short, the belief that life and the world are nothingness. I will think about what we live for? The works from that time also wanted to ask what the meaning of survival is. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Life can sometimes be a comedy. A person has many sides, depending on the perspective from which he is viewed. Sometimes the person is serious, like a school teacher, sometimes not. People in life always have both sides. I actually think everything can be a comedy depending on the content of the movie and the angle of editing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Also, I really like comedy.

This is not an escape, but another form of realization of the ideal. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In reality, when traditions are disappearing and have disappeared, historical dramas often focus on the beauty, tradition and etiquette of people.

The fellow pointed forward with his hand. Yang Ping asked again: &quot;Are there any paintings on the walls in the temple?&quot; Yang Ping&#39;s Shanxi dialect is a bit different from that of his fellow villagers, but it does not hinder their communication.要跑遍山西的角角落落，没有这样的语言优势，杨平还真拍不到那些庙里的“画画”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;提起山西壁画，人们总会想起岩山寺、永乐宫这样精美的宋元壁画，但很多人不知道，隐藏在山水之间的山西村落，保存着大量的村庙壁画。比起宋元壁画“享受”到的保护、研究和世人的赞叹，村庙里的壁画显得有些落寞。它们一般都是清代的遗存，“这些清代壁画，不用说&#39;国保&#39;了，连&#39;村保&#39;都不是。”杨平说。它们安静地扮演着村庄神祇塑像的背景，也是村民们生活里的一抹情趣。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/4WPb35vrq7unwyIJyFbvksl88V1sE1awKw9eZ4uA.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;577&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/4WPb35vrq7unwyIJyFbvksl88V1sE1awKw9eZ4uA.jpg&quot;

&lt;p>;杨平早年是旅行杂志的主编，杂志停刊后，她把精力完全放在山西的壁画和彩塑上。这些年来，她拍了山西四百多处壁画，其中明清的占了三百多处，“我知道但还没有拍的大约还有二三十处”。 《高堂粉墙烛下见——中国山西乡村古壁画探幽》是她2023年出版的新书，里面收录的21处精美的村庙壁画，大多是清代晚期的，其中很多都是她首次发现的。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;打开这本小书，一种与宋元壁画的高古、宏大完全不同的艺术气质扑面而来，秾丽的色彩、富有生活气息的神祇形象、小巧紧凑的构图，无不昭示着这是来自民间草根的审美情趣。杨平给这21处壁画写了21个小故事，大多是她与村民的聊天，家长里短，乡野旧闻，写来轻松有趣，但是在采访中，杨平说得更多的却是拍摄背后的甘苦，以及她对乡村壁画的种种忧思。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“每个时代遗留下来的文化，都反映了那个时代。乡村壁画不仅仅是艺术的呈现，里面还有很多历史信息。这本书的言外之意，其实在壁画之外。”杨平说。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“带回来的片子，几乎全部作废”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;杨平的老家是山西晋城，晋城以古建筑闻名。 2003年，杨平自己掏出36万元，开始拍摄晋城的古建筑。建筑拍得多了，她渐渐地对建筑内部的壁画产生了兴趣。别看她现在成天往村子里跑，瞧着灰头土脸，但她说其实自己最爱打扮，以前做时尚旅行杂志，喜欢漂亮衣服，最初爱上壁画，也是因为壁画的美。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2012年，杨平得到了一个机会，可以拍摄山西各地的壁画和彩塑。当时她只知道那些在文物名录上的壁画，至于山西到底有多少壁画，她并不清楚。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一开始没有拍壁画的经验，杨平向山西撒了一张大网：山西十一个地级行政区，每个行政区派一支摄影队，每队至少三人，由一位知名摄影家领衔，加一个灯光、一个司机，打算对全山西的壁画、彩塑进行地毯式拍摄。这是一项庞大的工程，花费不菲，但效果却令人大失所望。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“带回来的片子，几乎全部作废。”杨平想起当时自己的“莽撞”，不自觉露出苦笑。当年杨平请来的摄影师都是行业里的“大腕”，“他们对怎样拍得好看有自己的认知。你说拍成这样，他认为那样的才好看。而且很多他们觉得不好看的就不拍。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但是忠实地记录与“拍得好看”是两回事。要忠实地记录一铺壁画的全貌和其中的每个细节，每张照片的像素就要足够大，这就需要对一铺壁画进行分区拍摄。然而印制到书本上的壁画至少需要有一幅是完整的，这就又要保证每部分拍回来的照片都是可拼合的，也就意味着拍摄同一铺壁画的不同部分，其拍摄角度、像素、光线、曝光度，都要做到尽量一致。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/ruLSclr85wZI8HAUe5EalhAWw0fIVDu2VWY8I9kT.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;520&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/ruLSclr85wZI8HAUe5EalhAWw0fIVDu2VWY8I9kT.jpg&quot;

&lt;p>;还有些三四米高的壁画，如果梯子不够高，摄影角度的变化就会造成画面的畸变，也是“合不了”。 “一看这个图片不行，回来培训，又去拍，还不行，就买很多书给大家看……”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这次不成功的地毯式拍摄让杨平赔了很多钱，十一支摄影队的仪器、差旅、人工，全打了水漂。到后来，她意识到，不是摄影队越多就效率越高，掌握拍摄的准则才是最关键的。她把摄影队缩小到了两支，其中一支就由她自己来拍。面对一铺壁画，要形成比较标准的拍摄流程：大小的梯子必须要有，对墙壁进行分区的红外线仪也要有，镜头是标准的蔡司50，还要有一个手持的小相机，“很多塑像离壁画很近，手要伸进去拍”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;拍村里的壁画，除了这些一般的设备之外，铁锹和鸡毛掸子也是必备的，后者用来拂去壁画上的灰尘，前者则是修路的工具，“通往村里的是土路，用得上”。有一次到吕梁的一个村子，路况糟糕，摄影师用铁锹铲了一个多小时，才铲出一条“路”来。最后三百米，实在是没办法，只能大小器材都扛着走进村。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“三十年前题记还在”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;走进杨平的工作室，首先看见的就是一整排山西寺观壁画的图册。 《岩山寺》《开化寺》《公主寺》……这些在壁画史上赫赫有名的寺观，杨平都相应做了极为精细的图册。这些图册是她十几年来拍摄壁画的成果之一。在她之前，当然也有人拍过它们，也出过很多图册，但她想要做的是把每个细节都拍清楚。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“像这本《岩山寺》就拍了三年，2013、2014、2015年，陆陆续续拍，每次都要补拍，出版的时候发现某块不够清晰，就重新拍。”杨平说。岩山寺的金代壁画被誉为壁上的《清明上河图》，人物繁多，细节丰富，浓郁的生活气息就隐藏在画面细节之中。杨平的要求是画面上每个人物的身份、每个佛道故事的典故，乃至对首饰名物的辨认，不仅要有清晰的图像，还要附有学术文字的解释。所以她做的图册比前人要厚很多，八开本的一大本《岩山寺》厚达三百多页。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;到2013年冬天，像岩山寺、开化寺这样的“国保”“省保”，差不多都被她拍完了，杨平开始系统地拍摄村庙里的壁画。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一开始，对于村庙壁画，杨平只是路过的时候顺手拍，但拍得多了，她慢慢意识到，村里的明清壁画，比起宋元壁画，自有它的价值，完全值得再去搜罗一遍。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;山西古村落里，民间信仰的庙宇有着很多常见的神祇，关帝庙、娘娘庙（三霄娘娘）、龙王庙、马王庙、东岳庙，它们可能会单独出现，也可能会“组团”出现——即在一个庙中分布于不同的配殿里。龙王保佑风调雨顺、娘娘保佑生育平安、关帝则保佑教育子女忠孝节义。 “生娃、教育、农业，都是老百姓的真实需求。”杨平说。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/nAoCHFdPsyZq5m4VME0tVCyVxjQOKv6ItbDRTd0c.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/nAoCHFdPsyZq5m4VME0tVCyVxjQOKv6ItbDRTd0c.jpg&quot;

&lt;p>;旧时，这尊东岳神每年都要抬出来游街，近些年，这个仪式已经渐渐消逝，但村里老人还是担心，像这样不合常规地抬出来，会造成不祥。 “他们担心会引起暴雨。”杨平说。几十年没动过的木胎泥塑，移动稍有不慎，表面很可能就会碎裂。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;好不容易说服了村民，具体要怎么搬，杨平自己心里也没有底。几个人正围着神像急得团团转的时候，村里的一位老人站了出来，只见他拿着一根粗麻绳，用一种从来没见过的打结方式，快速将神像捆得四平八稳，四个人一抬，上下不会倾斜，左右也不会侧翻。 “要是没有这位老人的帮忙，我们真拍不到这样好看的照片。”杨平指着图册上的这页彩塑说。拍完后，东岳神被重新安放了回去，当然，村里也没有下起暴雨。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;时间在流逝，壁画和彩塑也随着时间在改变。很多壁画和杨平最初看到它们的时候已经完全不一样了。 “我知道的一堂宋代壁画，三十年前题记还在，现在某些题记已经模糊了。”而一些无人关注的清代壁画，已经再也看不到了。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;《高堂粉墙烛下见》里提到的罗圈堡村是其中幸运的一个。当时，当地文物局听从了杨平的建议，把村庙修缮一新，壁画也重新做了拼合。 2021年杨平回访的时候，罗圈堡的壁画都还完好。但是像罗圈堡这样的例子实在太少了。作为文物大省，山西要用到钱的文物非常多，村庙里的壁画，似乎还排不上号。 “山西文物部门经常开玩笑说，让他们开两家银行，可能也不够。”杨平说。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/Gr4E9FQvqA3u9Yl51rIzpBfvLnJ9PrKBCu4VTIUQ.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;641&quot; height=&quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/Gr4E9FQvqA3u9Yl51rIzpBfvLnJ9PrKBCu4VTIUQ.jpg&quot;

&lt;p>;到底要不要将村庙壁画出版，公之于众，杨平曾经犹豫过很久。 2016年，他们在太原附近的一个村子拍摄，摄影师被当地村民给撵走了。杨平非常理解老百姓的“警惕”：“文物贩子实在是太多了。”村庙里的壁画，一般连文保点都不是，官方的保护体系鞭长莫及，它们虽躲在深山，却躲不过文物贩子的“勤奋”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;某种意义上来说，杨平就是在和文物贩子赛跑，“你完全想象不到他们有多&#39;勤奋&#39;，十年前我去的山沟里，文物贩子都走过。”杨平的朋友圈本来是完全开放的，自己看到了什么、拍到了什么，都会发在朋友圈，但不会发具体地址。有一次，一位朋友从外省追了过来，和她打听，“杨老师，你朋友圈里的东西，能不能给我一个地址？”杨平随即警惕了起来，对那位朋友说：“我手里的东西，你一个石头也不能拿走。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但是在这本《高堂粉墙烛下见》里，很多村庙却写了详细的地址。杨平说，这也是她思考了很久之后的无奈之举。一方面，把它们隐藏得再好，可能也逃不过文物贩子的搜索，而且就算文物贩子没有找到，书中多数村庙都已经半坍塌了，这样隐藏下去，等待它们的命运也是逐渐湮灭。 “不如公开它们的状况，引起全社会的重视，唤起村民的保护意识。”杨平明确知道一个英国的银行家家里，收藏有一铺清代的壁画，“我们的研究者目前也大多关心更高古的宋元壁画，清代壁画无人关心”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;宋晓丽是杨平这本书的读者，2023年9月，她沿着书中的路线，走访了书中的几个村庄。她发现，很多村民的保护意识，确实比杨平拍摄时提高了不少。比如在瓦窑头村的龙王庙，“村民们有了保护意识，他们用厚厚的塑料布遮挡着壁画，我们拍摄完毕后又原样子给挡上，这是令人欣慰的发现。”宋晓丽告诉南方周末记者。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;然而，也有不幸的例子。书中提到的北曹村壁画，有非常生动的“龙王行雨图”。 “北曹村的龙王庙修缮一新，庙前立了文保碑，但是龙王殿里东西壁的龙王行雨图丢失了，文保部门将两幅喷绘的展示图分别悬挂于东西两壁。”宋晓丽说。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/XMsmu8OOO2pbwAv8zInikH6YVarxqHxkjN6B2KS6.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/XMsmu8OOO2pbwAv8zInikH6YVarxqHxkjN6B2KS6.jpg&quot;

&lt;p>;《高堂粉墙烛下见》卖得很好，有一点出乎杨平的意料。相对于她的整个出版计划来说，这本小书只展现了她工作的小小侧面。 “你做了这么多事情，没有人知道你在干什么，它老不冒火花，不冒泡。突然在这本书上红了。”书里的彩图，对于那些已经湮灭的壁画来说，是珍贵的记录。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;杨平最花心力的一套大书，是即将出版的《山西寺观艺术全集》，“全集”包括《山西寺观彩塑全集》（十卷）和《山西寺观壁画全集》（二十卷），共三十卷。她多年来拍摄的所有彩塑和壁画，都会收录进去，这是真正第一种尽可能完整地收录山西壁画彩塑艺术的出版物。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;《全集》的受众是专业的研究者，《高堂粉墙烛下见》的受众则是普通读者，杨平希望这本小书可以成为一个支点，撬动一点公众的认知。 “其实我有一个发心，文化不仅要吸引文化人，还要吸引更多的普通人，文化应该要滋养人的。我们现在的文化只滋养了一小批人，这是不够的。”杨平说。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 09 Nov 2023 16:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[买了14幅“毒地”？陆家嘴向苏钢集团索赔百亿]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260262]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-09 15:30:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;span>;17 parcels of land purchased 7 years ago at a cost of 8.525 billion yuan, after 6 years of development It was discovered that 14 pieces of land were seriously polluted.

Lujiazui disclosed in the announcement that due to soil pollution problems, its subsidiaries have transferred Jiangsu Suzhou Iron and Steel Group Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as &quot;Suzhou Iron and Steel Group&quot;), Suzhou Environmental Science Institute, Suzhou Suzhou Environmental Technology Co., Ltd., Suzhou National The High-tech Industrial Development Zone Management Committee and the Suzhou Municipal Natural Resources and Planning Bureau went to court and recently received a written case acceptance notice from the Jiangsu Provincial Higher People&#39;s Court;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The second is Lujiazui’s claim amount is as high as 10 billion yuan.

The land purchased in Lujiazui was purchased in 2016, but the contaminated land was not discovered until 2022. By this time, a large number of businesses had been built. Did the pollutants affect the construction workers? Why has no problem of excessive pollution been found during construction site operations for 6 years? Have you tried other options before filing a lawsuit? Wait for questions to follow&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;br>;&lt;span>;On the afternoon of November 8, the Securities Affairs Department of Lujiazui Company responded to Nandu Bay Financial News: &quot;We have disclosed all matters related to soil pollution disputes in the announcement. , are not accepting interviews at the moment. Regarding the status of the projects such as the Reading School that have been delivered, from the perspective of disclosure, we do not need to disclose it.

At that time, the group publicly stated that the successful joint bid for 95% of the shares of Suzhou Green Bank would be conducive to further increasing the company&#39;s land reserves and expanding the company&#39;s development space. &quot;By actively implementing the &#39;going global&#39; strategy, we will further enhance the brand influence of Lujiazui commercial real estate and enhance The company&#39;s sustainable operating ability and profitability.&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;However, Lujiazui&#39;s bold &quot;going out&quot; investment decision was not so smooth sailing. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In 2021, news spread that Suzhou Green Bank accidentally discovered that some plots of the project had serious pollution risks, and a report was made to the local government departments. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In April 2022, the &quot;Processing Status of the Sixth Batch of Letters and Calls Transferred to Our Province by the Second Central Ecological and Environmental Protection Inspection Team&quot; announced on the official website of the Jiangsu Provincial People&#39;s Government mentioned Recently, the test results of a third-party testing agency showed that benzopyrene and naphthalene in the soil of many plots of the Suzhou Green Bank project seriously exceeded the standards and did not meet the land use standards. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;It also mentioned that the Suzhou High-tech Zone Management Committee attached great importance to it, established a special work team, and quickly started work, requiring Suzhou Green Bank to effectively perform its main responsibilities. Before the end of June, a third-party agency will be entrusted to complete the formulation of a soil pollution investigation plan, and the organization and implementation will be organized and implemented. Related work will be carried out in accordance with the law based on the investigation results. During this period, the above-mentioned plots shall not carry out any activities unrelated to the prevention and control of soil pollution. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In the same month, Lujiazui also issued an announcement stating that 8 of the 17 plots of land have been developed. It was unexpectedly discovered that plots 2 and 13 where educational facilities have been built and plots 3 and 4 that have not been developed yet have serious pollution risks. Many elements in the soil or groundwater greatly exceed the standards and do not meet the original requirements of these plots. According to the planned land use standards, the total area of ​​the four plots is approximately 118,000 square meters. As of the end of 2021, the cumulative project investment in the four plots is approximately 450 million yuan&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Due to the exposure of land pollution problems, the Lujiazui project had to be stopped. &lt;span>;Public information shows that the above-mentioned land No. 2 and land No. 13, where the pollution was determined, are planned to build Suzhou Reading School and a kindergarten respectively. &lt;/span>;When they were named by the Central Second Ecological Environmental Protection Inspection Group in 2022, the two plots of land had been completed.

Huge legal risks and legal liabilities, and the Suzhou Iron and Steel Group, appraisal institutions, etc. in this incident will also have corresponding legal risks and legal liabilities. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;It further stated that as far as Lujiazui Group is concerned, according to the current information, it has a large scale of construction, many types of projects, and a huge amount of capital investment in the land involved in the case. , and related projects were found to have serious pollution in the land during construction, completion, sales and other aspects. Construction suspension, completion acceptance failure, sales suspension, rectification and repair, re-appraisal, etc. are all problems that Lujiazui Group is currently facing or will need to face in the future.

Investors are more assured when such things happen, and proactive disclosure of information makes investors feel more at ease.&quot; &quot;Lujiazui still has a conscience. No more false reports were issued to defraud property owners into purchasing their homes.” &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>; Regarding whether the case will have an impact on the company’s operations, Lujiazui mentioned in an announcement on November 4 that the case is still in the filing and acceptance stage, and it is temporarily unable to judge whether it will affect the company’s operations. The impact on the company’s profits for the current period or subsequent periods. According to relevant media reports, Lujiazui Chairman Xu Erjin said at the performance briefing on November 6 that the company’s special working group is going all out to carry out disposal and rights protection work, and promote relevant responsible parties to assume subsequent disposal responsibilities. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Xu Erjin also emphasized at the performance meeting that in the future, the company will pay close attention to the market situation in the Yangtze River Delta, choose opportunities to participate, continue to actively support the integrated development and construction of the Yangtze River Delta, and continue to strengthen Optimize the company&#39;s main business. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Although the company still has confidence in investment, it is undeniable that from the data point of view, Lujiazui has experienced a continuous double decline in operating income and net profit. According to the financial report, in 2022, Lujiazui achieved revenue of 11.762 billion yuan, a year-on-year decrease of 15.21%; net profit was 1.085 billion yuan, a year-on-year decrease of 74.84%; revenue in the first three quarters of 2023 was approximately 5.775 billion yuan, a year-on-year decrease of 14.48%; attributable to listing The company&#39;s shareholders&#39; net profit was approximately 837 million yuan, a year-on-year decrease of 27.75%. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The decline in Lujiazui’s performance is not unrelated to the fact that the current real estate market is still at a trough. In the first three quarters of this year, the national real estate development investment was 8,726.9 billion yuan, a year-on-year decrease of 9.1%; the commercial housing sales area was 848.06 million square meters, a year-on-year decrease of 7.5%. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;“Land pollution has devalued, the real estate market has declined, and forced development is unprofitable.” Some people in the industry believe that the main reason for this case to surface is due to multiple factors Impact. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The emergence of this case also triggered a new round of discussion on land development in the real estate industry. &quot;In the past 20 years of working in the industry, I have never seen a lawsuit like the tens of billions of land withdrawals due to soil pollution.&quot; Zhang Hongwei, founder of Jingjian Consulting, said that the lawsuit has involved the two governments, so it is not easy to handle. However, the &quot;poisonous land&quot; has been delayed for seven years. It is hoped that through the coordination of relevant departments in Shanghai and Jiangsu, this problem can be fundamentally solved. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Yan Yuejin, research director of Yiju Research Institute, speculated that the case may also involve fraud and corruption, which obviously requires strict investigation. &quot;This incident also shows that in some years of radical real estate development, some land transfers did not follow the regulations and were transferred illegally, which caused many problems and infringed on the legitimate rights and interests of the people.&quot; He further pointed out that the industry needs to monitor industrial land Pay more attention to safety issues, and companies should be cautious about some sites with a history of industrial land development to prevent sequelae. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;On November 9, Lujiazui’s intraday price was 8.94 yuan per share, down 3.32%&lt;/span>;&lt;span>; &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 09 Nov 2023 15:55:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[作家做的事丨昼夜有时]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260204]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-09 15:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 11/08/OPZQPfGmKpkzdhhdwOeMj0xHzukNVQQo1yrwdngS.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;1303&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/OPZQPfGmKpkzdhhdwOeMj0xHzukNVQQ o1yrwdngS. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;257539&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Mother&#39;s magic shoes. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Earlier, I was talking about that before she got sick, she wore the Leviathan sold by Azhen Pei magic shoes. In fact, she was already feeling uncomfortable at that time. She was lethargic, had diarrhea and had a fever. Maybe cancer cells were growing wildly in her body, but no one knew it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She said they were a pair of magical shoes. A pair sells for MYR 2,200. Azhen allowed her to take the shoes home first and try them on for a while before paying. She was satisfied, and perhaps felt she had taken advantage. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So she wore them out, to breakfast in town, to the store, and to her son&#39;s wedding in Taiwan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I almost fell!&quot; she once said to me. I don’t know whether it was because she was too weak at the time, or whether the shoes made her feet uncomfortable. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I never cared about those shoes. It was a place where people would believe in porcupine dates, talisman water and head-dropping magic. A pair of shoes is no big deal. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But those are no ordinary shoes. Azhen said that they were energy health shoes with super magnets. The soles of the shoes contained carefully blended Chinese medicine, which could open the second heart of the human body and stimulate the body&#39;s self-healing energy ring. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Health comes from wearing it&quot;, it says on the paper bag of the shoes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;By the time I saw those shoes, she was already a skinny, spiteful patient. She began to resent the shoes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Paradoxically, her friend Xiuli also suffers from cancer. But Xiuli didn&#39;t wear magic shoes. She ate the collagen powder sold by Azhen. They both eat it every day. That thing is quite troublesome, you have to eat it as soon as you get up, and the sooner you eat it, the better. Once, when we were traveling to Xi&#39;an, she got up before dawn to boil water and make collagen powder. After drinking it, she went back to bed to sleep. The buzzing sound from the hotel kettle made my second sister and I upset. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She didn’t want to see the pair of shoes, so she asked my sister and I to go to Azhen’s barber shop to return the shoes. She went to get a haircut that day, but she didn&#39;t go to Azhen&#39;s barber shop, nor to Alian&#39;s barber shop downstairs. She held an umbrella alone and walked to the barber shop upstairs in the back shop. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;My sister and I bravely walked into Azhen’s barber shop. Azhen was perming a woman&#39;s hair while talking to us. She showed us her and her daughter&#39;s shoes. They all wore black leather shoes that were exactly the same as their mother’s pair of Allipex magic shoes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Look, my daughter and I wear them. I stand and work all day long, and my feet are not sore at all!&quot; Azhen said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course the shoes cannot be returned. &quot;Who would buy it after they&#39;ve already been worn?&quot; Azhen rejected us. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A few days later, Xia Mu came to Ula Port, and his mother showed him the shoes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I tell you how these shoes are deceiving, you write it down and publish it in your newspaper.&quot; She said to Xia Mu. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Natsuki and I looked at each other, then took a look at the dull, ugly shoes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is what she thinks writers and journalists should do. She can’t seem to tell the difference between a reporter and a writer. In her opinion, they are all scholars and writers, and they should use their pens to speak out for others and plead for the people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I tell you, you write it down.&quot; That&#39;s what she said when she told me about her experience of nearly losing her life giving birth to her son. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She herself is such a person, keen on upholding justice and speaking for others, which is completely opposite to her husband. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For a period of time, in addition to working in the tailor shop, she was also busy applying for relief funds for the poor people passing through Hong Kong. She took a stack of application forms from the city council and distributed them to those who were struggling. When she met people who didn&#39;t know Malay, she asked her Malay friends to help fill out the forms because she didn&#39;t know much Malay herself. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She also called the newspaper office and applied for the newspaper office’s relief fund for her friend. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When she told me this, I was amazed at her ability and passion. I remembered something she said a long time ago. She said a fortune teller had predicted that if she continued to go to school, she would become a big shot like Li Jinshi. Li Jinshi was our former Minister of Health. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She is very proud. She walked around Port Ula like a country squire, like a big shot. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Soon her glory disappeared. She resented the magic shoes, resented her sister, and resented the person who deceived her. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The night before the first chemotherapy session, in a hotel near the hospital, in the early hours of the morning, after vomiting out all her dinner, she told me a story about a woman. The woman received relief funds through her help, but she discovered that she was not poor. She and her husband ran a seafood business in a town not far from the port of Ula. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I still have their business cards.&quot; She said. She decided to call the newspaper to expose the woman. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In less than a month, she herself became a person waiting for relief. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;My father said that she could apply for relief and that she should receive relief. So the city council came. The man was also my mother’s friend, and he had been handling the application forms submitted on my mother’s behalf. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Azmin looked at his mother with deep understanding and compassion. He made an immediate decision and suggested that I take a photo of my mother. The mother had to lie in bed so that her illness could be fully revealed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I did not take pictures of my mother. Xia Mu also did not write a report for her to expose the scam. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It was much later, five years after her death, that I thought I should search the Internet for introductions or news about magic shoes. I soon saw the report in Southern Metropolis Daily. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;That was a report in 2016. She wasn&#39;t sick yet. I was still teaching in school at that time. Two years later, I was no longer a teacher and she was a dying patient. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When she showed us those shoes, why didn’t we think of searching online? Isn’t this the instinct and ability of us scholars? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Maybe I don’t care how much she spent on a pair of shoes. Maybe I was already used to the fact that she was being fooled. It was a place where people believed in porcupine dates, talisman water and head-dropping magic. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I respect other people’s beliefs and lives, I always say this. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I have left Ula Port for a long time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;We don&#39;t need relief.&quot; We kids all thought so. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I did not take pictures of my mother. Besides, my mother was unwilling to lie on the bed and let someone take a photo of her shame and despair. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After her death, one Sunday afternoon, the second sister returned the pair of magic shoes to Azhen. She used the silk money she received from the funeral to pay Ah Zhen 2,200 ringgit. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After she died, I found a newspaper clipping in her drawer. That was the news about the &quot;Love in the World&quot; child sponsorship program in Sin Chew Daily on November 29, 2014. There are portraits of five sixth-grade students on the newspaper clipping. The title of the report is &quot;Repaying Sponsors with Good Results, Sin Chew Sponsored Students Achieve Excellent UPSR Results&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I thought they were all children passing through Hong Kong, children she had helped. no. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I know why she keeps that clipping. She loved stories like this, stories about struggle, hardship and reward, and gratitude. In the past, her children also received support from society with their excellent academic performance. She was proud of it, and she did not blush at all because of the deep aura of humility hidden in it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;That pair of magic shoes may be on a woman&#39;s feet right now. We no longer talk about those past events. But I never forgot them. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past, I didn’t do what a daughter could (should?) do, so now I do what a writer should do. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 09 Nov 2023 15:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[财政部通报460亿隐性债务案例，点名西安成都等地国企垫资]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260144]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-09 14:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;On November 6, the Ministry of Finance issued the &quot;Notice on Typical Cases of Local Government Hidden Debt Accountability&quot;, It notified 8 typical cases of hidden debt accountability investigated and dealt with since 2022, involving nearly 46 billion yuan in new hidden debt. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/07/86029ec6163e4aec5463b534412f9687.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;2254&quot; height=&quot;1222&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/07/86029ec6163e4aec5463b534412f9687.png&quot; data-key=&quot;257304&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;The targets of this notification involve some local governments, bank branches and state-owned enterprises, including: some areas in Hubei Province require provincial state-owned enterprises to advance capital for construction of new hidden debts, Liuzhou City in Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region requires state-owned enterprises Projects with advanced financing for construction should be arranged by the fiscal budget.

The witchcraft disaster occurred in the second year of Zhenghe (91 BC). ——Witchcraft was a popular method at that time to use witchcraft to curse others. A common method was to pierce small wooden figures and bury them in the ground. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sima Qian stated that the time when this incident occurred was not within the coverage of &quot;Historical Records&quot;. Even Ban Gu, who lived more than a hundred years later, probably because he was too sensitive, deliberately did not speak too clearly. In the biographies of the characters involved, the &quot;Hanshu&quot; talks so much that you can only read it after putting it together. Give a rough idea. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There was a man named Jiang Chong who frantically framed the prince for using witchcraft to curse Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty. The prince had no choice but to rebel. Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty asked Prime Minister Liu Quyou to command the army and fight the prince in Chang&#39;an City, and tens of thousands of people died. The prince was defeated and fled, eventually dying outside. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sima Qian had two good friends involved in this matter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One is Ren An, who was the &quot;envoy of the Northern Army&quot; at the time and controlled the largest army in Chang&#39;an City. When the prince rebelled, he sent a military talisman in an attempt to transfer troops to Ren An, but Ren An stayed behind closed doors after receiving the military talisman. This matter was considered by Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty to be &quot;double-minded&quot;, so Ren An was beheaded by Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One is Tian Ren, who is the Secretary of the Prime Minister&#39;s Office (an official under the Prime Minister&#39;s Office, responsible for supervising lawlessness, with a rank of two thousand stones, and is a senior official). At that time, he was assigned to guard the easternmost Fu&#39;an in the south of Chang&#39;an City. Door. The prince fled to this door, and he allowed the prince to escape. This crime is of course more serious and is also cut in half. Even the person who initially interceded for Tian Ren was so frightened that he committed suicide when Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty scolded him. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Sima Guang’s version: A traitor drives a wedge between father and son&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Sima Qian was working as a secretary to Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty at that time, but he could only watch his friend being executed and did not dare to Say more words. In fact, there are also some very fragmentary records of witchcraft cases in &quot;Historical Records&quot;, which basically do not talk about the incident itself, but mainly focus on the ending of the people involved. There are always different opinions on whether these contents were written by Sima Qian or added by later generations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the Song Dynasty more than a thousand years later, when Sima Guang wrote &quot;Zi Zhi Tong Jian&quot;, based on Ban Gu&#39;s outline, he finally provided us with a complete and logical account of the witchcraft incident. A narrative that is rigorous, coherent, with strong conflicts and rich in details. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This story tells the story of the conflict between a talented but cruel father and a less talented but kind-hearted prince. Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty hoped to finish all the most difficult things during his lifetime, leaving a country in need of rest and recuperation for his son to govern. This just happens to be the perfect combination. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, those who specifically helped Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty carry out brutal tasks knew that they would be doomed once the prince ascended the throne. So they tried every possible means to sabotage this plan. The most vicious one among them was Jiang Chong. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty hoped to reach an understanding with his son again and again, but treacherous ministers and villains pushed the prince to a dead end while sending the wrong message to Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty. Finally a catastrophe occurred. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After knowing the truth, Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty punished the treacherous minister and expressed his longing for the prince in his womb. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is a very sad, touching and educational story. Imagine that with Ban Gu&#39;s character, if you could read this story a thousand years later, you would probably express your appreciation instead of criticizing him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In recent years, many books and TV programs introducing Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty are based on the story of Sima Guang. Some people even extend it further, such as adding Sima Qian into this story. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Then, this version of a traitor driving a wedge between father and son is cute, but I’m afraid it’s not believable. In the following, we use historical data as a basis, combined with our understanding of the operation of power and human nature, to peel off the cocoons and present the truth of the witchcraft disaster as much as possible. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Liu Kun: Between Liu Zheng and Liu Fuling&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Let’s start with the son of Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty. In order to introduce the six sons of Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty, Ban Gu wrote &quot;Biography of the Five Sons of Wu&quot; and Sima Qian wrote &quot;The Family of Three Kings&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;The Biography of the Five Sons of Wu&quot; writes about the five sons of Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty, which is natural. Because there is another son, Emperor Zhao of Han, who inherited the throne, naturally he should not be placed with others. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;The Family of Three Kings&quot; only writes about three sons, which is a bit strange; and the content of this article is also very abnormal. It only copies the relevant documents when the three princes were canonized as princes and kings. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course there is a lot of debate as to why this is the case. But the title &quot;Family of Three Kings&quot; was decided by Sima Qian himself, there is no doubt about it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The three people mentioned in this article are: the second son of Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty, King Qi Liu Hong, the third son King Yan Liu Dan, and the fourth son King Guangling Liu Xu. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The three people not mentioned are: the eldest son Liu Zhi, the crown prince of Wei, the fifth son Liu Kun, the king of Changyi, and the youngest son Liu Fuling, who later became Emperor Zhao of Han Dynasty. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A simple explanation is that the first three were crowned kings on the same day in the sixth year of Yuanshou (117 BC), and no other people were involved. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But you can also make more complicated guesses: Ban Gu was from the Eastern Han Dynasty, so he naturally knew who succeeded him as emperor; Sima Qian was a person involved in the era of Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty. When he wrote &quot;The Family of Three Kings&quot;, he did not write All three of them have the possibility of inheriting the throne, and it is not appropriate to include them in the family. Even if the three people are included, it is inconvenient to say a lot of things. The only way to be safe is to copy official documents. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the eyes of many people, only Liu Zhi and Liu Fuling are important. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The eldest son Liu Ju was born in the first year of Yuanshuo (128 BC) and was regarded as the natural heir to the throne for a long time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The youngest son Liu Fuling was born in the third year of Taishi (94 BC), and finally won the victory in the competition for the throne. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The age of Liu Kun, the king of Changyi, was roughly twenty years younger than Liu Ju and more than ten years older than Liu Fuling. The information about him is almost blank even in the &quot;Book of Han&quot;. Because of this large blank, some people think that Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty never paid attention to him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But the blank space may also be due to sensitivity. After all, Liu Kun&#39;s mother was Mrs. Li, Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty&#39;s favorite woman, and Liu Kun&#39;s uncle was Li Guangli, who was madly throwing resources and opportunities at him. In addition, the time of Liu Kuang&#39;s death is also very sensitive. Different places in the &quot;Book of Han&quot; have slightly different accounts. Anyway, it was either before Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty died, or when Emperor Zhao of the Han Dynasty just ascended the throne. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“The beauty hidden in the golden house” is actually a political marriage&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;It is easy to put aside the folk gossip such as “the beauty hidden in the golden house” and only rely on &quot;Historical Records&quot; and &quot;Hanshu&quot; as the basis. We can conclude that Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty and his first queen, Chen, were completely political marriages. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Empress Chen&#39;s mother, Princess Guantao, was the sister of Emperor Jing of the Han Dynasty and the daughter of Empress Dowager Dou. She had huge political influence. It can be said that among the sons of Emperor Jing of the Han Dynasty, whoever married the daughter of Princess Guantao received important bonus points. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The mother of Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty cleverly seized the opportunity and facilitated this marriage. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the early days of Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty taking the throne, the power was in the hands of his grandmother, the Queen Mother Dou. Because of a reckless political reform, Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty was almost deposed. His ability to keep the throne was also related to the eldest princess. Because the old lady&#39;s favorite was this daughter (so she later &quot;leaves all the money and property of the Edom Palace to the eldest princess for prostitution&quot;), she does not need to care about this grandson (there are a lot of them anyway), but she cannot harm her daughter&#39;s son-in-law too much (if the daughter, If the granddaughter is very satisfied with him). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So later Princess Guantao could simply say: &quot;The emperor cannot be established except for me.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In other words, for a period of time, Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty could be said to be under Empress Chen under the protection of. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After Qian Gang&#39;s dictatorship, for a talented and arrogant emperor like Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty, I am afraid that when he thinks of this past event, he is not grateful, but humiliated. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Empress Chen simply did not understand the emperor&#39;s psychology and did not take care of his emotions. &quot;Historical Records&quot; said that she was &quot;arrogant&quot;, and &quot;Hanshu&quot; said that she was &quot;good at pampering and arrogant&quot;. This pampering probably does not mean doting, but means high status. Because the character of Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty is obviously that if you are arrogant because of my favor, it doesn&#39;t matter; if you are arrogant because of your status, it will be very serious. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So it is only a matter of time before the queen is deposed. In the case of deposing the queen, cruel officials like Zhang Tang must be sentenced severely and try their best to implicate the case. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In &quot;Historical Records&quot;, the queen of Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty was introduced as Wei Zifu at the beginning, and then used a narrative technique to tell everyone that Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty also had an empress Chen. This reflects the era of Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty. atmosphere. The &quot;Book of Han&quot; honestly follows the chronological order, and Empress Xiaowu Chen and Empress Xiaowuwei wrote it this way. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Prince Liu Zhi survived the first round of challenges&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;According to &quot;Historical Records&quot;, Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty seemed to only be so fond of his second queen, Wei Zifu. I suddenly saw her in a specific environment, liked her very much, and then brought her into the palace. Then I actually forgot about her for more than a year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But Wei Zifu was undoubtedly the lucky star of Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty. She brought Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty three daughters and one son, but more importantly, she also brought two dazzling famous generals, Wei Qing and Huo Qubing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the beginning, Wei Qing got the opportunity to lead troops in the war because he was the younger brother of Queen Wei Zifu; but within a few years, it probably became that because he was the sister of General Wei Qing, Wei Qing Zihu&#39;s status as queen was not shaken. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wei Qing has great martial arts skills and is irreplaceable; Wei Qing is also gentle and low-key, and is good at getting along well with all parties. In the sixth year of Yuanshuo (123 BC), Wei Qing took advantage of the remaining power of his two major victories over the Huns and humbly took out half of the reward given to him by the emperor to celebrate the birthday of the parents of Mrs. Wang, who was favored by Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty. Obviously, Mrs. Wang has posed a strong challenge to Wei Zifu&#39;s status. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the years when Mrs. Wang was favored, Sima Qian was working as a Langguan in the palace. Later, Mrs. Wang passed away, and a young alchemist from Qi called upon Mrs. Wang&#39;s spirit for Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty. Sima Qian also observed it at close range. He was obviously particularly impressed by how much Mrs. Wang was loved. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Mrs. Wang was also born at the wrong time. Her status in the heart of Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty may have surpassed that of Wei Zifu, but she was favored at the time when Wei Qing and Huo Qubing were indispensable to Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty. era. In the sixth year of Yuanshou (117 BC), before his death, Huo Qubing asked Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty to make three princes besides the prince king, and Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty agreed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sima Qian was known for his &quot;curiosity&quot;, but when it came to writing about the harem of Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty, he was quite strict. Therefore, some details have to be filled in by others: Mrs. Wang was ill at that time, and Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty asked her, where do you want me to seal your son? Mrs. Wang said about Luoyang, and Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty said that Luoyang was really not good, &quot;There is no country in Guandong that is larger than Qi. Qidong faces the sea and has a large city. In ancient times, it was alone in Ganzhong with 100,000 households. There is no country in the world that is richer than Qi.&quot; , let your son be the king of Qi. After Mrs. Wang passed away, Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty specially gave her the status of Queen Mother of King Qi. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If Chu Shaosunbu’s story is to be believed, if Mrs. Wang proposed to grant Luoyang to her son, then if her consciousness was not too low, then it was clearly out of anger; Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty seemed to feel a little guilty towards Mrs. Wang. , maybe he promised her something but failed to fulfill it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In any case, Wei Zifu and Prince Liu Zhi survived the first round of challenges. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The &quot;beautiful city and country&quot; Mrs. Li&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The next few years when Mrs. Li was most favored were roughly the Yuanfeng period (110 BC to 105 BC). During this period, Sima Qian After ending his career as a Langguan, he went to serve as Taishi Ling, and he distanced himself a little from the affairs in the palace. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The extent of Mrs. Li&#39;s favor cannot be seen from &quot;Historical Records&quot;. But when Ban Gu wrote about Mrs. Li, his heart was about to burst with gossip:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First, Ban Gu said that the first person whom Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty appreciated was Mrs. Li’s brother Li Yannian. Li Yannian sang such a song: &quot;There is a beautiful woman in the north, peerless and independent. She looks at the Qingren city and then the Qingren country. It is better not to know the Qingcheng and the Qingguo. It is hard to find a beautiful woman again!&quot; Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty sighed after hearing this and said Is there really such a beautiful person in the world? So Princess Pingyang, the sister of Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty (wei Zifu was also recommended by her, which was considered her profession) recommended Mrs. Li to Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty. From then on, Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty loved him very much. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Second, Ban Gu said that Mrs. Li was seriously ill and Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty came to see her. Mrs. Li covered herself in the quilt and said that I had been seriously ill for a long time and was &quot;disfigured&quot; and could not see the emperor. My wish was that the emperor could take good care of my son and brothers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty wanted to see Mrs. Li&#39;s face very much, but Mrs. Li refused. In the end, Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty left angrily. Mrs. Li&#39;s sisters blamed her, why did she make the emperor so angry? Mrs. Li said, I don&#39;t let the emperor see me as I am now, it is for the sake of my brother. &quot;A husband who treats others with sex will lose his lust and love to relax. If he loves to relax, he will not be kind.&quot; If he can&#39;t see me now, the emperor You will always remember my most beautiful appearance; when you see me now, you will only dislike me from now on. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This classic case is often cited. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Thirdly, the story about the young man summoning Mrs. Wang’s soul was taken by Ban Gu and placed in Mrs. Li’s body. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fourthly, Ban Gu said that after seeing Mrs. Li&#39;s soul, &quot;he wrote a poem of his own to mourn Mrs. Li.&quot; This is a very long piece with many difficult words to understand, so I won’t copy it here. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Everyone can make up gossip stories. Writing love poems for emperors is also a hobby of many literati. Therefore, the above four points recorded by Ban Gu are all true or false. Very adventurous. But again, there are so many jokes about Mrs. Li, which shows that in people&#39;s minds, Mrs. Li was the most important woman in the eyes of Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Moreover, if there is any doubt about the authenticity of the above things, then the following two things will never be ignored by a historian of Ban Gu’s level: First, after Mrs. Li’s death, “after the She was buried with the ceremony of a queen; secondly, after Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty passed away, Huo Guang knew the emperor&#39;s thoughts and &quot;used Mrs. Li as food, and she was given the honorary title of Queen Xiaowu.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Mrs. Li is treated as a queen, so what should her son be? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Also, the song &quot;Total Country and City&quot; sounds like a prophecy no matter how you listen to it. As we all know, Chinese history books have a characteristic. Prophecies may be made up, but once the prophecy is written down, it will come true. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So what kind of disastrous consequences did Mrs. Li cause to deserve such a prophecy that she would conquer the country and conquer the city? Of course, there is only the scourge of witchcraft. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The decline of Wei&#39;s relatives&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In fact, in the &quot;Book of Han&quot;, Ban Gu left many other clues, and these records happened to be able to compare with Sima Qian&#39;s previous history. Narrative, perfectly connected. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Let us return to the vulgar palace fight plot. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Compared with Mrs. Wang, Mrs. Li has the greatest luck: it is not that Wei Zifu has become older and more beautiful, but that the two obstacles of Wei Qing and Huo Qubing no longer exist. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Huo Qubing died in the sixth year of Yuanshou (117 BC). Although Wei Qing lived until the fifth year of Yuanfeng (106 BC), he never led an army. Because during the Yuanding and Yuanfeng years, the opponents faced by Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty were no longer the Xiongnu at their peak. For enemies like South Vietnam, East Vietnam, and North Korea, other generals are enough to control the situation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But this does not mean that the obstacles have been completely removed. The generals who are now active are also closely related to Wei Qing and Huo Qubing. Wei Qing brought out a dozen generals, and Huo Qubing trained two. General Han Henghai, who played an important role in destroying East Vietnam, said that General Xun Shen, who destroyed North Korea, as well as Gongsun He, Gongsun Ao and others, were all under Wei Qing&#39;s command at that time. Lu Bode, the general who destroyed South Vietnam, and Zhao Ponu, who captured King Loulan alive, came from the Huo Qubing system. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It can be seen that the so-called Wei Qing does not support scholar-bureaucrats, mainly refers to the fact that he does not support famous speakers, activists, and knights in Chang&#39;an City. After fighting for so many years and making decisive decisions in the army, of course he still You have to train your own team. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is also worth noting that the Li Guang family. Although Li Guang’s death is believed to be related to Wei Qing, and Li Guang’s son Li Gan is even believed to have died at the hands of Huo Qubing, the Li and Wei families quickly Relationships repaired. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Guang&#39;s cousin Li Cai got the title of marquis because he fought with Wei Qing; even Li Gan himself was able to &quot;confer the title of Marquis of Guannei&quot; under Huo Qubing. Then Li Gan&#39;s daughter became the favored woman of Prince Wei, and Li Gan&#39;s son Li Yu was also the favored subordinate of Prince Wei. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Are these people a political group? When Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty was around, and the status of the prince remained unshakable, it would not count, because the relationship between them was also complicated and full of contradictions; but if Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty changed the prince, they would be: because the new prince would have a new team, they would have to make room for them. seat. Just like back then, the conflict between Xiao He and Cao Shen was once great, but once Liu Bang wanted to abolish Emperor Hui of Han and replace Emperor Hui of Zhao with Liu Ruyi, they were old brothers in the same trench again. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The Li family’s relatives did not live up to expectations&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The following is a guess I made based on the above historical data:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yuan Feng (110 BC ~ 105 BC) In a certain year of , Mrs. Li passed away. From then on, she became the most beautiful image in the heart of Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty. Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty believed that Mrs. Li was the queen, so he wanted to change Liu Kun, the king of Changyi, to the crown prince. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty was about fifty years old at this time. His energy may not be as good as before, but he was undoubtedly more foresighted and sophisticated. He would not rush to express his position on such an important matter, and would not even reveal much of his thoughts. That would directly lead to the failure of the original military and political system, which is not worth it anyway. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the first year of Taichu (104 BC), Li Guangli was appointed as the general of the Second Division and commanded a war that lasted four years and overloaded the whole country. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, the war was going to be fought, but Li Guangli was in charge of it. To say that &quot;the noble prince favors his concubine Li&quot; is an understatement. I just want Li Guangli to be made a marquis, and let him cooperate with a general like Zhao Ponu to fight an easy war like the Loulan Conquest. The reason for making him a marquis is enough. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, in Li Guangli&#39;s headquarters, although the origins of Zhao Shicheng, Li Duo, and Shangguan Jie are not very clear, there are no veteran generals under Wei Qing and Huo Qubing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty wanted to cultivate a new military merit group led by Li Guangli and unrelated to Wei Qing and Huo Qubing. In this way, even if the prince changes in the future, it will not cause too much shock. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But Li Guangli was too unsatisfactory. The conquest of Dayuan was a tragic victory that outweighed the gains, and the defeat of the Huns was a disastrous defeat again and again. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, today&#39;s researchers may think that Li Guangli&#39;s ability is not that bad. The experience of later generations shows that the limit of the Central Plains dynasty&#39;s power to advance westward was the eastern foot of the Pamir Plateau. Li Guangli&#39;s conquest of Dayuan exceeded this limit. When fighting against the Xiongnu, the situation at this time was completely different from that during the Wei Qing and Huo Qubing era. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this era, the strategic advantages of the Han Dynasty were incomprehensible to the Huns, so no matter how they won the war, the Huns still sought peace talks with the Han Dynasty; It is almost impossible to explain: after the conquest of Dayuan, the problem of the Han Dynasty&#39;s shortage of horses was not alleviated but greatly intensified. The Huns&#39; mobility advantage became greater, so facing the Han army on the expedition, they only needed to avoid , snooping, tracking... Wait until you have to retreat, are close to home and are most exhausted, then suddenly launch a fatal blow. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So the wisest choice for the Han Dynasty was to defend and just watch the Central Plains get better day by day and the Xiongnu get worse day by day. But as long as the expedition is far away, replacing other generals will have no good results. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But not everyone will accept these views today, and people in the Han Dynasty would not think so. It is better to compare Li Guangli with Wei Qing and Huo Qubing. It is more in line with human nature to heal the past and harm the present. Even those who looked down on Wei and Huo back then, their current mentality is &quot;There is no need to go back to Wen Jingshi, looking back at Huolin is already a loss&quot;, right? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty was also gradually losing patience. It is a miracle that the emperor&#39;s love for a woman can last for so long. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the spring of the fourth year of the Han Dynasty (97 BC), Li Guangli once again conquered the Huns but failed. In the summer, Liu Kun was named the king of Changyi. Although it cannot be said that this is a determined fate, it is not a good sign after all. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Liu Fuling was born and &quot;Yao&#39;s mother gate&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In the third year of Taishi (94 BC), Gou Yi and Zhao Jieyu gave birth to the sixty-three-year-old Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty. A little prince Liu Fuling. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Talking about the story of Lady Gouyi Zhao Jieyu, Ban Gu started to indulge in gossip again: When Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty was patrolling through Hejian County, it was not the officials but the &quot;spiritual seekers&quot; who discovered this strange thing. woman. Her hands were naturally clenched into fists and could not be opened. Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty went up and touched them. Wow, the palms of the beautiful girl were open. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These are all clearly written by Ban Gu in the &quot;Book of Han·Biography of Wife&#39;s Relatives&quot;, and are almost exactly the same as the relevant content in &quot;The Story of Hanwu&quot;. &quot;The Story of Hanwu&quot; is pretended to be a work by Ban Gu, which is certainly not credible, but it is also unrealistic to think that Ban Gu wrote rigorous and precise history, while the other works are absurd novels. They are completely opposite. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Then, it is said that Zhao Jieyu was pregnant with Liu Fuling for fourteen months. Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty said that he heard that Yao also stayed in his mother&#39;s belly for fourteen months before being born. So the palace gate where Zhao Jieyu lived was named &quot;Yaomu Gate&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yao was a holy king in ancient times. He governed the world so well. Nowadays, another Yao is born in the world. Don’t you think it’s a pity that he is not allowed to become emperor? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this place, Sima Qian was actually quite cooperative with Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty. There are many legends about Yao. The version accepted by &quot;Historical Records&quot; is that Yao was the youngest son of Emperor Ku, and he succeeded to the throne of emperor after squeezing out all his brothers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In short, although the cinnabar mole in Mrs. Li&#39;s heart has not turned into mosquito blood, it does have a ray of fresh white moonlight shining into the emperor&#39;s life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So, it was not only Wei Zifu and the prince who were nervous at this time, but also Li Guangli, whose fate was firmly bound to his nephew. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Looking forward, the prince&#39;s back seems to be getting further and further away. Looking back, the contemporary Tang Yao is quickly approaching. If you don&#39;t want to be caught up by the person behind you, it&#39;s best to catch up with the person in front. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>; How close are fellow Zhao people? &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Mr. Fang Shiming is a senior scholar who is particularly good at discovering political groups based on people&#39;s place of origin. In traditional society, the relationship between people is particularly important except for blood ties. This method is of course not absolutely correct, but it does explain many problems. One of his papers teased out such a clue:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Mrs. Li and Li Guangli&#39;s family are &quot;Zhongshan old advocates&quot;. Zhongshan is surrounded by Zhao. &quot;Historical Records·Huo Shi Biography&quot; introduces the customs of the world, which is also I put Zhao and Zhongshan together. Therefore, people from Zhongshan and Zhao are both from their hometown. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Then let’s look at the characters who played an important role in forcing the prince to death in the witchcraft disaster:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The first is Prime Minister Liu Quya, who is the brother of Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty The son of Liu Sheng, Prince Jing of Zhongshan - there are so many &quot;after Liu Sheng, Prince Jing of Zhongshan&quot; in the history books. It is rare that this one is true. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is actually not easy for the sons of princes and kings to become high officials in the court. The &quot;Book of Han&quot; says that &quot;I don&#39;t know where it started&quot;, but it also tells us that Liu Quya and Li Guangli were not only fellow Zhongshan fellows, but also their sons and daughters. (&quot;The Biography of Liu Quya&quot;)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There were Hu cavalry stationed in Chang&#39;an City. When Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty and his son went to war, whoever could get the support of this army would win a key bargaining chip. The person who helped Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty kill the prince&#39;s envoy and take over the command of this army was called Ma Tong, who was the great-grandfather of Ma Yuan, General Fubo of the Eastern Han Dynasty. He had just moved to Maoling from Handan of Zhao State not long ago. living. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;And on the battlefield against the Huns, Ma Tong and Li Guangli fought together and had a close relationship. (&quot;Book of Han·Biography of the Xiongnu&quot;)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ma Tong&#39;s elder brother Ma Heluo was a good friend of Jiang Chong. (&quot;Book of Han·Jin Rixiu Biography&quot;)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, Jiang Chong bit the prince the hardest and was at the forefront. He was also from Handan, and the characteristics of their family were similar to those of the Zhongshan Li family. Likewise, he is also good at singing and dancing. As we all know, the entertainment industry has its own unique network of relationships. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Anyway, what is certain is that in the second year of Zhenghe (91 BC), the prince was forced to death. In the third year of Zhenghe (90 BC), Li Guangli led an army to attack the Huns. When they reached Weiqiao, Li Guangli Liu Quyou said to see him off: &quot;I hope that the king will ask the king of Changyi to be the crown prince. If he is established as the emperor, why should the king worry?&quot; They were the beneficiaries of this disaster. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But in this year, someone reported to Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty that Liu Qumo&#39;s wife was practicing witchcraft and cursing the emperor. Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty sent relevant departments to investigate and interrogate, and believed that &quot;the crime was a serious crime&quot;, so Liu Quyou&#39;s entire family was wiped out. Li Guangli, who was fighting against the Huns at the front, heard the news and knew that returning to the Han Dynasty was also a capital offense, so he surrendered to the Huns. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This matter sounds like Liu Quya’s wife is out of her mind. But the fact may be that Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty knew that the prince was framed by them. But there is no problem in blaming Jiang Chong for framing the prince, but blaming it on the prime minister and the general of the second division. A series of intrigues inside the palace will be exposed, and countless rumors will be spawned, so we find another reason to deal with them. Anyway, at this time, the crime of witchcraft is , just like talking about corruption today, it is basically a sure shot. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is not conjecture. In fact, Ban Gu wrote about it again. In the first year of Houyuan (88 BC), Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty was about to collapse, and he inadvertently told the truth:&lt;/p>; &lt; p>;The report said: &quot;I have been immoral. Since the Prime Minister Zuo (Liu Quyou) and the Second Master (Li Guangli) conspired to rebel, the disaster of witchcraft has spread to the scholar-bureaucrats...&quot; (&quot;Han Shu·Che Qianqiu Biography&quot;)&lt; /p>; &lt;p>;If the &quot;conspiracy to rebel&quot; refers to Liu Quyou&#39;s practice of witchcraft, then the matter did not &quot;reach the scholar-bureaucrats&quot;. It is only reasonable to understand that it means they framed the prince. Yan Shigu also understood it this way when he commented on the &quot;Book of Han&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It seems that the mastermind of this catastrophe in which the prince and queen were killed, tens of thousands of people were buried with them (original text of &quot;Han Shu&quot;: &quot;tens of thousands of zombies&quot;), and the capital was bloodied was actually Mrs. Li. Brother Li Guangli. According to the logic of &quot;beauties bring disaster,&quot; of course it is true that Mrs. Li &quot;overwhelms the country and the city&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;What kind of person is Prince Wei?&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;What is easier to judge is that the image of Prince Wei in &quot;Hanshu&quot; is indeed different from that in &quot;Zizhi Tongjian&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Zi Zhi Tong Jian&quot; says that the prince is &quot;benevolent, gentle and cautious&quot;, &quot;honest and quiet&quot;, this image does not exist in the &quot;Han Shu&quot;; &quot;all the ministers are generous and generous&quot; The situation of &quot;Prince&quot; is completely inconsistent with the description in &quot;Hanshu&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The most important introduction to Prince Wei in the &quot;Book of Han&quot; is this sentence:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The purpose of establishing Bowang Garden is to allow guests to communicate with each other and follow their preferences, so Most people enter with heresy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A large number of restless people gathered around the prince. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So in fact, the prince&#39;s team action ability is quite strong. If he felt that he was going to be framed by the envoys of Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty, he could react immediately, arresting those who could be caught and killing those who deserved to be killed, without any ambiguity at all. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Then organizing the armed forces was quite efficient: the prince seized the arsenal of Chang&#39;an City and armed his guests; mobilized the power of Changle Palace where Queen Wei Zifu lived; and then released the prisoners of Chang&#39;an City and awarded them arms. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, those who almost succeeded in mobilizing include: 1. Changshui Cavalry stationed in the southeast of Chang&#39;an and Xuanqu Cavalry stationed in the southwest of Chang&#39;an; 2. Ren&#39;an&#39;s Northern Army. According to the description in the &quot;Book of Han&quot;, the battle between Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty and Prince Wei for these two teams was a matter of a split second: Ma Tong arrived a little late, and the prince&#39;s subordinates were like Hou (this person&#39;s identity was actually a Prisoners) can mobilize the Hu cavalry; Ren An has served as the prince&#39;s young master, and if he is a little more loyal to the prince, he will not stay out of the matter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Had we not made plans for a rebellion long ago, conducted an in-depth and comprehensive investigation and analysis of the military forces available to Chang&#39;an City, and had detailed and well-planned deployments, it would be difficult to imagine such an action. efficiency. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Even after losing these two powerful armies, the prince&#39;s army still formed a strong combat effectiveness. Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty&#39;s army to counter the rebellion should be composed of elite doctors and guards, equipped with the most sophisticated crossbows of the Han Dynasty that even frightened the Xiongnu (so Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty emphasized not to engage in close combat), plus three The local troops of the auxiliary army fought like this for five days. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In short, his quick reactions, quick actions, and powerful combat show that Prince Wei is not a character who is easily bullied. Compared with Liu An, the king of Huainan who was said to want to rebel but was helpless, Liu An really should have invented a piece of tofu and killed himself. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ban Gu also made some interesting comments about the prince. When the prince was born, &quot;Chiyou&#39;s flag is as long as the sky.&quot; The so-called &quot;Chiyou&#39;s flag&quot; refers to the comet with a long tail in the sky. The ancients believed that this was a symbol of disaster in war. The Han Dynasty&#39;s war against the Xiongnu began, and the prince was born. After that, the war lasted for thirty years, and &quot;the soldiers slaughtered the barbarians and killed countless people.&quot; Then there was the great war and chaos in the capital. Therefore, &quot;The prince grew up with soldiers and ended with them.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Originally, reading this sentence just makes people think that Ban Gu is implying that the prince represents the flames of war and murderous intent. A sentence in the published &quot;Tsinghua Bamboo Slips·Five Chronicles&quot; suddenly made people realize: &quot;The Yellow Emperor had a son named Chiyou. When he grew up, he served as a soldier.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ban Gu was clearly saying, The prince is the incarnation of Chi You. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The few words about the prince in &quot;Historical Records&quot; do not indicate that Sima Qian had any closeness to the prince. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Thinking vulgarly, when the prince and Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty were fighting in Chang&#39;an, Sima Qian would probably rather Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty win, even if it was to save his own life. At this time, he was Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty&#39;s Zhongshu Ling. To put it bluntly, he was a eunuch who helped the emperor handle administrative affairs. If the prince won, everyone around the emperor would be destroyed, and Sima Qian would probably not be able to escape. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sima Qian’s friends Ren An and Tian Ren are not princelings in the strict sense. Tian Ren can be considered loyal to the prince, but his position is as an official of the Prime Minister&#39;s Palace (to be understood according to the thinking of spy war dramas, it should be said that the prince is a powerful figure); Ren An is even more suspicious, and he has received the prince&#39;s military talisman. When sending troops, Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty said that he was &quot;double-minded&quot;. In fact, he admitted that he was not a prince, and that he was also the leader of Xiongcai who had high demands on his ministers. According to ordinary people, if he did not move his troops at that time, he would still favor the emperor. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Other figures related to the prince:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sima Qian&#39;s impression of Wei Qing and Huo Qubing is known to be bad. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Shi De, the prince&#39;s teacher, is used by some scholars as an argument that &quot;the ministers who are generous and the elders all attach themselves to the prince&quot;. In fact, Sima Qian had some comments about Shi De: The ancestors of the Shi family were talented but not good at learning, but they were very cautious and cautious. After Shi De&#39;s father passed away, their family&#39;s &quot;filial piety and prudence gradually declined.&quot; This is not far from saying that Shi De is useless. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is also Li Guang&#39;s grandson, &quot;Yu dared to be favored by the prince, but he was fond of profit, and Li&#39;s mausoleum has declined slowly.&quot; Li Yu, who was favored by the prince, was a vulgar money addict in the eyes of Sima Qian , and is the unworthy descendant of his beloved flying general Li Guang. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The conflict between the prince and Emperor Wu of Han Dynasty broke out. To put it bluntly, it was just a struggle between two political forces. There was no &quot;battle between two lines&quot;, and there was no morality or ideal at all. But they have been forced to this point, and no one can retreat. What they are fighting for is not only the supreme imperial power, but also the humblest survival. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this way, if Sima Qian did not write about the disaster of witchcraft, he might as well give a literary explanation: his heroic and heroic pen could not face this era. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The era of Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty before Taichu in his works was, of course, full of violence and bloodstains, but there were also numerous heroes and heroes. Even the despicable and shameless characters he hated were still high-spirited and majestic. , this kind of afterglow shone into the Tianhan years, but by Taishi and Zhenghe, there was really only suffocating madness and calculation left. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The world has changed not because someone died, but because tonight&#39;s cold wind blew down the stars of last night, and the stars in the sky naturally and irrevocably dimmed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From this point of view, I would rather the story told by Sima Guang is true, and it seems to have a bit of idealism and family affection. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（本文仅为作者个人观点，不代表本报立场）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 09 Nov 2023 13:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[阿尔茨海默病年轻化来临？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260214]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-09 12:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Alzheimer&#39;s disease is often seen as a disease of the elderly, so young people suffer from Alzheimer&#39;s disease The disease will produce more interpretations. At the same time, new research has found that the simplest way to prevent the early onset or younger onset of Alzheimer&#39;s disease is to have a good night&#39;s sleep. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On January 31, 2023, Jia Jianping’s team at Xuanwu Hospital reported in the Journal of Alzheimer’s Disease that a patient developed memory impairment at the age of 17 and was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease at the age of 19. (AD) patients. This is the youngest patient to date. The patient suffered from memory loss, frequently lost personal belongings, could not remember whether he had eaten or not, and was ultimately unable to complete his studies and had to drop out of high school. Previously, patients younger than 30 years old have been reported, with the youngest age of onset being 21 years old. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the process of diagnosis and treatment of the patient, the research team found that the patient&#39;s main symptom was memory decline, especially episodic memory decline. Combined with the Wechsler Memory Scale and Auditory Word Learning Test assessment, the patient&#39;s main symptoms were memory decline, especially episodic memory decline. A diagnosis was made. However, the patient had no family history of hereditary disease and could not find other causes of memory impairment such as genetics, infections, and systemic diseases. After whole-genome sequencing, it was found that the patient did not carry any risk or pathogenic gene mutations, ruling out the possibility of familial Alzheimer&#39;s disease. Therefore, its pathogenesis requires further study. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, Alzheimer’s disease is not exclusive to the elderly, but young people can also get it. Currently, there are at least 50 million dementia patients worldwide, and it is expected that the number will reach 152 million by 2050, of which about 60%-70% are Alzheimer&#39;s disease patients. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Research on Alzheimer&#39;s disease has long been classified. The disease has a youthful form, but this is not an independent disease. Alzheimer&#39;s disease is classified according to the age at onset. A standard and a title. Alzheimer&#39;s disease is divided into early-onset Alzheimer&#39;s disease (also known as young-onset Alzheimer&#39;s disease) and late-onset Alzheimer&#39;s disease. Early-onset Alzheimer&#39;s disease refers to Alzheimer&#39;s disease that occurs in adults between the ages of 18 and 64, and those younger than 35 are called very early-onset Alzheimer&#39;s disease. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Age statistics of Alzheimer&#39;s disease patients in various countries around the world show that the average age of onset of the disease is 51 years old. Young-onset Alzheimer&#39;s disease accounts for 4%-6% of Alzheimer&#39;s disease. However, most cases of young-onset Alzheimer&#39;s disease develop between the ages of 45 and 65. Statistics in the United States show that the mortality rate of young-onset Alzheimer&#39;s disease among those aged 40-64 is 24.2%. Now, the 19-year-old patient diagnosed with Alzheimer&#39;s disease in China belongs to the ultra-early form. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Insight Report on the Needs of Alzheimer&#39;s Disease Patients&quot; released by the National Health Commission on September 20, 2023 pointed out that there are currently about 15.07 million dementia patients in China aged 60 and above, among which Alzheimer&#39;s patients There are 9.83 million patients with Alzheimer&#39;s disease, and it is expected that by 2050, the number of Alzheimer&#39;s patients will exceed 40 million. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As the prevalence of Alzheimer&#39;s disease continues to rise in China, this disease, which mainly affects people over 60 years old, has shown a new characteristic in China. The incidence of Alzheimer&#39;s disease is increasing among young people in China. . Reported statistics show that the incidence of Alzheimer&#39;s disease is 2.5% for those under 40 years old; 4.1% for 40-49 year olds; 14.7% for 50-59 year olds; 28.9% for 60-69 year olds; and 70-79 year olds. 33.2%; 16.6% for those aged 80 and above. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It can be seen that the high-risk group of the disease is 60-79 years old, accounting for 62.1%. Alzheimer&#39;s disease is said to have early onset when it occurs under the age of 60. In China, 21.3% of patients with Alzheimer&#39;s disease are under the age of 60. Compared with the international incidence rate of 5%-10% in this age group, China&#39;s early-onset incidence rate has increased significantly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Whether it is China or the United Nations standards, people under 50 years old are middle-aged and young people. China&#39;s &quot;Law of the People&#39;s Republic of China on the Protection of the Rights and Interests of the Elderly&quot; collectively refers to citizens over 60 years old as the elderly. However, according to the classification of life by the United Nations and World Health Organization in 2020, there are 5 stages. Minors: 0 to 17 years old; young people: 18 to 65 years old; middle-aged people: 66 to 79 years old; elderly: 80 to 99 years old; longevity elderly: over 100 years old. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If according to the new standards of the United Nations, 18-65 years old are all young people, then half of the patients with Alzheimer&#39;s disease in China may be young people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are many factors that contribute to the development of Alzheimer&#39;s disease, but taking one simple preventative approach can reduce the incidence and number of people affected by the disease. Some previous studies have found a link between napping and Alzheimer&#39;s disease. A long-term follow-up survey of the leisure activities and sleep conditions of more than 20,000 elderly people found that those who have the habit of napping have about a 37% lower risk of developing Alzheimer&#39;s disease than those who do not take naps. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, this was only a study of older adults. A recent study on young and middle-aged people found that as long as they have good deep sleep, they can effectively prevent Alzheimer&#39;s disease, especially the younger generation of the disease. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Researchers from the Framingham Heart Institute, the University of Texas and other centers in the United States have just published the results of a study in the Journal of the American Medical Association (&amp;nbsp;JAMA) showing that deep sleep helps To slow down brain aging, every 1% decrease in deep sleep per year is associated with a 27% increase in the risk of dementia, suggesting that maintaining deep sleep time can prevent Alzheimer&#39;s disease. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For this study, researchers used data from the Framingham Heart Study, a long-term, ongoing cardiovascular cohort study of residents of Framingham, Massachusetts. The study began in 1948 with 5,209 adults in Framingham and has continued for more than seventy years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the study, researchers analyzed 346 participants from the Framingham Heart Study cohort who were in their thirties when they originally entered the study (1995-1998). A standard young man. Study participants completed two nocturnal sleep studies measuring polysomnography (PSG) between 1995-1998 and 2001-2003, with an average interval of 5 years between studies. The researchers recorded the participants&#39; Alzheimer&#39;s disease status over the next 17 years and analyzed the relationship between deep sleep and Alzheimer&#39;s disease risk. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Study participants&#39; average percentage of deep sleep at baseline was 18.1%, and participants&#39; deep sleep time decreased between the two nightly sleep studies, suggesting that deep sleep increases with age. reduce. During the 17 years of follow-up, 52 patients with Alzheimer&#39;s disease were diagnosed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After adjusting for other influencing factors, the researchers found that each 1% decrease in deep sleep per year was associated with a 27% increase in the risk of all-cause Alzheimer&#39;s disease and a 32% increase in the risk of Alzheimer&#39;s disease. % related. The study also found that in the presence of a genetic risk for Alzheimer&#39;s disease (APOE4 allele), the decrease in deep sleep accelerates with age, but changes in brain volume do not affect deep sleep time. This means that Alzheimer&#39;s disease can be effectively prevented if people maintain a normal amount of deep sleep. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The reason is that deep sleep is essential for the brain to remove metabolic waste, including the main proteins that accumulate in Alzheimer&#39;s disease, such as amyloid beta (Aβ) and tau protein. At the same time, as we age, there will be less and less deep sleep, which may lead to a continued weakening of lymphoid fluid clearance, increase the risk of Aβ and Tau protein formation, and lead to neurodegenerative diseases or Alzheimer&#39;s disease . At the same time, insufficient deep sleep is also associated with the development of vascular risk factors and may lead to dementia through the accumulation of cerebrovascular disease. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although this study does not reveal the exact cause-and-effect relationship between insufficient deep sleep and Alzheimer&#39;s disease, maintaining deep sleep time is a simple way to prevent Alzheimer&#39;s disease, and it can be done at a young age. You should have and maintain good deep sleep when you are young, because the time of deep sleep is different for different ages. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Deep sleep is also called golden sleep. It is the stage when people sleep the deepest and most soundly. At this time, they cannot hear any noise outside and it is difficult to be awakened by others. During deep sleep, the human body has a powerful body repair function, and the effect of relieving fatigue is also most obvious. For young people aged 20-30, deep sleep accounts for 20%-25% of their sleep time every night, while for elderly people aged 70-80, deep sleep accounts for only 5%-7% of their total sleep time every night. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Deep sleep is related to the duration of sleep, which is another manifestation of quantity and quality. When an average person sleeps less than 6 hours a night, deep sleep will be reduced. Moreover, if you want to have better and more time of deep sleep, you must first fall asleep before 23:00. 23:00 to 3:00 the next morning is the best time to enter deep sleep. Once you miss it, no matter how long you sleep afterwards, you will It&#39;s hard to make up for it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, even a very short nap, 1-3 pm is the optimal rest time, which can enhance the brain&#39;s memory processing ability. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the information age, in order to reduce and prevent the early onset of Alzheimer&#39;s disease, it is best not to stay up late and maintain normal and better deep sleep. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;获取更多RSS：&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 09 Nov 2023 12:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[69个案例，多个政府部门被立案调查背后：反垄断的硬骨头]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260196]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-09 11:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;Starting in March 2022, the State Administration for Market Regulation will launch a nationwide campaign to curb administrative abuses Powers, special actions to eliminate law enforcement that restricts competition.

(Photo provided by People’s Vision)&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On April 7, 2023, the Urban Management Bureau of Dingnan County, Jiangxi Province was placed under investigation for reasons related to the operating rights of shared bicycles. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;At the end of 2022, the Dingnan County Urban Management Bureau will conduct a public bidding for the shared electric bicycle operating rights project in the main urban area of ​​the county. In the end, two companies obtained the operating rights, and the Urban Management Bureau signed contracts with these two companies, limiting a total of 1,500 vehicles to be put into operation for a period of three years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;After investigation by the Jiangxi Provincial Market Supervision and Administration Bureau, it is believed that the Dingnan County Urban Management Bureau limited the number of shared electric vehicles in the main urban area through public bidding without any legal and regulatory basis. Operating enterprises excludes or restricts other business entities with qualified qualifications and service capabilities from entering this market, hindering fair market competition. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Dingnan County Urban Management Bureau was found to have abused administrative power to exclude and restrict competition. This behavior is also called administrative monopoly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Chen Bing, director of the Competition Law Research Center of Nankai University, explained that administrative monopoly is an administrative monopoly that directly or indirectly interferes with market competition to protect or support certain entities by abusing administrative power. specific operators or commodities to maximize the interests of themselves or others. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;2023 is the 15th anniversary of the implementation of the Anti-Monopoly Law. The &quot;Regulations on Preventing the Abuse of Administrative Power to Eliminate or Restrict Competition&quot; have also been revised. Starting from April 15, 2023 Effective from today. Since March 2022, the State Administration for Market Regulation has launched a nationwide special campaign to stop the abuse of administrative power and exclude and restrict competition from law enforcement. From June 2022 to January 2023, a total of 5 batches and 63 administrative monopoly cases were announced. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In 2023, the State Administration for Market Regulation will launch a special anti-monopoly law enforcement action in the field of people&#39;s livelihood. The two batches of typical cases currently announced include 6 administrative monopoly cases. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In September 2023, the behavior of the Dingnan County Urban Management Bureau was reported as a typical case of anti-administrative monopoly. At present, the Dingnan County Urban Management Bureau has made rectifications, canceled the contract, and issued an announcement to fully open the shared electric vehicle market in the main urban area of ​​the county. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;With &quot;good intentions&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;October 2023 On the 18th, relevant staff from the Dingnan County Urban Management Bureau told Southern Weekend reporters that they had canceled the bidding. The Harbin Urban Management Bureau, which was put under investigation for the same reason, stated that the shared bicycle bidding business has been handed over to the Municipal Transportation Management Bureau. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Southern Weekend reporters found that in 69 cases, a total of 69 administrative agencies were punished. Generally speaking, the cases involved are mainly concentrated in the fields of people&#39;s livelihood such as urban management, medical care, education, and construction. Chen Bing explained that industry supervision in these fields has obvious characteristics, and administrative agencies can directly allocate resources during the management process. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Judging from the typical cases published, the motivations of the units involved are different, and some administrative monopoly behaviors even occur out of &quot;good intentions.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In March 2022, the Housing and Urban-Rural Development Bureau of Xiangshan County, Ningbo City issued a recommended list of housing safety appraisal institutions, requiring those who carry out housing safety appraisal business in Xiangshan County to obtain the municipal certification After filing the certificate with the Housing and Urban-Rural Development Bureau, you should register with the County Housing and Urban-Rural Development Bureau. In October 2022, the Zhejiang Provincial Market Supervision Bureau determined that this behavior constituted the abuse of administrative power to exclude and restrict competition. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;A staff member of the Xiangshan County Housing and Urban-Rural Development Bureau told Southern Weekend reporters that their original intention was to facilitate the masses, “They always ask questions like this when they come to do business. ——We don’t know which housing safety agencies to look for for appraisal, so we put the list of nearly 20 registered agencies on the official account of the County Housing and Urban-Rural Development Bureau.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The above-mentioned staff emphasized that house safety appraisal is a bottom-line issue. They need to comprehensively analyze the qualifications, capabilities, and creditworthiness of all appraisal agencies before making it public. Therefore, they A directory of housing safety appraisal agencies registered in Ningbo City will be formed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;After the investigation, the Xiangshan County Housing and Urban-Rural Development Bureau has withdrawn the recommended list. However, this staff member believes that if there are only one or two houses, it may be a monopoly. However, their recommended list includes more than a dozen housing safety appraisal agencies from Ningbo and Hangzhou, and &quot;there is none in Xiangshan.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In fact, some administrative agencies are not aware that the documents issued constitute an administrative monopoly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In August 2017, the Finance Bureau of Pingluo County, Ningxia designated an insurance company as the underwriting unit for traffic accident insurance for various administrative institutions in the county. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The person in charge of the relevant departments of the Pingluo County Finance Bureau said that because the document was released for so long, the drafter of the document and the person responsible for its preparation and issuance are no longer in the bureau. They had not noticed this document before. It was not until March 2023, when the Market Supervision Bureau came to investigate, that they found the document and invalidated the relevant provisions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;When it comes to the implementation of the document, the person in charge said that it also depends on the budget of each unit. Some units are implementing it, while others have not. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Sun Jin, director of the Competition Law and Policy Research Center of Wuhan University, believes that administrative agencies lack the concept of fair competition in the policy formulation process and often only think about bidding and investment. Introducing investment to stimulate the economy while ignoring the need to maintain the bottom line of fair competition in the market can easily lead to the emergence of administrative monopolies. &lt;strong>; &amp; nbsp; &amp; nbsp; &amp; nbsp; &amp; nbsp; &amp; nbsp; &amp; nbsp; &amp; nbsp; &amp; nbsp; &amp; nbsp; &amp; nbsp; &amp; nbsp; &amp; nbsp; sp; &amp; nbsp; &amp; nbsp; &amp; nbsp; &amp; nbsp; &amp; nbsp; &amp; nbsp; &amp; nbsp; &amp; nbsp ;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Antitrust and Anti-Corruption&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; >;Among the reported administrative monopoly cases, the common handling methods are to abrogate the execution of the original documents, terminate the bidding work or cancel the contract, and submit a rectification report. There are also cases where the market supervision and administration administration issues administrative proposals to the local people&#39;s government, and a few supervisors Personnel and those directly responsible were punished, often involving corruption such as power-for-money transactions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In April 2021, the Chenzhou City Education Bureau of Hunan Province identified 4 school uniform production and supply manufacturers through bidding, and divided the urban area into 4 areas, limiting each area. Regional schools can only purchase uniforms from designated manufacturers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The Hunan Provincial Market Supervision Bureau believed during its investigation in August 2021 that the above-mentioned behavior deprived the school and the parent committee of the right to make independent choices. As a result, the bidding process was terminated in September 2021. (The special action in 2022 announced 5 batches of 63 typical cases, 23 of which were filed for investigation in 2021.)&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;October 18, 2023, A staff member of the Chenzhou City Education Bureau office said that the technical equipment department, a secondary organization under the Education Bureau, is responsible for the primary and secondary school uniform business. Due to disciplinary violations in the public bidding process for the qualification of primary and secondary school uniform manufacturers, this organization was suspended midway. The Administration for Market Regulation called a halt, and the Commission for Discipline Inspection subsequently intervened in the investigation, and the person in charge of the agency was also punished. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The Chenzhou Municipal Commission for Discipline Inspection pointed out that from 2013 to 2022, Li Junhong took advantage of his position as deputy director and director of the Technical Equipment Department of the Chenzhou Municipal Education Bureau to facilitate others. Undertaken primary and secondary schools uniform business, school laboratories, facilities and equipment and installation service procurement projects to provide assistance, illegally receiving other people&#39;s property totaling 2.448 million yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In June 2022, Li Junhong was expelled from the party and dismissed from public office. Suspected criminal issues were transferred to the procuratorate for review and prosecution in accordance with the law. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;After being punished, the Chenzhou Municipal Education Bureau took rectification measures. The above-mentioned staff stated that the Education Bureau, together with the Municipal Development and Reform Commission and the Municipal Supervision Bureau, issued a notice on further standardizing the management of primary and secondary school uniforms on September 15, 2021, emphasizing that all documents and materials for the selection and purchase of school uniforms should be archived by the school. School uniforms Procurement contracts must be filed with the competent education department, and transactions shall not be interfered with by violating market principles or by fixing trademarks or other methods. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In addition, a monopoly case involving the Health Bureau of Shuangfeng County, Hunan Province is also worthy of attention. At the end of October 2021, relevant companies in the county jointly reported that the Shuangfeng County Health Bureau signed an agreement with a company to issue mandatory target tasks for drug procurement by county-affiliated public medical institutions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;An investigation by the Hunan Market Supervision Bureau found that Shuangfeng County Health Bureau signed a cooperation agreement with Sinopharm Holding Changsha Co., Ltd., requiring all public medical institutions in Shuangfeng County to A certain proportion of the purchase volume of medicines, consumables, equipment, etc. is provided to Sinopharm Holding Changsha Co., Ltd., and the Shuangfeng County Health Bureau also issues quotas in the form of documents to public medical institutions in the county. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The agreement also stipulates that from July 2021 to the end of 2022, the total purchase quota from public medical institutions in Shuangfeng County to Sinopharm Holding Changsha Co., Ltd. is 1.2 billion. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On October 19, 2023, a reporter from Southern Weekend contacted the person in charge of the Essential Drugs Unit of Shuangfeng County Health Bureau who is responsible for drug procurement and asked about the whole story. The other party said, &quot;I don&#39;t know and I don&#39;t want to talk about it.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In Sun Jin’s view, antitrust is often closely related to anti-corruption. Some companies rack their brains to maintain relationships with officials with decision-making power, waiting for the time to mature. , they will require the other party to formulate rules to protect their interests, such as granting exclusive business rights, or giving opportunities in policy preferences, incentives and subsidies, and bidding. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;This also means that some market entities will also push administrative agencies to abuse administrative power.&quot; Sun Jin added. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;The harm of administrative monopoly&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Compared to the economy Sexual monopoly and administrative monopoly rarely come into public view. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Chen Bing believes that on the one hand, there are indeed fewer cases of administrative monopoly than economic monopoly cases; on the other hand, administrative monopoly is mainly ordered to correct and punished by superior authorities. The focus is on punishing supervisors or other responsible personnel in accordance with the law, and the punishment information does not belong to the content that must be disclosed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;But administrative monopoly is more harmful than economic monopoly.&quot; Chen Bing explained that administrative monopoly sets unreasonable entry barriers, causing market Fragmentation and misallocation of resources prevent other operators from making full use of their own advantages to participate in competition. In the long run, this will reduce the competitiveness and innovation capabilities of all enterprises in the market, and at the same time reduce the total social welfare. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Sun Jin believes that for anti-monopoly law enforcement agencies, anti-economic monopoly is mainly a technical issue, and it is not difficult to judge whether it has substantially hindered fair market competition. Not big. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;He emphasized that the hard nut of anti-monopoly is actually administrative monopoly. At present, abuse of power still occurs from time to time, and it is still very serious in some areas. In addition, in administrative monopolies, there is a large amount of interest transfer, and some companies gain unfair competitive advantages, suppress small and medium-sized enterprises, and compete for their profit opportunities. This is contrary to common prosperity, high-quality development, and the construction of a unified national market. Anti-administrative monopoly has always been the top priority of anti-monopoly work. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;It is worth noting that on August 1, 2022, the first day the new Anti-Monopoly Law came into effect, Gan Lin, Director of the State Anti-Monopoly Bureau, published an article in the &quot;People&#39;s Daily&quot; The signed article mentioned that &quot;we must insist on equal emphasis on preventing market monopoly and breaking administrative monopoly.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;At the 2023 National Market Supervision System Anti-Monopoly Work Conference, anti-administrative monopoly is also the focus of the 2023 work goals, including strengthening the supply of fair competition review systems , studying and drafting the &quot;Fair Competition Review Regulations (Draft)&quot;, etc. At present, the &quot;Fair Competition Review Regulations&quot; have been publicly solicited for opinions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In the 15 years since the Anti-Monopoly Law was implemented, the fair competition review mechanism has been an important part of the anti-administrative monopoly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In 2016, the State Council issued the &quot;Opinions on Establishing a Fair Competition Review System in the Construction of the Market System&quot;, emphasizing standardizing government behavior and establishing a fair competition review system. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;A landmark node is that the State Administration for Market Regulation was officially listed in April 2018 and began to assume unified anti-monopoly law enforcement responsibilities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In June 2022, the Anti-Monopoly Law was revised for the first time after its promulgation. The chapter involving anti-administrative monopoly added a fair competition review system. &quot;This is equivalent to controlling the situation from the source and reducing the impact of policies formulated by administrative agencies on market competition,&quot; Chen Bing analyzed. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Breaking down regional barriers&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Relevant regulations and policies are constantly evolving While improving, anti-administrative monopoly law enforcement has also been continuously strengthened. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The special anti-administrative monopoly action in 2022 is not the first time. From September 2019 to January 2020, the State Administration for Market Regulation carried out special actions nationwide to stop the abuse of administrative power and exclude and restrict competition from law enforcement, focusing on transportation, construction, medicine, official seal engraving, bidding and government procurement5 an area where there are many illegal activities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;During the special operation, the market supervision department investigated more than 50 cases in the above five fields and verified more than 80 case clues. However, no typical cases were announced to the public at that time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In addition, the State Administration for Market Regulation has published an annual report on antitrust enforcement every year since its establishment. The report shows that from 2019 to 2022, law enforcement agencies investigated a total of 354 cases of abuse of administrative power to eliminate or restrict competition, and concluded 198 cases. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Among them, the numbers of such cases investigated from 2019 to 2021 were 84, 98, and 80 respectively, and the numbers settled were 12, 67, and 46 respectively. The State Administration for Market Regulation launched a special law enforcement action on the abuse of administrative power to exclude and restrict competition in 2022, investigating a total of 92 cases and settling 73 cases. The number of settlements increased by 59% compared with 2021. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In contrast, in the eleven years from 2008 to 2018, antitrust law enforcement agencies investigated and dealt with a total of 223 such cases, with an average of approximately 20 cases; and in the four years from 2019 to 2022, the average was 88 cases per year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The fair competition review system is also constantly being implemented and promoted. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In 2019, the fair competition review system achieved full coverage of the national, provincial, municipal, and county governments. As of the end of 2020, a total of 857,000 newly issued policies had been reviewed across the country, and more than 4,100 policy measures that violated review standards were discovered and corrected. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In 2022 alone, various regions and departments will review 163,700 newly issued policies and measures, clean up 452,000 existing policies and measures of various types, and abolish, revise, and correct There are more than 20,000 policies and measures to eliminate or restrict competition. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In other words, these policy documents that may affect fair competition in the market have not been issued because they have not passed the fair competition review, or previously issued documents have been abolished because they have not passed the review. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Overall, the anti-administrative monopoly work has a long way to go, and there are still some problems that need to be solved urgently. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Chen Bing pointed out that on the one hand, it is necessary to break down local protection and regional barriers, thoroughly clean up policies and practices that hinder market access and the free circulation of commodity factors, and reduce institutional Transaction costs are the key to breaking down barriers that restrict economic circulation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On the other hand, it is necessary to continuously regulate the interference of administrative power in market competition, &quot;especially in the fields of bidding, government procurement, public utilities and other fields, to prevent designated transactions , discriminatory conditions and other unfair behaviors, allowing local governments to effectively form an integrated competition protection mechanism of &#39;pre-examination + in-process and post-event supervision&#39;.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In Sun Jin’s view, consciousness and concepts are the core issues. He believes that antitrust laws need to be popularized among government officials so that they can make scientific, reasonable and legal decisions based on the provisions of antitrust laws and fair competition review systems. “Consumers and small and medium-sized enterprises also need to be mobilized to supervise the government, and all parties can work together to promote An ecology of fair competition.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 09 Nov 2023 11:25:03 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[跨国药企扎堆进博会，多款创新药首秀]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260172]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-09 10:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 09 Nov 2023 10:25:04 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
