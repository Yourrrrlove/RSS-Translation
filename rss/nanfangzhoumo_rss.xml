Hopelessly complicated mentality? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If you think about these two questions for a moment, you can understand the problem of the new film &quot;Rescuing Suspect&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/12/76d97e67a4f527fd1014fe0ec6ed7492.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;1512&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/12/76d97e67a4f527fd1014fe0ec6ed7492.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;258041&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This film is produced by Directed by Zhang Yimou&#39;s daughter Zhang Mo, it is a remake of the Korean movie &quot;Seven Days&quot;. The original work was not a good work, and the remake failed to make the story interesting. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The movie is about a gold medal lawyer played by Zhang Xiaofei. After her daughter is kidnapped, she receives a mysterious phone call asking her to defend a criminal suspect. If she wins, her daughter will live, and if she loses, she will be killed. In order to save her daughter, she had no choice but to get involved, check the suspect&#39;s information, explore the life of the deceased woman, and then the entire case came to light. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is no doubt that the choice of this subject was driven by female directors aiming at female stories. It’s a pity that we don’t see tenderness and empathy for female characters in the movie. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Originally, the intertwining of light and dark aspects of human nature and the gaps between love and hate in interpersonal relationships are where the tension lies in the story, but in this film, these are all ignored. The director likes to focus the camera on the emotional reactions of the characters, making them gasp, cry, anxious, have tears in their eyes, or have gloomy eyes. They like to use slow motion to show the somatic characteristics of people in pain. However, as for the undercurrents beneath these waves, But he didn&#39;t care. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/12/c8e979e942e077ea8429669a3b1036ae.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;487&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/12/c8e979e942e077ea8429669a3b1036ae.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;258040&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past few years There are a large number of female creators who constantly surprise us, such as Phoebe Waller-Bridge in &quot;Fleabag&quot; and Shao Yihui in &quot;The Myth of Love&quot;. They are all good at listening to the footsteps of their characters. Next, they bring their insight into the character&#39;s heart, their subtle description of desire, and their empathy for pain and separation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These perspectives are subtle and gentle, illuminating the hearts of the audience. Therefore, I am particularly looking forward to a female director remaking this story. Coupled with the constant positive reviews from the pre-release publicity, I expect her to be able to show the grief and indignation of a mother who is stunned, painful, resentful, regretful, and helpless, and finally goes to despair. This is a tragedy taking shape, and it also allows the audience to step on the edge of the protagonist&#39;s heart and resonate with her. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Unfortunately, the film did not record the footsteps of the tragedy. Without the sound of footsteps, the movie lacks the power to evoke emotions and thinking, just like a small cool drama mass-produced on a short video platform. However, it is also doubtful whether this film can really achieve the purpose of pleasing the audience like these low-cost, fast-produced dramas, because its pace is slow, and the twists are cliched and lack logic. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/12/fc2bc6cfbeff05c167b9868cf15b736e.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;492&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/12/fc2bc6cfbeff05c167b9868cf15b736e.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;258039&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;And this The narrative completion that only stays at the visual excitement and superficial twists is almost a kind of surrender by the director: I can&#39;t understand the characters, I can&#39;t figure out the story, this is the only way I can go. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I don’t know whether this is the director’s lack of confidence in his own expressive ability, or his habit of shooting movies as short videos: plots that do not ask for logic, emotions that are not patiently laid out, all the effort is spent on Play with various camera moves and reversals. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I have heard more than one person complain that movies in recent years, including Hollywood blockbusters, have become more and more short videos. There is a group of people who no longer want to film real stories, abandon the core &quot;people&quot; of the story, and choose to fill the audience&#39;s stomach with potato chips, popcorn and Coke. Therefore, popular hot words, amplified emotions, and reversal techniques are their operating formulas. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/12/8cc113799c717260831859c21a4d1fb7.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;489&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/12/8cc113799c717260831859c21a4d1fb7.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;258042&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This trend There are of course practical factors behind it. For example, viewers who are anxious about survival have reduced mental strength, no longer have the ability to empathize with others, and only desire quick emotional satisfaction. The creators followed suit, and film and television fast-moving consumer goods became very popular. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, responsible creators will still try to pull the tired audience out of the small world and tell them that Coca-Cola potato chips cannot provide real nutrition, and they will ultimately not be able to fill the empty hearts of adults. We need to go into the broader story and identify the emotional antidote that suits us. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Writing this, I originally wanted to avoid discussing the family background of the director of this film, but when I thought about it, it had close to 10% of the film schedule at the beginning of its release, the promotion of a five-star rating, and Hui Yinghong, Actors like Zhang Xiaofei can&#39;t help but think of the words of supermodel Victoria Ceretti against Depp&#39;s daughter:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Please don&#39;t compare yourself to me. I don&#39;t have a rich father. We Ordinary girls in this industry have to use their own efforts to gain everyone&#39;s respect. It doesn&#39;t mean that you can succeed by lying on the sofa of a mansion in Malibu.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Being born in Rome is a blessing, not a mistake. . But after enjoying resources that most outstanding creators cannot enjoy, only handing in such an answer sheet will inevitably make people feel complicated. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 12 Nov 2023 23:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[专家解答：得了支原体肺炎需要输液、“洗肺”吗？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260480]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-12 22:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Recently, mycoplasma pneumonia in children has attracted widespread attention. When is a child contagious? Do I need infusion or &quot;lung washing&quot;? Worried about whether the hospital can be self-administered due to the large number of people in the hospital? On the occasion of World Pneumonia Day on November 12, the reporter interviewed relevant medical experts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“After being infected with Mycoplasma pneumoniae, there is an incubation period of several days before the onset of fever, at which time the patient is contagious to a certain extent.” Zhou Wei, deputy chief physician of pediatrics at Peking University Third Hospital, said that wearing a mask can It can prevent infection to a certain extent, but it is not realistic for children to wear masks strictly and regularly. Going less often to crowded closed public places, ventilating the house frequently, regularly cleaning and disinfecting schools, and increasing outdoor activities are all helpful in preventing infection. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Is infusion the best treatment for mycoplasma pneumonia? Zhou Wei said that some parents believe that intravenous infusion is better than oral treatment, but in fact there is no such conclusion. Treatment should be selected based on the child&#39;s condition. Children with severe pneumonia can choose intravenous infusion, while most children with mild illness can be treated with oral medications. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for the &quot;lung washing&quot; operation that parents are worried about, Zhou Wei said, &quot;This year, more children with mycoplasma pneumonia are indeed undergoing lung lavage treatment. Lung lavage has strict operating indications, such as patients with If the child develops atelectasis, local consolidation, or even very serious inflammatory reactions such as necrosis and sputum plug formation, lung lavage may need to be performed under a bronchoscope to unblock the airway, and it can also be seen under the microscope. To the extent of lung disease.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to mycoplasma, bacteria and viruses can also cause pneumonia. Ye Huan, director of the Respiratory Department of Beijing Chest Hospital, reminded that pneumonia patients often have typical symptoms such as fever, cough, and difficulty breathing, and young children and the elderly should pay special attention to precautions. It is recommended that people over 65 years old and children get the pneumonia vaccine. Although there is currently no vaccine against Mycoplasma pneumoniae, the pneumonia vaccine can prevent a variety of pneumococci. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Experts remind that for pneumonia caused by different pathogens, the medication choices are also different. For example, for mycoplasma pneumonia, penicillin and cephalosporin antibiotics are ineffective, and macrolide antibiotics are the most commonly used. Patients who are suspected of being infected with pneumonia should seek medical treatment in a timely manner and receive targeted treatment after diagnosis, and avoid blind medication such as &quot;self-administration of antibiotics&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 12 Nov 2023 22:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[为何总有体育馆塌顶：暴雪之下掩藏多少行业沉疴]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260478]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-12 20:27:34&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;On November 7, 2023, Yuecheng Stadium after the roof collapsed.

Photo by Xinhua News Agency reporter Chen Yichen&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Within more than a hundred days, two stadium roof collapse accidents occurred in Qiqihar City and Jiamusi City, Heilongjiang Province, killing 11 and 3 people respectively, including 13 minors. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On July 23, 2023, the night of the Qiqihar accident, Heilongjiang quickly organized and carried out safety inspections of various schools and public welfare sports venues. The main leaders of Jiamusi Huanan County went to Yuecheng Gymnasium the next day Observe on the spot. 105 days later, on November 6, Jiamusi ushered in the first snow before winter. In the gymnasium where the leaders had implemented safety production requirements, tragedy happened again. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These are not the only two cases of large-span roof collapse. Southern Weekend reporters found that there have been many steel structure roof collapse accidents in recent years: In April 2022, the roof of a swimming pool collapsed in Zhengzhou, Henan, causing 3 deaths and 9 injuries; in November 2021, the light steel structure roof of a project in Jinhua, Zhejiang collapsed, causing 6 deaths and 6 injuries; in March 2021, a grid roof collapsed at a construction site in Qingdao, Shandong, causing 1 death and 7 injuries; in May 2019, the roof of a steel structure building collapsed in Baise, Guangxi, causing 6 deaths and 87 injuries. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is not unique to China. Wang Luchuan (pseudonym), an expert in engineering accident research and former chief engineer of Beijing Urban Construction Group, told Southern Weekend reporters that roof collapse accidents of large-span structures are a common problem in buildings around the world. According to the cases he knows, stadium collapses have occurred in France, the United States, and Canada. ACCIDENT. “Currently there are relatively few cases of stadium collapse in China.” Wang Luchuan emphasized. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many stadium roof collapse accidents point to the design form of fragile long-span steel structures. How did it change from a popular architectural style to the &quot;Sword of Damocles&quot; hanging above people&#39;s heads? &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Reduce costs, reduce loads&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;On November 6, 2023, netizens focused their attention on the roof of the Jiamusi stadium that collapsed just five years after it was built. According to Xinhua News Agency, The roof structure of the stadium is an H-shaped variable-section steel beam structure. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu Yonggang, chief engineer of Chengdu Southeast Steel Structure Co., Ltd., has 19 years of relevant experience. He told Southern Weekend reporters that this structure is called a portal steel frame structure in the industry, that is, doors made of H-shaped steel The structure can form a span of 20 to 30 meters, so there is no need to set up many columns. It is usually used in the design of small gymnasiums and factory buildings. &quot;The gymnasium in Jiamusi covers an area of ​​675 square meters, and the portal structure still matches the overall structure.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“This structure itself has no problems, it is simple and simple, and it is a relatively mature structural system.” Liu Yonggang explained that the steel structure has good toughness and high strength, and it can be built like building blocks. It can be built quickly and achieve good architectural effects. &quot;It is excellent in itself, but if it is not used properly, problems will occur.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu Yonggang introduced that the first step to make good use of steel structures is design, and the first step in design is selection. There are many structural forms that can meet the long-span function, such as portal structure, grid structure, truss structure, etc. Among them, the portal steel frame structure uses the least amount of steel, and its processing and installation technology is relatively simple, so it is also one of these three structures. The cheapest among the structures. The stadium that collapsed in Jiamusi this time was a portal structure. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the type is selected, the next step is to calculate the load. Different load values ​​determine the amount of steel used and the compressive resistance of the building. In the Northeast region, in addition to the conventional wind loads, live loads, seismic loads, dust loads, etc. that need to be considered, the building design codes have additional provisions for the frequent heavy snow weather, that is, increasing the snow load. At the same time, in order to make it easier for snow to slide down, the roof slope is usually designed to be larger, but the increase in slope also means an increase in the cost. Photos of the interior of the Jiamusi Yuecheng Gymnasium circulated online show that the roof supported by H-shaped steel beams has a smaller slope, which means that the roof is easier to accumulate snow. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Whether a building is designed safely is related to the designer’s personal expertise and experience, as well as the owner’s budget and requirements. Liu Yonggang introduced that designers from large design institutes will be more professionally persistent. For example, if they want to design a satisfactory and strong building, they will superimpose and evaluate all unfavorable factors, and then the designed plan will be relatively conservative, and the amount of steel used will naturally be higher. Increase. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For some owners who pursue maximizing profits and repaying their capital as soon as possible, &quot;obedient&quot; small design institutes are their first choice. &quot;Some owners are looking for costs. They will say, save me a little more, reduce the amount of steel used, and laymen will guide experts. Some small design institutes also want to survive, so they will try to figure out the load and meet the specifications. The limit.&quot; Liu Yonggang said. Yuecheng Gymnasium was designed by Jiamusi Architectural Design Institute. Liu Yonggang said that this design institute is a relatively small design institute. “It’s just that the design institute is small and it is not clear whether the design experience is sufficient.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;The redundancy of this kind of stadium building design is too low. If you pile something on it, it will collapse. If you spend 100 yuan to keep it from collapsing, then you are willing to spend 101 Yuan, or are you willing to spend 200 Yuan?&quot; Wang Luchuan said frankly that he could understand, &quot;It is unlikely that the redundancy of such a long-span roof will be particularly high, so the cost will be too high. Like a bridge, an additional 10 % redundancy may increase the cost by 50%. But it cannot be given too low. It is really unjustifiable if it collapses in 5 years.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;On November 7, 2023, the person in charge of Yuecheng Sports Club and others have been controlled by the police.

Photo by Xinhua News Agency reporter Chen Yichen&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“People don’t know goods, money knows goods”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In fact, even having a perfect design plan does not guarantee the safety of the building. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Feng Ruoqiang, a professor at the School of Civil Engineering of Southeast University, wondered why a gymnasium that had just been built five years ago collapsed. &quot;The first five years are the best period for the house. It is impossible not to consider the snow load when designing. But if it collapses at this time, the problem is still quite big.&quot; He told Southern Weekend reporters that if there are no problems with the design drawings, then Is the construction quality strictly controlled: &quot;For example, does the purchased steel meet the strength requirements, is the construction section strictly in accordance with the drawing requirements, and is the weld quality qualified?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From the industry situation, in the steel components Quality risks may also exist in the processing and manufacturing process. Liu Yonggang introduced that some small processing plants only have two or three machines and can invest hundreds of thousands of yuan to process, but they often do not have standardized management structures, quality management systems and safety production systems to control product quality. &quot;For example, after the factory buys the steel plate from the steel factory, it cuts it into pieces with a flame, and then welds it to form each steel component. During processing, if the hole is punched out of place, it needs to be cut larger with a flame. This will damage the steel and shorten its original service life.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Regular enterprises have a complete management system. Liu Yonggang took his own company as an example, &quot;When we buy steel plates, we need to detect and inspect them. After they are processed into steel components, we have to inspect them ourselves and ask a third party to inspect them before they can leave the factory.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On-site installation also requires attention to quality control. During the installation process, if the operation is not standardized, it will also cause quality defects and the designed service life will not be reached. &quot;Installation is equivalent to the final assembly of a car, which means bringing the processed steel components to the site for installation. It is best to have professionals do professional work.&quot; Liu Yonggang said that some irregular construction units bring a group of migrant workers to work, &quot; I was still farming yesterday, and tomorrow I will install the steel structure. If the accuracy of one place is not adjusted well, I will start the next step of installation, and it will be cut again and again, and errors will accumulate.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Optimization&quot; is also a common problem during the construction process. Feng Ruoqiang said that in order to make more money, a construction unit that won the bid &quot;optimized&quot; the design height of the steel beam from 600 mm to 400 mm and the wall thickness of the steel beam from 20 mm to 12 mm during construction. In order to save labor in the welding process, low-level welders are used to replace good welders with high wages. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu Yonggang believes that winning bids at low prices is the direct cause of the &quot;optimization&quot; trend in the industry. He found that the bidding prices of large companies are about 20% higher than that of small companies, mainly reflected in management costs, raw material costs and installation costs. “Our industry association also makes suggestions to the general contractor and the government, hoping that the price will not be lowered again and again. If the price is too low, if a small company does it, there will be problems such as &#39;optimization&#39;, cutting corners, etc., and ultimately it will be &#39;profitable&#39;.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, it is difficult to change. &quot;The difficulty now is still money. In order to put into production as soon as possible, the owner requires you to rush for work hours and save costs. Including government investment, it is also reducing costs. As long as you don&#39;t choose the cheap one, you have made a mistake. People don&#39;t know the goods. , money knows the goods.&quot; Liu Yonggang sighed with emotion. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;Don&#39;t kill yourself&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Sports venues designed and constructed in accordance with national standards cannot &quot;sit back and relax.&quot; In the specific use stage, safety mainly depends on the owner&#39;s consciousness, and there are no national mandatory standards. &quot;If a sports venue cannot be used correctly, it is prone to problems. During use, do not use it indiscriminately. People cannot go on the roof but you have to go up. There are no other loads on the roof but some additional loads are added.&quot; Many interviewed experts told Southern Weekend reporters The collapse of Qiqihar No. 34 Middle School Gymnasium was caused by more human factors. Its roof structure was called a bolted ball grid structure. Due to the illegal stacking of water-absorbing perlite, the load was excessive and suddenly collapsed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Qiqihar Stadium is a typical example of improper use.” Feng Ruoqiang believes that during the blizzard weather when the Yuecheng Stadium collapsed, “As an operator, you either close the stadium or pay extra attention. During the use phase Operators must have sufficient safety awareness, which is very important.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among building materials such as concrete, steel structures, and aluminum alloys, steel structures have a fatal weakness, which is its corrosion problem. It is more susceptible to oxidation. After oxidation, the performance of the material will be greatly reduced. Many collapse accidents are caused by corrosion of steel structures. Therefore, the maintenance of steel structure houses is very important. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“The steel structures we build need to be repainted every 10 to 15 years, and the bolts must be checked to see if they have fallen off. We will recommend that owners perform annual maintenance, or conduct major inspections every few years, and deal with problems as soon as possible if they are found. Liu Yonggang said, but now many steel structure buildings are difficult to maintain after they are repaired. &quot;Either it is covered by the suspended ceiling or wrapped in the wall, making it impossible to repair some places. If a rod is bent, it is difficult to notice. Some rods are force-bearing rods. If they are suddenly broken, the force will be distributed If the other members cannot bear it, they will suddenly collapse.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Feng Ruoqiang visited many gymnasiums in a city in East China. Out of professional habit, he noticed that the steel structure roofs of some swimming pools were corroded. It&#39;s amazing, the paint is peeling off, but no one pays attention to this problem. Some poorly maintained badminton courts install heavy chandeliers and suspended ceilings on the roof for the convenience of playing, which will make the venue unsafe. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As an ordinary person, how can we judge whether the steel structure gymnasium we are in is safe? Liu Yonggang introduced the key points of observation: &quot;We mainly look at a few places, first to see how it transmits force. For example, the roof receives the load, and the roof transmits the force to the beams, the beams to the columns, and the columns to the supports and embedded parts. Etc. Therefore, we look at it from the other side, whether the column bolts have fallen off, whether the column has deformed, whether the column elevation has settled, and looking further up, whether the supports between beams have fallen off, whether the beams have deformed, whether the purlins have Is there any bend?” However, when these problems can be seen with the naked eye, it means there is an imminent safety risk. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the collapse of the Qiqihar Stadium, Heilongjiang requested a comprehensive investigation of public welfare sports venues in the province; after the Jiamusi accident, the local government once again conducted a thorough investigation of long-span spatial structures including gymnasiums, requiring &quot;no discounts, Leave no blind spots and don’t go through the motions.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Feng Ruoqiang believes that regular inspections by government departments are still necessary, but a solid inspection team must be formed. He suggested that the government could invite professionals in architecture and structure to &quot;focus on the inspection targets. First, check the stadiums with longer service life. If rust is found, apply anti-corrosion and anti-rust paint. Secondly, check the stadiums with lower design standards.&quot; Small and medium-sized gymnasiums”. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Our construction in the past 20 to 30 years has been a bit too fast. Many times everyone is rushing for work. After the accident, we were also discussing that many steel structures have been repaired for more than 30 years. , especially some venues built in the early stage, should be maintained or demolished.&quot; Liu Yonggang said, &quot;The dividend period of our industry has also passed.

To put it bluntly, it relies on the occurrence of a series of unexpected events to disintegrate the serious proposition of revenge. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among all film and television genres, comedy is the most deconstructive genre. It liberates us from a certain serious state and also liberates the protagonist from the weight of meaning. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Just like Koichi Numakura in &quot;The Legend of the Underworld&quot;, he is full of revenge plans, but what he actually does is to save the life of the underworld leader. Before Koichi Numakura even realizes how ridiculous his behavior is, we as the audience have already realized the ridiculousness of him betting his life on revenge. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/11/7ad631b60f27814fcb3c4adb8aa08e54.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;721&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/11/7ad631b60f27814fcb3c4adb8aa08e54.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;257964&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Comedy is not here To construct meaning and to paint it, we need to dig out the walls of meaning and make it appear somewhat powerless when it collapses. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This dissolution of meaning is comprehensive, and the objects it wants to mock include even us as the audience. It just sets a safe distance for us, allowing us to get a kind of psychological comfort from ridiculing the protagonist. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After seeing that Numakura Koichi started to practice &quot;Fist of the North Star&quot; diligently at the age of ten, and ten years later, he performed acupuncture on the underworld leader under a streetlight, and was beaten until his face was covered with blood. , the pain of being scolded as crazy also coincides with our feelings of working hard but not getting anything in return. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/11/d660e6b365ee5cd4d9b0329432df8966.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;608&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/11/d660e6b365ee5cd4d9b0329432df8966.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;257966&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Comedy, use A sudden escape method brings the audience into some common experience or experience, and thus resonates with it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;The Storm in the Cave Realm&quot; obviously understands this well, so most of its plot settings are deduced on this basis. For example, the acquaintance between the heroine Rika Sakamoto (played by Nishino Nanase) and Koichi Numakura is full of a sense of escape. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sakamoto Rika was originally a young woman who was interested in a massage career. However, due to her father&#39;s high paraplegia in a car accident, she had to work several jobs to support her family. She works in a custom shop at night, and Numakura Koichi met her when he went to the custom shop. She showed her massage skills to Numakura Koichi, but Numakura Koichi had a very bad experience. In turn, he gave Sakamoto Rika a massage, hoping to show her what a real master is. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/11/d905a0f491c7c617ebb8567812affaeb.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;608&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/11/d905a0f491c7c617ebb8567812affaeb.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;257965&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The result is, Sakamoto Rika kowtowed and became a disciple on the spot. But at this moment the alarm clock rang. Sakamoto Rika held the alarm clock seriously and asked the newly appointed teacher Numakura Koichi if he wanted to add another clock. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/11/ca53ed503071fc99c7904e30254fca19.gif&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height= &quot;357&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/11/ca53ed503071fc99c7904e30254fca19.gif&quot; data-key=&quot;257968&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Acupoint World&quot; The brilliance of &quot;Wind and Cloud&quot; as a comedy lies in this. It removes the fig leaf and allows you to discover the absurdity behind serious things and the emptiness behind persistence. And all the hard work and dedication sometimes seem like a ridiculous daydream. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This ubiquitous comedy makes Numakura Koichi&#39;s determination for revenge turn into a joke in the face of his actual actions to save the underworld leader again and again. The more serious Numakura Koichi looks and the more he swears, the more he looks like a clown. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/11/180acc554311c286ce8487972fb043ed.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;608&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/11/180acc554311c286ce8487972fb043ed.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;257967&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is a drama It is a collection of ridicule on the great contrast between Numakura Koichi&#39;s spirit and behavior. It is also a sigh about being too persistent and getting into trouble. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is why, when he thought of the underworld leader lying dying in bed due to a car accident, Numakura Koichi suddenly felt that he had lost the motivation to live. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He gambled his youth and life, letting hatred and anger fill his mind, but what he got in exchange was that he saved his enemies again and again. This joke that fate and character played on him was a bit too absurd. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 12 Nov 2023 20:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[费滢：巴黎黑户、旧货商人与10年博士生]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260360]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-12 19:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 11/08/lYKOEf6757VvmHrJPllfLZTZ2olhGCkPT9umLjv8.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/lYKOEf6757VvmHrJPllfLZTZ2olhGC kPT9umLjv8. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;257451&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern People Weekly reporter Liang Chen/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Literature Defended&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;On October 24, 2023, the 6th Blancpain Utopia Literature Award Ceremony was held in Beijing. Fei Yinghe The other four nominees sat in the audience. She was shortlisted for her novel collection &quot;The Legend of Dzi Beads&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among the finalists, her identity is relatively complicated.她出过三本书，第一本是中学时期写的《经常走神的女孩》，第二本是隔了近20年、于2020年出版的《东课楼经变》，第三本是2023年出版的中篇集《天珠传奇》。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;如果搜索她的名字，还能看到她十多年前高考失利的信息。她曾获得“全球华人少年美文写作征文大赛”金奖，文章被收入高中语文教材。但她带着大家对其高考作文25分的种种猜测离开她成长的南京，赴法国求学，一路读到博士，同时经营自己的古玩小生意（&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;法国签证上“职业”写的是“旧货商人”&lt;/span>;）。她在各地展会游走，身上常备放大镜（&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;经常丢&lt;/span>;）、紫光灯和现金（&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;摆摊时放旁边可以招财——一种古玩圈的玄学&lt;/span>;）三件套。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;她的博士专业是“佛教文献学”，读了10年还没毕业，被导师称作“失踪人口”。由于行政手续中的种种阴差阳错，被迫成为黑户近四年。其间，她混迹于巴黎十三区中国城，读书、捡漏……本着一鱼多吃的原则，或曰“争取最大的劳动报偿”——就像她的《东课楼经变》，得奖拿一次奖金，期刊转载拿一次稿费，再分别用繁体中文、简体中文出版一次——她将所见所闻都（顺便）写了小说，主要体现在第三篇《天珠传奇》。第一篇《行则涣》发生在她的家乡里下河流域，内容倒也大差不差，永远是账户里没什么钱的小古玩商到处晃膀子。中间那篇叫《反景》，集合了戏曲、灵异、悬疑和科幻——一种很赛博的混搭。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/7iuJKfhv5ryqGZAEj3FSP0Iuq48pMiJ8v0yN5hoT.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;673&quot; height=&quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/7iuJKfhv5ryqGZAEj3FSP0Iuq48pMiJ8v0yN5hoT.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;257456&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;人生经历丰富，写书倒成了其中不太起眼的一部分，尽管这部分让她获得更广泛的声名。她的小说《鸟》获得联合报文学奖短篇小说大奖，《东课楼经变》获得台湾台积电文学奖首奖。她甚至没有花太多时间写作，《鸟》只写了一两个小时，《天珠传奇》里的三个中篇也全部在半年内完成。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;作家唐诺说：“我见过非常多优秀的小说家，也见过一些天才的小说家，费滢是我看过最好的那几个之一，在我所碰到的人里应该不会超过三个……她的作品相对少，这是她的麻烦，我不确定小说界能不能得到这个人，她也许会有她觉得更有意思更有兴趣的事情去做。”正如在理想国文学奖颁奖典礼现场，没有人比她更关注赞助商的商品和发言。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;作为旧货商人，宝珀的手表有可能成为她的单品。她曾略微研究过古董表，知道石英表和电子表给机械表带来的两次冲击。听发言时脑里闪现过法国女人总爱买一块小小的lip表搭配时装、意大利的vetta价格飙升的过程，以及le jour是瑞士品牌的法国贴标等散碎记忆。古玩商术业有专攻，她偶尔学习的钟表知识只是拿来作客户谈资，“以显得有点格调”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;台上，赞助商的发言人针对“保卫复杂”给出了自己的定义：简单明快的表面，但机芯很复杂；而八百个零件的腕表，操作上又很简单。费滢突然明白了其中的用意：“或许机械表和文学做的事情某种程度是一致的，都是让时间显形的努力。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;她回忆起一些拍卖或者私人的交流会，悬浮、夸饰，商业味浓厚，但有种特别的体贴，那是资本主义发展到成熟阶段的产物，让人感受到一种公约的一点真诚。像毛姆《刀锋》里的艾略特，热衷于举办party，连安排座位也津津有味，在尖刻的同时也真诚且包容地托住了所有人的话头（&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;甚至是粗鄙的美国趣味&lt;/span>;）。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“这个感觉复杂到，甚至我会觉得我们这些所谓搞文学的人所自带的（&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;或有意显示的&lt;/span>;）一种清高的无知和无知的清高也被轻轻托举起来了。不，是被保卫了。毕竟相较之下，我们才是不专业的那一群。”她在事后写道。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;费滢文如其人，一脸浑不吝，说话露出八颗牙，眼睛眯成一条缝。她笑声敞亮，衣服宽大松垮，两袖走路时晃晃悠悠。讲话时，她常摆弄绿色的鸭舌帽，上面有只鸭子正昂着头用翅膀比“耶”。她嘴里的古玩轶事、江湖传说、黑户秘闻一茬接一茬，条理清晰，如果不干这行大概还可以去说书。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;她说自己是“生意人格转为的社牛”。嘻嘻哈哈的样子仿佛世界上没有什么事能难倒她——哦，拍照除外。镜头前的费滢表情失去了刚刚的眉飞色舞，凝结的神采散落一地，活泛的面孔瞬间僵硬。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;出版方介绍说，《天珠传奇》特别是《中国城》一篇，仿佛是“中国人写的世界文学”，是否准确要交由读者来评说，反正费滢手舞足蹈的时候挺“世界”的——丧着玩世不恭，又认真对待看到的不公——以她写的书评类推，这样直白下定义或许有些冒犯，也显得不太高级。如果看过她的豆瓣，多少能感觉到她密密麻麻的吐槽广播里潜藏的文学观：呈现，陈述，结束。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;对了，直到现在，她博士还没毕业。由此可以期待这段主动或被动拉长的学术生涯延伸出更多的可能。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/sjPrjtBofroQcW5jkI4XrPNVwchuHiunjfInemM6.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;

&lt;p>;回到巴黎，2000欧迅速被一个月的房租（&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;700欧&lt;/span>;）、一年的地铁票（&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;700欧&lt;/span>;）、一学期的学费（&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;400欧&lt;/span>;）肢解，只剩了一百多欧。她苦于生计，恰巧看见王菲和郭德纲在新闻照片里戴着唐八棱，当时市面上卖一万元人民币一颗。她知道这个珠子的来处：这是一种在汉代到唐代之间产生的玛瑙珠，基本从中亚进口，全球范围都有，量大、长得像，特异性有限。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;她想到汪曾祺的《跑警报》：有人带金子，必有人会丢掉金子，有人丢金子，就会有人捡到金子，我是人，故我可以捡到金子。 “我是人，为什么不能捡到？”她在jstor（&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;学术网站&lt;/span>;）上下载相关资料，借阅书籍，研究古代珠子的流通。 “我用一种写博士论文提纲的心情，搜罗了所有关于这方面的研究材料。”费滢说，“加上原有的一些知识，较为容易辨别大致在什么年代、什么范围，研究更是为了看它最可能在哪儿的市场上被发现。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一个月后，她开始在更大的范围内搜集散落的唐八棱。她去了法国古董市场和一些交易会，eBay（&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;线上拍卖及购物网站&lt;/span>;）翻了一千页，终于找到一条16颗的唐八棱手串，售价100美元。正值感恩节期间，卖家无心理会，“就100美元，我又不是艺术家，不会用你们的iPhone帮你们拍什么清晰的照片。”她只好求着卖家在灯光下拍了一颗珠子的特写照片确认真伪，再花100美元运费让这串珠子漂洋过海到了手中，转手卖给国内的商家，一颗5000元人民币，8万到手。自此算是入了行，正式成为一名古玩商。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;她总结，自己的古玩小生意大多数时候在提供一种服务，帮客户找到想要的东西。对大部分收藏者来说，古玩是一种彰显生活品味的消费品，类型选择上基本都随大流，市面上流行什么就想找什么。这些年，除了各种年代的玉石，她还帮人找过30年以上的老白茶、上了年份的茅台酒。 “茅台也算是古玩吗？”“连冬虫夏草都算。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“这都是想不到的一些需求。要做的事情还有很多，还要帮他们安排菜、安排宴席。比如说有意思的局，我在这个局上展示什么样的东西，我帮你安排。”费滢说，“大体上某种享受的、精致的、艺术的、奢侈的东西都可以事先统筹。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“（古玩商人）是一个很怀旧的职业，当然有很多的坑和骗术，但是也有道义和江湖规矩。结账时的说辞必不可少。去跟他们交换知识、主导他们品味的时候，又有夸大与说服的部分。一个客户信赖你，他把所有这方面的投资集中交付给你，让你帮他找心仪的物品，你要保真，并且可以退货。但你是他们的朋友吗？你只是一个商人。他们有些场合也会邀请你一起出席，权当某种文化筹码。你收取费用，但你又是他们的老朋友。非常有意思。这是一种自古有之的、老派的社交关系。”费滢说。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;老派交往不仅需要辨认真假的专业能力，更要人情练达。费滢在国外接触到的顶级古玩商大多名校毕业，经过系统培训，掌握多种语言，常与上流社会打交道，眼力极好，待人接物既专业又妥帖。 “在国外，收藏是一个中产以上的文化品位的象征，有太多文化加载的价值。”国内的古玩行业尚未成熟，不太会形成阶层，假货占了市场的99%，卖老货的古玩商大多是铲地皮出身，“他们都很爱看书。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;国内买古玩的人阶层不定，来路不明，故而对古玩商的社交能力挑战极大。费滢的一位朋友促成了一笔百万级的生意，送货时，对方指着家里的藏品，问这些东西好不好。朋友诚实地说：“有一些是假的。”对方脸一下就黑了，从头到尾没提交易的事，客气地喝完茶，再客气地送走他。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;古玩交流会几乎天天有，体力好的古玩商人一年可以360天都在展会上。衣食住行一定能省则省，飞机、高铁都不坐，换长途汽车、绿皮火车等各种各样的老派交通工具，一路车马人都慢。到了也不一定会住酒店，“75元一晚的洗浴中心不香吗？起来还有早餐。”费滢在德国跑展会，几个人包一辆小面包车，第二天早上去同行的大卡车集装箱里喝咖啡。但也是这群人，转眼就在交易会上买入价格高昂的祖母绿。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在交易会上互相看上东西了就开始“打仗”，彼此不透露底价，相互叫价，“相互创造GDP”，费滢旁观过交易额最高的一次有150万。入夜后，只剩下同行，几人合点一份夜宵、买几瓶酒开始诉衷肠。酒意上头，还不忘正事：“白天那个东西我们再谈谈。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“古玩的世界充满尔虞我诈的经济行为，但也是这个圈子，会有非常纯真与直白的东西出来。”比如有这样的古玩商，他认为你是我的朋友，今天你又带了别的朋友来到我的摊子，那就统统一百块，“你来了我必须给你面子。”再比如，我认识你，我们在这个地方碰到了，你说最近不太好，那我必须给你“开张”（&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;买你一件东西&lt;/span>;）。 “这就是道义。你客气，我比你还客气。你讲究，我比你还讲究。”费滢说，“这种关系有一种慰藉，现在已经不是一个利他的社会了，但这个行业还能给别人让利，给别人留有余地，每个链条都能转起来。”&lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;费滢的古玩启蒙来自10岁时在街头偶遇的卖假货的河南人（&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;“没有说河南人不好的意思。”她补充&lt;/span>;）。她在南京逛地摊，被他们的假货吸引。他们请她吃零食，告诉她这些都是假货。她受邀去了他们的小作坊，有一搭没一搭学了不少造假的技术。 “因为造假的技术是真的，围绕着造假的所有知识，都是你鉴定真品的知识。”他们甚至教费滢做人，援引众多收货的故事，比如5000元的货，货主因为毒瘾犯了，2800元也肯卖。以此警示：黄赌毒不能沾，一沾就完蛋。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;她喜欢古玩的原因同样来自这段经历。 “古玩是一个人精神的累积，是在一个时代审美一种非常浓缩的体现。比如大家都说宋代的审美代表了中国审美的一个高峰，你看它一个瓷瓶，（只是）青白瓷那种线条，就能说这是中国审美的最高峰了？这本身就是让我觉得有超过意义的东西。古玩可以是100%真，但是判断在移动，还有各种意义上的演变，整体比较吸引我。它不像一个文本，文本根本不知道是真是假，完全是流动的意义，甚至是一个词的搭载意义都很不稳定。它太容易被很多人使用之后，又确定成另一个意思。但是物品已经是一个过去的东西了，它有它的真假，它是一种正确性，但在这之上，它有很多附加的意义，这个意义又是流变的，这中间有很多冲突和拉扯。我确实体会到一种很徒劳或者很无意义的东西，这些审美的流变作用在我的生活上，让我变成一个玩世不恭的人。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;玩世不恭是费滢的底色，让呈现在小说里、脱胎自生活中的所有焦虑似乎都伤不到她，符合她的人物画像大概是永远晃着膀子在大大小小的街头游荡。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/mehZunkXety5GUzBzrgzkmuuVrCMKFKDHyp7sNK7.jpg&quot;

&lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;费滢在永乐拍卖上手学习&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（受访者提供/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2016年11月，费滢按规定去更新下一年的居留。法国行政处理很慢，积压了太多申请，系统也常崩溃，无法线上预约。她只能在生活区的移民局排队，抢每天的50个号。经历了两三次失败后，她提前在雪夜的凌晨4点排队到天明，终于坐到了移民局的工作人员面前。工作人员将她排到半年后交材料。交完材料一个月，对方来信告知，她申请得太晚，资料在警察局的系统里卡住了，建议回国重新申请留学签证。她又排了一次队去申诉，被驳回。同时因为有过申诉，她的材料被系统锁住，无法再被受理。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;她就这么成了黑户。她找到一名专为阿尔及利亚人打官司的律师，对方告诉她，再黑两年，凑够10年在法时间，就可以走身份常规化的流程。律师收费1800欧元，费滢震惊于收费之良心，对方说：“因为我也不确定能不能帮你办。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;律师有两个建议：“第一，把现在的纸质护照撕了，申请个新的，反正警察局和出入境都没联网。第二，换一个警察局，这个警察局态度差业内知名，咱们换个地区吧。”于是她搬到离巴黎十三区中国城一站地铁的94省，开始了一场两年多没有居留证件的豪赌。接着有了《天珠传奇》的故事。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;成为黑户有许多事做不了，比如合法打工。很多人看到费滢无所事事都会替她焦虑，但她自己确实不着急。 “可能从小形成的一种个性，我觉得都很烂，或者反正都会这样，你要急什么呢？人生它就是这样的。三岁看老吧，你也不知道是怎么样变成这样的人的，但是我确实从来没有为自身的任何问题焦虑过。要说焦虑，那可能也只是会为社会的公平正义而焦虑。”她说，“就像我对古玩会有一种认真、诚实的态度，这件物品它到底应该是什么样的、它是什么时代的、它是真的还是假的……我会非常较真。我对这个世界上很多事情也是这样的态度，这个事情到底应该是什么样的，每个人是否得到他应得的，甚至一本书应该被怎样评价，甚至我当时可能会做出一种误判，但是在那个时候我是非常较真的，它该是什么样就是什么样。但是我对某件物质上存有的、我自己喜欢的东西又不是足够在意，因为我觉得喜欢的东西终究是流动的。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;世界好像越来越糟糕，确实很难让人感到轻松，或许这也是费滢在豆瓣发表了太多议论的原因之一。 “因为你不可能处理所有事，如果你想发表一些看法，你就要承担后果，我希望以后有足够的能力可以承担，现在不一定能的。有时候你的态度、声音也会被曲解，我看了太多事情，太多行动所造成的后果，都是这样发生的，哪怕出发点很好。甚至在历史里，有太多个人的声音，会为一些社会现象发声，但发声后整个事件的走向、造成的很大的后果，其实不是一个人可以承担的。就像你造出核弹一样。每个个体都要为自己的言行负责，就像我做古玩，我为我卖出去的每一件东西负责。”&lt;/p>;

&lt;h4>;真假指南针&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;首先，我们在历史书上见到的那个“一个磁勺放在盘子上，怎么转勺柄都指向南方”的“司南”，是构造出来的，从文献到实物都不存在这样的东西。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;认为“司南”是指南针的观点，其文献依据主要出自战国时代的《韩非子》和东汉王充的《论衡》，但这是对文献记录的误解或者说曲解。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;《韩非子•有度篇》称：“夫人臣之侵其主也，如地形焉，即渐以往，使人主失端，东西易面而不自知。故先王立司南以端朝夕。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;此处的“司南”并不是指南针，而是在朝堂上标示南北方向，明君王坐北朝南之意，用法器和仪式来巩固君尊臣卑的政治格局。在静止的情况下要找出哪里是南方是很容易的事，根据太阳东升西降的方向来辨别就行了，不需要多高的技术，也不需要指南针之类的仪器。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;《论衡•是应篇》称：“古者质朴，见草之动，则言能指，能指则言指佞人。司南之杓，投之於地，其柢指南。鱼肉之虫，集地北行，夫虫之性然也。今草能指，亦天性也。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;王充写这篇的目的是反对两汉经学中天人感应的观念，认为自然事物的特点是其自性，跟人事无关，举的两个例子就是“司南之杓”和“鱼肉之虫”。 “杓”是北斗七星，不是勺子，“司南之杓，投之於地，其柢指南”这句话的意思，是说具有指南特性的北斗七星（像勺子形状）投射到地上，勺柄所指的方向就是南方，但这只是北斗七星自身的特性，跟人事无关。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;可见，无论是《韩非子》还是《论衡》，提到的“司南”都跟指南针毫无关系。那么，由于对文献的曲解而构造出来的盘子上放勺子的“司南”，为什么又确实能指南呢？因为这玩意儿是用现代技术人工磁化过的。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;1947年，王振铎根据“司南之杓，投之於地，其柢指南”的记载，制作了盘子上放勺子的所谓“司南”，自称磁铁在盘子上无论怎样旋转，最终会指向南方，所以自己成功地复制了“司南”。实情是因为勺子太大，在盘子上旋转时摩擦力太大，天然磁石的磁性根本无法克制摩擦力，王振铎把天然磁石放进磁场里磁化后才能达到一直指南的效果。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;古人是没有磁化技术的，所以不可能做出文献里本不存在的“司南”来，把“司南”视作指南针是不成立的。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;也有人根据中国上古典籍《吕氏春秋》《淮南子》中对磁石的记载，认为中国在上古时代就已经认识到了磁石的磁性，当时能制造出指南针。这个说法同样似是而非，认识到磁石有吸铁的磁性，不等于也认识到了磁石天然拥有指向南极的特性，对于磁石的指极性，最早也要到宋朝才有记载，所以战国秦汉是不可能发明指南针的。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;东汉张衡、曹魏马钧、南朝祖冲之发明过指南车，但指南车并不是利用磁性来指明方向，而是通过齿轮摩擦来保持车上的木人一直指着一个方向。这个发明虽然也有其价值，但是一来车轮尺寸的误差和路面不平整等因素会让木人的指向产生偏差，二来无法用于航海，所以其用处不大，因而会屡次失传屡次重新发明。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;水罗盘与旱罗盘的争议&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;不过，虽然司南是构造出来的，指南车也没那么神，但指南针确实是中国人最先发明的，这方面证据很充分。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;宋仁宗时，司天台官员杨维德的《茔原总录》中提到用指向恒定的“丙午针”来勘测风水，《武经总要》则提到了给铁片赋予磁力制成“指南鱼”，漂浮在水碗里一直指南的方法，这大约是公元1040年代的事。紧随其后的宋神宗时代，指南针已经获得较大的发展，沈括的《梦溪笔谈》就提到了水浮法、碗唇旋定法、指甲旋定法、缕悬法等四种形式的指南针，并认为缕旋法最佳。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;指南针用于航海的最早记载，则见于北宋末年朱彧的《萍洲可谈》，即所谓“舟师识地理，夜则观星，昼则观日，阴晦则观指南针”（公元1120年代）。南宋前期（1170年代）曾三异的《因话录》中提到的“地螺”，则为风水师改进看风水的堪舆设备而设计的罗经盘，罗经盘仍然是用水浮针指南，但将方位刻度细分，令人能够更精确地掌握方向，这也是世界上有记载的最早的罗盘，但还没有证据显示此时罗盘已经用于航海。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;至于旱罗盘是中国还是欧洲发明的，则有一些争议。因为根据现有文献，欧洲很可能在阿拉伯人之前已经掌握了旱罗盘。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;1190年，英国神学家亚历山大•尼坎姆在《论自然的性质》中提到了“放在支轴上的针，转动停息后会指出航行的方向”，描写得很像旱罗盘，而阿拉伯人最早记载指南针的文献是1232年穆罕默德•奥菲的《故事大全》，在欧洲人之后，而且记载的是水罗盘而非旱罗盘。有一些国外学者据此主张，中国人是发明了水罗盘且影响了伊斯兰世界，但是欧洲人独立发明了旱罗盘，并最先将其用于航海。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;不过，中国最早明确记载旱罗盘的典籍是1170年代的《因话录》，1985年又在江西临川的宋邵武知军朱济南墓（葬于1198年）中发现了手持旱罗盘的“张仙人”陶俑，则旱罗盘应该是先诞生于中国。但是其年代与欧洲记录旱罗盘的1190年过于接近，仅凭这些难以判定旱罗盘是中国传播到欧洲的，中欧各自独立发明旱罗盘仍然很有可能。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;其实中国在这之前就有一些模糊的疑似旱罗盘的记载，托名东晋郭璞的《九天玄女青囊海角经》当是唐代典籍，记载了用于指南的天盘、地盘，北宋前期王伋的风水学著作《罗经诱解》也用“虚危之间针路明，南方张度上三乘；坎离正位人难识，差却毫厘断不灵”这样一首诗记录类似罗盘的装置。很有可能中国发明旱罗盘远比南宋早，因此有时间西传到欧洲。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;不过在中国，旱罗盘一直用于堪舆风水之术，在欧洲则很快用于航海，到16世纪嘉靖年间，中国人受到东来的欧洲人启发，才将用来看风水几百年的旱罗盘用于航海。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在笃信宗教的古人那里，新发明往往最先是宗教用品，然后才投入实用，旱罗盘功能的演变也符合这条规律。但欧洲率先将习得不久的旱罗盘投入实用，技术转换成生产力的速度比中国更快，则又说明中世纪盛期的欧洲，其社会活力比中国历朝最具活力的宋朝更胜一筹。这时纠结谁先发明旱罗盘，已经不重要了。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;指南针是重要的航海技术之一&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;宋代是中国罕见的允许本国商船出海经营的时代，所以指南针和水罗盘发明后，几十年之内，12世纪后期就传给了伊斯兰世界，13世纪穆罕默德•奥菲的波斯轶闻集《故事大全》中记录了使用类似中国指南鱼的铁片寻路的故事，足以证明技术是从中国传来的。欧洲人最先把旱罗盘投入航海，但懂得利用磁针的指南特性，很可能也是受中国影响。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;指南针对于世界航海技术确实有很大的助力，对地中海地区尤其如此。地中海阴天很多，传统的根据太阳、月亮和星辰来给自己定位的导航技术，在阴雨天作用会大打折扣甚至完全失效，这时指南针的作用就弥足珍贵了。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;不过，从长远来看，指南针也只是诸多重要航海技术中的一种而已，不宜过于神化，“没有指南针就没有大航海时代”的说法更是与事实不符。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在新石器时代，大洋洲的原始人通过对洋流、天体、动物、云气的观测，已经具备非常杰出的导航技术，所以他们仅仅使用简陋的独木舟，最多装上舷外托架来装载补给、运送人员，却能从东南亚一路向东殖民太平洋岛屿，直到离南美洲不太远的复活节岛，往西他们则横穿印度洋到达了非洲的马达加斯加岛。如此波澜壮阔的上古“大航海时代”，并不需要指南针就能够实现。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;1世纪时，希腊人希帕鲁斯发现了印度洋季风的规律，从此罗马帝国的船只可以借力季风直达印度，不用再沿着海岸绕路，极大地缩短了航程，显著加强了亚欧大陆的联系，其中的技术含量只在指南针之上，不在其之下。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;8世纪以来，维京人利用简陋的分节的木棍，乃至竖起一根手臂、一只手指，观察其与特应天体的偏角，来确定自己的位置，从斯堪的纳维亚半岛一路航行到冰岛、格陵兰岛乃至美洲，也并没有指南针的身影。据此可知，就是没有指南针，哥伦布同样可以发现新大陆，只是更难一些而已。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;此外，在指南针之前和之后，其他文明也拥有诸多重要的航海技术，这些技术对航海的促进并不在指南针之下。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;比如古希腊的星盘，海员可以在星盘上排列出特定时日天空中天体的相对位置，如果水手能够确定日期与时间，就能够调整代表不同纬度的铜环，调到排列出的天体跟当下看到的天体投影位置一致时，就能确定自己的纬度。这对海员的位置指示作用还在指南针之上，只是观测天体需要晴天，会受到气候的限制。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;又如17世纪发明的四分仪、18世纪发明的六分仪，可以通过测量天体的高度来确定自己的纬度，操作比星盘更简便。白天，测量太阳与地平线的角度，夜晚，在北半球测量北极星与地平线的夹角，南半球则测量南十字座与地平线的夹角，只要移动指标臂，让太阳、北极星或南十字座与地平线对齐，就能在指标臂上得到自己所在的纬度。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;确定海员所在的经度比纬度要难得多，但到1736年，英国木匠约翰•哈里森发明了海钟，解决了这一世纪性难题。只要将海钟设定为英国格林尼治标准时间，海员无论航行到哪里，只要在太阳最高的正午时分看海钟上的时间，就能推断自己离格林尼治有多远，从而确定自己的经度。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;以上重要发明，哪一样对航海的作用都不在指南针之下，世界航海技术进步是各文明合力的结果。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;指南针在中国停滞，在欧洲进步&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;不论欧洲用旱罗盘航海是否受到中国指南针的影响，指南针都当之无愧地是中国的发明。但是很可惜，中国发明了指南针，就到此为止了，而欧洲则对旱罗盘不断改进，且通过对罗盘的研究，启发了制图学和磁学的发展。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;13世纪的法国学者佩雷格里努斯，基于对指南针的研究，想要运用磁力来作为武器的动力装置，在给朋友的信中谈到对磁性较全面的认知，开磁学研究之先河。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;14世纪初，意大利人阿马尔费塔尼发明了盘随针转的旱罗盘“罗盘卡”，令磁针的指向更加清晰。同时，意大利人也利用罗盘的方位线来绘制航海图，让航海图比欧洲中世纪的TO寰宇图大为精确。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;进入铁船时代后，欧美海员意识到铁船本身的磁力会对指南针产生干扰，他们在指南针上装一片弗林德斯顿铁，来抵消铁船磁场导致的指南针的误差，这成为19世纪铁船的通例。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;1906年，德国人H•安休兹发明了陀螺罗盘，快速旋转的陀螺仪会利用地球的自转寻找到地区的真北方向，而且不会受到地磁场和附近金属的影响，非常适合在金属载具的内部使用。陀螺轮盘很快就被欧美海军采用，后来更广泛地使用于航天领域。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;1932年，无线电罗盘在空军投入实用。无线电罗盘通过计算飞机与释放出的电波的夹角，来判定飞机前行的方向，为飞行员提供清晰的指向，在罗盘技术上又前进了一大步。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;技术只有不断使用才能发展。明清时代大体上实行闭关锁国，片板不许下海，虽然民间走私业颇为繁荣，但在朝廷的打击下，东亚的航海业仍然受到重大影响，科技停滞自然在情理之中。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;中国自周秦以来就有“天朝上国”的思想，视邻国如蛮夷，没有多少交往的热情。宋元时代是少有的例外，所以发明了指南针，但到了明清，伴随着禁海政策，与海外交流变少之后，自高自大的心态变本加厉，也阻止了民间自发地改进指南针。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;就算是相对宽松、社会较有活力的宋元时代，在秦制的管束下也仍然有其上限，以当时的货运量可能并没有迫切改进指南针的需要，所以宋代虽然难得地发明了指南针，但进一步的改进也不多。所以，只有制度宽松、观念开放、社会活跃的社会，科学技术才能蓬勃发展，这是指南针的历史给我们的启示。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;

&lt;p>;On November 11, according to the Japan Broadcasting Association (NHK), the famous Japanese dairy brand Meiji Milk announced the recall of 44,000 bottles of bottled milk that have been on the market due to the detection of veterinary drug residues in the products. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/12/9c973624a99c1a9fc552d3637d344bcc.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;602&quot; height=&quot;339&quot;

Since this substance will remain in the milk and have adverse effects on the human body, in accordance with production safety regulations, this drug must not be used on animals within 72 hours before milking. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the Japan Broadcasting Association (NHK), the milk with residual residue was produced by Meiji Dairy&#39;s Kansai factory in Kaizuka City, Osaka Prefecture, and is mainly 180 ml bottles for home delivery. On the 6th, the local government discovered veterinary drug residues during an inspection of the factory and ordered Meiji to recall the problematic products in accordance with relevant food safety regulations. So far, about 44,000 bottles of the product have been recalled. However, since the shelf life of this batch of problematic products ends on November 13, the products have been sold in many regions such as western and central Japan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the same day, Meiji Dairy Group issued a product recall announcement and stated that it would conduct a thorough investigation of the raw milk and production process to prevent similar incidents from happening again.

It is said that if you have never used or even heard a term starting with &quot;Princess please&quot;, then you are already behind the Internet trend. This new &quot;meme&quot; on the Internet is not only used as a joke between parents, children and spouses, but also used by some businesses for &quot;Double Eleven&quot; promotions and live broadcasts to bring goods. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The prototype of the line &quot;Princess please&quot; comes from the classic old movie &quot;Roman Holiday&quot;. The reporter played by Gregory Peck said &quot;Princess please&quot; to the princess played by Audrey Hepburn. &quot;Get in the car&quot;; and &quot;Princess please&quot; became an Internet meme, which originated from a funny video on Douyin: a father picked up his daughter on a bicycle, but the daughter said &quot;You said &#39;Princess please get in the car&#39;&quot;. Unexpectedly, the father did not continue riding away, leaving his daughter behind to chase him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After this funny video became popular on the short video platform, it immediately brought about a wave of imitation and secondary creation. The main promoters were short video bloggers and e-commerce platform merchants, which gave rise to &quot; More hot memes like &quot;Princess please drink tea&quot;, &quot;Princess please dine&quot;, &quot;Princess please sign for receipt&quot; and &quot;Princess please place order&quot; can be described as a victory of &quot;emotional marketing&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the carnival of &quot;Princess Please&quot; has gradually emerged with some new &quot;games&quot;, and its negative externalities are worthy of attention. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One is the &quot;identity&quot; issue of the &quot;Princess Please&quot; short video on the Internet platform. A careful review of these &quot;Princess Please&quot; videos on the short video platform can be roughly divided into three types: one is completely staged and belongs to situational skits; the other is a real shot on the spot, with immediate reactions to the real shot; the third is difficult to distinguish between true and false. It’s not marked and can’t be seen, which is problematic in itself. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These short videos are common on social media platforms: bloggers find the takeaway guy and ask him to say &quot;Princess, please dine&quot;; ask the boss at the restaurant to cooperate in filming &quot;Princess, please dine&quot;; ask the bus and An online ride-hailing driver said &quot;Princess, please get out of the car&quot;; he asked security guards at the school gate to say &quot;Princess, please go back to school&quot;; recently in Nanjing, Jiangsu, a woman who fell asked an ambulance doctor to say &quot;Princess, please get in the car&quot;; and even in Yunnan Province In a certain hospital, a surgeon appeared in the process of operating on a patient and said &quot;Please princess, please remove the electric knife&quot; and &quot;Please say thank you princess&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is obvious at a glance that most of these &quot;Princess Please&quot; short videos are fictitious and staged, but the result is that they appear to be &quot;real-looking&quot;. Such an unlabeled operation is inevitable Non-compliant. Disguising it as news to mislead the public is not without the suspicion of guiding public opinion. I would like to ask, will the proliferation of &quot;Princess Please&quot; videos create the illusion that &quot;all walks of life say &quot;Princess Please&quot; is a reality, and in turn &quot;force&quot; all walks of life to &quot;must say Princess please&quot;? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In July 2023, the Cyberspace Administration of China issued the &quot;Notice on Strengthening the Management of &quot;We-Media&quot;&quot;, which is commonly known as the &quot;Thirteen Articles&quot;, including &quot;annotation of fictitious content or controversial information&quot; Requirements for &quot;label&quot; (Article 5): When &quot;self-media&quot; publishes content that contains fictional plots and plot interpretations, the website platform should require it to mark the fiction or interpretation label in a conspicuous manner. If the staged &quot;Princess Please&quot; is not marked and deliberately makes it difficult to distinguish the authenticity, it will inevitably be suspected of violating this law. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Secondly, whether staged or real, the proliferation of &quot;Princess Please&quot; videos has brought about problems of blurred boundaries and emotional blackmail. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When parents, children and spouses say &quot;Princess please&quot;, it is an emotional interaction between close relatives; when e-commerce platform customer service personnel say &quot;Princess please&quot;, it is to use emotional marketing to promote actual transactions. Follow It is also the market principle of voluntary transactions; and if strangers who are neither relatives nor friends must be forced to say &quot;Princess please&quot; in front of the camera, and even public authorities follow the &quot;playful joke&quot;, this will cause a problem. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to those &quot;princess please&quot; short videos that are obviously staged, there is also a type of &quot;princess please&quot; that is real and even more worrying: the head teacher takes advantage of his position to ask a whole room of primary school students to shout &quot; Princess, please leave the get out of class.&quot; &quot;Beautiful princess, please leave the class.&quot; Children don&#39;t quite understand what posing is, so teaching them to cooperate in a performance only requires &quot;coercion and inducement.&quot; This approach is tantamount to using one&#39;s position to coerce children to satisfy their own emotional values ​​and help them harvest traffic. It is not compliant with the procedures and unfair in the results. It is not the way to teach and educate people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Official accounts of government departments also use &quot;Princess Please&quot; to promote laws and regulations. It seems to be a closer relationship and facilitates dissemination, but it can easily give people the impression of not being serious in the long run. It is also detrimental to popularize legal knowledge and promote citizens to abide by the law: what public authorities need is to perform their statutory duties, strictly abide by the law and strictly enforce the law. How can they show such a humble attitude of &quot;asking people to abide by the law&quot; and &quot;asking people to abide by the law&quot;? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Thirdly, the popular &quot;Princess Please&quot; is just another &quot;Internet meme&quot; destined to have a short life cycle, but it has characteristics that are different from previous &quot;Internet memes&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Princess Please&quot; is not the first-generation Internet meme of &quot;emotional marketing&quot;. Memes such as &quot;kiss&quot; and &quot;little fairy&quot; have been circulated for several times. Online language ebbs and flows, coming and going quickly. This is what is commonly known as &quot;language inflation&quot; (referred to as &quot;call inflation&quot;): just like currency, the &quot;face value&quot; of language is getting larger and larger, and the value it expresses is getting bigger and bigger. However, its &quot;value&quot; is getting smaller and smaller, and the thoughts and feelings it can carry are becoming increasingly poor. All kinds of &quot;internet memes&quot; are overused but internally poor, and have become quickly decaying words instead of meaningful idioms, which is the natural ending. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;No matter how you play &quot;Princess Please&quot;, it should still follow the principle of voluntariness, there must be boundaries, public power should not be involved, and teachers should not emotionally blackmail students. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 12 Nov 2023 15:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[涉嫌贩卖出生医学证明，广西南宁相关医院责任人已被采取刑事强制措施]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260468]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-12 15:14:51&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;The reporter learned from the Nanning Municipal Health Commission in Guangxi that people reported that a hospital in Nanning was suspected of selling medical birth certificates , the obstetrics and gynecology department of the hospital involved has been suspended for rectification, and criminal coercive measures have been taken against the relevant responsible persons of the hospital. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After a joint investigation by the health, public security and other departments, it was found that the hospital involved was Nanning Chenghe Hospital, and relevant work such as investigation and evidence collection is being further carried out.

The earliest screen known today appeared in the late Zhou Dynasty. Initially, they were used to help the owner abandon distracting thoughts and focus on contemplation and meditation. Later, they gradually became one of the living furnishings of nobles and literati, used to isolate space, block sight, and increase the sense of privacy. As the Tang Dynasty spread eastward, screens were introduced to Japan. The Japanese often placed them at the door of their homes to block the sneaky atmosphere. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/PAzTf0V0D61jhUAk8q0ZEIGxbcxPmV5dD99omqKG.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/PAzTf0V0D61jhUAk8q0ZEIGxbcxPmV5dD99omqKG.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;257466&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hide Both architecture and storage are oriental. Whether it is architecture, gardens or homes, Eastern aesthetics avoids &quot;straight to the point&quot;. Direct access is always vulgar. &quot;Shadow walls&quot; and &quot;stone screens&quot; must be built to block the line of sight. This is also in another sense. Screen - In &quot;Dream of Red Mansions&quot;, in order to welcome Concubine Yuan to the royal family, a lot of effort was put into building a luxurious Grand View Garden. As soon as he entered the garden, he first built a rockery with green peaks to cover all the scenery. Jia Zheng explained, &quot;If it weren&#39;t for this mountain, what&#39;s the point of seeing all the scenery in the garden when you enter?&quot; In one sentence, the screen was broken. The psychological motivation of existence: to welcome but also to reject, the winding path leads to the secluded place, &quot;the more you explore the scenery, the better you will get&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When screens were introduced to the West, their shapes and techniques had become diverse. People in the Baroque period even used them as props in dramas and operas, whether to beautify the stage, indicate scenery, or isolate narrative space. The performance capabilities of the screens are all top-notch. By the 19th century, many artists, architects and designers had widely adopted this form, giving screens more artistic expression. The screen therefore also has multiple identities: is it a painting or a sculpture? Is it art or furniture? Is it a practical object or a decorative item? Is it a prop or a device? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/Zv6COcmOL4pHzHQDlEu5BM8Rw5PaeU8ZZx5zVuCu.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/Zv6COcmOL4pHzHQDlEu5BM8Rw5PaeU8ZZx5zVuCu.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;257468&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;None The standard answer is that the screen answers this unsolvable proposition with its complex and diverse attitude. In modern society, &quot;screen&quot; has also been given more and more meanings. We are surrounded by various &quot;screens&quot;, isolating and attracting us. This was the inspiration for the exhibition Paraventi: Screen. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is a comprehensive exhibition that shuttles between many cultures. This one located in PRADA Rongzhai in Shanghai is a branch of its global exhibitions, and therefore has more Chinese colors. . A royal rosewood screen from the 18th century conveys the most classic and elegant appearance of the Chinese screen. This is a screen commonly used by ancient literati. The 12 surrounding screens are hinged to each other and can be arranged in an alternating pattern or in a single line. Or arranged in an arc, there is a place for posting paintings above each fan board. Generally, the owner will entrust the artist to customize a group of 12 paintings, which are painted on rice paper or silk and then pasted on the screen. Sometimes the owner himself is also proficient in it. Painting skills, painting screens have become elegant props for displaying works and offering appreciation. Ancient screens were often moved and the paintings were easily damaged. Therefore, the owners often removed their favorite works from the screen and framed them in scrolls for preservation. Therefore, the paintings on the screen could be replaced frequently. It is for this reason that most of the surviving ancient screens do not have paintings posted on them. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another common Chinese-style screen is the single-leaf vertical screen that has a history of more than 2,000 years in China. This type of screen is usually made of stone or brick. One of the screens on display in Rongzhai This kind of small stone screen is often placed on the desk. The stone wall inlaid on it has patterns that resemble mountains and rivers, and also represents the ravines in the minds of scribes. This small desk screen is not just for viewing. It has a very practical functionality. When the owner is writing and painting, the desk screen can prevent the draft from drying the ink quickly. It is one of the important study rooms. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among the many contemporary screen works in the exhibition hall, the one that amazed me the most was the work of the video artist Cao Fei, who completely transformed Rotunda No. 1 of Rongzhai into a green screen. The blue and green curtains outline oval screens, echoing the blue and green stained glass in the windows of the old bungalows. There are many images displayed in the exhibition hall, all related to &quot;green screen&quot;. As we all know, green screen and blue screen are important props in the imaging industry and are often used to create virtual scenes. Cao Fei photographed many scenes in modern life: strong men pedaling bicycles with green screens on their backs, men and women spinning green screens wildly on public fitness equipment, beauties staring at a green screen on the beach, in blue, blue, and green screens. The blue screen and green screen in the green trash can, and the fierce woman using the green screen as a target to practice fighting in the elevator room seems to be Cao Fei himself... Among all these images, images will appear intermittently on those green screens. , but will return to the green screen after a while, repeating the cycle, like a fable that is both true and false, constantly reminding us: In an era flooded with videos, everything we see and the images we see may be virtual. , untrue, and untrustworthy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/nKn2fq2DqnXA4To94A6o5CmsM5655OqlEN17GRnm.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;540&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/nKn2fq2DqnXA4To94A6o5CmsM5655OqlEN17GRnm.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;257467&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Cao Fei, Screen Autobiography (Shanghai), 2023, &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>; (artist, Vitamin Art Space and Schbutt Mag Gallery provided/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But the images that appear on the green screen are precisely images from the pre-Internet era, most of which are from the nostalgic 1980s: Spring Festival Gala, News Network, and nostalgic golden songs , female workers on the assembly line, etc. This huge difference creates a ridiculous visual tension. The environment in which the green screen exists is extremely absurd, but when pictures appear on the green screen, there is an era where we still trust images. In that era, images are true to their word and keep their word. Today, these images are like ghosts, flashing intermittently on the green screen. The green screen is filled with the most incredible places and is overwhelming in the exhibition hall. There are even many live broadcast stations carefully arranged in the green screen, which is beautiful. Sitting under the lantern, the visitors have transformed into amateur anchors! &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Cao Fei said that when she was a child, she saw prohibitive luxurious screens in the Forbidden City. In southern China where she grew up, various old-style screens with carved dragons and painted phoenixes were not uncommon. There were always Only large households with sufficient space can use screens. But what made her feel warm were the simple, warm screens that could be used by ordinary people. The light green cotton curtains were stretched on the shelves to provide the simplest shielding. People who need injections hide behind this screen and expose half of their buttocks for nurses to insert injections... But from the perspective of the image, the &quot;screen&quot; in her eyes means another kind of isolation and obstruction. &quot;With the prevalence of live broadcast culture, green screen technology has given the screen new fluidity, uncertainty and fiction, reshaping the world we see... It is like the reality behind the live video: except for a bare Outside the &#39;green screen&#39;, there is nothing.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;As a video artist, I have long distrusted images.&quot; Cao Fei said that this is exactly what she wants to express in this group of works &quot;We are truly living in an era where images are not trustworthy, reality cannot be determined, and every frame is different.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 12 Nov 2023 14:55:02 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
