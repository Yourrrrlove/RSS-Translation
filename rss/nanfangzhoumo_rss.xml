Before high school, he once wanted to be a mathematician, but &quot;because I don&#39;t have a family of my own, I decided to explore what family love is&quot; and since then entered the &quot;world of studying messy families.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When teaching in school, he used a lot of family materials to tell the origin, current situation and whereabouts of modern Japanese families. The seminars he held with students were on cutting-edge topics and discussed issues such as: To what extent do people need to &quot;rent friends&quot; when they are lonely? Does &quot;cohabiting partnership marriage&quot; (note: only cohabitation without marriage) explore another possibility beyond the current marriage system? There are more and more single young people in Japan. Where can their emotional needs for intimacy be met? He finally found some answers in cabaret clubs (note: places that provide singing and dancing performances), real or virtual idols, and pets. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the book &quot;The Low Fertility Trap&quot;, Masahiro Yamada tries to answer a question: Why are young people in Japan reluctant to have children in recent years? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Low fertility rate has always been a dark cloud lingering over Japanese society. Since 1989, Japan&#39;s fertility rate has continued to be sluggish, with the total fertility rate remaining below 1.6 for more than 30 years. In 2022, it reached a historical low of 1.26. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/15/15ki05kPI4oa4sovRe8QOk5LByuBCKIbPNPX7uAi.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height= &quot;532&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/15/15ki05kPI4oa4sovRe8QOk5LByuBCKIbPNPX7uAi.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;258344&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Since 1989, Japan&#39;s fertility rate has continued to be sluggish, with the total fertility rate below 1.6 for more than 30 years, and it reached a historical low of 1.26 in 2022 . The picture shows a still from the Japanese drama &quot;Obstetrician Kotori&quot;. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Information map/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past thirty years, Japanese society has tried to solve this &quot;stubborn disease&quot;, but with little success. Yamada Masahiro was a member of the Committee on Countermeasures against Birthrate Reduction. Once, a committee member proposed holding a publicity campaign titled &quot;Parenting is Wonderful&quot; to increase the public&#39;s enthusiasm for childbirth. &quot;Many insightful people and policy leaders in Japanese society have ignored for a long time two important factors directly related to the cause of Japan&#39;s declining birthrate, namely &#39;non-marriage&#39; and &#39;the widening gap in the economic level of young people&#39; .&quot; Yamada believes, &quot;For the majority of people who &#39;want to have children but do not have the conditions, so they do not have children&#39;, it is meaningless to carry out such publicity activities.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Yamada Masahiro&#39;s view , young people’s desire to have children is linked to the overall economic status of society. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1955, the Japanese economy entered a period of rapid growth. The prosperous economic environment gave rise to young people&#39;s positive expectations for the future. They tended to believe that through personal efforts, they could join the &quot;middle class&quot; and live a better life than their parents. A better, richer life. &quot;From World War II to about 1980, people did not think about the great risks in their economic life after marriage. At that time, men could count on becoming full-time employees, and their income would be based on the &#39;seniority system&#39; (note: wages will vary according to merit). (increasing with age and length of service).&quot; In Yamada Masahiro&#39;s view, people of that generation firmly believed that their children would grow up in a better environment than themselves. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the 1980s, the situation reversed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Entering the Heisei Era (Note: January 8, 1989), Japan&#39;s economic structure was adjusted, and a large number of informal employees (referring to fixed-term employees, part-time employees, dispatched employees, etc.) appeared. Social gaps have arisen in terms of employment, which in turn has led to gaps between the rich and poor families and the educational environment of their children, and the polarization of society has further developed.&quot; Masahiro Yamada said in an interview with Japanese media, &quot;For most informal employees, regardless of whether No matter how hard I try, I can&#39;t earn the income that will allow me to live a prosperous life in the future, nor can I get married and start a family. In other words, my future has become hopeless.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yamada observed, The Japanese pay more attention to the significance of marriage from an economic perspective and will make a careful risk assessment before making a decision to get married. The evaluation often starts from two perspectives: first, whether the standard of living after marriage will be better than before marriage, or at least not worse; second, whether after marriage, the child can create a better growth environment than oneself. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Behind this view on marriage and childbearing are the unique values ​​of modern Japanese society: the hope to avoid risks in future life. The Japanese regard maintaining a middle-class living standard as their highest goal and believe that in life design, The series of issues of &#39;men and women dating&#39;, &#39;marriage&#39;, &#39;childbirth&#39;, &#39;child rearing&#39; and &#39;children&#39;s education&#39; are not single and separated, but are intertwined.&quot; Yamada Masahiro in the paper &quot;East Asian Characteristics of the Low Birth Rate Problem&quot; wrote. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This awareness of risk also extends to the relationship stage. Yamada found that in Japan, many young people are even losing their desire to fall in love. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;NHK Broadcasting Culture Research Institute once conducted a survey on Japanese middle and high school students and found that the proportions of middle and high school students who &quot;have a crush&quot; were 41% and 54% respectively in 1982. In 2012, this figure dropped sharply to 25% and 31%. In 2014, the Japanese Cabinet Office conducted a survey on young people and found that more than one-third of the respondents preferred to spend time on work and study, and 46.2% felt that &quot;love is troublesome.&quot; In Yamada Masahiro’s view, “trouble” may mean “not cost-effective”. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the 1990s, when the phenomenon of declining birthrate first appeared in Japanese society, demographers held a mainstream view: young people just postponed marriage to enjoy single life, and one day they would get married. . Masahiro Yamada believes that such a logical basis may not be established. Over the past few decades, as Japanese society has gradually developed into a &quot;high-consumption society&quot;, the anxiety and pressure of childcare has also hit young people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/15/sZwSWsI8dblFzL7uTjuuPTz6YmJTOauI6ffsygCC.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/15/sZwSWsI8dblFzL7uTjuuPTz6YmJTOauI6ffsygCC.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;258345&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In December 2022, on the streets of Tokyo, Japan, a couple took wedding photos on the streets decorated with Christmas lights. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China Map/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2015, Japan’s National Institute of Social Security and Population Issues conducted a survey on 30 -Why married women in the 34-year-old age group fail to have the expected number of children? 81.1% of the survey respondents believe that the reason is that &quot;the raising and education of children is too expensive.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Yamada’s view, modern society’s expectations for the function of marriage and childbearing are different from pre-modern society. In a society centered on agricultural production, childbirth means supplementing the labor force. Parents place expectations on their children to inherit the family business and take care of their parents later in life. Children are a kind of &quot;productive property.&quot; But after the 1950s, Japan began to &quot;nuclear family&quot; with reference to the family system in Europe and the United States. A couple and their unmarried children became the basic family unit. In modern society, raising children requires a large amount of childcare money, and children have therefore become &quot;consumable property.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;The significance of children as a labor force no longer exists, and when the nuclear family becomes a principle, it is difficult to expect children to provide support and care in their old age. In addition, parents who can let their children inherit the family business It has also become less.&quot; Yamada Masahiro wrote in &quot;The Low Birth Trap&quot; that unlike European and American parents who enjoy the joy and fun of parenting itself, many times, East Asian parents care about whether to have a &quot;high-value&quot; child—— In the social evaluation system established by external factors such as academic qualifications and work, whether children can take the top spot. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yamada believes that East Asian parents often have a &quot;protective feeling&quot; for their children and do not want their children to &quot;live a hard life&quot;. It is also part of the value of parents for children to receive help from their parents when they receive higher education and even become adults. . As a result, the age of responsibility of East Asian parents for their children has been extended indefinitely. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In October 2023, Japanese sociologist Masahiro Yamada accepted a written interview with a reporter from Southern Weekend. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;East Asian parents take it for granted that they spend money on their children&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: italics, Italics_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;China&#39;s total fertility rate fell to 1.09 in 2022, which is lower than Japan&#39;s 1.26 and higher than South Korea&#39;s 0.78. In 2022, the total fertility rate of the three East Asian countries dropped to historical lows. You have done a lot of research on fertility wishes in Japan. Why are young people reluctant to have children? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Masahiro Yamada:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;In East Asia (China, Japan and South Korea), marriage and childcare are first considered from an economic perspective. When people raise children, they will want to spend more money on their children than their parents raised themselves. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past (50 years ago in Japan and 30 years ago in China and South Korea), the lives of most young people’s parents and the lives of young people themselves were relatively poor. And since society as a whole is in a period of economic growth, young people&#39;s future income can be expected to increase. So, at that time, it would be easier, and in fact it was, to spend more money on your own children than your own parents had raised. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, starting 30 years ago in Japan and 10 years ago in China and South Korea, the children of the previous generation whose parents spent more money to raise them now have to spend money to raise their own children. These young people often have parents who are wealthier than themselves. In China, due to the large number of only children, the cost of this generation of only children is estimated to be more than twice that of Japan and South Korea. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is very difficult to spend more money on children born in the future when economic growth is slowing down. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;The process of family modernization in East Asian society is to imitate and learn from the European and American nuclear family. Process and the same social model, why do East Asian countries currently face more severe fertility difficulties than European and American societies? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Masahiro Yamada:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;East Asian countries only imitate the nuclear family model, but due to different social environments and traditions, the feedback these models receive will naturally vary. different. For example, parents in East Asia believe that spending money on children is natural and can bring a lot of emotional value; they believe in the love between parents and children more than the love between husband and wife. This also leads to a significant reduction in the need for marriage if one does not plan to have children. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Europe and the United States believe that it is necessary to raise children until adulthood, while East Asian countries believe that it is natural to bear the cost of higher education for children. In contrast, parents in East Asian countries have to shoulder more childcare responsibilities and often need help solving various problems their children encounter even after they become adults. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;In the past few years, the Chinese government has introduced some policies to encourage childbirth. For example, the three-child policy and the establishment of a childcare subsidy system have been proposed in many places. You said in &quot;The Low Fertility Trap&quot; that the Japanese government failed to seize the best opportunity to intervene in low fertility, and Japan&#39;s low birthrate policy failed. What lessons and inspiration can Japan’s experience bring to other countries? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Masahiro Yamada:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;We must consider reducing the burden of children’s education fees. A quarter of young people feel uneasy about the future, which is the main reason for Japan&#39;s declining birthrate. Measures should be taken so that young people will not feel insecure about not being able to live a prosperous life in the future. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We must transform our society into a society where every young person has hope that his children will not suffer in the future. That is, building a society where jobs are re-startable, equally friendly to two-income families, and where social security can help us get back on our feet if things go wrong. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Can you combine your own with that of your previous and next generations? Experience, talk about the changes in the situation and concepts of marriage and childbirth among young people in Japan? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Yamada Masahiro: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;The concept itself has not changed much. If there is an expectation of living a relatively good life, then it is natural to get married and have children. The difference may be that people of the previous generation would have thought that they could live a prosperous life on their husband&#39;s income alone (about 30 years ago). Even today, nearly three-quarters of young people who are able to meet expectations are already married and have children. The reason why the remaining one-quarter of young people do not choose to get married and have children is mostly because their income is unstable and they are unable to They expect to live a relatively good life after getting married and having children. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Is marriage and childbirth a matter of decency? &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You put forward a point: wait for the one that suits you The idea that a partner appears and then gets married was once generally accepted, but now it is difficult to bring people into marriage. If today&#39;s young people want to get married, they need to participate in &quot;marriage activities&quot; (note: various activities to find marriage partners, first proposed by Yamada Masahiro). Why is there such a change? Isn’t it possible to get married if you don’t participate in the wedding ceremony? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Masahiro Yamada:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Because there are fewer places where young people can meet each other naturally. Not to mention men, even women&#39;s so-called &quot;men will take the initiative to strike up a conversation even if they don&#39;t take the initiative&quot; has become less common. The community or enterprises have to provide some opportunities so that young men and women can have more contact. If you want to find a marriage partner, you should still take active action. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;&quot;Marriage&quot; is called blind date in China. For people born in the 1970s and 1980s in China, free love and marriage were a common view on marriage and love when they were young, but among today&#39;s young people, the concept of being well-matched is being revived. Are there similar changes in the concept of marriage in Japanese society? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Masahiro Yamada:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;In Japan, the consciousness of “fall in love first and then get married” has not changed. Young people&#39;s longing for love and marriage and their distaste for parents interfering with free love are still relatively strong. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although we don’t care so much about the target’s family background, the economic life after marriage, that is, the overall family income of the couple after marriage, is a very important reference factor. Today&#39;s young people have a very strong sense of being &quot;middle-class.&quot; Most of them feel that they were in a middle-class life when they were with their parents, so they really don&#39;t want to fall from the middle-class life after marriage. This is also a habit of &quot;avoiding risks&quot; and &quot;valuing respectability.&quot; reflection of Japanese social characteristics. However, Japan does not have the custom like China that the male family needs to contribute a lot of money when getting married. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You seem to place great emphasis on analyzing the motivations for marriage and childbirth at the economic level. . You mentioned that in European and American societies, people do not strongly associate building a family (getting married, having children) with economic status, but not in East Asian societies. Why do East Asian societies place so much emphasis on the correlation between the two? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Masahiro Yamada:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;East Asians value decency more, which is “face” in Chinese. People don’t want to be seen as having an unhappy marriage or poor parenting. There is a strong sense of shame associated with living a poor life. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Europe and the United States, love between husband and wife is the expression of happiness, and the awareness that living in poverty can also be happy is very popular; in East Asian societies, even without love between husband and wife, living A rich life can also be a happy one, and this awareness is very strong. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;There is a view that in modern families, &quot;the male is the dominant one and the female is the dominant one.&quot; The division of labor within the family means that women have to devote more time and energy to childcare. What do you think of this practical problem? How does Japanese society respond to this? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Masahiro Yamada:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;It is gradually becoming a prerequisite for a wealthy family to have a certain income and continue working for women. Since there are only a limited number of high-income men who can do &quot;men take care of the outside world and women take care of the house&quot;, in order to raise children in affluent living conditions, it has become very necessary for women to work outside the home and for men to participate in housework. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Japan, this ideal is gradually becoming a reality by popularizing maternity leave and improving the construction of kindergartens. However, the Japanese government&#39;s &quot;two-dimensional support&quot; for women&#39;s work and childcare is obviously far from enough. It is still necessary to continue to improve the working environment, eliminate gender discrimination, and allow more women to engage in meaningful work. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Cultivating &quot;high-value&quot; children, a twisted expectation&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font -family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You mentioned that young people in Japan have the idea that &quot;children cannot be allowed to suffer&quot;.

The meaning of life. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, the awareness of discrimination among children is also very strong. Today&#39;s young people are worried that their poverty will cause their children to be bullied. When children play together, they sometimes need external hardware like Switch game consoles.

This idea among young parents is becoming more and more intense. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past, it was enough for parents to be able to stay with their children, but now more and more parents feel that it will be uncomfortable if they cannot spend enough money on their children. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;In China, unmarried men and women of working age may be harassed by their parents and elders Those who urge marriage are called bachelors or leftover women, which has a certain derogatory meaning. Is there a similar situation in Japan? How do you understand this phenomenon? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Masahiro Yamada: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Single = unpopular. This equation will indirectly remind people of whether the reason for not getting married is because men have low incomes. , or is it because there is something wrong with women’s appearance. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Japan, because the unmarried rate is very high, people who want to get married but can’t, and people who can but don’t want to get married are mixed together, so simply treating unmarried people Put downs are uncommon. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Also because the unmarried rate is very high, the pressure from parents is much less than before. Many parents will think that it is better for their children to stay at home alone than to let their children marry someone with a low income and then live a less than ideal life of poverty. In Japan, a growing number of parents believe it is better to keep their children single than to be hung up on strange marriage partners. The awareness of inheriting the family business is gradually declining in Japan (people over 70 years old still have a strong awareness of this awareness). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You mentioned that in pre-modern society, children were a kind of &quot; &quot;Producive property&quot; becomes &quot;consumer property&quot; in modern society, requiring a higher investment in childcare.

In East Asian cultural circles, this awareness of face or vanity is very strong. From an emotional point of view, this stems from parents&#39; desire for their children to live a carefree life financially. Although the original intention is good, with the comparison psychology brought about by the consciousness of decency, raising high-value children has become a distorted expectation. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;European and American traditions are very different. When children become adults, they no longer depend on their parents financially and have a strong sense of self-responsibility.

However, with the development of globalization, economic risks are increasing, and today&#39;s young people can no longer afford it.

South Korea has the &quot;Three Abandonments&quot; (giving up on love, marriage, and childbirth), Japan has &quot;herbivore men&quot; (passive and inactive in love), and some young people in China think falling in love is troublesome. Why do young people lose the desire to fall in love? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Masahiro Yamada: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Because modern young people feel that love relationships will always &quot;cool down.&quot; In Europe and the United States, &quot;being with the person you love&quot; is the meaning of life. However, this idea is not widespread in East Asian countries. In the eyes of many people, falling in love is actually a process of finding a marriage partner. Therefore, they also believe that dating someone who knows they cannot get married is a waste of time and money. More and more people believe that love itself is a matter of worrying about other people&#39;s unhappiness. Because of the expansion of the porn industry, especially in Japan, the sexual value of dating has also decreased. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 凯体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Many people meet their love needs through virtual relationships, such as The popular AI boyfriends and girlfriends, or &quot;CP addicts&quot;, gain emotional satisfaction from watching others fall in love.

Some people also question that obtaining emotional satisfaction through data calculation and monetary payment weakens the complexity of love. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Yamada Masahiro:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Although I think this is a form of escape, for today&#39;s young people, there are more and more People think this is a more enjoyable time of communication than real love. If the satisfaction of real love decreases, the value of virtual love will increase. Maybe it can no longer be said that satisfaction in reality is superior. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;In 1997 you named the &quot; In recent years, &quot;full-time children&quot; have also appeared in Chinese society, that is, children give up their jobs and go home to take care of housework and provide for their parents. Living expenses are borne by their parents, and some full-time children will also receive wages from their parents. You seem to be interested in emphasizing the connection between &quot;single parasites&quot; and the desire to marry and have children. Can you expand on this? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Yamada Masahiro:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>; Before meeting your ideal marriage partner, living a prosperous life with your parents, this kind of &quot;waiting&quot; is very likely There is no end. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Europe and the United States, because adults must be independent from their parents, it is more advantageous for two young people to live together. But in East Asian countries, independence from parents generally means that children can live a better life outside than at home with their parents. It’s okay to “wait” at your parents’ house before meeting the person you want to marry with whom you can live a better life together. Even your parents are looking forward to it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, we have never been able to wait for the ideal person to appear, and there is an endless stream of &quot;former&quot; young people who are slowly aging like this.

It&#39;s really not that difficult to come here. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, in East Asian countries, young people compare themselves with their parents. More and more young people believe that failure to reach the level of their parents is a failure. This is especially true for people who live a prosperous life under the care of their parents. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, in Japan, many young people believe that employment and marriage cannot be repeated, which is also one of the important influencing factors. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 16 Nov 2023 10:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[贫困生攒钱看演唱会惹争议，该不该限制助学对象高消费？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260617]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-16 08:30:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https:// feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange &quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 16 Nov 2023 08:55:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[习近平同美国总统拜登举行中美元首会晤]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260688]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-16 08:43:26&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;video id=&quot;contents-video-0&quot; data-fileid=&quot;3270835011765296853&quot; data-media=&quot; video&quot; data-resource=&quot;tencent&quot; data-filename=&quot;Exclusive video丨Xi Jinping and US President Biden held the China-US Presidential Meeting.mp4&quot; data-cover=&quot;http://1251434507.vod2.myqcloud.com/d9dca36avodtranscq1251434507/ 79e1b7263270835011765296853/sampleSnapshot/sampleSnapshot_10_0.jpg&quot; data-url=&quot;http://1251434507.vod2.myqcloud.com/02f2b5c2vodcq1251434507/79e1b726327083501176 5296853/8IaqSQsxTcYA.mp4&quot; poster=&quot;&quot; controls=&quot;controls&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot; 360&quot;>; &lt;source src=&quot;http://1251434507.vod2.myqcloud.com/02f2b5c2vodcq1251434507/79e1b7263270835011765296853/8IaqSQsxTcYA.mp4&quot; type=&quot;video/mp4&quot;>;&lt;/video>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Local time 11 On March 15, President Xi Jinping held a China-US Presidential Meeting with US President Joe Biden at Philori Estate in San Francisco, USA. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xi Jinping pointed out that the last time Mr. President and I met was in Bali, and it has been a year. A lot has happened in the past year. The world has emerged from the COVID-19 pandemic, but the huge impact of the epidemic remains. The world economy has begun to recover, but it lacks momentum, industrial and supply chains are disrupted, and protectionism is on the rise. These problems are very prominent. As the most important bilateral relationship in the world, China-U.S. relations must be thought and planned against the backdrop of the accelerating changes in the world over the past century, so as to bring benefits to the people of both countries and demonstrate responsibility for human progress. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xi Jinping pointed out that over the past 50 years, Sino-US relations have never been smooth sailing. There will always be problems of one kind or another, and they will always move forward amid twists and turns. It is impossible for such two big countries not to deal with each other. It is unrealistic to try to change each other. No one can bear the consequences of conflict and confrontation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I still have the same view. Great power competition is not the background of this era and cannot solve the problems facing China, the United States and the world. This earth can accommodate China and the United States, and our respective successes are opportunities for each other. China and the United States have different histories, cultures, social systems, and development paths. This is an objective reality. However, as long as both sides adhere to mutual respect, peaceful coexistence, and win-win cooperation, they can transcend differences and find a way for the two major countries to get along correctly. I firmly believe that the future of Sino-US relations is bright. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The President and I are at the helm of Sino-US relations and bear heavy responsibilities for the people, the world, and history. I look forward to having an in-depth exchange of views and reaching new consensus with Mr. President today on strategic, overall and directional issues related to China-US relations, as well as major issues related to world peace and development. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 16 Nov 2023 08:55:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[被摘牌的55个中华老字号：停产、换新店、准备重申]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260668]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-16 08:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;The Ministry of Commerce will review 1,128 time-honored brands in 2023.

Those that have been operating poorly for a long time have even gone bankrupt, canceled, closed down, or have lost the ownership and use rights of registered trademarks of time-honored brands. 55 brands were removed from the list of Chinese time-honored brands; 73 brands with poor operations and declining performance were required to be rectified within 6 months; 1,000 brands with standardized operations and good development were continued to be retained. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wujia Bacon is one of the 55 brands. Chinese time-honored brands were first selected by the former Ministry of Domestic Trade, and more than 1,600 were rated in 1991. In 2006, the Ministry of Commerce re-certified 429 Chinese time-honored brands in the first batch; in 2010, the Ministry of Commerce recognized 699 in the second batch. As of the beginning of 2023, there are 1,128 Chinese time-honored brands across the country. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In January 2023, in order to promote the innovative development of time-honored brands, the Ministry of Commerce and other five departments issued the &quot;Measures for the Administration of the Demonstration Creation of Chinese Time-honored Brands&quot; (hereinafter referred to as the &quot;Measures&quot;). In this &quot;Measures&quot;, the &quot;Measures&quot; were established The &quot;traffic light&quot; mechanism, that is, the dynamic management mechanism of &quot;in and out&quot;, takes rectification or removal measures for time-honored brands that do not meet the requirements. In February 2023, the Ministry of Commerce publicly stated that the &quot;honor&quot; of China&#39;s time-honored brands is not once and for all, let alone resting on the credit book to &quot;show off seniority&quot; or &quot;rest on one&#39;s laurels.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Three months after the &quot;Measures&quot; were issued, the Ministry of Commerce, together with the Ministry of Culture and Tourism and other ministries and commissions, decided to review the existing Chinese time-honored brands and carry out the certification of a new batch of Chinese time-honored brands, so that time-honored brands can &quot;come in and out&quot; . This is the first time that Chinese time-honored brands have been reviewed since they were recognized, but it is not the last time. The &quot;Measures&quot; stipulate that in principle, a new batch of Chinese time-honored brands will be recognized and published every three years. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;55 time-honored brands delisted&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;As of this delisting, Wujia Bacon has been a time-honored brand in China for nearly 30 years. In the early 1990s, Wujia Bacon in Linfen City, Shanxi Province was rated as a Chinese time-honored brand by the former Ministry of Domestic Trade. At that time, Wu Zhiyong, who had just grown up, as the fifth generation successor, was learning the ancestral condiment formula and processing technology from the basics. Now he has reached the age where he knows his destiny. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wu Zhiyong told Southern Weekend reporters that because he was busy launching a new production line at the time, he did not pay enough attention to the review. At the same time, it took too much time to search and complete historical data, resulting in missing the time to submit materials. Wu Zhiyong speculated that the removal may be due to Article 20 of the &quot;Measures&quot;: Enterprises are bankrupt, liquidated, disbanded, canceled, have their business licenses revoked, or have not carried out business activities for more than three years. They will be removed from the list of Chinese time-honored brands and the right to use the Chinese time-honored brand logo and plaque will be recovered. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The company owned by Wujia Bacon is Wujiabaoxing Bacon Products Co., Ltd. in Yaodu District, Linfen City. The company was liquidated in 2017. Wu Zhiyong explained that the company was jointly run by his father Wu Baoshan and his second uncle. Due to their old age and poor health, and the original bacon processing factory was demolished due to urban expansion in 2014, the two &quot;retired&quot;, and the Wu family bacon business also hiatus for 6 years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Among the 55 brands that have been removed from the Chinese time -honored list, there are not a few similar to Wujia&#39;s meat smoking. The southern weekend reporters combed and found that most of the brand companies that were removed from the list showed cancellation, bankruptcy, removing names, etc., and even seriously violated the law. Some legal representatives of some companies were also listed as dishonestyes to be executed, restricting high consumption. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Southern weekend reporters tried to contact the 55 brands on the list. Except for some of them, most of them refused to interview. Among the small number of interviewed brands, the causes of the delisting are different. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The person in charge of the Shanxi Yanhu brand told the southern weekend reporter: &quot;When the last order on the handle is done, it will never be done.&quot; Produced, just maintain this brand. Shouchuntang, Anhui said that it is changing a new store and waiting for a new place. The person in charge of Shanxi Mingquan said that the enterprise is still open, but it is not produced. The person in charge of the Shandong Shi toad brand said that he did not know that he was &quot;kicked out&quot; the old Chinese name. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; A reporter from the Southern Weekend Consulting the Department of Circulation Development of the Ministry of Commerce as a merchant, and the other party replied: &quot;The reason for being removed is all kinds. . &quot;&lt;/P>; &lt;p>; In real scenes, the loss of some Chinese old names is even more intuitive. In 2010, the Beijing Chinese Women&#39;s Underwear, which was approved by the Ministry of Commerce, was founded in 1938. It is the first women&#39;s product specialty store in Beijing. It has proposed to let Chinese women wear &quot;Chinese girls&quot; underwear. The Chinese women&#39;s underwear, which once opened a store on Wangfujing Street, can not be found anymore. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Linlang wedding photography shop, which was once located in the Shangjiu commercial neighborhood of Guangzhou City. It was founded in 1947. At that time, it was the largest photography store in Liwan District. Now the store has been occupied by sports brands. The nearly 80 -year -old Chen Mo Chen recalled to the reporter from the Southern Weekend that the previous photography museum was a two -story ride building, which belongs to a high -end consumer brand. He had taken a work photo in the Linlang Photography Museum in the 1970s, but he had not taken wedding photos. &quot;Inside,&quot; inside One is used for taking pictures, making a lobby outside, relatively high -end, there are quite a lot of people. &quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;img alt = &quot;On the eve of the Chung Yeung Festival in 2023, citizen tourists lined up to buy the Chongyang cakes of the old brand of Shanghai.

Visual China Map &lt;/p>; &lt;H4>; Plan to return to the old -fashioned list &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; I was removed from the time -honored list. Although Wu Zhiyong regretted it, he was not discouraged: &quot;We are painful, and the brand cannot stay on the family business model. We are confident that the next declaration (Chinese old -fashioned) must be successful. &quot;According to the&quot; Measures &quot;, those who have been removed from the Chinese time -honored list shall not be declared again during the two declaration cycles from the date of decision. In other words, Wu Zhiyong could not declare again until 2032. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; However, the business of Wujia smoked meat does not seem to be affected. The Chinese old Chinese old plaque has not been notified for recovery. , Lost losses. At the end of 2020, Wu Zhiyong and his younger brother Wu Zhijun raised a new factory. Today, this 6 -acre factory can produce about 800 kg of meat per day for 4 local stores to sell. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Compared with the productivity during the fourth -generation inheritance, the area of ​​the new factory has been reduced but the production capacity has increased. According to Wu Zhiyong, his secret recipe was prepared by his ancestors as Langzhong in the three years of Guangxu (1877). The secret recipe has about 22 Chinese herbal medicines. Different ingredients are used in different seasons. Pork, beef, chicken, rabbit meat and other ingredients are also different, and even different parts of materials are different. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Wu Zhiyong told the southern weekend reporter that for many years, the secret recipe of Wu Jia&#39;s meat has always been taught. He recalled that he and his brother were brought to the ingredient room by his father. There were no windows in the ingredient room. There was only one door. The father taught them the formula used by cooking pig&#39;s head in summer. Lose. Not only that, the formula can be passed on to the daughter -in -law. Wu Zhiyong said that his father&#39;s 7 brothers have completed the inheritance; 10 cousins ​​of his generation are currently operating; now, the baton is slowly handed over to the sixth generation. Among this generation, in this generation, There are 10 men, 9 of them are not yet adult. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Today, Wu Yazhou, the sixth generation of inheritors, began to learn how to ingredients, as well as crafts such as washing, brewing, pickling, cooking, smoking, and drying. Wu Zhiyong revealed that Wu Yazhou, a 25 -year -old, did not fully master the component of the secret recipe. When he was 35 -year -old, he could not teach the secret recipe. Another inheritor is Wu Yiyong&#39;s son Wu Yaxuan. He is still studying in high school. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Wu Zhiyong feels that Wu Jia smoked meat who lost the title of Chinese old name is not only a kind of food, but also the hard work and bitterness of the older generation. He wants to carry him forward. Nowadays, the new factory is debugging a high -temperature sterilization soft packaging production line. After the debugging, the product can be pushed to the foreign market. Not only that, he intends to introduce live broadcasts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; On November 9th, the Ministry of Commerce disclosed the results of the review results of the Chinese old name, and the spokesman of the Ministry of Commerce, He Yadong, said that in 2022, the old Chinese -branded enterprise achieved operating income exceeded 1.2 trillion yuan, and nearly 70 % of the enterprises achieved profitability. . In the first three quarters of 2023, operating income exceeded the annual level of 2022. The Ministry of Commerce will further establish a long -term mechanism for the protection and inheritance and innovative development of the old -fashioned name, to promote the deep -digging cultural heritage, the advanced concept of the benchmark, the development of innovation and development, and better play the role of demonstration. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 16 Nov 2023 08:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[中山大学通报“贫困生炫富”：终止发放助学金]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260686]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;i>; 2023-11-15 23:46:35 &lt;/i>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>; On the evening Zhao Moumou was reported to respond to showing off wealth and excessive consumption. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The notification stated that after verification, the student was identified as the identification procedure specification and materials of the students of the family&#39;s economic difficulties, and complied with relevant regulations.

Just like the classic lines of Andy Lau in &quot;Infernal Affairs&quot;, &quot;I didn&#39;t choose before, now I want to be a good person.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The &quot;A Fragrance for Dark&quot; and &quot;Ning An Ru Meng&quot; mentioned in the previous article can be attributed to this category. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The first episode of &quot;For the Side of the A fragrance&quot; is that Hua Qian&#39;s family was sanctioned and witnessed the death of her father and mother. Will you make a change? &quot;A&quot; I will &quot;laid the tone of the whole drama. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;img src = &quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/13/5332a69b1d633F364545098effa.png&quot; 0 &quot;width =&quot; 10800 &quot; &quot;height = &quot;607&quot; data-src = &quot;// Images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/13/53329b1d633F364545098effa.png&quot; data-key = &quot;258140&quot;>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;IM G SRC = &quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/13/A38F9135DFD9BC86E14FAEE19A7DE622.png&quot; 0 &quot;width =&quot; 1080 &quot;&quot; 624 &quot;&quot; 624 &quot; data-src = &quot;// Images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/13/a38F9135DFD9BC86E14FAEE19A7DE622.png &quot;data-key =&quot; 258141 &quot;>; &lt;/p>;&quot; Ning An Ru Meng &quot;added the original text. A blocked attraction: Modern female writers are writing a book about the behind -the -shelf of the demon (this is the first), and suddenly decided to change the female lead Jiang Xuening&#39;s settings (this is the second generation) and write down &quot;This time, Jiang Xuening , Never enter the palace. &quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;img src = &quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/13/c0F57245E9382395d0ca92F7E2.png&quot; width = &quot;0&quot; 10800000000000080 &quot;height = &quot;597&quot; data-src = &quot;// Images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/13/c0f57245e9382395d0ca92.png&quot; data- key = &quot;258142&quot;>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;IM G SRC = &quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/13/11c564e31885728c60d3d2caa117307.jpeg&quot; border = &quot;0&quot; width = &quot;1080&quot; height = &quot;597777777 &quot;data-src =&quot; // Images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/13/11c564e31885728dd3d2caa117307.jpeg &quot;data-key =&quot; 258139 &quot;>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Both Hua Qian and Jiang Xuening&#39;s life reopen their lives. With the original intention of &quot;goodness&quot;, can you be repaid as you want? Is the river of fate so easy to figure out? Of course, the answer is negative. With the &quot;unfinished complex&quot;, it is persistent and forced psychology. Driven by the mentality of &quot;I want to force&quot;, the restart life may not be perfect. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Repentance brings knowledge of shame and honor, so Hua Qian becomes humble and polite, seriously in front of the uncle&#39;s wife, and work hard to have a good relationship with the people around him. In order to make up for the female No. 2 in the previous life, Hua Qian also tried to match her relationship with the uncle. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;img src = &quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/2629219492c455BD6625EBFF7B358.jpeg&quot; width = &quot;0&quot; width = &quot;108 0 &quot;Height = &quot;608&quot; data-src = &quot;// Images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/13/2629219492c455BD6625EBFF7B358.JPEG&quot; Data-Key = &quot;258143&quot;>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Change After, the attitude of everyone has also changed. The previous life agencies have not loved that no one loves it. The episode has fallen into the emotional line of a vulgar female VS three men: the uncle who is swaying, the loyalty of the family, and the loyal guard, how should you choose? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;img src = &quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/13/4e82acBECAC76ed87053bbcc1f02cc.jpeg&quot; width = &quot;0&quot; 102 4 &quot;Height = &quot;683&quot; data-src = &quot;// Images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/13/4e82acbecac76ed8705a53bbcc1f02cc.jpeg&quot; data- key = &quot;258144&quot;>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Side, Jiang Xuening&#39;s restarting life is focusing on the pit.

The individual expression is transformed from the &quot;suffering&quot; of the identity to the &quot;responsible person&quot;. Hua Qian and Jiang Xuening were hateful, but they were also affordables of tragic fate. In this life, they opened their eyes and began to learn to bear self -right and self -responsibility. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; But the subsequent development of the episode still goes to the myth of fate theory. I have heard a lot of truths and learned to be a good person, but can avoid tragedy A and cannot escape the tragedy B. The design of fate can always give people people. Surprise and fright. The TV series requires such a wave of twists and turns to better constitute the drama tension, but it has also led to the endless psychological expectations of the audience. In fact, we don&#39;t want to watch the plot that is too sad, especially it is a rebirth drama. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; A good person rebirth of revenge drama is actually more in line with the physique of the drama. A good person who is everywhere has fallen into the trap of others and stepped into the abyss step by step. If we can live again, we must see him kill the Quartet. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; This is why &quot;The Temptation of Going Home&quot; becomes a classic, Lin Pinru fell down, and Gao Shanshan stood up. Although it was not a rebirth drama, the psychological root was consistent. As the Bacon said, &quot;revenge is a barbaric justice&quot;, &quot;to return the eyes with the eyes, and return to the teeth&quot;, which is in line with the audience&#39;s imagination of pleasure and revenge. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Last year&#39;s domestic drama &quot;Flowing Year&quot; and the Korean drama &quot;The Little Son of the Metropolitan Family&quot; were all re -born revenge dramas. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The first three episodes of &quot;The Year of the Covering&quot; finished the previous life of the heroine Lu Anran at 5 times the speed. He was a good wife, a good mother, a good daughter and a good sister, but it was difficult to escape the fate. Episode 4 was born again, and she found that everything was not accidental. Each step contained the calculation of her husband by the pillow, and she decided to revenge and justice to justice. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;img src = &quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/74d5D3556cce35FF1AA4174A6170C8D2.JPEG&quot; width = &quot;0&quot; 108 0 &quot;Height = &quot;720&quot; data-src = &quot;// Images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/13/74d5556cce35FF1AA4174A6170C8D2.JPEG&quot; Data-Key = &quot;258148&quot;>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;Caisai Valve home In the &quot;Little Son of&quot; Song Zhongji, the underlying migrant worker played by Song Zhongji was killed after squeezing the value. After rebirth, he became the grandson of the chaebol family, and the enemies of the previous life were hidden in the relatives of this life. The object of his revenge is not only a figurative person, but also the chaebol of the entire eaters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;img src = &quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/13/6600b99e4a3d180d1b13fccd393f.jpeg&quot; width = &quot;1080&quot; width = &quot;108000&quot; &quot;height = &quot;720&quot; data-src = &quot;// Images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/13/6600b99e4a3d180d1b13fccd393f.jpeg&quot; data-key = &quot;258146&quot;>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Good people heavy Revenge The play emphasizes pain and pleasure. The protagonist was forbearing all the way, experiencing the situation that ordinary people could not bear, pain in TA body, pain in the hearts of the audience. The desperate counterattack when being squeezed into the extreme point is the point of view, so the audience expects the golden finger on the road of rewarding. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Put aside the problems used to the rebirth drama — the ending of the Thunder is not discussed, the word of mouth of &quot;The Year of the Overwhelming&quot; and &quot;The Little Son of the Metropolitanian&quot; is very different during the drama. The former was scolded by the audience by the audience &quot;So aggrieved and reborn for a loneliness&quot;, the latter triggered the upsurge of the whole people&#39;s chasing drama. Everyone wants to see how cool the protagonist controls the Korean economy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The root cause of the problem lies in: rebirth of revenge dramas, cool words, the audience does not want to think too much, I just want to see the hero&#39;s gorgeous turn. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The male lead played by Song Zhongji is just a pawn of the chaebol family. The internal affairs are meticulous, and foreign affairs must be caring. He has no ambitions and desires. Just salary. Who would have thought that when he turned the serfs to sing and became the heir of the chaebol group, he could not only use the information to collect money crazy, but also crushed the enemies in all aspects. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;img src = &quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/787F226CFA122356163CF5A242439723.jpeg&quot; width = &quot;0&quot; width = &quot;108 0 &quot;Height = &quot;459&quot; data-src = &quot;// Images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/787F226CFA122356163CF5A242439723.JPEG&quot; Data- &quot;>; 258150&quot;>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Land land An Ranzi Otherwise, she worked hard to operate the second generation, but found that she could not open the plug -in, not as good as her husband who was black and yin, and the natural cold husband.

However, unfortunately, the relevant discussions of multiple social platforms have exceeded the incident itself and become a vent of various emotions and contradictions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Some of them also put forward a series of virtuous virtues. As one of the thinking cornerstones of traditional Chinese culture, the Confucian sages in the pre -Qin period in a series of thinking between the relationship between &quot;people, animals, and society&quot; two thousand years ago can help us clarify their thinking and clarify the public opinion field. Some views and views above. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>; The distinction between human poultry &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; As a philosophical idea more than 2,000 years ago, the most precious part of the pre -Qin Confucian thought is undoubtedly the ubiquitous humanisticism in principle. This is also very clear in the &quot;dislike of human poultry&quot;. Mencius said: &quot;The creatures of heaven also make one of them.&quot; People are the only subject of moral practice. The heart &quot;and&quot; the heart of the concealment &quot;are part of the&quot; benevolence &quot;. The so -called&quot; hidden heart, the end of the benevolence &quot;,&quot; benevolent &quot;is not only one of the norms of moral practice, but also the highest purpose of moral practice. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; For society, all the appearance of &quot;civilization&quot;, whether it is respect for the elderly and loves the young, protects the grass and trees, and treats animals well. &quot;One of the results generated during the goal process. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; As the master of all things, and the only subject in moral practice, of course, there is the power to treat and dispose of &quot;things&quot; in their own way. Live in life. &quot;The Analects of Confucius&quot; said, &quot;Zi fishing does not outline, and does not shoot the night.&quot; Confucius fishing with a fishing rod, but did not use the net to fish and hunting birds, but did not kill the nest to live. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; There are similar discussions in the Confucian classics of later generations. A gentleman has the ability to capture all the fish in the lake, but only catch the part of the food that you need to eat, and no longer catch it. The gentleman has the power to hunt in the mountains and forests, but he will not shoot the birds at will just because he wants to show his superb shooting or fun. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Fish did not die because of human greed. Flying birds were not killed because of the rise of humans. The &quot;heart&quot; of fish and flying birds practice the result of &quot;benevolence&quot;. The moral foundation of &quot;benevolence&quot; in the relationship between man and beast lies in the moral consciousness of man and the main object of the human and beasts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; This is not a &quot;equivalent right to survive&quot;, which does not mean that &quot;even if humans cannot deprive animals&#39; living rights even if they are suffering from serious potential threats.&quot; In the ridiculous world of &quot;dogs and foods without food, there are hungry and unknown&quot;, &quot;benevolent&quot; cannot talk about it, and the so -called civilization is just a joke. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>; Renmin love &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; In the &quot;dislike of human poultry&quot;, the relationship between humans and beasts is positioned as the relationship between human beings and things, and there is an insurmountable gap between people and things. Therefore, this relationship must be lower than the relationship between people and people. When discussing the relationship between people and people, people, and things, Mencius said: &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; ; Yu Min also, benevolence and relatives. Kissing and benevolent, benevolent and love. &quot;&lt;/P>; &lt;p>; This sentence means that the gentleman treats things no matter how much he likes, and he will not&quot; benevolent &quot; Priority is given to things, and to the people, although it is reluctant, it will not give love for love. The gentleman&#39;s dear relative will love the people, and the people will love everything. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; This logical relationship is the so -called &quot;love is poor, etc.&quot;, &quot;difference, etc.&quot; is a concentric circle, and the heart is self. Townships, Chinese, and outsiders, the outermost layers are treated as the most basic ethics of human beings, and they are &quot;things&quot; outside the outermost layer. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Animals are treated kindly, and the civilization of human society has reached a certain height. After the guarantee, the &quot;love of badness&quot; finally benefited the results of animals, instead of saying that as long as it is protected and treats animals, society is naturally civilized. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; All emotions that violate this logical relationship are false. For example, some people do not love their families and love their country, do not love people and love outsiders, then his love for people and outsiders is also false. It may be some kind of distorted projection of the hate of family members and people. In the same way, some people claim that they love animals than their lover, and they are likely to be some kind of distorted projection. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; So Mencius asked King Liang Hui: &quot;Today is enough to reach the beasts, and those who do not work as the people, Duhe and your own grace can be applied to animals, but they cannot be applied to the people. Why)? &quot;It is a taunt and criticism. This problem can also be used to question those who claim to love animals than their lover. What is their&quot; love &quot;for animals? Is it selfishness? &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>; Love is poor &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; Another focus of controversy in the &quot;Evil Dog injury incident&quot; is that some people who do not raise dogs advocate the formulation and implementation of strict and effective urban dogs. At the same time, stray dogs that thoroughly clean up and kill the public. And some people who raise dogs think that this is too brutal. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The two have a very different understanding of this issue. It is that the two have completely different feelings for animal projection. For the former who do not raise dogs, they have no feelings for dogs. The latter of the dog is much more complicated. Their emotions can easily spread from their dogs to the dogs of others, and from the dog&#39;s dogs to all dogs (including stray dogs). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The border of unknown and controlling emotions, letting it spread is the cognitive characteristics of immatureness (such as children). &quot;Love is poor, etc.&quot; limits the boundary of human emotions, which avoids the spread of unlimited individual emotions to the greatest extent, and hinders the rights and public rights of individual social individuals. All in all, people are the subject. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The reason why Confucianism can be rooted in traditional Chinese society for two thousand years is basically in the human nature and explain to common sense.

All the audience channels are affixed with color paper to maximize blocking the light into the theater. When the stage lights went out, the audience was immersed in a pure darkness. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; This is the &quot;Dark Theater&quot; created by Dao Jel Pomora. During the scene, a cold white light gradually illuminated the outline of the actor on the empty stage. The streets of the two junior high schools were on both sides of the stage on both sides of the stage. One of the boys suspected that the girl was a robot. He kept provocation and instructed his companion to touch the girl&#39;s chest. Finally, the girl ran away with her late partner. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The light turns dark, and when it is on, the scene has been switched to the company. The latest humanoid robot sitting on the sofa can draw, write, speak, and imitate the &quot;space step&quot; -this Family robots used to accompany young people to learn and play, known as Steven, Robbie, or Eddie. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; A series of stories of adolescents, adults and robots have begun. In the eleven situations, in the strong contrast between the lights and the dark field, it suddenly appeared and stopped abruptly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; During the curtain curtain, the audience discovered that except for an actor who played an adult male, the other Qing Yixi was an actress. The average age is about 35 years old, and some of them have become mothers. On the stage, they alternately play boys, girls and robots. They are wearing sports jackets and jeans, chasing, shouting, raising their hands to exude youthfulness; incarnate robots, from the cold faces, flat hair to stiff movements, and a slightly metallic sound, accurate and real. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Director Assistant Lucia &amp; Nbsp; Trotta told the Southern Weekend reporter that &quot;At first, the director did not intend to do a drama about robots. Planting situation. &quot;Fairy Tale Legend&quot; is a story about human rather than artificial intelligence. It continues the perspective of teenagers in Porara&#39;s past creations, and explores major issues such as human emotional relationships, identity, life and death, and sex. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; As a Chinese script translator and the recommender of Wuzhen Drama, Wang Jing agreed to the drama troupe three years ago and finally brought this French drama to China. &quot;The director was collecting a lot of information in the early stage. He found that the high -tech has a great impact on teenagers and children, so he put this thing related to society in. But the focus is still on people. The robot is just a mirror. Reflect some of the contemporary problems, &quot;she told reporters from the southern weekend. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The last segment in the play, the boy who defeated cancer received a great gift on his birthday -his enthusiastic worship and loved robot star Eddie came to his home to celebrate his birthday for 15 minutes. He was intoxicated in the performance of his idol, and he didn&#39;t know that the brokerage company would destroy the robot soon for market considerations. At the end of the show, Eddie sang and danced, &quot;I want to die on the stage, that is where I was born.&quot; The boy hugged another human boy and slowly paced in the music. &lt;/p>; &lt;H4>; &lt;strong>; &quot;Love&quot; with the robot is a mapping of human loneliness &lt;/strong>; &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; &quot;In this world that adults can&#39;t understand, the lost children hold it tightly and grasp it tightly. The signal of love, even if they come from robots, even if they know they are artificial. &quot;French reporter Jean Luke Polkai commented on the show. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; These 11 to 14 -year -old children rely on their robots in life and even emotion, and the intimacy between the two blurred the original emotions and ethical boundaries of human beings. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The boy sitting in a wheelchair witnessed the process of being destroyed by robot partners. The disability of his legs was caused by a robot error when he was playing with the robot at one time. Even if he lost his legs because of each other, the boy still accompanied the robot to spend its last time. The sentences in the robot population were getting more and more broken, the sound became more and more dumb, and the boy held his hand and hugged it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In another story, human teenagers face the removal of robotic partners&#39; memory. Boys need to sell robots who grew up with themselves, because their parents said that at this stage he needed to change to a &quot;more mature&quot; robot, and the economic constraints at home have to be sold to have new ones. The buyer is a woman with a terminally ill. She decided to find a robot and take care of her children and husband after her death. Her son asked the robot to restore the factory settings, and he did not accept the memory of other people&#39;s homes. Such a requirement made the boy stunned, but he &quot;had to grow up&quot;, and eventually he accepted helplessly. To this end, he apologized and said goodbye to the robot. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; There are many absent parents in the play. There are three robots in a boy&#39;s house to accompany him to write homework and watch TV, and he can&#39;t figure out when the busy parents will go home. Another boy ran to the mall selling robots for consultation. The salesperson repeatedly invited his parents to come, and they never appeared. In the middle of the night, the boy secretly stayed in the mall, threw various weird problems to the robot, and enjoyed this communication until he was taken away by the security guard. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Wang Jing lived in France. When he sent his child to the child, the teacher and parents met. The first thing was to tell them not to let the child come into contact with any screen before the age of 3. &quot;France will pay great attention here, because in the process of growing up, the communication between the tablet and the world, and the personality of the creation of the real world and the exchange with nature, the development of his IQ is not the same. Psychological is also different. &quot;&lt;/P>; &lt;p>; In her opinion, Popolra is talking about the problems we face now.比较缺席的，都交给机器人，交给高科技，交给平板，交给手机，探讨的问题是一样的，只不过把它放到极端的情境。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;轮椅男孩的前女友与机器人斯蒂芬建立了亲密关系，一个成年男声提出质疑：这种关系是否真实，又会否因此远离现实生活？女孩朗声道，“在外面，在公交车上，没有多少人会真正在意自己”，而和斯蒂芬一起时，她能感受到它的关注。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;机器人明星艾迪出现，兴奋的少年们尖叫啜泣，他们为他能记住自己的名字、做过的事而狂喜。艾迪是最完美、称职的偶像，每一个粉丝的名字，每一次相遇，都印刻在他的记忆中，每一封信件，都得到他贴心的回复。在患癌的男孩心中，他俨然已经是信仰般的存在，支撑他坚强地活下去。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“我觉得它会进入到人很脆弱的部分。”王婧对南方周末记者说，“青少年的不被理解，AI给的心理补偿和我们的孤独感，都有。而且人工智能有时候比真实人类给出的回应更好。”看完戏，不止一个观众写下相似的短评，“比起没有关系或者不好的关系，假的关系要更好吗？”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/14/YjzKZL0s0AIuAiLLqZQZRa6GkhvP3ME8tO3FvavB.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/14/YjzKZL0s0AIuAiLLqZQZRa6GkhvP3ME8tO3FvavB.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;258241&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;除了一位饰演成年男性的男演员，其他清一色是女演员。她们平均年龄35岁左右，部分已经当了妈妈，在舞台上，她们交替扮演男孩、女孩和机器人。 &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（受访者图/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;不寒而栗的青春期&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;灯光亮起，一个穿着白色连衣裙、骂骂咧咧的男孩从黑暗中出现。他的母亲进了精神病院，他穿着她的裙子，狼狈不堪地教训弟弟妹妹睡觉。当父亲想把小的孩子们送到义工处时，他决定自己承担起家中母亲的角色，对于父亲的选择，他怒不可遏地指斥。然而，观众会看到，他让一个13岁女孩怀孕后，女孩打电话来沟通，他粗暴地挂掉电话，继续收拾家中的残局。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“他一方面想承担成人世界他母亲的责任，但同时又把自己的责任抛掉。你就会发现人性的多面性，和青春期的纠结、复杂性和不确定性。”王婧在翻译剧本时，被波默拉对于年轻人、家庭关系的观察打动，尤其在舞台上展现这些时，他不做评判，只是呈现各种可能性。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一幅当代社会的青春期图景，以克制而锐利的方式得到呈现。在21世纪，青少年成长过于迅速，面对成人问题的速度加快，本应属于他们的天真幼稚、无忧无虑更早褪去了。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;两家法国媒体都以“不寒而栗”形容《童话传奇》带来的观感。青春期的躁动与戾气不时搅动剧场里平静的气氛。少年们用清澈的嗓音喷出大量粗俗的谩骂。性、婚恋、暴力、死亡、身份认同，围绕这些大问题的讨论，并不因主角是孩子而有所遮掩。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;从第一个场景开始，在女孩男孩的对抗中，性别问题便已出现，这一青春期的关键主题贯穿了整部戏。 《童话传奇》的性别观念走得更远，背后指向的是，性别认同是否如性别理论所主张的，只是一种缓慢的社会建构？ &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;于是观众会看见一些暧昧的景象。为了逃过女孩哥哥的监视，男孩换上女装，女孩虽然惊讶，但很快坦然接受。坐在沙发上的这一对，超越了与异装有关的刻板印象与偏见，顺利谈起了恋爱。而另一边，哥哥面对之前爱慕的、外貌从女孩转换成男孩的机器人，在浪漫的音乐中晃了神。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;戏中还假设，在未来世界，父权价值观受到热烈的捍卫，人们厌恶同性恋，处于青春期的男孩们参加训练营，增强自己的男子气概。开营前，教练发表演讲：“今天，我们敌人的目标甚至不再是男女平等，而是社会的整体女性化。如果我们不采取一切可能的手段进行斗争，如果我们不采取任何措施来保护我们真正的人性，那么这些原则将塑造我们的未来。”这段“口头激素”刺激了“缺乏男子气概”的男孩们，在这里，他们将女性化视为敌人。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;男孩卡米耶拥有偏女性化的名字与温柔的气质，在训练营里格格不入。除了他，所有男孩都通过了压力训练——面对其他人从对面投来的否定和恶意凝视，能报以强硬的对视。男孩们不屑与他为伍，甚至群起而攻之。最后卡米耶愤怒地哭着说，自己只是不想要战争。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;演员露西·格林施泰因（Lucid&amp;nbsp;Grunstein）在戏中扮演卡米耶，她告诉南方周末记者，“一群人排斥一个人，这让我感到不安。”对她来说，这场戏很重。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;“舞台创作”与“黑暗剧场”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;男性气概训练营的群戏，是演男孩的女演员们演得最过瘾的一场戏。谩骂、吼叫、围拢、推搡，哪怕在一段看不见演员的漆黑里，台上依然像炸了锅般喧嚷。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;她们释放了自己对于青春期男孩所有的观察与想象，没有自身性别的束缚，她们感到拥有了特别大的自由度。排练时，她们的表演甚至走得太远，波默拉不得不把她们拉回来一些。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;路易·雾霭剧团的集体创作方式，给了演员极大的创作自由。在完成大量的资料收集之后，波默拉带着这些基础素材，和团队一起做即兴创作。没有提前写好的剧本，他只会给出一个情境，比如男孩要售卖他的机器人。演员即兴的表演如白纸生花，故事的方向、情节逐渐长出，再到台词、动作等细节。波默拉会让演员之间互换角色，比如演机器人的演员，去演一下卖机器人的男孩，以此激发演员充分理解每个角色背后的东西，寻找更多的可能性。演员们非常深入创作，“我们扮演的每个角色都有我们自己的影子，同时这个角色在我们身上也打上了这个角色的烙印”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;故事文本生成的过程，与布景、灯光、声音等舞台设计交织在一起。这种“舞台创作”是波默拉独特的工作方式。他喜欢自称“戏剧创作”而非“导演”或“编剧”，不希望大家认为编剧和导演是两个分工。在他的创作里，舞台和文本同步产生，根据演员的排练来调整，这与先有剧本和导演意向再去排练的传统戏剧创作大相径庭。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“黑暗剧场”是波默拉与剧团的另一个独创之处。他们善用黑暗于视觉与心理上的呼应，让叙述的力量更为凝聚、饱满，与“少即是多”的舞台风格、含蓄而精确的灯光运用，共同构成其剧场的独特气质。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“一个场景突然在你面前亮起来。然后它用的光线都压得比较暗，不太像有的时候我们会看到演出各种各样的灯亮，给你感官刺激。它可能进入的是比较细微的层面，细节的、很精准的地方，但是它同时很浓烈、很强烈。”王婧说。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;波默拉在剧团名字里安放了自己的期望。路易来源于他父亲的名字，亦有光明之意，雾霭则象征他对未知世界的探寻，也代表他的戏剧美学追求。他的作品强调世界不是非黑即白，人性也并非善恶分明，复杂多元的情境里，观众只是感受和体验到不同的存在方式和真理的模糊性。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;成立33年来，路易·雾霭剧团已创作并巡演34出剧目，上演4000余场。 2019年，路易·雾霭剧团的《小红帽》在北京天桥艺术中心上演，是波默拉的作品首次来到中国内地演出。时隔四年，《童话传奇》作为闭幕大戏来到了乌镇戏剧节。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;演出结束后，有中国观众询问未来是否会在国内巡演。王婧表示，这种可能微乎其微。首先是档期原因，剧团每年在各国巡演数百场，需要至少提前两年预约；其次是作品对于舞台技术要求高，一般剧场很难做到；再次是波默拉对于舞台呈现有极高要求。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;王婧回忆：“这个戏一开始能不能来乌镇，我们是提前跟技术团队开过会的。法国的技术总监非常明确，如果保证不了他们就没有办法来，因为他们不希望表演被削减。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;剧场不能超过450人，波默拉拒绝在上千人的大剧场演出，“导演特别在意观众，需要第一排和最后一排的观众都能够看清楚。”王婧对南方周末记者解释，“我们中国很多的剧院还是在盈利的基础之上，不到一千人、两千人，回不了本。”&lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;从现场视频看，当事女子驾车追尾，现场执勤的交警看到当事女子“脸都红了”，要求其下车接受酒精测试。当事女子回应称“我喝酒不脸红”。交警正常执法要求当事女子接受呼气测试，得到的是“我要告你猥亵”的回答。而在交警表示“你作为公民（需要配合执法）”时，当事女子干脆来了一句“我不是公民，不吹了”，随后要靠强制执行才完成血样测试。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;本案案情并不复杂，基本事实也一清如水。但仍有不少值得深入讨论之处。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;其一，从本案案情来看，当事女子除了涉嫌危险驾驶罪之外，还涉嫌其他违法犯罪行为。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当事女子血液中的酒精含量已经超过80mg/100ml的标准，属于醉酒驾驶，其行为同时违反了《中华人民共和国道路交通安全法》与《中华人民共和国刑法》。根据道路交通安全法第91条，醉酒驾驶机动车的，由公安机关交通管理部门约束至酒醒，吊销机动车驾驶证，依法追究刑事责任；五年内不得重新取得机动车驾驶证；而根据刑法第133条，在道路上醉酒驾驶机动车的，处拘役，并处罚金。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;如果当事女子仅仅是醉酒驾驶而且仅仅追尾的话，那么对她的处罚可能也就仅限于吊销驾照、拘役与罚金，同时赔偿前车车主的损失。问题在于，当事女子现场的其他行为也涉嫌违法犯罪。她的一句“我要告你猥亵”，这是在公共场合针对个人进行公开指控，那么就必须要为指控的真实性负责。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;视频画面清楚地显示，执勤交警是在正常执法，合理怀疑追尾车主有酒驾嫌疑，要求其接受酒精检查，完全是在履行公务。根据《交通警察道路执勤执法工作规范》附件《查处酒后驾驶操作规程》，执勤交警有权“对有酒后驾驶嫌疑的机动车驾驶人，要求其下车接受酒精检验”。因此，当事女子的公开指控是不折不扣的虚假指控，应当承担起相应的法律责任。往小了说这是在污蔑诽谤，往大了说这甚至是诬告陷害，因为当事女子还表示“我要告你”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;《中华人民共和国治安管理处罚法》第四十二条规定，“公然侮辱他人或者捏造事实诽谤他人的”“捏造事实诬告陷害他人，企图使他人受到刑事追究或者受到治安管理处罚的”是违法行为，应予以拘留并罚款的处罚。刑法第243条也规定，捏造事实诬告陷害他人，意图使他人受刑事追究，构成诬告陷害罪。情节严重的，处三年以下有期徒刑、拘役或者管制，造成严重后果的处三年以上十年以下徒刑。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;其二，这起案件的背后呈现出的社会现象更令人忧虑，那就是一些人利用特定身份与话术，绕开明规则为自己寻求特权的“玩法”行为。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当事女子条件反射般的“告你猥亵”，足见类似思维定式已经深入骨髓，那就是利用诬告话术实施威胁，绕开明规则为自己寻求不受惩罚的特权。现实中的“性侵诬告”“强奸诬告”“网络小作文”带来的“灵感”，恐怕早就内化为当事人的行事思维，这种思维背后的定式足以令人齿冷：只要先把事情“闹大”指控对方，那么进可以敲诈勒索，退可以脱罪卸责。而即便话术失灵，也不会遭受什么惩罚。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;更值得忧虑的是，如果本案中没有视频画面作证的话，是否当事女子就可以一口咬定是交警猥亵，然后反诉执勤交警？当事女子是否可以以此要挟执勤交警，为自己谋取脱罪的好处？仿佛只要这么一闹，他人乃至公权力都要“让着我”，这是对正义的践踏。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;其三，更为严重的是，当事女子虚假指控的对象是国家公职人员，这是公然挑战民警的执法权威。根据《公安机关维护民警执法权威工作规定》第8条，民警在依法履行职责、行使职权过程中或者因依法履行职责、行使职权遇到“本人及其近亲属受到威胁、恐吓、侮辱、诽谤、骚扰的”情形，公安机关应当积极维护民警执法权威。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;因此，如若不严肃处理当事女子、追究其危险驾驶罪之外的其他违法犯罪行为的话，势必给类似行为带来负面激励，刺激更多的不法之辈如法炮制，乃至继续实施诬告，为民警的正常执法制造障碍，这绝非公共利益之福。本案仍在调查处理之中，理应还当值民警一个公道，威慑企图起而效尤的人。&lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;&lt;span>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;2023&lt;/span>;年11月12日，合盛硅业（603260.SH）原总经理方红承妻子通过网络实名举报：合盛硅业董事长罗立国以搬迁上市企业为由，&lt;span>;要挟浙江嘉兴市政府干预司法&lt;/span>;，将方红承构陷入狱。 &lt;span>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;方红承于2009年加盟合盛硅业，自2011年4月起任该公司总经理，2018年12月离职。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;其妻称，方红承&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;离职后&lt;/span>;，罗立国拒绝履行双方股权约定&lt;span>;，并对嘉兴市政府施压，导致方红承与其弟方红兴被捕并羁押&lt;/span>;17个月至今。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;次日一早，合盛硅业发出澄清公告，披露方红承涉嫌非国家工作人员受贿罪、职务侵占罪一案，将于当天在平湖市人民法院开庭审理。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;公司官网显示，合盛硅业由宁波合盛集团于2005年投资成立，2017年在上交所主板上市，是全球最完整的硅基全产业链公司，也是业内唯一同时具备工业硅、有机硅、多晶硅、光伏组件等生产能力的高新技术企业，在浙江、新疆、云南、四川、黑龙江等地有生产基地。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;合盛硅业2023年三季报显示，罗立国家族是合盛硅业实控人，罗立国及其子女合计持有上市公司约78.59%的股权。据2023年胡润百富榜，罗立国家族以600亿元财富位列第66名。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;代表方红承对外发声的是其表弟童建彭，他告诉南方周末记者，方红承的案件并未在11月13日如期开庭，而是进行了全天的庭前会议。 11月14日仍是庭前会议，开庭时间尚不确定。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;11月14日、15日上午，方红承家属分别向嘉兴市中级人民法院和浙江省高级人民法院提出异地管辖申请，希望将该案移送至嘉兴以外的人民法院审理。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这场实名举报风波背后，究竟发生了什么？ &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;被刑案打断的股权官司&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;方红承和罗立国的矛盾，源于近年来两起股权纠纷。方红承在案件一审中均获部分支持。南方周末记者获得了相关裁判文书。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2015年9月，方红承与合盛硅业及其员工持股平台宁波英融企业管理咨询有限公司（下称宁波英融）签订《股权激励协议》，约定方红承以278.6万元的价格受让宁波英融5%的股权，从而间接持有合盛硅业30万股。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;同时，《股权激励协议》还约定，方红承需要在获得股权激励后继续在合盛硅业服务5年，且期间不从事同业竞争业务&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;、&lt;/span>;不得损害公司利益，否则将被追究相关法律责任。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2017年10月30日，该公司以19.52元/股的发行价上市后，一路涨至252.79元/股，公司市值突破2600亿元。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2018年，合盛硅业年度权益分派决定，每股转增股份0.4股，方红承在合盛硅业的持股因此增至42万股。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当年12月，方红承从合盛硅业离职。方红承在一篇自述中称，其离职后开始创业，在2019年分别成立了由他控股且与合盛硅业无竞业关系的浙江香林新材料有限公司和浙江赢科新材料股份有限公司。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2021年4月30日，方红承起诉宁波英融，合盛硅业为第三人。方称其持股禁售期已过，请求按协议支付激励股权兑现收益，并补齐2018-2020年间未支付的年度分红款。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;浙江省平湖市人民法院一审查明，上述三方还在2018年签订了一份《补充协议》，明确方红承同意减少其持股的25%，以缴纳税费及其它费用.加上2018年的分红派股，方红承持有合盛硅业共计31.5万股。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;此外，平湖法院认为竞业限制条款并非激励股权的取得条件，而是取得股权后的应尽义务，原告方红承未尽相应义务应承担法律责任，而非丧失激励股权。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;2022&lt;/span>;年3月28日，平湖法院一审支持方红承的部分请诉，判宁波英融将其所持的31.5万股合盛硅业A股股票卖出，扣除交易费用后还给方红承，并支付后者14.76万元股票分红。宁波英融随后提出上诉。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但在嘉兴市中级人民法院二审过程中，方红承因涉嫌职务侵占被采取刑事强制措施。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;嘉兴中院认为应驳回方红承的起诉，并将有关材料移送公安机关，若经公安机关审查后认为本案确属民事纠纷的，方红承可另行主张权利。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2022年11月29日，嘉兴中院裁定，撤销平湖法院的一审判决，驳回方红承的起诉。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;违规代持&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;另一起股权纠纷，直接发生在方红承与罗立国之间。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2017年1月1日，方红承与罗立国签订《股权转让协议》，约定将后者间接持有的合盛硅业126.11万股的股权（占上市前总股本0.21%），以3.17元/股的价格转让给方红承。且方红承自愿承诺，协议签订后服务罗立国实控公司至少5年，其间不从事同业竞争业务。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;同一日，两者还签订了《代持股权协议书》，由罗立国为方红承代持上述股份。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;方红承家属提供给南方周末记者的材料显示，合盛硅业于2011年开始启动上市工作，方红承任上市工作小组组长。 2017年春节后，&lt;span>;或是因为对方红承工作的肯定&lt;/span>;，或是担心其跳槽，罗立国提出，方红承用自己的年终奖，以公司净资产价格受让罗名下少量股权，并由罗代持。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;根据裁判文书，2017年12月14日，方红承与罗立国又签订了新的《&lt;span>;股权转让及代持协议&lt;/span>;》，约定方红承以50元/股出让之前受让的26.11万股，总作价1305.5万元。本次转让后，方红承仍间接持有100万股合盛硅业股份，由罗立国代持。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;方红承认为，其共计间接持有140万股合盛硅业股份。因为在上述100万股的基础上，其还持有2018年合盛硅业分派的每股转增股份0.4股。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;2021&lt;/span>;年4月25日，方红承就此股权转让纠纷向杭州仲裁委员会申请仲裁，要求罗立国出售140万股，&lt;span>;并将所得及相关股份&lt;/span>;2018、2019年的分红支付给自己。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;监管一贯对上市公司的股权代持问题态度严厉&lt;/span>;。杭州仲裁委援引证券法和《上市公司信息披露管理办法》，认定方红承和罗立国关于代持股份的约定无效，但其他条款仍然有效。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;杭州仲裁委认为，双方约定方红承于2017年1月1日起全职勤勉服务罗立国实控公司至少5年，但方红承在2018年12月7日辞职，只履行了40%的服务期承诺，所以可相应获得34.0676万股合盛硅业股份及部分2018-2020年分红款。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2022年2月23日，杭州仲裁委裁决，罗立国将34.0676万股合盛硅业股份减持变现后扣除交易费用，连同37.67万元分红一起支付给方红承。罗立国也提出了上诉。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;罗立国在上诉中称，方红承违反竞业限制约定，如其从合盛硅业离职当月即入职同行业公司新亚强（603155.SH）任副总经理，持281万股。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;方红承确实曾试图这么做。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;新亚强招股书显示，该公司于2018年12月20日与方红承签订劳动合同，约定在满足任职条件的情况下聘任方红承为公司副总经理。此约定在6日后的股东大会上审议通过，方红承获授激励股份281万股，以自有资金出资。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但由于方红承未能提供满足副总经理任职条件的相关文件，其自愿申请并经新亚强同意，在2018年12月30日终止了双方的劳动合同，方红承自愿转出其持有的新亚强股份。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2022年5月23日，杭州市中级人民法院驳回了罗立国撤销仲裁裁决的申请。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;合盛硅业在澄清公告中称，该裁决目前处于执行阶段，罗立国已向法院提出不予执行仲裁裁决的申请，法院尚在审理中。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;方红承在上述两起纠纷中均获部分支持，按合盛硅业当时的股价估算，方红承最多能获利8100余万元。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;牵出危废处理隐患&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;2022年11月22日，合盛硅业公告称，公司原董事、总经理方红承因涉嫌职务侵占已由公安机关侦查终结并移送至检察机关审查起诉，其所涉犯罪行为发生在公司任职期间。该案件为公司内部自查发现并向公安机关报案。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;此事牵出合盛硅业危废品处理隐患。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;根据相关研究论文，在有机硅生产中，沸点低于40℃的副产物组成的混合物称为低沸物，其中大部分是四甲基硅烷，还有二甲基一氯硅烷、三氯硅烷、氯甲烷等。低沸物组分间沸点很接近，所以很难分离加以利用。这些化合物易燃易爆。其中，四甲基硅烷被列入国家《危险化学品名录》。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;合盛硅业招股书和2023年半年报均披露，副产品低沸物是该公司主要的固废，严格执行外售处理。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;据方红承的自述及其家属提供的材料，2011年，合盛硅业内外交困，急需进行技术改造、降低成本。因危险化学品生产技术改造涉及政府审批，罗立国决定所有新建、改建项目大干快上，和政策抢时间。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;方红承列出了8个当时违规新建、改建的项目，都是未按规定办理安评、环评等相关审批手续，大多数项目的直接经济效益都在1000万元/年above.项目之一是在密闭系统中，对被定性为危废的低沸物进行相对安全地处置，将其变为相对稳定的“水解油”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;上述材料称，“水解油”是合盛硅业自己的命名，是低沸物和水反应转化成的一种腐蚀性较小、成分复杂、易燃易爆的油状危险化学Taste.合盛硅业仍需将“水解油”及时对外处置，否则会导致公司停产。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这项工作落到了方红承弟弟方红兴头上，“方红兴冒着违法违规，安全环保风险，与他人合作处置利用&#39;水解油&#39;并获取利益。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2019年4月，方红承成立了生产特种有机硅涂料的轻资产公司浙江香林新材料有限公司。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;上述材料显示，次月，合盛硅业将方红兴帮助其销售处置“水解油”的事，以罗立国不知情，方红承擅自建设等为由，指控方红承“背信损害上市公司利益”，向嘉兴港区公安分局报案。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在方红承就两起股权纠纷提起诉讼和仲裁后，2021年8月，合盛硅业以方红承涉嫌非国家工作人员受贿，第二次到港区公安分局报案。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;方红承家属举报信中附上了港区公安分局2021年12月31日作出的撤销案件决定书，称方红承涉嫌非国家工作人员受贿案没有犯罪事实，案件撤销。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;事实上，方红承和罗立国在股权纠纷诉讼中，已对“水解油”的处置问题争过几个来回。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;罗立国以一组销售合同和评估报告为证，指控方红承在职期间以不到2000元/吨的价格“贱卖”评估价格每吨越过万元的“水解油”，为其关联公司谋取巨额利益。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;方红承则以邮件往来及报表为据称，其对“水解油”的生产、销售只是遵照罗立国及其他公司高层的决策执行，不是个人谋利行为。且“水解油”的生产销售活动不合法、不合规，本身不会为合盛硅业带来任何合法利益。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但法院的审理重点在两者的股权纠纷上，并未对“水解油”问题进行判决。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;公司不再搬迁&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;到了2022年6月，方红承才被港区公安分局立案。其在自述中表示，6月13日方红承兄弟俩被传唤，第二日被指定居所“监视居住”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;方红承及其家属认为，事件的变化是因罗立国以将上市公司从嘉兴市搬离至宁波市代管的县级市慈溪为由，要挟嘉兴市政府所To. 2018年嘉兴市委有关部门的相关文章显示，合盛硅业是嘉兴港区培育的首家上市公司。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;合盛硅业在澄清公告中表示，公司注册地址在嘉兴，但嘉兴生产基地以化工生产设施为主，办公条件有限，所以在2022年1月公告将办公地址更改至宁波慈溪。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;据《宁波晚报》，罗立国出生在“草帽之乡”慈溪长河镇，靠开草帽厂起家，有慈溪首富之称。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;根据澄清公告，为统一办公地址与注册地址，公司召开第三届董事会第十二次会议，拟变更公司地址至慈溪。后为维持相关资质登记，公司终止执行变更公司住所并取消审议该事项的股东大会。这两件事项分别在2022年5月28日和6月8日公告。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;2023&lt;/span>;年5月，方红承家属向嘉兴港区应急管理局、嘉兴市应急管理局及四川省应急管理厅实名举报合盛硅业违法建设低沸水解装置，非法销售危险化学品方面的问题，获得了不同的回复&lt;span>;。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;据举报信，嘉兴港区应急管理局分三次回复称，未在现场发现水解装置，低沸物可以作为副产物销售，“水解油”未在危化品目录。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;四川省应急管理厅则称，“水解油”系危险化学品，且未在合盛硅业（泸州）有限公司的安全生产许可范围，已责令该公司暂停使用“水解油”生产装置，并对该公司涉嫌安全生产违法行为进行调查。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;合盛硅业对“水解油”情况澄清称，其嘉兴子公司合盛硅业（嘉兴）有限公司已办理的《危险化学品登记品种》包括低沸油（即“水解油”）。其泸州子公司合盛硅业（泸州）有限公司已办理的《危险化学品登记品种》也包括含氢硅油S。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;据企查查，合盛硅业（嘉兴）有限公司设立于2020年6月29日。这意味着，合盛硅业并未回应方红承在职期间，是如何处置低沸物的。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;获取更多RSS：&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot;
