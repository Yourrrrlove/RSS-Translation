There are three great creation gods in their folklore. In addition to the Thunder King and the Dragon King, there is also the old man Buluotuo who knows all things. In addition, the worship of nature has also derived many objects that can be sacrificed, such as mountain gods and land gods. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/1iVkwdpPF7uR7KbJCyujFW4UrAg8u1HXgC9756tT.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/1iVkwdpPF7uR7KbJCyujFW4UrAg8u1HXgC9756tT.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;257434&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Firecracker competition on April 10, 2011, Baiyu Town, Tianyang County, Guangxi&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Xie Peixia/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt; /p>; &lt;p>;In order to worship the gods, people gathered together to perform ritual songs and dances. With the development of the times, the original sacrificial singing and dancing gradually turned into a group singing fair activity. During March and April of the lunar calendar, or between August and September, when the weather is suitable in spring and autumn, people put down their farm work and sing in open places. Young men and women use singing to choose their spouses, and middle-aged and elderly people compete with each other and enjoy songs. Everyone and every family can enjoy the song fair, and the large-scale national event has shifted from &quot;entertaining gods&quot; to &quot;entertaining people&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/GDYjtAsOE2zGApnmHjnfaJ4JE5nRHMctRyY5jdT2.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/GDYjtAsOE2zGApnmHjnfaJ4JE5nRHMctRyY5jdT2.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;257436&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Stilt walking competition on April 28, 2014, Yiwei Town, Tiandong County, Guangxi &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Xie Peixia/Photo)&lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Song fairs are generally popular in Zhuang areas. In 1983, the People&#39;s Government of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region made a decision to designate the third day of the third lunar month as the Zhuang Song Festival. However, in Tiandong, Tianyang and other places in Baise City, there were dozens or even hundreds of song fairs a year at their peak. In recent years, due to young people going out to work, the number of song fairs has gradually decreased. In some areas, after the old singers quit, there are no young and middle-aged singers to take over, and the song fairs can only be suspended. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/0FCrEwFra4rmiU3HYTcLRlG1AzO0FG0iiSntiKPu.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/0FCrEwFra4rmiU3HYTcLRlG1AzO0FG0iiSntiKPu.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;257445&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Wrestling match on Little Tomatoes, April 4, 2017, Baiyu Town, Tianyang County, Guangxi&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Xie Peixia/Picture)&lt;/ span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;How to make the song fair continue better in the present? Tiandong County, Baise City, advocates &quot;one town, one section&quot; in 10 towns in the county. This time, the festival shifted from celebrating broad festivals to focusing on its own life. The song fair is not only for singing folk songs, but also for various folk entertainment activities, such as throwing hydrangeas, touching Easter eggs, grabbing fireworks, etc. Competitiveness is secondary, but more importantly, it is interesting and attracts participation. It allows towns and villages to discover their own special activities and stimulates people&#39;s enthusiasm for participation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/VthFdlQoy2VQMB9yYQIoHT6aU7PDl1PemJtLI3Hl.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/VthFdlQoy2VQMB9yYQIoHT6aU7PDl1PemJtLI3Hl.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;257443&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Bare-hand corn shucking competition on March 11, 2012, Naman Town, Tianyang County, Guangxi&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Xie Peixia/Photo)&lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yiwei Town is rich in fragrant pigs. Since 2014, the town has held fragrant pig races at the Gewei in the third month of the lunar calendar. The fragrant pig runs in front, and the owner leads it behind with a rope. The pigs just ran, but the people were much more excited. The audience&#39;s shouts and laughter flooded the whole street. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tiandong County is the hometown of mangoes in China. Xiangzhou Town, where large-scale mango planting is carried out, came up with a mango-themed competition. Women used spoons to hold the mangoes, transport them back and forth, and first remove all the mangoes in the baskets. The one who reaches the finish line wins. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/AiLlc8Dxd1Dsn9JkuwvuFGbBLYfoMQktFnwZB7qu.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/AiLlc8Dxd1Dsn9JkuwvuFGbBLYfoMQktFnwZB7qu.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;257437&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Gyro playing competition on March 17, 2014, Lihu Yao Township, Nandan County, Guangxi&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Xie Peixia/Photo)&lt;/span >;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some towns use small tomatoes as their main crops and hold tomato picking competitions. The couple picks tomatoes in a relay, and the one with the shortest time wins. The most beautiful scene is the wrestling on Little Tomato. The wrestling pool is filled with small tomatoes, and the wrestlers compete with each other. If they are not careful, they will slip on the small tomatoes and be covered in red juice. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/QMw69502wrbjPndaL0P4PMLBXEo5BZF2gqd9B7Hj.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/QMw69502wrbjPndaL0P4PMLBXEo5BZF2gqd9B7Hj.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;257444&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Nose sticking competition February 8, 2016, Pingma Town, Tiandong County, Guangxi&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Xie Peixia/Photo)&lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Behind the transformation of the song fair is the revitalization of rural industries. In the past, there was no industry in the village, and people left their hometowns to work. When song fairs returned along with the industry, young people returned to their hometowns. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/SxEUJDkgni4wP7RSZqJbhhSuKLoaDGFs9UHaZaev.jpg&quot;

Zhang Longji, the principal of a primary school in Jingning County, Pingliang City, was shown raping and molesting many students in public. He was executed on November 7. On November 11, local government office staff confirmed to Nandu reporters that this notice was indeed issued by the Pingliang Intermediate People&#39;s Court, which had previously heard the case. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/11/3b8ad1bc0bbb52159853539a5c14831e.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;1135&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/11/3b8ad1bc0bbb52159853539a5c14831e.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;257973&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Court Notice. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the announcement of Pingliang Intermediate Court, Zhang Longji, male, Han nationality, was born on February 24, 1979 in Jingning County, Gansu Province, with a university education. From 2010 to June 2019, when he served as the dean, principal and teacher of a primary school in Jingning County, he used corporal punishment and other means to form a mental coercion on primary school students who lacked sexual defense ability. He used opportunities such as explaining exercises and students to hand in homework to He repeatedly raped five young girls aged 8 to 12 in his dormitory, and molested 17 children aged 8 to 14 in public in the classroom or in his dormitory.

He was punished for several crimes and decided to execute him and be deprived of political rights for life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the verdict of the case was pronounced, Zhang Longji appealed, but the appeal was rejected by the Gansu Provincial Higher People&#39;s Court and the original death sentence was upheld, which was approved by the Supreme People&#39;s Court. On November 7 this year, Pingliang Intermediate People&#39;s Court followed the execution order issued by the President of the Supreme People&#39;s Court, identified Zhang Longji, took him to the execution ground, and executed him by injection. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Nandu reporters learned that Article 236 of the &quot;Criminal Law&quot; stipulates that anyone who rapes a girl under the age of fourteen shall be treated as rape and shall be severely punished.

On the contrary, Li Taijiang cares deeply about Wen Jing. No matter in terms of attitude or treatment, no one can find any fault. The same goes for Wen Jing.

She thought that after destroying the evidence, she would be ushered in a new life, but what she didn&#39;t know was that her son was hiding inside. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The title &quot;Plastic Greenhouse&quot; is very meaningful. On the surface, it points to the plastic greenhouse in the wasteland where Wen Jing ended up, but its deeper meaning is a mixture of Wen Jing&#39;s kindness and evil, her tragedy and the death she caused. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/11/fc74edd0909394f1dafc9bf6d83a9c30.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;446&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/11/fc74edd0909394f1dafc9bf6d83a9c30.png&quot; data-key=&quot;257931&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The first feature film The curtain is a plastic greenhouse in the dusk, like a huge coffin, making people unable to breathe.

This becomes the question that detective Wu Youzhen keeps searching for in the second half of the film. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From the school where she graduated to the company where she worked, from her native family to the social environment, Wu Youzhen discovered that it was not a certain person who &quot;killed&quot; So Hee, but the entire Korean society. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/11/7ca121b2f95e1fa4be552b9b0d8e0e08.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/11/7ca121b2f95e1fa4be552b9b0d8e0e08.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;257934&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;《Plastic Greenhouse &quot;In &quot;Chun Nan&quot;, a mentally retarded girl was abandoned by her mother since she was a child.

She later joked that maybe she had been closely associated with the word &quot;revolution&quot; since she was born, so she has been interested in the Chinese revolution throughout her life. &quot;Without the revolution, I would probably have grown up in China. I have always been curious about the Chinese revolution, and wanted to know why the revolution happened and what consequences it would bring to China.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Pei Yili also spent his youth in China. She survived the surging global &quot;revolutionary&quot; wave of the left-wing movement, which further strengthened her future academic ambitions. After China&#39;s door opened, she became one of the first foreign scholars allowed to enter China for fieldwork and research. Her research interests mainly focus on modern popular resistance and grassroots politics, spanning the fields of political science and history.

She once served as the director of the Fairbank Research Center at Harvard University and the president of the Association for Asian Studies. Since 2008, she has served as the president of the Harvard-Yenching Institute, cultivating a group of outstanding students and scholars for China studies. Our interview took place in the office of the Harvard-Yenching Institute. The office is small, and the black-and-white photos that mark important moments of this academic institution in the past century hung on the wall exude a deep sense of history. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Since I became president, I have spent half of my time at Harvard-Yenching Institute and the other half as a professor at Harvard.” Pei Yili is still active in teaching, every Wednesday at 1:30 p.m. At 3:30, she is open to students. Each student had to make an appointment with her in advance and explain their questions succinctly. After learning that she had given me more than three hours of interview time, her students all expressed their envy that I had such a &quot;luxury&quot; opportunity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Pei Yili has a hearty personality and is quick to talk. During the interview, he burst out laughing from time to time. Even if he fell into a gloomy look when recalling the twists and turns of his family&#39;s experiences, he would immediately ignore this emotion. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;China has undergone too many changes in the past hundred years.

Her father, Charles Perry - Pei Yili later learned that his Chinese name was Pan Xuesi - had studied Chinese and Japanese at Harvard University in his early years and had a special liking for East Asia. In 1931, Pan Xuesi traveled across the ocean and arrived in Shanghai to teach at St. John&#39;s University. St. John&#39;s University was founded in 1879, formerly known as St. John&#39;s College. It is sponsored by the Episcopal Church in the United States and is the earliest church university in China. After the September 18th Incident broke out, Pan Xuesi made a special trip to Northeast China. &quot;He also wrote a very interesting diary about his travel experience in Manchuria.

So they boarded the ship from Nagasaki back to Shanghai as originally planned.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Pei Yili said that his father liked water sports when he was young and was very fond of boats. The performance is very clear. Not long after their ship left Japanese port, my father became acutely aware that something was not quite right. He said to his wife: &quot;Strange, why is the waterline of the ship so low?&quot; He ran to the bottom cabin to find out what was going on, and found that the bottom was full of Japanese soldiers with live ammunition. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;很显然，裴宜理父母当年见到的这些士兵，就是淞沪会战打响之后从日本增援而来的兵团——他们无意之间成了历史的见证人。这些与他们同船的士兵一到上海就投入到侵华战争中，成为残暴机器中的一环。而等待这对蜜月旅行归来的年轻夫妻的，是被战火燃烧的上海。 “母亲后来回忆，当船进入上海时，她已经闻到那种到处都是死人的味道，这是她从未经历过的……”父母回到他们在圣约翰大学的居所，发现他们结婚的小教堂已经被日军袭击，家里也被洗劫，所有的结婚礼物全部都日本士兵偷走。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;迫于时局，母亲带着出生不久的儿子离开上海回到美国暂避一段时间，父亲则选择留守在圣约翰大学。 1941年“珍珠港事件”爆发，日军进占租界，上海全面沦陷。圣约翰大学的外籍教师除了已经回国的，其余都被关进集中营，其中就有裴宜理的父亲。直到两年后美日政府交换在押人员，他才被释放回美国。祖母到纽约港口接他时，已经认不出瘦骨嶙峋的儿子。但是没过多久，潘学思希望能再次回到中国。 “在美国海军的帮助下，他如愿回到中国，帮助国民政府一起对抗日本人。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;1945年，二战结束，母亲也回到中国。对这个家庭来说，这是他们在中国一段短暂的安宁时光——1948年9月，出生在上海的裴宜理便是这段生活的结晶。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;1949年，中共革命已到决定性时刻，“母亲带着我和两个哥哥先离开了中国，而父亲再一次想留下来。”几个月后，局势更加动荡。潘学思无奈之下告别了他断断续续生活了18年的国家。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;回到美国后，潘学思回到他曾经就读的大学教了几年书，但遥远的东方一直是他念念不忘的地方。 1951年，他们举家搬到东京，潘学思在圣公会创办的日本立教大学教书。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;1959年感恩节的晚上，全家人正围坐在一起吃饭，庆祝美国的传统节日。突然，他们听到院子里的狗不断地叫。父亲出去查看，没想到一场意外不期而至。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“两个年轻的日本学生喝醉了闯进来，他们都练过空手道……只用了几分钟，就把我父亲打死了……并不是有计划来袭击我父亲的，他们当时完全处于醉酒状态，也不知道我父亲是谁。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这位一生对东方抱有浓厚兴趣和关切的美国人，就这样以悲痛的方式结束了他的一生。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;父亲死后，母亲用她对世界的理解来处理这桩悲剧——尽管她的处理方式或许不能被大多数人理解：她非但没有要求重判那两个日本学生，反而为他们求情。结果是，其中一个被释放，另一个被判刑，而在他服刑期间，母亲不但经常去探望，还去法院为他争取减刑，那个年轻人只关了两三年就恢复了自由。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;母亲带着全家又在日本生活了几年，直到1962年返回美国。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/5p8loEN1xkHBDkKV03QuMmhVUAu8H61h4WBf7px0.jpg&quot;

&lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;1981年，裴宜理在松江与受访者合影&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（受访者提供/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;政治初意识&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;民众抗议活动，是她后来的学术兴趣及学术方向之一。而她对此最初的感性认识，即来自于早期的日本经历。上世纪50年代初期，每逢“五一劳动节”，日本共产党和日本社会党都会组织劳工抗议活动。那一天，裴宜理的父亲正巧经过，抗议者见到这位美国人，开始敲他的车窗玻璃，汽车被人群团团围住……父亲回家后，家人发现车窗玻璃几乎全部碎掉，而震惊中的父亲几乎在发抖。平静下来后，父亲尝试着向女儿解释什么是“五一劳动节”、那些人在抗议什么……这让小小的裴宜理对民众抗议这种形式产生了浓厚的兴趣。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;1960年6月11日，近600万日本人走上街头抗议新版日美安保条约，美国驻日本大使馆附近被近20万日本抗议群众包围。在这庞大的抗议人群里，就有12岁的裴宜理。她特地逃学，走上街头，参加到反对日美安保条约的游行队伍里。在裴宜理的理解中，这个活动的实质并非“反美”而是支持和平，“人们似乎很高兴有一个美国小孩子参加。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;从某种意义上说，这是她第一次参加“群众运动”，也是她第一次体会到群众运动的力量——时任美驻日大使哈格蒂乘坐的防弹轿车也被示威群众包围，大使本人不得不从后门溜进大使馆；预定6月19日访问日本的艾森豪威尔，不得不无限期推迟访问。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;孩童时期的裴宜理也好奇地观察到，在一些抗议活动中，民众的表达方式与庆祝宗教节日的仪式有很多非常相似的地方。比如，在日本的宗教节日中——与中国类似，人们会抬着轿子参加游行，轿子里坐着一个神，然后以一种蛇舞的形式到处走动。 “我很喜欢这种仪式，所以我经常参加我们附近的日本民间节日。我对日本的政治抗议感兴趣的部分原因也来自这种民间仪式。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这个早期经验，后来变成她观察政治活动的一个独特视角。比如，她在对中国革命发源地之一江西安源的调查中就发现，李立三是如何智慧地利用传统的手法，来达到动员工人参加革命的目的：在五月一日国际劳动节这一天，李立三组织了一场工人游行。 “游行队伍当中，有一个八人抬的大轿子，一般来说，地方上的这种庆典，轿子上抬的都是土地神等一些民间宗教中的神，但是这一次，轿子里面是一尊马克思像。”这个细节就被裴宜理用来解剖国家政治动员与传统文化之间的关系。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;1965年，16岁的裴宜理进入威廉·史密斯学院（William Smith College）就读。她迅速置身于另一个汹涌澎湃的政治环境中。裴宜理后来自己总结说：“虽然我对民众抗议的直觉兴趣来自于日本的经历，但我的左翼思想更多地来自于大学时代。”她在大学里非常活跃，参加过帆船俱乐部、戏剧俱乐部、政治俱乐部……但“政治”是她更持久的兴趣和更投入的关怀。她还记得和大学同学们一起搭乘巴士去华盛顿，在五角大楼前参加抗议越战的游行。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;也是在这段时间，她与她出生的中国之间那种看似微弱的联系，又以某种方式变得强烈起来。威廉·史密斯学院规模不大，但有一个“毛泽东思想学习小组”，裴宜理是其中一员，她和同学们一道学习毛泽东思想，对中国政治产生了浓厚的兴趣。不久，她开始下决心学习中文。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但她所在的大学没有中文课，她只能借助图书馆的录音机和几盘磁带开始自学中文。她问学校，是否可以凭借自修中文而获得学分。学校回答：我们没有中文课，怎么评估你的学习程度从而给你学分？裴宜理不甘轻易放弃，跟校方提出：“如果我自学到一定程度，我可以找康奈尔的一位教授来测试我。如果通过，我可以得到学分吗？”学校只好同意。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;裴宜理后来联系上了康奈尔大学的一位教授，对方说：你先通过磁带和语言书自学三个月，然后到康奈尔来接受我的测试。三个月后，裴宜理顺利通过了考试。有意思的是，她后来到台北学过一段时间的中文，台北的中文老师是在北京长大的，她很奇怪这位美国学生的口音，有一次忍不住问：“你的口音是从哪儿来的？你在美国的老师是东北人吗？”“我否认，我想说我的老师是&#39;录音机&#39;不是东北人，但那时我不知道怎么说&#39;录音机&#39;这个词！”回忆此事，裴宜理乐不可支。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“裴宜理”这个中文名字就是在台北学习时取的。很久以后，有一次她查看父亲的书，看到上面的中文图章，才发现父亲的中文名字是“潘学思”。 “所以我应该姓潘而不是裴”，说起这件事，裴宜理流露出一丝遗憾之情。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/WA5K5OwMwAXvSYgB2p4r65LJ0k64mD4kkdoi24OA.jpg&quot;

&lt;h4>;追寻中国革命的起源&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;在密歇根大学攻读政治学博士学位时，裴宜理最初的想法是把中国的“文化大革命”作为博士论文题目，但遭到一位指导教授的反对。老师认为时机尚不成熟。她转而下决心用与当时流行观点不同的视角和方法，去探索中国革命的起源问题。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“如何理解农民革命，这是一个被许多关注农民问题的各科学者所忽略的问题。”她解释自己的研究动机时说，“农民以革命的面目登上世界历史舞台这一事实，推动了许多试图解释农民叛乱原因的社会科学理论的发展。人类学家、历史学家、社会学家和政治学家都对这个重要问题提出了他们各自的答案。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;此时的裴宜理已经流露了自己的“学术野心”：她决定通过对一个地区的研究来考察造反者与革命者之间的关系。这一计划必须集中在一个地区，这个地区必须既有农民造反的传统，又是1949年前共产党的基地。她把这个地区选在淮北。淮北还曾是著名的白莲教活动中心，这一松散的民间宗教组织曾在该地区发动过多次叛乱。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当时中国的大门仍是紧锁的，像其他学者一样，她当时的选择是赴台北故宫博物院看档案，期间也穿插着去日本，在东京的图书馆做资料收集工作。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“我当时是那么年轻而天真，完全不知道这个选题的难度——不然我绝不会蠢到选择这个方向做论文。”又是一阵爽朗的大笑。虽然她幸运地得到很多人的帮助，包括同在那里做研究的几位美国历史学家给了她很多建议，密歇根大学另一位研究中国历史的著名学者费维恺（Albert Feuerwerker）教授也细心地告诉她明清各种档案的位置，但是，“我完全不知道关于这个问题的原始资料是如此分散，它们的类型如此不同。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;另一个障碍是语言。虽然读研究生的时候，她系统学习了两年的中文，包括文言文，但她从来没有像那几位来自美国的历史学家那样，接受过专门的阅读清代文献的训练。所以当她第一次在台北故宫博物院看到清朝档案的时候，几乎被绝望的心情击垮：“我永远无法读懂这些档案！”导师在回信里以不容退缩的口气说：“你得完全做原始档案的研究，而且得看所有的东西。”裴宜理也知道，导师不懂文言文，对阅读梳理明清档案的难度毫无概念，但她还是听从了他的建议。这下没了退路。她发现真正投入进去后，竟然完全有能力阅读那些档案。 “我们当年在台北几乎可以看到你所知道的所有原始档案。比如，你可以拿着两广总督给咸丰写的奏折，上面有咸丰皇帝的批示&#39;知道了&#39;。当你有这种感受的时候，档案内容再晦涩也无关紧要了。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;靠着扎扎实实的工作，裴宜理完成了她的博士论文。 1980年，以论文为基础的专著《华北的叛乱者与革命者》在斯坦福大学出版。这部专著被视为海外中国研究第三代学者的代表作。裴宜理将自己的第一本书献给父母，“没有他们，我就不会从事中国研究。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/XDBAeBrYfBKDdVmYZ9OQbRemzezD2UyCKWonhdJJ.jpg&quot;

&lt;h4>;重返中国&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;“你是在中国出生的？”每次回到美国，入关时的盘问一度让裴宜理感觉自己是一个“二等美国人”。这个场景直到1972年——也就是尼克松总统访华那年——之后才发生了突变。裴宜理记得非常清楚，那一年她从日本旅行回来，入关美国时，像往常一样，移民局官员打开护照，不出意料地问了这一句，裴宜理照例予以肯定的回答。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“我在等待下一个问题：&#39;你为什么出生在红色中国？但没想到，这一次对方的反应是：&#39;噢，真了不起！那你会说中文吗？&#39;我说：&#39;是的，我会说一点。&#39;他说：&#39;我们国家需要你这样的人。&#39;那是我第一次为我出生于中国这件事感到高兴。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;中美关系解冻后，美中关系协会全国委员会（National Committee on Us-China Relations）开始陆陆续续派代表团访问中国，每个团都挑选一位研究中国的学者陪同，以帮助成员们理解中国。 1979年6月，裴宜理被选中参加美国的大城市市长代表团，访问上海、北京、南京、广州和杭州等城市，亲眼看到了长城、故宫、西湖……她兴奋无比。 “我每天早早起床，去公园和当地老百姓交谈，我很喜欢这种感觉，”但另一方面，她又觉得她所看到的中国，不是之前充满革命浪漫想象的那个中国。裴宜理还去上海找到了他们当年在圣约翰大学的老房子，拍了很多校园的照片，带回美国给母亲看。不出意外，母亲在格外震惊之余也格外伤心。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;几个月后，裴宜理再次来到中国，这一次她的身份是访问学者，获得了在华学习一年的机会——她也是第一批被允许进入中国进行田野调查研究的外国学者之一，与她同时来中国的学者还有周锡瑞和黄宗智，后来都成为海外中国研究的中坚力量。她也经历了计划经济下的“票证年代”，“我们互相之间以同志相称，还在学术问题、政治问题的争论中经常引用毛主席语录。”但在革命热潮的背后，她渐渐发现了另一个侧面。比如，作为外国人，她可以坐软卧，普通中国人享受不到；对外营业的餐馆非常少，但像她这样的“访问学者”可以在餐馆的特别区域享受“特供”，普通中国人享受不到，也支付不起。 1980年春天，在南京大学蔡少卿教授的陪同下，裴宜理第一次去安徽调查，在涡阳与蒙城的实地探访，让她对中国农村的真实生活有了更为切身的感受。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;有一年，裴宜理来上海开会时遇到了时任上海社科院院长张仲礼——张早年毕业于圣约翰大学，碰巧是她父亲当年的学生。见面后，他们互相介绍自己正在进行的工作。听到裴宜理下一本书的工作计划之后，张仲礼打趣说：“你是上海人——我很多年前就看到你爸爸在校园里抱着你的样子。为什么不写上海的故事？”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在张仲礼的建议下，自1990年代起，裴宜理的研究目光从遥远的淮北农村转向世界大都会上海，研究重点也从农民革命问题研究变为工人运动研究。她完成了专著《上海罢工：中国工人政治研究》，在这本书里，她也用不少笔墨写了杜月笙、黄金荣这些我们并不陌生的人物，挖掘了他们在工人运动中所扮演的一些真实的角色。这本书获得了1993年美国历史学会费正清奖。 《美国历史评论》评价她兼具“社会科学家对秩序的热爱”与“历史学家捕捉精彩故事的眼睛”。在写这本书时，裴宜理对涉及的劳工阶层做了详尽的调查和分析，其中也包括英美烟草公司。快要结束这本书时，她突然意识到，英美烟草公司在浦东的工厂，就是父亲当年被关押的集中营。 “我没想到，我所研究的对象在某种程度上与我自己家族的历史有非常密切的联系。所以我后来在《上海罢工》英文版序言里的第一句话写道：&#39;对我来说，写作本书有一种回家的感觉。&#39;”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/nmo7yEYcHen9ErQmaxrlIictm9QBHdxe28utFf3H.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/nmo7yEYcHen9ErQmaxrlIictm9QBHdxe28utFf3H.jpg&quot;

&lt;p>;实际上，无论是早期对农民革命的兴趣，还是后来转向对城市工人运动的研究，那些改变了无数人命运的革命，始终是裴宜理关注的大问题。著名历史学家周锡瑞在接受采访时，提过这样一个细节：2007年，裴宜理当选亚洲研究学会主席发表演讲时说，“我们不能忘记中国革命，不能忘记这些大题目，不能忘记如何来理解中国这个大转变到底是怎么发生的。”周锡瑞后来将自己的一本专著送给裴宜理，请她提意见。裴宜理回信给他，再一次说：“我们应该多思考中国的大问题。”——这其实既是裴宜理对同时代做中国研究的学者的期待，也是她对自己时时刻刻的告诫。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;除了学术研究，裴宜理还积极参与公共事务和社会活动。 1999年，到哈佛大学不久，裴宜理即出任海外中国学研究重镇费正清中国研究中心（Fairbank Center for China Studies）的主任。在她名字之前，是费正清、史华慈、孔飞力、傅高义等一系列著名学者；自2008年起，裴宜理又成为另一个分量颇重的学术机构的掌门人——哈佛燕京学社社长。作为最著名的中西学术交流机构之一，哈佛燕京自1928年创立以来已经历了七任社长，从叶理绥、赖肖尔到杜维明等，每一任都是德高望重的学者。裴宜理在学界的地位和影响力可见一斑。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;裴宜理的研究重点是“中国革命”，这在西方的中国研究学界也许有点“非主流”。所以她当选后面对记者的采访，也有感而发：“在很长一段时间里，美国专门研究中国革命的只有区区十几人。这几年，研究中国革命的人又多了起来，毛泽东、&#39;大跃进&#39;、&#39;文革&#39;、抗日战争……都成了热门。”她打趣说：“否则，像我这种研究冷僻课题的家伙估计成不了哈佛燕京的新社长！”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;中美大门打开、中国重新融入世界大家庭之后，商业和经济上的复兴与繁荣或许是最显性最直接的成果。但裴宜理感受更多的，是它在知识与学术交流上产生的巨大意义。过去的一个多世纪，从大清帝国时期到中华民国时期、再进入中华人民共和国，这块土地上发生了太多太大的变化，这或许正是吸引裴宜理研究中国的地方，“它们是如此复杂，又是如此迷人。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 11 Nov 2023 21:25:05 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[陕西回应强砍国槐树事件：属违规占用永久基本农田]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260438]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-11 19:24:52&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;In response to online reports that &quot;more than 30,000 Chinese locust trees were forcibly cut down in Danfeng County, Shaanxi Province&quot;, the local government has established a An investigation team composed of the County Agriculture and Rural Affairs Bureau, County Resources Bureau, County Forestry Bureau and other units conducted on-site investigations. Relevant departments in Danfeng County released the following investigation results on November 11. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After investigation, the location where the problem was reported is located in Taizimiao Village, Caichuan Town, Danfeng County. On July 3, 2023, Caichuan Town received the &quot;Rectification Order for Suspected Pattern Issues of Permanent Basic Farmland&quot; from the Tianchang Office of Danfeng County. It reported that three satellite patches in Taizimiao Village were suspected of illegally occupying permanent basic farmland and requested rectification within a time limit. . After field investigation, it was found that walnut trees and Sophora japonica were planted on the farmland involved in the feedback map, which was indeed an illegal occupation of permanent basic farmland. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After receiving the rectification notice, town and village staff repeatedly publicized the farmland protection policy to the people involved, mobilized cooperation and support for farmland protection work, and in accordance with the laws and regulations of the &quot;Land Management Law&quot; and &quot;Basic Farmland Protection Regulations&quot;, A notice for rectification within a time limit was issued on the spot, and three people refused to make rectification within a time limit. Subsequently, town and village cadres visited the plot many times to help with sales and reduce losses to the masses. However, due to the high density of seedlings planted and the occurrence of dry rot in large areas, no company purchased it. After that, town and village cadres came to communicate with each other many times without success, and the above three people refused to make rectifications within a time limit. On November 2, the Caichuan Town Government, together with the County Agricultural Law Enforcement Brigade, cleared and replanted walnut trees and Sophora japonica seedlings illegally planted on permanent basic farmland. Because planting seedlings on the involved plots of land is illegal and illegal, occupying permanent basic farmland, no compensation matters are involved. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 11 Nov 2023 19:55:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[台剧这十年，内卷+外卷]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260427]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-11 19:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data-mpa-powered-by=&quot;yiban.io&quot;>;The 58th Golden Bell ended at the end of October At the awards, you can see the grand fight between gods in Taiwanese dramas: &quot;Copycat&quot;, &quot;Her and Her&quot;, &quot;A Rampage Female Surgeon Comes to the Village&quot;...

Due to copy-paste and audience fatigue, Taiwanese dramas have entered a period of depression and depression. Idol dramas cannot produce new ideas, local dramas cannot retain audiences, and coupled with the outflow of talent, Taiwanese dramas are in a precarious situation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2014, the well-known TV personality Wang Xiaodi joined forces with eight directors including Tsai Ming-liang, Chen Yuxun, and Qu Youning to establish a company and launched the &quot;Theater Planting&quot; and &quot;QPlace&quot; plans, aiming to build a platform to &quot;give access to It is a space where writers, actors, directors and post-production staff with ideas can be nourished and developed.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Zhi Theater&quot; is mainly divided into four sections: love growth, thriller mystery, horror and supernatural, and drama adaptation. Dramas such as &quot;Love Sandstorm&quot;, &quot;Twilight&quot;, &quot;Please Close Your Eyes after Dark&quot; and &quot;Sixties Boy Turns Adult&quot; have launched the first shot of innovation in Taiwanese dramas. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Tumi&quot; was born out of an idol love drama, mixing elements of parallel time and space to explore different directions of love stories.

The character didn&#39;t have a name at the time, but I felt that he often appeared in my life, even in my room, and I would always think of him, so I gave him a name and determined to write his story. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Your previous two movies are very close to your own life Yes, you and your family are directly on the scene. &quot;It&#39;s a Worth It&quot; is a completely fictional film. What is its relationship with your own life? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Liu Jiayin:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;The previous creations were quite experimental, and &quot;Worthless Journey&quot; is different in every aspect. To a certain extent, it is My debut novel. But this movie still has a lot to do with my personal experience. It is a summary of my life over the past ten years, and everything I want to say is in it. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Looking back over the past ten years, do you think you What are the changes? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Liu Jiayin: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;When I was filming &quot;Cowhide&quot;, I was young, so I just gritted my teeth and made the film. Now my mentality is more complicated and requires greater drive. will be more rational. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I haven’t made a movie for a long time, and there is a high probability that I will never make another one, but I almost never stopped thinking about it. As I get older, I realize that time is limited, and I am afraid of it. If I don’t do something, I can predict what will happen in the future. This is a very specific fear, and it brings great motivation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;From 2006 to the present, you have been a university teacher for seventeen years. What impact has your teaching experience had on you? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Liu Jiayin:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;If I want to teach my class well, I must understand my students. This process is not particularly easy for me, especially since I am very bad at interacting with people. Every time I open the door to meet new students in the new semester, I need to do some mental construction. But what I teach is how to write stories. You must know why students write such things. You can&#39;t just say whether it is good or not. You need to understand them through stories. After slowly adjusting, I roughly knew how to express myself and take care of every student as much as possible. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;You can find the answer by living seriously&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312 , STKaiti;&quot;>;Wenshan needs to come into contact with all kinds of people in his work. Several of his customers appear in the movie, and they all have their own stories. Do these characters have life prototypes? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Liu Jiayin: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;There is no prototype. It mainly comes from daily observation of life and the screenwriter’s skills. A screenwriter should write in a way that makes people believe. In fact, I don’t have any creative skills, I just live seriously. The client&#39;s story is different in age, relationship with deceased relatives and friends, and understanding of emotions. It is similar to the situations we encounter in life. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Wen Shan can’t be a good screenwriter, what do you think? Where is the problem stuck? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Liu Jiayin:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Human beings have a natural part, coupled with their experiences from childhood to adulthood, they have shaped us together and made us what we are today. look. I think Wen Shan encountered too many rejections in his previous work as a screenwriter. He was thought that the things he wrote were too ordinary, not enough for this, not enough for that. In short, the characters he wrote were &quot;not worthy&quot; of being the protagonists. After Wen Shan was denied again and again, he gradually began to doubt himself. Especially when you still can&#39;t pay the rent a few years after graduation and have to ask your parents for rent, it&#39;s a very difficult feeling. This sense of failure not only denies work, but also denies values. Do you think, &quot;Is the way I look at life wrong?&quot; &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I think Wenshan has not tried to defend himself, but his voice is too soft. In this case, a person&#39;s personality will also change. But to a certain extent, a screenwriter who fails to defend his story is failing to defend himself. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Do you think life finally recognized Wen Shan? What does it look like specifically? Recognition? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Liu Jiayin: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;After writing the eulogy, he found that what he had been denied before found answers in life. We can be affected by some small things, and we can also establish real connections with other people. These people are either very dramatic people in the script, or ordinary people who are inconspicuous, but they are very important to the people around them and are important to them. They themselves are also important. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After this, Wen Shan will continue to write stories without any obstacles in his heart. We are often like this, always troubled by some invisible and intangible things, but I am convinced that we can find the answer as long as we live seriously. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;What do you hope the audience will see through this movie? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Liu Jiayin:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;For most people, it is much easier to deny themselves than to affirm themselves. This may be the life of adults. But people still have to care about themselves in the end. &quot;It&#39;s Worth It&quot; tells the story of Wen Shan&#39;s process of starting to care about himself. He realized that his feelings and things he did were important. This may also be the reason why many viewers left me messages saying they saw themselves in the movie. Those who are completely indifferent after watching this movie are the lucky ones, because no one in this movie really succeeds. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;The appearance of &quot;It&#39;s Worth It&quot; can Does it solve some of your previous life confusions to a certain extent? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Liu Jiayin: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I think it was because I solved these confusions that I came up with this movie. In other words, after knowing yourself, you must accept yourself. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 11 Nov 2023 17:25:03 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
