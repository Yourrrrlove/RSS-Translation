When one party accidentally did something wrong and faced jail time, the other party decided to stand up and &quot;take the blame&quot;, completing an agreement that could change their fate almost instantly. There is no verbal communication, the eyes are enough to show the firm trust, and he will not hesitate to be broken into pieces. Director Tsang Kwok-hsiang is well aware of the value of a young man&#39;s eyes, so he shot a large number of close-ups, hoping to show the fire in the young man&#39;s eyes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The eyes were exchanged again, and the location shifted to the visiting room of the detention center. A glass wall separates them from two worlds. The young man&#39;s face overlaps on the glass. You are in me, and I am in you. There should have been a thousand words, but once again, there were no words, just looking at each other, tears streaming down their faces. Soon, their fate will be reversed again. This is also a scene that makes Zeng Guoxiang proud. He insisted on not having any dialogue and what he wanted to say was expressed clearly in his eyes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As of November 6, 2019, the 13th day of release, this movie focusing on college entrance examinations, tutoring and campus bullying has grossed more than 1.2 billion yuan at the box office and has a Douban score of 8.4. Yi Yang Qianxi, who plays Xiaobei, gave an impressive performance, which made him far away from the label of &quot;traffic star&quot;. The discussion also went beyond the movie itself, with many viewers recalling the joys and sorrows of their own growth. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Young You&quot; tells an alternative story about the college entrance examination. In the college entrance examination re-reading class, Chen Nian, a good student played by Zhou Dongyu, witnessed his friends being bullied on campus and chose to shut up. Unfortunately, he himself became a victim of bullying. She is focused on completing more important things, that is, relying on the college entrance examination to change the fate of herself and her mother who ran away to avoid debts. Xiaobei is a &quot;little gangster&quot; who was abandoned by his parents since he was a child and grew up on the streets. They came together by an accident, and Xiaobei soon appeared silently like a shadow on Chen Nian&#39;s way to and from school, protecting her from bullying. How could life be normal? One &quot;derailment&quot; and the dominoes fell. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhou Dongyu has always been quirky and casual, which is often the case in movies. In her first film &quot;July and Ansheng&quot;, which she collaborated with Zeng Guoxiang, she just acted according to her personality, and the director just captured the moments that felt useful. But in &quot;Young You&quot;, Zeng Guoxiang repeatedly told her: &quot;I don&#39;t want Zhou Dongyu.&quot; Many times, Zhou Dongyu almost collapsed. She especially couldn&#39;t understand that if Chen Nian was beaten, he could just beat him back. Why endure it? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I kept explaining to her, because you are not only carrying your own destiny, but also your mother&#39;s future.&quot; Zeng Guoxiang recalled. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zeng Guoxiang also needs to know more things. At first, he could not appreciate the great significance of the college entrance examination to the individual. His father is the famous actor Eric Tsang. He completed his studies in Canada, and his background is very different from that of mainland candidates. He watched a lot of documentaries about the college entrance examination and read related books. During the two days of the college entrance examination, he and his team stayed outside a middle school in Chongqing to capture photos. They stayed there from six or seven in the morning until the students left the examination room, and then they stopped working. Those two days meant a lot to him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The film was shot in Chongqing, and there are many scenes worth pondering. There is a spiral bridge next to the school, which looks like the Colosseum in ancient Rome, reminiscent of the atmosphere of the college entrance examination; at the same time, it spirals upward, like a metaphor for youth growth, and a turning point in the story is also placed here. In real life, this is just a pedestrian bridge at Tongyuanju Subway Station on Chongqing Metro Line 3. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“It’s like a maze. These young children can’t seem to get out of this world. We chose Chongqing because the city has many ups and downs, highs and lows, and many winding alleys. It feels like it takes forever to walk. You can&#39;t leave this place. There are viaducts and buildings everywhere you go, which gives you a feeling of pressure. We hope to present this sense of oppression and the feeling of being trapped in a place in the movie.&quot; Zeng Guoxiang said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On November 1, 2019, Zeng Guoxiang accepted an exclusive interview with Southern Weekend. &lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;&quot;To make a good movie, you must consider things from each character&quot;&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: italics , Italics_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;&quot;Young You&quot; has aroused a very enthusiastic response. What do you think triggered the audience&#39;s enthusiasm? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Zeng Guoxiang:&lt;/strong>;At least in Chinese-language movies, the pain of growing up and school bullying are rarely discussed in this way. I didn&#39;t expect the response to be so big. Of course, when I wanted to make this movie, I also hoped to have such an effect. Let everyone reflect and show a little care and love to the people around them, which can have a positive impact. I have always felt that adolescence is a period that particularly needs protection and protection. Teenagers feel that the world is not good enough. The idea that they can change the world is particularly valuable and requires the protection and protection of adults. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;But in &quot;Young You&quot;, parents are collectively missing of. Chen Nian kept asking where the adults were when she was bullied. What are your thoughts? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Zeng Guoxiang:&lt;/strong>;I don’t want to put the responsibility on anyone. Everyone has the responsibility. This matter is extremely complicated and is not just a problem for parents. Of course, the biggest influence on a child is the parents, but we explained the state of her family in the movie. Everyone is a little powerless, and they don’t treat others like this on purpose. Sometimes the environment is like this, and people like this are formed, and things like this happen. The same goes for schools, teachers, and other students. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Before filming the movie, did you have any interviews with mainland campuses and senior high school students? Do some homework? Have you combined your own experience? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Zeng Guoxiang:&lt;/strong>;We knew at the script stage that the college entrance examination would be a very important element. In fact, it is the timeline and backbone of the entire story. As the coming-of-age ceremony for this group of teenagers, the college entrance examination is a very, very important step. We did a lot of homework before filming. As a Hong Kong director who &quot;went north&quot;, I felt a lot of pressure to shoot such realistic subjects. I want to make sure that the things I shoot are down to earth. After watching it, everyone will feel that this is how they came here. This is the atmosphere during the college entrance examination. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At that time, I read a lot of documentaries and books about the college entrance examination, talked to some teachers and students about their state during the college entrance examination, and talked to the staff or friends around me about how they passed the college entrance examination. The filming of this film started in Chongqing in mid-July 2018. During the two days of the college entrance examination in June, we went to the examination room to capture photos. We stayed there from 6 or 7 in the morning until the students left the examination room after taking the exam before calling it a day and returning. Those two days were particularly meaningful to me. We observed many details and restored them in the movie. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;What are the details? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Zeng Guoxiang:&lt;/strong>;We took pictures of the entire college entrance examination, what clothes parents wore, what they brought students to the examination room, the students’ state and eyes before entering the examination room, What to talk about. We tried our best to faithfully restore what we saw in the movie. Apart from the school uniforms, it does take into account the art of the movie, so it will be made a little neater and more beautiful, but not excessive. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I didn’t put too much of my own experience into the movie. After all, my growing up experience was so different from that of the students in the movie. I just tried to refer to a lot of information and materials and tried to restore what I found interesting. It&#39;s hard for me to say how I feel about it. I can only say that I sympathize with them very much and understand their pressure. Before making this movie, I had been paying attention to the news about the college entrance examination. There were many characters and stories in it, which were very interesting. Every student is burdened with heavy pressure, which is unfamiliar to me and particularly touches me. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although I also experienced the college entrance examination, in Canada at that time, we were quite relaxed. Although it is also a very important exam, I don’t take it that seriously. I think it is an exam that will change our future destiny. When I started working in the Mainland, I came across news reports about the college entrance examination one after another. I was particularly distressed by how much sweat some students put into preparing for the college entrance examination and how much pressure they had to bear. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You majored in sociology at university. Did your professional background help? There are richer sociological issues implicit in &quot;Young You&quot;, such as class and upward mobility. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Zeng Guoxiang: &lt;/strong>;Sociology taught me how to have empathy; after leaving school, sociology taught me how to approach the perspective of different classes, countries, and races. , see things from their perspective. During this filming on campus or before, I worked as a screenwriter and wrote the script. What is the background of each character, what will happen, how to make him have his current values, and his attitude towards things. This is a very big help. . As a director, to make a good movie, you must consider things from each character. &lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;&quot;Use close-up to show the fire in their eyes&quot;&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti ;&quot;>;You and Zhou Dongyu collaborated in &quot;July and Ansheng&quot;. At that time, you asked her to &quot;spare her acting&quot; and capture her suitable moments. Did you take the same approach this time? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Zeng Guoxiang: &lt;/strong>;No. After &quot;July and Ansheng&quot;, there will actually be pressure for us to work together again, because no one wants to repeat what we have done. When I photographed her before, I tried to capture her normal feeling, always going with her more naughty and casual feeling. But this time I suppressed all her past and told her very clearly that I don’t want the Zhou Dongyu of the past, and I hope that everyone can see a very different Zhou Dongyu. She understands very well and wants to find a breakthrough. During this collaboration, what I told her the most was &quot;I don&#39;t want Zhou Dongyu.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;In &quot;Young You&quot;, the audience saw the big Zhou Dongyu Sometimes she is extremely tolerant. For example, she was always bullied by a group of girls in school. It is said that she was very dissatisfied during the filming. According to her character, it would be fine if she was bullied and beaten back. Why should she endure it? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Zeng Guoxiang: &lt;/strong>;She was very entangled when she first started filming. She couldn&#39;t believe it: Why do you have to endure it like this? I kept explaining to her that because you are not only burdened with your own destiny, but also your mother&#39;s future, if you resist and speak out, the result will be that you will not be able to study, review, and take the college entrance examination properly. The latter is more important to you than anything else. important. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So I choose to close my eyes. I feel dissatisfied when others are bullied and cannot bear to see them, but don’t speak out. Later, she became the target of bullying, but she still chose to endure it, because she felt that everything would be fine after this year, and she would be able to leave this place and get into a good university. Her fate was different from that of her mother. So she has been under so much pressure and struggling. I kept explaining to Zhou Dongyu, and after the scene with her mother was finished, she gradually understood. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;There is a scene in the movie that is very impressive. Two teenagers are visiting a prison. faces overlapped on the glass. You also used many close-ups of characters&#39; faces in the film. Is this an aesthetic consideration? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Zeng Guoxiang:&lt;/strong>;The method of overlapping faces is not my innovation. It has been done in many movies, but I think it is very suitable here. I have been analyzing this with the actors, and later on in the interrogation scene, the two people have become one. In the close-up of each person, there is a reflection of another person, that is, I am in you, and you are in me. I like to use a lot of close-ups in my previous films, but this time there are a lot more. Not only the close-ups of the main actors, but also the close-ups of many students, I wanted to capture the eyes and expressions of these teenagers. The young you and the young me have to show the innocence and straightforwardness of their youth. I hope to use close-ups to show the fire in their eyes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;In addition to Zhou Dongyu, Yi Yang Qianxi’s performance in the movie is also good That’s interesting. What specific “training” did you do? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Zeng Guoxiang: &lt;/strong>;It’s not that I changed him. Maybe people were biased against him before, labeling him an “idol” and a top traffic person. &quot;Little fresh meat&quot;, I immediately felt that he couldn&#39;t act. Everyone has not seen him act fairly, but he is actually a very serious boy. From the first day we chatted, to the time he joined the cast, he was really attentive and determined to be a good actor and play the role of Xiaobei well. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the scene where Xiaobei and Chen Nian were chatting about Xiaobei’s mother on the bed, I actually didn’t tell him that I wanted to cry at all. I just talked to him and explained his relationship with his mother. He brewed it by himself and acted it out. When the emotion arrived, tears naturally flowed down his face. This shows that Qian Xi himself is a very sensitive boy, and the mother-son relationship allows him to find the fulcrum to enter the character. &lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;“I hope to give the actors a sense of security on the set”&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_ GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Yi Yang Qianxi and Zhou Dongyu had a rivalry scene. When the two first came into contact, he pushed Zhou Dongyu into the corner. This scene was very tense and the scale was right. How did you explain the scene to him at that time? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Zeng Guoxiang: &lt;/strong>;This is a very good point. He was a little nervous at first. He had never had the experience of pressing a girl against the wall, so he was very embarrassed and shy and didn&#39;t know how to act. I also took a lot of shots during that scene, and I kept guiding and demonstrating to him how to do it. He also needed some time to adjust slowly. Patting and patting, he slowly let go, and we were able to reach the degree we needed. He is a very good actor, but he doesn’t have that much experience. We need to talk to him more and give him more time to meet our requirements for him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Wei Lai, the perpetrator of campus bullying in the movie, happens to be a A very good-looking girl with a good family background. What are your considerations? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Zeng Guoxiang: &lt;/strong>;We met the actors and wrote the script at the same time. I have always been confused about what kind of person to choose to play the role. I don’t want her to become so superficial. In many movies, one look at the person&#39;s appearance and you know that they are definitely the head of the bully, which we want to avoid as much as possible. I met many actors and kept an open attitude to see what kind of people I could meet that would inspire me. Later we met Zhou Ye, and it was actually she who inspired us to think this way. The day she came, we had a strong feeling that she was very confident, and then she was so beautiful and cute. At that time, we felt that if we cast such a person, with such a high starting point, and bullying others, the cruelty would be even stronger. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many times, the people who have the least empathy do not necessarily have poor families or bad backgrounds. Instead, those with good family backgrounds but distorted family views are the most terrifying. They think that others can do whatever they want. I&#39;m at my mercy. So we set it from the beginning that Wei Lai has a good family environment and is good at studying, but her family view is very distorted and she has no empathy. She doesn&#39;t feel that she is doing anything wrong to others. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;To sum up, do you have any unique experience in &quot;training&quot; actors? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Zeng Guoxiang:&lt;/strong>;I have no secret, I am still very honest with actors. I hope to give the actors a sense of security on set, which is very important. Actors often bare their hearts to the audience. If they don&#39;t trust the director and the team, they will often protect themselves and their performance will not be that good. What the director can do is to invest more, shoot this point well, and consider their feelings more. Small things like this allow the actors to slowly build trust in you as the director, and then they will trust your opinions and tips. I often let the actors play the version they think is most correct, and I make adjustments based on that. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 05 Oct 2023 17:55:10 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[我的家乡重庆丨月是故乡明⑤]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257350]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-05 17:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/ 12/02/nszAcS51cXSdJFRcz6yYfmyY5xfdkskn6p7vDzSc.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;940&quot; height=&quot;660&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/12/02/nszAcS51cXSdJFRcz6yYfmyY5xfdkskn6p7v DzSc. jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;174010&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On May 1, 2012, in Ciqikou, Chongqing, citizens raised the Drinking tea and chatting on the rocks &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Liu Song/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;My hometown, Chongqing, is located in the southwest of China&#39;s inland area and the upper reaches of the Yangtze River.

However, more case materials show that during the 20 to 30 years of business activities, Bian Xiuxiu, who was a hawker, also met several leaders of Yu&#39;an District, and with their help, he monopolized the Yu&#39;an District pork market and continued to suppress it.

Bian Moxi dropped out of elementary school and learned to butcher pigs from his second uncle when he was 14, becoming a butcher. In 1991, Bian Xiu began to rent a stall at the Nanmen Farmers Market in Lu&#39;an City, and brought pigs killed in his hometown to the vegetable market for sale. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The case record shows that between 1991 and 2003, Bian Xiuxiu successively met Yan Guang, the coordinator of the Fenlukou Township government who collected the pig slaughter tax, and the two directors of the Pig Office. The former later became the director of his company Deputy General Manager, the latter two provided new opportunities for his pig slaughtering business. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yan Guang is also one of the defendants in this case.

&lt;p>;判决书记载，2013年年初，因为不满一屠户想要拿回屠宰的生猪猪内脏，严光公然对其实施辱骂、殴打，最终掐其脖子推出屠宰场。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;为何不收屠宰费却要强行拿走猪下水？一位曾于2017年从天安公司统一收购猪下水的经营商介绍，多年来，一副猪内脏的价格最低为90元，最高时能达到150元，非洲猪瘟流行时，价格还要更高，而屠宰费价格一般几十元，价值远低于猪内脏。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;经舒城安泰会计师事务所审计，2013年3月至2021年9月，卞修改的两家公司共代宰超过113万头生猪，并用猪内脏抵扣生猪屠宰费的形式，获得7175.6167万元非法收入。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2020年9月，八十多位猪肉小贩联名递交检举信，举报卞修改等人涉黑涉恶。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2021年9月4日下午，国务院第八次大督查第八督导组来到裕安区督查暗访。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;裕安区人民政府办公室同月撰写的情况报告显示，督查主要围绕三项具体民生问题开展：一小区拆迁安置费用问题、一小区水表更换收费问题，以及区内生猪产品流通销售难问题。执法人员打击干扰商户、卞修改名下一处顺鑫屠宰场存在垄断行为等问题也被写入报告当中。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2021年9月4日起连续3天，就生猪屠宰销售问题，时任裕安区区委书记召开4场会议。 9月5日，裕安区政府成立专门的生猪流通领域问题调查组，由7个单位分别牵头开展调查。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2021年9月4日，裕安区政府通报称此前施行的外埠畜产品入裕安备案登记不符合相关法律规定已决定取消。同日，原畜禽屠宰联合执法队撤销，相关责任人也被纪委问责。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这起督查事件在一个月后正式办结。 2021年10月11日裕安区委印发办结报告文件，当中提到，2013年以来，裕安区政府办接连7次下发过生猪屠宰管理工作文件，但经裕安区司法局合法性审查，相关文件均被废止，天安公司法定代表人卞修改也被公安机关刑事拘留并立案侦查。 &lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;法院审理认为，以卞修改、孙长权为首的黑社会团伙，2001年至2007年为初步形成阶段，2012年至2021年，该团伙“通过公权力和组织势力的深度交织，形成一个密不可分的统一整体”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;法院审理认为，卞修改、孙长权犯罪团伙共实施2起抢劫行为，并从2007年开始以执法为名，打压其他肉产品经营者，构成寻衅滋事罪。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;1997年，国务院实施《生猪屠宰管理条例》，在全国推行生猪定点屠宰、集中检疫制度。次年，六安市生猪屠宰管理办公室成立，下设生猪市场稽查大队，负责全市生猪定点屠宰的管理、协调、监督、检查工作。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;由裕安区商务局印发的文件显示，为贯彻落实国务院《生猪屠宰管理条例》规定，裕安区商务局于2000年成立了商务执法稽查中队，由商务局副局长兼任中队长，负责对区内的生猪非定点屠宰、销售，以及活猪外运等内容进行稽查。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2013年6月9日《裕安区“放心肉”体系建设工作总结》中提到，依据《加强外埠冷鲜肉管理》文件，裕安区对外部猪肉进行全程监管，设立报检点，以维护裕安区肉类食品市场秩序。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;南方周末记者统计发现，在与寻衅滋事罪相关的犯罪事实中，共有103件与该犯罪团伙没收其他经营户的肉制品，或阻止其运输、售卖相关，另有7起事实由天安公司强迫屠户以猪下水抵屠宰费等引起。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;孙长权的辩护人认为，在公诉机关指控的一百多起寻衅滋事违法犯罪行动，除了少数几起是因为被害人销售不合格肉品被执法，其余均是因生猪办对外埠肉的稽查而产生的，在当地明确规定生猪办可对外埠肉实施市场准入的情况下，因对政策执行或理解所产生的偏差不应该被认定为是寻衅滋事行为。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;此外，关于抢劫罪，一起犯罪事实发生在2013年10月10日早上6点。当时，天安公司副总经理带队，以六安市城区生猪产品流通管理办法要求，城区生猪产品必须向市商务局申请登记备案，需要“二次报检”为由，对“雨润猪肉专卖店”销售的外地猪肉进行查扣。其间，老板詹显曾持刀阻止并报警，后卞修改、孙帮胜赶到现场，几人发生肢体冲突，店内冷库存放的600斤猪肉最终被查扣。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;孙帮胜也是本案被告人之一，舒城县人民法院以犯黑社会性质组织罪、抢劫罪、寻衅滋事罪判处孙帮胜有期徒刑12年6个月。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;南方周末记者尝试向詹显了解更多当年的信息，但他表示时隔太久，不愿再提。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;除了与生猪买卖相关的犯罪事实，一审判决中还提到，在卞修改的猪肉生意起步的同时，2010年起，卞修改也同孙长权一起进军房地产领域，开发了多个房地产项目，但第一笔启动资金来自挪用的公款。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 05 Oct 2023 16:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[这一天，七位中国选手得到了他们迟到的奖牌]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258110]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-05 15:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;2023年10月4日晚，中国田径运动员递补奥运奖牌仪式在杭州奥体中心体育场举行。&quot;

&lt;p>;阿戈斯蒂尼于1968年在法国艾克斯-马赛大学获得博士学位，目前是美国俄亥俄州立大学教授。克劳茨于1962出生在匈牙利，1991年在奥地利维也纳科技大学获得博士学位，目前是德国马克斯·普朗克量子光学研究所所长和德国慕尼黑路德维希-马克西-米利安大学教授。勒惠利尔1958年出生于法国巴黎，1986年从巴黎皮埃尔和玛丽·居里大学获得博士学位，现任瑞典隆德大学教授。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;勒惠利尔此次获奖，也成为第5位获得诺贝尔物理学奖的女性，此前4位获奖者分别是1903年的玛丽·居里（Marie curie）、1963年的玛丽亚·戈伯特-梅耶（Maria Goppert-Mayer）、2018年的唐娜·斯特里克兰（Donna Strickland）和2020年的安德烈娅·盖兹（Andrea Gates）。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这三位物理学家被授予今年的诺贝尔物理学奖，是因为他们的实验为人类提供了探索原子和分子内部的电子世界的新工具。他们展示了一种创造极短光脉冲的方法，可以用来测量电子移动或者改变能量的快速过程。 2022年，勒惠利尔和克劳斯还因为“对超快激光科学和阿秒物理学的开创性贡献”获得了沃尔夫物理学奖，当时另一位共同获奖的物理学家是加拿大渥太华大学教授保罗·科克姆（Paul Corkum）。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;寻找最快的&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;“快门”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;人类肉眼无法观察到持续时间很短的事件。例如，蜂鸟每分钟可以拍打翅膀80次，但是我们只能在听到嗡嗡声的同时看到蜂鸟模糊的运动。得益于高速摄影技术，我们才能看到像蜂鸟拍打翅膀这类对我们来说转瞬即逝的事件。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;事件发生得越快，想要捕捉这些瞬间，拍摄照片的速度也就要越快。如果我们想探索真正短暂的事件，就需要具备非常特别的技术。在分子和原子的尺度内，事件以极快的速度发生。例如，在一个分子内，原子运动或者发生变化的时间在飞秒的量级。飞秒是非常短的时间，1飞秒等于10&lt;sup>;-15&lt;/sup>;秒。此时，原子的运动可以用激光产生的非常短的脉冲来研究。但是，当电子在原子或者分子内部运动时，因为运动速度过快，在飞秒这个时间尺度内变化会变得非常模糊。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;事实上，在电子的世界中，变化发生在几十阿秒的时间内。阿秒是时间单位，1阿秒等于10&lt;sup>;-18&lt;/sup>;秒，这是极小的时间尺度。 1阿秒相对于1秒，相当于1秒相对于宇宙的年龄。因此物理学家如果想对分子和原子内部的电子世界进行探索，就需要找到足够快的“快门”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/05/dCHhgjLb11KQemJoZt6qZLFqlEBnkQCIRJFPMJ8F.png&quot;

&lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;阿秒物理学给物理学家提供了观察电子运动的机会。 &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（诺贝尔奖官网/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;长期以来，飞秒一直被认为是可能产生的最短光脉冲的极限。改进现有技术并不足以看到在电子运动的极短时间尺度上发生的过程，做到这一点需要全新的技术。今年三位获奖者的实验产生了极短的光脉冲，测量单位是阿秒，从而证明这些脉冲可以用来提供原子和分子内部过程的图像。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;阿秒物理学&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;的诞生&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;光是电场和磁场变化产生的波。不同光具有不同的波长，会呈现不同的颜色。例如，红光的波长约为700纳米，是一根头发丝宽度的百分之一，它以每秒约430万亿次的周期波动。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;最短的光脉冲即光波中单个周期的长度。如果用传统的方法制造超短光脉冲，则每一个光脉冲的时长永远都无法低于飞秒，也就无法实现对电子运动的观测。在20世纪80年代，物理学家认为这是非常难以突破的限制。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;不过，描述波的数学表明，使用大小、波长和振幅（波峰和波谷之间的距离）合适的波，可以构建任何波形。构建阿秒脉冲的秘诀在于通过组合更多波长更短的光来产生更短的脉冲。而想获得这些波长更短的光，就要利用激光穿过气体时产生的一种称作“气体高次谐波”的现象，这里的谐波就像是拨动吉他琴弦时产生的泛音。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;1987年，勒惠利尔发现，当她将红外激光穿过稀有气体时，会产生比之前的实验中更多、更强的“泛音”。激光穿过气体时，激光会与气体中的原子发生相互作用，电子在相互作用中获得的额外能量以光脉冲的形式释放出去，而这些来自电子的光脉冲就是实验中的“泛音”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一旦这些“泛音”出现，它们就会相互作用。当光波的峰值重合时，光会变得更强，但当一个周期中的峰值与另一个周期的波谷重合时，光会变弱。在适当的情况下，“泛音”重合，出现一系列光脉冲，其中每个脉冲持续时间为几百阿秒。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;物理学家在20世纪90年代就理解了这个理论，但直到2001年，他们才在实际识别和测试光脉冲方面取得突破。阿戈斯蒂尼及其在法国的合作者在那一年成功地产生并研究了一系列连续的光脉冲。他们使用一种特殊的技巧，将这些光脉冲与原始激光脉冲的延迟部分组合在一起，以查看泛音之间如何同步。这个过程让他们测量出每个脉冲只持续了250阿秒。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;与此同时，克劳斯和其在奥地利的合作者研究出一种可以选择单个脉冲的技术，他们成功分离出的脉冲持续了650阿秒，该小组用它来跟踪和研究将电子从原子中拉出来的过程。这些实验表明科学家可以观察和测量阿秒脉冲，并且这些阿秒脉冲也可用于新实验。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;阿秒物理学的未来&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;现在，阿秒世界已经近在眼前。这些短脉冲光可以被用来研究电子的运动。物理学家已经可以获得低至几十阿秒的脉冲，并且这项技术一直在发展。诺贝尔物理学奖委员会主席伊娃·奥尔森（Eva Olsson）表示：“我们现在可以打开电子世界的大门。阿秒物理学给我们提供了理解由电子掌控的机制的机会，下一步就是利用这些机制。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;目前，我国物理学家也正在开展阿秒物理学的相关研究，并与包括本次诺贝尔物理学奖得主在内的国际同行进行紧密的合作。例如，中国科学院物理研究所与松山湖材料实验室在广东东莞共同建立了阿秒科学中心，中国科学院物理研究所在北京怀柔科学城建设的综合极端条件实验装置能提供约100阿秒的超快光场，中国科学院西安光学精密机械研究所在2022年成立了阿秒科学与技术研究中心。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;阿秒物理学在很多领域内都具有潜在的应用价值。例如，在电子学研究中，理解并控制电子在一种材料里的行为非常重要。阿秒脉冲还可以用来识别不同的分子，这就可以应用到医学诊断中。未来，我们有望看到阿秒物理学在基础研究和应用研究中发挥更加重要的作用，在帮助我们加深对物质世界的理解的同时，给人类生活带来更多的福祉。 &lt;/p>;

Due to the great success of the mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, Carrico and Weisman have won many major awards including the Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences, the Lasker Prize and so on. The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine this time is truly well-deserved. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/05/fAsK0dPttYF2W8soIvVJrdEUBDYF79H9JgXcOZRc.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;982&quot; height= &quot;736&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/05/fAsK0dPttYF2W8soIvVJrdEUBDYF79H9JgXcOZRc.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253045&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Drew Weissman and Katalin Karikó, the main pioneers of mRNA vaccines. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Cell website/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Pioneer&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Carico 1955 Born in Szolnok, Hungary, after receiving his PhD in Hungary, he moved to the United States in 1985 and entered into postdoctoral research at Temple University in Philadelphia and Bethesda University of Health Sciences, focusing on research on the medical application of mRNA. After experiencing a series of setbacks such as frustrated funding applications, demotions and salary cuts, and suffering from cancer, Carrico met her long-term research partner Professor Drew Weisman. The two met dramatically because of their fight for a copy machine. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At that time, Professor Weismann was already a moderately accomplished immunologist. Weisman, two years younger than Carrico, was born in Lexington, Massachusetts, USA. He received a doctorate in medicine from Boston University in 1987. When he met Carrico, Weissman had just established his own research group at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, working on research in areas such as AIDS vaccines. After learning about Carrico&#39;s research interests, Weisman suggested that Carrico switch to the field of mRNA vaccines and decided to collaborate with her. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But mRNA vaccine research is not easy because mRNA is an extremely unstable small nucleotide molecule. The mRNA molecule is widely present in living organisms. It is the &quot;messenger&quot; for DNA to guide cell cooperation proteins. It is responsible for transmitting the genetic information of the gene to the ribosome, which &quot;installs according to the diagram&quot; and assembles the amino acid &quot;parts&quot; into various proteins. Therefore, mRNA is called messenger RNA. After completing its mission, the mRNA is quickly broken down by enzymes in the cell and its existence time is very short. If mRNA is injected into the body as a vaccine, these mRNA molecules will be broken down quickly before they can instruct cells to synthesize proteins. What&#39;s even more deadly is that animal experiments show that injecting unmodified mRNA into the body can trigger an immune response in the body, leading to serious adverse reactions to the vaccine. mRNA vaccines have also been ignored. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In response to these problems, Carrico and Weisman conducted a series of studies. Although funds were limited, they still persisted in this direction and made some major breakthroughs. In 2005, Carrico and Weisman discovered that some natural nucleotides in messenger RNA were important factors in causing adverse immune responses in the body. They found the nucleotides in messenger RNA that triggered adverse immune responses, and then used artificially synthesized Nucleotide replacement significantly weakened adverse immune responses. This study laid a key foundation for the subsequent development of mRNA vaccines. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Later, Carrico, Weisman and others improved the messenger RNA vaccine to increase the stability of the mRNA vaccine in the body. For example, they used a liposome &quot;coat&quot; to coat the messenger RNA vaccine. Wrap it up so that it cannot be broken down by nucleases before entering the cell. With the continuous improvement of technology, there is increasing hope for the industrialization of mRNA vaccines. Compared with traditional vaccines, mRNA vaccines have some obvious advantages, such as good safety, short design and development cycle, low production cost, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;New Opportunities&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;However, before the outbreak of the new crown epidemic, mRNA vaccines had been tepid. At that time, dozens of mRNA-based vaccines were being developed around the world, and a few vaccines such as influenza vaccine, Zika virus vaccine, and rabies vaccine had entered clinical trials, but none had yet been approved for human disease prevention. This situation quickly changed due to the global pandemic of the new coronavirus. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Thanks to long-term accumulation, BioNTech, a German biotechnology company where Carrico serves as vice president and head of RNA therapy development, quickly launched new crown vaccine research and development after the outbreak of the new crown epidemic. The mRNA COVID-19 vaccine BNT162b2, which targets the spike protein of COVID-19, was developed. Due to the emergency of the epidemic, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has also given the green light to clinical trials of COVID-19 vaccines such as mRNA vaccines, greatly shortening the pre-clinical animal testing and clinical trial time of COVID-19 vaccines, which originally took several years or even more than ten years. The clinical trial was completed in just 7 months. Fortunately, BNT162b2 not only shows good safety, but the effectiveness of the vaccine has also reached an astonishing over 90%, which is significantly better than traditional vaccines. Since the end of 2020, most countries and regions around the world, including the United Kingdom and the United States, have successively approved the emergency use of BNT162b2 vaccine. At the same time, the new coronavirus RNA vaccine mRNA-1273 developed by the American company Moderna also achieved similar results, and this vaccine is also based on the patented mRNA vaccine technology of Carrico and Weissman. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In less than a year from vaccine design, clinical trials to approval for marketing, BNT162b2 and other mRNA COVID-19 vaccines have created a miracle in the history of vaccine research and development. This is of course related to the global pandemic of the new crown epidemic, but it is mainly due to the good safety and excellent effectiveness of the mRNA new crown vaccine. Judging from the real application data of subsequent large-scale immunization and the preventive effect against new coronavirus variants, mRNA new coronavirus vaccines such as BNT162b2 also performed well. According to the Nobel Prize website, more than 13 billion doses of COVID-19 vaccines have been administered around the world, saving millions of lives. BNT162b2 and other mRNA COVID-19 vaccines are among the most outstanding vaccines. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Vaccine revolution? &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;If the mRNA vaccine can only work in the new coronavirus epidemic, its charm will be greatly reduced. In fact, greatly encouraged by the success of the mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, dozens of clinical studies based on mRNA vaccines around the world are accelerating. If its application scope can be expanded, the mRNA vaccine technology pioneered by Carrico and Weismann is expected to start a vaccine revolution. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are currently two main application directions for mRNA vaccines. The first major application direction is to prevent infectious diseases. In addition to COVID-19, the current mRNA vaccines against human infectious diseases caused by pathogens such as epidemic viruses, Zika virus, cytomegalovirus, and respiratory syncytial virus have also entered Phase II or III. Clinical Trials. According to a press release issued by Moderna on September 13, 2023, the company has submitted marketing authorization applications for the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) mRNA vaccine globally, and the seasonal influenza mRNA vaccine has been approved in three clinical trials. All trials also demonstrated acceptable safety and tolerability. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The second main application direction is the treatment of cancer. According to the US clinical trial website, there are currently nearly 50 mRNA vaccines related to cancer treatment in the world that have entered or completed phase II clinical trials, including Bion. A number of mRNA vaccines for cancer treatment developed by companies such as Tektronix and Moderna have entered Phase II clinical trials. These vaccines mainly target cancers such as melanoma, colorectal cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, and head and neck squamous carcinoma. Among them, there are high hopes that mRNA vaccines can be used in combination with other anti-tumor drugs to improve the effectiveness of cancer treatment. According to the results of a phase II clinical trial jointly released by Moderna and the US pharmaceutical giant Merck at the end of 2022, an mRNA vaccine developed by Moderna performed well when used in combination with Merck&#39;s checkpoint inhibitor Keytruda. Good, over 1 year, the mRNA vaccine combined with Keytruda led to a more than 40% reduction in the risk of cancer recurrence or death in patients with stage 3/4 melanoma compared with Keytruda alone. Moderna and Merck plan to launch phase III clinical trials of this treatment in 2023. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As of now, apart from the multiple COVID-19 vaccines that have been approved for marketing, no mRNA vaccine has yet been approved for marketing. It remains to be seen whether the mRNA vaccine can show promising results in the prevention of other infectious diseases and cancer treatment. However, judging from the current progress of clinical trials, it is only a matter of time before a new mRNA vaccine is approved for marketing. The vaccine revolution initiated by mRNA technology may come soon. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 05 Oct 2023 13:55:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[兰州一高中两老师深夜围殴学生：“突击查寝”制值得反思丨快评]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258086]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-05 13:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Recently, a school violence incident has attracted attention. According to a report by China Morning Post, based on the statements of parents and dormitory administrator Ma, the timeline of the incident is as follows: At 11:40 pm on September 26, four persons, principal Wu and director of admissions office Hao, entered the They searched the dormitory and violently kicked in the door before entering. Suspecting the students to smoke, Wu and another teacher worked together to beat two students in the dormitory. The beating lasted for more than an hour, and the four did not leave until 1:20 a.m. the next day. During this period, Hao kept shouting, &quot;Beat him to death. If he is beaten to death, send him to the hospital.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the incident, a student suffered from syncope and nosebleeds. The dormitory manager, Ma, fed the child candy and stayed with him to comfort him for more than two hours. Afterwards, &quot;the school confiscated the phone and watch and asked the students to write a guarantee not to tell their parents.&quot; Three days later, both parents &quot;discovered&quot; that the child had symptoms such as facial bruising, lethargy, nightmares and convulsions, and this brought the matter into the public eye. The parents first contacted the dormitory manager, Teacher Ma. After hearing about this, Teacher Ma was &quot;filled with indignation and resigned.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the recorded conversation between Teacher Ma and the principal Wu, Wu apologized and admitted that &quot;the action was a bit too big and a bit extreme&quot; and &quot;has already apologized to the students and parents.&quot; Afterwards, Teacher Ma also told the media that students on the entire floor witnessed the atrocities that night and &quot;I have no intention of doing it anymore.&quot; After the media called the principal Wu, Wu simply said, &quot;We are dealing with this matter.&quot; At present, the Lanzhou Municipal Government has established an investigation team on this matter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The timeline of this incident is not complicated, but there are still many questions that are worth analyzing one by one. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First of all, the details of the incident are still quite ambiguous. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Judging from the origin of the incident, the dormitory manager surnamed Ma said that he was &quot;inspecting the student dormitories on behalf of the school, but he did not expect to be so ruthless.&quot; It seems that the reason why the principal and his party entered the dormitory to check the dormitory and violently beat them was because they &quot;suspected the students of smoking.&quot; So, did the two students smoke? Why did the principal and his team violently kick in the door during the bed check? These are two key issues in this assault. There should be a logical chain between the student closing the door, the principal kicking the door and the student suspected of smoking to explain the cause of the incident. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The facts presented in the current media reports and interviews with the parties can only be interpreted as &quot;the students did smoke and locked the door for fear of being punished. The principal failed to open the door and then violently kicked it in, and finally surrounded him.&quot; . Even if two students do smoke, the principal and others can only punish the students, not corporal punishment, which is prohibited by the Teachers Law and the Compulsory Education Law. If the two students were not smoking at all, the behavior of the principal and others would be tantamount to violent madness. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Article 7, paragraph 3, of the &quot;Penalty Rules for Primary and Secondary School Education&quot; (Trial) stipulates that if &quot;smoking, drinking, or behaving inappropriately and violating the student code&quot;, the school and its teachers should stop it and provide criticism and education , education and punishment can be implemented if necessary. However, any kind of disciplinary action does not include the violent beatings in this incident, which is &quot;corporal punishment that directly causes physical pain by hitting, stabbing, etc.&quot; which is expressly prohibited in Article 12. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If the accusations made by the boarding manager and parents are true, then the principal Wu and others are also suspected of illegal and criminal acts. Judging from the descriptions of &quot;facial bruises&quot; and &quot;nosebleeds,&quot; the two victims may have met the criteria for &quot;minor injuries.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Secondly, this incident also shows a major problem in the current teaching management of primary and secondary schools, that is, there is an almost absolute &quot;management and obedience&quot; relationship between schools and students. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is a power relationship between teachers and students, and the principal and director of the admissions office are higher &quot;superiors&quot; than teachers. They come out to &quot;check the bed&quot; to discipline students, and they are also unconsciously or consciously expanding this power, which includes the power to unconditionally discipline students with corporal punishment. At the same time, students must obey the principal and other superiors unconditionally, otherwise they will face an escalation of corporal punishment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the current law, once a violation of the student code such as &quot;student smoking&quot; occurs, on the one hand, the school can only punish and educate the students instead of corporally punishing and beating the students. On the other hand, the main responsible person they should hold accountable should be It is merchants who sell cigarettes to minors, parents or guardians who instigate or allow minors to smoke, rather than violently punishing minors who smoke. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Finally, this incident also makes people rethink the management system of student dormitories and the so-called &quot;surprise dormitory inspection&quot; system. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The original intention of the student dormitory management system is to improve dormitory management, protect student safety, and ensure learning and living conditions. However, schools at all levels are now using the banner of &quot;benefiting students&quot;, which naturally takes over the private space of students&#39; study and life. In this incident, the principal and his team came to check the dormitory room at 23:40 in the evening and violently kicked the door. From every angle, they were eroding or even violating the students&#39; private space. As adults, college students will naturally complain about regulations such as &quot;forced self-study&quot;, &quot;locking the computer&quot;, and &quot;checking the bed every night&quot;; and judging from this incident, even if the high school students are minors, such &quot;surprise bed checks&quot; are not allowed. It was too harsh, and the subsequent &quot;confiscation of phones and watches&quot; further demonstrated the willfulness of those in power. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;High school students, mostly between the ages of 15 and 18, have the right to start taking over their own lives, manage their own personal space, and be responsible for their own actions. Whether high school boarding schools still need to treat older children like little ones is debatable, at least in terms of the dormitory management system. Schools should give students more private space to cultivate students&#39; self-management skills and better prepare them for adult life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In short, the problem exposed in this incident is not just a simple issue of school violence, but also reveals problems in the teaching management of primary and secondary schools. As quasi-adults, high school students cannot just be subordinates who accept management and punishment unconditionally, but are future masters who should be cared for and cared for in the adult world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 05 Oct 2023 13:25:03 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[“文坛祖母”冰心 用爱温暖世纪丨那年今日]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257697]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-05 12:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 05 Oct 2023 12:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[提升软环境，善待游客始]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258090]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-05 11:30:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;The Mid-Autumn Festival and the National Day are on consecutive holidays, and travel is popular. Experts estimate that more than 100 million people will travel during this long holiday. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Self-driving has become the mainstream during long vacations. For those car owners who drive to Xi&#39;an, Shaanxi, Mianyang, Sichuan, Xinxiang, Henan and other places, this year&#39;s journey will have a lot less worries: the traffic police departments in these places recently announced that minor violations of foreign tourists&#39; vehicles will not be punished during the holidays. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Such &quot;flexible law enforcement&quot; measures are generally welcomed by car owners. The car is in a different place and the road in life is unfamiliar. Even if you have a navigation system, various situations will inevitably happen. If you are slapped with a ticket and fined for this, you may not be in a good mood for the whole day. There are no penalties for minor violations of laws by foreign vehicles. This will allow foreign tourists to relax and have fun without having to worry about getting into trouble or losing money. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The actions of the traffic police in these places are not illegal, but based on evidence. The Administrative Penalty Law clearly stipulates that if the violation is minor and is corrected in a timely manner without causing harmful consequences, no administrative penalty will be imposed; if the violation is for the first time and the harmful consequences are minor and the harmful consequences are corrected in a timely manner, administrative penalties may not be imposed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the other hand, the fundamental purpose of punishing traffic violations is to ensure safe and smooth traffic and improve traffic efficiency. If some minor violations do not cause traffic congestion or affect traffic safety and traffic efficiency, they do not need to be punished. If you use a high-power magnifying glass to see defects and you are punished for minor violations, it becomes a fine for the sake of fines, which is putting the cart before the horse. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Currently, tourism has become an important economic driving force in many cities. To attract tourists, in addition to unique attractions, the soft environment is also an important aspect of attraction. For example, this year&#39;s Zibo barbecue fire caused many tourists from out of town to come by car. There was no room in the parking lot, so some people parked their cars on the roadside. Faced with these illegally parked out-of-town vehicles, the Zibo traffic police did not come up and issue a punishment note. Instead, they called each one to notify them to move the vehicles. This practice was praised and attracted more people to Zibo to eat barbecue. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past, there were some places that had &quot;extremely strict law enforcement&quot; on foreign car owners. I drive this road, and when foreign car owners come, they have to find faults and fines. Some places even deliberately set up law enforcement traps to punish outsiders. In this way, foreign car owners are treated as &quot;water fish&quot;, and they will not come next time. Not only will they not come, they will also post online to appeal to others not to come. When such word-of-mouth evaluation spreads, there will naturally be fewer and fewer tourists, and the tourism economy will be out of the question. On the contrary, if foreign tourists are &quot;softly enforced&quot; and try not to be punished, so that tourists feel comfortable, they may stay here for a few more days. Next time they come, they will take the initiative to do voluntary publicity online. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, foreign car owners who enjoy flexible law enforcement treatment must also consciously abide by traffic rules, try not to violate the rules, do not create congestion in the local area, and be decent in both directions. After all, only good traffic order can bring a relaxing and pleasant travel experience. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The tourism environment is part of the business environment and a reflection of the overall business environment. There used to be some places that specifically targeted foreign investment merchants. In the early stage, they used various &quot;preferential policies&quot; to attract foreign merchants to invest in and build factories. After that, they started to &quot;harvest the wool&quot;. Not only were the original promises unable to be fulfilled, but they also had to eat all kinds of food. To get the card, &quot;beat the foreign businessmen to internal injuries and strip the domestic businessmen naked.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What kind of business environment there is, there will be what kind of investment enthusiasm. From the tourism environment to the business environment, they are essentially a reflection of the level of local public governance. Paying attention to one&#39;s own reputation and reputation is the basic prerequisite for local public governance to become good governance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 05 Oct 2023 11:55:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[“遛街子”累麻了，年轻人开始了“宅”式度假]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257631]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-05 11:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 05 Oct 2023 11:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[“不是我不够努力” ：被清退的编外人员，如何过难关]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258088]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-05 10:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/04/1hbW3iqPCOVYPyAfvKOHLi72oS4xe6bm0iRJwOfY.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/04/1hbW3iqPCOVYPyAfvKOHLi72oS4xe6b m0iRJwOfY. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253009&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On September 7, 2023, a hospital in Zhejiang Province launched nursing skills training for nurses. Pictures and texts are irrelevant. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;You are no longer from our hospital.&quot; One sentence announced that Chen Min has been a non-staff nurse for ten years The end of a career. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In front of two doctors, three bedded patients and their families in the ward, the dismissal notice came suddenly. Staying for a second longer makes you feel embarrassed. In September 2023, Chen Min recalled to Southern Weekend that after hearing the order to leave, she did not hesitate, returned to the office, took off her nurse uniform, took away the cup and notebook, and kept a group photo with the department. In the cupboard. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Eight months ago, Chen Ming just turned 35 and became the first batch of labor dispatch workers dismissed from a second-class hospital in Hunan where she worked. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past ten years, she has shuttled between wards and departments, looking no different from other nurses. But somewhere invisible, there is always a thread named &quot;weaving&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Using this line as the boundary, people like Chen Min who work in state agencies or institutions in the form of labor dispatch but are not within the establishment are called &quot;non-staff personnel.&quot; In addition, common non-staff personnel include “contract workers” hired by government agencies, hospitals, schools and other units who sign contracts with workers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In recent years, information about “retiring non-staff personnel” that has appeared from time to time has attracted attention to this group. In 2022, Fangxian County, Hubei Province promoted the standardization of the clean-up of non-staff employed personnel, and stated that &quot;the clean-up of non-staff personnel involves a wide range of areas and a large number&quot;, and the clean-up process needs to &quot;effectively safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of government agencies, institutions and non-staff personnel.&quot; In February 2023, a symposium on the clean-up and standardization of non-staff personnel held in Tongcheng City, Anhui Province mentioned that clean-up and retirement is not the ultimate goal, but to standardize and rectify the chaos of non-staff employment and improve government administrative efficiency and service levels. Provide employment assistance for retired personnel, and actively and steadily promote special actions to clean up and standardize non-staff personnel.&quot; In August, the Lichuan City Institutional Establishment Committee Office in Hubei Province stated that the city had eliminated 301 irregular non-staff employees. In Jianli, Hubei, Linxiang, Hunan, Harbin, Heilongjiang and other places, public information shows that the removal of non-staff personnel is also in progress. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this wave, some non-staff personnel are deeply frustrated, and some take the opportunity to step out of their comfort zones and look for a decent job again. News from Daoxian County, Yongzhou City, Hunan Province stated that as of September 20, 1,038 laid-off non-staff personnel had been re-employed in the county. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Premonition of unemployment&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The non-staff personnel interviewed had a premonition of being laid off. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As early as 2022, Chen Min heard from colleagues about the news of eliminating non-staff personnel. At first, he didn’t believe it. Later, he searched online and found that other cities had taken action. But the news only circulated secretly in the hospital, and she never saw the red-headed document. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On December 31, 2022, the contract signed by Chen Min with a third-party labor dispatch company expired. The hospital leader told her that &quot;the epidemic has just ended and there is no time to sign the contract, so she must go to work first.&quot; Just two or three days later, she was fired on the grounds that &quot;the state had issued a policy.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In March 2023, similar &quot;gossip&quot; spread in a hospital in Dengta City, Liaoning Province. Li Zhen, 28, has worked in the vaccination department of the hospital for nearly seven years. In this hospital with less than 400 employees, it only takes a few turns for the news to reach her ears. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, Li Zhen felt the signal even stronger. Salaries that cannot be paid on time, successive layoffs in other departments, rumors that leaders in charge of each department are fighting to keep their subordinates, the newly appointed dean twice went to the vaccination department and mentioned &quot;there are too many people&quot;... these have given rise to unemployment. The real feeling of pressing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The more precise news came on the night of May 16, the day before she was dismissed. She heard from a relative who had an acquaintance working in the hospital that the layoffs might &quot;be your turn.&quot; A few.&quot; The next day, the leader in charge of the department called: &quot;There is bad news. You can&#39;t keep it this time.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Zhen said that in the memories of the old nurses at the hospital, there were more than 30 people working in the hospital. This is the first time that no one has been laid off in recent years. The hospital told her, &quot;The hospital now owes money and cannot support so many people. You should understand the hospital.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hu Xiaodong, a professor at the School of Politics and Public Administration at China University of Political Science and Law, analyzed to Southern Weekend the existence of non-staff personnel. There are historical reasons for this and development, which were influenced by the thinking of “more people make things easier” and the increase in workload at that time. When public institutions like hospitals are saturated with workload and existing staff cannot complete the work, they recruit non-staff personnel to assist in the work. And the hospital&#39;s &quot;most of the funds for supporting non-staff personnel come from their own income.&quot; The main reason for dismissing non-staff personnel now may be related to its own profits and policies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, Hu Xiaodong mentioned that the &quot;Party and State Institutional Reform Plan&quot; released in March 2023 mentioned streamlining the establishment, but it was limited to central and state agencies and local party and government agencies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Non-staff personnel in some government agencies have been affected before. 29-year-old Lin Jiangtao has been working in a government unit in Yuxi, Yunnan for four years. At the end of December 2022, while he was on paternity leave, he received a notice of competitive employment from the unit. Due to economic layoffs, 36 people outside the establishment were required to undergo written examinations and interviews. Decided to stay or go. &quot;I probably understood it when I heard this. I guess I will be laid off this time.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Uneasiness surged in Lin Jiangtao&#39;s heart. He recalled that at that time, he frequently looked at job information on local talent recruitment websites, viewed short videos on social media that taught people how to deal with middle-aged unemployment, and even asked a master to tell fortunes. Lin Jiangtao sent his birth date and work address, and the master told him that he &quot;may not be unemployed.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For insurance, Lin Jiangtao hired a teacher to conduct structured interviews, which cost 1,500 yuan for two days. On December 29, 2022, the day before his birthday, he still received a text message that he was dismissed. He was competing for the last place in the induction examination. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The removal of non-staff personnel is related to the reduction of staff. Hu Xiaodong explained that the key to the increase or decrease of establishment is whether the use of establishment can improve work efficiency. Nowadays, non-staff personnel in government departments at all levels bear the actual work of many internal staff. “It is necessary to return the civil servant work performed or replaced by existing non-staff personnel to the civil servants themselves and return the responsibilities of civil servants.” &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Before the crisis&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;After graduating from technical secondary school, Li Zhen once thought about working in Shenyang, which is 40 to 50 minutes&#39; drive away from home. As the only child in the family, her father was reluctant to let her go away, so he asked someone to find connections to get her to come to this hospital. Although the average salary was only more than 2,000 yuan a month, &quot;as long as she has a place to occupy herself.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are eight people in the vaccination department, all of whom are &quot;contract workers.&quot; Li Zhen is mainly responsible for vaccine information registration in the department. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Almost all children in the county are vaccinated at their hospital. During busy times, it takes three hours in the morning to register the information of about a hundred children. Over time, Li Zhen developed the habit of speaking and typing quickly. When I met the children and parents who came for vaccination, I blurted out three key questions in Northeastern dialect: &quot;Is the child sick, has he taken medicine, and is he healthy?&quot; In the time it takes a new colleague to enter the information of one child, Li Zhen can enter the information of three. As soon as he sees the child&#39;s age in months, he knows which injection should be given to the child. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When you have free time, you can get off work early after finishing your busy morning. &quot;The job is easy, the salary is fixed&quot;, and there is also medical insurance and pension insurance paid by the hospital - this is already a good job in a small county. Li Zhen has no mortgage, car loan or children, and her husband&#39;s monthly salary is five to six thousand yuan. They live a stress-free life in a small county with low prices. With the idea of ​​&quot;leaving this place for retirement&quot;, Li Zhen never thought of leaving. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before the unemployment crisis, many people believed that non-staff work could be done &quot;until retirement&quot; because it was &quot;close to the establishment.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The same goes for Lin Jiangtao. In his view, his job is no different from that of a clerk, &quot;delivering information, setting up accounts, and at most compiling information at the end of the year.&quot; Because of the nature of the company, I need to go to the company for safety inspections, and I don’t have to strictly stay on duty. There are also five insurances paid by the company. “I can’t find a more satisfying (job) than this.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When &quot;Lingping&quot; was in the unit, two or three non-staff colleagues left because they were admitted to civil servants or public institutions. Lin Jiangtao felt envious, but did not act. It wasn&#39;t until he lost his job that he realized how &quot;fragrant&quot; the establishment was. If the time could go back ten years, he would like to advise his 19-year-old self to make a good life plan and consider taking a job. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the cruel reality is that even if Lin Jiangtao goes back to ten years ago and tries his best to take the exam, the result may not be satisfactory. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Chen Min spent ten years preparing for the exam. From the time she got a part-time job, her life was spent working and preparing for exams. After get off work every night, her schedule is to go back to her room to read and prepare for exams. She is unable to respond to her colleagues&#39; calls to eat and play cards, and she cannot &quot;waste&quot; more time cooking or spending time with her family. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Unlike the comfort Lin Jiangtao felt at work, Chen Min&#39;s work in the hospital was unstable. In the past ten years, she has been rotated through at least eight departments. The shortest one she stayed in was only half a year, and the doctors in the department were not fully recognized. The longest one was less than three years. When I go to some new departments, I even have to start from scratch. However, the transfer of colleagues within the staff will not be so frequent. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In her perception, hospital employees are divided into four levels based on employment forms. The highest level is within the establishment, followed by personnel agency, labor contract, and labor dispatch. Dispatched workers also have five insurances and one housing fund, but their wages are the lowest. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The difference buried in daily work always reminds me that I am a &quot;non-staff person&quot;, and the age limit of &quot;under 35 years old&quot; for the staff examination is tightly pressed, which further intensifies Chen Min&#39;s pursuit of staff. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Whenever there is a recruitment announcement in her hospital, Chen Min will sign up. On several occasions, she passed the written exam but was dropped again after the interview. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/04/HUsJgmRsZHd34X3wdBGavXwIPRGxouwipDVaif7w.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;768&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/04/HUsJgmRsZHd34X3wdBGavXwIPRGxouwipDVaif7w.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253010&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Many places require that the removal of non-staff personnel be actively and steadily promoted. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Survival and Emotion&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;After being fired, for more than a month, Chen Min is immersed in anxiety and relies on medication to maintain sleep every day. At a rehabilitation hospital near her home, Chen Min was diagnosed with moderate depression. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The treating doctor advised Chen Min to learn to look away and not push herself too hard. Her parents-in-law also told her that it didn’t matter if she didn’t go to work. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For those who have accumulated some &quot;capital&quot; after working for many years, after losing their jobs, survival is not the first concern that arises, but emotions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Over the past few years, Chen Min considers himself devoted to his work. Her home is close to the hospital, only ten minutes&#39; walk. When she was not working the night shift, she also told the doctors and nurses after work, &quot;If you are too busy at night, just call me and I will come right away.&quot; Her WeChat ID is still left in the previous department for patients Appointments, consultations, return visits. Chen Min described her work as her lover, and the sudden unemployment felt like being separated from her lover. &quot;It will probably be difficult to get out of it within a year or two.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For retired non-staff personnel, a buffer period may be needed. Hu Xiaodong mentioned that for the sake of humanistic care, the unit should set up a buffer period to &quot;give them a buffer space from psychology to behavior. The unit can also help non-staff personnel who are about to be laid off find new jobs in accordance with laws and regulations.&quot; In addition, he also suggested designing a return-to-work appointment system. When these non-staff personnel are needed again in the future, units can give priority to hiring personnel with return-to-work certificates. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to divert his attention and renew his suspended social security payment, Chen Min began to look for a new job. Health care centers, specialized hospitals, private clinics, confinement centers, and places related to nursing are the first to be considered. More than ten years ago, she applied for the nursing major because &quot;it was easy to find a job.&quot; Now the number of nurses has exceeded 5 million, and employers have more and younger choices. Chen Min said that because she was over 35 years old, she was either unable to register for the exam or was not accepted. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lin Jiangtao also encountered a similar situation. He saw a job opening at a vocational training company on the local talent recruitment website. On the day of the interview, his boss, who was in his forties, introduced to him what he had achieved in his twenties and asked him: &quot;Why are you still looking for a job at the age of 29?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lin Jiangtao restrained his emotions. , replied calmly: &quot;Why can&#39;t you find a job at the age of 29? People who are 59, 69 or even 79 may be looking for a job.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When he first lost his job, Lin Jiangtao also had self-doubt. But soon, he told himself that when he was at a low point in his life, he must not push himself too hard or go against himself; when he encountered a suitable opportunity, he would take the initiative to fight for it, but there was no need to be too anxious. &quot;Looking for a job is like looking for a partner, take your time.&quot; . &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Step out of the comfort zone&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;From May to August, Li Zhen rested at home for three months. Not long ago, he went to Nantong, Jiangsu, intending to try home textile live broadcast. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are requirements for live broadcasts. You must dress fashionably and wear heavy makeup. You can&#39;t just wear sportswear and white shoes on the inside, a nurse&#39;s uniform on the outside, and light makeup like you do in the hospital. Even when he speaks, he pays attention to standard Mandarin. &quot;After speaking Northeastern dialect for so many years, it suddenly feels so awkward.&quot; Li Zhen stood next to the anchor, feeling a sense of discomfort that made her shrink back. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After staying in Jiangsu for half a month, Li Zhen returned to his hometown and spent 7 days learning to make milk tea locally. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In September, she and her friends opened a milk tea shop near the school. Although it was more tiring, she could adapt. The work is busier than before, but she thinks that the more work she does, the more she will get. &quot;Maybe by selling this extra hour, I can make more money. I think it is for myself.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some people have taken bigger steps, such as Chen Min, who moved from the hospital to small restaurants and barbecue stalls. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After looking for a job for more than a month and asking for more than 20 nursing-related positions, Chen Min still found nothing. After consulting teachers from her previous school, she turned to preparing for the Licensed Pharmacist Qualification Certificate. If she passed the exam, she could work in a chain pharmacy. &quot;It&#39;s relatively stable and there&#39;s no age limit.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But before that, I have to find a job to transition. Chen Min walked along the street from shop to shop until he saw a notice recruiting waiters at a small restaurant on the street, and worked as a waiter there. After being introduced by the restaurant owner&#39;s wife, I came to work part-time as a dishwasher at a nearby barbecue stall. The total of the two salaries is not much different from that of working in the hospital. Chen Min also paid social security again in the form of flexible employment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, Chen Min still has her own concerns about these two jobs. When looking for a job, she deliberately avoided being near the hospital because she didn&#39;t want to run into her former colleagues. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When working in the hospital, the nurses wear the same uniforms and masks, with their eyes exposed. Most of the time, patients have difficulty even distinguishing nurses with different appearances, and they treat nurses with the same courtesy and respect. But after taking off her nurse&#39;s uniform and mask, she was still a little worried when facing the guests, food and dishes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Now her time is divided into four periods. She gets up at 7 a.m. to prepare for the exam, works as a waiter in a restaurant from 10:30 a.m. to 7 p.m., then washes dishes at a barbecue stall, and returns around 12 p.m. home, and then continue reading until 2 o&#39;clock in the morning. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Her parents-in-law still take care of everything at home for her, and her husband also supports her to continue taking exams and do what she wants to do. Occasionally, my 7-year-old son saw Chen Min reading in her room and brought her own books to keep her company. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On social media, Chen Min wrote: &quot;My failure to pass the establishment examination is definitely not because I didn&#39;t work hard enough, but I still believe that hard work will reward me in another way.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt; p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(Chen Min, Li Zhen and Lin Jiangtao are pseudonyms)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>; Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 05 Oct 2023 10:25:02 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
