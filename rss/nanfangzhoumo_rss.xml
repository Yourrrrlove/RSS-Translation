Generally speaking, the original It is safer if it is farmland, residential, public facilities, or green space parks, and there are basically no migration pathways for pollutants from other surrounding areas. If it is a converted contaminated site, you need to pay attention to the results of soil assessment. (Picture and text unrelated) Visual China/Picture&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Recently, the &quot;poisonous land&quot; dispute between Jiangsu Suzhou Iron and Steel Group Co., Ltd. and Shanghai Lujiazui Financial and Trade Zone Development Co., Ltd. Generate attention. Spending two generations&#39; &quot;six wallets&quot; to buy their first home is a price many ordinary home buyers have to pay. How to avoid buying a &quot;poisonous land&quot;? This has also become a topic of widespread concern. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;my country&#39;s soil pollution laws and regulations were promulgated relatively late. In 2019, the Soil Pollution Prevention and Control Law began to be implemented. Combined with other documents, three situations require soil pollution status investigation: The first is the change of land use to residential, public management and public services (referred to as &quot;one residential, two public&quot;); the second is the construction land plots with soil pollution risks; the third is the change of land use for production and operation of key soil pollution supervision units, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;According to the requirements of laws and regulations such as the Soil Pollution Prevention and Control Law, soil environment investigation reports must be disclosed to the public in accordance with regulations, but the legal provisions on information disclosure are not specific enough. Soil pollution is hidden, and home buyers need to check the land use history. Generally speaking, it is safer if the land was originally farmland, residential, public facilities, or green space park types, and there are basically no other migration pathways for pollutants in the surrounding land. If it is a converted contaminated site, you need to pay attention to the results of soil assessment. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Soil information disclosure is uneven&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Because there are no clear regulations, there are various channels for soil information disclosure, making it difficult to search with one click. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Guo Lei, a staff member of the environmental protection organization &quot;Guangzhou Green Network Environmental Protection Service Center&quot; (hereinafter referred to as Green Network) told the Southern Weekly reporter that our country&#39;s laws do not provide for soil In what channels should the environmental investigation report be made public, what content should be made public, etc. In actual situations, some reports are made public on the websites of real estate developers, and some are published on industry forums of companies commissioned to investigate. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Since 2016, Green Network has regularly collected from hundreds of websites and compiled tens of thousands of reports related to soil pollution investigation and remediation for free public review. However, public awareness of this aggregated information is not high. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The professional nature of information disclosure content also increases the difficulty for users to access it. The public generally searches for the subdivision or developer name, but reports often use parcel numbers provided by the Department of Natural Resources. Moreover, most of the public reports are simplified and lack location diagrams, making it difficult for the public to correspond their property and plot numbers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Southern Weekend reporters searched the Green Network database using &quot;Beijing&quot; as the keyword and found that the vast majority of the 15 preliminary investigation reports displayed on the homepage were only Some are about 2 pages long, including a brief description of basic soil conditions, investigation plans and investigation conclusions; some are as long as 130 pages, or the full text and on-site photos are disclosed in detail. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Guo Lei said that the simplified report lacks data such as sampling point maps and pollutant concentration distribution, making it impossible for outsiders to conduct detailed analysis. It is easy to judge whether the sampling process was standardized based on the photos, but the report did not present sampling photos. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;There is still a big gap in the information disclosure intensity and quality of soil environmental investigation reports compared with air, water, environmental assessment and other reports.&quot; Guo Lei suggested, Specific information disclosure specifications should be formulated and a unified release platform for information disclosure should be established. Especially for residential buildings and schools redeveloped from land used by heavily polluting industries, developers need to disclose detailed information, and home buyers and parents of students must make careful choices. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;How &quot;poisonous land&quot; can be turned into &quot;treasure land&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;If soil restoration is in place, there are many cases where &quot;poisonous land&quot; has been transformed into &quot;treasure land&quot; . &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In 2008, the Beijing Chemical Plant No. 2, located in the southeastern suburbs of Chaoyang District, Beijing, ceased production, and the land was transferred to the State Administration for Residential Land Development. Dr. Yang Jin, chairman of Simple Testing Technology (Shanghai) Co., Ltd., has participated in the soil environment investigation and testing work of this project. Yang Jin introduced that the soil investigation and restoration of this project lasted for many years and cost more than 1 billion yuan. On the land Guanghua New City Community was built and residents will move in at the end of 2018. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Transforming a &quot;poisonous land&quot; into a &quot;treasure land&quot; requires a long process of assessment and restoration. The investigation of soil pollution alone will go through three stages. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The first stage is pollution identification, which is mainly based on data collection, on-site surveys and personnel interviews; if possible pollution sources are found in or around the plot, then Entering the second stage of contamination confirmation, it is divided into preliminary and detailed sampling analysis, and the preparation of a soil pollution status investigation report; the third stage is mainly supplementary sampling and testing to obtain the parameters required to meet risk assessment and soil and groundwater remediation. The investigation work in the first stage can be carried out separately or simultaneously during the second stage investigation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Yang Jin introduced that the sampling density for the preliminary investigation of soil pollution conditions is small, generally a 40m×40m grid layout, which is equivalent to the area of ​​four basketball courts. For a sample, it usually takes 2-3 months from the formulation of the plan to the release of the analysis results. If contaminants are detected in the preliminary investigation, detailed investigation is required. The sampling density is increased to a 20m×20m grid, which is equivalent to the area of ​​a basketball court to collect one sample. Local key areas may be denser. This step is time-consuming. About 3-6 months. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;After the soil pollution status investigation and risk assessment are completed, soil remediation must be carried out. Depending on the land area and remediation goals, the remediation work may take as short as one or two years. , the length may exceed ten years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/22/cb4dd94913.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/22/cb4dd94913.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;259105&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #999999;&quot;>;In July 2022, Hefei, Anhui, at the contaminated soil treatment and restoration site in the former industrial production area of ​​Yaohai District, The staff analyzed the soil at room temperature. Visual China/Picture&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;There are currently more than 100 soil remediation technologies, and there are more than ten commonly used technologies, which can be roughly divided into physical There are three methods: chemical and biological. The technical principle is to transfer, absorb, degrade and transform pollutants in the soil, reducing their concentration to acceptable levels, or converting toxic and harmful pollutants into harmless substances. According to the remediation mode, it can be divided into in-situ and ex-situ remediation. The difference lies in whether the contaminated soil is moved. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The effectiveness of soil remediation also needs to be evaluated. my country implements a soil pollution risk management and restoration list system for construction land. Contaminated plots on the list must pass the review organized by the provincial ecological environment department and meet the established management and control or restoration goals. Only after the risks are controllable can they be removed from the list and developed and utilized. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;It is difficult for the public to judge the quality of reports&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Even if a soil environmental survey has been conducted and the information has been disclosed relatively well, the quality of the reports varies. Qi, the professional threshold is high, and it is difficult for the public to understand. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;These reports are prepared by professional companies and have passed expert review. Let alone the general public, let us look for problems in the reports. In fact, there is no It’s easy to find.” Guo Lei admitted that it is difficult for ordinary residents to judge whether the quality of the report is up to standard. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Pollutants in the soil are different from the atmosphere and water and are not evenly distributed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Gao Jie, secretary-general of Zhongguancun Zhongxin Soil Remediation Industry Technology Innovation Alliance, told Southern Weekend reporters that soil is multi-phase and heterogeneous, and pollutants are underground , invisible to the naked eye. During the soil investigation process, contaminants may not be discovered in time due to factors such as technology and cost constraints. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Soil remediation has certain uncertainties, and there is no guarantee that it will be &quot;repaired&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Yang Jin said that in reality, there is a phenomenon that after soil remediation is completed and then tested, the pollutants still exceed the standard, and even the organic pollutants in some areas &quot;increase as the soil is repaired.&quot; &quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;There are two main types of pollutants in soil - heavy metals and organic matter. Heavy metals have weak mobility and are relatively simple to repair. Generally, there are chemical curing methods, leaching methods, separation methods, etc. Since organic matter has strong mobility, thermal desorption, chemical oxidation or biological remediation methods are generally used. Organic pollutants may migrate with groundwater and other media. The soil extraction process may cause disturbance to underground pollutants, which may cause them to migrate to a wider range. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Gao Jie suggested that awareness of soil pollution prevention and control should be strengthened during the development process. For example, when digging and turning the soil, pay attention to observe whether the color and smell are abnormal, and be equipped with XRF, Rapid screening instruments such as PID can quickly determine whether soil is contaminated. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Supervisory authorities should check things in advance. According to GreenNet statistics, since 2019, land use rights holders of more than 300 plots across the country have been punished by the ecological environment department for failing to conduct soil pollution surveys or risk assessments before redevelopment of the plots. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Even if the reported problems are discovered, the house may have been built by then, and the difficulty of solving the problem has become more complicated.&quot; Guo Lei said that at present, The ecological environment department is improving the supervision system and requires survey companies to file sampling plans in advance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In July 2022, the Ministry of Ecology and Environment issued the &quot;Guidelines for Preliminary Investigation, Supervision and Inspection of Soil Pollution Conditions in Construction Land (Trial)&quot;, stipulating that municipal ecological environment authorities Carry out supervision and inspection on the sampling and analysis work plan, on-site sampling, and laboratory testing and analysis. For investigation reports that have passed the review, the provincial ecological and environmental authorities can organize random inspections. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In addition to supervision by local environmental protection departments, Green Network will also report similar clues discovered. &quot;It is possible that some plots that should have been subject to soil environmental surveys but were not, were not discovered by either us or the environmental protection department,&quot; Guo Lei said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Guo Lei explained that there are two important reasons why soil pollution surveys were not conducted before development: First, soil pollution surveys are not subject to the same regulations as planning permits and construction permits. It is widely known that many developers do not know that soil pollution surveys are required, and legal education and publicity need to be further strengthened. Second, many local ecological environment departments do not fully grasp land change information and need to share information with natural resource departments. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Is it worthwhile to develop highly polluting land plots?&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Yang Jin observed that when the real estate industry was booming in the past few years, land plots in highly polluting industries Also very popular. &quot;Even if soil environmental investigation and restoration take several years and cost hundreds of millions or even billions, it is still difficult to dampen the enthusiasm of developers because of the huge returns.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left ;&quot;>;Nowadays, local governments and developers are also reflecting on whether it is worth paying such a large cost to repair a difficult and uncertain soil in order to develop residential buildings and bear subsequent risks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The &quot;Regulations on the Prevention and Control of Soil Pollution in Jiangsu Province&quot; that will be implemented on September 1, 2022 stipulates that non-ferrous metal mining and processing, non-ferrous metal smelting, and petroleum shall be strictly controlled. Land with serious soil pollution in mining, petroleum processing, chemical industry, coking, electroplating, tanning, pesticides, lead batteries, steel, hazardous waste utilization and disposal and other industries should not be planned as residential areas, schools, kindergartens, hospitals, Land used for nursing homes and sanatoriums can be used to expand ecological space. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Of course, even if you are unfortunate enough to live in a house built on a soil-contaminated land, residents do not need to panic too much. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Guo Lei said that if you live on a high floor, you are far away from the surface. Even if there are volatile and semi-volatile organic compounds in the soil, when you reach the high floor, The concentration is also very low. For houses built on &quot;poisonous land&quot;, the basements, gardens and green belts will be most affected. The gas after the pollutants volatilize will slowly penetrate into the underground space and accumulate there. It is not recommended to stay in the basement for a long time, and gardens and green belts are prone to direct contact with contaminated soil. In windy and dusty weather, residents should wear masks. If they are well protected, health risks can be greatly reduced. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 22 Nov 2023 14:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[四川“废弃神话公园”，藏着“七仙女”与“历代帝王”]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260960]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-22 13:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;On November 9, 2023, the ancient exhibition with &quot;Chinese history and culture&quot; as the core theme The famous scenic spot has many statues of emperors and generals designed in the China Progress Garden.&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/20/eccbc4710d.JPG&quot; border= &quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;719&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/20/eccbc4710d.JPG&quot; data-key=&quot;258918&quot;>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On November 9, 2023, the ancient famous Tianxia Scenic Spot with &quot;Chinese History and Culture&quot; as the core theme was designed in the Huaxia Process Garden There are many statues of emperors and generals. &lt;p>; A man-made &quot;cultural heritage&quot; with a sense of absurdity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;On November 9, 2023, in Zhongjiang County, Deyang City, Sichuan, the gate of the ancient famous Tianxia Scenic Spot was closed.&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias /image/23/11/20/a490834d30.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;810&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11 /20/a490834d30.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;258919&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;November 9, 2023, Zhongjiang County, Deyang City, Sichuan, The gates of the ancient famous Tianxia Scenic Spot are closed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The main body of this large-scale scenic spot is built in Fengdian Town, Zhongjiang County, with a planned land area of ​​more than 10,000 acres. In 2014, the developer of the scenic spot brought the project to this small county town, claiming that it would help local people get rich. Unexpectedly, there was insufficient funds in the first year of construction. Despite being in arrears with tens of millions of project funds, the scenic spot still barely opened for business at the end of 2019. At the opening, colorful balloons floated in the air, and hundreds of people watched the red-faced Guan Gong perform his machete on the red carpet. The scene was lively. However, the scenic area&#39;s business has been bleak since then. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;On November 9, 2023, weeds grew on both sides of the road in the ancient Mingtianxia Scenic Area.&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23 /11/20/f7a677405f.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;719&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/20/f7a677405f .JPG&quot; data-key=&quot;258920&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On November 9, 2023, the roads in the ancient Mingtianxia Scenic Area were overgrown with weeds. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;On November 9, 2023, a &quot;Terracotta Warriors&quot; standing in front of a chariot looked dilapidated due to long-term disrepair.&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com /cms/medias/image/23/11/20/cfb05ce8ae.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;719&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image /23/11/20/cfb05ce8ae.JPG&quot; data-key=&quot;258921&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;November 9, 2023, Yizun Station The &quot;terracotta warriors and horses&quot; in front of the chariot appear dilapidated due to disrepair over time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;On November 9, 2023, the &quot;terracotta warriors and horses&quot; have solemn expressions, as if people have traveled from Deyang to Xi&#39;an in an instant.&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/ cms/medias/image/23/11/20/5ed1bad471.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;719&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/ 23/11/20/5ed1bad471.JPG&quot; data-key=&quot;258922&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;November 9, 2023, &quot;Terracotta Warriors and Horses&quot; His expression was solemn, as if people were transported from Deyang to Xi&#39;an in an instant. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;On November 9, 2023, hundreds of life-size &quot;terracotta warriors and horses&quot; were arranged neatly in the scenic spot.&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/ medias/image/23/11/20/aa9be155e6.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;810&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 11/20/aa9be155e6.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;258923&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On November 9, 2023, hundreds of life-size statues The &quot;terracotta warriors and horses&quot; are neatly arranged in the scenic spot. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In addition to encountering the epidemic, there are traces of the failure of &quot;Ancient Famous World&quot;.

In order to let tourists experience the feeling of &quot;pointing the country&quot;, the scenic spot has also built thousands of replicas of terracotta warriors and horses. Accompanying the &quot;terracotta warriors and horses&quot; are nearly 500 &quot;statues of emperors from past dynasties&quot;. However, the imperial appearance, which is far from the common perception, and the text introduction full of errors, made the visitors laugh and cry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;img alt=&quot;On November 9, 2023, the pond where the statue of the Eight Immortals Crossing the Sea in the ancient famous Tianxia Scenic Spot is already a pool of stagnant water.&quot; src=&quot;http:// images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/20/8a924b14c2.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;719&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/ cms/medias/image/23/11/20/8a924b14c2.JPG&quot; data-key=&quot;258924&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;November 2023 On the 9th, the pond where the statue of the Eight Immortals Crossing the Sea in the ancient famous Tianxia Scenic Spot was turned into a pool of stagnant water. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;On November 9, 2023, a statue of an emperor surrounded by wild grass almost as tall as a person.&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image /23/11/20/b03c44e1a4.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;810&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/20 /b03c44e1a4.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;258925&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On November 9, 2023, a statue was surrounded by weeds almost as tall as a person. statue of the emperor. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The scenic tour line is 19 kilometers long, and sculptures are scattered in more than 20 scenic spots. Some tourists once complained on the review software, which is equivalent to forcing people to spend money to take a sightseeing bus. In early November 2023, a Southern Weekend reporter sat on a villager&#39;s motorcycle and visited less than 10 scenic spots, which took more than 3 hours. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;After the scenic spot was temporarily closed in June 2022, the &quot;terracotta warriors and horses&quot;, &quot;seven fairies&quot; and &quot;emperors and generals&quot; were left in the barren mountains and ridges without anyone. Take care of it and live next to wind, rain, weeds, insects and ants. When Southern Weekend reporters visited the scenic spot, they only met two or three villagers in the scenic spot. The local villagers did not embark on the road to wealth. Instead, they were owed many years of land rent. Now the villagers are re-cultivation in many places in the scenic area and have planted rapeseed, a local cash crop. They said that this year, rapeseed can be sold for 3 yuan per pound. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;On November 9, 2023, an aerial photo was taken of the ancient famous Tianxia Scenic Area.

Under the promotion of the scenic area promoters, perhaps investors believe that the scenic area has a bright future. Southern Weekend reporters learned from multiple judgments and on-site construction personnel that the investors attracted by the scenic spot tend to be older. Some retired men were defrauded of 210,000 yuan to buy &quot;health products&quot; and then invested tens of thousands more yuan in scenic spots. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;On November 9, 2023, some local residents occasionally came to the park to hang out.&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23 /11/20/cdcad5f48d.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;810&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/20/cdcad5f48d .jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;258927&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On November 9, 2023, some local residents occasionally came to the park to hang out. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The scenes of abandoned scenic spots were spread through the Internet, attracting some explorers.

Photo by Southern Weekend reporter Weng Huan&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhongjiang County in Sichuan Province was once the county with the largest number of people who have not been lifted out of poverty, apart from the national and provincial poverty-stricken counties in Sichuan. There is a scenic spot in the mountains here, spanning three counties and three towns, with a planned area of ​​15.3 square kilometers, equivalent to the size of 15 Forbidden City. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is known as &quot;the only imperial cultural area in the world&quot; and includes nearly 2,000 statues, including nearly 500 portraits of emperors and generals, thousands of imitation &quot;terracotta warriors and horses&quot;, and more than 3 meters high. Images such as &quot;Seven Fairies&quot; and &quot;Eight Immortals&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But it was not completed. No one cared about it for many years. The statue gradually peeled off and faded, disappearing in the grass. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In May 2021, someone asked on the official website of &quot;Ask Politics in Sichuan&quot;: &quot;The ancient Fengdian Town in Zhongjiang, Sichuan is famous all over the world. What is the reason why it has not been completed for many years?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fengdian Town is famous all over the world. The town government responded in November that the capital chain of the scenic spot builder was broken, with about 28 million yuan in arrears in project payments and more than 80 million yuan in arrears in financing, involving more than 2,700 people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What is even more surprising is that the judgment document website states that the legal representative of the developer was sentenced at the end of 2019 for illegally occupying agricultural land for the construction of a scenic spot. While he was on probation, he was still actively soliciting investment. In June 2022, the scenic spot announced its temporary closure. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;How was such a behemoth built? Who is responsible for its failure? &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;&quot;Terracotta Warriors and Horses from Sichuan&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; The ancient famous Tianxia Scenic Area is affiliated to Deyang City. According to promotional materials, the project was launched in 2014 with a total planned investment of approximately 3.1 billion yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Its location is relatively remote, more than an hour&#39;s drive from the center of Deyang and surrounding cities, such as Chengdu and Guanghan. Drive from the Fengdian section exit of Zhongjiang County on the Hurong Expressway and turn right. You will see 9 golden bull elephant sculptures, which are the main entrance of the scenic spot. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;The tour loop is 19 kilometers long. Welcome to take the sightseeing bus.&quot; A line of golden characters at the main entrance reminds tourists of the scale of the scenic spot. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The main entrance is built in imitation of ancient city walls, with couplets in red letters on a gold background hanging on both sides: North, south, east, west, there is no other place in the world, but this place has existed in the world throughout the ages. After the scenic spot was temporarily closed, the gates were locked and items in the ticket room were smashed. Nearby villagers gather under the &quot;golden elephant&quot; to chat, and occasionally give directions to curious tourists from out of town. &quot;You can climb over the wall.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Beside the Jade Dragon Gate at the entrance of the scenic spot, the Fengdian Town Government posted a notice in March 2023, warning tourists not to enter the scenic spot in any way, because the current infrastructure is incomplete and there are major safety risks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Someone opened a trail from the left side of Jade Dragon Gate. If you walk forward for a few minutes against the weeds more than 1 meter high, you will see a statue of an emperor more than 2 meters high. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;The statue of the emperor in the grass.

Photographed by Southern Weekend reporter Weng Huan&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors are making CALL online. Qin Emperor and Han Wu invite you to point out the country together.&quot; According to the scenic spot promotion, there are nearly 500 statues here, including Emperor Gaozong of the Tang Dynasty, Wu Zetian, Taizu of the Song Dynasty, etc. The emperors of modernization also include the leaders of the &quot;Five Hus and Sixteen Kingdoms&quot; and the &quot;Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hong Hai participated in the construction of about 100 emperor statues from the Tang Dynasty to the Qing Dynasty and stayed in the scenic spot for more than two months. He recalled to Southern Weekend reporters on the phone that the developer was inspired by &quot;Pictures of Emperors of the Past&quot; by Yan Liben, a painter from the Tang Dynasty, and wanted to present the emperors of the past dynasties in the form of sculptures. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The statue is placed in a cement field called &quot;Chinese Historical Process Park&quot;. The scenic spot hopes to allow tourists to appreciate five thousand years of Chinese culture by displaying the emperor&#39;s style and introducing his life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But if tourists look carefully, they will laugh. For example, Emperor Gong of the Sui Dynasty Yang You (605-619) only lived 15 years old, but the statue of Yang You in the scenic area has a thick long beard and wrinkles on his face, making him look like a mature uncle. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The text introduction is not rigorous enough. For example, in the introduction to Song Taizu, &quot;Zhao Kuangyin practiced martial arts when he was young, and first joined Guo Wei, Taizu of the Northern Zhou Dynasty. Later, he followed Chai Rong, Emperor Shizong of the Zhou Dynasty, to fight in various places, and made many military exploits. There were commanders and envoys in front of the palace, and he mastered ice boxing.&quot; Not only is the sentence incomplete, it also contains typos. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this regard, Hong Hai said that he and his team were not involved in the coloring and text introduction of the statue. The appearance of the emperor was also built based on the drawings provided by the scenic spot. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He introduced that the raw materials of these imperial statues are mainly steel bars and cement, which are cheaper than copper. He did not disclose the total price, citing commercial confidentiality. Due to lack of maintenance and management, hundreds of emperors are now living with dead grass. Under the sun and rain, the acrylic paint on many statues has faded, exposing gray cement, and steel bars are also exposed at the joints of the bases. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Not far from the emperor&#39;s statue, nearly a thousand &quot;terracotta warriors and horses&quot; are quietly guarding in the mud. These &quot;terracotta warriors and horses&quot; imitate armored warrior warriors, wearing battle uniforms, armor, and hair tied in high buns. However, compared with the various terracotta warriors and horses in the Qin Shihuang Mausoleum in Xi&#39;an, the &quot;Terracotta Warriors and Horses Sichuan&quot; are rough in workmanship, lack details in their expressions and costumes, and are weak in momentum. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The scenic spot once attracted tourists with the gimmick that &quot;you can see the Terracotta Warriors and Horses without leaving Sichuan&quot;. Now these replicas are surrounded by moss and wild grass on the edge of the mountain forest, and some have white thatch inserted into their hands. &quot;Qin Shihuang&quot;, who was wearing a dragon robe, had a red ribbon &quot;praying for peace&quot; wrapped around his bun. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is a sign under the feet of &quot;Qin Shihuang&quot; that reads: &quot;No destruction of property!&quot; However, due to no one taking care of them, these imitations have faded and have cracks in many places. Some &quot;Kneeling Shooting Figurines&quot; were cut off at the waist, and many &quot;Warrior Figurines&quot; lost their arms and even their heads. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In early November 2023, Southern Weekend reporters also saw giant sculptures placed in scenic spots such as Seven Fairies, Eight Immortals Crossing the Sea, Mother Earth, Chang&#39;e Flying to the Moon, Queens of the Four Seasons, and Zhuzi Square. They are three to four meters high, but the workmanship is rough when seen up close. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the publicity, there are more than 20 scenic spots in the scenic area, such as the Drunken Concubine, the Sifang Wealth Saint, the Yue Laotai, the Nine Fox Fairy Cave, and the Cowherd and the Weaver Girl. &quot;Their huge lineup and magnificent momentum are truly unmatched throughout the ages. Unparalleled.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;While making emperor statues for Gu Ming Tian Xia, Hong Hai saw the terracotta warriors and horses and other statues being moved into the scenic spot. He has been engaged in the sculpture industry for nearly 20 years and lamented, &quot;I have never seen anything that requires so many sculptures.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the publicity of the scenic spot, the ancient name of the world is based on the five thousand years of Chinese civilization as the core theme, integrating the Chinese cultural story line into the natural ecology and cultural landscape, allowing the story to connect, empower and cast the soul of the landscape. Thus forming an internal logical connection. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;Driving local people to get rich&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Developers came to this town in 2014. According to (2019) Sichuan 0623 Xingchu No. 409 Judgment, on March 7, 2014, Sichuan Gumingtianxia Investment Management Co., Ltd. signed an investment cooperation framework agreement with the Fengdian Town Government of Zhongjiang County. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhongjiang County is a major agricultural county in the hilly areas of Sichuan. The food crops grown are mainly rice, rapeseed and wheat. Fengdian Town under its jurisdiction is also a typical remote agricultural town. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The agreement stipulates that Gumingtianxia Investment Company will invest 370 million yuan to build a new wintersweet viewing base and agricultural tourism project in Fengdian Town. The Fengdian Town Government agrees to provide its company with the land for this project within the ownership and land scope of Huangping Village and Hejia Village Committees. The area shall be based on the lease area signed between the company and the village, but it shall not change the land without authorization. Nature of land use. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the investment cooperation framework agreement obtained by Southern Weekend reporters, the two parties also agreed that Gumingtianxia Investment Company should register and establish a Zhongjiang branch within the jurisdiction of Zhongjiang County. After the project is completed and put into operation, taxes will be paid in the territory. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On August 21, 2014, Zhou Lizhu registered and established Sichuan Guming Tianxia Tourism Development Co., Ltd. in the name of her daughter Zhou Xiaxia (in 2016, the legal representative became Zhou Lizhu, hereinafter referred to as &quot; &quot;Anciently Famous&quot;), with a registered capital of 100 million yuan, and Zhou Lizhu holds 100% of the shares. The registered address of Gu Ming Tian Xia is No. 5, Huangping Village, Fengdian Town. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The main entrance of the scenic spot is built in Huangping Village. Southern Weekend reporters learned from many Huangping Village villagers that rents in scenic spots range from 400 yuan/mu/year to 1,000 yuan/mu/year. One villager said that the land on the mountain was basically unable to grow food and was originally abandoned with no income. The scenic spot also hired local people to do cleaning, maintenance and other work, providing some jobs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The scenic spot also mentioned in its publicity that it will &quot;drive local people to become rich.&quot; The economy of Zhongjiang County is relatively backward. Information disclosed by the Sichuan Provincial Poverty Alleviation and Immigration Bureau shows that there were 92,500 poor people in Zhongjiang County in 2014. From 2011 to 2014, the province allocated 65.642 million yuan in special financial poverty alleviation funds for Zhongjiang County. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The investment cooperation framework agreement stipulates that Gumingtianxia plans to invest 370 million yuan, and the project construction period will be 4 years and will be completed at the end of December 2018. After completion, it can achieve annual sales revenue of 200 million yuan and tax revenue of 20 million yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhou Lizhu is from Dazhou, Sichuan Province. Local media in Dazhou reported his story twice. In 1980, Zhou Lizhu worked as a cashier in a mining company in Dazhou, earning more than 60 yuan a month. But he felt &quot;so tired&quot; that he resigned after five months and set up a leather factory. Zhou Lizhu was only 17 years old at the time and was called the &quot;Doll Factory Manager&quot; by her 10 workers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;Mr. Zhou Lizhu, who has been in business for a long time, has a heroic spirit between his brows, and his beard makes his outline more subtle and elegant.&quot; According to the scenic spot promotion article, Zhou Lizhu has since He has worked in communication equipment, steel manufacturing, real estate, tourism and other industries, and has also studied in the EMBA class of Xiamen University and Peking University Guanghua School of Management. However, according to the verdict, Zhou Lizhu only had a junior high school education. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to &quot;well-known entrepreneur&quot;, another label attached to Zhou Lizhu is &quot;philanthropist&quot;. According to the &quot;Dazhou Evening News&quot; report, Zhou Lizhu once used part of Gumingtianxia&#39;s operating income to establish the &quot;Love Weekly Special Fund&quot;. In October 2015, he donated 200 cherry blossom saplings worth 100,000 yuan to his hometown of Dazhu County, Dazhou City. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;It took four years of construction before it was found to be illegal&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;According to the Zhongjiang County Government website, in August 2016, the first phase of the Gumingtianxia project was registered, and the scenic area is planned to cover an area of ​​about 3,000 acres. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Southern weekend reporters obtained the notice of investment project filing of the scenic spot to the ancient names of the world as investors.

During the validity period, if important changes have occurred (including one of the project investment entities, construction locations, main construction content, changes in product technology solutions, and the expected changes in the total investment or construction scale of the project, the project unit shall apply for re -application for re -application Filing. In October 2016, the ancient names of the world applied for re -filing. The original plan to use the land of 2,400 acres was 3590.5 acres. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Another document obtained by reporters from the Southern Weekend show that in August 2016, Zhongjiang County Tourism Bureau issued a letter to the ancient world world, &quot;Principles agree with your company to invest in the development of&quot; Ancient World Tourism in Fengdian Town Travel &#39;Project &quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In the fourth year, the scenic spot was found illegal occupation of agricultural land. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The aforementioned judgment stated, &quot;In addition to planting agricultural planting projects such as plums and begonias on the rent of the land, the company has not obtained any construction land approval and procedures. During the year, change the nature of the original rental land and start construction construction projects. &amp; Nbsp; &quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In 2018, the original Deyang City Land and Resources Bureau and the Zhongjiang County Forest Public Security Bureau led the identification. The area of ​​140.1595 acres involved an area of ​​18,360 square meters (about 27.54 acres) of the forest land. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The proportion of these two parts in the scenic area is actually very small, accounting for about 4.67%of the land area of ​​the filing plan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In December 2019, the Zhongjiang County People&#39;s Court ruled that the ancient names of the world committed illegal occupation of agricultural land and fined 50,000 yuan; Gold 10,000 yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In the four years involved in illegal construction, the scenic area has been supported by the local government many times. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; According to the public account of the scenic area, in February 2016, the then Secretary of the Zhongjiang County Party Committee brought the delegation to the scenic area for guidance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; According to the official website of the Zhongjiang County Government, on August 9, 2016, the former deputy county chief presided over the promotion meeting of the ancient world project construction project, and listened to the report of the project planning units, the report of the construction of project investors and related related reports, and related related to the construction of the project investor construction. Suggestions of the person in charge of the department. The meeting requested that the relevant departments should work together to coordinate and solve the problems existing in the construction of the Xiangyu, and ensure that the construction items are promoted smoothly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Liao Xing, one of the original management of the scenic area, told the southern weekend that the scenic area did not know the basic farmland at the beginning of construction. Since 2014, Zhou Liyu came to work in the ancient world. He was mainly responsible for the management of the project. After being arrears of wages, he resigned in 2021. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In January 2017, the State Council issued the &quot;Opinions on Strengthening the Protection of Cultivation Land and Improved Balance&quot; to implement the most stringent arable land protection system. According to the news of the Sichuan Provincial Department of Land and Resources in September 2018, the Deyang City Bureau of Land and Resources has paid close attention to the protection of cultivated land. At that time, the city had conducted 685 dynamic inspections in that year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Liao Xing and the above -mentioned investment promotion personnel said that after the ancient world and Zhou Lizhu were sentenced and fined, the local government had adjusted the basic farmland and forest land occupied by the scenic spot into general land. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; According to the promotional information of the scenic area, on April 10, 2020, the Standing Committee of the Zhongjiang County Party Committee, the Minister of Propaganda, the director of the County Cultural and Tourism Bureau, and the deputy director of the County Natural Resources Bureau came to the ancient famous Tianxia Scenic Area to guide the work and put forward opinions Or suggest that Zhou Liyu and others accompanied. &lt;/p>; &lt;H4>; The establishment of the scenic spot owed 20 million &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; At the end of 2015, the construction team began to enter the field. However, the construction of the scenic spot at that time was undergoing violations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; A judgment shows that in August 2015, Chongqing Jinglin Industry (Group) Co., Ltd. signed a contract with the ancient names of the world, agreed to undertake the construction of the office building, hotel, and commercial street anti -corrosion cabin project. However, due to the quasi -construction procedures of the office building in ancient names, the competent authorities prohibited the construction, and Chongqing Seiko Industry stopped the construction of the office building. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Since then, the two parties have signed a contract and agreed to contract the road road projects in the scenic area to Chongqing Jingxin Industry. After June 2019, Chongqing Jinglin Industry completed the construction of road bases. Because of the ancient famous world, the construction drawings were not provided and the construction of construction was not connected. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Wang Rong was one of the management of the scenic spot. He told reporters from the south weekend that because the scenic area is a tourist project that local government attracts investment, the policy may be opened a little, so they start construction first. formalities. At present, Wang Rong is still arrears of about 100,000 yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; But Wang Rong acknowledged that at the beginning of construction, the scenic spot violated the relevant provisions of temporary land use. &quot;There is no newspapers and reports.&quot; &lt;/P>; &lt;p>; At the same time, the ancient names are facing the situation of lack of funds. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; According to the above judgment, in October 2016, the ancient world&#39;s world was arrears to Chongqing Jingxin Industry, and admitted that the arrears of the project funds were 26.158 million yuan and the deposit was 100,000 yuan. After refunding the security deposit, the ancient world has been arrears of engineering funds. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; A reporter from the Southern Weekend learned to many construction parties that they and the ancient famous world agreed to &quot;set funds first and then settlement.&quot; Sichuan people Li Chengwu is in his fifties. For more than 30 years, he has mainly contracted the construction of earth and stone projects. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; He saw that there were two companies under Zhou Li&#39;s name, and he thought that his strength was good. By the end of 2016, Li Chengwu counted the account, and the cushion had been nearly 5 million yuan. At this time, Zhou Lizhen still couldn&#39;t pay. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Near the New Year, Jiang Tao, who is responsible for infrastructure projects, and Yang Tinghong, who is doing the green sand and slab material paving project. Zhou Lizhu&#39;s accounts owed to them were 2.9 million and 270,000, respectively. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Later, Li Chengwu and others began to report the situation to the government. On September 1, 2017, at the Labor Security Bureau of Zhongjiang County, the ancient name of the world promised Li Chengwu to pay off the project funds before August 30, 2018. After the signature of Zhou Liyu, he wrote the word &quot;agree&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; At present, there are 88 &quot;ancient names in the world&quot; where Li Chengwu and others are located, including construction teams such as garden greening, doors and windows, hardening roads, and green slate for the scenic area. In November 2023, a boss who made doors and windows for the scenic spot counted a data in the group. At least 22 construction teams were arrears of engineering funds, wages and margin for about 20 million yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The owner of multiple construction team told reporters from the southern weekend that the reason why the construction team continued to enter the market in 2017 was because the quotation of ancient names was 5%-10%higher than that of the market. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; According to the referee document network, since the second half of 2017, the construction party sued Zhou Lizhen and the ancient world in the world and won the lawsuit. Several plaintiffs applied for compulsory enforcement, but the court failed to find any property and property clues under the name of the person. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Not only the construction party, the villagers from Huangping Village, Fengdian Town from 2017, will not get the rent of the scenic area. The above -mentioned scenic spot investment personnel said that about 90 % of the scenic spots were built in Fengdian Town, and so far owed about 9 million yuan in land rent. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;img alt = &quot;The scenic area across three counties and three towns, which is comparable to 15 Forbidden City.

However, according to the scenic spot, the total investment of the plan is about 3.1 billion yuan, which is divided into four -phase engineering construction scenic spot. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;He has a lot of things, engage in leather factories, sell steel, sell communications, and also engage in crowdfunding.&quot; Dazhou native Qiu Song is Zhou Lizhen&#39;s fellow, and he recalled to reporters from the south weekend. Lizhen opened a company in Dazhou, and then went to Fengdian to run the scenic spot. Qiu Song made a steel frame structure for the scenic area, and now it is also owed about 1 million yuan by the ancient world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; A Dazhou person brought Zhou Liyu to court in 2018. According to the judgment, since December 2013, Zhou Lizhen has a total of 1.2 million yuan from the plaintiff&#39;s father&#39;s father, and will compensate the three houses in Tongchuan District, Dazhou City. However, the plaintiff found that the owner of the mortgaged property was not Zhou Liyu. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Li Chengwu also heard Zhou Liyu said that he had developed real estate projects in Dazhou. In order to collect debt, Li Chengwu arrived several times to find Zhou Lizhen&#39;s real estate. &quot;Later, I knew it was upset. He had no projects in Dazhou to draw money.&quot; &lt;/P>; &lt;p>; Li Chengwu has also been to Hainan, because Zhou Lizheng claims that there are 16 houses in a certain real estate in Sanya. Several sets of repayment. After he went, he found that the person who guarded the real estate was Zhou Lizhen&#39;s fellow, and the real estate had nothing to do with Zhou Liyu. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Wang Rong said that Zhou Lizhen had a financing company in Dazhou, and the money of raising 3 points of interest was borrowed to others with 5 or 8 points. But later, bad debts could not be collected. In addition, he squandered partly, which led to hundreds of millions of yuan in investors. So Zhou Lizheng thought that he could go to the scenic spot, and claimed that the financing funds were invested in the construction of the scenic spot. &quot;Write a promise to those who owe money. The scenic area will give you a shares. After the park is opened, give you dividends every year.&quot; &lt;/P>; &lt;p>; &quot;Disassembling the east wall to make up the west wall, the capital hole is getting bigger and bigger.&quot; On the weekend, the reporter learned from an official in Fengdian Town as an investor that Zhou Liyu initially took about 40 million yuan to build the scenic spot. After the money was used, he went to raise funds in Mianyang, Deyang, Suining, Chengdu, Nanchong and other places. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Tianyancha shows that from 2017-2018, Zhou Lizhen registered companies related to ancient worlds in Deyang, Chengdu, Mianyang, and Suining, respectively. According to the Fengdian Town Government, the financing funds arrears in ancient names reached more than 80 million yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Liao Xing said that he did not know the source of Zhou Li&#39;s funds. He mentioned that because of road construction, the scenic area had received a road subsidy of about 1 million yuan in the local government, but in addition, he did not enjoy other subsidies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Jiang Tao, who is responsible for infrastructure engineering, said that he had seen two tourist bus parked in the scenic area in 2017, and was an investor in the ancient world. &quot;Luck the money for the elderly.&quot; &lt;/P>; &lt;p>; On the referee document network, there are 3 civil loan disputes related to ancient famous worlds. The three judgments show that in March, May, and June 2019, the ancient world borrowed 100,000, 10,000, and 100,000, respectively, and all promised an annual interest rate of 24%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Coincidentally, these three plaintiffs are older, and they are 71 years old, 60, and 63 years old. Two of them are Mianyang, one is from Deyang. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; On the blog Chinese website, an investor who visited the scenic area in October 2018 recorded the visit. At that time, the construction of the scenic spot was initially completed. The promotion staff said that the scenic spot was built by Zhou Liyu. The original funds were sufficient. However, due to the continuous rise in raw materials and industrial prices in recent years, the funds have occurred, so they borrowed money from the people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The investor saw a retired elderly in his seventy -year -old retired elderly who voted for 30,000. The old man had been deceived by 210,000 for buying &quot;health products&quot;. Seeing the old man believed in Zhou Lizhu so much, the investor &quot;voted a little&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; On July 13, 2019, the ancient name of the world also announced that it was listed in the Tianfu (Sichuan) joint equity trading center with a code of 610161. Tianfu Stock Exchange Center is a regional equity market operating institution that provides financing channels for small and medium -sized enterprises. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; According to the above three judgments, by January 2020, the ancient world&#39;s world failed to pay interest on the three plaintiffs as agreed, nor could they repay the principal. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Where did Zhou Lizhen&#39;s money spent? Liao Xing said that the money was invested in the project, and the project funds were not paid all, but it also ended. For example, he said that regardless of transportation and installation fees, the production cost of each emperor&#39;s statue is about 10,000 yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Dan Wang Rong said that before 2017, the investment in the scenic spot in the scenic spot of the ancient world was not more than 5 million yuan. &quot;At that time, the government did not ask for capital inspection. In the end, he couldn&#39;t get a penny.&quot; &lt;/P>; &lt;p>; Li Chengwu heard Zhou Lizhu said that the scenic area was originally planned to open in May 2017. But it was not until the end of 2019 that it was officially operated. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Liao Xing said that the company&#39;s capital chain was broken because the scenic area was affected by the epidemic, and there was no income. &quot;After repairing the road, planting trees, the project was all there, and he didn&#39;t take it away.&quot; He felt that Zhou Lizheng was &quot;the person who wanted to do things.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Wang Rong believes that Zhou Liyu is a guise to circle money outside the scenic area, and he is not serious about making scenic spots. &quot;Except for the statue, the tourists will not come for the second time.&quot; &lt;/P>; &lt;p>; Liao Xing also had doubts about the development of the scenic area. &quot;Indeed, the plan is too big.&quot; He had received other companies where the scenic area visited, and the other party told him that to complete the planning of the scenic spot, at least it would be 1 billion yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In addition to the &quot;Terracotta Warriors&quot;, the ancient names of the world originally planned to build a Zen Medical Kangyang Ecological Park, low -altitude sports base, Huaxia History and Culture Research Travel Base, Grand Theater, Ancient Shaolin Temple and other attractions. Liao Xing said that the large purpose of the scenic area was to retain tourists overnight, and tourists lived before they lived. However, until the scene of the scenic area was closed, the ancient names have not yet built a hotel. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In fact, the scenic spot is not much attractive to tourists. In the East Square, the reporter from the Southern Weekend saw several discarded tickets with a fare of 98 yuan. There are 20 evaluations of the scenic spot in the public comment. Most of them are talked about high charges. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;img alt = &quot;The imitation&quot; Terracotta Warriors and Horses &quot;here are as many as thousands of lords. /23/11/22/67491062de.jpeg &quot;border =&quot; 0 &quot;width =&quot; 1080 &quot;height =&quot; 810 &quot;data-src =&quot; // Images.infzm.com/ms/medias/23/11/22 /67491062de.jpeg &quot;data-key =&quot; 259130 &quot;>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style =&quot; color: #999999; text-align: center; &quot;>; There are thousands of imitation&quot; Terracotta Warriors &quot;. Southern Weekend reporter Weng Yan &lt;/p>; &lt;H4>; During the suspension, he still ran around &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; During the three years of probation, Zhou Liyu was still investing. The Fengdian Town Government stated in November 2021 that it is actively urging the ancient world investors to raise funds and financing to resolve debt problems. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; According to the promotion of the scenic area, in December 2020, Zhou Liyu signed a strategic cooperation agreement on behalf of the Scenic Area and the Chengdu Tourism Association Travel Agency Branch at the 2020 China (Sichuan) tourist scenic spot and the cultural and creative industry innovation development expo. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;I have to do everything possible to repay your funds as soon as possible.&quot; In early 2022, Zhou Lizheng wrote a letter to the investment member. The letter mentioned that, in response to the &quot;investment member contract expires&quot;, under the guidance of the Zhongjiang County Party Committee, the County People&#39;s Government, and the relevant departments of the superior, the company is vigorously promoting the investment promotion work and adopting project implant cooperation + equity cooperation. Mode increases the hematopoietic function. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In June 2022, the scenic area announced the temporary closing of the park. In July, Li Chengwu went to the office to find Zhou Liyu and saw the other party talk to two three investors in the reception room. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The office of the ancient world is located in the &quot;ancient famous courtyard&quot; in the courtyard style. When a reporter from the Southern Weekend visited the &quot;Ancient Famous Courtyard&quot; in early November 2023, the office was empty. The leaflets with yellowish and wrinkled scenic spots were blown into the corner by the wind and rain. There were sheep dung and insect corpses everywhere on the ground. It seemed that the yard had been deserted for a while. The reception room, financial room and other office areas borrowed a piece of wolf. The overthrow -pushed office cabinets, crushed glass everywhere, and scattered paper showed fierce conflict traces. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The feet of &quot;Four Seasons Girls&quot; are another office place in the ancient world. Nowadays, the renderings of the scenic area and a calligraphy of the scenic area are hung in the room. It is likely that there are also conflicts here. The jewelry cabinet of sterling silver bracelets and the natural Gobi red agate was broken, and the empty jewelry box and price were signed to the ground. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; According to the Zhongjiang County Government Network, on the morning of July 23, 2022, the Standing Committee of the County Party Committee, Minister of Propaganda, and Chairman of the County Federation of Trade Unions went to Fengdian Town to hold a &quot;Ancient World&quot; petition stable work site coordination meeting. The Bureau, the County Cultural and Travel Bureau, the County Natural Resources Bureau, the county and other departments and other departments coordinated the meeting. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In September of the same year, the news of Zhou Lizhen appeared last time in the public account of the scenic spot. In the Mid -Autumn Festival congratulations, he continued to convey to the outside world&#39;s determination to develop forward, saying that he would &quot;fight the tough battles of attracting investment.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The public account of the scenic spot left an investment call, and the contact person told the southern weekend reporter that he was mainly responsible for updating the public account and marketing of the scenic spot. &quot;Big Investors&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;The investment scenic spot is large and the return cycle is very slow. If the natural endowment is average, it is difficult to find the investor. Other scenic spots also have bankruptcy. Things. &quot;The contact claims to have resigned at the end of 2019. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The reporter from the Southern Weekend learned from a number of debtors that at the end of 2022, Zhou Lizhen was admitted to the hospital. At that time, Zhou Lizhen was 56 years old. But Wang Rong believes that Zhou Lizhen is to hide the news of debt. On November 11, 2023, a reporter from the Southern Weekend dialed Zhou Lizhen&#39;s mobile phone number, and the other party denied that he was Zhou Lizhu. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; According to the above -mentioned scenic spot investment personnel and Fengdian town officials, the scenic spot has not been found. In early November 2023, the &amp; nbsp at the entrance of the scenic spot; &quot;Chang&#39;e Running Moon&quot; has been repeatedly cultivated like near and on both sides of the main entrance, and the villagers planted rapeseed rapeseed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;span style = &quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>; • &lt;/span>; &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_gb2312, stkaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>; (&quot;>; ( At the request of the interviewees, Honghai, Wang Rong, and Liao Xing in the Wenwen were a pseudonym.) &lt;/Span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 22 Nov 2023 11:55:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[从喝无糖茶到内卷茶叶，年轻人又爱杯泡茶了？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261035]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;i>; 2023-11-22 11:00:00 &lt;/i>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>; &lt;img src = &quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 11/21/604305F84ECECBD8DA5F7176dc8f4C18.jpeg &quot;Border =&quot; 0 &quot;style =&quot; opacity: 1; &quot;width =&quot; 1080 &quot;height =&quot; 736 &quot;data-src =&quot; // images.infzm.com/ CMS/Medias/Image/ 23/11/21/604305F84ECECBD8DA5F7176DC8F4C18.JPEG &quot;Data-key =&quot; 259011 &quot;>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style =&quot; color: #999999; text-align: center; &quot;>; &lt;span>; (Visual China &amp; N BSP; / Picture ) &lt;/Span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Recently, more and more young people have begun to drink tea. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; It is worth noting that the tea here does not refer to milk tea or tea, but to make tea by yourself. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In social media, young people began to show their tea or kung fu tea with cups, a cup of black tea or green tea, and became the standard of the case. Whether it is a postgraduate or a worker, or an overtime, drinking tea is gradually becoming a fashion. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>; &lt;strong>; &lt;span>; Sugar -free tea is once again favored &lt;/span>; &lt;/strong>; &lt;/h4>; &lt;pan>; In fact, before cup of tea, Sanchali, oriental leaves, etc. Sugar -free tea has begun to be favored by young people. This kind of tea drink soaked in the original tea as the raw material is different from all kinds of milk tea. It focuses on sugar -free and tea flavor. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;span>; Whether it is the old -fashioned Sanchali or the Oriental leaves under the Nongfu Spring, when recommending its own products, they emphasize that they are based on natural tea as the raw material, fermentation technology used, and no added added Any sweetener and additives, etc., strive to become its characteristic with the purest original tea. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;span>; For young people under the environment of work and family, paying attention Take intake, and the lifestyle of reducing sugar and abstaining sugar. The change of such a consumer mentality is the main mechanism to bring huge growth space for sugar -free tea. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Related data shows that from 2017 to 2022, the average annual compound growth rate of the market size of sugar -free tea reached 28%. It is expected to maintain a growth of about 10.9%from 2022 to 2027. ——Bing obviously, this wave of &lt;Span>; young people are thinking of being difficult to drink, to starting to adapt to its taste, and start to buy repeatedly. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;span>; However, for this kind of tea encapsulated by plastic bottle, of course, there are still not enough freshness, and the main drinking methods are cold drinks and other shortcomings. Especially cold drinks, for some girls who don&#39;t like frozen, are actually not friendly. Even if it is heated in a convenience store, it feels average when it is drinking, it will even affect the taste. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;img src = &quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/21/F64539bdceb90d4EC2B592DC48CDD6B.jpeg&quot; Border = &quot;0&quot; style = &quot; opacity: 1; &quot;width =&quot; 1080 &quot;height =&quot; 764 &quot;data-src =&quot; // Images.infzm.com/cms/medias/Image/23/11/21/f64539bbd4EC2B592DC48CDD6B. jpeg &quot;data-key =&quot; 259009 &quot;>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style =&quot; color: #999999; text-align: center; &quot;>; &lt;span>; (visual China &amp; nbsp;/picture) &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;strong>; SPAN>; Cup brewing tea fire &lt;/span>; &lt;/strong>; &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; &lt;span>; Today, young people are with sugar tea and frozen sugar -free tea. In contact, more and more young people have begun to give birth to &quot;new demand&quot;. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;span>; Tea Research of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences &lt;/span>; The &quot;2022 New Tea High -quality Development Report&quot; released by institutions and other institutions shows that 46.90%of the &quot;post -90s&quot; Said that I met more traditional tea in the process of new tea consumption. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; According to Douyin data, in 2023, the proportion of interested users from 18 to 30 years old in the tea industry increased to 38.4 %. This shows that the age of tea is moving downward, young people have continued to improve tea awareness, and tea audiences are constantly showing a trend of younger. The latest report of CCTV Finance&#39;s &quot;Zhengxian Finance&quot; section has the latest market observation of &quot;young people love drinking tea and become a new driving force for tea consumption&quot;, which has also attracted attention and hot discussion. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Compared to non -sugar tea, it is actually a lot of benefits. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; First of all, you can choose the fresh &lt;span>; tea. Regardless of whether it is bean -flavored Ming Longjing, a mellow and fragrant Wuyi rock tea, or the oily oolong or Pu&#39;er, different tea brings different taste. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;span>; Fresh tea can immediately force the fresh taste, which is actually more refreshing in taste. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;span>; And, making tea is very friendly for the young ladies and sisters who like hot drinks. You don&#39;t have to be afraid that cold drinking tea will hurt your stomach. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;span>; And buy several different tea leaves, change to drink according to the season or mood, and can also adapt to your taste needs at any time. In the production of tea, it takes a little time to cook water, throw tea, and wait for juice, etc., which can make people feel quiet and comfortable in simple hand work. It is also a buffer of learning or work pressure. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;span>; In the choice of tea, compared with sugar -free tea, the choice of fresh raw materials tea is rich and colorful. Those who like black tea, there are Yunnan red in Yunnan, Jinjunmei, Yinjunmei in Fujian, Qimen black tea in Anhui. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;span>; Like green tea, West Lake Longjing, Dongting Biluochun, Huangshan Maofeng, Xinyang Maojian, and Liu&#39;an Melon in Anhui. Some fragrances are tangy, and some are mellow and moist, which can be described as their own characteristics. Others, there are all kinds of tea such as Shengpu, Mature Pu, Jasmine Tea, Oolong Tea, etc. to choose from. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;span>; Tea can be selected according to the region, production area, year &lt;/span>;, and the production area or craftsman. For young people who have just started, the basic knowledge of some tea is still very interesting. Make some choices in categories and regions, find a few of their favorite tea, and learn simple tea skills. It is actually very fun. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Of course, there are some things to pay attention to when making tea, water quality, water temperature, what utensils are used for soaking, etc. Tea people still need to know. Such as purple sand pots are suitable for brewing black tea, Pu&#39;er tea, oolong tea, Wuyi rock tea, etc., which are not suitable for making green tea. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;span>; Green tea such as Longjing, which is more delicate, cannot be rushed immediately with too hot boiling water. It will destroy the chlorophyll in the tea, make it yellow, and lose the flavor and taste. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>; &lt;strong>; &lt;span>; Tea is a forever track &lt;/span>; &lt;/strong>; &lt;/h4>; &lt;sp>; &lt;span>; At the beginning of drinking, the cooking method of tea has not stopped updating. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;span>; From cooking tea from the Tang Dynasty, to tea from the Song Dynasty, and then the tea made of tea in the Ming and Qing Dynasties, and the spread of matcha overseas such as overseas in Japan. In the age, the tea drinking method has undergone changes. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In modern times, with the changes in technology and technology, there are new Chinese tea drinks represented by various milk tea today. Various sugar -free tea, composite tea drinks containing tea ingredients, and all kinds of bags for making tea. Various tea varieties and tea drinking methods are still changing and iterative, and young people also repeatedly explore and try to consume. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; For young people who like to be popular and follow the trend, the traditional way of &quot;making tea&quot;, because of the driving between social platforms and video platforms and friends, it is very Easy to become a social symbol and communication method, making tea quickly become a lifestyle of young people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The preferences and tastes of young people will also be projected into tea -related &lt;span>; products, such as tea sets, etc., may become younger, simple, and fashionable. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;span>; In the future, I believe that there will still be various ways to drink tea for young people. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;span>; Whether it is the Renaissance of Tea, or the new tea drinking new taste, more and more young people fall in love with tea -related products and consume it. It will further increase the overall market of the tea industry to make the tea ecosystem richer. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 22 Nov 2023 11:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[为保住工作买公司产品？企业与员工间应建立合理边界丨快评]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261008]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-22 10:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Nio’s layoffs have been a hot topic recently. First, there were rumors in the industry that on November 3, 2023, Li Bin, the founder, chairman and CEO of NIO, stated in an internal letter &quot;Organization Optimization and Two-Year Priorities&quot; that in order to further improve execution efficiency and ensure sufficient resources for key businesses To invest, the company will reduce its positions by about 10%, and specific adjustments will be completed in November. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to NIO’s 2022 ESG report released on September 25, it has a total of 26,763 employees. According to this estimate, more than 2,600 people or more will be laid off this time. Regarding NIO’s layoffs, the mainstream narrative on the market revolves around the situation of the electric vehicle industry or the company itself. This is of course a meaningful perspective. Here we can also get into the perspective of employees. According to China Business News, we learned from NIO’s internal employees that the compensation plan is N+3, which should be good. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Currently, a user with the online name &quot;Tangbao&quot; posted on Xiaohongshu, saying that he had worked at NIO for 5.5 years (also known as &quot;became a full-time employee more than a year ago&quot;), which seemed to imply that it was not official before. Worker), nearly 40 years old, with seniors and juniors. He cherishes this job very much. &quot;I often work overtime and stay up all night, all on my own volition. There is no overtime pay and I never complain.&quot; Suddenly, he was told that he was on the layoff list. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;TA alleged that &quot;almost 80%&quot; of Weilai employees have been explicitly or implicitly told that they must buy a Weilai car if they want to keep their jobs. In order to avoid unemployment in middle age, I replaced my Mercedes-Benz CLA, which I bought only two years ago, with a Weilai ET5 before the end of last year. At the end of last year, this person wrote a post titled &quot;One Month of Picking Up the ET5 Car&quot; and said, &quot;In terms of putting users first (the car owner&#39;s father), Weilai is second and no one dares to say that it is first.&quot; This seems to confirm the authenticity of TA purchasing an ET5. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Then he wrote: &quot;My boss talked to me and said that if he wants to be promoted, he must mobilize his friends and relatives to buy a car together.&quot; Then he recommended his cousin and cousin to buy them separately. I bought Weilai ES7 and ES6; at the beginning of this year, in order to get a promotion, I took out a loan to buy an ET5. Attached is a certificate of successful purchase and loan, which shows that the total price of the ET5 purchased is 345,200 yuan, of which the loan is nearly 300,000 yuan and the monthly payment is 8,150.56 yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He claimed that the monthly payment for his first car, an ET5, was 3,000 yuan, so the monthly car loan was more than 10,000 yuan. This person spent more than 600,000 yuan to buy two ET5s, just to keep it. Job and promotion? Does a family need to buy two ET5s? And the time between two purchases is very short. Therefore, some netizens expressed doubts, and some netizens found it credible and believed that &quot;Nio has a hidden culture of mobilizing employees to buy cars (even linked to performance).&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this regard, NIO should clarify: Is this a laid-off employee of NIO? Have you bought two ET5s? This person claimed that &quot;in order to support the company and to stabilize his position, he sold dozens of cars to his relatives and friends, and almost became part-time salesmen.&quot; Is this true or false? Does the company have explicit or implicit rules that require employees to link the purchase of NIO cars to performance, retention and promotion? The media can also investigate these issues to set the record straight. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If the products produced by the company are good and employees need them and buy them voluntarily, there is no problem. However, if employees are required to purchase a certain number or amount of the company&#39;s products in order to stay and be promoted and receive salary increases, that would be a big problem: to put it mildly, it would be ugly and violate the public-private boundary between the company and its employees, because the company It has no right to interfere with employees&#39; private consumption choices; to put it more seriously, this is a &quot;pyramid sales&quot; of the business-profit model. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The real money-making routine of MLM organizations is to drain each participant&#39;s personal money, and through brainwashing, let the participants cash in the trust and love of their relatives and friends, that is, to drain the participants of their important interpersonal relationships. monetary value and then throw it away. A large number of systems destroy the social capital of individual participants, and this is the greatest social harm of MLM. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In view of the fact that most people will work in a company or organization after leaving school, there is a question worth discussing: above employees, we are human beings first, how can we keep our job? Basic human principles? Is it because it is difficult to find a job, or you are worried about losing your job, or you want to be promoted, so you can take the initiative to do anything under the explicit or implicit instructions of the company or your superiors? &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As an employee, especially if you are engaged in a free competition industry, the best strategy to keep your job is always to improve your own strength. I have something that others don’t have, and I have advantages that others have, so that I have some indispensable qualities. Substitutability creates irreplaceable value for the enterprise or makes the substitution cost of the enterprise very high. This strength may be your technical ability, your ability to analyze and judge, or your ability to explore and expand customers. In short, it is best to have the ability to stand alone and give up on others, and to cultivate and maintain your ability to choose.

Use the money to buy the company&#39;s products, allowing you to borrow money or lend to the company. If you go all out and do it, will you definitely get what you want? First, the company or your boss may break the contract, uninstall, or burn bridges; second, you may not be able to win over your colleagues in such a competition to please the company or boss; third, companies that do this often have operational problems, and you are You were using your own salary to save the company, but in the end you were still laid off. Wouldn&#39;t it be a loss of both human and financial resources? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He who knows others is wise, and he who knows himself is wise. The beginning of a person&#39;s wisdom and courage is the courage to face one&#39;s own weakness. Facing a problem head-on is always the first step to solving a problem; a person without courage cannot have a strong core of values ​​and will often be at a loss when encountering difficulties.就算为了生存，你也不需要在心灵上依附于任何人或任何外物，这是软弱与无能的体现；你需要激发出内在的勇气，培植基于实力的勇气，然后去开拓，去工作，去fighting. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 22 Nov 2023 10:25:05 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[以色列内阁投票同意与哈马斯达成临时停火协议]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261041]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;i>; 2023-11-22 09:23:28 &lt;/i>; &lt;/div>; &lt;pan>; According to the Israeli &quot;Land News&quot;, the Israeli cabinet vote in the early morning of the 22nd local time with Palestine Islamic Islamic Resistance movement (Hamas) reaches temporary ceasefire agreement. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 22 Nov 2023 09:55:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[三季度罚没金额145亿，近七成罚金来自第三方支付丨金融合规榜]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261039]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-22 09:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;In the third quarter of 2023, the third-party payment industry became the field with the highest amount of administrative fines and confiscations in the financial industry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Researchers from the Southern Weekend New Financial Research Center found that in the third quarter of 2023, 1,105 institutions and 2,881 individuals were fined a total of 14.531 billion yuan, of which the third-party payment industry accounted for about 70% of the financial penalties.

Photo provided by the interviewee&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In mid-November 2023, when the chrysanthemums were in full bloom, Zhang Liang, a chrysanthemum farm in Nanyang City, Henan Province, released a video saying that the chrysanthemums grown at home Four to five hundred acres of chrysanthemums are picked and stolen by many people every day. In the video he posted, three people were picking chrysanthemums on the ground. Zhang Liang pretended to be a passerby to the person who picked the semi -plastic bag chrysanthemum and asked: &quot;This pick is also a lot of miles. ?” The other party replied: “Pick less and pick as you go.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On November 19, 26-year-old Zhang Liang told Southern Weekend reporters that he was Villagers in Zhangxiu Yuzhuang, Kuofeng Village, Qinghe Town, Fangcheng County, Nanyang City, began contracting land near their homes to grow chrysanthemums in 2017 to process them into chrysanthemum tea. It is now the time when chrysanthemums are blooming and being harvested. Zhang Liang said that there are dozens of cases of stealing every day, and &quot;hundreds of kilograms are lost every day. Like last year, the drones shouted and cursed, and people couldn&#39;t drive them away, which has caused a lot of losses.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;After the video shot by Zhang Liang was posted online, it quickly aroused controversy. Two days later, Zhang Liang deleted the video. He explained: &quot;Some netizens felt that I had discredited Henan people, so I deleted the video. It had nothing to do with anyone.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;Lose the face of Henan people&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style =&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Zhang Liang introduced that the main crops in Fangcheng County are wheat and corn. In 2017, &quot;I saw others planting chrysanthemums, and the profit point was relatively high at the time, so I followed suit.&quot; In July 2021, Zhang Liang established Yicheng Family Farm in Fangcheng County, which mainly grows chrysanthemums. The annual income of chrysanthemums such as Golden Thread Emperor Chrysanthemum, Wuyuan Emperor Chrysanthemum, and Little Emperor Chrysanthemum depends on the market. If the market is good, you can sell more. &quot;But the market has not been good in the past two years.&quot; Zhang Liang&#39;s parents have always taken care of the chrysanthemum field. Zhang Liang, who works outside during the busy farming season, will also come home to help. &lt;p>; At that time, because there were not many chrysanthemums planted in large areas in the local area, many people wanted to do something new. Zhang Liang said that most of the people who came to see the chrysanthemums were people from the surrounding area, and almost all of them were strangers. There were more people on weekends, but he couldn’t estimate how many people there were. “Anyway, they sell noodles, steamed buns and cabbage. , sugar cane juice and other snacks are all set up stalls around here.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;There are more people looking at flowers, so people are climbing and picking chrysanthemums at will. In a previous video, Zhang Liang said that dozens of incidents of stealing chrysanthemums occurred every day. In the past, fences were built at major intersections, but &quot;gentlemen are blocked, not villains.&quot; He told Southern Weekend reporters that he reported to the police for stealing chrysanthemums in 2022. &quot;The police also came, educated him, and fined him 200 yuan.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Zhang Liang believes that the reason why so many people come to his chrysanthemum patch is inseparable from the &quot;propaganda&quot; of some local self-media bloggers. Those who make short videos, they spread the word to ten, and then spread the word to hundreds.” In the online world, Zhang Liang&#39;s chrysanthemum field has a name. It is called &quot;Fangcheng Qinghe Chrysanthemum Garden&quot;, and the hundred-acre chrysanthemum garden is also exaggerated into &quot;thousand acres&quot; and &quot;ten thousand acres&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;A blogger with the online name &quot;Xie Laoer&quot; once recommended Zhang Liang&#39;s chrysanthemum field on November 12, &quot;Why go to Kaifeng to appreciate chrysanthemums? There are acres of chrysanthemums at your doorstep, and you don’t have to pay for it.” An employee of the “Xie Laoer” account told Southern Weekend reporters that “Xie Laoer”’s job is a tour guide, and he usually posts beautiful views of various places in his account. &quot;Let others know where to hang out.&quot; After the video of picking chrysanthemums caused controversy, the comment section of &quot;Xie Laoer&quot; was not peaceful. Some netizens accused him of &quot;bringing misery to other people who grow flowers.&quot; &quot;Xie Laoer&quot; declined the interview from the Southern Weekend reporter, &quot;I don&#39;t want to explain too much. The more trouble there is, the more trouble there is and it won&#39;t be interesting.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The above-mentioned employee told the Southern Weekend reporter that she felt that &quot;Xie Laoer&quot; did not guide everyone to pick flowers. &quot;He just thought that the flowers were strange and the scenery was beautiful. Ask others to see it. There are only a few people picking flowers, but there are still many qualified people.&quot;&lt;span>; &lt;/span>;At the end of &quot;Xie Laoer&quot;&#39;s recommendation video, he emphasized to tourists that &quot;you must not pick other people&#39;s chrysanthemums indiscriminately, cherish the fruits of other people&#39;s labor, and don&#39;t step on them in the fields.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;As a native of Nanyang, the above-mentioned employee believes that people who randomly pick other people&#39;s flowers can be found everywhere. &quot;It&#39;s not that only Henan has such people.&quot; After learning that the incident was on the news, she became even more angry, angry that those who did not realize it had &quot;lost the face of Henan people.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;A tourist squatting in the field to pick chrysanthemums.

Photo provided by the interviewee&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“Defloration exists, but it is very rare”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Zhang Liang felt that he had embarrassed the people of Henan and brought shame to the people of Henan. Henan people smeared it. &quot;As a Henanese, I should add glory to Henanese, but I didn&#39;t expect that (posting the video online) would cause so many negative effects.&quot; Zhang Liang explained that only a few people who came to see the flowers picked the flowers. It did not cause serious economic losses. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On November 18, Zhang Liang released a clarifying video, &quot;My purpose in shooting the video was to persuade everyone to enjoy the flowers in a civilized manner when they come here to check in and take photos. Unexpectedly, It will cause such a big misunderstanding.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In interviews with Southern Weekend reporters, Zhang Liang had a back-and-forth attitude. He sometimes admitted that all this was his personal fault and he would bear the consequences&lt;span>;,&lt; /span>;Sometimes he is full of anger: &quot;To be honest, sometimes I really don&#39;t want to speak out of conscience, and I&#39;m right.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;For my own chrysanthemums to be picked , Zhang Liang’s attitude was equally vague. Sometimes he feels that &quot;people come all the way here, just for fun, picking some is nothing.&quot; &lt;span>;&lt;/span>; Sometimes he feels that &quot;someone really shouldn&#39;t pick it, this is my private property.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; On the evening of November 19th, a staff member of the Propaganda Department of the County Party Committee told the reporter of the Southern Weekend, &quot;Either the local government, It is impossible for our propaganda department to put pressure on people. But the local government immediately went to understand the situation after seeing the video.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;This The staff said: &quot;Their land is a base integrating sightseeing, picking, processing and sales. On weekends or when the weather is good, tourists will come there to check in, but some citizens have some uncivilized behaviors, such as If you want your children to smell the fragrance of flowers, or out of curiosity or as a thought, there are a few people who pick other people&#39;s chrysanthemums. This does exist, but it is definitely a very small minority. It is impossible to say that we &lt;span >;One million people in the city&lt;/span>; county are so unqualified, it’s impossible, robbery or theft simply doesn’t exist.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;It is said , after the incident, the local police intervened and dispatched police officers to the chrysanthemum field to maintain order. &quot;The local government has asked village cadres and party members to go into the fields and inform citizens who go sightseeing to check in that they can check in here, but they cannot go into other people&#39;s fields to pick or trample on them. It is necessary to ensure that the chrysanthemums contracted by farmers are not damaged. This is the most important.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Zhang Liang denied that his chrysanthemum field can be used for tourism, &quot;We just farm our own land and don&#39;t need anyone to promote it.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>; &quot;Looting&quot; or &quot;picking up&quot;? &lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The incident of stealing chrysanthemums is not an isolated incident. Southern Weekend reporters found out that during the autumn harvest period in 2023, looting incidents occurred in many places. On October 3, the property of many music fans at the Nanyang Music Festival was stolen; on October 14, a &quot;hundred acres of corn field was robbed by more than a hundred people&quot; in Dancheng County, Zhoukou City; on October 31, an incident occurred in Huaiyang District, Zhoukou City &quot;Hundreds of people looting medicinal materials&quot; incident. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On November 19, Qiu Jun, the person involved in the &quot;hundreds of people looting medicinal materials&quot; recalled in an interview with a reporter from Southern Weekend that on the afternoon of October 31, the machine was in progress The second time the medicinal materials were harvested, when two-thirds of the harvest was received, the machine broke down and could not work. At that time, one or two hundred people had gathered around the field, mostly elderly people. After the machine failed to harvest, some villagers went into the fields to pick. Later, more and more people came to collect. Qiu Jun and the more than 20 people he hired &lt;span>;&lt;span>;&lt;/span>; gave up after trying to dissuade them to no avail. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Qiu Jun is a major grower of the traditional Chinese medicinal material Atractylodes in Dailou Village, Fengtang Township, Huaiyang District, Zhoukou City. This year is his sixth year of growing Atractylodes. According to previous It is customary for villagers to pick up one or two thousand kilograms of Atractylodes that cannot be harvested by machines in hundreds of acres of land. After the incident, Qiu Jun felt uncomfortable but was powerless to dissuade him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Qiu Jun told Southern Weekend reporters that after the incident was reported by the media, the local police recovered about 800 kilograms of Atractylodes macrocephala, and village cadres also went door-to-door to educate villagers. &quot;They won&#39;t let you enter the land, but you go in. If it sounds good to you, you go pick it up. If it doesn&#39;t sound good to you, you are robbing.&quot; The loudspeaker in the village also broadcasts to educate everyone that &quot;this kind of picking up behavior is bad behavior and violates the law.&quot; . &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Looking back at this incident, Qiu Jun believes that &quot;the common people cannot be blamed.&quot; The villagers who picked up were all elderly people, many of whom were illiterate. They don’t understand the law, so they think they can just pick it up if it falls on the ground. Regarding the public opinion caused by the incident on the Internet, Qiu Jun believed that it had a bad impact on the local reputation. During the interview, he constantly corrected the reporter&#39;s wording, changing &quot;looting&quot; to &quot;picking up.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Zhao Shaohua, senior partner of Beijing Deheheng (Guangzhou) Law Firm, is worried that this approach may make most offenders think that their actions will not be punished. Penalties encourage illegal activities and cause more growers to suffer losses. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Zhao Shaohua said frankly that it is still difficult to classify this type of behavior as climbing, breaking, and picking other people&#39;s crops without the consent of the farmer as an illegal act. First of all, it is difficult to fix and collect evidence. Because large-area crop planting fields are generally in the suburbs and the site area is large, it is difficult to directly fix and collect the direct behavior of the perpetrators of climbing, breaking, and picking. It is often found that the crops were damaged afterwards; subjective identification is also difficult. Difficult, because some rural areas do have the habit of allowing local villagers to pick up small amounts or defective crops left after harvesting in planting fields. In terms of legal evaluation, it is &lt;span>;judge&lt;/span>; whether the perpetrator has illegal possession There are difficulties with subjective purposes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Zhao Shaohua suggested that law enforcement in rural areas should break through the misconception that &quot;the law does not punish the public&quot;. &quot;If some thefts and plundering of crops reach legal levels, law enforcement actions should be taken strictly in accordance with the law, rather than continuing to deal with it vaguely based on &#39;custom&#39;. We should let local villagers know that those who steal, rob or destroy other people&#39;s property will be held accountable in accordance with the law. Legal responsibility, the law does not hold the public accountable and will not be a protective umbrella for anyone.” The Property Rights Section of the Civil Code of the Republic contains special provisions on land contract management rights. The relevant provisions of the Criminal Law and the Public Security Administration Punishment Law are explained to the villagers, and the villagers are informed that their actions are illegal and they will be punished. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>; (At the request of the interviewee, Zhang Liang and Qiu Jun are pseudonyms )&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 22 Nov 2023 08:25:05 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[为什么晚清的改良派、维新派、革命派都推崇黄宗羲？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260980]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-21 23:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 11/20/5pv15xwhbkkf38072k6eaaaw9rxrmek3qiaac6lhq.jpg &quot;border =&quot; 0 &quot;width =&quot; 960 &quot;height =&quot; 680 &quot;data-src =&quot; // Images.infzm.CMS/medias/im/im/im Age/23/11/20/5pv15XWHBKKF38072K6EAAW9RMEK3QIAC6LHQ. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;258890&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Zheng Guanying (center, front row) wrote for the booklet &quot;Yuan Jun·Yuan Chen&quot; introduction. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(data map/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The first Guangzhou Uprising failed in the autumn of 1895. Sun Yat-sen went into exile in Japan and developed the Xingzhonghui organization in Yokohama. Feng Jingru, the proprietor of the literary shop, became the first president of the Yokohama Xingzhong Association. His son Feng Ziyi, who was only 14 years old, also joined as a member. The booklet &quot;Original Lord·Original Minister&quot; copied and prefaced by Zheng Guanying was printed by Yokohama Bunkyo Store. The preface of Feng Ziyi&#39;s &quot;Revolutionary History&quot; states: &quot;There are only two types of propaganda materials for the current Zhonghui: one is &quot;Ten Diaries of Yangzhou&quot;, at the end of which are attached the two books of Dorgon, the regent of the Qing Dynasty, and Kefa, the history of the Mingge Ministry; It is the chapter &quot;Yuanjun·Yuanchen&quot; from the selected edition of Huanglizhou&#39;s &quot;Mingyi Waiting Records&quot;. They were all printed by Yudian.&quot; Feng Ziyi also said: &quot;In the early days of the Xingzhonghui, the literati felt extremely lacking in the propaganda tools they used. , there are only &quot;Ten Diaries of Yangzhou&quot;, &quot;The Jiading Massacre&quot;, and several &quot;Yuanjun&quot; and &quot;Yuanchen&quot; selected from &quot;Mingyi Waiting Records&quot;.&quot; In 1896, the Qing Consul General in San Francisco sent someone to sneak into Sun Yat-sen&#39;s residence to peek , and then reported that &quot;after consulting two books of the prisoner, one series excerpted two chapters of &quot;Yuanjun&quot; and &quot;Yuanchen&quot; from Huanglizhou&#39;s &quot;Mingyi Waiting for Interviews&quot; in Ming Dynasty. A small quotation was added to the end of the volume and he called himself Mr. Qiyou. In June 1897, when Sun Yat-sen was in England, he presented the pamphlet &quot;Yuanjun·Yuanchen&quot; to his Japanese friend Nan Xiongnan. &quot;Yuanjun·Yuanchen&quot; is an abbreviated version of the two chapters &quot;Yuanjun&quot; and &quot;Yuanchen&quot; in Huang Zongxi&#39;s &quot;Records of Visits to the Ming Yi&quot;. It was printed in Japan in the winter of 1895. There is a short note written by &quot;Young Master Qiyou&quot; on the front of the volume. Quote: &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;The ruler has always been born to serve the people, so he is a civilian servant. A ruler cannot rule thousands of people by himself. Therefore, the ministers and workers were built to divide and rule the country, and all those who assisted the emperor were civilian servants. Mencius said: &quot;The people are the most valuable, the country is the second most important, and the king is the least important.&quot; This universal meaning through the ages was spoken by the early generations and tabooed by later generations. They all do not know the meaning of the king and his ministers, who are all born to govern the people. If the earth is deserted and has no living people, how can there be a king? How come there are ministers and workers? However, if you don’t know that you are setting up a king for the people, so if one person is in peace, the people will lose their place; but if you don’t know that you are setting up ministers for the people, then all the officials will be obedient, which will harm the people below and benefit the people above. Wow! The disadvantages of this are that everyone&#39;s heart is wrong but no one can fully understand it or express it clearly. It has been deeply feared by Lingyi to this day. Only Mr. Huang Lizhou of the Ming Dynasty had a family tradition of loyalty and filial piety, excellent writing ability, and far-sightedness that transcended the ages. I tasted a compilation of &quot;Records of Visits to the Ming Yi&quot;, which was entrusted to Jizi&#39;s hardships and hardships. There are the two theories of &quot;Yuan Jun&quot; and &quot;Yuanchen&quot;. The excerpts of this book are published in the hope of enlightening the younger generations and revealing the foundation of China&#39;s self-improvement. Confucius said: &quot;Whoever knows me is from the Spring and Autumn Annals, and whoever offends me is from the Spring and Autumn Annals?&quot; I follow this order to inform those who want to be rich and powerful in this world. At the beginning of summer in Yiwei, Qi worried about Young Master Xiaoyin. &lt;/span>; (Quoted from Sun Weihua&#39;s &quot;An Examination of the Authors of &quot;Short Quotes of &quot;Yuan Jun Yuan Chen&quot;&quot;&quot;)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Who is &quot;Mr. Qiyou&quot;? There are different opinions in the academic circles such as Wang Tao and Sun Yat-sen, Ono Kazuko, Li Ao Think it is Zheng Guanying. Sun Weihua of South Central University for Nationalities conducted in-depth research and determined that the author was Zheng Guanying based on the content of &quot;Wei Yan in the Prosperity&quot; and the use of the pseudonym &quot;Qi Yousheng&quot; in his early work &quot;Yi Yan&quot;. The argument was strong. The author searched &quot;Shenbao&quot; and found that Zheng Guanying also published poems under the pseudonym &quot;Tiecheng Qiyousheng&quot;, and &quot;Tiecheng&quot; is the nickname of Shiqi, the seat of Xiangshan County. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Tao once wrote a postscript for Zheng Guanying&#39;s &quot;Yi Yan&quot;: &quot;Qi Yousheng didn&#39;t know who he was, but he later learned that he lived in Tiecheng, his surname was Xingyang, he traveled all over the north and south, and he stayed in Shanghai for the longest time. . The place is visited by crowns and merchants, and Qi Wensheng lives there. He is neither an official nor a secluded person, and he is also an official and a scholar. Every day, he makes friends with the virtuous and powerful elders, and chats with them about world affairs. Sometimes he bursts into tears and strikes. Broken saliva pot. Today, Guo Yunxian, the minister of Xiangxiang, and Chen Liqiu, Secretary Xian of Wuchuan, all appreciate it. They often want to wipe it away and plan to recruit Xingjin to prepare for a visit. However, Qi Wensheng insists on saying goodbye, and only sends his love to Xiangsu every day. , Si Zhi Lin Quan, Mo Huang and Yu, just reading for self-entertainment.&quot; Scholars who are familiar with Wang Tao and Zheng Guanying can easily find that the writing style of Xiaoyin is very similar to &quot;Warning Statements in the Prosperity&quot;, heavy and slightly clumsy, and rhythmic with Wang Tao&#39;s ups and downs The sophisticated writing style is completely different. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1894, Zheng Guanying worked hard for Sun Yat-sen to write a letter to Li Hongzhang. After Sun Yat-sen&#39;s &quot;rebellion&quot;, Zheng Guanying destroyed the materials on the close contact between the two. According to Yi Huili&#39;s research, before Sun Yat-sen launched the Guangzhou Uprising in the autumn of 1895, &quot;Zheng Guanying was in Guangdong in May and June.&quot; The news that Emperor Guangxu requested the printing of 2,000 volumes of &quot;Warnings in the Prosperous Age&quot; &quot;prompted Zheng Guanying to interrupt his activities in Guangdong and return to Shanghai. &quot;. This time coincides with the date when Xiaoyin was signed, &quot;Yiwei Lixia&quot; (May 6, 1895). A bold guess is that Zheng Guanying gave the abbreviated copy of &quot;Yuanjun·Yuanchen&quot; to Sun Yat-sen together with the small quotation. After Sun Yat-sen went into exile in Japan, he handed the manuscript to Feng Jingru for publication. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The two chapters &quot;Yuanjun&quot; and &quot;Yuanchen&quot; are from Huang Zongxi&#39;s &quot;Mingyi Waiting for Visits&quot;. &quot;Yuan Jun&quot; criticizes the monarch for &quot;taking my selfishness as the great prince of the world&quot; and &quot;bringing great harm to the world&quot;. &quot;Yuan Chen&quot; points out that the responsibility of ministers is &quot;for the world, not for the king; for all the people, not for one surname.&quot; also&quot;. The democratic ideas expounded in the two chapters were very suitable for Sun Yat-sen to use to criticize the Qing court, and also met the needs of radical reformists and reformers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Between 1895 and 1898, Kang Youwei and Zheng Guanying had in-depth cooperation. On December 1, 1895, Zheng Guanying wrote to Wang Tao: &quot;Kang Changsu, the governor, was ordered by Nanpi to go to Shanghai to set up Qiangxue Bookstore. I asked my brother to visit Mr. Wang at two o&#39;clock in the afternoon...&quot; Zheng Guanying once accompanied Kang Youwei to visit Wang Tao. Zheng Guanying was also one of the main persons in charge of Qiangxue Bookstore, and his role was deliberately downplayed by Kang Liang. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liang Qichao later commented on &quot;Records of Visits to the Ming Yi&quot; in &quot;The Academic History of China in the Past Three Hundred Years&quot; and said: &quot;During the reign of Emperor Guangxu, a group of our friends privately printed many copies and gave them away as a way to promote democracy. Tools.&quot; In the book &quot;Introduction to Qing Dynasty Academics&quot;, Liang Qichao also said: &quot;Liang Qichao and Tan Si, their contemporaries, advocated the theory of civil rights and republic, so they copied it, printed tens of thousands of copies, and spread it secretly. Change is extremely powerful.&quot; Yu Guolin wrote a long &quot;Revision Note&quot; for the new edition of Zhonghua Book Company&#39;s &quot;Introduction to Academics of the Qing Dynasty&quot;, which pointed out that &quot;the excerpts of &quot;Yuanjun&quot; and &quot;Yuanchen&quot; from &quot;The Records of Visits to the Ming Yi&quot; were printed. The pamphleteer is actually Mr. Qiyou&quot; and &quot;this section is actually a propaganda tool for the revolutionaries.&quot; Liang only mentioned &quot;Ming Yi Waiting for Visits&quot; but did not mention &quot;Yuanjun&quot; and &quot;Yuanchen&quot;, perhaps intentionally. Before the 1898 Coup, in a written conversation with Japanese strategist Miyazaki Toten (Miyazaki Toten), Sun Yat-sen said that he and Liang Qichao had a &quot;secret language&quot; and they were not afraid of leaks when communicating with each other: &quot;My brother wants to send a letter to Shanghai, please ask Liang Qichao Or one of his close associates came here for a visit.&quot; This shows that Sun and Liang had been in contact for a long time, and they did not start dating after Liang Qichao went into exile in Japan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liang Qichao and Sun Yat-sen shared the pamphlet &quot;Yuanjun·Yuanchen&quot; compiled by Zheng Guanying as a propaganda tool, revealing that the faction affiliation of some historical figures was not as fixed as imagined. The intellectuals who devoted themselves to the revolution in the late Qing Dynasty have more or less experienced the &quot;reform&quot; stage. Sun Yat-sen&#39;s letter to Li Hongzhang is the best proof; Liang Qichao once tended to be full of revolution; Zheng Guanying may not have had &quot;revolutionary&quot; ideas, but it was not convenient to make them public. Huang Zongxi&#39;s famous articles &quot;Yuan Jun&quot; and &quot;Yuan Chen&quot; can be shared by progressive forces of all factions. It also shows that for a period of time after the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War of 1898-1894, the progressive forces had not yet found a suitable weapon of public opinion. Huang Zongxi&#39;s heroic articles were the most &quot;easy&quot; ones. It is a propaganda tool used by revolutionaries to promote the revolution, and by radical reformists and reformers to promote the urgency of reform. Huang Zongxi&#39;s historical status suddenly increased in the late Qing Dynasty, which was conducive to the promotion of Paiman and the Republic of Xujun. However, it would be too flattering to say that &quot;Records of Visits to the Ming Yi&quot; had an ideological enlightenment effect on Zheng Guanying and Sun Yat-sen. After all, these two people could directly Reading English works, they are exposed to more powerful ideas than Huang Zongxi. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(The original title is &quot;&quot;Yuan Jun·Yuan Chen&quot;: Shared Texts of Zheng Guanying, Liang Qichao, and Sun Yat-sen&quot;, now The title is planned by the editor) &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;/p>; &lt;br>; &lt;hr>; &lt;div>; Get more RSS: &lt;br>; &lt;a href = &quot;https://feedx.nett &quot;STYLE =&quot; COLOR: Orange &quot;target =&quot; _blank &quot;>; https://feedx.net &lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href =&quot; https://feedx.best &quot;style =&quot; Color: Orange &quot;target = &quot;_blank&quot;>; https://feedx.best &lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 21 Nov 2023 23:25:03 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
