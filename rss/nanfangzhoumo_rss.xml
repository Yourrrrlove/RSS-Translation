According to media reports, many Mejim stores in many cities across the country have suddenly closed, making it difficult for parents to refund their fees. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, not only Magim, but also early education institutions such as Nanadazhen and Gymboree have also been in trouble recently. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Once upon a time, the early childhood education industry with a market worth hundreds of billions was very prosperous, and famous early education institutions such as Mejim were developing very rapidly. Why has the situation changed so suddenly now? What is the future of the early childhood education industry? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&lt;span>;The high-profile &quot;100 billion market&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;From the birth of a child to primary school Education in previous stages can be called early education. Based on the physical and mental development characteristics and brain development characteristics of infants and young children, providing them with scientific, rich, and appropriate information stimulation and training can develop children&#39;s physical and mental potential and promote their all-round development. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Early education can be divided into two stages: 0-3 years old, infants and young children do not go to kindergarten, but early education can already be carried out; after 3 years old, children can formally When entering kindergarten, in addition to systematic early education in schools, early education institutions outside schools also play a supplementary role. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;For a long time in the past, the concept of early education in China was not popular, and many parents were not aware of the function of early education. After the 1990s, with the continuous development of China&#39;s economy and the closer economic and ideological exchanges with foreign countries, foreign early childhood education concepts began to influence Chinese parents, and a number of early childhood education institutions came into being. However, the industry is still in its infancy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the second decade of the new century, the early childhood education industry has truly ushered in rapid development. As Chinese people become richer, they pay more attention to their children’s education and are more willing to invest in it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many people born in the 1980s and 1990s have become parents. Young people are more likely to accept some new educational concepts. They pay more attention to their children&#39;s early education than their parents, believing that this is the first and most important thing for children. But it is also the &quot;starting line&quot; that has been ignored in the past. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;At the same time, foreign early childhood education institutions represented by Mejim have entered our country in a large scale. The more mature and systematic operating models they represent have emerged from first- and second-tier cities. It continues to spread to third- and fourth-tier cities. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Data from Zhiyan Consulting shows that since 2014, the number of investment events in the domestic early childhood education service industry has increased, and the amount of investment has increased significantly. The number of investment and financing events in 2014 was nearly 50, and it exceeded 110 in 2015. From 2015 to 2018, there were more than 90 investment and financing events every year. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;From 2012 to 2016, the amount of investment in the early childhood education industry has increased year by year, exceeding 4 billion yuan in 2017. In 2018, the investment amount soared to 9.644 billion Yuan. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;According to &lt;/span>; research reports, the market size of my country’s early childhood education industry has increased year by year from 2016 to 2020, with the market size reaching 327.6 billion yuan and 327.6 billion yuan respectively in 2021 and 2022. 350 billion yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although with the decline in fertility rates, the number of newborns born every year is decreasing. Because of the huge population base, the early childhood education market is still favored by the outside world &lt;span>;. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/10/f504711fea7233163eb90242fcedefc6.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/10/f504711fea7233163eb90242fcedefc6.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;253570 &quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span>;（IC photo&amp;nbsp;/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&lt; span>;From unlimited glory to the edge of thunder&lt;/span>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In the pre-epidemic era, the early childhood education industry has been in a state of expansion: various online and offline institutions have shown their respective Supernatural powers; there are various subdivisions - English, mathematical thinking, Chinese language, children&#39;s songs, picture books, young children&#39;s animation, etc., all of which have formed specialized tracks. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In 2018, Mejim successfully landed on the A-share market and became the “No. 1 early childhood education stock”. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Meijim’s 2018 financial report shows that the company’s total revenue in 2018 was 265 million yuan, and its total profit was 60.49 million yuan; in 2019, the company’s total revenue increased by 137.35% year-on-year. %, to 630 million yuan, and the total profit increased by 302.54% to 243 million yuan; as of Q1 2019, there were 451 US Jim centers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The arrival of the epidemic has had a huge impact on all offline industries, and Mejim is no exception. Mejim&#39;s total revenue in 2020 was 356 million yuan - almost halved compared to 2019. The total revenue in 2021 was 336 million yuan, and the total revenue in 2022 was 154 million yuan - only half of 2021. Revenue in the first quarter of 2023 was only 29.54 million yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The company&#39;s operating profit is even worse. The total profit in 2020 was -531 million yuan, and the total profit in 2021 was -57.4551 million yuan. The total profit was -610 million yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The sluggish early childhood education industry raises the risk of “explosion” because almost all early childhood education institutions are in the form of prepaid consumption, that is, the institutions sell lesson packages to parents, and a lesson package can easily cost It costs tens of thousands of yuan, and the course package covers a period ranging from a few months to a few years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although in August 2018, the General Office of the State Council issued the &quot;Opinions on Regulating the Development of Off-Campus Training Institutions&quot;, it put forward clear requirements for early childhood education and other off-campus training institutions to collect tuition fees from &lt;span>;educated persons: &quot;No A one-time charge for a time span of more than 3 months.&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In fact, it is common for early childhood education institutions to charge a one-time fee for a time span of more than 3 months, and it has even become Industry practice. When the institution is operating normally, the course package format will be more &quot;favorable&quot;; once the institution becomes unsustainable and the offline institution closes, parents will have no place to take the remaining courses they purchased and would like&lt;/span>; a refund. But it is also difficult to get a refund, which is like a &quot;thunder&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is true that the epidemic is an important reason for the difficulties encountered by many early childhood education institutions. In fact, the crisis of many early childhood education institutions has already been laid. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First, blind expansion leads to a sharp increase in costs. Early childhood education institutions are mostly offline education. They are usually rented in bustling shopping malls, with an average area of ​​about 200 square meters. The monthly rent and labor costs are very high, and the monthly operating costs can easily reach tens of thousands of yuan. If customer renewal and new acquisition are not ideal, you will lose money. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In the pre-epidemic era, many early childhood education institutions were eager for quick success and expansion too fast, and had already shown signs of operational difficulties. The impact of the epidemic has completely erupted the crisis. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Secondly, due to the rapid development of the early childhood education industry in the past few years, many people want to get a piece of the pie and have opened early childhood education institutions. Due to the lack of standards and insufficient teachers in the early childhood education industry, many practitioners do not even have kindergarten teacher qualification certificates and can directly take up their posts after simple training. This has also resulted in the overall level of the early childhood education industry being low, and many parents have lost trust in early childhood education institutions. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Under the impact of the epidemic, many parents found that their children actually grew very well without attending early childhood education classes. They couldn’t help but reflect on whether the early childhood education classes they enrolled in before were paying attention.&lt;/span>; IQ tax. Nowadays, many parents will search for relevant information on social media when registering for classes. Once there are more voices of &quot;distrust&quot; of early childhood education institutions, parents&#39; willingness to register for classes will decrease. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So, although the epidemic is over, early childhood education institutions have not &lt;span>; experienced the rapid recovery expected. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&lt;span>;Standardized development will have a future&lt;/span>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Early childhood education is still a market worth hundreds of billions. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Although the fertility rate has declined, Chinese parents currently attach great importance to their children’s education; under the “double reduction” policy, the early childhood education industry has not been greatly affected, but instead the discipline The weakening of training has made many parents more willing to invest in their children in aspects such as painting and physical fitness, and these are areas that early childhood education has always been involved in. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The early childhood education industry is now facing difficulties, which is an opportunity for the industry to take a break. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the one hand, in the pre-epidemic era, although the early childhood education industry developed rapidly, it was generally in a state of barbaric growth: there were no standards and a lack of regulations. &lt;span>;For example, my country&#39;s nurseries and kindergartens adopt a &quot;dual-track system&quot; model. Childcare services for infants aged 0-3 years old are separated from care and education for children aged 3-6 years old. The former is managed by the Health Commission and the latter is managed by the education department. . &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In terms of curriculum connection, our country currently has clearer educational suggestions for the learning and development goals and child care work of children aged 3 to 6 years old. Relatively speaking, children aged 0 to 3 years old There is a lack of educational advice for infants and young children. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;This gives many early childhood education institutions room to fish in troubled waters. Although parents spend a lot of money to send their children to institutions, there is actually no way to judge whether the courses are reasonable and whether the teachers are qualified. I don&#39;t know if it has any effect. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As long as this &quot;fuzzy&quot; space exists and the standards of excellence and inferiority are not clear, it will be difficult to establish the rules of survival of the fittest. To establish industry norms, not only early childhood education institutions need self-discipline, but also relevant departments such as education need to gather industry experts and issue relevant standards so that early childhood education has rules to follow. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the other hand, regarding the current prepaid consumption problem that is common in early childhood education institutions, it is necessary to effectively strengthen the supervision of funds to prevent early childhood education institutions from misappropriating funds, which in turn triggers the risk of thunderstorms. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Early childhood education institutions should be more cautious when expanding and not misappropriate consumers&#39; money to do risky things. Only when funds are safer, the industry is more orderly, and parents&#39; trust is established, can the early childhood education industry truly develop in the long run. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 12 Oct 2023 21:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[《大宅门》导演郭宝昌去世]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258485]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-12 20:30:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;On October 11, 2023, Guo Baochang died in Beijing at the age of 83.

When she was critically ill, she asked to see Xu Zhimo&#39;s ex-wife Zhang Youyi, and the two finally met. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A century ago, an ordinary village in southeast England witnessed an extraordinary event. The village is called Shaxton, and the protagonists of the incident are two young Chinese. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The boys have been studying in the United States and the United Kingdom for more than two years, and the girls just left a conservative small town in China a few weeks ago; the boys are auditors at Cambridge University, and the girls have only learned basic daily English for a few weeks. ; The boy wants to be a pioneer in the new era and become a blockbuster, while the girl just hopes to adapt to life in a foreign country and have the opportunity to learn some new knowledge; the boy falls in love with a girl who comes from a reformist family and is studying in the UK at the time. Not long after the girl arrives in London, she vaguely notices her husband. There is another person that I like, but I still hope that my husband, who has always regarded me as a &quot;country bumpkin&quot;, can communicate more with me. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This couple is Xu Zhimo and Zhang Youyi. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In September 1921, less than nine months after Zhang Youyi was sent to England by her parents-in-law, Xu Zhimo suddenly filed for divorce and left without saying goodbye a week later, leaving her who was more than three months pregnant. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In June 2001, Hong Kong scholar and writer Kong Huiyi passed through Shaxton. The size of the town expanded and the old houses were demolished, but the practical and boring temperament did not change. She thought at the time: The struggle of a young Chinese woman in the early 20th century was buried in this inconspicuous place. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Afterwards, she thought again: How could the story of Chinese women be buried in just one or two places? The idea eventually evolved into a book. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Chinese women&#39;s movement began in the 1880s, with two major slogans: &quot;anti-foot-binding&quot; and &quot;promoting women&#39;s education.&quot; At that time, both the reformers and the revolutionary men believed that self-improvement was the basis for national salvation, so they included women&#39;s issues on the social reform agenda. At this time, the expectations for women were still limited to being good wives and mothers. Although they had greatly developed physically and mentally compared with their predecessors, they still only fulfilled their traditional family roles. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The New Culture Movement broke the traditional family operating model of elders and younger ones, striving for personal and individual liberation. This new trend created another ideal image of free and independent women. To be called a &quot;May Fourth&quot; new woman with an independent personality, she must meet several conditions: receive education in a new-style school; have a career after graduation; be independent in marriage; and participate in public life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among them, education is the foundation. For adult women, they are unable to strive for new educational opportunities, so in the era of drastic changes, they are labeled as backward and feudal. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Kong Huiyi hopes to break this simple label division and &quot;explore whether the women of the May Fourth era can be revalued in a fair manner and whether the world they face can be seen from their perspective.&quot; In &quot;May 4th Marriage&quot;, she went against the tradition of male-centered biographies and turned her pen to seven women: Zhu An, Xu Guangping, Jiang Dongxiu, Cao Peisheng, Zhang Youyi, Lu Xiaoman, and Lin Huiyin, trying to explore through their life circumstances the problems faced by women at that time. practical problems, depicting the various faces of Chinese women in the period of change. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;The trend of &quot;escape from marriage&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Whether it is the new cultural movement or the new concept of women, they all have the same core issues: marital autonomy and divorce. Since most young people had entered into arranged marriages at that time, there was a trend of &quot;escape from marriage&quot; - young men leaving home alone to start a new life in order to get rid of their old wives. According to a 1922 women&#39;s publication, 70% of the old-style wives abandoned by the new youth in Henan Province ended up committing suicide. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The reality of marriage and divorce in the new cultural period is a mirror that reflects how the drastic changes in social norms affect women from different backgrounds, and how they deal with the tide of change. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Kong Huiyi wrote about Zhu An, hoping to &quot;find their voices for a generation of women who have suffered a lot and are speechless.&quot; When Lu Xun started his second marriage, he did not abandon his first wife Zhu An financially and nominally. However, the blow to Zhu An was emotional and spiritual. When she was still alive, Lu Xun and the people around him regarded her as a gift that could not be refused. She might be worthy of pity, but not respect. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In previous biographies surrounding Lu Xun, descriptions of Zhu An often tended to indicate that he was &quot;inadequate&quot;. Kong Huiyi pointed out that this historical perspective of discrimination against old women is based on prejudice and does not really reflect the mentality and personality of the person involved. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhu An was interviewed by reporters in her later years. When talking about her relationship with Lu Xun and Xu Guangping, she once said: &quot;Mr. Zhou was not bad to me. There were no quarrels between us. We each have our own lives. I He should be forgiven... Mr. Xu treats me very well, she understands my thoughts, and she is willing to support me... She is indeed a good person.&quot; It can be seen from her words that she puts Lu Xun and Xu Guangping on an equal footing with herself On the other hand, she had no jealousy towards Xu Guangping, but instead established a mutually respectful relationship with her. This is no easy task, and this shows that her heart and character cannot be summed up simply by the label &quot;old woman&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhu An was sacrificed between the old and the new. In contrast, Xu Guangping had the opportunity to receive modern education and enter the world of new women. However, the marriage relationship established through free love and personal choice caused Xu Guangping to lose his original independent status. She had her own career before she and Lu Xun lived together. After arriving in Shanghai, she actively looked for a job. However, she later became Lu Xun&#39;s secretary and assistant, embarking on a completely different path than she originally expected - becoming a virtuous person in the new cultural norms. A good wife and mother. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xu Guangping has always kept three hundred yuan in savings as &quot;emergency money&quot; and publicly told Lu Xun and his friends that if their relationship breaks down, the money can temporarily maintain her livelihood until she resumes her life. Get a job. A meager three hundred yuan became Xu Guangping&#39;s only way to maintain his independent personality. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The traditional concept of &quot;men taking charge outside and women taking charge inside&quot; has not been diminished by the New Culture Movement. When Lin Huiyin faced Liang Sicheng, who was pragmatic and capable and treated her well, she could not help but complain that she was burdened with housework and was unable to develop her talents. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the 1950s and 1950s, although many women had successful careers, they were unable to get rid of the dilemma of marriage and love throughout their lives. Cao Peisheng is an extreme example. She married the husband arranged by her parents at the age of sixteen. With the support of her brother studying in the United States, she continued to study at the Women&#39;s Normal School when she was eighteen. When her husband&#39;s family decided to have a concubine, Cao Peisheng resolutely left the marriage. Soon after, she fell in love with Hu Shi. At that time, Hu Shi had been married to Jiang Dongxiu for six years and had three children. Hu Shi failed to divorce, and the two fell in love for three years, but the hopeless relationship was finally shelved. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As the first female professor of agriculture in China, Cao Peisheng has made extraordinary achievements in cotton and potato research and genetics. However, her bitter love with Hu Shi lingered throughout her life. She filled in a lot of words, constantly remembering the passionate love that year. After his death, he was buried on the only road from his hometown to Hu Shi&#39;s hometown. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Kong Huiyi believes that Cao Peisheng’s situation reflects the conflict between old and new culture. New women and their love partners often cannot control the compass of life. Although their eyes are on the new world, they are faced with the reality created by the old tradition. Stumble. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/hr2KLTa7VdEADCwhMyt0UrsUlRnkbZScs5KLBFGv.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;671&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/hr2KLTa7VdEADCwhMyt0UrsUlRnkbZScs5KLBFGv.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253794&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In 1930, Xu Guangping took a photo with her husband Lu Xun and son Zhou Haiying. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Between the Old and the New&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Cao Peisheng was born in 1902 In that year, the Qing government issued an edict to &quot;anti-foot-binding&quot; and &quot;promote women&#39;s education.&quot; There is a gulf between what government says is one thing and how society works is another. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The actual effect of the ban was very small. The custom of foot binding continued to flourish until the early years of the Republic of China, and Cao Peisheng was not spared. She left her hometown in 1915 and followed her married brother Cao Chengke&#39;s family to Wuchang. Cao Chengke asked a tutor to teach his sister instead of sending her to a new school. This also shows that although the slogan of &quot;promoting girls&#39; education&quot; has been shouted for more than ten years, the results are still limited. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the new cultural transformation stage, the boundaries between the old and the new are far less clear-cut than imagined. Xu Guangping was born in Guangzhou. His mother is from Macau and his maternal grandfather is an overseas Chinese. However, his mother&#39;s family attaches great importance to the &quot;three-inch golden lotus&quot;, so they forced Xu Guangping to bind his feet. However, his father did not agree. However, the reason was that Xu Guangping had been married since he was a child. , she will marry into a country family in the future, and her small feet will be an obstacle to her married life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The elders on the father&#39;s side did not allow girls in the family to study, thinking that it would dampen the ambition of boys. Xu Guangping&#39;s mother, who had studied with her brothers, raised objections and won the opportunity for her daughter to enter a private school. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xu Guangping’s parents had conflicting views on their daughter’s foot-binding and schooling issues, which reflected the social background at that time: even though they lived in Guangzhou and Macau, which had a lot of contact with the outside world, the people’s understanding of “new” and “old” The measurement is still uneven, there is no fixed standard, and opinions are mostly influenced by personal experience. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this context, the term &quot;new woman&quot; also has multi-layered connotations. Jiang Dongxiu, newly added to the simplified version of &quot;May Fourth Marriage&quot;, has never attended a new school and has no career of her own. However, she learned to write letters in vernacular after marriage and tried to write an autobiography. Twenty years of living in Beijing transformed her. He has his own opinions and social circle, and also fights for the rights of Liang Zongdai&#39;s first wife, appearing in court as a witness in their divorce lawsuit. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;She is not limited to any frame. She is neither a traditional woman who &#39;obeys her husband&#39; or &#39;submit her son&#39;, nor is she a new-style Yun Niang who follows her husband and his wife, nor is she a Western-style lady who likes to dress up fashionably.&quot; In Kong Huiyi&#39;s view, Jiang Dongxiu, who has an independent personality and individuality, is also an atypical &quot;new woman&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Compared to Jiang Dongxiu who &quot;steps out of the box&quot;, Lu Xiaoman, who seems to be trendy, is actually the one who &quot;falls into the cracks&quot;. She reflected another common new image of women in society at that time - leisurely at home, dressed fashionably, and her daily life consisted of shopping, attending theaters, playing cards, and dancing. In her early years, she was in and out of social circles and was the envy of everyone. Xu Zhimo made her leave her original life track. The new social circle forced her to face the scrutiny of another new female standard. In Xu Zhimo&#39;s circle of friends, no one would think that a modern woman who is accustomed to the life of an official wife is the new woman in their eyes. Lu Xiaoman is like a lost person, falling into the cracks of culture. Among them, the influence of family cannot be ignored. The female model she can refer to - the circle in which her mother hangs out, are such upper-class wives. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among the first wives of new culture celebrities, Zhang Youyi has left the farthest. Today, people associate her name with successful career women, but they tend to ignore the various conditions required for old women to grow into new women. Reflection on this point is the book&#39;s deep attention to female identity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Trapped alone in England became a turning point in Zhang Youyi&#39;s fate. After joining her brother in Europe, she regained her ideal of studying at a normal school before marriage and studied in Germany for more than three years, which had a decisive impact on her path after returning to China. Later, it was a story that people talked about: he took charge of the Shanghai Women&#39;s Bank, served as the manager of Yunshang Clothing Company, and became famous in Shanghai. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, after having a successful career, Zhang Youyi still felt inferior and could not let go of the fact that she had received less new education. In her later years, she recounted the past to her grandniece Zhang Bangmei and said: &quot;In China, women are nothing: they obey their father at home, their husbands when they get married, and their sons after their husbands die.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this book, the last person to appear is It was Lin Huiyin, who was also born the latest among the seven women. As the leader of the May Fourth New Women in many people&#39;s minds, Lin Huiyin has achieved a rare balance between career and marriage. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A Douban netizen wrote a comment for &quot;May Fourth Marriage&quot;: &quot;Leaving Lin Huiyin for the last time really has a special meaning. This sense of strength is both the intentional cultivation of the family (father) and personal sensitivity and wisdom. , and cannot be separated from Liang Sicheng&#39;s inner stable &quot;freedom&quot; - which is also the only equality and autonomy in several relationships. Even so, it is difficult to escape the troubles of upbringing and family chores, not to mention the repeated hammering of the great waves of the times. The author has already stated that it is difficult to turn around: one must be young, have a good family background, and have fathers and brothers who are sensible and supportive of women—Zhang Youyi’s luck is a personal achievement and indeed a gift from fate.”&lt;/p>; &lt;h4 >;&lt;strong>;“To this day, women still face a lot of traditional pressure”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: italics, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;The order of the characters in this book seems to have a special meaning. Have you had any special considerations? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Kong Huiyi: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Before I started writing, I felt that the descriptions of the so-called old women and new women failed to show the reality of the period of cultural drastic changes. To change the traditional conclusion about women, in addition to the author&#39;s basic position, we must also have substantial and reliable materials. As far as first-hand information is concerned, I always think it is inherently insufficient. How to remedy it? Choosing characters whose life lines have intersected can provide readers with overlapping visual effects, allowing everyone to better understand that things are not black and white. I feel that this book is a bit like a jigsaw puzzle with some missing pieces, relying only on the integration and comparison of the existing pieces to give readers a rough idea of ​​the overall picture. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Seven women have various contrasts. Among them, Cao Peisheng There seems to be a sharp contrast with Zhang Youyi, one who has a successful career but is trapped in love all his life, and one who donates autumn fans but shines in the workplace. When you first read and sorted out the life experiences of these women, did you intuitively experience a sense of reflection? Or experienced a deepening of cognition? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Kong Huiyi: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Their experiences have some similarities. For example, after their marriages failed, they both received valuable opportunities for further study, and also gained valuable opportunities in their respective lives. The industry writes a new page for women. I think the differences between them in life are mainly due to their personalities. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When collecting materials, I did not deliberately make comparisons, but the process of writing a book is like making friends with the characters in the book. The understanding will deepen, just like making friends in reality, and you will embrace them. Looking at their lives with an understanding attitude, they often have the feeling that &quot;people are different and each has their own face.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You emphasize the merging of boundaries between the new and the old in the new cultural transformation stage It’s not as clear as imagined. Is this one of the important starting points for you in writing this book? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Kong Huiyi: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;This is indeed a very important point. I have always been skeptical of black and white discussions, because our own experiences constantly remind us that life is not black and white. To this day, women still face many traditional pressures. For example, if you study for two more degrees, you will be warned that you will not be able to get married; if you don&#39;t get married, you will become the target of preaching every time relatives get together; if you get married and don&#39;t have children, you will be accused of being &quot;selfish.&quot; All these are just trivial matters, but they are annoying enough. Not to mention being belittled and taken advantage of in the workplace. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;This kind of narrative in the book can also be seen as old and new Ambiguity of concept and identity: Unlike Zhu An and Lu Xiaoman, Jiang Dongxiu has truly gained respect in her husband&#39;s circle of friends. What factors do you think lead to this difference? At that time, were the standards for evaluating women in cultural circles complex and diverse? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Kong Huiyi: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Tang Degang said that Jiang Dongxiu was lucky. I agree very much because her husband has a gentle personality and a Western gentlemanly demeanor towards women, which makes her She can play to her strengths. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, the cultural circle is not single. Each circle has its own internal operating standards. For example, when Zhu An was in the big Xintaimen family of the Zhou family, he would not be considered unqualified; Lu Xiaoman was the envy of everyone when he was in and out of social circles in his early years. It is only after entering a new circle that they are measured by another standard. Even if it is not a period of cultural upheaval, there are examples of such situations. For example, when an ordinary family marries a wealthy family, both parties will face new standards of measurement. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;“When it comes to women’s experience, economic issues always rear their heads”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font- family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;The article mentions that Lin Huiyin is regarded by many as China&#39;s leading new woman in the 20th century, and the same appreciation is revealed between the lines in your words.

As she said herself, she is a person with equally strong reason and emotion, so I believe that her decision is not purely driven by reason, but &quot;love&quot; also plays a large role. Speaking of being calm, I think this may be the reason why she wanted to see Zhang Youyi when she was critically ill - because Zhang Youyi&#39;s abandonment had something to do with her, she couldn&#39;t be calm. It is impossible to know what she wanted to say at that time. If I put on my hat as a novelist and made up a sentence for her, it would be &quot;I admire you.&quot; However, maybe she really doesn&#39;t need to speak: Zhang Youyi is willing to see her, she has the demeanor of a successful lady, and she has children and grandchildren around her, so she can feel at ease. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Why was the character Jiang Dongxiu not included in the first edition? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Kong Huiyi: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;This is a very important question. When I wrote the first version, I felt that Jiang Dongxiu was elusive. Looking back, it was a bit paradoxical, because I later realized that the biggest obstacle might be mahjong. This is related to the situation of big family gatherings when I was a child. During every festive occasion, the elders would always play mahjong when they got together, which we children found very noisy. But it was mahjong that finally broke the psychological barrier for me: One of my great-aunts was critically ill and was hospitalized. When relatives came to visit, she said in confusion, &quot;Ask the servant to open the table for you.&quot; This finally made me understand the role of mahjong in that generation. social function. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Xu Guangping &quot;founded through free love and personal choice The marriage relationship actually caused her to lose her original independent status.&quot; In your observation, what are the significant similarities and differences between the situation of contemporary Chinese women in the workplace, marriage and love, compared with those during the New Culture Movement? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Kong Huiyi:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I don’t know much about the lives of the younger generation in mainland China, so it is difficult to make in-depth comparisons. All we can say is this: Human nature is basically the same, and this is largely the source of women’s distress. For example, everyone thinks that women are attentive and good at taking care of others, so the young and old in the family are all supported by women. Even in the West, the women&#39;s movement has been booming for decades. When a couple gives birth to a child, the financial burden of child care is too heavy. If one of them is required to stay at home to take care of the child, the woman will always resign or work part-time, and the man will be responsible. Raising children is a hit or miss, and the result is that when retirement comes, women&#39;s pensions are far lower than men&#39;s. When it comes to the female experience, financial issues always rear their heads. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for the differences between now and the May Fourth Movement, the main reason is that the social structure is different. The population has moved to big cities, and urban culture provides more opportunities for women. Population policy has also left many families with only one daughter. Now girls are treated much better. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;After nearly ten years of revising this book, what new understandings have you gained? and thinking? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Kong Huiyi: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;The first realization is to see your own blind spots, which are Jiang Dongxiu and Mahjong mentioned above. In addition, you can appreciate the role that details can play. For example, in the chapter about Xu Guangping, the new edition provides a lot of figures, including her salary in Guangzhou and prices in the 1940s, so the narrative is broader. Of course, the pursuit of details cannot be endless, and in the end you have to face the shortcomings calmly. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Passing through Shaxton was an opportunity to write a book.

Regarding Zhu An&#39;s written materials, except for her letters in her later years, they basically have to be filtered out from other people&#39;s accounts like gold mining. To understand the environment of her early life, one must rely on that one-week trip to Shaoxing. In addition, I was very moved when I read the original letters of correspondence between Zhu An, Xu Guangping and Hai Ying at the Lu Xun Museum in Beijing. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The other thing is that it was several years before I conceived this book. A Shanghai scholar accompanied me to the former residence of Lu Xun. When he stood outside the door, he said: This is also the former residence of Xu Guangping.

Investigations by the Public Security Bureau of Hangzhou City in Zhejiang Province and the Public Security Bureau of Kunming City in Yunnan Province revealed that Chen Yanban (also known as Bao Yanban) and Xiao Yankui (also known as He Chuntian) are important leaders of a criminal group involved in telecommunications network fraud in northern Myanmar. He has organized and opened fraud dens for a long time to carry out telecom and network fraud criminal activities targeting Chinese citizens. The amount of fraud is huge and the nature is extremely bad. It has been found that the criminal facts of Chen Yanban and Xiao Yankui are clear and the evidence is conclusive. The Public Security Bureau of Hangzhou City in Zhejiang Province and the Public Security Bureau of Kunming City in Yunnan Province have decided to publicly offer rewards for their arrests. The public security organs urged the criminal suspects Chen Yanban and Xiao Yankuai to recognize the situation clearly, step back from the brink, voluntarily surrender themselves, and strive for leniency. At the same time, we hope that all walks of life and the general public will actively report the crime and assist in the arrest of criminal suspects. For those who provide effective clues and assist in arrests, the public security organs will reward RMB 100,000 to RMB 500,000. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/12/b66902f5091a00a278af19b7c2b64497.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;283&quot; height=&quot;348&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/12/b66902f5091a00a278af19b7c2b64497.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;253877&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span>;Suspect Chen Yanban (Bao Yanban)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot; https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/12/ad5acecebd6294fb46481dca103a3d0c.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;358&quot; height=&quot;441&quot; data -src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/12/ad5acecebd6294fb46481dca103a3d0c.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;253876&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span>;Suspect Xiao Yankui (He Chuntian)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 12 Oct 2023 19:55:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[输得起的郭宝昌]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258484]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-12 18:40:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/12/9e016650df2ccce6b9fb2a03776f8df6.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;1624&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/ 23/10/12/9e016650df2ccce6b9fb2a03776f8df6.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;253935&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;During the 1927 Hebei disaster, carpenter Guo Shaochen fled to Beijing with his wife and daughter. After Guo&#39;s death, his 10-year-old daughter was sold into the wealthy Le family, and at the age of 23, she was married to the 70-year-old Le Si master. The daughter had no children, so she bought Li Baochang, the son of a beggar, in 1942. (Baochang lost his father when he was young and was first sold to a family named Wu by his biological mother, and then sold to the Guo family by his third aunt for two hundred yuan). From then on, Li Baochang was raised in his &quot;natal family&quot;. The fourth master Guan Yue called him aunt, and his adoptive mother Guo Rong called aunt. It was not until 1953 that she changed her name to mom and changed her name to Guo Baochang. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Guo Baochang’s life before he was 12 years old is frozen in this short description of about 100 words. After that, after stepping into the mansion, he suddenly changed from a beggar to a &quot;superior&quot;, but he still had to experience the warmth and warmth of human relationships: in the third room, the adoptive mother Guo Rong was originally the girl who held the pet dog for the third old lady. After taking the position, she was careful in the cracks. , taught his son how to roll around in a crowd, and also helped him establish the ambition to &quot;do big things&quot;. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;&quot;The Gate of the Great House&quot;, which was written in four drafts, is like a miniature version of the Legend of Red Mansions in the late Qing Dynasty and the early Republic of China. In the play, Guo Rong becomes Xiang Xiu, his adoptive father Le Jingyu (the Fourth Master Le of Tongrentang) becomes Bai Jingqi, and Guo Baochang himself becomes Li Tianyi. Viewers are talking about the correspondence between the plot in the play and the traditional Chinese medicine family. He said frankly: The script is 30% false and 70% real, and there are still a lot of stories that have not yet been written. &quot;Such a national bourgeois family closely follows the changes of the times and the political situation, and the relationships between the family characters are also constantly changing. If I have the ability to write it down and make some film and television works, it can better reflect the impact of history on human nature. ”&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Compared with the prominent relatives in the house, Guo Baochang cares more about the little people who are rarely looked at carefully: Master Wang, the bodyguard who taught him real kung fu, the down-and-out San&#39;er, the lively and straightforward second sister Zhang Fei and the eccentric Gen Luobo, the gardener Qian Erye who makes cigarette paste and boils eagles, and the &quot;eldest brother&quot; whom he admires deeply but later goes to extremes...&lt;/ span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;They were like the leaves in the thick hardcover books he collected. &quot;I like to collect leaves. The leaves are calmer, indifferent, and unobtrusive than flowers, and the taste is a little lonely and bitter. The veins, textures, and patterns of the leaves are articles, history, and all living beings in the large forest family. They are easily ignored. The real past.&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/12/f37d28b50e2eca913e27b9de59bd0441.png&quot; border=&quot; 0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;1234&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/12/f37d28b50e2eca913e27b9de59bd0441.png&quot; data -key=&quot;253922&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;These little characters have become the protagonists in his collection of essays &quot;All Big Characters&quot;. The other protagonist is the author himself, who has gone through many ups and downs: he was admitted to the film school and excelled, but was labeled a &quot;reactionary student&quot;. He was reformed through labor and implicated his mentor Tian Feng, a life-long regret; after arriving at the Guangxi Film Studio, He worked hard to support the fifth generation of directors, paving the way for their collective guest appearance in &quot;The House Gate&quot; in the future. He wanted to write about the experience of the house gate, but the result was frequent changes. The manuscript was destroyed and rewritten several times, and it took 40 years of his life to finally come out. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The people in the house call him &quot;Master Bao&quot;, which is the old family identity. In the film and television industry, people use the honorific title &quot;Master Bao&quot; to respect his sincerity, seriousness, and heroic spirit. Mr. Bao, who is over eighty years old, has deeper bags under his eyes and white eyebrows, but his figure has not been compromised. He launched the Peking Opera &quot;Mansion Gate&quot; tour and continued to write books, but he showed no signs of enjoying a happy life. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Such a treasured master should always be satisfied? But he shook his head. &quot;I have never opened my arms in my whole life&quot; is not only talking about the second master, but also seems to be writing about myself, who is ambitious. For Guo Baochang, all his hard work and unwillingness in this life are not only to realize his ambition, but also to shed tears of repentance for his revered adoptive mother and mentor: &quot;Look, I know I was wrong. I hope you will be proud of me in the end.&quot; .&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;&lt;span>;The following is spoken by Guo Baochang:&lt;/span>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&lt;span>;&quot;I don’t think they &quot;Noble&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Actually, before I was 12 years old, the house door was quite mysterious to me. Occasionally, I would go in and let me eat fruit, or suddenly it would be said that it was the Spring Festival and fireworks would be set off, and someone would bring me in and send them out again. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;After my grandma passed away, my mother took me in, and I officially entered the house. The impression was very deep and I will never forget it in my life. Because I suddenly escaped from my poor family, I clearly realized that a new life had begun, and my identity was different: you could ask the kitchen to eat whatever you wanted, and people could cook it for you. I will give you a fixed pocket money every month. In the 1950s, I was given 40 yuan a month. At that time, a worker&#39;s salary was only 36 yuan a month. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/12/c2a5b9683c9a244f13dbc862682615f4.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;739&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/12/c2a5b9683c9a244f13dbc862682615f4.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;253921 &quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span>;Guo Baochang’s cadre school years&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Children from other families still When I was kneading mud in the courtyard, Master Wang, who taught me boxing, often took us shopping, buying big knives and painted faces, going to the overpass, drinking noodle tea, shaving our heads, and taking a bath. I also learned to smoke, drink, watch theater, boxing, watch ballet, and changed my bicycle one after another. My mother said: &quot;Without this skill, you won&#39;t be able to deal with those bastards at the banquet.&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;But in the end, I have no status in the family. Because people think you are a &quot;bastard&quot; and suddenly come in to share the cake. Although they call you &quot;Young Master&quot;, their family has family rules and cannot have children with other surnames. So I have a deep...not so much inferiority, but a deep resentment. In fact, no matter in terms of life, interpersonal relationships, or attitude towards servants, I look down on those young masters and ladies. I don&#39;t think those people are noble. This is probably directly related to my later acceptance of the party’s education. But I had to endure a lot of things that I was unwilling to endure, and grew up slowly in the eyes of contempt. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;My mother also knows it very well, so she must make me strive for success - the way to make me strive for success is not to let me study hard, do my homework, and take the college entrance examination. Teach you to be an independent, dignified person, to become a master, and to get rid of all kinds of servility. My resistance was very strong at that time, I just thought that I must be successful and I must be better than you. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;&lt;span>;(Is the adoptive mother neither humble nor arrogant to other people?) &lt;/span>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;She gave it to me The overall impression is to be vigilant at all times. I can say without exaggeration that in the entire family, except for the old man, almost everyone is her enemy. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Because she has the lowest status among the wives, why can a girl with a dog suddenly give orders? They were unconvinced and tried every means to carry out all kinds of destruction. She had to be alert to everyone around her at all times. Over the past few decades, she has always been in such a high-pressure state, which is not easy. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;I also hope that I can stand behind her, as the strength behind her, so that people will not dare to bully her. This is a big wish of mine when I was a child. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In 1953, this big family finally couldn&#39;t support it anymore. Each house owner bought his own house and established his own portal. The old man and my adoptive mother and I moved to Donghuamen, while my grandmother and her family moved to Luogu Lane. I wanted a pipa in the warehouse, but Miss Wen flatly refused and said in a very unpleasant way: &quot;It&#39;s not your turn to choose! You&#39;ve come to take advantage of me!&quot; As soon as the funeral was over, Wen immediately took the lead in negotiating with several housemates. The boss jointly listed the so-called &quot;ten crimes&quot; against my mother. To put it bluntly, they wanted money. My mother focused on the overall situation, kept things quiet, and listed the family property and distributed it equally among the houses. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;It is natural to divide money, but it is really spectacular to divide things. Let&#39;s start with calligraphy and painting, which are overwhelmingly displayed - no one wants Qi Baishi&#39;s or Chen Banding&#39;s paintings. Each room is allocated through negotiation based on the number of rooms. Then divide into fans, then jade, inkstones, snuff bottles, copybooks, furs, and materials. For three whole days and nights, there was a lot of traffic in front of the door, and no one looked tired. This is what is called when a tree falls and the hozens scatter. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/12/747c065c81d4ad01d34eefbc449f2b96.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;1234&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/12/747c065c81d4ad01d34eefbc449f2b96.png&quot; data-key=&quot;253924 &quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&lt;span>;Confess to my mother every day&lt;/span>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Of course my mother has her limitations. She looked down on Yang Jiuhong and called her &quot;Sister Yao&quot;. She also tried her best to hide my life experience. Later, she firmly opposed my making family affairs public. &quot;Isn&#39;t this exposing my family&#39;s scandal?&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p >;&lt;span>;You ask me how I feel about her now? Very complicated, more of a guilt. There are many photos of my mother hanging in my house. I walk back and forth every day and confess to her every day. Because I betrayed my mother, I once severed ties with her. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;At that time, I was undergoing labor reform at Nankou Farm and went home to celebrate the New Year. In order to get rid of my bourgeois background, I forced my mother to ask who my biological parents were. After she told me, I immediately went to the farm and told the organization my true identity. Unexpectedly, the management staff said: &quot;You grew up on exploited food. You have all the bones in your body, so your background has nothing to do with you.&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;I even forced my mother to do so. After handing over all her property and working for a long time, she agreed to give up half of her dividends. But I felt it was not enough, so I tried to persuade again. She felt hugely insulted and said to me: &quot;Don&#39;t you think it&#39;s disgraceful to have such a capitalist mother? You can disown me, make your own home, and live your life. I won&#39;t pay. &quot;I picked up my old school bag and left, which broke her heart. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;I had a lot of selfish motives at the time, and wanted to use her &quot;handover of property&quot; to perform meritorious deeds and alleviate the punishment brought about by my background. This idea is very strong, thinking that as long as we don&#39;t eat outside the house, my punishment can be reduced, which is also a sign of meritorious service. Looking back now, it was a dirty idea. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;&lt;span>;(Did you express regret before she died?)&lt;/span>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Repented, I just didn’t have time to express it. Why is it so difficult for someone to admit their mistakes? Why is it so difficult to apologize alone? I later learned that people like to gloss over their faults and refuse to admit they are clearly wrong. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The reason why I write and speak out is to let everyone know that I was once ugly. Everyone will have mistakes and shortcomings of one kind or another, but only by facing them can you be reborn. If you lose, you have to admit defeat. Don&#39;t grit your teeth and refuse to admit defeat. Knowing what we have done wrong is of great benefit to us in treating the world sincerely. Of course, I also think this is too cheap. If you admit it, will you redeem your mistake? No. I did a lot of things I shouldn&#39;t have done, and the damage caused was fatal. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/12/48f8a869ca997dae8ffa69867018d2d4.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;877&quot; height=&quot;1230&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/12/48f8a869ca997dae8ffa69867018d2d4.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;253925 &quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span>;Guo Baochang’s adoptive father Le Jingyu (also known as &quot;Le Jingyu&quot;), everyone in the family calls him &quot;the old man&quot; ”&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;I am more in awe of Mr. Le. Why didn’t I write a chapter for him in the book? Because everything was written in the TV series, &quot;Seventh Master&quot; is a role model for me throughout my life: when it comes to quitting smoking, a manly man will stop smoking if he doesn&#39;t want to, and he survives. Every time he visits my grandma, he doesn&#39;t have the airs of a big capitalist and is very peaceful. It wasn&#39;t until 1953 that he suffered from amnesia and collapsed. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;But when I entered elementary school and received a new education, I felt that exploiters like the old man were tyrants and hooligans. When I thought about this issue while writing the novel, I began to look at him through class analysis and no longer respected him. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;I don’t understand my mother’s obedience to him. For example, he suddenly said that I wanted to go to the street. At that time, he was already blind - he had cataracts. My mother helped him walk around the street and come back. In fact, he couldn&#39;t see anything. I thought it was superfluous, and I especially sympathized with my mother. Therefore, in the first draft of &quot;The Gate of the Mansion&quot;, I wrote the image of my mother as &quot;insulted and damaged&quot;. At that time, Hugo and Dostoyevsky had a great influence on me. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;One time when my mother was away, I took the old man’s hand and walked around the house. I said okay, look at the street and that’s it. Do you see it? OK, sit down. My mother slammed the table at that time, &quot;You dare to treat this old man like this, who are you?&quot; He has been such a hero all his life, can you treat him like this? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;When I was a child, I couldn’t understand why my mother wanted to marry you at such a young age. How can there be love? I do not believe. I thought it was just a matter of bearing the humiliation and having no choice but to be sold there as a maid, and finally marrying such an old man in order to survive and have food to eat. After this incident, I realized that my mother truly loved him. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;span>;&lt;strong>;“In old China, no matter how powerful women were, they were still empowered by men”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt; span>;You said the story of Miss Qin and Miss Wen is particularly embarrassing? Yes, even the editors can&#39;t create such drama. It is so colorful and bizarre, beyond the imagination of ordinary people. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Qin and Wenben are the two beautiful young ladies at the head of our house. Wen is very talented in art, plays the guqin well and has a sweet singing voice. When Qin was in school, she fell in love with a college classmate of her second brother. This person and his second brother had similar interests and advanced ideas, which made Qin know that there is another world outside. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/12/6983b099477946550d887ccd57d8b896.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1056&quot; height=&quot;1385&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/12/6983b099477946550d887ccd57d8b896.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;253928 &quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span>;Miss Qin (left) when she was a child&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Second brother In order to escape his family&#39;s arranged marriage, he resolutely ran away, followed this classmate to join the revolution, and joined the party. He did not enter the city with the People&#39;s Liberation Army until Peking was liberated. That classmate and Qin were privately engaged for life, but he was unable to stay in Beijing and soon followed the army south, and the two met and exchanged letters. As a result, Qin never received his letter, and it took more than half a year to realize that their correspondence had been seized by her mother. In the last letter, the boy said that Qin had probably changed his mind and had found another partner and got married. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Qin immediately raised his knife and struck at her mother. The old man hugged Qin and took away the knife. From then on Qin went crazy. Wen became surly, withdrawn, willful and selfish. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Later, Qin married a seventy-year-old man and a farmer in Daxing, because she could not support herself at all. After arriving at the Wen family to implement the policy, Qin went back to her natal family and asked her mother and sister to help her, but she was refused. After taking the five yuan donated by Wen and walking out of her parents&#39; house, she actually swung the knife again at night, intending to kill her mother and sister Wen. Qin died in detention a few days later. People say: &quot;Thirty years ago, Qin&#39;s ghost-headed sword was not cut off, but it was made up for this time.&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In this story, sisters, mother and daughter, Family love, money...all are in it. But it&#39;s not over yet. I never imagined that there would be a story later. In 1998, an unexpected guest came to visit and said he was Qin&#39;s son. It turned out that his father was not an official of the People&#39;s Liberation Army, but an official of the Kuomintang. He fled to Nanjing with the army and then to Taiwan. He did not know that Qin was pregnant. Qin gave birth to him in a foreign country and carried him to Taiwan, acting out the tragedy of searching for her husband thousands of miles away. As a result, because her husband had remarried, Qin had no choice but to abandon her children and return to the mainland. Qin&#39;s son has since respected Wen as a relative. When he was in Beijing, he accompanied Wen to see a doctor and took care of her. After returning to the United States, he still sent money to help Wen with her medical treatment. He placed all his thoughts and love for his mother on his aunt. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Wen lived to be 71 years old and never married. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/12/1be4b404dfa104f69cb919f6692dd3da.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;769&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/12/1be4b404dfa104f69cb919f6692dd3da.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;253929 &quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span>;Guo Baochang and Miss Wen&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Speaking of this Gratitude and resentment are normal in a big house. Every room has its own story, but Qin and Wen impressed me the most. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;I grew up among women because my mother was in power at the time. Her main target at home is the female relatives of each house. It is easier to control the fate of the entire family through such channels, so I have more contact with grandmothers, aunts, young ladies, and ladies. I have quite complicated emotions towards them. Like my mother, I have to treat every member of the family and every woman with a different attitude. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In terms of female consciousness, she has received various educations since she was a child, especially in Peking Opera. In plays like Wang Baochuan, she and the princess are both Xue Pinggui’s wives. In the end, it seems Both of them succeeded in making the decision, but in fact it was given by Xue Pinggui. I feel that the issue of women&#39;s rights has not been solved in China, let alone in our family. The story of Yang Jiuhong is very typical. She and Xiangxiu seem to have power, and they have always been in control of a family, which is still given by male power. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;But I really didn’t expect that among the thousands of comments on &quot;The Mansion Gate&quot;, Yang Jiuhong probably gave the most comments. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;I have never met the second grandma, but the prototype of Yang Jiuhong has indeed lived with me for 20 years. For example, my second grandma was not allowed to wear mourning when she was about to die. Countless people in the house told me about this. That is not an ordinary injury, because both cats and dogs must wear mourning. You are not worthy of it. You are worse than cats and dogs, and you have no dignity at all as a human being. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The second mistress also said that if you become a good person and redeem yourself, you are still a prostitute! When I was filming a movie some time ago, I asked the young people on the crew, I said, if you get married and have children, and your child brings back a prostitute from other places to get married, will you agree? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Let’s not talk about such profound principles, ethics and morals. Don’t talk about these, just use yourself as an example. Who can do it? Do you think this is feudal consciousness? It’s such a complicated issue. When any of us looks at any work or evaluates any character, we should not use formulaic explanations. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In the later years of Yang Jiuhong&lt;/span>;&lt;span>; (prototype) &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;, there was an old man in the front yard of our courtyard, who was very elegant and a gentleman. A man who likes to wear robes and often comes to our house to play. As soon as we went back and forth, our Yang Jiuhong fell in love with him. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Do you think that an old lady who has gone through so many ups and downs can have someone who really sits next to her and is willing to listen to her in her twilight years? No matter what she says, I will listen. She is already very satisfied without expressing her opinion. I can understand this emotion very well. But then something happened, causing a huge fuss, and she suddenly became the joke of the entire family. I am the only one who sympathizes with her very much. I am the only one who can sit and chat with her in the mansion and is willing to listen carefully to what she says. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;span>;&lt;strong>;Walking back and forth in the river of little people&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In the summer of 1963, I followed Fishermen go out to sea and &quot;catching fish&quot; in their fishing boats. &quot;Liu Zi&quot; is the river in the sea. The boundary of the river is the sea, the flow is hidden, but the color of the water is different. Only fishermen who have lived and died with the sea for many years can identify it. When they caught up with Liuzi, the fishermen spread dozens of miles of large rope hooks to catch fish. They all stripped naked and lay on the boat deck to enjoy the sun, waiting for the fish to take the bait. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Facing the sea, people are so small, and I can’t help but sigh, man, who do you think you are? ! I sang &quot;I am originally from Wollongong&quot; in the Peking Opera &quot;Empty City Strategy&quot;, and the boss of the boat squatted on the bow and cheered for me while shitting, which was full of poetry. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/12/42f5d33ae873ea35a3f771cfe0edfe3e.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;755&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/12/42f5d33ae873ea35a3f771cfe0edfe3e.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;253930 &quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span>;Revisit the mansion gate. The three windows behind Guo Baochang were the concierge, and Old Fart Zheng lived in them&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;At that time, I liked to stay in the concierge and the kitchen, listening to what they said. All kinds of family things are just like listening to stories. In this book, I just want to bring to the front these characters who impressed me deeply and cannot be represented in the script of &quot;The Mansion Gate&quot;, and give each of them a close-up. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;For example, Master Wang, the bodyguard who taught me martial arts, is not tall, has a shaved head, and always wears country boy shorts; he always walks close to the wall in the alley. , with his head lowered and not looking away, just looking at the road in front of him; his face was calm and courteous, his eyes were squinted and he was smiling but not smiling, always as if he was sorry for someone. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;When encountering a vicious desperado, Master Wang would rather lose some money than kill anyone. As the saying goes, &quot;if you can&#39;t help it, don&#39;t do it.&quot; I remember that one night, a dark figure walked quickly from the roof of the small courtyard in the northeast. It jumped up to the ridge of the upper room in the north house. When it reached the northwest corner, the black shadow stopped for a moment. He bowed slightly to the people in the yard, and suddenly the old man shouted: &quot;Reward!&quot; A servant handed a small bag with Da Yang to Master Wang, and Master Wang hung the small bag on the knife of Guitou Dao. On the tip, he swung upwards hard, and the bag was thrown towards the black shadow, and happened to fall on the black shadow&#39;s raised hand. The black shadow kowtowed on the ridge of the roof, shrunk and disappeared. It turned out that he was a passing thief who took the opportunity to greet Master Wang, a martial arts master. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;There is also a young man from an oil and salt shop who is good at painting landscapes, flowers and birds. He has also watched &quot;How Steel Was Tempered&quot; and &quot;Zoya and Shu&quot;. &quot;La&#39;s Story&quot; has too much in common with me. More importantly, he talks about benevolence and righteousness. He didn&#39;t think much of the people in the house, saying that everyone was the same and there was no distinction between high and low. He gave me a copy of &quot;The Story of Lenin&quot; and said that if you look at Lenin, he didn&#39;t bring his ID, and the guards still wouldn&#39;t let him in. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;There is also Mr. Zheng, who loves to eat and fart, and can do rough work. For many years, Mr. Qian, who is disabled, has trouble getting into the hut, so Mr. Zheng helps him. He wears his belt. I have never smoked, drank, or gambled my whole life. I have never watched plays or movies, so I just listen to books. He is that kind of country man who is simple, kind, thrifty, loyal, but ordinary and ordinary. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The people I have met in my life are indeed all kinds of people. Of course, the weirdest thing is my &quot;big brother&quot;. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;He is not my eldest brother, but a classmate in high school. The family is extremely poor, and even if the younger brother steals a piece of garlic, he will be beaten by the elder brother. He is talented and has unique ideas. We had a close friendship, but he never refused my help. He said that he was so kind to me because he saw me as a rare talent, so he would never let me fall into the hands of the bourgeoisie and must pull me into the ranks of the proletariat. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Later on, both of us experienced various ups and downs, worked hard, and went to prison. Compared with him, I have believed, worshiped, repented, and been cleansed. And he has always been so &quot;transparent&quot; and so pure. I really don’t know which one of us is the tragedy. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;But in his later years, the eldest brother actually made a 180-degree turn. Bewitched by others, he began to borrow endlessly, from home to friends, almost everywhere. I also lent it to him and didn&#39;t expect him to pay it back. The worst thing is that he did not squander the money himself. He did not enjoy it. It was all passed on to those scammers. I told him it was all a scam and to stop it. One time he went too far, and I kept scolding him for about an hour... His daughter said: Uncle Guo, can you please stop scolding my dad? There was nothing he could do. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/12/319713849bc3670c65412fa24e05f9b6.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;776&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/12/319713849bc3670c65412fa24e05f9b6.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;253931 &quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span>;The later &quot;eldest brother&quot; (the one who wears glasses) is almost a completely different person&lt;/span>;&lt;/p >; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;My eldest brother passed away a few days ago. He did not &quot;wake up&quot; until his death. Therefore, people&#39;s way of thinking cannot go to extremes. He has gone to one extreme since his youth, and then he has gone to another extreme and fallen down all of a sudden. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&lt;span>;&quot;Wealth&quot; at the cost of life&lt;/span>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Some people say I am lucky. Yes, my life has been full of ups and downs, and this is a great wealth. But this wealth comes at the cost of life. No one wants to repeat this kind of luck. This kind of struggle is not something ordinary people can bear. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In 1959, I was admitted to the Directing Department of the Film Academy and joined the Youth League. My status in the family suddenly changed dramatically. Most of the young masters and young ladies in the family are living the food of their ancestors and staying at home. People like me who are both academically and politically enterprising are considered very promising. In the words of those gangsters: &quot;Okay, Mr. Bao, college students are still in the party.&quot; Yes!&quot; Wen&#39;s attitude changed especially. It may be difficult for people today to understand, because such an environment no longer exists. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;A few years later, when I was studying in the fifth grade of the Directing Department of Beijing Film Academy, I was classified as a &quot;reactionary student.&quot; He went through four years of labor reform and four years of life and death supervision. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;After returning from the labor camp, I stood at Donghua Gate. After I came out, I stood on the street. I didn&#39;t know where I was going, or where my mother and other family members were. I had no idea that the rebels were already living in the front and back yards. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;After that, I was assigned to Guangxi for controlled use. Later, I gradually heard the news about the implementation of the policy, and the materials and deposits that had been confiscated were returned. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Looking back, the time in film school was the happiest time in my life. At that time, I really felt that there was a bright road ahead of me, paved with flowers, but suddenly I fell into hell. You were no longer a human being, and you lost even the basic human dignity. Suddenly a work &lt;/span>;&lt;span>; (&quot;The Mansion Gate&quot;) &lt;/span>;&lt;span>; comes out, and suddenly everyone starts to pursue you again. It&#39;s such a life of ups and downs. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;I wrote that I cried bitterly four times in my life, and the most painful thing was when Tian Feng passed away. It was the kind of crying, crying and squealing. &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;(Pause, face to one side, choked for a long time)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;At that time, Tian Feng was the director of the directing department of our school. He vouched for the school: &quot; I am from a working-class and peasant background, and I will reform him (&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;Guo Baochang)&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;&quot;. At that time, I was writing the novel &quot;The Mansion Gate&quot;, and two-thirds of it was confiscated after I had written it. I was charged with writing a book and biography for a capitalist. While waiting for the school to deal with it, I did the work of cleaning toilets, sweeping the theater, and weighing briquettes. One afternoon when I came out of the briquettes factory, I bumped into Teacher Wadafeng. Both of them had their heads lowered. He was so thin that he lost his appearance. I didn’t expect that that would be the last time we saw each other. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;It can be said that emotionally, I have not only been guilty, self-blame, and regretful for many years, but I have also been in a state of despair, helplessness, confusion, and confusion. I am really not happy about being &quot;rehabilitated&quot; because what is lost is lost forever. No amount of words or actions can make up for the guilt I feel towards the teacher. He gave me special training at that time and made small mistakes for me, including the fact that he took on responsibilities that he shouldn&#39;t bear because I did something wrong, which really made me miserable later. Later, everything I did was to strive for our teacher and not let him live up to his expectations of me. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/12/cffb27ac924d4ffdf78c586e6b32165a.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;810&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/12/cffb27ac924d4ffdf78c586e6b32165a.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;253933 &quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span>;Guo Baochang directed at the filming site of the TV series &quot;Dongsi Pailou East&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;span>;I also respect my mentor’s wife, Teacher Yu Hua. For a while I fell into sadness and frustration, and couldn&#39;t figure it out. In addition, after the reform and opening up, various ideological trends poured into the country, and I also made some strange remarks. She once said to me very sternly, &quot;You have been persecuted and feel aggrieved. This is understandable. Everyone has been through this.

You have to be different and learn to control your own destiny.&quot; Just when others are dawdling and don&#39;t know what to do, No matter how you go, you must persevere and still do your best.

(Southern Weekend reporter Zheng Dan/Photo)&lt;/p>;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;A meal served for 9 people, 13 dishes, and the average cash per person was 72 yuan. Wiping his mouth and getting up, another day passed by. &lt;/p>;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;68-year-old Hong Jianming stood in front of the neon-lit hotel lobby, watching old friends walking in twos and twos, supporting each other across the zebra crossing until they disappeared. He took steps in the darkness across the road. “他们都不知道我住在这附近，不想让他们知道。”&lt;/p>;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;他们，是洪建明在上海徐家汇的宜家餐厅认识的单身老人，冲着“多吃几个花样的菜”，每个礼拜二聚在一起吃饭。 Neither of them knew each other&#39;s names, and they seldom asked because there was no need. &lt;/p>;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;到宜家餐厅的单身老人，大多是想找个伴。 While they boldly express their love for the person they like, they can&#39;t help but be suspicious and wary out of self-protection, lest they suffer a loss. As time goes by, everyone has become acquaintances who maintain a sense of boundaries, and they get together just for fun. &lt;/p>;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;孤独，终归是这里的底色。 &lt;/p>;&lt;h4>;自留地&lt;/h4>;&lt;p style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;“缺乏一个老年人交流平台”&lt;/p>;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;初秋的上海阴雨连绵，但位于漕溪路126号的宜家家居徐汇商场人声鼎沸。 On the afternoons of Tuesdays and Thursdays, the young people dining in the restaurant on the second floor slowly dispersed, and crowds of elderly people poured in. &lt;/p>;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;2023年9月12日下午3时，南方周末记者初到宜家餐厅，一眼望过去，布置近700个座位的用餐区，被零散坐开的老年人完全占据，过道里始终有人走动，相互搭讪聊天。偶尔有人走到记者跟前，打量着年轻的新面孔问道：“是来找伴的不？”&lt;/p>;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;这是一处上海老年人自发设定的相亲角。 Xuhui Mall, opened in 1998, is IKEA&#39;s first store in mainland China. It&#39;s hard to explain how its restaurant came to be occupied by a group of singles. As long as you buy a cup of coffee for 7.9 yuan and get free refills, you can hang out in the restaurant with the mug in hand all day long. &lt;/p>;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;71岁的陈翠霞记得，18年前，徐汇商场还是一栋很小的两层楼，单身的她和姐妹6人来玩，底下商场兜一圈，发现二楼还有饭吃。 “这边蛮好的，完了以后我们就讲好，下次再来好不好？”&lt;/p>;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;后来，人越聚越多，最多的时候，三百多号单身老人聚过来，都是来找伴的，整个大厅得靠喊话沟通，“声音吵&lt;span>;得&lt;/span>;能把房顶掀翻”。 Someone suggested that everyone pick a day to get together. Tuesday is the big day and Thursday is the small day.

Among them, the number of elderly people living alone 300,600. &lt;/p>;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;宜家餐厅无疑成了他们排遣寂寞的一块自留地。每周二，一位90岁的老太太会乘坐456路公交，从三林出发，花40多分钟时间来到餐厅后，只是默默坐在角落看人头攒动；旁边另一位上了年纪的女人与老太太以姐妹相称，她用塑料袋&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 12 Oct 2023 18:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[“消失”的婴儿牵出代孕贩婴暗网：涉多名儿童与东南亚代孕妈妈]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258433]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-12 00:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot;

&lt;p>;中国居民食道癌、胃癌发生的危险因素主要是：热烫饮食、喜油炸食、腌制饮食、重盐食、三餐不定时和饮酒抽烟，特别是边抽烟边饮酒；而吃大蒜、新鲜蔬菜以及饮温茶是保护因素。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;食道癌是常见的消化道肿瘤，其典型的症状为进行性咽下困难，先是吞咽食物时有哽咽感、异物感，然后难以咽下干的食物，最后，连半流物甚至水也不能咽下。食道癌还会引发胸骨后疼痛，如果发生转移或侵犯邻近器官，被累及器官会不适和疼痛。通常可能侵犯喉部，引起声嘶，所以，嗓子不舒服，未必是说话说多了，也可能是身体的紧急信号。如果侵犯下段食道癌可累及胃食管结合部，可能引起呕血或便血；如果侵犯气管可引起呼吸困难或咯血。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;全世界每年约有30万人死于食道癌，中国是世界上食道癌高发地区之一，发病率与病死率都相对较高。发病率在全部恶性肿瘤中排第6位，死亡率约为第4位，平均每年病死约15万人。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;食道癌的发病因素很多，年龄、性别、职业、种族、地域、生活环境、饮食生活习惯、基因、炎症与创伤、微量元素，都有一定关系。从性别看，男多于女，发病年龄多在40岁以上，但值得警惕的是，近年来40岁以下发病者有增长趋势。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;从地域看，农村食道癌发病率高于城市。但这里的地域实质是经济发展水平。一般来说，在相对发达的地区，肺癌、结直肠癌、乳腺癌、甲状腺癌和前列腺癌高发，而在经济相对落后地区，则是消化道肿瘤如胃癌、食道癌和肝癌等恶性肿瘤高发。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;从单纯的地理分布看，中国食道癌高发区主要集中在太行山脉附近：河南、河北、山西、山东、安徽、江苏苏北区域。这种发病的地域性在癌症中很常见，比如鼻咽癌的高发地区就是广东、广西、福建、湖南等南方地区。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;还有一种地理分布，其实是基因分布。食道癌的其他高发区域与中原移民有关，包括四川南充、四川盐亭、广东汕头、福建福州等地区。这是因为特定人群带有易感基因。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;食道癌的高危因素，日常生活中最常见，可以总结为四个字：烟、酒、烫、腌。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;流行病学调查发现一些食道癌高发区居民吸烟相当普遍，一些地区居民不吸烟，食道癌则很少见。在嗜好吸黑檀叶烟和咀嚼萎叶的印度穆斯林、基督教徒和印度教徒中，食道癌发病率高，而无此嗜好的拜火教徒中食道癌则很少见。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;流行病学调查，还发现许多食道癌患者有大量饮酒史。英国和中国香港科学家调查了香港食道癌患者的吸烟及饮酒情况，经过详尽对比分析，发现饮酒可能比吸烟更容易导致食道癌发生。中国食道癌主要为鳞状细胞癌，吸烟与重度饮酒是引起食道鳞癌的重要因素，对于食道鳞癌，吸烟者的发生率增加3-8倍，而饮酒者增加7-50倍。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在我国食道癌高发区中，许多居民和食道癌患者都有好吃热食习惯。研究者测量了高发区居民的食物温度，发现可高达70℃-80℃，最高为80℃-88℃。这是一个非常烫的温度了。 75℃热水就可以导致小鼠上皮细胞变性，黏膜炎症和细胞核酸代谢受影响，所以长期过烫饮食造成的局部炎症和热刺激，可能是食道癌发病的促发或诱发因素。在日本，喜吃烫粥烫茶人群均有较高的发病率。除了吃烫的食物，暴饮暴食、快速饮食、干硬食，也会刺激食道，引发癌症。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;亚硝酸盐也是导致食道癌、胃癌的重要因素，长期食用腌制食物，亚硝酸盐摄取过量，也会导致食道癌。在食道癌高发区，粮食和饮水中的亚硝胺含量明显高于其他地区。六十多年前，胃癌是日本主要的癌症，在1970年代普及冰箱后，人们吃腌制的食物少了，日本胃癌发病率大幅下降。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;不过，食道癌虽然可怕，也是可以预防的，避免高危因素，如吸烟、重度饮酒，少吃腌制食品，少吃烫的东西，如果当地饮水质量不好，可以加装净水器。住在高发地区、年龄在45岁以上、有直系家属食道癌或消化道癌症病史，或其他癌症病史、有食道癌的癌前疾病的人，要进行食道癌筛查，可以早发现早治疗。 &lt;/p>;

It has been eight years since Central Huijin last increased its holdings in the four major banks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Based on the closing price on October 11, Central Huijin’s increase in its holdings in the four major banks was approximately 477 million yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to announcements from the four major banks, this increase in holdings is just the beginning.

It has strong capital strength and holds shares in nearly 20 leading companies in four major categories, including banking, insurance, securities, and comprehensive institutions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This increase in holdings of the four major banks is of great significance to insiders in the securities industry. It sends a positive signal of stabilizing the capital market. It is also expected to drive bank stocks back to the main line of China Special Assessment, and then achieve the rhythm of the sector. Large with small, the floor pushes the ceiling. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Operation again after 8 years&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;On the evening of October 11, Agricultural Bank of China, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, Bank of China, and China Construction Bank collectively announced that the controlling shareholders Central Huijin increased its A-share holdings by 37.2722 million shares, 27.61 million shares, 24.8879 million shares and 18.38 million shares, and planned to increase its A-share holdings in the next 6 months (from the date of this increase). It continued to increase its holdings of the Bank’s shares in the secondary market in its own name. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;How much is the amount of this increase? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Based on the closing price on October 11, the four major banks increased their holdings by a total of 477 million yuan. Among them, the highest is 136 million yuan from Agricultural Bank of China, followed by Industrial and Commercial Bank of China with 130 million yuan, China Construction Bank with approximately 117 million yuan, and Bank of China with 94 million yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The last time Central Huijin increased capital for the four major banks was in 2015, at a total cost of nearly 20 billion yuan. In 2015, Central Huijin increased its holdings in Agricultural Bank of China, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, Bank of China, and China Construction Bank by 1.255 billion shares, 1.014 billion shares, 1.810 billion shares, and 497 million shares respectively. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This has also led some market participants to predict that Central Huijin’s increase in its holdings in the four major banks is only the beginning, and the proportion of subsequent holdings may be further increased. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Central Huijin has strong financial strength. According to the 2023 semi-annual report, its total assets and net assets are as high as 6.71 trillion yuan and 6.21 trillion yuan respectively. Its operating performance is also remarkable, with operating income of 323.615 billion yuan and operating profit of 316.607 billion yuan in the first half of the year. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Affect geometry? &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Central Huijin has increased its holdings in the four major banks, and its market impact cannot be underestimated. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Yifeng, chief financial analyst at Everbright Securities, said that Huijin’s increase in holdings sends a positive signal to stabilize the capital market. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First of all, the four major banks have stable profits and high dividend rates, but they are at very low valuation levels. Huijin&#39;s increase in holdings demonstrates the controlling shareholder&#39;s confidence in state-owned financial institutions with low valuations and high dividends; secondly, the four major banks have a larger weight in the Shanghai Composite Index, and continued increase in holdings is expected to have net-breaking valuations but stable operations and dividends Companies with high profitability will form support, which will help boost market confidence; finally, the four major banks play the role of &quot;lead goose&quot; in credit extension, and this increase in holdings will also help convey confidence in the stability of my country&#39;s financial system. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the view of Ma Kunpeng, chief analyst of CITIC Securities Bank, this will drive bank stocks back to the main line of China Special Assessment, and then achieve large and small stocks, and the floor will push the ceiling. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Specifically, he believes that the four major banks are the cornerstone of the banking sector and have key guiding significance for the overall prosperity of the sector. They are also the core of the banking industry’s valuation system with Chinese characteristics. They are important for today’s increase in holdings and The proactive announcement of the willingness to increase holdings in the future and the entry of real money into the market are not only an overall support for the banking sector, but also a high degree of affirmation of the special valuation of banks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It suggested that we should attach great importance to the systematic revaluation of the banking sector starting from the special valuation of major banks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ma Kunpeng regards the special valuation of major state-owned banks as a systematic revaluation supported by real logic and believes that it has three major logical pillars: First, the risks of major state-owned banks in key areas such as real estate and urban investment Not high, significantly better than the industry average; secondly, historical bad debt has been completely cleared, and the full-caliber bad debt rate has fully reflected and digested the bad debt implied by the current valuation, and has peaked; furthermore, the ROE of major banks has been at the bottom, promoting The profit growth rate at the critical point of ROE recovery is very close to the current profit growth rate. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ma Kunpeng believes that on the one hand, the current macro economy is at a critical turning point for stabilization and improvement, and the macro turning point is more beneficial to major banks that are more biased towards sector beta. On the other hand, the main line logic of the special evaluation of major banks this year is also conducive to major banks taking the lead in performing. Therefore, unlike the previous rhythm of first anchoring the sector&#39;s ceiling valuation and then driving low valuations, this year&#39;s rhythm should be the opposite, first raising the sector&#39;s floor valuation and then pushing the ceiling higher. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 12 Oct 2023 15:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[我的一则班内社会学调查：为何现在的年轻人不喜欢回家了？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258419]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-12 14:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;A recent post is very popular. The original text says this, &quot;When you are helpless, you often have thoughts in your mind. I said &#39;I want to go home&#39;, but it seems that it is not the real &#39;home&#39; in reality, but a safe, comfortable place in my imagination, without pain and trouble.&quot; I estimate that the posters are most likely young people, and the people who post and comment on them are also mostly young. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Home, also known as home in English, is different from house, which is only a building with residential functions. Home is a word with obvious cultural and geographical color, often associated with family, family, affection, warmth, shelter, arms, harbor, etc. Going home, the so-called going home, is also full of positive energy, a sense of justice and legitimacy, such as &quot;go home often&quot;, &quot;rich or not, go home for the New Year&quot;, &quot;fallen leaves return to their roots&quot; and other popular This can be seen in the song titles or sentences. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For me, I must go home during holidays, especially long holidays. The simple truth is that it was very difficult for my parents to raise and train me as an adult. Now that they are older, I have no reason not to take the time to go home to visit and accompany them. In other words, if I don’t go home during the holidays and only play by myself or play with my wife and children, I will feel guilty and feel that I am a selfish and heartless person. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Times have changed, and today’s young people, especially those born in the 1990s and 2000s, have completely different understandings and perceptions of home and returning home. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;My sociological investigation&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;My nephew is a freshman. During this past holiday, he only stayed at home for three days and asked his friends out on the fourth day. Have fun. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I randomly asked the 18 people I teach, including sophomores and juniors, 7 of them &quot;did not go home during this holiday&quot; and 7 of them &quot;stayed home for 7 days or more&quot;. 1 person, 3 people &quot;stayed home for 5-6 days&quot;, 4 people &quot;stayed home for 3-4 days&quot;, and 3 people &quot;stayed home for 1-2 days&quot;. Among the 7 people who did not go home, 5 people directly expressed that they &quot;didn&#39;t like going home&quot; and 2 people said that &quot;I had other arrangements during the holiday, so I didn&#39;t go home.&quot; Among the 11 students who went home, 92% held the view that they “like to go home, but don’t like to stay at home for too long.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One conclusion is that the young people I observed do not like to go home very much, or do not like to stay at home for too long. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Considering returning home as a population movement phenomenon, even if it is a temporary population movement, we might as well borrow the push-pull theory of demography to explain: Going home proves that there is something attractive to me at home, which makes me Things that feel comfortable, this is the &quot;pull&quot;, pull me home; if I don&#39;t want to go home, don&#39;t go home, or want to leave home after a few days, there must be something I don&#39;t like at home that makes me feel The uncomfortable place, this is the &quot;thrust&quot;, pushing me away from home. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For young people, what are the main components of the “pull” to go home? &quot;It&#39;s holiday, I want to go home and eat something delicious&quot;, &quot;Studying at school is too stressful, I want to go home and rest for a few days&quot;, &quot;I miss my parents and want to go home to spend a few days with them&quot;, &quot;They It’s not easy to support my studies, so I have to go home and spend time with them during the holidays.” The students generally gave their answers in terms of emotional expression and feedback, as well as self-repair and relaxation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are obviously many &quot;push&quot; components of not going home, not wanting to go home, and wanting to leave home soon after returning home. Here are some of the answers I got, and I divided them into categories according to the content. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I have other more important arrangements: &quot;I traveled with my boyfriend during the holidays. We went to Xi&#39;an to watch a concert, so I didn&#39;t go home.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to save money ’s: “If I don’t go home, I can save a lot of money. For example, if I stay at school for eight days, it costs 500 yuan, but the high-speed rail ticket alone costs more than 500 yuan for me to go home. Not going home is a big deal for me. A kind of financial savings.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Those who feel that there are communication barriers with their parents, cannot talk together, or feel that they are not free and uncomfortable: &quot;Communicating with parents is obviously not as pleasant as communicating with roommates or peers. , my real sense of gain is also much different.&quot; &quot;I want to relax when I go home, such as watching a movie with my friends. I like to put on makeup before going out. My mother likes to keep asking, who are I with and what are I doing? , What time will you go home? I am very annoyed by it. I feel like I don’t have any freedom at home. I don’t like this feeling.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The most common ones are those who have thoughts about their parents’ thoughts, or want to get rid of their parents’ judgment on their own lives: “It was fine for the first two days when I went home. I ate the food cooked by my mother. I was very happy and relaxed, but Later, my parents, especially my dad, always asked me about my life plans and future plans, which made me feel even more stressed.&quot; &quot;As soon as I came back, my dad kept nagging me in my ears to take the postgraduate entrance examination and public entrance examination. , saying that a certain job has security and will be relatively stable in the future, and that that job is not good and has no future, etc., &quot;My mother gave me some instructions on how to find a boyfriend, telling me not to find a boyfriend in such and such a place, but to find a fellow villager. I&#39;m about to collapse.&quot; &quot;In the eyes of my parents, I am always a child. Once my ideas are inconsistent with theirs, they will think that I am disobedient, rebellious, and unfilial, and they will criticize me and scold me. &quot;I don&#39;t like this.&quot; &quot;My dad is a local teacher in our area. He wants me to return to my hometown to be a teacher after graduation, which will be stable and relaxing. The problem is that I don&#39;t want to go home, and I don&#39;t want to be a teacher.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is not difficult to see that among the various elements of &quot;push&quot; in the eyes of the students, the differences in ideological concepts and lifestyles between the two generations, parental authority, and (excessive) control of children&#39;s rights to free development and self-determination Intervention is the most obvious manifestation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, the acquisition and growth of students from professional fields has also made the parent-child relationship relatively tense, and conflicts or contradictions have become apparent. Some students said, &quot;I am studying sociology. I have a certain theoretical understanding of power asymmetry and discipline. When I went home and heard what my parents said to me, I clearly felt that their words were full of PUA, and their words and deeds reflected obvious power discipline. The traces of what I learned in school are vividly reproduced in my home, and this feeling makes me extremely distressed.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, some students also pay attention to strategies when communicating or confronting their parents. One student mentioned, “When my parents talk about topics I don’t want to talk about, such as finding a partner, my The strategy is usually to use other topics to divert the topic. I will say that I am very busy, I have to study, I have to study, I have no time to fall in love, etc. to prevaricate them. I generally do not have head-on or direct conflicts with them, and I will selectively avoid them. Something I don’t want to talk about”. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When the &quot;push&quot; is greater than or significantly greater than the &quot;pull&quot;, the realistic choice for young people is naturally that they don&#39;t really want to go home, or they want to leave home after they can&#39;t stay home for a few days. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“It’s OK to go home; it’s not OK to stay for a long time”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Generally speaking, most young people will not resist going home, but they are limited by the differences in thoughts and concepts between generations. , there are obvious differences in the understanding and cognition of some things and problems, which often leads to some problems when young people and their parents stay under the same roof for a long time. Young people have the mentality of doing more than doing less, so they choose not to Go home, or go home less often, or reduce the number of days you stay at home. In a nutshell, &quot;It&#39;s okay to go home; it&#39;s not okay to stay for a long time.&quot; This is the choice of most young people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for the students I surveyed, regarding the frequency or probability of going home during the holidays, I observed that: it seems that young people who were born and grew up in a good family or a wealthy family have a relatively low frequency, and those who think they are in a high position have a relatively low frequency. Parents who are powerful or well-connected will have more future expectations and life plans and designs for their children. They are more likely to overstep their authority and suppress and restrain their children more frequently. The latter will of course be more uncomfortable and less free. A classmate said, &quot;My dad always talks in a bossy and arrogant way. I hate it. &#39;You must take the postgraduate entrance examination&#39;, &#39;You must take the public examination&#39;, &#39;You don&#39;t need to spend time putting on makeup&#39;, &#39;You don&#39;t &quot;I always go out to drink&quot;, &quot;I have eaten more salt than you have traveled&quot;, &quot;If you don&#39;t listen to the old man&#39;s words, you will suffer a lot&quot;, I feel annoyed when I hear these words.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the contrary, for those families with average economic conditions, after the children come home, the main thing for the parents is to cook for the children and have fun with them. The atmosphere is relatively harmonious, and the communication topics are not involved or rarely involved. Children&#39;s future, children&#39;s real feeling is that they are comfortable and comfortable, and they feel no or little pressure. The holidays are real companionship for them, and they fulfill the original meaning of the holidays. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In real life, there are still a small number of young people who don’t like to go home. They have fierce arguments with their parents as soon as they come home. They show contempt for their parents. Even when they go home, they are locked up. They go out to watch movies and play games without any verbal or other communication with their parents. For families with average or poor economic conditions, some young people turn a blind eye to the objective fact that their parents save money on food and clothing to support their education and college. They think this is what parents should do and it is a matter of course. &quot;I am Your children, it is only natural that I spend your money.&quot; In their view, parents are synonymous with old traditions, old ideas, decadence and backwardness. Their strategy is usually to &quot;not work together if they have different paths&quot;, that is, to &quot;cut off the relationship&quot; in an absolute sense. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Obviously, such children are not grateful to their parents for their upbringing. Faced with such a child, the other parent naturally feels disheartened and laments that his fate is bad and his family is unfortunate enough to have raised such a child. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Problems with parenting styles&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Not to mention the remark about &quot;raising children to prepare for old age&quot;. Parents work hard to cultivate and support their children. As children, we must have a basic sense of gratitude. Bar? Why is it missing? What is the problem? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I think the root lies in parents and their training methods. Many parents think that the standard of a good parent is to provide their children with basic or relatively superior material living conditions. I will try my best to satisfy my children&#39;s needs. This is even what good parents are all about, but this is not the case. In the process of raising and educating their children, parents cannot stop at purely financial support, but also involve all aspects, such as the source of value and the arduous process of creating value. Parents are too doting on their children. They have always known to give and give away since they were young. Children, let them feel that the material conditions they have are taken for granted, and do not instill in them values ​​such as a sense of responsibility, equality of rights and obligations, and the other side of freedom is self-responsibility. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As children, they never know or understand how difficult it is for their parents to make money. Their parents do not give their children the opportunity to experience and appreciate the hardship of their parents making money. Another example is paying attention to the inner world of children and the psychological changes during their growth. Many parents think that it is enough to feed and clothe their children, but they seldom pay attention, care and concern to their children&#39;s spiritual world and spiritual life. They seldom pay attention to, respect and listen to children&#39;s way of thinking and ideas. This is a common problem in so-called &quot;East Asian families&quot;. The common point is that both parties only focus on or care about material supply and acceptance, and do not care about each other&#39;s psychology. State, especially no or very little attention to the other person&#39;s mental state and personality traits. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for the solution to similar problems, from an economic perspective, when young people grow up and become adults, they theoretically have their own economic and behavioral capabilities. Shouldn&#39;t they completely &quot;cut off the relationship&quot;? Okay, is it okay for you to support yourself now? Then repay me all the fees I paid you after you turned 18, and then talk about &quot;breaking up the relationship&quot;. This may sound harsh, but it is the truth. Parents are adults, and their children are also adults, so they should get along with each other according to the contract in the adult world. If you borrow something, of course you have to repay it. This is only natural. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In short, the question of whether young people are willing to go home, how often they go home, and how many days they stay home essentially refers to the relationship between young people and their parents. Young people and their parents have different values, different cultural levels, different starting points, and different life experiences, which will inevitably lead to different views and opinions. This is a normal phenomenon. In the process of communication or getting along, both parties should adhere to the basic principle of empathy, consider issues from the other party&#39;s perspective, respect the other party more, care more about the other party, especially respect and care about the other party&#39;s inner feelings and experiences, and advocate effective communication between the two parties. and communication to gradually resolve or eliminate the inner barriers and gaps between each other. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For those &quot;rebellious children&quot; or &quot;parasites&quot; who only know how to take without knowing anything in return or feedback, I think parents can consider reducing or even stopping the material support for their children. In the past, they only focused on the material aspects of their children. Conduct in-depth examination and reflection on the parenting methods that focus on life but neglect the spiritual world of children. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Finally, I would like to return to a concept from the perspective of anthropology - making a home. The corresponding English word is home making, which means that home is not natural or naturally generated. Home is more than just a physical level. It refers more to the social level. Home is the result of social construction. Home requires the joint efforts of parents and children to build, build and operate. Only parents and children adopt common behaviors, actions, consultations and Only through collaboration can a true home be formed, and only then can the home in young people&#39;s imagination truly exist. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(The author is a professor at the Department of Sociology, Guangzhou University)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010; &quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;(This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 12 Oct 2023 14:25:03 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
