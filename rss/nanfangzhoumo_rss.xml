Aerial videos circulated on social platforms showed that there was a large area of ​​charred land on the field, and the woods on one side were in a mess. A large number of trees were knocked down, and there were obvious signs of excessive fire. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The day before, an F-35B &quot;Lightning&quot; II Joint Strike Fighter had an accident during a routine exercise. The pilot chose to eject to escape in an emergency. After that, the fighter jet continued flying in a &quot;zombie state&quot; and lost contact over South Carolina. In order to recover the missing F-35B fighter jet, multiple U.S. military services and departments jointly launched a &quot;missing notice&quot; on social media to solicit clues from the public. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A bizarre incident involving a large-scale search for fighter jets has sparked heated discussions on the Internet, with many people finding it unbelievable. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;South Carolina Congresswoman Nancy Mace asked on social media: &quot;What happened? How did you lose an F-35? Why is there no tracking equipment? You have to ask the public to help find it. Fighters and turn them in?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Air force training bases are generally established in the suburbs of cities, and radar deployment cannot be comprehensive. When the aircraft stalls and is at a lower flying altitude, it is not uncommon for the radar to fail to detect the target. More What&#39;s more, the F-35B fighter jet has excellent stealth capabilities and its radar reflection surface is extremely small.&quot; Wang Qunhuai, a former naval officer, told Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, it is not unprecedented for fighter jets to fly away without pilots. There have been fighter jets that flew nearly a thousand kilometers long distances after losing control of the pilot, until they ran out of fuel and crashed in a foreign country. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;Where did the fighter jet go?&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&quot;If you have any clues that can help us find the F-35 fighter jet, please call the Base Defense Operations Center. &quot;On September 18, 2023 local time, the United States Joint Base Charleston released an &quot;Opportunity Notice&quot; on social platforms, which attracted public attention. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The missing fighter belongs to the 501st Fighter Attack Training Squadron of the 2nd Air Wing of the U.S. Marine Corps, which is mainly responsible for pilot training. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the afternoon of September 17, a US military pilot flew an F-35B &quot;Lightning&quot; II fighter jet and took off from Joint Base Charleston to perform a training mission. But not long after, the fighter plane suddenly had an accident, and the pilot chose to eject to escape at a critical moment. At about 2 p.m., the pilot landed safely in the Charleston community and was later taken to the hospital, but the whereabouts of the F-35B he was flying was unknown. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A spokesman for Joint Base Charleston told NBC that after the pilot ejected, the fighter jet was in autopilot mode, complicating tracking. Agence France-Presse reported that the fighter jet will continue to fly in a so-called &quot;zombie state&quot; until it crashes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is worth noting that an F-35 fighter plane was accompanying the flight at the time of the incident. But the pilot did not continue to follow the drone and chose to return to base. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the fighter plane disappeared, the U.S. military quickly joined forces with the Marine Corps, Navy, FAA, Civil Air Patrol and local law enforcement agencies in South Carolina to surround Moore, north of North Charleston. A three-dimensional search was conducted from the air and on the ground in the area of ​​Terry Lake and Marion Lake. In the evening of September 18, several search aircraft circled an area of ​​woods and farmland near the town of Starkey in Williamsburg County. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After a day and night of searching, a spokesperson for the U.S. Marine Corps confirmed that the wreckage of the F-35B fighter jet was found in a field in Williamsburg County. The crash site is about 129 kilometers from Joint Base Charleston. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“The F-35B combines many advantages such as stealth, short takeoff, and vertical landing, and has a high level of versatility and interoperability. It is one of the most advanced and popular fighter jets in the world. &quot;Shepard Media, a well-known British defense media website, commented. But it is such an advanced fighter plane that is known as the &quot;main killer of future air combat&quot;, but it has set off an Internet group ridicule in the United States of &quot;Where have the fighters gone?&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;ABC News contributor and retired colonel Steve Ganyard complained, &quot;Even though it is a stealth aircraft, it is really surprising that such an expensive and complex aircraft can disappear. Ridiculous.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;It is not as easy for radar to capture stealth fighters as people think.&quot; Wang Qunhuai pointed out that on the one hand, the air warning radar has a high elevation angle, and the electromagnetic waves emitted basically propagate in a straight line. It can be effectively identified only when it flies to a high enough altitude; on the other hand, the F-35B fighter&#39;s maximum flight speed can reach up to thousands of kilometers per hour, and it can fly hundreds of kilometers in a few minutes. Once the transponder loses its function, it is basically invisible to the radar. You can only search with your naked eyes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The F-35 fighter jet is equipped with a Longbo lens. Wang Qunhuai said that this is to deliberately increase the reflected signal and make it easier to be detected by air traffic control radar when landing. &quot;Of course, when stealth flight is required, the Longbo lens The lens will be retracted”. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Currently, the U.S. military considers the accident to be a Class A accident, the highest level of severity, but has not revealed the name of the pilot involved or the cause of the accident. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, this is not the first time that an F35-B fighter jet has suffered a Class A accident. Four months ago, an F-35B fighter jet of the US military stationed in Japan had parts falling off during flight training, and the fighter jet subsequently returned to the Iwakuni base. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;MiG-23 across Europe&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The mysterious disappearance of advanced fighter jets is surprising, but this is not the first time in history. The &quot;zombie flight&quot; experience of the MiG-23 fighter more than thirty years ago is more legendary than the F-35B. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1989, the Berlin Wall still stood high between East and West Germany, and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, headed by the United States, and the Warsaw Pact, headed by the Soviet Union, were in a tense confrontation in Europe. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to public records, on the morning of July 4th, Colonel Nikolay Skuridin, who had just finished his vacation, boarded a MiG-23 fighter jet as usual and flew from near Kołobrzeg, Poland. Take off from Bagiz Air Base. For this experienced pilot, this was just an extremely ordinary flight training. He did not expect that this day would be recorded in the history of world aviation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When Skuridin piloted the plane to climb to an altitude of 150 meters, he suddenly found that the thrust of the engine afterburner had dropped sharply. When he realized that the plane had begun to fall, Skuridin immediately reported it to the ground command center. Engine failure problem. After receiving the tower&#39;s instruction to abandon the aircraft and parachute, he decisively pressed the emergency canopy ejection button. The MiG-23 fighter canopy detached from the fuselage, and Skuridin was safely ejected from the cockpit. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Unexpectedly, the unmanned MiG-23 fighter jet did not die in the Baltic Sea as expected. Instead, it suddenly raised its head and climbed upwards under the action of ejection, and soon resumed normal flight. gesture, flying westward over northern Poland and across what was then the Democratic Republic of Germany (East Germany). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although the air defense radar stationed in Poland recognized the fighter plane, it mistakenly thought it was a routine training and its flight trajectory was not interfered with. In less than half an hour, the MiG-23 fighter jet entered the territory of the Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany) and was detected by the NATO warning radar deployed in Hamburg. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After receiving the alert, the NATO military command urgently dispatched two American F-15 fighter jets stationed in the Netherlands to intercept. Compared with the US fighter jets, which were waiting in a tight formation, this MiG-23 fighter did not make any evasive maneuvers and maintained its current speed and flew smoothly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When American pilots who were ready for air combat approached the MiG-23 fighter, they found that the fighter had no canopy, no pilot, and no ammunition. As a result, the NATO military command lifted the interception order and ordered two F-15 fighters to follow the MiG-23 fighters. Subsequently, the MiG-23 fighter jet flew westward through Dutch airspace and entered Belgium. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At 10:30 a.m. local time, 80 kilometers away from the Belgian capital, a MiG-23 fighter jet that ran out of fuel crashed into a house in the town of Kortrijk-Belleheim in western Belgium. Wim Dral, a 19-year-old boy who was sleeping, died. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At this time, the Soviet Union was looking for the wreckage of MiG-23 fighter jets in the Baltic Sea. It wasn&#39;t until they saw reports from Western media that the Soviet Union knew that its fighter jets continued to fly unpiloted for 79 minutes, traveling more than 900 kilometers across Poland, the Democratic Republic of Germany, the Federal Republic of Germany, the Netherlands and Belgium, and finally landed in Belgium. crashed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On July 6, Belgium protested to the Soviet Union over the plane crash. In the end, the Soviet Union paid approximately 625,000 euros in compensation to Belgium, most of which went to Dral&#39;s family. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Cornfield Bomber&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;&quot; Jedi encounter&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;生&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; Dayton, Ohio, USA, is the hometown of the Wright brothers, the inventors of the aircraft. It is home to the U.S. Air Force Museum, the oldest and largest military aviation museum in the world. According to the official website, the museum houses about 400 aerospace vehicles dating back to World War I. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among the various aircraft on display at the U.S. Air Force Museum, one of the F-106 fighter jets with a large delta wing design and a wasp-waisted fuselage does not seem to be conspicuous. But the legendary experience of its aftermath has been passed down orally from generation to generation of American pilots. They regarded it as a lucky fighter and affectionately called it the &quot;Cornfield Bomber.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On February 2, 1970, pilot Lieutenant Gary Foster took off in the F-106 fighter jet with tail number 580787. At the same time, three other F-106s took off. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is a routine tactical confrontation training that took place at Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana, USA. According to the original plan, Lieutenant Foster will form a team with one of the pilots and conduct a peer-to-peer air combat exercise with two other F-106 fighters. However, due to a problem with the drag chute of one of the aircraft, the originally scheduled two-aircraft confrontation project turned into a &quot;one-on-two&quot; &quot;battle.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But when Lieutenant Foster piloted the F-106 fighter jet to an altitude of 10,000 meters, the fighter suddenly stalled and fell into an extremely dangerous horizontal rotation state, and then rapidly dropped to an altitude of about 3,657 meters. Foster attempted the spin recovery procedure multiple times without success before ejecting himself from the cockpit of the aircraft. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Due to the weight reduction of the fighter plane after the pilot ejected, the center of gravity changed, and the explosive force of the seat rushing out of the plane pushed the nose of the plane downwards. The F-106 fighter jet got rid of the rotation and flew without warning. Under human control, it enters a stable gliding state and flies smoothly in a straight line at a speed of more than 300 kilometers per hour. And this is exactly the approach speed of the F-106 fighter jet for landing under normal conditions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Foster, hanging on the parachute, could only watch as his plane flew further and further away. He then landed in a nearby mountainous area and was rescued &lt;span>;by a local resident using a snowmobile&lt;/span>;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The F-106 fighter jet he was flying landed safely in a cornfield near Big Sandy, Montana after flying for a certain distance. It even perfectly avoided the center of the field during taxiing. Rock pile. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When the local police arrived at the landing site, the aircraft engine was still running normally and the radar was still scanning. One hour and forty-five minutes later, the F-106 fighter ran out of fuel and the engine automatically shut down. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Subsequently, technicians from the Logistics Center at McClellan Air Force Base in California arrived at the scene. They were surprised to find that except for a few meters of scratches on the belly of the aircraft, the damage to the entire fighter jet was minimal. One rescue official even said that if the damage was less serious, he would fly the fighter directly back to the base. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Wang Qunhuai&#39;s view, it is a rare thing for a manned fighter plane to land on its own without human control, and it is basically difficult to achieve. &quot;Aircraft landing is one of the most dangerous aspects of flight. It requires deceleration and descent to maintain the appropriate speed and altitude. The attitude and thrust of the fuselage must also be adjusted to adapt to the runway position and airflow conditions. If there is a problem in any aspect, it may Posing a threat to the landing of aircraft.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the &quot;War History Online&quot; website stated that the thick snow on the ground provided a buffer for the fighter planes to land lightly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the F-106 fighter was transported back to California, Air Force staff repaired it, and the fighter was subsequently put back into service. In 1979, Foster flew this fighter into the sky again to participate in training at Tyndall Air Force Base in Florida. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In August 1986, this F-106 fighter aircraft numbered 580787 was retired and subsequently donated to the U.S. Air Force Museum. A few years later, all F-106 fighter jets were retired from the U.S. military and completely bid farewell to the stage of history at the beginning of the 21st century. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 24 Sep 2023 17:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[超“潮”！杭州亚运会开幕式的中式浪漫细节]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257519]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-24 16:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;The evening of September 23&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The opening ceremony of the 19th Asian Games&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Held in Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/24/254915ccf2ad57ad9fd7a8bf4127acda.jpeg&quot; border=&quot; 0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;768&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/24/254915ccf2ad57ad9fd7a8bf4127acda.jpeg&quot; data -key=&quot;251769&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The opening ceremony was themed &quot;Tide Asia&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Presenting an epic picture&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https: //images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/24/d8965edd72e7460a1ad6640a1a391f41.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;998&quot; height=&quot;516&quot; data-src =&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/24/d8965edd72e7460a1ad6640a1a391f41.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;251767&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What are the romantic Chinese details at the opening ceremony? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Let’s take a look↓↓&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The five-star red flag and the beautiful rivers and mountains are in the same frame&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the opening ceremony, the five-star red flag entered the scene&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt; img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/24/113dfe346ea641241d9d713533e00e6b.gif&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;753&quot; height= &quot;424&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/24/113dfe346ea641241d9d713533e00e6b.gif&quot; data-key=&quot;251772&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Dang Mei The rivers and mountains and the five-star red flag are stunningly framed together&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This scene is absolutely beautiful! &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/24/21b1af400cf0fb531b1befc20cf1c3bc.gif&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;751&quot; height=&quot;422&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/24/21b1af400cf0fb531b1befc20cf1c3bc.gif&quot; data-key=&quot;251770&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;The whole place was excited!

Zhang Xinyang is 28 years old. After graduating with a doctorate, he worked as an external teacher at Ningxia Normal University. He resigned in August 2021. He is currently working on projects with friends to earn money. He said that he currently only has a few thousand yuan on his card. In the eyes of many people, this does not match his &quot;prodigy&quot; persona. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The video begins with a splice of two paragraphs. The first paragraph is what he said to his parents when he was 16: &quot;It was you who wanted me to stay in Beijing the most. You should work hard for this (buying a house).&quot; The second paragraph is that he now says, &quot;I am already very satisfied in life and have no desires. If I really need anything, I can just call my dad. They still owe me a house in Beijing. It should be worth more than 10 million now, (Reporter: Are they willing to give it to you?) So what if you don’t want to, you have to be willing if you don’t want to.” Then he grinned. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The intention of the splicing is somewhat obvious. Sure enough, after reading it, many people criticized Zhang Xinyang&#39;s remarks and values. As the discussion deepened, more and more people discovered that there were many secrets to the matter, and they felt more sympathy and regret for him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During the interview, the reporter asked him if he was a child prodigy. He said no and seemed very humble. However, the reporter asked him what his IQ was like and how it compared with Wei Shen and Liu Jiyu. He said it was around 140, &quot;should be at the same level, slightly lower than them.&quot; He was still very confident in his intelligence. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Is Zhang Xinyang a child prodigy? I think so. He showed extraordinary intellectual talent since he was a child, and then continued to skip grades. He was admitted to university at the age of 10, but his test scores could only pass two books. And his father seems to have an obsession. He wants to prove that his son is a child prodigy, and he wants his son to maintain his character as a child prodigy. He actually did not allow him to repeat the above 985 university. It seems that if he went to college a year later, the glory of the child prodigy would be dimmed. , this character cannot be saved. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The reporter asked &quot;If you had not taken the college entrance examination at such a young age, would it be possible for you to get into Tsinghua University and Peking University?&quot; He replied, &quot;It is unlikely, precisely because according to my intelligence, even in an ideal world Under the current situation, there is a high probability that it is a 985 university.&quot; This answer is very modest. If he waits a few years later to take the college entrance examination when his mind is more mature, it would be possible to get into Tsinghua University and Peking University, or it would be a good choice to go to the junior class of the University of Science and Technology of China. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First of all, in this way, you can make your knowledge system more complete and solid, and you can do better in the exam. Secondly, people with high IQ can be much better than their peers in terms of knowledge. However, their understanding of world affairs and human nature and social survival skills generally cannot be learned in advance and can only be gradually improved with age. This is not only important for interpersonal relationships. Relationships are crucial to personal mental health, and they are not irrelevant to the college entrance examination. For example, you need to have this understanding to write a good college entrance examination essay. No matter how high the IQ of a 10-year-old child is, the degree of socialization is incomparable with that of other 18-year-old classmates. It is difficult to write a high-scoring essay. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhang Xinyang went to college at the age of 10, and went to Tianjin Engineer College; when he was 13, he went to Beijing University of Technology for his master&#39;s degree; and when he was 16, he went to Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics for his doctorate. The undergraduate school was very responsible and focused on cultivating him. The tutor helped him contact a German school to study for graduate school. “They may be better at cultivating geniuses than us.” Because German schools stipulate that 14-year-olds can go to school alone. “We advised him to &quot;Father (wait one year)&quot;, but it seems that in his father&#39;s opinion, waiting one year will disqualify the child prodigy, and insisted that he should go directly to graduate school after his junior year. Just imagine, if Zhang Xinyang went to Germany when he was 14 years old, his life path would be completely different. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After that, he asked his parents to buy a house and studied for a doctorate at the age of 16. In 2011, his father asked him to stay in Beijing after graduation, so he asked his parents to buy a house instead. &quot;Originally, he wanted me to stay in Beijing the most. You, you should work hard for this (buying a house)&quot; caused an uproar in the public opinion. Everyone thought that a genius&#39;s ideological level was so low. Saying this reflects that Zhang Xinyang&#39;s understanding of human nature is not as good as his intelligence. Making counter-requests was actually a form of rebellion against his father&#39;s excessive control over his life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since then, the backlash, rebellion and backlash against my father’s actions have been out of control, and it took me 8 years to complete my PhD. If he had enough motivation, he might have finished reading it long ago. His resentment towards his father and his mentality of giving up and lying down made him lose the motivation to make progress. This is Zhang Xinyang&#39;s own tragedy and the tragedy of his family. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Now, Zhang Xinyang said this: &quot;Twelve years ago, I was keen on the household registration house in Beijing, but now it is completely the opposite, that is, I have no idea of ​​buying a house at all. Is it not good to have no job, no house and no mortgage? Do you think that because the name on the house book belongs to you, this house is really your home?&quot; The flat and angry mentality is clearly visible. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the interview, he complained about his father&#39;s extreme control over him and expressed how he would raise his children in the future: &quot;I don&#39;t want children easily. Once I decide to have children, I will support them throughout my life. As long as they do not violate national laws, he will You can do whatever you want to do. If he strongly expresses what I did at that time, then I will let him take this path.&quot; This is not so much a look into the future, but an indictment of his father and his mind. A portrait of an ideal father. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhang Yaohui, Zhang Xinyang’s doctoral supervisor, once said: Zhang Xinyang is indeed the best among his students, but he entered school too quickly, resulting in that his mind and psychology are not very mature. If he can determine If you are determined to learn and work hard in a certain field, you will definitely achieve great achievements in the future. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhang Yaohui felt that Zhang Xinyang had suffered too many setbacks, and felt pity for him, and gave him a piece of advice: &quot;At this age, you can no longer hesitate and make decisions about what to do. If you don&#39;t do anything else, just do (mathematics) ) This big problem has been solved. If you run out of talents, you can go into business, and maybe you can make a career. Don’t just lie down.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The problem is that Zhang Xinyang’s super high IQ is still there , but the enthusiasm is gone. Humans are animals of meaning. Without spirit, it is like losing their soul. I hope that Zhang Xinyang can let go of all the misfortunes of the past, find the meaning of his existence, and re-energize his strong motivation to make a difference without wasting his talents. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, I also hope that parents all over the world will give their children the space to grow freely and be wary of that kind of pathological control. Whether a child is a genius or a human being, every child has a purpose for coming into this world. Don’t interfere or manipulate too much. Only in this way can the child&#39;s personality and soul be protected from harm and shine with the beauty they deserve. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 24 Sep 2023 15:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[模特踩八仙桌拍宣传照惹争议，涉事方道歉]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257499]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-24 14:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;span>;Recently&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;“Shenzhen fashion is powerful &quot;The project team&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;released a set of promotional photos&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;However, this set of photos caused a stir&lt;/span>;&lt; /p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Many netizens are strongly dissatisfied&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The organizers of the project have encountered a wave of dissatisfaction&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span >;Unexpected public opinion storm&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;&lt;strong>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Recently, a set of promotional photos released by the &quot;Shenzhen Fashion Power&quot; project team caused Netizens are hotly discussing. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/23/0a2a397842c44445b0c68ed2aabf0bf7.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;661&quot; height=&quot;956&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/23/0a2a397842c44445b0c68ed2aabf0bf7.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;251734 &quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In the photo, &quot;the model stepped on the Eight Immortals Table of the Chaoshan Ancestral Hall to take a promotional photo&quot;, which aroused dissatisfaction among netizens, and the related topic once became a hot search topic on Weibo. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/23/0c87c834990b8752664db9a4bc014209.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;326&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/23/0c87c834990b8752664db9a4bc014209.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;251735 &quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Many Chaoshan netizens said that this is an ancestral hall where Chaoshan people recall their ancestral merits and unite the people of the clan.

They are halls and places for worshiping ancestors, worshiping gods, or establishing images of meritorious sages. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Ancestral halls first appeared in the Warring States Period. In the Han Dynasty, they were only tomb temples. From the Wei and Jin Dynasties to the Sui and Tang Dynasties, family ancestral halls appeared in the Song Dynasty, and after the Yuan Dynasty, ancestral halls for worshiping ancestors appeared. Ancestral halls are common throughout our country. As temples of blood worship, they have a long history and an indelible status. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>; Deeply influenced by Chinese traditional culture, there is also an obvious clan tradition in the Chaoshan area. Throughout the ages, Chaoshan people have built a large number of ancestral halls, which is the Chaoshan people&#39;s &quot;return to the original&quot; heart. The expression of &quot;respecting ancestors and respecting ancestors&quot;. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;There are many ancestral halls in Chaoshan area, including private ancestral halls, ancestral halls, family temples, and ancestral halls of famous sages and officials, represented by Hanwengong ancestral hall, distributed in four villages and six miles. An ancestral hall has a history, a culture, feelings, and rich and colorful stories. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The architecture, stone carvings, Chaozhou wood carvings, porcelain inlays and other crafts of Chaoshan ancestral halls are exquisite and exquisite. The genealogy and family history carried in the ancestral halls are closely related to the Chaoshan ethnic groups. In the hearts of tens of millions of Chaoshan people around the world, Chaoshan Ancestral Hall is the most important spiritual holy place to &quot;remember nostalgia&quot;. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;span>;What is the &quot;Eight Immortals Table&quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The Eight Immortals Table is also called the Square Table. When worshiping, Chaoshan people use it to place offerings and incense candles, and when doing happy events, it becomes a dining table. The Eight Immortals Table often appears in Chaoshan weddings, gardening, giving birth to boys and other happy events. The Eight Immortals table placed in the Chaoshan ancestral hall is mainly used to place sacrifices. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;span>;&lt;strong>;The project party urgently apologized&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Faced with the strong anger caused by the promotional photos&lt; /span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;CIQICHINA, the party involved, responded&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On September 21, the organizer of the project issued an apology statement on the Internet, apologizing The statement mentioned: All published content has been deleted and content rectification and reflection are being carried out.

For children, childhood without snacks is bleak, and for adults, life without snacks is incomplete. Simply put, snacks are all foods other than meals. On September 15, 2023, a study published in the &quot;European Journal of Nutrition&quot; pointed out that unhealthy snacks are counteracting the effect of healthy meals, thereby increasing the risk of obesity, stroke, cardiovascular and other diseases. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A research team from King&#39;s College London in the UK studied the snacking habits of 854 people and came to two-quarter conclusions. A quarter of people&#39;s daily energy intake comes from snacks, but a quarter of people offset the benefits of a healthy meal with unhealthy snacks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Overall, the UK is a country that loves snacking, with 24% of people’s daily energy intake coming from snacks such as cereal bars, pastries and fruits. Snack eaters (95%) eat an average of 2.28 snacks per day, of which 47% eat two snacks per day and 29% eat more than two snacks per day. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A quarter (26%) of those who took part in the study reported eating healthy meals but poor quality snacks such as biscuits, crisps and cakes. Just cancel out their healthy meals. The so-called healthy meals refer to foods recommended according to dietary guidelines, such as a balanced diet based on cereals. The daily meal should include cereals and potatoes, vegetables and fruits, livestock, poultry, fish, eggs, milk and legumes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Unhealthy (poor quality) snacks are highly processed and sugary snacks. The classification of snacks is now roughly divided into original product snacks, initially processed snacks and deeply processed snacks. The first two are healthy snacks and the latter are unhealthy snacks. Take the potato chips that Westerners like to eat as an example. If they are cooked potatoes or potato chips with a little salt, they are original and primarily processed snacks. If they are fried and baked with various seasonings and made into potato chips, they are deeply processed snacks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although highly processed snacks account for only 1/3 of the average person’s daily food intake, their impact on the body can offset healthy meals, resulting in higher body mass index (BMI) and higher visceral fat. and higher triglyceride concentrations, all of which are associated with metabolic diseases such as obesity, stroke, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. This is a classic example of bad money beating good money when it comes to nutrition and health. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For Brits, popular snacks are biscuits, fruit, nuts and seeds, cheese and butter, cakes and pies, granola or cereal bars. Among them, unhealthy foods are cakes, cookies, pies, donuts, pastries, candies, ice cream and frozen dairy desserts, while nuts and seeds are among the healthier snacks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Chinese people also like to eat snacks. In 2018, the &quot;Report on the Development of the Snack Industry in the Context of Consumption Upgrading&quot; released by the Ministry of Commerce of China pointed out that the total annual output value of China&#39;s snack industry has reached 2.21564 billion yuan. Although in recent years, snack manufacturers and sellers have promoted natural, whole grain, sugar-free, and additive-free snacks as popular labels for healthy snacks, unhealthy snacks are still flooding the market, including fried foods and pickled foods. , processed meat products (dried meat, floss, sausage, ham, etc.), biscuit foods (including all processed biscuits), soda and cola drinks, convenience foods (mainly instant noodles and puffed foods), canned foods, plums Candied fruit foods, frozen dessert foods (ice cream, popsicles, ice cream, etc.), barbecue foods. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Spice strips, a famous Chinese snack that is widely loved by people at home and abroad, is an unhealthy snack (famous diver Quan Hongchan said that she likes spicy strips the most, and some manufacturers even sent her snacks. A cart of spicy strips). This is a type of cooked food product close to gluten type. It is made from wheat flour and/or other cereal flours as raw materials, added with salt, oil and other auxiliary materials, and processed through ingredients, extrusion cooking, molding, seasoning, packaging and other processes. There are less than 10 kinds of ingredients, but more than 10 kinds of food additives, and some even 20 kinds. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This snack is high in oil and salt. A pack of spicy strips has a net content of 100 grams, of which fat accounts for 25 grams. According to the recommendations of the &quot;Dietary Guidelines for Chinese Residents&quot;, the average daily edible oil intake per person is 25-30 grams. The oil content in a pack of spicy strips is equivalent to people&#39;s daily fat intake. At the same time, a pack of spicy strips contains 7.3 grams of salt. Also according to the guidelines, the daily salt intake of healthy adults should not exceed 6 grams, children aged 2-3 should not exceed 2 grams, and children aged 4-6 should not exceed 3 grams. Children aged 7-10 years old should not exceed 4 grams. Elderly people over 65 years old should not exceed 5 grams. The salt content in a pack of spicy strips exceeds the recommended salt intake for adults and far exceeds the recommended amount for children. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For children, it is this kind of unhealthy snacks that develops their later eating habits and tastes, lays the foundation for year-round intake of unhealthy diets, and also contributes to cardiovascular disease, kidney disease, obesity, and diabetes. Hidden dangers have been laid. Of course, unhealthy snacks also rely on their addictive properties to attract people and affect their health. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another recently published study shows that highly processed foods, whether snacks or meals, rewire the brain&#39;s reward circuitry and activate the brain in a manner similar to cravings for cocaine. Highly processed foods can trigger addiction related to drugs or alcohol. One mechanism is that highly processed foods cause the release of dopamine in the brain (similar to amphetamine) and can lead to withdrawal symptoms (at least in children and teenagers), two hallmarks of addiction. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Highly processed foods contain large amounts of sugar, salt, fat, artificial colors or preservatives, and contain other ingredients such as hydrogenated fats, fillers and starches to maximize flavor (called optimal taste point), thereby attracting people to continue eating. Moreover, hydrogenated fat or non-dairy creamer (creamer) tastes better than natural milk. Many people like to add it to their coffee. This delicious agent is also widely used in processed beverages and makes people addicted. This kind of fat is more harmful and difficult for the human body to decompose, and will aggravate the development of vascular diseases such as arteriosclerosis. Processed fructose, which is sweet and delicious, is also commonly used in beverages such as hydrogenated fat or non-dairy creamer, which can increase the occurrence of metabolic diseases and lead to addiction. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course you have to eat snacks. The easiest way is to replace unhealthy snacks such as biscuits, potato chips and cakes with healthy snacks such as fruits and nuts. There are many healthy snack options, including fresh, natural foods. Vegetables such as cucumbers, tomatoes, cherry tomatoes, etc.; fruits such as strawberries, mangos, apples, pears, etc.; milks such as pure milk, sugar-free yogurt, low-salt cheese, etc.; beans such as sugar-free soy milk, tofu pudding, edamame, etc.; Original nuts such as walnuts, almonds, cashews, hazelnuts, pine nuts, dried fruits, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is not impossible to eat biscuits and pastries, but you should choose those made with low sugar, salt and grains. The time when you eat snacks is also crucial to your health. If you eat snacks after 9 pm, your blood indicators will be worse and it will have a greater negative impact on your health. Therefore, you should not eat or eat less snacks after 9 pm. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 24 Sep 2023 13:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[叙利亚总统19年后再访华：加深两国政治互信，寻求经济合作]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257517]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-24 12:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;On September 21, there was a gentle breeze in Hangzhou. As the plane landed at Hangzhou Xiaoshan International Airport, Syrian President Bashar Assad&#39;s visit to China officially began. This is Assad’s first visit to China in 19 years since 2004. During this trip, Bashar will also attend the opening ceremony of the Hangzhou Asian Games. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;China and Syria are both countries with ancient civilizations. From their connection through the “Silk Road” to the connection between the “Belt and Road” initiative and Syria’s “Look East” strategy, economic and cultural exchanges between China and Syria have continued to deepen. In fact, friendly relations will become stronger over time. What is the deep meaning behind Assad’s visit to China? How can China-Syria relations be further developed? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Recently, Sun Degang, director of the Center for Middle East Studies at Fudan University, and Wang Jin, associate professor at the Institute of Middle East Studies at Northwest University, pointed out to Nandu and N video reporters that Bashar’s visit to China not only hopes that China will continue to work on the reconstruction process of Syria There are also economic considerations in playing an active role. Wang Jin also emphasized that future exchanges and mutual learning between civilizations will be an important basis for people-to-people exchanges between China and Syria and an important guarantee for the development of bilateral relations. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;“This visit to China will help deepen political mutual trust between the two countries”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;According to the Syrian National News Agency, Bashar led a high-level delegation in On September 21, he set off for a visit to China and participated in relevant activities in Beijing and Hangzhou. Nandu reporters noticed that Bashar’s last visit to China was in 2004, which was also the first visit to China by a Syrian head of state since the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Syria in 1956. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/24/c2fb9eec2add497b898cc7fa7ac85d2d.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;432&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/24/c2fb9eec2add497b898cc7fa7ac85d2d.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;251764&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span>;Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Xinhua News Agency/AP&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;China and Syria have a profound friendship. Syria was one of the first Arab countries to establish diplomatic relations with the People&#39;s Republic of China and one of the sponsors of the restoration of China&#39;s lawful seat in the United Nations. Since the establishment of diplomatic relations 67 years ago, China-Syria relations have maintained healthy and stable development. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“The diplomacy of the heads of state plays a leading role in the development of China-Syria relations.” Sun Degang believes that China and Syria have the same views on safeguarding national sovereignty and territorial integrity, and also have a common understanding of the multi-polar pattern. Diplomacy has played an overt role in deepening practical cooperation between the two sides in many fields.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before this visit to China, Bashar had already visited Iran last year, and this year visited Oman, Russia, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia and China are the sixth stop of his visit since the civil war broke out in 2011. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After 19 years, Assad visits China again. What is the deep meaning behind it? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Currently, the world is undergoing major changes unprecedented in a century, and global peace and development are facing increasing uncertainties and unstable factors. Against the background of the &quot;reconciliation wave&quot; emerging in the Middle East, Sun Degang believes that the Syrian President&#39;s visit to China will help deepen political mutual trust between the two countries. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Bashar’s visit to China is first of all hoping to receive political support from China, including continuing to support Syria in safeguarding national sovereignty and territorial integrity, and continuing to play an active and constructive role in Syria’s reconstruction process. , to properly promote the reconstruction process in Syria.&quot; Wang Jin analyzed to the Nandu reporter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2011, the Syrian civil war broke out. Iran firmly supported the Bashar al-Assad government. The League of Arab States (hereinafter referred to as the &quot;Arab League&quot;) suspended Syria&#39;s membership. Saudi Arabia and many other Arab countries closed their offices in Syria. embassy, ​​Syrian diplomacy has entered a state of relative isolation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/24/0fdbc92fb640cd041da104ad87aabb0d.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;427&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/24/0fdbc92fb640cd041da104ad87aabb0d.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;251765&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span>;The war-torn town of Deir ez-Zor in eastern Syria, taken on September 10, 2013.

Sun Degang told Nandu reporters that Syria has always supported China’s “Belt and Road” initiative and the global development initiatives and global security initiatives, and firmly supports China on the South China Sea, Xinjiang-related issues and other issues; China also firmly supports Syria in safeguarding national sovereignty and territorial integrity, has upheld justice on many occasions in relevant votes of the United Nations Security Council, and defended Syria&#39;s national sovereignty and territorial integrity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Nandu reporter learned that as a permanent member of the Security Council, most of the vetoes used by China in relevant votes of the Security Council are related to the Syrian issue. China has always spoken out fairly and acted in accordance with the merits and in safeguarding the interests of the Syrian people. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;The &#39;reconciliation tide&#39; in the Middle East has brought peace dividends to Syria&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;On March 10 this year, Saudi Arabia and Iran reached the &quot;Beijing Agreement&quot;. The three parties signed and issued a joint statement announcing that Saudi Arabia and Iran agreed to resume diplomatic relations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;China is a sincere friend of Arab countries, and Chinese wisdom is constantly recognized by Arab countries. On April 29, when meeting with Zhai Jun, the Chinese government’s special envoy for the Middle East, Assad congratulated China on successfully mediating the resumption of diplomatic relations between Saudi Arabia and Iran, and believed that reconciliation between Saudi Arabia and Iran would have an important and positive impact on the international pattern and regional situation. Syria thanks China for its active work in promoting Syria to improve relations with other Arab countries, and welcomes China to play a greater role in maintaining regional peace and stability. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During the Syrian civil war, Saudi Arabia announced its severing of diplomatic relations with Syria in 2012 due to its opposition to the Assad government. Two months after Saudi Arabia resumed diplomatic relations with Iran this year, Saudi Arabia and Syria also announced on May 9 that the two countries had resumed diplomatic relations. Sun Degang told Nandu reporters that China has promoted the normalization of relations between Saudi Arabia and Iran, driving a &quot;tide of reconciliation&quot; in the Middle East and bringing peace dividends to Syria. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“With the resumption of diplomatic relations between Saudi Arabia and Iran, Syria’s relations with Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Turkey and other countries have further improved, and Syria’s external living space has been greatly improved. This will also help to enhance China-Syria relations, Deepen bilateral cooperation,&quot; he said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On May 10, Bashar was invited to attend the Arab League Summit Council meeting in Saudi Arabia. On May 22, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said that China congratulated President Bashar on attending the Arab League Summit Council meeting and on the reunion of the Arab family. Syria&#39;s return to the Arab League fully demonstrates that Arab countries&#39; strengthening of unity and cooperation through dialogue and consultation is the aspiration of the people and the general trend. It also fully demonstrates that Arab countries have the ability to take their future and destiny into their own hands. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Jin believes that China’s global security initiative has effectively promoted world peace and development. “We hope to form a new security concept around the world that does not sacrifice mutual security. Rather, they are concerned about each other&#39;s security and form a bond of common interests in cooperation.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;China and Syria have economic cooperation advantages&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;2011 After the turmoil in Syria, the economic and trade cooperation between China and Syria was affected. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2022, the bilateral trade volume between China and Syria will be US$427 million, a year-on-year decrease of 11.65%. Among them, China’s imports were US$20 million, a year-on-year increase of 124%; China’s exports were US$425 million, a year-on-year decrease of 11.93%. China mainly exports mechanical and electrical products, light industrial products, etc. to Syria. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Jin admitted to Nandu reporters that due to the long-term sanctions imposed by Western countries, there are certain difficulties in cooperation between Syria and China, and it is necessary to understand rationally and steadily promote economic and trade cooperation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to his observation, the prospects for China-Syria economic and trade cooperation are very broad. &quot;Syria is rich in natural resources such as oil and has a superior geographical location. It is adjacent to the Mediterranean Sea and is an important bridge connecting Europe and Asia. Therefore, China and Syria have very great economic cooperation advantages.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Nandu reporters noted that previous meetings There is no shortage of products from Syria at the CIIE. Damask rose is one of the oldest rose species in the world, and the essential oil extracted from it is called &quot;liquid gold&quot; by locals. At the CIIE booths, in addition to the fragrance of rose essential oil, there are also Syrian products such as olive oil and castile soap. Many Syrian companies feel the potential of the Chinese market at the CIIE. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;China-Syria relations have a long history. Aleppo and Palmyra in Syria were important cities on the ancient Silk Road. On January 12, 2022 local time, China and Syria formally signed the &quot;Memorandum of Understanding on Jointly Promoting the Construction of the Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road&quot;, and Syria officially joined the &quot;Belt and Road&quot; family. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Syrian political analyst and author Kosay Abido believes that the cooperation agreement between the two countries can be expanded to areas such as food, pharmaceuticals and technology. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Under the new historical conditions, China’s “One Belt, One Road” initiative is aligned with Syria’s “Look East” strategy. China’s participation in Syria’s economic reconstruction has become deeper and more substantial, and China-Syria relations have reached a new level. steps. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Currently, the Syrian government forces have controlled most of the land, and post-war reconstruction is on the agenda. I think the Syrian President&#39;s visit to China will focus on cooperation with China in practical fields.&quot; Sun Degang analyzed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Nandu reporters noticed that the Syrian Minister of Economy and Foreign Trade was also among the Syrian delegation visiting China. In this regard, Sun Degang believes that this reflects Syria&#39;s hope that China will leverage its infrastructure advantages in the reconstruction process of Syria, including transportation, electricity and other infrastructure construction. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;If the economically powerful Gulf Arab countries are willing to provide financial support to Syria, and China leverages its infrastructure advantages, relevant cooperation can steadily promote Syria&#39;s economic and social reconstruction.&quot; He said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, Syria had already shown its willingness to seek economic cooperation with China before visiting China. According to reports from the Syrian Arab News Agency and the Russian Satellite News Agency, on April 29 this year, when Bashar met with Zhai Jun, he specifically mentioned that it was becoming increasingly necessary to abandon the use of the U.S. dollar and that trade between countries could be settled in RMB. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Jin analyzed to reporters from Nandu that Syria’s visit to China also has economic considerations. &quot;Syria also hopes that China will provide more economic support and assistance, especially welcoming more Chinese investors to invest in Syria and participate in Syria&#39;s socio-economic reconstruction.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On February 6 this year, southern Turkey approached Two strong earthquakes occurred in the Syrian border area within 12 hours, and China actively provided assistance. &quot;China will also be an important force in improving people&#39;s livelihood in Syria in the future.&quot; Sun Degang believes that the Syrian President&#39;s visit to China, in addition to deepening political mutual trust and strengthening economic and trade exchanges, will also help China and Syria strengthen cooperation in health, education, sports and other fields. . &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;“Exchanges and mutual learning between civilizations will be an important basis for people-to-people exchanges between China and Syria”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;It is worth noting that Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Hua Chunying said on 9 It was announced on March 21 that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad will attend the opening ceremony of the 19th Asian Games in Hangzhou. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Asian Games is a sports event for Asian youth and an important platform for cultural exchanges. &quot;This is a very important moment.&quot; Wang Jin believes that Assad&#39;s attendance at the opening ceremony of the Asian Games will bring important opportunities for people-to-people diplomacy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Leaders gather at this international cultural and sports event to share each other’s views, and head-of-state diplomacy also adds luster to this international event.” He said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sports represents youth, health, and vitality, and is related to people&#39;s happiness and the future of the nation. It is reported that the Syrian team will participate in six competitions including wrestling, boxing, and weightlifting at this Asian Games. Athletes from China and Syria gathered together to add color to the diversity of the Asian Games. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;The Syrian president&#39;s coming to China to attend the opening ceremony of the Asian Games has sent a signal - he hopes that China and Syria can strengthen cooperation in the humanities field.&quot; Sun Degang told the Nandu reporter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;China and Syria are both ancient civilizations. The exchanges between the two countries were connected by the &quot;Silk Road&quot; and continue to this day. The &quot;Silk Road&quot;, called the &quot;Road of Semiramis&quot; by the ancient Assyrians, started in China and passed through the land of Syria to Europe and the Maghreb region. The Syrian Minister of Culture once said that this road has enabled the Syrian people and the Chinese people to get to know each other and established a bridge for cultural exchanges. Customs, beliefs, and lifestyles have also influenced each other. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Today, ancient Chinese silk fabrics and ancient porcelain are collected in museums in Syria. The &quot;Stele of Popular Chinese Nestorianism in the Qin Dynasty&quot; collected by the Xi&#39;an Forest of Steles Museum in China has ancient Syrian inscriptions... each piece is precious. Cultural relics bear witness to the long history of cultural exchanges and mutual learning between the two countries. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/24/cf852266838b78b9744c286623c27e8d.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/24/cf852266838b78b9744c286623c27e8d.png&quot; data-key=&quot;251766&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span>;Recently, the &quot;Syrian Ancient Cultural Relics Exhibition&quot; was displayed at the Guangdong Provincial Museum. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On July 20 this year, the &quot;Syrian Ancient Cultural Relics Exhibition&quot; co-organized by the Guangdong Provincial Museum and the China Cultural Relics Exchange Center was displayed at the Guangdong Provincial Museum. The exhibition brings together 210 pieces/sets of exquisite cultural relics from 9 Syrian museums including the National Museum in Damascus and the Aleppo Museum, as well as 4 Chinese museums including the Dunhuang Academy, the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Museum, the Xi&#39;an Forest of Steles Museum and the Guangdong Provincial Museum. It paints a picture of the magnificent civilization and history of ancient Syria. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Jin told reporters from Nandu that China and Syria are both countries with ancient civilizations, and exchanges and mutual learning between civilizations are of great significance to China and Syria. &quot;Both countries advocate dialogue among civilizations. In recent years, China has proposed the principle of exchanges and mutual learning among civilizations, which has been welcomed and supported by Syria and recognized by the Syrian government and people.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;China-Syria relations have been affected by the rise of Eastern civilization. The common attributes are closely linked, and the two countries have great potential for cultural cooperation. Syria actively appreciates China&#39;s global civilization initiative, which promotes mutual respect among different civilizations and breaks down the &quot;clash of civilizations theory&quot;, &quot;civilization superiority theory&quot; and &quot;Western civilization-centered theory&quot;. In Sun Degang’s view, China-Syria cultural exchanges are a vivid reflection of China’s global civilization initiative. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;In the future, exchanges and mutual learning among civilizations will be an important basis for people-to-people exchanges between China and Syria, and an important guarantee for the development of relations between the two countries. They will add luster to exchanges and mutual learning among world civilizations,&quot; Wang Jin said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 24 Sep 2023 12:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[羊奶、牦牛奶、骆驼奶……小众奶有号称的那么神奇吗？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257529]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-24 11:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Recently, the Shanghai Consumer Protection Commission selected 32 liquid milks with high sales for evaluation, including I don’t know if the results of some niche milk products may surprise you. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In recent years, with the development of the economy and the diversification of consumer demand, there are more and more milk varieties on the market. In addition to cow&#39;s milk, there are also goat milk, and the uncommon buffalo milk, &quot;Niche milk&quot; such as yak milk and camel milk. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On social media, these &quot;niche milks&quot; are claimed to have miraculous properties. For example, camel milk is said to be rich in high-quality protein, vitamins, calcium, iron, amino acids, taurine and folic acid. Regular consumption of camel milk can enhance human immunity and delay aging. The drinks of centenarians in Xinjiang are indispensable for camel milk. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another example is yak milk. Because yaks are distributed in high-altitude areas in Tibet, Sichuan, and Qinghai and are resistant to cold, low temperatures, and hypoxia, the dairy products they produce are known as &quot;natural concentrated milk.&quot; It is said that yak milk is rich in nutrients, such as lactoferrin, A2 protein, conjugated linoleic acid, etc. In short, it is higher than other cow&#39;s milk. It is said that &quot;drinking one cup of yak milk is worth drinking several cups of ordinary milk.&quot; &quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Under these publicity, &quot;niche milk&quot; has gradually become a new consumer favorite in the dairy market. On an e-commerce platform, the transaction volume of imported plant milk increased by 176% year-on-year in 2019, and the imported goat milk powder increased by more than 50% year-on-year. The market size of yak milk products has increased from 400 million yuan in 2014 to about 1.45 billion yuan in 2019. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So, are these niche milks so magical? This evaluation by the Shanghai Consumer Protection Commission answers this question to a certain extent. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Nutrition refers to the biotin that can be obtained from food and is necessary for the body. When people eat, food enters the body, is digested by the gastrointestinal tract, and absorbs the nutrients in it, supplying energy to the body, forming and renewing body tissues. Nutrition is divided into seven major nutrients: carbohydrates, proteins, fats, vitamins, minerals, water, and dietary fiber. In 1973, an expert committee organized by the WHO confirmed a total of 42 essential nutrients for the human body. Any one of these 42 species cannot be deficient, otherwise related nutritional deficiency diseases will occur. Therefore, whether something is nutritious can be quantified. For dairy products, the main function of drinking milk is to supplement protein and calcium, which are indicators that dairy products must be labeled. Then, the nutritional content of dairy products can be quantified through experiments and quantitative comparisons can be made. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This experiment by the Shanghai Consumer Protection Commission compared 32 niche milks, including 6 buffalo milk, 7 yak milk, 6 camel milk, 6 goat milk and 7 cow milk ( Milk is mostly mid- to high-end products), with prices ranging from 1.5 yuan/100mL to 25.4 yuan/100mL. The results show that the protein content of 32 samples is 3.0g/100mL-4.3g/100mL. Among them, buffalo milk and cow&#39;s milk ranked first and second in protein content, with average values ​​of 4.2g/100mL and 4.0g/100mL respectively. Goat milk had the lowest protein content, with an average value of 3.2g/100mL. In terms of calcium content, camel milk has the highest calcium content, with an average value of 164.0mg/100mL; followed by buffalo milk, with an average value of 152.3mg/100mL; goat milk has the lowest calcium content, with an average value of 123.3mg/100mL. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since it is a commodity, a very important indicator is cost performance. The average price of camel milk is relatively high, reaching 22 yuan/100ml, which is nearly eight times the price of buffalo milk, but there is no obvious advantage in nutritional value. Generally speaking, buffalo milk and cow&#39;s milk have relatively high calcium and protein contents, making them the most cost-effective products. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This result may be unexpected by many people, but it is reasonable. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the modern dairy industry, the breeds of dairy cows are slowly developed through long-term industrial production and technology; the breeding methods are also constantly developing towards improving the nutrition of milk; the cost of feeding is also Gradually reduced in the fierce market competition. This ensures that the milk we usually drink is the most cost-effective. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the niche milk industry is small in scale, relatively backward in development, and naturally not cost-effective. For example, yaks have a low degree of artificial selection and are primitive cattle breeds. Their reproduction mainly relies on free mating within the group, which may lead to population degradation and reduced production performance. The daily milk production of yaks is low and the lactation period is short. The average annual milk production is mainly for feeding calves. Although there is also scientific research and improvement, the investment in a small industry is definitely not much. So, to some extent, yak milk is destined to be expensive. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, to a certain extent, the nutrition of milk is not important, because the same protein and calcium can be obtained in lower-cost ways, such as eating eggs to obtain protein. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, there is a traditional understanding in China that the nutrients are all in the soup. Following this idea, one would think that liquid milk is rich in nutrients. But actually, the nutrients are in the solids. Under normal circumstances, the human body needs about 50 to 60 grams of protein a day. The protein content of 100 grams of protein powder is about 75 grams. In natural food, a pound of pork contains about 100 to 120 grams of protein; a pound of chicken breast has 150 grams of protein; and each ordinary egg contains about 6 grams of protein. In other words, 5 pounds of milk is equivalent to 1 pound of pork, and 7 pounds of milk is equivalent to 1 pound of chicken breast. Milk itself may not be a cost-effective nutritional product. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So, for a healthy person with normal financial status, protein deficiency will not occur. This small difference in the protein content of dairy products is simply unimportant and not worth the extra money. What&#39;s more, the nutritional needs of the human body in different eras are different. In the era of poverty, people lacked protein, fat, and sugar; in the current era of abundance, protein, fat, and sugar may exceed standards. What people lack are vitamins, minerals, and fiber, and what they focus on is nutritional balance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So, there is nothing wrong with drinking niche milk, but don’t place unrealistic hopes on it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 24 Sep 2023 11:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[杭州亚运会盛大开幕，电子烟花、数字点火仪式让人耳目一新]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257523]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-24 10:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;On September 23, 2023, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, the five-star red flag was displayed at the opening ceremony of the Asian Games The lighting effect when entering is Chinese red.&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/24/4ef85dd71d.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;719&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/24/4ef85dd71d.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251794&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p >;On September 23, 2023, in Hangzhou, Zhejiang, at the opening ceremony of the Asian Games, the lighting effect when the five-star red flag entered the venue was Chinese red. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;At about 20 pm on September 23, 2023, the opening ceremony of the 19th Asian Games in Hangzhou was held in the main gymnasium of Hangzhou Olympic Sports Center. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;On September 23, 2023, eight people including Sun Haiping and Guo Jingjing will serve as flag bearers of the Olympic Council of Asia.&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/ cms/medias/image/23/09/24/26640b53ec.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;719&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/ 23/09/24/26640b53ec.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251795&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On September 23, 2023, eight people including Sun Haiping and Guo Jingjing served as flag bearers of the Olympic Council of Asia. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;On September 23, 2023, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, artistic performance at the opening ceremony of the Asian Games. 1&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/ 23/09/24/b307bc106c.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;719&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/24/ b307bc106c.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251796&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On September 23, 2023, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, a cultural performance was performed at the opening ceremony of the Asian Games. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The opening ceremony was themed &quot;Tide from Asia&quot; and was divided into three major chapters: &quot;National Style and Elegance&quot;, &quot;Qiantang Tide&quot; and &quot;Hand in Hand&quot;, which symbolized In the new era, China is integrating with Asia and the world, rushing forward like a wave. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;On September 23, 2023, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, artistic performance at the opening ceremony of the Asian Games. 2&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/ 23/09/24/d8fc4e904c.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;719&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/24/ d8fc4e904c.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251797&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On September 23, 2023, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, a cultural performance was performed at the opening ceremony of the Asian Games. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;One ​​of the highlights of the opening ceremony of this Asian Games is that no physical fireworks will be set off throughout the event, and instead electronic fireworks will be set off through digital technology.

In this sense, it is of extremely important significance to sociology. The famous sociologist Tu Ergan discussed the relationship between bachelors and suicide, Marx and Engels wrote about the relationship between marriage and profit, love and profit, and Max Weber studied sex, even if these are not the core of their works.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Leave aside society. Study’s persistence in modernity. In fact, Eva Iros&#39;s works are all about her own confusion. A few years ago, when she was still studying for a Ph.D. in the United States, it was her boyfriend&#39;s birthday. However, she was financially strapped and could not afford to invite her boyfriend to a restaurant, so she had to do it herself. &quot;But when I wanted to cook for him, I realized I needed to buy candles, cook some fancy food, and I didn&#39;t even have a tablecloth. To create a romantic dinner atmosphere, I needed to spend money, and I didn&#39;t have any money at the time .&quot; Her first book later published, &quot;The Utopia of Consumer Romance: Love and the Cultural Paradox of Capitalism,&quot; was related to this experience. In the book, she focuses on the close connection between romantic love and consumer culture. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/wO6qeoIC9QkxpJ1sO1z55d0m29hmfIdYK68V3NV0.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;1563&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/wO6qeoIC9QkxpJ1sO1z55d0m29hmfIdYK68V3NV0.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251366&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As an Emotional Society Scientist, Eva Yilos has always been curious about changes in emotional practices and related ideas. In the 19th century, when love entered the public sphere from the family sphere, dating culture also emerged. At that time, European and American romantic literary works focused on describing people&#39;s unremitting pursuit of romantic love - &quot;Madame Bovary&quot; depicts a woman who pursues Romantic love escapes the family several times, but in the end the woman is in debt and has no choice; &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; writes about a pair of childhood sweethearts, Heathcliff and Catherine. Catherine decided to marry Edgar out of the consideration of being well-matched, and Heathcliff felt humiliated. He ran away in anger and returned to the manor a few years later for revenge. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Very different from this, contemporary love is often filled with more rational calculations. Eva Iros believes that the development of Internet technology has destroyed people’s pursuit of romantic love. “We no longer rely on bounty hunters or good luck harvested on Ferris wheels to find love, as we did before, but through cost-benefit analysis. Looking for a match.&quot; Today&#39;s popular dating software is probably the best example, as she wrote in &quot;Cold Intimacy&quot; (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 毷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Chinese translation in 2023 Published in April), &quot;Most of the magic of love is related to the scarcity of the partner&#39;s resources. As the saying goes, scarcity is the most valuable thing. This scarcity will in turn bring surprise and excitement. Compared with Under the circumstances, what dominates the current Internet is a surplus economic system and too many options, which forces the self to make choices and make optimal choices. Internet technology happens to integrate two ways of finding oneself: psychology and consumerism—fueling the need for people to find the best (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: italics, italics_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;financially and psychologically&lt;/span>;) deal for themselves.&quot;&lt; /p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/SyjPK1W4qQR6A6dtbCgz5qYOb9FGYSkoWlffmOpX.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot; 1596&quot; data-src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/SyjPK1W4qQR6A6dtbCgz5qYOb9FGYSkoWlffmOpX.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251365&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Our The interview started from the phenomenon of psychological counseling craze, and talked about the impact of the popularity of dating software on intimate relationships, as well as her role in &quot;The End of Love&quot; (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: italics, italics_GB2312, STKaiti; &quot;>;Chinese translation published in September 2023&lt;/span>;) refers to the &quot;negative structure of contemporary relationships&quot;, that is, &quot;whether freedom undermines the formation of meaningful romantic bonds.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She does not intend to point out that modern love is always unhappy.

The opportunity is often a breakup or setbacks at work or school. They expect to gain a better self through psychotherapy. But this often points to individuals blaming themselves - if the goal is not achieved, then I didn&#39;t work hard enough. You also mentioned in &quot;Cold Intimacy&quot;, &quot;If a woman keeps falling in love with those unpredictable or loveless men, then she can only blame herself. If she does not blame herself, she must at least learn to change herself. &quot;Why do everyone believe in this logic? What does this have to do with neoliberalism? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Eva Ilos: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;You asked a very good question. Why do some narratives have more adherents than others? Why are some narratives so powerful that it is difficult for us to think beyond them or explain what is happening to us? Let me try to give a few different explanations: &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First of all, psychologists and psychoanalysts have long known about organizing themselves into experts through degrees, certifications, and university courses. Through their organizational capabilities, they quickly gained legitimacy as a discipline that sought to heal, improve, and overcome disorders and deficits, perfectly suited to the core missions of modern institutions: to promote progress, promote moral reform, alleviate suffering, Increase happiness. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Second, modern institutions are fundamentally utilitarian, and psychology applies this utilitarian philosophy to the mind. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The third reason lies in the profound changes in society. All social relations tend to be democratized, which sociologists call social roles (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 毷体, 毷体_GB2312, STKaiti ;&quot;>;Reporter&#39;s Note: In sociological theory, &quot;social role&quot; stipulates a specific scope of a person&#39;s activities and the rights, obligations, and behavioral norms that are commensurate with the person&#39;s status. It is society&#39;s behavioral expectations for a person in a specific position&lt; /span>;) no longer plays a fundamental role. That is, people are fathers and husbands, mothers and wives, girlfriends and friends, but they don&#39;t know how to play their roles in them, and all of these roles come with people&#39;s personalities and true selves. This means we no longer have guidelines. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The demand for psychology comes not only from the disappearance of social roles, but also from the disappearance of clear guidelines and authority. Individuals should know from within who they are and what they should do. But the problem is, they often don&#39;t know what to do. Psychology is a practice of dealing with uncertainties: Who am I? what should I do? Should I prioritize happiness or responsibility? In a world pre-ordained by society and the divine universe, the answers to these questions are obvious. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/5RXnjGIsyIRQfkM8GJTfAJCw9jZOMTpqad9p4akl.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;961&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/5RXnjGIsyIRQfkM8GJTfAJCw9jZOMTpqad9p4akl.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251369&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Stills from the movie &quot;Love in the Evening&quot; &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The demise of traditional romantic love&lt;/h4 >; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;One ​​of the changes in modern love is the popularity of dating software, such as Tinder and Hinge , similar software is also very popular in China. People who use dating apps to date often complain about how instrumental it is—you have to introduce yourself and ask the same questions every time you meet someone new. You also mentioned in &quot;Cold Intimacy&quot; that some interviewees expressed a certain boredom and cynicism. Do you think this cynicism marks a radical departure from traditional romantic culture in modern online love? Could you please explain it in detail? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Eva Ilos:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;In 2016, dating app Hinge found that 1 in 500 swipes on the app exchanged phone numbers . That same year, the company further surveyed 300 of its users, revealing that 81% had never found a long-term relationship on any swipe-based dating app ( ;&quot;>;Data comes from &quot;The Atlantic Monthly&quot;&lt;/span>;). However, Internet dating sites have always been extremely profitable because of their ability to commodify the hope of meeting someone, and that hope keeps people willing to continue using them despite feelings of disillusionment. I think this oscillation between disappointment and resilience is at the heart of people&#39;s use of online dating. Yes, I think it does represent some departure from the traditional model of love, but it also wants to preserve the traditional model. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Objectively speaking, traditional romantic love occurs in a small social network. Many times, people know each other, either through their parents or reputation, and belong to the same circle. In comparison, the social relationships of online encounters are more diffuse. Another change is that people’s choices have become incredibly wide. This is completely new and changes the ecology of human relationships. Generally speaking, we develop emotional attachments to others based on what we think is possible. If you live in a village you can only choose from this range. But if the choices expand, you think you have a better choice and quickly move on to the next person. Breaking up is also much less expensive because you think you can find someone who is your equal or better. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Is this departure just influenced by the Internet? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Eva Iros: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Technology cannot operate in a cultural vacuum. Without sexual liberation, people wouldn&#39;t have a variety of partners, and this departure wouldn&#39;t happen. Dating software has achieved and completed sexual liberation, changing the way people used taboos and morals to define sexual behavior in the past. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Imagination has always been a part of romantic love&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 凯体, 凯体_ GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;People who use social software to make friends have a more detailed definition of relationships and have developed many terms, such as hookups and FWB (friends with benefit), which refer to relationships that are both friendships and include sexual relations. They There are no commitments and constraints, and there is no emotional attachment), situationship (referring to the relationship between two people being closer than friends, but not to the level of lovers), etc. Why are modern people’s relationships more fragile and uncertain than in the past? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Eva Iros:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Simply put, it’s because we have the freedom to do what we want with our relationships and ourselves. Individuals are no longer defined by social roles and rules; they must create them themselves, which also creates chaos and uncertainty. Chaos and uncertainty are considered psychological categories, but I think they should also be sociological categories, because many situations in chaos and uncertainty are defined by individuals, and the rules of behavior of individuals are different from those of traditional society. The way things work is often very different. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;The traditional imagination of romantic love is based on the body The attraction is also based on accumulated experience in the past; and the Internet separates imagination from people&#39;s real encounters, allowing the two to occur at different points in time. Therefore, some people often face the dilemma of &quot;turning up as quickly as possible&quot; and then give up the idea of ​​using dating apps to find love. What kind of person can establish a private romantic relationship on the Internet? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Eva Ilos: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I’m not sure we can determine who can establish relationships in the network. Are you talking about being in a relationship with someone you have never met and will never meet? Or is it a relationship that begins online and continues offline? Imagination has always been a part of romantic love, and you will attribute many fictional virtues to the one you love. Sometimes people fall in love with someone they&#39;ve never spoken to. Laura and Petrarch are one of the most famous lovers in the history of the Western Renaissance, but in fact they almost never communicated. Petrarch loved Laura as one would love the Virgin Mary, or, in other words, he loved Laura as a teenager falls in love with a pop singer. The difference with the Internet is this - you already know a lot about this person, except for the most important thing: how their physical presence affects you. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Love, freedom, commitment phobia&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312 , STKaiti;&quot;>;Another dilemma of dating software is the difficulty in establishing a relationship between both parties. In &quot;Love, Why Does It Hurt?&quot; &quot;Although commitment phobia seems to apply to both men and women, no matter from a time perspective or a cultural perspective, commitment phobia is unique to men. In comparison, women are more willing to enter into relationships.&quot; committed relationship.&quot; What makes this difference? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Eva Iros:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Men cultivate power and control, which means they cannot allow themselves to be vulnerable. Women, on the other hand, are responsible for almost all of the caregiving work in society. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;In the above context, those who advocate sexual freedom Is the dating market exacerbating gender inequality? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Eva Ilos: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;It goes in contradictory directions. Encounters between opposite sexes became more sexualized, that is, sex was the goal and people&#39;s worth was largely determined based on their sexual attraction. A very attractive woman will have more power in the sexual realm than many men. But overall, the sexual realm is still dominated by powerful men who have control over young, attractive women. Trump and Melania are a classic example of what scholar Paola Tabet calls a heterosexual bargain: women STKaiti;&quot;>;preferably beautiful&lt;/span>;) provides sex, and the man gives her power (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;in the form of money or social connections&lt; /span>;). Traditionally, in the realm of sex, men have power and women have sex, and they trade. In a sexually free marketplace, the situation becomes even more complicated when there are no taboos or prohibitions on people accessing sex. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Modern love advocates love, marriage, and sex Freedom, which emphasizes that people have the freedom to enter into relationships, actually means that people have the freedom to leave relationships. You call it the negative structure of contemporary relationships. Although freedom is often given a positive connotation, this is not necessarily the case in intimate relationships. How do you view the relationship between love and freedom? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Eva Iros: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;The history of freedom is complex. When we talk about freedom, it is mostly seen in terms of political and economic aspects, such as natural human rights. Capitalist markets provide a lot of freedom for the circulation of goods and contracts between workers and capitalists. But there is also a history of emotional freedom that perhaps predates both previous histories: that of the individual&#39;s claim to autonomy from fatherhood, monarchy, and community, in which love plays an important role. Tristan and Isolde or Romeo and Juliet survive in our classics precisely because they illustrate the process by which individuals gain freedom from community. In the West, love and freedom are synonymous, an affirmation of individual autonomy. But this freedom has become what I call the “negative structure of contemporary relationships,” which is the freedom for people to say no and refuse to enter a relationship. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Having studied the sociology of emotions for many years, do you think intimacy Is the only direction for relationships to become more negative and alienated? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Eva Iros:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I think we have higher demands on intimacy now: respect; expression of our true selves; education us; pique our interest. This far exceeds what we expected from it in the past. We get more intimacy from our relationships than we did in the past, but we’re also more attentive to our own emotions and whether we’re being respected—which can make relationships more fluid and easier to ignite ( explosive). &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(Thanks to Chen Meiyi and Huang Qiuye for their help with this article.
