The State Administration of Radio, Film and Television has thoroughly implemented the people-centered governance concept. We are determined to mobilize the entire industry to solve this problem as a political project, a popular project and a systematic project. At present, cable TV transmitted through cable TV networks, IPTV transmitted through telecom operators&#39; private networks, and Internet TV OTT transmitted through the Internet have formed three major systems. On the one hand, they meet the diversified needs of the masses. On the other hand, due to the diverse market entities Different levels of participation in TV broadcasting and charging have caused problems such as &quot;matryoshka&quot; charging, which has caused troubles to the people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A working group was set up some time ago to investigate and rank all 7 Internet TV integration platforms, 22 TV manufacturers, All IPTV and cable TV in 31 provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities conducted questionnaire surveys of nearly 10,000 users, communicated with the Central Cyberspace Administration, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, the State Administration for Market Regulation, the China Consumers Association and other departments, and listened to all parties involved in the industry chain. opinions and suggestions. On the basis of finding out the bottom line, we will fully promote the governance work in three stages in accordance with the overall planning, step-by-step implementation, easy first, then difficult, and pilot first. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the first phase, this year we will gradually reduce the fee package by 40% to improve consumption transparency. In the second phase, TV operations and charges will be standardized in the first half of next year. In the third stage, by the end of next year, the long-term management mechanism of the three major business systems of cable TV, IPTV, and OTT will be improved to ensure that the TV &quot;matryoshka&quot; charging problem can be &quot;cured and will not rebound.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The first phase of governance work has recently begun, and a total of 7 companies covering the three major systems have been identified: Beijing Gehua Cable, Shandong Provincial Network, Shanghai Mobile, Guangdong Telecom, Jilin China Unicom, Xiaomi TV and Hisense TV pilot unit. Guide and promote relevant enterprises to formulate reduction and consolidation of fee packages, increase subscription management pages, and optimize specific implementation plans for free zones. Among them, Gehua Cable has reduced 14 fee packages to 5, and Guangdong Telecom IPTV has reduced the original 10 film and television categories. The fee package is reduced to 1, and newly shipped Xiaomi TVs and Hisense TVs no longer have pre-installed APKs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is expected that by the end of October this year, the fee package of pilot units will be reduced by more than 40%. From November to December, centralized rectification will be carried out nationwide to reduce the overall fee package by 40%. TV &quot;matryoshka&quot; charges The phenomenon has been significantly improved. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 28 Sep 2023 16:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[凤凰传奇粉丝逆龄化？00后为何迷上父母辈偶像]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257629]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-28 15:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https:// feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange &quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 28 Sep 2023 15:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[大同校园欺凌事件惊骇舆论场：未成年人施暴为何没有下限？ 家长如何应对和预防？丨快评]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257823]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-28 14:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;The bullying incident of minors at Dacheng Bilingual School in Datong, Shanxi shocked the country. While everyone was shocked, they were also asking: Are some children born evil? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Perhaps, only if we go deep into the world of minors can we correctly and deeply understand the origin of such events. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First of all, why do seemingly weak and powerless children bully their peers? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, bullying has little to do with physical strength. Bullying is essentially a mentality and method. The purpose is to construct and establish a domination-obedience power relationship between the perpetrator and the victim. The mental pleasure that bullying brings to the perpetrator is a pleasure of dominance. There is no evidence that physically weak people have a weaker desire to conquer and dominate than physically strong people. On the contrary, in some situations, physically weak people have more incentives to pursue a sense of conquest and dominate others in order to make themselves appear stronger. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Weak physical strength is only relative, there is always someone weaker than him or her. Moreover, bullying by physically weak people often has a characteristic of grouping together. In the face of organized bullying, it makes no sense even if the person being bullied is physically stronger. For these people, the pleasure of subduing a physically strong person and crawling at their feet is unparalleled. Therefore, when a group of physically weak people get together and bully others in an organized manner, they often leave videos to record their so-called achievements. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It should also be noted that violence by minors has nothing to do with gender. When the Datong incident caused unprecedented concern, Cai Yaqi, a real-name certified criminal law teacher, received a submission: a female classmate was bullied by other female classmates in the dormitory, and also had forced sex, and the perpetrator also took a video . Therefore, in cases of bullying of minors or even sexual bullying, do not rely on physical strength and gender. This will bias the understanding of the nature and causes of bullying, and lead to wrong prevention and response methods. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Secondly, bullying is a tool used to pursue a relationship of conquest and dominance. A newborn calf may not be inferior to a tiger. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Adults may often have a limit to bullying due to the need for &quot;face&quot;, moral sense or &quot;fighting without breaking up&quot;; minors, due to their immature minds, do not have so many scruples. Once bullying is committed, There is often no lower limit, enough to frighten adults and make people feel like some children are born devils. The other side of &quot;newborn calves are not afraid of tigers&quot; is not so beautiful. The transition of minors from bullying to sexual bullying and sexual violence is a reflection of this internal logic. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Any civilized society is to some extent based on sexual taboos and sexual shame. Even if modern society has broken some and relaxed some, it is difficult to change this fact. Taking the things that are most private and shameful to you, forcing you and humiliating you in public can break you mentally. The abuser has completed your mental discipline and achieved spiritual control over you. You become mentally a slave to your abuser. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The above two points constitute the occurrence of minor bullying and even sexual bullying. On this basis, we can have some coping and prevention methods. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First, specifically regarding the Datong campus incident, everyone noticed that the incident occurred in the school dormitory. It is very problematic for such a young child to live in school away from his parents. Of course, as the number of school closures decreases, the distribution of children will become increasingly sparse, resulting in an average distance for each child to go to school. At some stage, they may have to live on campus to save time commuting every day. However, if the child only goes to primary school, it is better to go to school nearby to ensure that the child goes home every day. Parents can also understand the child&#39;s situation and mental state at school, and any problems can be detected early. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Second, you must understand that the world of children is not innocent. Humans are social animals. In fixed interactions with two or more people in a stable environment with many people, there will inevitably be implicit or explicit hierarchical relationships, dominance and being dominated, or influencing and being influenced. relation. This cannot be eliminated. As long as it is based on the personality charm of the leader and the voluntary obedience of the followers, it is basically harmless. However, parents should pay attention to whether such relationships involve coercion and violence, and whether there is a qualitative change into a dominance-obedience relationship or a violence-victimization relationship. If such signs are discovered, they must intervene in time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Whether your child is a perpetrator or a victim, you should intervene and stop it. This is the approach of a decent and responsible parent. Never think that your child is the abuser and take advantage, then refuse to intervene, and then shirk responsibility and be irresponsible when other parents discover the problem. Children&#39;s behavior is likely to be shaped by the words and deeds of such parents and their subtle influence, which magnifies a family&#39;s educational failure into harm to other people and society. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Third, the sex education our children need most urgently is anti-coercion, anti-rape, anti-sexual assault, and anti-obscenity education. This should be given to children before they enter kindergarten and primary school. Repeated reminders and education should help children establish the awareness that: my body is private and sacred and cannot be touched by just anyone; if someone tries to touch their body, they should stop and report it to their teachers and parents; I My personality and dignity cannot be insulted. I have the courage to defend my body, rights, personality and dignity, and dare to say no to all bullying. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 28 Sep 2023 14:25:04 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[朝鲜决定驱逐非法入境朝鲜的美国士兵]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257784]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-28 13:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/27/77abcf1d4d861baae180de4765d5b010.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;515&quot; height=&quot;417&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/ 23/09/27/77abcf1d4d861baae180de4765d5b010.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;252490&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span>;US soldiers who illegally entered North Korea Travis King data map&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;CCTV News reported on September 27 that the Korean Central News Agency reported on the 27th that in response to the station incident that occurred in the Panmunjom Joint Security Area on July 18 The investigation into the illegal intrusion of Private Travis Kim of the South Korean U.S. Army into North Korea has been concluded. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/f8fb158a6b64d55f388ee18ea338fcb7.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;406&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/f8fb158a6b64d55f388ee18ea338fcb7.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;252491&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span>;Panmunjom Joint Security Area&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Reports stated that after investigation by relevant North Korean authorities, Telavi King confessed that he was disgusted with the inhuman abuse and racial discrimination within the US military, and was extremely disappointed with the unequal American society. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Reportedly, the relevant departments of North Korea decided to expel Travis Kim, an American soldier who illegally entered North Korea, in accordance with North Korean laws. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 28 Sep 2023 13:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[求职大学生为拿offer将学历改为高中：民营雇主为何拒绝“大材小用”？丨快评]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257746]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-28 12:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Recently, a job search news has attracted attention. According to &quot;Shangguan News&quot;, a newly graduated post-2000 college student said that he started looking for a job in early July, but he has never found a suitable job. Most of the jobs I wanted to take required work experience, and the hundreds of resumes I submitted came to nothing. He said that the requirements for the position are not high and the intensity is not high, and a monthly salary of 3,000 is acceptable. For this reason, he even thought about working in a factory as a general worker, but he could not find even this kind of job. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The college student involved admitted that this result made him feel &quot;a little embarrassed&quot;: after studying for so many years, he could not even find a job. In anger, he changed the highest education level on his resume to high school. Unexpectedly, when he opened the recruitment software the next day, there were dozens of greeting messages from HR. This news resonated with many netizens. Some netizens expressed their own opinions in their replies, saying that finding a job with a high school degree would make it easier to get a front-desk and promotion-type personnel/administrative job. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Judging from the situation of the person involved, he applied for these positions with a &quot;downward compatibility&quot; mentality. He is still looking for a job after graduating in early July, which means that he missed the autumn recruitment and spring recruitment in the past year, and had to turn to social recruitment, hoping to find a way out. However, it has been difficult for me to get out of the &quot;undergraduate position&quot; that I wanted. &quot;Hundreds of resumes have gone to waste&quot;, so I can only be &quot;downward compatible&quot;, &quot;even if I am a general worker in a factory, I can do it.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, these more &quot;downward&quot; employers are unwilling to recruit candidates with undergraduate degrees. The college student in question was &quot;downward compatible&quot; with these positions with the mentality of &quot;acceptable&quot;, but the employer did not favor this undergraduate with a higher academic qualification. An HR person even expressed his own opinion in the Weibo comment area of ​​this news, saying that the unit he works for must first screen out the highly educated undergraduates who come to apply for jobs, and give priority to applicants whose highest education is high school. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The college student in question applied for positions with “low requirements and low intensity” with a bachelor’s degree, but was repeatedly rejected. However, when he changed his highest degree to high school, he gained a lot of attention from HR. The question reflected in this news about &quot;voluntarily changing applicants with lower academic qualifications&quot; is why employers reject applicants with higher academic qualifications and better conditions on the grounds of &quot;overqualification&quot;. In fact, the employer&#39;s decision-making exactly reflects the laws of the market economy and does not violate the general principles of the job market. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The job market itself is part of the market economy and follows the market mechanism. Employers pay wages to employees in exchange for their work contributions. The two follow the principle of voluntary reciprocal exchange. Both employers and employees must consider the cost-benefit ratio. For employers, the principle of recruiting employees is to &quot;find the most suitable person&quot; rather than &quot;finding the best person&quot;; for employees, the principle of finding a job is also to &quot;find the most suitable job&quot; rather than &quot;finding the best person&quot;. good job&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So in this news, the employer obviously does not think that the college student in question is the &quot;most suitable person&quot;, because the applicants from the high school with the highest education are qualified for the job, and the employer pays to hire them Comply with market transaction principles. Private enterprises pay more attention to &quot;cost-effectiveness&quot; and &quot;fitness&quot; when recruiting people. There is no way to &quot;win by relying on more&quot; based on academic qualifications alone. If recruiting applicants with undergraduate degrees, the employer will have to worry about other risks, such as higher salary requirements, whether the applicant will &quot;leave after a short period of time,&quot; and whether he or she will obey the rules. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The employer’s concerns are not unnecessary, because they are also in line with the thoughts of undergraduate candidates. It can be seen from the news that the college students involved chose to apply for these &quot;low-demand, low-intensity&quot; jobs with a &quot;downward compatibility&quot; mentality: This job is not the best, nor is it the most suitable. Yes, it’s just the jobs that can be found at the moment. It is a rational choice for employers to reject &quot;overqualification and underutilization&quot; based on their own interests. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, &quot;backwards compatibility&quot; of candidates is not impossible. In addition to &quot;taking the initiative to apply for jobs with lower academic qualifications&quot;, it is also common to see in society that &quot;PhDs in nuclear physics from Peking University are admitted to the urban management establishment&quot;, &quot;Graduates from prestigious schools go to the street office&quot;, &quot;Masters and PhDs from prestigious universities gather for primary school teacher positions&quot;, etc. &quot;Real cases often trigger heated discussions in the public opinion field. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Compared with the &quot;sinking positions&quot; in the front desk and promotion in the news, the positions such as &quot;urban management establishment&quot; and &quot;street office&quot; can hardly be called senior positions, but these positions have successfully attracted highly educated talents. One thing the positions have in common is that they are all in the public sector. The public sector does not need to consider the problem of &quot;a small temple cannot accommodate a big Buddha&quot; like the private sector. This is also confirmed by the news about public examinations that appear frequently in the public opinion field. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, similar news also reminds that universities, parents and college students themselves should rethink the nature of higher education, avoid excessive investment that leads to negative output, and effectively improve their own position in the job market. Be competitive and find the job that suits you best. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 28 Sep 2023 12:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[8月全国彩票销售增长53.6%，前八月增长51.6%]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257760]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-28 11:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/27/3043A223FCE084B67B9B9B585B9FCD1AA.JPEG &quot;Border =&quot; 0 &quot;width =&quot; 862 &quot;height =&quot; 487 &quot;data-src =&quot; // Images.infzm.com/medias/image/2 3/09/27/3043A223FCE084B67B9B585B9FCD1AA. jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;252359&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;1.

At the Guangzhou Children&#39;s Park, children walked through marine life and played under dolphins and octopuses. However, the colorful colors at the bottom of the pool do not represent the colorful underwater world, but the oil spill. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A few months ago, the pool was still monotonous marble white.

In 2023, &quot;Promoting the continuation of the municipal children&#39;s park project&quot; was included in the work report of the Guangzhou Municipal Government for the first time. Since 2001, Shenzhen has released two rounds of ten-year plans for children&#39;s development, incorporating child-friendly city construction into the top-level design for the first time. Currently, Luohu and Pingshan Children&#39;s Parks have been opened, and Longgang Children&#39;s Park will also be completed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Being friendly to children means being friendly to the future of the city. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the &quot;Guiding Opinions on Promoting the Construction of Child-Friendly Cities&quot; by 23 departments including the National Development and Reform Commission, child-friendliness refers to providing appropriate conditions, environment and services for the growth and development of children, and effectively protecting children&#39;s right to survival and development. rights, rights to protection and rights to participate. Guangdong and Shenzhen were selected into the first batch of national child-friendly cities. In March 2023, 23 departments including the Guangdong Provincial Development and Reform Commission issued the &quot;Implementation Plan for the Construction of Child-Friendly Cities in Guangdong Province&quot; to promote the construction of child-friendly parks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;If we invite an environmental engineer to give a class, we will leave after reading the slides in the classroom. In the park, we let the children think about what humans have gained from the ocean and what they have given.&quot; Children in Guangzhou Yu Mingjie, deputy director of the park, told Southern Weekend reporters that the children understood that humans have also caused damage in the process of obtaining materials from the ocean. Even after the paddling pool was painted colorful, some children thought, &quot;Should we destroy or create?&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/a8jsOp74iGWTKdgd0Gc5eE5xTaQYkmWNp90suhEi.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/a8jsOp74iGWTKdgd0Gc5eE5xTaQYkmWNp90suhEi.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252533&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Children playing in the water in Guangzhou Children&#39;s Park. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern Weekend reporter Weng Huan/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;See the world from a height of one meter&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;What do children love to do in the park?

In the eyes of children, they are &quot;magical toys&quot; given by nature.

Adults are also easily attracted, &quot;a bit like the headlines of public accounts.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Nan Fangfang, head of the direction ecology team, introduced that these interpretive signs are designed according to the &quot;3-30-3&quot; rule: 3 seconds for children to become interested; 30 seconds to have a simple understanding of things; scan 2D code to gain more in-depth and detailed knowledge in 3 minutes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Explanatory signs in other scenic spots are only maintained once every 3-5 years. Pingshan Children&#39;s Park wears out much faster and needs to be updated every year. He is very happy, &quot;There are many people using the explanation, which is better than being deserted.&quot; &quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If you want to sum up the design idea of ​​the children&#39;s park in one sentence, it would be &quot;seeing the world from a height of one meter&quot;. When adults walk into the children&#39;s park, they feel as if they have entered the &quot;Land of Dwarves&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Adults have to bend down to see the maps and guidance signs clearly; soft rubber mats are laid in each play area, and rounded corners are designed in places that are prone to bumping. The &quot;Shenzhen Design Code&quot; also requires that: trash cans can be shaped like lively cartoons, and the height of the input port should not exceed 80 centimeters; the operating height of children&#39;s drinking fountains should not exceed 70 centimeters; both men&#39;s and women&#39;s toilets in public toilets should be equipped with children&#39;s toilets and men&#39;s toilets The proportion of inner low-level urinals in the total urinals should not be less than 50%, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/x1CfgQNQR5H1mBnOx4SuBDTq0J9nklGOU1EHjjWy.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1269&quot; height= &quot;1692&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/x1CfgQNQR5H1mBnOx4SuBDTq0J9nklGOU1EHjjWy.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252540&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Adults have to bend down to see the signs in Guangzhou Children&#39;s Park. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern Weekend reporter Song Bingchen/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the Guangzhou Children&#39;s Park, the open lawn surrounded by the big banyan tree is the Guangzhou Park The largest inner area.

Children are enjoying themselves in the park, and parents cannot just sit there and watch their phones overheat and shut down under the scorching sun. Moreover, many parents are elderly.

Compared with ordinary parks, children&#39;s parks have greater pressure on safety. A UNICEF survey of 35,000 children in 65 countries found that a quarter of children would feel unsafe in parks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Yafei works as an operations manager in Pingshan Children&#39;s Park, and has to &quot;fight&quot; with children climbing trees multiple times every day - there is a crooked tree next to the swing, which is the children&#39;s favorite. Preventing children from climbing trees has even become a key task for the park management staff. &quot;We will try to coax them a little at the beginning, and then we will be more stern. If it doesn&#39;t work, we will contact the parents.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Each project in Guangzhou Children&#39;s Park is equipped with staff. The number is slightly larger than that of other parks, with 60-70 people on duty every day. The park is also equipped with more than 40 emergency devices. Children can talk to the park alarm center by pressing a button. &quot;It is normal for children to get lost and look for their mother, 20 to 30 times a day.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To ensure safety, age or height restrictions on facilities are the most common methods. In Pingshan Children&#39;s Park, stainless steel slides and swings are suitable for those aged 4 and above, while more complex balance beams and climbing nets require those aged 6 and above 12 years old respectively. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Despite the regulations, it cannot stop children under age. In a net-climbing project, if you are not tall enough, it will be difficult to climb up to the last climbing point. There are often children who are half-climbed and their hands and feet are weak and dare not continue, so they have to be carried down by their parents. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/ziFDpqTKiUXj6dva8kdTe4msE9ocnzFWrypOyi3w.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/ziFDpqTKiUXj6dva8kdTe4msE9ocnzFWrypOyi3w.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252543&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The net-climbing slide in Pingshan Children&#39;s Park is difficult for children with insufficient physical strength and height to climb up. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern Weekend reporter Song Bingchen/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Children&#39;s parks will also receive contradictory complaints from parents. On the one hand, they want their children to play More facilities mean more experiences; on the other hand, there are worries about safety. This contradiction is also a question that Liu Yuelai, associate professor at the School of Architecture and Urban Planning of Tongji University, has been thinking about - should we just encircle the railings and make them the safest? He feels that how children overcome dangers and difficulties also needs to be taken into consideration. Child-friendliness is more important than caring for and taking responsibility for children, creating conditions for children to experience, practice and grow. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, adults often prevent children from stepping into puddles. If all puddles are eliminated, children will be bored. If some difficulties are designed, children can realize that they can overcome them, which is &quot;more important than adults eliminating all dangers.&quot; While ensuring safety, the water depth, slope, etc. comply with national regulations, which can enrich the park&#39;s landforms and provide more fun for children. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During the research, Nan Yishan also found that when it comes to snakes, children and parents are not curious, but afraid: there are no snakes in the park, right? Therefore, the commentary they designed begins with a child&#39;s voice saying: &quot;Snakes and humans have very deep misunderstandings about each other. When humans see snakes, they are nervous and afraid; when snakes see humans, they are frightened and frightened.&quot; This popularization of science focuses on how to communicate with snakes. What to do if you get along and get bitten by a snake. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Let&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;children participate in the construction of the park&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Few people know that the Nanyue King Museum is the former site of the Guangzhou Children&#39;s Park. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Guangzhou Children’s Park was first built in 1958. During the expansion in 1995, cultural relics of the Nanyue King were unearthed and moved to the junction of Renmin South Road and Yide Road not far away. Later, Guangzhou Baiyun Airport was moved and built in 2014. In 2006, it moved to the old Baiyun Airport land. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This &quot;Brief History of the Park&quot; inspired artist Chen Zhou. He taught at the Guangzhou Academy of Fine Arts and later focused on children&#39;s nature education. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Guangzhou Children&#39;s Park has an &quot;Art in the Park&quot; planning project. The purpose is not to hold an Internet celebrity exhibition, but to present the original intention, concept, process and results of children&#39;s art production. Chen Zhou took the children to visit the Nanyue Palace, imagining what the palace looked like more than two thousand years ago, and let the children build the kingdom in their hearts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The children found that the passages of the Nanyue Palace resembled an underground maze, so they designed passages using environmentally friendly materials to imitate the maze. Some passages can only be entered by children. Who is the King of South Vietnam and what does he look like? They thought they were ducks and birds, so they painted these patterns on the palaces they made. Some patterns even had the style of ancient house tiles. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;With multiple express boxes connected in series, the children built a time and space maze that connects the history and present of the children&#39;s park - the &quot;Growing Palace&quot;. After the palace was on display, Chen Zhou often received WeChat friend requests. Later, he discovered that a child posted his WeChat QR code on the palace. &quot;It was a child&#39;s prank. Some parents also added me and told me that the child was real.&quot; I really like this work.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/EzScAI2eA58ShksvdvX8CIxhUaCXBnHPTHgSs73O.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/EzScAI2eA58ShksvdvX8CIxhUaCXBnHPTHgSs73O.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252538&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;After visiting the Nanyue Palace, the children designed their own &quot;Growing Palace&quot;. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern Weekend reporter Song Bingchen/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The children&#39;s art exhibition attracted many professional artists to visit, and some hope to participate next year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child divides children&#39;s rights into three categories, one of which is the right to participate. However, according to the aforementioned UNICEF survey, only 26% of children said that the local government heard their voices. Opinion. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Children&#39;s parks have a similar dilemma. The stereotype of children&#39;s parks is that they are cartoony and colorful, even the bathrooms are colorful. Liu Yuelai has a different opinion. Sometimes there are colors everywhere, which is stimulating to children. Color is important, but the most important thing is the color of nature. &quot;For example, by observing how the colors of butterflies and sunflowers change, and immersing yourself in them, children will become more friendly to nature.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the construction of children&#39;s parks, children have a say and can even become the protagonists. Liu Yuelai found that children in fourth grade and above already have a very strong willingness to assert themselves and express themselves, and they have relatively strong spatial modeling abilities. In the process of participating in the construction of children&#39;s parks, children change from consumers to producers. “This kind of self-organization with order and endogenous dynamics is also an important experiment in civic education.” &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As users of children&#39;s parks, how children play game facilities determines the functions of the facilities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The aerial net bed in Pingshan Children&#39;s Park was originally used for children and parents to sit and relax, but children prefer to use it as a trampoline. At first, park managers advised everyone not to jump, but many people wanted to jump. After consulting the equipment manufacturer, moderate jumping is allowed on the premise of controlling the age and number of children and ensuring safety. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/a4U7H4gQyVegtGpOVo45wGZUctJ1cmroXTCSVHJk.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1269&quot; height= &quot;951&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/a4U7H4gQyVegtGpOVo45wGZUctJ1cmroXTCSVHJk.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252535&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Under the big banyan tree in Guangzhou Children&#39;s Park, the artist led the children to weave a &quot;Klein cocoon&quot; imitating the &quot;Klein bottle&quot; for everyone to hide and seek in it.

This question bothers parents. Behind the increased importance of children&#39;s parks is the reduction of children&#39;s activity space. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Houses in big cities are getting smaller, and even living rooms are getting smaller. “People don’t have much need to entertain guests, and children have even less space at home, so they can only go outside to play. .&quot; Wang Yafei observed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before coming to Shenzhen Pingshan Children&#39;s Park to work as an operator, Wang Yafei had been working in operations and management in residential and commercial institutions. After arriving at the Children&#39;s Park, his mentality was &quot;much younger.&quot; &quot;Children talk lively and cutely, which makes people feel relaxed. After being together for a long time, they feel a little childish.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are many residential areas around Pingshan Children&#39;s Park. Some children have become regular visitors to the park and come to play in the park almost every day after school. Over time, Wang Yafei and them have also become friends. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/FH0H73nDVXyLBmzgeslarsG4DpJiHqSKuCy1VCn2.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/FH0H73nDVXyLBmzgeslarsG4DpJiHqSKuCy1VCn2.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252536&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Pingshan Children’s Park Children’s Bookstore. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern Weekend reporter Song Bingchen/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Children will inevitably get bumped when playing in the park, and band-aids are always available in children&#39;s parks. At first, a box of 100 band-aids was enough for a month, but later it became less and less. At the fastest, it could be used up in half a month. Wang Yafei accidentally discovered that many children took away three or four band-aids at one time. Even when they were injured at home, the first thing they thought of was: There are band-aids in the park, so they went to the park to get them. Children&#39;s parks have become part of their lives. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Expanding the supply of public services for children&quot; is exactly the requirement of the &quot;Guiding Opinions on Promoting the Construction of Child-Friendly Cities&quot; issued by 23 departments including the National Development and Reform Commission. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, Liu Yuelai found that the &quot;appearances&quot; of children&#39;s parks are becoming more and more similar. &quot;It&#39;s a bit like houses built by developers. The apartments are all of the same type. The equipment used is nothing more than stainless steel, aluminum alloy or other durable plastics. There is no local expression.&quot; For example, park facilities in the northwest can have local characteristics and train children. The balanced tree stump does not need to purchase the same industrial products in the product catalog, but uses local elm trees, which can not only save costs, but also reflect the local culture. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Shenzhen Design Code&quot; also mentioned that plants should reflect the characteristics of Shenzhen. No less than 70% of the plants should be produced within 500 kilometers of the park and should be selected from plants with low maintenance, strong weather resistance, and resistance to pests and diseases. There are few native tree species, and an appropriate amount of exotic landscape tree species adapted to Shenzhen’s climate are selected. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tailored for children, it avoids &quot;competition&quot; for resources among different user groups. There are almost no other adults in the children&#39;s park except parents. Deng Xiaofei, a master&#39;s tutor at the School of Architecture and Urban Planning of Guangzhou University, believes that Guangzhou will build special children&#39;s parks in various districts with clear and professional functions, clear target service groups, and can better meet the needs of children. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But &quot;small&quot; and &quot;far away&quot; are the feedback Wang Yafei hears most from parents. The first phase of Pingshan Children&#39;s Park covers an area of ​​57,000 square meters, which is equivalent to 8 football fields, but it is only larger than the required area for a comprehensive park. Half of it is bigger. The small area will naturally make parents feel that their children are not having enough fun - an hour&#39;s drive from Futian is not enough to play. Why not drive 20 minutes more to the larger Huizhou Daya Bay Children&#39;s Park? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Even if Guangzhou has the largest cluster of children&#39;s parks, it is still not dense enough. Deng Xiaofei has done research on the children&#39;s park system in Guangzhou. If they only travel for half an hour, only a few people will be able to access children&#39;s park resources. Only if they travel for one hour can children&#39;s park resources cover the vast majority of children in Guangzhou. This is inconsistent with There is still a gap in Guangzhou’s three-level child-friendly living circle. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Guangzhou Planning Guidelines for Building a Child-Friendly City&quot; proposes to build a child-friendly living circle that can reach the entire area within 30 minutes by public transportation; relying on streets and residential areas, build a child-friendly life that can be reached at street level within 15 minutes&#39; walk. circle; relying on residential communities, we will build a child-friendly living circle that can be reached within a 5-minute walk at the community level. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Deng Xiaofei suggested that Guangzhou could increase the number and area of ​​children&#39;s parks in densely populated old urban areas and northern fringe urban areas. For old cities with a shortage of space, you can consider using idle or inefficient land resources, such as abandoned factories, to rebuild or expand the original children&#39;s parks, and set up children&#39;s play facilities in existing parks, squares, streets and other public spaces. , create children’s activity venues, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the first batch of Guangzhou&#39;s child-friendly series pilot lists released in August 2023, in addition to children&#39;s special parks, Liuhua Lake Park, Yuexiu Park, etc. were also selected. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Shenzhen also has similar ideas. The &quot;Shenzhen Action Plan for Building a Child-Friendly City (2021-2025)&quot; proposes to build more community parks and small-scale amusement parks, and expand sufficient children&#39;s game venues in city parks and community parks. By 2025, more than 100 child-friendly parks will be built. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 28 Sep 2023 09:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[高标准对接国际经贸规则，“应聚焦数字经济领域的制度型开放”]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257748]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-28 08:30:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/27/eOTBZFyizbruWq2svzV7bbVkt4RNFmNubK6t2GGa.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;719&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/eOTBZFyizbruWq2svzV7bbVkt4RNFmNubK6 t2GGa. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252344&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Shanghai Yangshan Deep Water Port is also an important part of the free trade zone. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“The top priority this year is to align with international high-standard economic and trade rules and promote high-level and comprehensive Institutional opening.

The introduction of &quot;Several Measures&quot; marks the beginning of my country&#39;s formal alignment with international high-standard rules such as CPTPP and DEPA in terms of substantive content. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The thirty-three articles of &quot;Several Measures&quot; are mainly based on the CPTPP rules. Some provisions are also reflected in the content of DEPA, such as DEPA Article 2.6 for six-hour customs clearance of express cargo, etc. Trade facilitation measures. This shows that the Shanghai Pilot Free Trade Zone has relatively mature conditions to apply these rules. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is reported that in practice, Shanghai has been at the forefront of the country in terms of facilitation of trade in goods. Recently, Shanghai has also highlighted this in the implementation plan for the implementation of &quot;Several Measures&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You once mentioned that compared with international high standards such as CPTPP and DEPA According to the rules, there is still room for further expansion in the scope of the digital economy content in the &quot;Several Measures&quot;. How should we understand it? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Pendre: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;There are two rules related to digital trade in the &quot;Several Measures&quot;, one is about online consumer protection, and the second is about Software source code disclosure issues. However, CPTPP Chapter 14 E-Commerce (Digital Trade) covers 18 items, and each item also contains different amounts. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, &quot;non-discriminatory treatment of digital products&quot;, that is, any Party grants digital products created, produced, published, contracted, represented or first commercialized in the territory of another Party. Treatment of products, or treatment of digital products whose authors, performers, producers, developers or owners are persons of another Party, shall not be less favorable than the treatment it accords to other similar digital products. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For another example, there is a rule in the CPTPP regarding the &quot;location of computer facilities&quot;: No Party shall require a covered person to use or set up computing facilities in the territory of that Party as part of carrying out activities in its territory. Conditions of business. Each party will also consider the issue of data security, so the CPTPP adds an exception to this rule, that is, nothing in this article shall prevent a party from achieving legitimate public policy objectives, which leaves a certain amount of time for each party to policy space. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the premise of protecting national security, more systematic considerations are needed on how to further align with international high-standard rules on non-discriminatory treatment of digital products and the location of computer facilities in the future. These provisions are also key provisions in DEPA, and they have an important impact on digital economic activities such as digital trade. Of course, this also provides space for the Shanghai Pilot Free Trade Zone to be implemented first. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Shanghai Pilot Free Trade Zone is in line with international high standards in the field of digital economy , what are the advantages? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Peng Delei:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Compared with other domestic free trade pilot zones, at present, the Shanghai Pilot Free Trade Zone mainly undertakes the function of institutional innovation. We should take the lead in aligning with international high-standard rules. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But there are many high-standard international rules. Taking CPTPP as an example, it covers 30 chapters including investment, e-commerce, and environment. If the Shanghai Pilot Free Trade Zone wants to benchmark every chapter at this stage, I think it will be difficult. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Judging from the conditions of the Shanghai Pilot Free Trade Zone, it is more advantageous to actively benchmark DEPA and focus on institutional opening up in the field of digital economy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First of all, the industrial foundation for the development of digital trade in the Shanghai Pilot Free Trade Zone is unmatched by other pilot free trade zones. Shanghai is an international economic center, financial center, trade center, shipping center and technological innovation center. Trade The foundation is mature, and the newly established Lingang New Area in 2019 is also actively exploring the construction of an international data port. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, Article 84 of the newly revised &quot;Legislative Law of the People&#39;s Republic of China&quot; stipulates that &quot;the Shanghai Municipal People&#39;s Congress and its Standing Committee shall, in accordance with the authorized decision of the Standing Committee of the National People&#39;s Congress, formulate the Pudong New Area &quot;Regulations, implemented in Pudong New Area&quot;, which also provides a legal basis and guarantee for the Shanghai Pilot Free Trade Zone to carry out pilot trials. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Shanghai Pilot Free Trade Zone should promote China’s accession in the field of digital economy High-standard economic and trade agreements provide practical support. What are the main obstacles faced at this stage? How to break through? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Peng Delei:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;The Shanghai Pilot Free Trade Zone actively benchmarks against DEPA, which has overall significance for China to join DEPA. The extent to which the Shanghai Pilot Free Trade Zone has adapted to DEPA and the problems it has encountered can provide an experience reference for China in subsequent negotiations to join DEPA. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At present, the Shanghai Pilot Free Trade Zone is still in the exploratory stage in the process of connecting with CPTPP and DEPA. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, in terms of cross-border data flow, national security must be taken into consideration, and risk assessment and prevention and control must be done when aligning with international high-standard rules. What risks are faced by the free flow of data, how big the risks are, and what impacts they will bring, definitely require more detailed and systematic consideration. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;You can break through from two entry points and gradually expand the scope of docking. First, we can consider learning from the negative list approach and research and develop an important data catalog. If this type of data is in the directory, the management specifications need to be stricter; otherwise, they can be relatively loose. Secondly, some qualified companies can also be allowed to pilot cross-border data flows. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;“We attach great importance to the construction of a digital trust environment”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: italics , Italics_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Since the establishment of the Lingang New Area, some explorations have been completed in promoting institutional opening up in digital trade. What are the highlights? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Peng Delei:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;First of all, the &quot;About Supporting Lingang New Films&quot; issued by the Lingang New Area Management Committee and the Shanghai Municipal Commerce Commission on August 30 Implementation Plan for the District to Deepen High-level Institutional Opening and Promote Innovative Development of Trade in Services (hereinafter referred to as the “Implementation Plan”). This is a comprehensive plan for the development of service trade in the Lingang New Area and has breakthrough significance. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among them, the &quot;Implementation Plan&quot; proposes specific measures for the safe and orderly flow of data and the innovative development of digital trade. For example, a data supervision sandbox pilot was launched to promote the implementation of a number of cross-border data cooperation projects such as electronic invoices and digital identities. The data supervision sandbox is equivalent to piloting some supervision measures on a certain subject in a region, and then judging whether it is suitable for promotion based on feasibility and effect. The implementation of electronic invoices and digital identities can improve trade efficiency and reduce business operating costs. These measures are actually the content of DEPA and are also the specific actions for Lingang New Area to align with international high-standard rules. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, Lingang New Area is also relatively advanced in the construction of digital infrastructure, such as the layout and construction of international communication submarine cable facilities, as well as the new National (Shanghai) Internet Exchange Center and international Internet dedicated channels. Construction etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;In the field of digital trade, Lingang New Area can take the lead in the future What international high-standard economic and trade rules should we try? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Pendre: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;In terms of benchmarking DEPA, there are two aspects that can be tried first. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First, strengthen cooperation among digital enterprises. DEPA’s chapter on “Cooperation with SMEs” mentions that “Parties shall engage in digital SME dialogue. The dialogue may include the private sector, non-governmental organizations, academic experts and other stakeholders from each Party”. It is recommended to establish cooperative organizations or conduct regular forums to promote exchanges between small and medium-sized enterprises and Chinese and foreign-funded enterprises, and the demands of foreign-invested enterprises in China can also be reflected through this mechanism. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Regarding the cross-border data flow issues that digital investors are concerned about, on the premise of ensuring national security, it can also solve the worries of foreign investors investing in China. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The second is to strengthen mutual recognition of digital enterprises. Article 4.2 of DEPA states that “Parties shall endeavor to mutually recognize the data protection trust marks of other Parties as an effective mechanism to facilitate cross-border information transfers while protecting personal information.” After mutual recognition of information and security is completed, if both parties need to conduct data flow or transactions, many procedural requirements can be reduced and costs can be saved, which is equivalent to establishing a white list for each other. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, Chinese-funded companies have previously been awarded the Data Protection Trust Mark (DPTM) by the Singapore Infocomm Media Development Authority. It is used to certify businesses that have deployed data protection measures to demonstrate that their operations comply with Singapore’s Personal Data Protection Act. Similarly, Article 12 of my country’s Personal Information Protection Law also contains relevant statements, which is to promote international exchanges and cooperation in personal information protection and promote mutual recognition of personal information protection rules and standards with other countries, regions, and international organizations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;The cross-border flow of data is considered a basic prerequisite for digital trade. What is the current practice in this regard in the Shanghai Pilot Free Trade Zone? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Peng Delei:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;The cross-border flow of data in the Shanghai Pilot Free Trade Zone is generally governed by the Data Security Law, National Security Law and Personal Information Protection Law. operating within the framework. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When I communicate with the practical community, I feel that they attach great importance to the construction of a digital trust environment. The digital trust environment includes network security, personal privacy protection, etc. For example, in the process of digital trade, it is necessary to ensure that large-scale data leaks or cyber attacks cannot occur. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Shanghai has made a lot of efforts in developing digital trade. For example, the &quot;Implementation Plan&quot; mentioned that the Lingang New Area will build the country&#39;s first digital trust pilot zone. In addition, in July this year, the Standing Committee of the 16th Shanghai Municipal People&#39;s Congress publicly released the full text of &quot;Shanghai Provisions on Promoting Data Circulation and Transactions in Pudong New Area (Draft)&quot; to solicit opinions from the society. The overall context and value concept of this consultation draft is to strengthen the use of data. In the past, many policies emphasized the protection of data. If data can be fully utilized, it will help promote the development of the data economy. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Business environment assessment indicators benchmark against international standards&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: italics , Italics_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;In the past ten years, the Shanghai Pilot Free Trade Zone has been piloted and has achieved many results. In your opinion, what is the most important outcome? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Pendre: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I think the most important thing is to implement the “pre-establishment national treatment plus negative list management system” for foreign investment. This concept was proposed with a certain background, mainly based on some demands and paradigms put forward by the United States on investment access during the bilateral investment negotiations between China and the United States at that time. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But at first, we didn’t know whether these two systems could be implemented, so we first tried them in the Shanghai Pilot Free Trade Zone. In 2013, the Shanghai Pilot Free Trade Zone piloted the first negative list for foreign investment access. Years of trying have since provided many helpful experiences. Therefore, by the promulgation of the Foreign Investment Law of the People&#39;s Republic of China in 2019, the &quot;pre-establishment national treatment plus negative list management system&quot; was officially written into law. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These two systems have been implemented from pilot to legal form and implemented nationwide, achieving the effect that the experience of the Pilot Free Trade Zone can be replicated and promoted, reflecting the pioneering spirit of the Shanghai Pilot Free Trade Zone. mission to try. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;&quot;Free Trade Pilot Zone Key Work List (2023)&quot; issued by the Ministry of Commerce -2025), specifically requires the Shanghai Pilot Free Trade Zone to strive to create a world-class business environment. What can be done in this regard? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Peng Delei: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Shanghai Pilot Free Trade Zone attaches great importance to the construction of business environment. For example, the Lingang New Area is actively benchmarking against the World Bank&#39;s newly released business environment project concept document in May this year, namely the B-READY project. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As far as I know, Lingang New Area invites accounting firms to conduct business environment assessments every year. Not long ago, my colleagues and I went to Lingang New Area to participate in a seminar on the business environment. We talked about the three chapters of B-READY: dispute resolution, bankruptcy and labor. For example, online arbitration can be used Facilitate and improve the business environment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is worth noting that the new version of the World Bank’s business environment assessment indicators includes content related to digital trade, that is, the digital trade restrictions index. In the future, China may also include restrictions on digital trade as part of its business environment assessment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;2023 is the tenth anniversary of the establishment of the Shanghai Pilot Free Trade Zone. Next The free trade pilot zone promotion strategy will be vigorously implemented. How do you think it should be improved? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Pendre: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;At this stage, my country’s overall goal requirements for the improvement strategy of the free trade pilot zone can be summarized into three aspects. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First, it is necessary to improve the alignment with international high-standard economic and trade rules. Currently, it is mainly based on DEPA and CPTPP; second, it is necessary to improve the level of market access, focusing on increasing investment and service trade.

By 2012, Volvo Construction Equipment signed a memorandum of understanding with the Shanghai Municipal Government to establish its regional headquarters in China. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the office, Zhan Xu, director of Volvo Construction Equipment, recalled to Southern Weekend reporters that for the company at that time, it was like a young man starting to make life plans. He had many ideas, but met a bottleneck. &quot;The place where I live is an electronics factory, can I only be a factory boy and factory girl for the rest of my life?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhan Xu described that the establishment of the Shanghai Pilot Free Trade Zone solved the hesitation of &quot;this young man&quot;, &quot;It tells all companies what Pudong, Shanghai and even China will develop into.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In April 2015, the Shanghai Pilot Free Trade Zone was expanded to include the Lujiazui Financial Area, Jinqiao Development Area, and Zhangjiang High-tech Area, in addition to the four special customs supervision areas including the Waigaoqiao Free Trade Zone. In August 2019, the country&#39;s only new free trade pilot zone was unveiled in the Lingang area of ​​Shanghai. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;September 29, 2023 is the tenth anniversary of the Shanghai Pilot Free Trade Zone. Over the past ten years, the Shanghai Pilot Free Trade Zone has been a pioneer in testing systems and exploring new paths for the country, and has also become an important driving force for Shanghai&#39;s economic development. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the &quot;White Paper on the 10th Anniversary of the Construction of the China (Shanghai) Pilot Free Trade Zone&quot;, as of the end of 2022, Pudong New Area has established a total of 18,691 new foreign-invested projects, with a cumulative registered foreign capital of US$217.274 billion, and a cumulative paid-in foreign capital of US$74.994 One hundred million U.S. dollars. Pudong New Area will achieve a regional GDP of 1.6 trillion yuan in 2022, creating 1/74 of the GDP with an area of ​​1/8000 of the country. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Entering a new stage, the Shanghai Pilot Free Trade Zone is facing new expectations. The report of the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China proposed to &quot;implement the strategy of improving the free trade pilot zone.&quot; At the same time, China is applying to join the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) and the Digital Economy Partnership Agreement (DEPA). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to Xinhua News Agency on September 26, 2023, Xi Jinping, General Secretary of the CPC Central Committee, President of the State, and Chairman of the Central Military Commission, recently issued important instructions on further promoting the construction of the free trade pilot zone. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xi Jinping emphasized that on the new journey, based on a comprehensive summary of ten years of construction experience, we must deeply implement the free trade pilot zone improvement strategy, bravely be a pioneer in forging ahead and overcoming difficulties, and work in a wider field and Carry out deeper exploration and strive to build a higher-level free trade pilot zone. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;“&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Responsive to all requests, no disturbance&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;“If there is no free trade pilot zone Without support, a lot of business may be done overseas. With the establishment of the pilot free trade zone, we have one more way to go. Since the pilot free trade zone wants to engage in innovation, companies will feel that they might as well come to the government to talk.&quot; Zhan Xu said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In July 2018, Volvo Construction Equipment became the first company in the Pilot Free Trade Zone to realize cross-border settlement of offshore trade. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A reporter from Southern Weekend learned from the Jinqiao Management Committee that at that time the customer ordered two sets of engineering equipment produced in South Korea from Volvo Construction Equipment. The transaction and transportation occurred overseas, and the fund settlement (receipt from overseas customers, The two processes of payment to Korean factories) are carried out in the free trade pilot zone. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In his early years, Zhan Xu ran through industrial and commercial windows and dealt with the government for a long time. &quot;In the past, we participated in policy briefings, but now we attend more research meetings. Many ideas for institutional innovation in the free trade pilot zone came from the enterprise side.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He said that in the past, enterprises went to The government mostly consults on policies. Now when companies encounter problems, the government helps bring relevant people over and everyone sits down to discuss solutions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Talking about the changes brought about by the Shanghai Pilot Free Trade Zone, Zhan Xu spoke highly of the reform of the commercial system. &quot;All the approval procedures have been simplified. One trip is required for each matter, and sometimes there is no need to make a trip at all. This not only saves manpower and costs for the company, but also plays a great role in stimulating corporate vitality and improving corporate confidence.&quot;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;According to a press conference held by the Shanghai Municipal Government on September 15, 2023, in the past ten years, the Shanghai Pilot Free Trade Zone has deepened the reform of the commercial system around the entire life cycle of enterprises and innovatively carried out &quot;separation of licenses and licenses&quot; and &quot;post-licensing&quot; Pilot projects such as &quot;license reduction&quot; and &quot;one industry, one license&quot; have issued more than 5,000 comprehensive industry licenses in 31 industries. The average approval time has been reduced by nearly 90%, application materials have been reduced by nearly 70%, and form-filling elements have been reduced by more than 60%. %. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, the Shanghai Pilot Free Trade Zone has also taken the lead in implementing the registered capital subscription system, the business entity registration confirmation system, the market quasi-operation commitment immediate entry system, innovating business entity exit mechanisms such as simple cancellation, and continuously reducing institutional transaction cost. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“We respond to requests and don’t disturb anything.” Wu Haixia, CEO of Xingbei Group, expressed similar feelings to Zhan Xu when recalling the company’s process of building Shanghai Free Trade No. 1 Life Technology Industrial Park. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wu Haixia told Southern Weekend reporters that when the Shanghai Pilot Free Trade Zone was officially launched, the company had just arrived at the Waigaoqiao Free Trade Zone to acquire the land. As the first biomedical entrepreneurial park in the Waigaoqiao Free Trade Zone, we will encounter many new situations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Free Trade No. 1 currently plans to build three phases of the park. About 150 companies have settled in the first and second phases of the park. Wu Haixia said that biopharmaceutical companies have different building height requirements from other companies. With the help of the management committee, the maximum floor height of the first-phase park was only 24 meters, and by the third-phase park, it can reach 50 meters. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, at that time, the Shanghai Pilot Free Trade Zone implemented a comprehensive land use reform pilot in the Waigaoqiao Free Trade Zone. This reform is also very attractive to the biomedical industry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Several Opinions on Comprehensive Land Use Planning and Land Management in the Bonded Area of ​​the China (Shanghai) Pilot Free Trade Zone&quot; that came into effect on November 20, 2016 (valid until November 19, 2021), encourages The land uses are compatible, and the land use types are mixed with two or more uses. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Several Opinions&quot; stated that factors such as spatial layout, industrial integration, building compatibility and traffic environment should be comprehensively considered, and functional guidance requirements for comprehensive land use in the bonded area of ​​the free trade pilot zone should be put forward, and the planning of mixed comprehensive land use should be clarified Type of use, proportion, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;The land used by biopharmaceutical companies is generally based on the ratio of 1/3 office, 1/3 R&amp;D, and 1/3 production. But strictly speaking, office and R&amp;D cannot be located on industrial land. .With comprehensive land use reform, it can better meet the needs of the biomedical industry.&quot; Wu Haixia said. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;System innovation can reduce costs for enterprises&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Zhan Xu has been in foreign-funded enterprises for 27 years. In his view, whether a multinational company chooses to stay in one place for development depends on whether it can do more business and whether the market is good; second, whether there are risks in operation and whether the rules are clear; third, whether there is any institutional innovation. , which is an important factor in promoting high-quality development of enterprises. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporters learned from the above-mentioned press conference that of the 302 free trade pilot zone system innovations replicated and promoted at the national level, nearly half were originated from Shanghai or were simultaneously piloted. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Shanghai Hongming Supply Chain Co., Ltd. is an enterprise established nearly 30 years ago. Since 2006, it has gradually transformed from a traditional logistics enterprise into a digital supply chain enterprise, currently mainly engaged in integrated circuits, medical equipment and other industries. Provide supply chain services. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When you walk into Hongming&#39;s office at No. 899 Dangui Road, Pudong New Area, you can see two rows of unmanned workstations. Intelligent robots are completing actions such as identifying and entering waybills and automatically filing customs declarations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the adjacent office, Bai Li, senior manager of Hongming Customs Management Department, told Southern Weekend reporters that the company&#39;s transformation has benefited from many innovative measures in the customs supervision system. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Baili gave an example. A domestic factory purchased a piece of equipment from abroad. When a screen of the piece of equipment failed, the past practice was for the factory to place an order overseas and go through customs clearance, tax payment, and international transportation. Waiting for the process, it may take a week for the new screen to arrive at the factory. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;In a mature manufacturing process, the assembly line machines are lined up one after another. If this one breaks, all the others behind it will be broken.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Started in 2006 , Hongming has opened bonded warehouses in areas such as Waigaoqiao, which is equivalent to putting this screen at the &quot;doorstep&quot;, saving the time and cost incurred by the original &quot;ordering from overseas&quot; model. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But as the size of transactions increases, companies need a more cost-effective approach. &quot;In order to serve factories in ten places across the country, a company needs to put 10 screens, which incurs the cost of 10 screens. So, can it only put 5 screens?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Shanghai Pilot Free Trade Zone Launched The special customs supervision model for the circulation of bonded goods between regions has solved the most troublesome problem of the national circulation of bonded goods in the industrial supply chain. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Now bonded goods between free trade pilot zones can flow quickly and freely, and the data and information flow sent by enterprises are sent to the regulatory authorities, replacing the traditional paper documents between the regulatory authorities of the two places. Circulation.&quot; Bai Li said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hongming has established 24 industrial supply chain logistics centers in 14 cities across the country. This model now covers all its logistics centers, effectively reducing inventory costs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The above-mentioned press conference introduced that the institutional innovation achievements of the Shanghai Pilot Free Trade Zone and the Lingang New Area are mainly reflected in four aspects: focusing on the supply of innovative institutions required for industrial development and enhancing new driving forces for high-quality development. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, in the biopharmaceutical industry, the Shanghai Pilot Free Trade Zone took the lead in piloting the medical device marketing authorization holder system (MAH) in December 2017. Eligible medical device registration applications in the Pilot Free Trade Zone People can apply for a medical device registration certificate individually and then entrust production to an enterprise with qualifications and production capabilities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Free Trade No. 1 is the first biopharmaceutical business park in China that meets MAH requirements. Wu Haixia said that Free Trade One has built the country&#39;s first CDMO platform with industrial park attributes and built 6 production lines. The CDMO platform can provide enterprises with services in research and development, small trials, pilot trials, animal experiments, human trials, registration and approval and other processes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wu Haixia said that generally speaking, the investment in a production line is more than 10 million yuan. In the past, companies had to wait about 2 years from application to finally getting the certificate, during which the production lines were idle. The economic investment of the enterprise has not been maximized and time has been wasted. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He introduced that under the MAH system, companies can share production lines, &quot;which can reduce costs, improve utilization, and release huge dividends.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;July 5, 2018, Shanghai The Food and Drug Administration issued an announcement &quot;Expanding the pilot reform of the city&#39;s medical device registrant system to the entire city.&quot; Starting from June 1, 2021, the revised &quot;Regulations on the Supervision and Administration of Medical Devices&quot; will be officially implemented, and the medical device registrant system will be fully implemented across the country. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wu Haixia also suggested that the whitelist system for biomedical research and development supplies and special imported items should be further promoted and improved. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He said that as &quot;raw materials&quot; for biomedical research and development, special items such as microorganisms, human tissues, biological products, blood and their products have been planned to be imported in recent years with the development of the industry. However, special items may carry risks of various infectious diseases, and Shanghai Port is extremely cautious about related imports and exports. The rapid development of the biomedical industry has put forward higher demands for rapid customs clearance of special items. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Relevant systems will be gradually implemented in Shanghai starting from 2020, but there are still few open parts. It is hoped that the free trade zone can accelerate the implementation of this system. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Make full use of the legislative power of Pudong New Area&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Compared with other free trade pilot zones, the Shanghai Pilot Free Trade Zone was established the earliest, and Pudong The new district has the unique advantage of “legislative power”. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On June 10, 2021, the 29th meeting of the Standing Committee of the 13th National People&#39;s Congress voted and adopted the &quot;Decision on Authorizing the Shanghai Municipal People&#39;s Congress and its Standing Committee to formulate regulations for the Pudong New Area&quot;. Authorize the Shanghai Municipal People&#39;s Congress and its Standing Committee to formulate Pudong New Area regulations based on the practical needs of Pudong&#39;s reform and innovation, in compliance with the provisions of the Constitution and basic legal and administrative rules, and implement them in Pudong New Area. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This unique advantage played an important role when Hongming participated in an institutional innovation in the Shanghai Pilot Free Trade Zone. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2019, Hongming and the Pudong Integrated Circuit Industry Association reported that the company&#39;s application for exemption from compulsory product certification (i.e. &quot;CCC exemption&quot;) took a long time, resulting in the failure of equipment parts to be delivered to semiconductors in time. Problems with the production plant. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The problem Hongming encountered at that time was that the normal CCC exemption required about 2 working days to be issued, but the supply chain after-sales maintenance service needed to be provided 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. The support of the original policy was not enough It can no longer meet industrial needs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Bai Li raised a pen and made several gestures on the table. &quot;For example, a fuse is very small, but once it blows, the entire machine stops.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, traditional CCC exemptions are for upstream and downstream enterprises in the industry, and the supply chain companies themselves do not have development applications. permissions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Baili believes that supply chain companies as chain owners are not only familiar with goods and products, but also have the clearest understanding of the flow of the entire supply chain. If the main unit of the innovation chain can apply, the supervision will be upgraded from point supervision to chain supervision, and the entire flow of goods will be clearly visible where it comes from and where it goes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;With the promotion of Pudong Market Supervision and Administration Bureau, Hongming took the lead in piloting the convenient channel for CCC exemption. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The main contents of the pilot include allowing rapid certification through &quot;self-declaration, automatic certification, and integrity supervision&quot;; through process reengineering, the 5-working-day manual approval will be transformed into a &quot;zero-wait&quot; automatic system Release. At the same time, the restriction that logistics trading enterprises cannot be the subject of CCC exemption applications has been broken, expanding the scope of CCC exemption subjects. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From 2020 to 2022, Hongming and regulatory authorities will continue to improve processes and systems. &quot;By 2023, companies and associations feel that they can combine the legislative power of Pudong New Area to fix the pilot policies and promote them.&quot; Bai Li said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On July 1, 2023, the country&#39;s first CCC exemption management measure &quot;Several Provisions on Exemption from Compulsory Product Certification in Pudong New Area, Shanghai&quot; was officially implemented. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Pudong Market Supervision Bureau described that one of the main innovations in the management measures is that according to relevant regulations, logistics trading companies cannot be the applicant for CCC exemption. With the approval and authorization from the General Administration of Pudong, supply chain enterprises that clearly provide services to key industries can be applicants for CCC exemption. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the fourth meeting of the Standing Committee of the 16th Shanghai Municipal People’s Congress held on July 24, 2023, the Municipal Development and Reform Commission mentioned that it would take the opportunity to make full use of the Pudong New Area’s legislative power to base itself on its own Based on the practical needs of reform and innovation in the Pilot Trade Zone and Lingang New Area, we will study and formulate a number of policies and measures in terms of strengthening the innovation engine, high-level institutional opening, reform system integration, and urban governance modernization. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Innovative intellectual property protection&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Promoting institutional innovation in the field of intellectual property is also the first step for the Shanghai Pilot Free Trade Zone to align with international high-standard economic and trade rules such as CPTPP and DEPA. important aspects. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the 10th anniversary press conference of the Shanghai Pilot Free Trade Zone held by the Shanghai Municipal Government on September 15, Shen Weihua, deputy director of the Municipal Commerce Commission, said that the Shanghai Pilot Free Trade Zone is under the guidance of the Ministry of Commerce and other national ministries and commissions. and support, focus on the provisions of post-border management systems such as trade in goods, trade in services, digital trade, intellectual property rights, and government procurement in CPTPP and DEPA, and study reform measures. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yang Chao, Executive Deputy Director of Pudong New Area, introduced at the press conference that in the 10 years since the construction of the Shanghai Pilot Free Trade Zone, a high-level intellectual property protection system has been improved, including the implementation of rapid patent pre-examination, patent implementation investigation, etc. &quot; &quot;Quick Protection&quot; system, shortening the invention patent authorization cycle from 3 years to 3 months, exploring the implementation of a punitive compensation system for intellectual property infringement, and taking the lead in building an international intellectual property protection highland. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the end of 2021, the Shanghai Lingang New Area Intellectual Property Rights Protection Mutual Aid Fund was launched. This is the country’s first market-oriented intellectual property rights protection mutual aid fund. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Subsequently, the Lingang Market Supervision Bureau took the lead in establishing the non-profit social organization &quot;Lingang New Area Intellectual Property Exchange Promotion Center&quot; and used the center as a platform to operate funds. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Feng Zhenhua, director of the Lingang New Area Intellectual Property Exchange and Promotion Center, told Southern Weekend reporters that the fund was launched in the Lingang New Area mainly because the new area has institutional innovation soil, coupled with the agglomeration of cutting-edge technologies and key industries. There is a need for intellectual property protection. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He pointed out that with the deepening of the participation of enterprises in the new area in international economic and trade, the international competition for intellectual property rights they face has become increasingly fierce. Many enterprises are struggling in international competition due to their weak foundation in talents, funds, information, etc. are often at a disadvantage. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“In this context, the implementation of the fund has improved the diversified intellectual property rights protection system in the Lingang New Area, and will help form a long-term market-oriented operation rights protection and mutual assistance mechanism in the Lingang New Area, providing industry Innovation and development will be escorted.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Currently, there are nearly 180 members of the fund, covering key industrial areas in the Lingang New Area, with a capital scale of nearly 1.3 million. A fund expansion plan was launched in 2022 and will be managed in accordance with the annual fee management regulations of the Board of Directors. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The center introduced that the so-called marketization means that under the guidance of the government, enterprises insist on &quot;self-organization, independent management, and autonomous operation.&quot; Fund raising, management, and use are all solved through market-oriented mechanisms. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As the first of its kind in the country, the fund has no mature experience to draw from. Feng Zhenhua said that this cycle of encountering problems, investigating and researching, and solving problems has been accompanying the entire process of fund establishment and operation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“The real needs of enterprises in the Lingang New Area have become the most important criterion for the establishment of the fund.” The center said that after intensive research on nearly 50 enterprises, the preparatory team determined the conditions for the establishment and operation of the fund. The basic idea is to &quot;combine public welfare with marketization, link intellectual property rights with key industries, and balance system construction with dispute response.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since its establishment, the fund has helped enterprises in Lingang New Area successfully deal with intellectual property disputes and provided financial support for rights protection in 2 cases, and intervened in intellectual property disputes in advance to provide consultation more than 15 times. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A company engaged in the R&amp;D and production of innovative medical devices in Lingang New Area encountered a patent attack from global medical device industry giants during its listing process. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The center introduced that in addition to the active response of enterprises themselves, the fund has played an important role in rights protection assistance, coordinating multi-party expert think tank resources to provide dispute response guidance, providing rights protection financial support, and also providing companies with intellectual property rights. Consulting to help it further improve its intellectual property layout, reduce business risks, and ultimately win the patent invalidation case. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Feng Zhenhua’s view, the free trade pilot zone can also pay attention to the following issues in terms of intellectual property rights in the future. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The first is to let enterprises understand international economic and trade rules and prepare in advance to deal with potential intellectual property risks; the second is to actively integrate into the international high-standard economic and trade rules system, and even influence economic and trade rules through trial and exploratory experience. ; The third is to balance the relationship between China&#39;s technological innovation and industrial development and the application of intellectual property-related provisions in international rules; the fourth is to pay attention to the challenges that new technologies and new business formats bring to the application of intellectual property-related rules. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;“&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Boldly try, boldly break out, and make independent changes&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;September 18, 2023 On the same day, Southern Weekend reporters saw a large green remanufactured engine in the warehouse of Volvo Construction Equipment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The staff present said that this engine is the country&#39;s first &quot;pilot import of remanufactured products in key industries&quot; goods. It was ordered by the company from Sweden and arrived at the warehouse on September 1st. It will be delivered to customers later. For after-sales use. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the &quot;Pudong Release&quot;, in order to allow goods to reach the factory quickly, Pudong Customs provides door-to-door inspection services. The on-site inspection is mainly to ensure that the single goods are consistent, and whether the relevant parameters and performance of the imported machinery and equipment are consistent with the declared contents, so as to ensure that the goods can be transported quickly, smoothly and managed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Prior to this, China managed imported remanufactured products as old mechanical and electrical products at the policy level. &quot;If a Party adopts or maintains measures to prohibit or restrict the import of used goods, the Party shall not apply these measures to remanufactured goods.&quot; Zhan Xu read a section of the CPTPP on remanufactured products. He said that according to international rules, remanufactured products are allowed to be imported. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On June 1, the State Council issued &quot;Several Measures on Piloting Conditional Free Trade Pilot Zones and Free Trade Ports to Align with International High Standards and Promote Institutional Opening&quot;. The first article is to &quot;support pilot areas Carry out pilot projects for the import of remanufactured products in key industries.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Zhan Xu’s view, this institutional innovation for remanufactured products has produced win-win results. Enterprises have broadened their business space, and the free trade zone has increased trade types while integrating with international high-standard rules. In addition, it is also of great significance to opening up domestic and international dual cycles and achieving low-carbon emission reduction goals. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the &quot;Pudong Release&quot;, in order to ensure the smooth customs clearance of the first pilot imported goods, Shanghai Customs intervened in advance, participated in the entire process, and researched and formulated a special supervision plan and emergency plan. Pudong Customs, where the enterprise is located, is responsible for contacting the enterprise, providing advance guidance to the enterprise, customs clearance supervision of remanufactured products, etc., and ensuring efficient import of remanufactured products in key industries through dedicated windows for accepting declarations, &quot;door-to-door&quot; inspections and other service measures. , safe customs clearance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;Why is it called system innovation? Because this change is not about the leader approving a note, but about explaining the reasons and asking everyone to sit down and study.&quot; Zhan Xu said, which departments and respective departments are involved in changing this rule? Issues such as what changes need to be made and how supervision and promotion will be handled after the rule changes must be clearly studied. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past ten years, Zhan Xu’s understanding of free trade zones has also changed. He initially thought that the pilot free trade zone was to introduce policies such as tax incentives in Shanghai. After a while, he began to understand that the establishment of a free trade pilot zone was not to specialize in one place, but to conduct pilot projects to target some special issues and then roll them out across the board. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“In fact, I didn’t expect such a grand level. In the past, I thought that the free trade pilot zone was solving the problem of attracting investment?
