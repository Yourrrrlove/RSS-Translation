Surrounded by the Nan River, the Lopburi River and the Pasak Canal, it forms a unique island city. There are waterways leading to the Gulf of Siam in the south, which can connect China and Southeast Asian countries. It also tightly controls the sea gateway of Sukhothai in the north, becoming a gateway for China, India, and The geographical connection point between Europe and the United States also gave it unique conditions in trade, military, and diplomacy: from the 14th to the 18th century, its developed water and land transportation and dazzling Buddhist architecture made its reputation famous in Southeast Asia and even the entire Asia, and was even regarded as Southeast Asia. The largest and most beautiful city. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/07/02/t0o7trafKMIk2PsnCo9PrdxkPIBcspxi8gj5WHEH.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1280&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/07/02/t0o7trafKMIk2PsnCo9PrdxkPIBcspxi8gj5WHEH.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;199733&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Buddha statues and relics at Wat Mahathat&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Zhang Yameng/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In 1350, the leader of the Luo Zhen (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;now Lopburi&lt;/span>;) regime on the west bank of the Chao Phraya River was Ramathetbodhi (&lt;span style=&quot;font -family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Ramathibodi I, King Uthong&lt;/span>;) defeated Thailand&#39;s first feudal dynasty, the Sukhothai dynasty, and Luo Zhen merged with Siam, the Supan regime on the east bank of the river, to establish A The Yudaya Dynasty is called &quot;Siam&quot; in Chinese historical records. When Bangkok was still a little-known fishing village, the capital of the Ayutthaya Dynasty was already a prosperous &quot;big city&quot; - Chinese people in Thailand thought this city was the largest, so it was called &quot;Ayutthaya&quot;, and even the dynasty was also called &quot;Ayutthaya Dynasty&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In historical documents, Ayutthaya is called &quot;Paradise&quot;. At its peak, the population was about 1 million. Three royal palaces, more than 2,000 gilded minaret temples and more than 4,000 gilded Buddha statues made this place full of charm. The dynasty, which lasted 33 kings and lasted for 417 years, brought Buddhist culture to its peak. In the middle and late period of the Ayutthaya Dynasty, Zhang Xie of the Ming Dynasty also wrote in his &quot;Siam Articles&quot; in &quot;The Examination of Eastern and Western Oceans&quot;: &quot;The soil is wet underneath, the climate is hot and humid, and the people live in high-rise buildings. The rattan system is very strong, with rattan mats and bamboo mats for sleeping in the middle. The palace is more than nine feet high, decorated with gold and carved with eight trigrams, which is extremely magnificent.&quot; Beginning in the 16th century, Ayutthaya&#39;s reputation spread far and wide to Europe, in 1512 The Portuguese first arrived here in 1988, and Ayutthaya gradually became a trade center in the 17th century, with envoys from various European countries arriving in droves. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If the main color of Ayutthaya a few hundred years ago was gold, now here, to be more arbitrary, the city center only has two colors: reddish brown and burnt black: reddish brown is the dusty bricks of the building. Scorched by the scorching sun and eroded by wind and rain, the uneven floors and walls turned into a dark red ocean. Many ancient temples in Ayutthaya appear to be replicas of Angkor Wat at first glance, but after careful inspection, you will find that unlike Angkor temples, which are mostly made of large stones, red bricks are mostly used here; there are no carved walls, There are thousands of corridors here, but many unique architectural styles of the Ayutthaya Dynasty are derived here. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wat Lokaya Sutha (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Wat Lokaya Sutha&lt;/span>;) can no longer be called a &quot;temple&quot;. In a piece of overgrown grass, a huge reclining Buddha is exposed in nature to accept worship; the Wat Phra Si San Phet built in 1491 (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Wat Phra Si San Phet (Temple of the Three Kings) The three remaining white Ceylon-style pagodas are lined up in a row and have become landmarks in Ayutthaya: In 1492, in order to enshrine the ashes of his father and brother, Rama Tepbodhi II built two pagodas in the temple. The pagoda started Thailand&#39;s funeral custom of using pagodas to store the king&#39;s ashes. In 1529, when Ramathebodhi II died, his son built another pagoda. Today, time has not completely destroyed them. Although the many small towers built by successive kings nearby are seriously damaged, they are still majestic and towering, like solemn guards. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To the east of Wat Pasi Sangbi is the Rajapurana Temple (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: italics, italics_GB2312) which is famous for the magnificent pagoda in the main courtyard. , STKaiti;&quot;>;Wat Ratchaburana&lt;/span>;). This Khmer-style pagoda was originally Thai-style. It was built by the ninth king to hold the cremation for his two brothers who died in a duel for succession to the throne: in 1424, King Indraja died, and the two brothers fought each other on elephants. After the death of the first prince, the third son inherited the throne from Phitsanulok and became Borommarachathirat II (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Borommarachathirat II&lt;/span>;). This temple houses the ashes of my brother. After passing through the gate with only one wall left like Ruins of St. Paul&#39;s, you are surrounded by fragmented Buddha statues and walls, as if you suddenly fell into the distant ancient times. On the main tower, which looks like a stick of corn, there are layers of corrugated tower decorations; surrounded by four small Ceylon-style towers, it is the most complete Khmer-style pagoda in the city. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The oldest temple in the city is in the southeast corner outside the moat, Wat Yai Chaiyamongkho (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Wat Yai Chaiyamongkho&lt;/span >;) Built in 1357 by King Utong to commemorate the birth of the dynasty. Different from the ruined temples in the city that are full of vicissitudes of life, traces of reconstruction can be seen everywhere here, but they do not make people feel obtrusive. They are not even as good as the yellow silk draped in the pagoda. The visual contrast with the mottled red bricks is strong. The 28-meter-long white reclining Buddha is the symbol here. Wearing a yellow cassock, he lies peacefully on his side under the hot white sun, looking indifferently at the weather-beaten land and rivers around him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Climb up to the Ceylon-style main tower. There are eight Buddha statues inside. What is even more unforgettable is that a strange mixed smell permeates it. The smell of gunpowder smoke is mixed with the smell of decaying plants, and more of the human body stench. , making it difficult to breathe. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/07/02/O8ZavUlGZts4QzA5JEiQYYEJ6WNcHmgpnydEoF4Q.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1280&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/07/02/O8ZavUlGZts4QzA5JEiQYYEJ6WNcHmgpnydEoF4Q.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;199731&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Chaiwatthanaram Temple, the back of the Buddha statue&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Zhang Yameng/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt; h4>;The dark reflection of prosperity&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;When the tourists disappeared, only a piece of tranquility washed over the years remained around the reclining Buddha in Yacha Mengkong Temple - around the main tower, many headless Buddha statues stood silently , seeming not to want to tell the story of their experiences. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The name of Ayutthaya comes from the birthplace of Rama in the Indian epic &quot;Ramayana&quot; and the place where Rama ascended the throne after his triumphant return (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family : Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Ayodhya&lt;/span>;), Sanskrit means &quot;the invincible city&quot; or &quot;the city of eternal victory&quot;, but this name is just like the prophecy: as the second largest city after the Khmer Empire A &quot;superpower&quot; in Southeast Asia, when the Ayutthaya Dynasty reached its peak, the war between it and Myanmar also continued. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;All glory must come to an end. In 1766, King Meng Bo of Myanmar, who had coveted Ayutthaya for a long time, led his army to siege the city for 14 months. After 14 months of siege, he blew down the city wall and entered the city. After 15 days of burning, killing and looting, 30,000 people were taken prisoner and Ayutthaya was almost razed to the ground. Flat ground. The invincible city was destroyed in the war - the longest dynasty in the history of the Kingdom of Thailand, with all its splendor, came to an abrupt end in 1767, leaving only a dozen temples that had been &quot;washed away from the glory&quot;. ——There are many black fire stains on the red bricks, and the Buddha statues were also blackened by the flames. They stood silently in the city, testifying to the golden age of the Ayutthaya Dynasty. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Ayutthaya, the opposite of red is black. South of the Rajapurana Temple, Wat Mahathat (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 毷体, 毷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Wat Mahathat&lt;/span>;) is said to be the primary target of the Burmese army&#39;s attack on Thailand: This monastery was built in 1374 during the reign of King Borommarachathirat I (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Borommarachathirat I&lt;/span>;) and had 10 In the remaining monasteries, there are more than 200 pagodas like a jungle. Now only the huge square pagoda base is left in the middle of the temple, and many of the smaller pagodas are seriously tilted and crumbling. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/07/02/6195U6sn6f8c0tGvvLkiR9ucZIqb3IjpSLOsZU80.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1280&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/07/02/6195U6sn6f8c0tGvvLkiR9ucZIqb3IjpSLOsZU80.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;199735&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Rows of headless Buddha statues at Chaiwatthanaram Temple&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Zhang Yameng/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p >; &lt;p>;In Ayutthaya temples, many of the Buddha statues &quot;sitting in rows&quot; have no heads. A pair of stone Buddha feet or a huge Buddha hand will be &quot;surprised&quot; in the corner on the ground. The look is very &quot;post-modern&quot; &quot;. Perhaps for this reason, many tourists like to bend their knees and hide behind the Buddha statue, and stick their heads out from the broken neck of the Buddha statue to take pictures. In fact, the Buddha statues and pagodas in Wat Mahathat were plated with gold or contained gold leaves, which led the Burmese army to behead the Buddha statues or burn them in fires, causing the gold to separate from the stone, causing expansion and contraction of the Buddha statues&#39; heads. , hands and feet were broken, leaving the remains of limbs and arms devastated. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ayutthaya is like the Old Summer Palace. The sunlight paints the high tower of Wat Chaiwatthanaram (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 毷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Wat Chaiwatthanaram&lt;/span>;) in golden color, giving the red bricks a fierce beauty. , taking people back to the war-torn era. When the red has turned to black, the pagoda stands alone. The mottled pagodas, broken brick walls, dark Buddha statues, and vast monuments ruthlessly cover up the prosperity and destruction. Only the remaining documents and oral stories are passed down from generation to generation, and the years are like a passing cloud - -The prosperity of the prosperous times will also become the reflection of disillusionment, just like the long-lasting lonely back of the Buddha statue sitting high on the almost collapsed base in Chaiwatthanaram Temple in the sunset. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When the army invaded, the Buddhist temples were completely destroyed. Wherever the knife fell, as the writer Ondajie said, &quot;the towering Buddha image with profound meaning fell to the ground and fell into the soil.&quot; Over a long period of time, a Buddha&#39;s head was tightly wrapped by the thousand-year-old Bodhi root, and the surrounding branches and vines entangled it, forming the wonder of a tree wrapping the Buddha&#39;s head. It is also the most famous &quot;eternal smile&quot; of Wat Mahathat. . Just like the &quot;endgame&quot; of the view of Ta Prohm Temple in Angkor Wat, the strangulation phenomenon of trees in Southeast Asia will eventually cause plants to replace their hosts. However, the Buddha statue is still smiling in the Bodhi tree with his eyes closed and saying nothing, as if he has watched the changes in the dynasty. , it is a kind of magical demeanor that is with everything and transcends life and death, allowing people to stand in front of it and stare at it for a long time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/07/02/lmZSQApUZC6H2cHR93AVBJ73b6xdvLXGmP79YlDz.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;1280&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/07/02/lmZSQApUZC6H2cHR93AVBJ73b6xdvLXGmP79YlDz.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;199732&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The wonder of the Buddha head wrapped in a tree at the Mahathat Temple&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Zhang Yameng/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt; p>;Thousands of people spent time building the Ayutthaya City, and the Ayutthaya City watched the world created by these thousands of people in the light and shadow. After the fall of the Ayutthaya dynasty, Taksin moved the Thai capital nearly 100 kilometers south to Thonburi. After only 15 years of the Thonburi dynasty, the Bangkok dynasty established its capital in Bangkok in 1782, writing prosperity on the new land, and Ayutthaya was Fading out of people&#39;s sight. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;More than two hundred years have passed by, and now it is more like a small town full of rural atmosphere and leisure atmosphere. In the ruins park, lawns, green trees, and ponds create an idyllic scene; locals will spread out mats for picnics, or rent traditional costumes to imitate the popular TV series &quot;A Match Made in Heaven&quot; that was filmed here, and take photos in the ruins. The red and black ruins are close to the newly built houses and temples. The fireworks and water blend among the ruined bricks and stones, giving a sense of astonishment as if you have traveled through time and space. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/07/02/x7hi1VxguExowXr794aIulu9kB1uHbU8QeHdUO1p.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1280&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/07/02/x7hi1VxguExowXr794aIulu9kB1uHbU8QeHdUO1p.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;199734&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Elephant on the lawn of Bangbain Summer Palace&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Zhang Yameng/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p >;Between Ayutthaya and Bangkok, Bang Pa-In Summer Palace was built in the 17th century (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Bang Pa-In Summer Palace&lt;/span>; ) is the largest and most beautiful royal palace in Thailand.

In many cases, it can reflect the history and present of a society. , China and foreign countries are no exception. Everyone who has traveled to Europe will have experienced the toilet dilemma. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are generally very few public toilets in European countries, and it is often only possible to find one within a few kilometers, so there are apps for finding toilets in Europe. In contrast, in China, the function of finding toilets is covered by map apps. It is not a popular feature and cannot support an APP alone. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to being cheap, toilets in Europe also charge a fee. In many European countries, such as the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Germany and other places, you have to pay to use public toilets. For example, most of the toilets in high-speed service areas or shopping malls in Germany have to pay. Even the toilets in fast food restaurants, shopping malls, train stations, McDonald&#39;s, and KFC are charged. For example, in Cologne, Germany, there is a fee for using the toilets inside McDonald&#39;s. For another example, a KFC in Poland posted a notice: The restrooms in the store are only available to customers. People without consumption receipts need to pay 30 zloty (approximately 53 yuan) if they want to use the restroom. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are also various forms of charging. There is a person sitting at the door to collect the fee, there is a gate that rotates after a coin is inserted, and some are trustworthy and put a tip tray. In some stores, the toilet door has a password, and the password is printed on the shopping receipt. Not every floor of German department stores has restrooms. They are usually located near the restaurant floor on the top floor. Using the restrooms is generally free, but if there are cleaners there, a tip of about 0.3 euros is usually required. If you are in a tourist area, we will also thoughtfully provide exchange rate conversion, and the prices in each country&#39;s currency are clearly marked. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The charges for European toilets are not cheap. The last trip to the toilet costs as little as 0.3 Euros and as much as 2 Euros. 1 euro is equivalent to 7.7 yuan, which is equivalent to between 2 yuan and 15 yuan. Even if the income is higher, going to the toilet in Europe is really not cheap. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As one of the richest regions in the world, Europe is also a region with the most complete &quot;social welfare&quot;. Why are there so few free public toilets? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First of all, it’s because of history. In many European cities, such as London, England, Stockholm, Sweden, and Paris, France, there are semi-open open-air toilets on the streets. It wraps the lower body but can only be used by men. These open-air urinals are used very frequently in the local area. This strange street urinal has been around in Europe for nearly 200 years. This also reflects the historical origin of the lack of public toilets in Europe. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As a result of this historical path, people may not regard public toilets as a government obligation. In fact, public toilets in many places in Europe are basically privatized. In this case, solve the problem according to market thinking. Toilets require regular maintenance and repairs, and you also need to hire someone to clean them. Most European countries are developed countries, and labor costs are high. This has resulted in high maintenance costs for toilets. Businesses are unwilling to include it in a package of services, but charge separately. supply. Private toilets in European cafes, small bars and other commercial places assume some functions of public toilets. Of course, you must consume food first and then use the toilet. Europeans are also accustomed to paying to use public toilets, or go to a coffee shop to buy a cup of coffee to solve their internal problems. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The situation in European countries is not exactly the same. In Denmark, which has high taxes and high welfare, the government believes that the freedom to use public toilets is a public service that the government must meet. Therefore, in the urban area of ​​Copenhagen, the capital city with a small population, there are sufficient public toilets, good environment, and they are free. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, Chinese toilets also used to charge fees. From the late 1970s to the late 1980s, as the economy developed, cities in China began to build higher-grade public toilets one after another, implementing water flushing and mechanical pumping. As the level of public toilets has improved, the cost has also increased. Some cities have begun to charge for public toilets to alleviate the shortage of funds for public toilet construction and management. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the end of the 20th century, with the further development of the economy, Chinese people began to have higher requirements for toilets. New residential areas were built, and toilets were increased from one to two bathrooms. However, public toilets are not free so early. In mid-tier cities like Qingdao, public toilets were not open for free until May 1, 2008, which is only 15 years ago. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Free public toilets, after all, the government has money. After years of accumulation of reform and opening up, especially after joining the WTO, the economy has developed rapidly, real estate has taken off, and local governments have obtained sufficient funds from land finance, so they are able to bear the entire cost of public toilets. Therefore, free public toilets in China are mainly the result of economic development. Whether to charge or not is closely related to the economic situation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Toilet charges are essentially a matter of government revenue and the scope of government public services. If the situation of public toilets in Europe is very bad, it is because of historical, cultural and customary reasons. Society has also developed various alternative forms and people have adapted to them. In some countries, the benefit of free public toilets has never appeared, and naturally it is not felt much. But if you return from free to paid again, you will have a different perception. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;

At 19:00 on October 5, Beijing time, the winner was announced, Can Xue lost. But this does not mean that the odds have no reference value. In fact, Norwegian writer Jon Fother ranks second after Can Xue on this odds list. Unlike Gurner, the 2021 winner, Fauser is not an unpopular choice. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the more than 100-year history of the Nobel Prize for Literature, only 17 female writers have won the prize, and 8 of them won the prize in the 21st century, including the American female poet Glück in 2020 and French female writer Ernault in 2022. Undoubtedly, the Swedish Academy, which has been questioned by public opinion, is turning its attention more and more to outstanding female authors. Therefore, Can Xue still has a good chance of winning this award in the future. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The citation for the award was &quot;for his innovative plays and essays that give voice to the ineffable&quot;. Fosse&#39;s award &quot;quite reasonably follows the tradition of the Nobel Prize in Literature not forgetting outstanding playwrights, from Maeterlinck, Shaw, and Beckett to Dario Foe, Pinter, and Handke. It is quite brilliant. Even more convincing than the list of novelists,&quot; poet and critic Liao Weitang told Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Eon Fosse is one of the most famous figures in contemporary theater and a popular candidate for the Nobel Prize in recent years. His works also cover poetry, novels, essays, children&#39;s literature and translations. Fother&#39;s plays have been staged thousands of times around the world, including &quot;The Girl on the Sofa&quot; in China in 2004 and &quot;One Summer&quot; produced by the Shanghai Dramatic Art Center. Fosse once watched his own play &quot;Somebody&#39;s Coming&quot; in Shanghai and felt that it was one of the best stage presentations of his work in the world, and he developed a respect for Chinese drama and Chinese culture. Fother&#39;s honors include the Scandinavian National Theater Award (2002), the Norwegian Arts Council Honor Award (2003), the Swedish Academy&#39;s Nordic Prize (2007), and the International Ibsen Prize (2010). ). The work &quot;New Title: Heptata 6-7&quot; was shortlisted for the 2022 International Booker Prize. Anders Olsen, chairman of the Nobel Prize Committee for Literature, said his works &quot;touch upon your deepest feelings, anxieties, insecurities, questions of life and death.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fosse was born in Haugesund on the west coast of Norway on September 29, 1959. He began his creative career at the age of twelve, which he calls &quot;ashamingly early&quot;. Fosse loved to play guitar and at one time was in a rock band. Translator Zou Lulu believes that &quot;his early musical experience brought a unique Fother-like color and style to his later writing - a strong sense of rhythm and musicality in his dramatic language.&quot; Since the late 1970s, Fosse has lived in Bergen, Norway&#39;s second largest city and the country&#39;s cultural capital. In recent years, he has also gone to southern France and Austrian towns on the outskirts of Vienna to write. Fosse is very energetic and often starts writing at four or five o&#39;clock in the afternoon and works until nine o&#39;clock the next morning. When asked if he had any advice for writing, he said: &quot;Write, don&#39;t think! Think before you write, think after you finish, but don&#39;t think about anything while writing.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;About En Fauser&#39;s earliest reading memory is a small book. In the book, a major felt that his town needed a fire truck, and then he and some citizens built it. It looked more like what children built out of wood. Car. “I used wood to build cars when I was a kid,” Fosse said. He admired Trakl, Kafka and Beckett, and at the same time, Beckett was an important object of &quot;resistance&quot; when he wrote dramas. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fosse uses a rare language, &quot;New Norwegian&quot;. Even in Norway, which has a population of only more than five million, its speakers only account for one-tenth of the total population. Fortunately, New Norwegian can be easily understood by Norwegian, Swedish, and Danish speakers. But it is with the help of translation that Fosse&#39;s works are known to more readers. Currently, his books have been translated into more than forty languages. At first, he only wanted to write poems and novels. In 1993, he was invited to write his first script because he was short of money. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Currently, there are John Fother&#39;s drama selections &quot;Somebody&#39;s Coming&quot; and &quot;Autumn Dreams&quot; published by Shanghai Translation Publishing House. Wenjing is about to publish &quot;Trilogy&quot;, one of Fosse&#39;s masterpiece novels. This work won the Nordic Council Literary Award in 2015 and demonstrates his cold, solemn and concise epic style. The novel contains three closely connected parts: &quot;Awakening&quot;, &quot;Olav&#39;s Dream&quot; and &quot;Tiredness&quot;. The story begins with the young lovers Asle and Alida leaving their hometown for Björgven (the city of Bergen). Alida is about to give birth, but the couple has difficulty finding a place to live. They later found a place to live and gave birth to a son, Sigvald, who began to adopt different names, Olav and Åsta. But someone recognized Asler, and it was very clear that Asler and Alida seemed to be carrying murder cases, although Asler might have acted out of helplessness. Asler was eventually hanged. In the last part, the story time advances to the life of Asler and Alida&#39;s daughter Ales. By this time Ales is already an old woman. She recalls her sister who died young and herself. His brother Sigvald left him when he was young...&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Wan, the editor-in-chief of &quot;Trilogy&quot;, is a young writer and translator. In her opinion, John Fother&#39;s After the work was introduced to China, it has not attracted widespread attention from readers, and even senior readers rarely know about him. &quot;Fosse is not an issue-oriented writer. He has very consistently inherited the Nordic expressionist drama tradition. His language is concise and full of tension. His profound depiction of the character&#39;s spirit and his analysis of the relationship between people have reached a very high level. He will not write about trivial daily life, but pay attention to people&#39;s mental state.&quot; Li Wan told Southern Weekend reporters, &quot;The protagonist of Fosse&#39;s work is somewhat similar to himself. He is an alcoholic. He has some mental problems and has many extreme fringe experiences. He faces his own heart very directly and exposes himself. He is a writer who can share with others the most helpless side of a person.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;With this, At the same time, Jon Fother has developed a unique style of writing. Periods are rarely used. A sentence is often very, very long. He uses many commas to connect it, giving people the feeling that the inner monologue is constantly rolling forward. This may not be the case. Due to the sensitivity of a playwright, he brings dramatic elements into the novel. In addition, he will use some repetitive sentences in different parts of the novel, but this repetition is not exactly the same, but changes with the changing context and the change of words. Subtle changes produce variations and variations, bringing a rhythm that is cyclical and constantly advancing,&quot; Li Wan said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 06 Oct 2023 11:55:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[被上司“甩锅”怎么办？当首先秉直做好自己的分内事]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258030]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-06 11:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Complaining about your boss in the workplace is a long-lasting and endless &quot;program&quot;. Regarding the question &quot;What is the most shameless sentence you have ever heard from a manager?&quot;, some netizens&#39; answers resonated: A subordinate proposed a plan, and the leader said it was no good and must be modified according to his wishes. The subordinate insisted, and the leader was angry, &quot;Listen to me. That’s fine.” There was a problem with the implementation of the leader&#39;s revised plan. The leader went to his subordinates and said, &quot;Why didn&#39;t you insist on it in the first place? You should insist on what you think is right. You have to find a way to convince me. You have no opinion at all.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p >;&quot;Why don&#39;t you persuade me properly?&quot; In essence, this sentence represents a kind of shirk of responsibility. Isn&#39;t there a saying, &quot;The merit is for oneself, the fault is for others&quot;, which refers to this kind of person. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This kind of leader is indeed the kind that easily arouses public anger. It is clear that his subordinates have opinions but their opinions are &quot;beaten to death&quot;, and they still say that others have no opinions, which is simply a hooliganism. But it’s not too weird, because he at least hinted that the subordinate’s original plan was correct, and it is extremely difficult for a leader to admit this. Leaders who do things like this are really rare nowadays. Leaders who shirk responsibility will not do it so obviously and without skills, because it is impossible to sit in this position with such a simple and crude IQ. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A situation a little more &quot;shameless&quot; than this was mentioned by a netizen: Under normal circumstances, the leader will tell you that you have messed up such a good plan of mine, how to implement it? of? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This sentence really impressed me. Yes, some leaders have this tone and taste. They are &quot;always reasonable&quot; in front of their subordinates. But this is not the best of &quot;pass-and-pass leadership&quot;. The real best is that he never says what his plan is, he just asks you to implement it, and then keeps making changes. Such leaders are either unpredictable and disdainful of mediocre plans, or they are extremely poor and like to &quot;hide their clumsiness&quot; while using their subordinates as &quot;guinea pigs&quot; for plans. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The latter situation is not uncommon in reality. To put it bluntly, some people get into important management positions without knowing how, and then start a happy life of being guided by laypeople. To be honest, I&#39;m most afraid of this. If a lay leader values ​​your talent and ability and therefore chooses to respect your plan, that&#39;s not bad. The worst thing is that he doesn&#39;t know how to pretend to understand and is stubborn and uses a lot of jokes to explain &quot; Management wisdom&quot; to force subordinates to &quot;obey&quot;. When I was young, I encountered bosses who would always say, &quot;You just need to be obedient.&quot; Ninety-nine percent of those who advocate &quot;obedience and learning&quot; are ambitious and talented bosses who love to pretend. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Relatively speaking, a leader who is &quot;overbearing&quot; but can handle things and take responsibility is much better. Those leaders who want to show leadership authority but have no structure are just &quot;dwarf&quot; leaders. The reason why they dare not take responsibility or take responsibility is because of selfishness and face. They do not have the courage to admit that they are inferior to their subordinates and are jealous of their talents. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is said that management is an art. There is nothing wrong with this, but one thing should be added: management must first be about human touch. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What follows is what should subordinates do in the face of the aforementioned leaders who love to shirk their responsibilities? In other words, where is the boundary of responsibility between superiors and subordinates in the workplace? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In any unit, superiors and subordinates are the &quot;community of goals&quot;. Considering that most units adopt a project responsibility system, superiors and subordinates should be of one mind, be capable, and be wise. Out of wisdom, in short, judging by talent. But in reality, this kind of situation is rare. In many cases, the game and internal friction between superiors and subordinates fill the time and space of a unit, which is suffocating and sighing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this regard, although the &quot;pass-through leader&quot; bears the greatest responsibility, is there no way for subordinates to reflect on it? it&#39;s not true. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In a unit, there are always the most &quot;honest people&quot;. They often just want to do things well and get paid on time. But if everything went so smoothly, there would be no such thing as &quot;workplace troubles.&quot; The biggest confusion a dutiful employee encounters is being blamed by his boss or even making things difficult for him. In this kind of environment, no matter what you do, it won&#39;t be satisfactory. Just looking at the leader&#39;s face every day is enough. In this regard, many people&#39;s bad emotions inevitably accumulate in their hearts, and there seems to be no other way except to find reliable people to complain about from time to time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But it’s useless to complain behind your back. If the leader can’t hear it, won’t it end up being scattered in the wind? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, as a subordinate, after encountering a strange leader, you are not just helpless and let others &quot;abuse&quot; you, but you can deal with it according to the actual situation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For a matter or a plan, if subordinates are not assigned responsibilities and bear the final consequences, it goes without saying that under normal circumstances, just listen to the leader. If you have a responsibility, it is your duty to do it well. If you do not do it well, you will bear the final consequences. Even if the leader puts forward opinions, they can only be used as a reference. If something is wrong, you will not blindly follow it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If the &quot;ultimate person in charge&quot; of this matter is your boss, and you are just an executor, then when you encounter the leader making an obvious mistake, you can do it in two situations. The first is to persuade when necessary, state the interests and harms, and let the leader hear the correct point of view. As for whether the leader adopts it or not, the decision lies with the leader; the second is that if the leader is stubborn, he will not only be unable to listen to different opinions, but will even put forward opinions. If the behavior is not tolerated, then it would be uninteresting to stay in such a department. Instead of being blamed and taking the blame for a long time, it is better to consider changing departments - which is equivalent to changing the leader. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Persuading leaders is indeed risky. In the workplace, there are leaders who like to put small shoes on those who give opinions, but if you are a decent subordinate, why would you dare not to give opinions? Are you just worried about what your boss will think of you? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Years ago, when I was a middle-level cadre in a company, I often gave advice to my superiors, even arguing. Sometimes, my opinions are adopted, for example, to protect employees in my department from being punished indiscriminately; sometimes, my opinions are ignored, such as when the leader handles things unfairly in the elimination of the last place, resulting in people who should not leave. Being &quot;eliminated&quot; but refusing to correct his mistakes. This kind of nest had too much to worry about, and I felt uncomfortable. After careful consideration, I chose to leave. Although I lost some visible &quot;benefits&quot; as a result, I won the respect and understanding of those who knew me. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the final analysis, if a subordinate wants to have a good relationship with his superiors in work and life, and coordinate various affairs well, it is the basic principle to be neither humble nor arrogant, and to stick to the bottom line. Without this principle, the relationship between the two parties will inevitably be distorted. A person with a strong sense of right and wrong cannot really change the adverse effects caused by insisting on the correct position, nor can he be as &quot;well-rounded&quot; as some people, but he should still insist on being an upright and outspoken person. Otherwise, even if we have achieved &quot;maximization of interests&quot;, we have lost our bottom line and character. Can we still have a clear conscience? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 06 Oct 2023 11:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[尹学芸：故乡是一枚爱人丨月是故乡明⑥]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257348]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-06 10:30:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/ 09/04/73f60a5ff76ba4f9050678f79d1cf516.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;1620&quot; data-src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/ image/21/09/04/73f60a5ff76ba4f9050678f79d1cf516.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;159101&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Reading Yin Xueyun&#39;s &quot;The Hermit Seekers Are Not Encountered&quot; for the first time, readers may feel a little confused. His novels always &quot;talk right from the beginning, without any pretense&quot;, like green seedlings growing in the ground, simple and pretty, with a fresh earthy smell. A writer who is used to writing about villages, counties, officialdom, and wine shops, How did you come up with the idea of ​​writing an urban romance novel that looks like flowers in the fog? The 2021 novel collection of the same name includes several novellas such as &quot;The Hermit Seekers Are Not Encountered&quot;, &quot;Wanghu Tower&quot;, &quot;Feeding the Ghosts&quot;, &quot;The Apple Tree&quot; and &quot;Faster Than the Wind&quot;. Continue reading, this &quot;strange&quot; novel The origins of the story are gradually revealed, and a Yin Xueyun familiar to old readers slowly emerges. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The origin of Yin Xueyun’s writing is Jizhou in the northernmost part of Tianjin City&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #888888;&quot;>; (formerly known as Ji County before 2016) &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;. There is an artificial lake in the small town, which was once an important water source for Tianjin. In the past, people often fished, took boats, and swam in the lake, but in order to protect the water source, these projects were canceled and many buildings around the lake were demolished one by one. She walked along the lake when she had nothing to do. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;&quot;The Hermit Seekers Are Not Encountered&quot; tells the story of two women, Xue Xiaoli and Su Mei, and a young man who went to an abandoned manor to search for her in &quot;pairs&quot; several times. The story of a reclusive master. The novel originated from an encounter with Yin Xueyun himself. During a stroll, she walked into an abandoned manor and saw different flowers and plants inside, as well as swings, a sports field, a fish pond, and a lake-view pavilion. The old luxury was clearly visible, and she even saw something familiar to her. man&#39;s inscription. There used to be many well-decorated sanatoriums in the small town. They were built by various departments in places close to mountains and rivers. It was difficult for ordinary people to enter, and they were later demolished. Such a manor could be hidden in the small Jizhou, and even the locals would find it difficult to find it. She guessed that this garden was also one of those sanatoriums. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/09/04/ec25f82eb0ee551da14bf69a97e2a8f0.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;800&quot; data-src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/09/04/ec25f82eb0ee551da14bf69a97e2a8f0.jpeg&quot; data-key= &quot;159102&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;There are only a few scenes in the small town. One scene can be looked back and forth, guessed, and used. This secret manor has been written by Yin Xueyun in &quot;Wanghu Tower&quot; and &quot;Looking for the Lake&quot;. Hidden people are not seen&quot;. When it is prosperous, the garden is the Wanghu Tower where retired workers from the county town spend all their money to treat guests to a meal; when it is desolate, the garden has become an elusive place for veteran cadres who are walking in official steps with their hands behind their backs. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;It seems to be her writing instinct to repeatedly salvage, wash and chew her own life without wasting a grain of inspiration. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/09/04/8ded87050634cf1d3cb1a36b522a0991.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;900&quot; height=&quot;171&quot; data-src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/09/04/8ded87050634cf1d3cb1a36b522a0991.png&quot; data-key= &quot;159097&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;&lt;span>;From Hancun to Xuncheng&lt;/span>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;&lt;span >;Jizhou is the only semi-mountainous area in Tianjin. It is high in the north and low in the south. Mountains, plains, large depressions and reservoir areas gather here. The earliest history can be traced back to the Spring and Autumn Period. There is a poem in the Ming Dynasty that goes: &quot;When you come to the west to reach the end of the mountains, you will see the city of Jizhou.&quot; Life in the mountainous areas rarely changes, and people are not good at adapting. The characters in Yin Xueyun&#39;s works all have a persistent background. Color: Sisters Li Xun and Li Quan who persisted in love and pursued light in the war-torn years in &quot;The Wind and Dust&quot;, Feng Nuo who persisted in searching for her missing friend despite opposition in &quot;The Ballad of Cai Gen&quot;, and firmly believed in the power of the apple tree in &quot;The Apple Tree&quot; Suspicious Liu Ping... Some historians told Yin Xueyun that when the Qing army entered the Pass, the people of Ji County refused to surrender until death, and were massacred three times. The character of the people here was to be cruel, sluggish, and twisted. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Jizhou is a place where obsession arises, and Yin Xueyun’s literature is also the fruit of persistence. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Some people went to visit Yin Xueyun’s village after reading her works, but were disappointed to find that the river was not that clear, the streets were not that long, and there were not always cows braying when entering the village. and fried grasshoppers. Yin Xueyun has actually seen these beauties, but the rare village she writes about is neither a peach blossom garden nor a foreign land where strange legends are born, but a place of life, with all kinds of villagers passing through, providing three meals a day. Running around and calculating, the relationships between people are intricate and intricate. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;To be precise, the village where Yin Xueyun was born and raised is in the lowest depression in southern Jizhou, surrounded by water on three sides, with only one road on the south side. The &quot;Uncle Li Hai&quot; who won her the Lu Xun Literature Prize followed this road every year and came to &quot;my&quot; house empty-handed, bringing the family a glory that only existed in their imagination, and then loaded up with everything they had cobbled together. Food and supplies go back. The friendship that never returned lasted for more than 20 years and finally overdrawn. The family kept a secret about Uncle Li Hai. Only then did &quot;I&quot; know about the humiliating life history of my uncle. He did not live in an urban community with gardens and high-rise buildings, but in a remote place. In the barren Kuli Valley, the family is extremely poor, and several members of the family wait for Uncle Li Hai to bring flour from &quot;my&quot; house every year to make dumplings for the New Year. The two families looked up to each other and secretly compared each other to get through the difficult period. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;When Yin Xueyun was a child, the days in the village moved at an almost solid speed. The only changes were who died and who got married. Some people wear the same clothes in winter and summer, but they take out the cotton wool in summer and stuff it in in winter. The village is nicknamed &quot;Nagging Village&quot; because there are many people who are not doing their job properly and enjoy good food and drink. Meat that cannot be sold in other villages will be sold here. Her parents are both farmers, and there is no one around her who is involved in writing work. She looked for the source of her literary genes, which was her grandfather who could read scripts, sing operas, and shout trumpets. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Many writers remember their reading history. She also wrote down in her notebook: &quot;Wild Fire and Spring Wind Fighting in the Ancient City&quot;, &quot;Fighting Youth&quot;, &quot;Golden Avenue&quot;...from elementary school She had memorized 147 titles of books she read from first grade to junior high school graduation. This number made her wonder if she had remembered it wrong. But in her words, these books are all about war, which may not be very nutritious for literature. When she was a teenager, she didn’t even know there were magazines in the world, let alone come into contact with foreign literature. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Even so, you must read, read one book at a time, and come out bit by bit. Because of scarcity, the memory of books is strong. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;It is not easy for rural children to get access to books, and sometimes they have to &quot;match wits and courage&quot; with their brothers and sisters. When she was a child, her sister, who was seven years older than her, loved reading and would often bring books to the house but would not read them to her. Once my sister hid a book that was said to be &quot;not suitable for children&quot;. She turned the house upside down and finally found it in an old cotton shoe. When she took the book out, she only smelled the smell of feet. When she was not at home, she took it out and read it, stuffed it back after reading it, and secretly finished reading the book about &quot;sexual intercourse&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #888888;&quot;>; (later she found out it was &quot;Song of Youth&quot; 》)&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/09/04/7f8bae790b16dddbf271186d99de917a.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;1080&quot; data-src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/09/04/7f8bae790b16dddbf271186d99de917a.jpeg&quot; data-key= &quot;159107&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;When she was not at school, she was reading a book while herding sheep. There was a lamb beside her and a copy of &quot;A Dream of Red Mansions&quot; without a book cover on her lap. The book was written in traditional Chinese characters. , she couldn’t understand it at all, but she could still remember the plot of “Second Sister You swallowed her own gold and died by herself”, and the stories in the book took root in her mind. On the way to school in the town, she walked in the wheat field with the children in the village. The children rushed to her side. She held a spindle in her hand and spun the cotton randomly pulled from the cotton field into thread, while talking about Mix books and memories with imagination to make a story, and tell it to your friends. She began to dream that one day her writing would be turned into type. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;After graduating from high school, Yin Xueyun went to work as a seamstress in a village-run garment factory. As long as she had a day off, she would go to the county town and buy ten magazines and read them all night long. She also started to contribute articles to publications after work. At the beginning, she didn&#39;t pay attention to the differences between different publications. She couldn&#39;t remember the names of the writers she read, didn&#39;t understand anything, and her manuscripts were rejected many times. Sometimes, the editor criticized her in the rejection letter for imitating a certain writer. She was confused and didn&#39;t know who the writer she was &quot;imitating&quot; was. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;At heart, she is still a farmer who relies on the weather. If it rains too much, the seedlings will grow wildly, and if there is a severe drought, there will be no harvest. The same is true for writing. There is no chance of winning awards or becoming famous. My ambition is to work step by step and write whatever comes to my mind. During this period, she relied on her innate spirituality and affection to write about life in the countryside and the ecology of the countryside, expressing those around her who were &quot;thinking of ways to live&quot;. She published publications ranging from &quot;Jixian Literature and Art&quot; to &quot;Tianjin Literature&quot; &quot;Tianjin Daily&quot;, the efforts are slowly paying off. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In the late 1980s, Yin Xueyun’s novel &quot;A Woman Called Suyue&quot; was adapted into a TV series and broadcast on CCTV. The background music of this TV series was composed of a song called &quot; Yin Xueyun was deeply moved by the sound of Xun&#39;s musical instrument and decided to use &quot;Xun&quot; to name the cities in her future works. From then on, &quot;Xun City&quot; became another literary landmark of hers. At that time, she was helping the county write county chronicles. Due to the influence of CCTV, the county party committee specially gave her a quota, and she was directly transferred from a temporary worker to a national cadre.谈到这里，尹学芸不住感叹：“文学改变命运，真的是文学改变命运。”&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;&lt;span>;和乡村不一样的是，机关把人分出了很多层面，领导和非领导、年龄大的和年龄小的，甚至身后的背景都会有人刻意衡量和揣测，在单位里，人总要面对很多不同的人，处理很多不同的关系，在这样复杂又温吞的日常生活里，她拓展着人灵魂自省的深度。 《士别十年》&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #888888;&quot;>;（2015年发表）&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;是一个典型的人性在机关工作里蜕变的故事，这本小说很早就开始写，中间被搁置在电脑里长达十年，十年的时间，让“看事物总是一厢情愿，见不得任何形式主义，眼里容不得一粒沙子”的文艺女青年郭缨子，学会了察言观色、收敛锋芒，成了办公室里八面玲珑、酒局上左右逢源的主任，与当初的缨子处境极像的陈丹果不堪领导骚扰和同事孤立，跳楼自杀，陈丹果的死让缨子意识到自己已沉沦为帮凶，也向读者提出一个发人深省的追问：世俗的成功是否以丧失常识和常态生活为代价？这部小说引起了很多人的共鸣，并获得百花文学奖的认可。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;小说问世之前，尹学芸在文学上也经历了一段“温水煮青蛙”的时间。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;她对名利一直不敏感。用她的话来说，偏远山区的作者远离了都市，也就远离了名利场，所以人一直是潜在深水里的状态，想漂浮都难。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;90年代之后，尹学芸给人的印象是写作停顿了几年。那时她年纪尚轻，时不时发表点小说、散文，办着一份小刊物，和相识的作者到处赏花、打牌、野餐，每天乐乐呵呵的。但很快她感到疲乏。虽然一直有作品发出来，但常联系的刊物只有几家，小说在一个小圈子里撞来撞去，没有向上的动力。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;走出了山洼，年岁渐长之后，她想到了以前没想过的事情。 “你生活在一个山高皇帝远的地方，好处是自己比较自由，坏处也是自己比较自由，没人督促你。后来认识河北那些作家，特别羡慕人家有这样一个三五个人的小团体，写东西知道好在哪、不好在哪。但那时候我在有的地方发了也没人看见，也没人告诉你应该怎么走。”尹学芸说。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;好在，基层作家之间的善意“接住”了她。在她小说写得不温不火时，有经验的作家给她指路——去更生活化、读者更多的晚报发表。于是她开始为晚报写小说，也写散文、随笔，内容更加丰富了，侃足球、忆乡村、拉家常，什么都写。那段时间，她天天傍晚去登山，一边登山一边琢磨写作，“有的时候一串题材在后面排队，总有很多可写的东西，就是这样一种感觉，让你觉得生活就是很有意思的。”尹学芸形容。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;报纸的专栏发稿量大，一次要发好几篇，她想到了写自己生活的乡村中慢慢消失的词语。眼看着城镇化不断加速，农村一些具有历史意义和地方色彩的场景变得面目模糊。乡民走入城市，存于50到70年代之间的许多方言词汇退出人们的交流，有相当一部分在80年代初即已成历史。为了不让这些词语悄无声息地消失，她走遍了县境里大大小小的村庄，从本地人口中挖来那些字词。有些词传播的地域广阔，有些词在南方和北方、古代和现代的用法不一样，有的口音难以用文字模拟，遇到难以把握的部分，她也跟天南海北的网友讨论。这段在田垄上的寻访经历，留下了诸如“开圈”&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #888888;&quot;>;（队里把地里的白薯、花生或小麦都收完了，允许社员们去刨遗留下的白薯、花生或拣拾残留在地上的麦穗）&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;、“新宿”&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #888888;&quot;>;（偶尔借宿在别人家里）&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;、“看青”&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #888888;&quot;>;（在庄稼即将成熟、由绿转黄的时候看守庄稼，防止别人偷粮食）&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;等百个乡村词语的记录，后来成书为《慢慢消失的乡村词语》&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #888888;&quot;>;（2009年出版）&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;写了几年散文、专栏，她逐渐找到了自己写作的感觉，整个城市的百姓也知道了她。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/09/04/c460ca9c53226d3823b9f98c2f0cb4c8.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;

&lt;p>;&lt;span>;2014年对尹学芸来说是个特殊的年份，她发了五部中篇小说，写出了《李海叔叔》和《士别十年》，进入了作品的井喷期。直到现在，她和这几部作品的命运仍然让她唏嘘。当时一部中篇小说《玲珑塔》被退稿，她怎么也想不明白退稿的原因，就把稿子给了《收获》杂志，编辑不到一周就打电话来提出了修改意见。等待终审的那几个月她什么也没干，不知道自己是怎么过来的。她对自己说，终审过了再开始写，终审不过以后就不写了。那年她50岁，到了女干部离岗的年龄，如果稿子没有给《收获》、没有过审，她也许会换一个活法。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;终审还是过了，《收获》发表《玲珑塔》后，陆续有编辑找尹学芸约稿。她第一个写的就是《李海叔叔》，但因为版面的问题一直搁置。她又把另一篇稿子拿给编辑提意见，被对方要走发表，这篇就是《士别十年》。 “我老跟那些作家朋友说，不用着急，自己慢慢写，你自己有机会，作品有机会，来了就来了。有的时候反正你找也找不到，这又不是一部作品就怎么样的时代。”尹学芸说。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;第二年尹学芸继续发力，发了10部中篇，到2016年发了14部。她至今都觉得那段时间的生产力是不可思议的。 “虽然说那个时候都已经不是创作力最好的时候了，但是你会觉得文学突然给你打开了一扇窗，你可以抓住这样一个机会，其实那个时候没有任何人告诉你应该怎么样，但是自己真是有这种感觉。”她说。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/09/04/ef2d03ef4a1659a5a7086bcd87ce3563.png&quot;

data-key=&quot;159104&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;&lt;span>;士别三十年&lt;/span>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;近年来，尹学芸的视野从乡村跨越到城市，投向城乡之间的牵扯、纠结和疼痛。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;离开故乡30年后，她写了一篇名字骇人的《喂鬼》，小说的主人公云丫为躲避故乡的干娘临终前指派她在葬礼上为其“喂鬼”的仪式，急匆匆与网友阿祥相约远赴云南旅行。一路上却不断接到来自干娘的大儿子的催促和央告，令她心神不安。结果旅行结束返回埙城，她还是按照干娘的遗愿去喂鬼，才知道喂鬼只是一个很简单的佛教法事&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #888888;&quot;>;（“喂鬼”也叫“放焰口”，其实就是赈济鬼魂，给予法食令其饱满。）&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;。三个多月后，云丫接到电话，她的朋友阿祥已在三个月前死于一场车祸。这是一场徒劳的出走。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;尹学芸谈起这篇小说的创作时说：“很多时候故乡就是一枚爱人，有时候让你想着法地逃离，可更多的时候，又让你想着法地回归。有对比才有反差，有反差才有不同情感方式的表达。”&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;尽管作为基层工作者，尹学芸还是需要经常跟乡村打交道，但已经不是小时候那种生活在其中的状态，而是客居。年龄大了，和乡村的距离也在拉大，她和家乡的那些人、事之间有了一层越来越碍眼的隔膜。过去她喜欢把熟悉的人反复用在多部作品里，刻画人物不同的侧面，把故事写得满满当当，但现在她的生活里已经很难找到这样的人。在《寻隐者不遇》中，现代人的神龙见首不见尾，人与人之间感情的淡薄、疏远，通过大量留白表现出来。再也找不到《李海叔叔》里那种长达二十多年的精神连接。 “再然后你就发现，其实你跟所有的故乡、所有的乡村都是隔膜的，其实变化的不是它们，是你自己，很多时候都是你的眼睛变了，或者你的心也变了，我回去得越来越少了，跟他们的交往越来越少了。”尹学芸说。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;作为以乡村题材见长的作家，她不得不对这种隔膜警惕起来：“作品中的那种温度其实都在退，那种底色都在褪。我觉得是作家的通病，可能隔一段就得反思，怎么在生活中找到切口，这是很重要的。”&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #888888;&quot;>;（参考资料：《尹学芸印象》《尹学芸：没有哪段生活是白费的》《尹学芸：我曾被这盏灯照亮也期待它照亮更多人》《专访」尹学芸：最基层的作者离文坛很遥远，发再多小说也不是著名作家》《尹学芸：乡村的秩序》，感谢译林出版社和邓郁为采访提供的帮助）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;如今，这两家仓储会员店不仅可以满足消费者的购物需求，也可以满足他们凑热闹、看八卦的需求，因为8月以来，山姆与盒马的“小学生打架”就没有停止过。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;高端的商战，往往采用最朴素的方式，那就是我的商品比你低1元。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;此前，山姆与盒马为一块榴莲千层蛋糕“打”得不可开交——榴莲千层最先由山姆热卖，一块128元，盒马直接标价一块99元。山姆不服输，把榴莲千层的价格打到88元，盒马降到86元，山姆就调到85元，几个回合下来，蛋糕价格一度降至79元。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;随后，从月饼西瓜到鸡蛋小零食都卷入这场商战，很多人疑惑，山姆与盒马为何要“小学生打架”？价格战能让他们顺利地圈到中产消费者吗？&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;巨头们各有烦恼&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;正当传统商超经营普遍陷入困境时，带有批发性质的仓储会员商店发展得如火如荼。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;仓储会员店走的量贩售卖模式，大包装、品类多、价格优惠，消费者每隔一段时间才去大采购一次。艾媒咨询数据显示，2021年仓储会员超市行业市场规模达304.3亿元，2022年市场规模达335亿元，预计到2025年有望接近400亿元。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;作为中国仓储会员商店的头部品牌，山姆会员店和盒马X店各有风光，也各有烦恼，不得不铆足劲头竞争。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;山姆会员店已成为沃尔玛业绩中重要的增长点。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;根据沃尔玛第二季度的数据，第二季度总营收为1616亿美元，同比增长5.7%或5.4%（受汇率影响），营业利润同比增长5亿美元，增长率为6.7%。其中，沃尔玛中国净销售额为41亿美元，同比增长21.7%，仓储会员业务与电商业务增长亮眼。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;山姆会员店坐稳国内仓储会员店的头把交椅。一方面，1996年，山姆就在深圳开了中国第一家仓储会员店，将仓储会员的模式与理念传输到国内。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;另一方面，作为世界500强常年的第一名，沃尔玛在全球范围内建立了庞大、稳固的供应链体系，沃尔玛旗下的山姆会员店能够以更低的价格拿到更高品质的商品，并让利给消费者。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;山姆会员店1983年就在美国开了第一家店，至今已经有40年历史，它的积淀与经验是其他仓储会员店一时半会还难以比拟的。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;然而，山姆也有烦恼，那就是模仿者、竞争者甚至是“碰瓷者”太多了。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;同样诞生于美国的Costco，主打仓储会员模式，是山姆的老对手，麦德龙、家乐福等国外品牌也穷追不舍，至于国内，诚如永辉、盒马等来势汹汹，尤其是后起之秀的盒马X店，已经渐渐对山姆形成严峻挑战。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;对于成立于2015年的盒马来说，历史尽管不长，走过的弯路也不少，除了招牌的盒马鲜生以外，盒马此前推出的盒马小站、盒马MINI、盒马集市和盒马邻里等，大都已经铩羽而归。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;目前盒马形成三个比较稳定的业务，一个是盒马鲜生，一个是盒马奥莱店（折扣店），另外一个就是仓储会员模式的盒马X店。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;今年，阿里巴巴启动“1+6+N”组织变革，盒马只是“N”中的一部分，在集团中的地位有所下滑，盒马还是阿里最有希望上市的业务之一。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;如果只是盒马鲜生盈利肯定是不够的，所以，X店成为盒马的重中之重，被寄予厚望。除了赶紧多开店外，更是要抢占市场份额，提升盈利能力。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;瞄准中产，抢占中产&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;仓储会员店的目标客户，是中国新兴的中产阶层。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;山姆会员店早在1996年就在中国大陆开了第一家，不过，截至2016年，整整20年时间也仅只有16家店。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;伴随着中国中产阶层的迅速崛起，山姆会员店才迎来爆发式增长，从2017年至今6年不到的时间，山姆会员店已经新增了29家店，目前大陆已经有45家山姆会员店，预计到今年底将达到48家。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;仓储会员店的中产属性，另一个标志是它并不便宜的年费。比如山姆普通会员费为260元，盒马X黄金会员年费为258元。值得注意的是，会员费的期限只有一年，并且不能抵现。换句话说，得先花260元才能进入山姆消费，哪怕你一年在山姆什么也没买，260元也是不能返还的。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;会员费门槛自然阻隔了很大一部分消费者，无疑也会提高付费消费者的购物黏性，办了这里的会员卡，当然会来这里高频购物，才不会浪费了会员费。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;凭借强大的供应链和议价能力，仓储会员店也会努力以“物美又全、价格合理”的商品，让消费者的260元的会员费花得不亏。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;山姆与盒马对准的都是具有较好的经济基础、对生活品质有高追求的中产尤其是中产家庭，二者的用户高度重合。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;据月狐iAPP所示，山姆与盒马的用户重合率达到43.1%。而今年2月，沃尔玛中国区CEO朱晓静在一场内部讲话中表示，山姆唯一竞争对手可能就是盒马。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;这一次也是盒马率先发起针对山姆的“价格战”，盒马的畅销活动叫“移山价”，一语双关，既是愚公移山，也是要移走山姆。这名称，“小学生打架”的意味蛮浓。搞笑的是，美团也一度加入战局，推出的价格叫“拔河价”，这“河”，不正是“盒马”吗？&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;谁能“打赢”这群架&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;在这场仓储会员领域的群架中，谁能“打赢”？&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;单靠价格战，并不是最优解。既因为不可持续，也因为价格战只针对少数的商品品类，并非全线都比对方低价。更关键的是，中产在意的并不是那一两块钱的差距，很多人愿意花贵一点的价格购买更优品质的商品。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;所以，仓储会员商店还是得回到根本上来：“物美又全，价格合理”——这考验的仍然是供应链的强度与韧性。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;能否在全球范围内，以更低的价格采买优质的产品？从采购到上架，需要多长时间？如何确保货柜上的热门商品能够源源不断提供？消费者网上采购，能够以多快的速度送货上门？能否不断提供爆款的自营产品？&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;它们都与供应链有关。在这一点上，山姆与Costco布局多年、树大根深，确实需要盒马不断追赶。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;作为本土品牌，盒马的优势是带有更加鲜明的“本土化”特色，更加契合国人的一些消费需求。比如中国正步入单身社会，单身的中产越来越多，山姆会员店那种超大量的贩卖模式不适合这些单身中产，盒马的X会员店，就很注重经营小包装商品。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;中国的电商经济高度发达，盒马背靠阿里健全成熟的物流体系，送货上门的速度极快，反之，Costco不久前才推出到家配送服务，真的是姗姗来迟。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;再比如，下沉市场仍是仓储会员商店未充分开发的领地，盒马主打折扣商品和临期商品的奥莱店，可以在一线城市扎根，在下沉市场也有很大的想象空间……&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;山姆、盒马等仓储会员店该如何扬长避短，好戏还在后头。无论如何，它们充分竞争是好事一件，帮消费者把价格打下来，消费者还能顺便看看八卦，何乐不为。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 06 Oct 2023 10:26:35 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
