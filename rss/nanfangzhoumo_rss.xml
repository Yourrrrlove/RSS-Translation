The employee, Mr. Jiang, resigned and left Changsha after compensating the other party 10,000 yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The surveillance video that Mr. Jiang previously posted online showed that the woman involved, Hu, was holding a shopping bag and yelling at the little girl. Later, she took her child to the Western restaurant where Mr. Jiang worked and asked her child to explain to her the process of causing trouble. At this moment, Hu lost control. He put down the shopping bag in his hand, lifted the chair next to him and tried to hit the girl. Mr. Jiang and his colleagues stepped forward to stop him. A nearby merchant revealed in an interview with a reporter from Hunan TV that when the mother and daughter passed by his store, the girl suddenly fell down and the ice cream in her hand spilled on the floor, causing her clothes to be stained. Immediately, Hu lost control of his emotions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Mr. Jiang said that after the incident, Hu came to the restaurant many times, saying that he should not have spread the video online and threatened to die in the restaurant. After mediation by the local police station, Mr. Jiang paid the other party 10,000 yuan in compensation for mental losses and medical expenses, and then voluntarily submitted his resignation to his boss. Netizens expressed: &quot;Those who hit people are fine, but those who stopped them will be punished&quot;, &quot;I really feel sorry for this doll when I see this video&quot;, and some netizens said, &quot;It&#39;s really chilling.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The restaurant employee got into trouble when he prevented the woman Hu from beating her daughter in public and uploading the video to the Internet. This matter involves many aspects, including domestic violence, public supervision, privacy rights and law enforcement issues. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First of all, it must be clear that Hu’s behavior of beating his daughter in public is a typical act of domestic violence. It not only violates public order and good customs, but also violates relevant laws. According to Article 2 of the Anti-Domestic Violence Law of the People&#39;s Republic of China, domestic violence refers to physical, mental and other violations committed by family members in the form of beating, binding, mutilation, restriction of personal freedom, regular verbal abuse, and intimidation. Article 5 stipulates that minors, the elderly, disabled people, pregnant and lactating women, and seriously ill patients who suffer domestic violence shall be given special protection. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is the duty of the police station to deal with Hu’s illegal behavior as soon as possible. Article 33 of the Anti-Domestic Violence Law of the People&#39;s Republic of China stipulates that if the perpetrator commits domestic violence and constitutes a violation of public security management, he shall be subject to public security management penalties in accordance with the law. It can be seen that when parents beat their children, law enforcement agencies cannot turn a blind eye on the grounds that &quot;honest officials cannot handle household matters.&quot; In this incident, Hu publicly beat his daughter, which caused a very bad public perception. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for the restaurant employee Mr. Jiang’s behavior of publishing the video, from a legal perspective, he did not infringe on Hu’s portrait rights. Because this is an exposure of illegal activities in public places, Mr. Jiang is exercising the citizen’s right to supervise. Article 1020 of the Civil Code stipulates that the following acts may be reasonably carried out without the consent of the portrait right holder: other acts of making, using, or disclosing the portrait of the portrait right holder in order to safeguard public interests or the legitimate rights and interests of the portrait right holder. By exposing his video, Mr. Jiang obviously hopes to draw social attention to the phenomenon of domestic violence and jointly protect the rights of minors. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Taking a step back, even if Hu believes that his rights and interests have been violated, he should protect his rights and interests through legal means such as litigation, rather than through improper means such as making trouble. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hu made trouble in the restaurant many times. However, the police station did not hold him accountable. Instead, through mediation, Mr. Jiang was asked to compensate 10,000 yuan for mental damages and medical expenses. This move not only chilled Mr. Jiang&#39;s heart, but also sent a wrong signal: If illegal acts can be resolved through mediation, or even reverse compensation can be obtained, wouldn&#39;t it condone more people&#39;s willful behavior? In this way, the law loses its majesty and justice. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As a law enforcement agency, it should be based on the law, focus on protecting the rights and interests of minors and the courageous behavior of citizens, and have zero tolerance for illegal activities, so as to form a legal deterrent and guide social atmosphere. Improve the quality of citizens through legal education. Regrettably, the police station allowed the parties’ emotions to influence the outcome of the case, acquiescing to the woman’s behavior of “getting more and more unreasonable”. Such mediation is inconsistent with legal principles. Netizens generally questioned this mediation and expressed their simple view of justice. Law enforcement agencies should re-investigate the matter and hold the offenders accountable, rather than letting those who bravely act for justice lose money and jobs. Only in this way can people&#39;s faith in judicial authority not be damaged. After all, the majesty and credibility of the law are often reflected in the daily actions of law enforcers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti , Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;(This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 22 Sep 2023 21:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[如果你导弹打得不够准，是因为你人靠得不够近丨军事]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257374]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-22 20:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/20/gup4AaFCsszUqfElPfxsoCHZgB5ey11TUdvQehIu.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/gup4AaFCsszUqfElPfxsoCHZgB5ey11TUdv QehIu. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251331&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;September 13, 2023, Sevastopol, Crimea region, Smoke billowed out from the attacked shipyard &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Recently, Ukrainian news said that the Ukrainian military In the early morning of September 13, 2023, 10 missiles and 3 unmanned boats launched an attack on the Sevastopol military base in the Crimean Peninsula, causing a fire at the Sevastopol Shipyard and two ships under repair were damaged. The losses include the Russian Black Sea Fleet&#39;s Ropcha-class landing ship &quot;Minsk&quot; and the Kilo-class diesel-powered submarine &quot;Rostov-on-Don&quot; which cost up to US$300 million and was commissioned in 2014. Rostov-on-Don). Satellite images of the scene showed that the two ships were severely damaged and were extremely difficult and expensive to repair. Considering that such a project was difficult to complete under the wartime system, they basically had to be scrapped. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Russia also admitted that it was attacked by Ukrainian missiles and that some ships were damaged. The situation announced by both sides basically confirmed the results of this attack. This is the largest loss suffered by the Black Sea Fleet since the sinking of the flagship Moskva after the war between Russia and Ukraine. It also sets a record for the first time in history that a submarine is hit by a missile. What’s even more amazing is that just two days after this attack, Ukraine announced that it had used missiles and drones to attack the S-400 air defense missile system on the Crimean Peninsula. This system has always been considered the strongest in Russia. Currently in active air defense weapons, Turkey even had tense relations with the United States and NATO in order to purchase this system. This time, it was beheaded by Ukraine behind enemy lines in actual combat, which was shocking. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This round of continuous attacks with a combination of punches is obviously not the result of an accident, but a joint military operation between the Ukrainian intelligence agencies and the Ministry of Defense, in which the actions of the Ukrainian special forces can be said to be indispensable. without. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Two days before launching the missile attack, that is, on September 11, the Ukrainian intelligence agency announced that the special forces had successfully seized two offshore oil and gas drilling platforms in the Black Sea and successfully removed Russian equipment from the platforms. military installations. The map shows that the two platforms captured by the Ukrainian special forces are about fifty kilometers away from the Crimean coastline. The Russian army has set up air and sea warning radars on them to control the Black Sea area. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This attack did not attract much attention from domestic public opinion. Some media even believed that it was a political show after Ukraine’s counterattack failed, because the battle to seize the two platforms was not fierce and not too big. military value. However, in my opinion, the battle to seize the sea platform is the prelude to this attack, because Ukraine does not have stealth fighter equipment that can penetrate the enemy&#39;s air defense network, so it must try to shorten the reaction time of the opponent&#39;s air defense weapons, and these two This platform happens to be Russia&#39;s peripheral observation point. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before the start of the 2003 Iraq War, the U.S. military used special forces to successfully seize three Iraqi offshore drilling platforms in the Persian Gulf. On the other hand, it is to prevent Iraq from dumping oil into the Persian Gulf and polluting the environment like it did during the Gulf War. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During the operation that year, in addition to the British and American special forces, the Polish Thunder Special Task Force also assumed the offensive mission of a platform. This kind of battle to seize maritime platforms is referred to as VBSS (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: italics, italics_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Visit, board, search and seize&lt;/span>;) in the field of special operations. VBSS The mission is often only accomplished by elite maritime special operations units. The complexity of such operations lies in the fact that it involves combat maneuvers from underwater to the surface, and also includes extremely close indoor combat. It not only requires a large amount of pre-war reconnaissance, but also requires a large amount of targeted actual combat training by operational units before they can make up their minds to implement it. This kind of maritime point-taking operation generally cannot be just a political statement mission, because the risks and costs are too high. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It can be seen from the missile attack two days later that Ukraine&#39;s action to seize the Black Sea drilling platform is only part of its huge action plan. In fact, the follow-up actions are the key to victory. After the submarine and landing ship were attacked by missiles, Ukraine launched a missile attack one day later. The battle rhythm seemed not compact enough. But in fact, the U.S. special forces did not delay after seizing the platform. Another attack team quietly landed on the Crimean Peninsula under the cover of night, approached the submarines and landing ships in the shipyard, and used thermal imaging Shoot it from multiple angles. After the attack, these latent special operations personnel conducted reconnaissance and assessment of the bombing effects before quietly withdrawing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Because air-launched missile attacks involve issues with the angle of incidence, it is necessary to construct a three-dimensional image of the target, and the inspection needs to confirm its radar information or thermal imaging information, all of which require multi-angle technical reconnaissance. The United States may be able to rely on its powerful satellite and reconnaissance aircraft platforms for reconnaissance. For Ukraine, which lacks technical reconnaissance means, using special forces or covert operators to conduct close reconnaissance is a good alternative. And even for a country like the United States with strong technical reconnaissance capabilities, close-in reconnaissance by special forces is still one of the optional methods. For example, during the Gulf War, the United States sent multiple special operations teams into Iraq in order to find Iraqi Scud missiles. Conduct close reconnaissance from the rear. In addition, for collecting the signal characteristics of enemy air defense weapons, deploying special operations personnel for close detection is also a very feasible method, because with only a set of signal receivers, these lurking personnel can obtain the spectrum information of surrounding warning radars for a long time , and can also obtain more comprehensive signal intelligence. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many people believe that the emergence of drones can replace special operations personnel, but in fact it is people, not machines, who win wars. Only when the quality of people matches technical means can we defeat powerful opponents. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 22 Sep 2023 20:26:05 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[10人遇难，强龙卷风突袭江苏后，救灾与保险赔付正进行]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257406]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-22 19:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/22/d0f40bac84.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/22/d0f40bac84. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251665&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On September 20, the scene of the tornado disaster in Nancai Township, Suqian City.

This sudden disaster hit parts of Suqian City and Yancheng City, Jiangsu Province on September 19, 2023. According to official reports from the two places, a total of 10 people were killed and 8 injured. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Two days later, on Liyuan Road, Nancai Township, Suqian City, Li Peng had been immersed in picking up all kinds of debris at home and in the supermarket, and cleaning the passage; in another town in the city, Daxing Town North Street, a 68-year-old Chen Jianqiang climbed up to the roof of his house, collected the tiles blown by the tornado, and prepared to re-roof the roof. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The two-kilometer-long Nancai Township South Street has generally returned to its usual order. Downed trees and broken glass have been cleared away, and temporary stalls are ready to be set up. Among the photos provided by local residents on the 20th, only the pears on the small truck were half burnt and blackened by the high-voltage cables that fell on the day of the tornado, and they were still stacked neatly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this tornado, the tornadoes in Daxing Town, Suyu District, Suqian City and Nancai Township, Economic Development Zone were EF2, and the tornadoes in Lupu Town and Banhu Town, Funing County, Yancheng City were EF3. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the Jiangsu Provincial Meteorological Service Center’s official Weibo account “Jiangsu Meteorology”, the intensity of tornadoes is divided into levels from EF0 to EF5. Tornadoes of level EF2 and above are generally called strong tornadoes, and tornadoes of level EF2 are generally called strong tornadoes. It can cause considerable damage, it can uproot trees; an EF3 tornado can even knock over a train. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Suqian, tornadoes are not a common natural disaster and they come and go quickly. In Yancheng, according to the Propaganda Department of the Funing County Party Committee in Yancheng City, an average of 4.8 tornadoes occur in Jiangsu every year, of which 2.6 occur in Yancheng. Yancheng is the urban area with the highest frequency of occurrence. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“I was so scared at that moment”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;When the tornado hit at around 5 o’clock in the evening on September 19, Luo Qi was picking up his children from school and did not notice it. figure. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When I got home, the street was in a mess. Luo Qi saw that on South Street, electric wires were blazing and cars were on fire. There is a small market on the street every day, right in front of Luo Qi&#39;s house. One of the sheds in front of her house was blown away and disappeared, and the other one was tied to a tree with a rope, but it hit the freezer. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Luo Qi checked the surveillance video at home and found that the three minutes before the tornado struck were unusually calm, with only light rain falling. Starting at 17:11, the surveillance video recorded a loud wind noise, and the shed at the door was blown. Then the wind became louder and louder, a red four-corner tent floated by the roadside, the big box was blown away, and all the small objects on the ground began to fly everywhere. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Luo Qi said that the child&#39;s grandmother was washing vegetables at the door. When she saw something was wrong and wanted to go back into the house, the tricycle was blown up by the wind and pushed against the wall. The car window glass penetrated her elbows and feet, and she went to the hospital that night for stitches. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The stall owner next to Luo Qi’s house was not so lucky. He was picked up by the wind and fell to the other side of the road. At that time, a wrist-thick main cable suddenly fell down on the street, bursting into flames, and everyone was afraid of being electrocuted. &quot;I was so frightened at that moment.&quot; Luo Qi said that it was the first time in more than 30 years that she had seen such a violent tornado. The stall owner&#39;s wife kept asking for help, but no one dared to rescue her. Later, the police cordoned off the scene, and the cables were still on fire after the power was artificially cut off. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On Liyuan Road, which intersects with South Street, Li Peng opened a small supermarket. In his memory, the tornado lasted no more than a few minutes. But in those few minutes, the tornado tore off almost all the roofs on both sides of the street. &quot;Those asbestos tiles and sheds were hanging in the sky, as high as an airplane, blowing everywhere.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Peng’s home is a 16-year-old tile-roofed house. Since the house has never had any problems before, Li Peng has not reinforced or renovated the house. The tile-roofed house suffered heavy losses in this tornado. The roof kept leaking and the furniture and doors inside were smashed. &quot;I haven&#39;t calculated the amount of damage. I can only make detailed statistics when repairs start.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When the tornado moved all the way to Daxing Town, it was already around 6 o&#39;clock. Fante, a 14-year-old girl, just came home from school. She saw a black thing slowly rolling up from a distance. &quot;It seemed to be connected to the sky, very long.&quot; During dinner, the lights at home flickered on and off, and soon the power went out. A strong wind blew into Fanter&#39;s house. Grandma went to block the two glass doors, but she couldn&#39;t close them. Fanter ran to help, &quot;but there was a strong suction that sucked me to the door and blew me into the tree.&quot; Fanter, who weighed 85 pounds, hugged the big tree outside the door and did not dare to move. He did not come down along the trunk until the wind stopped. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to &quot;Jiangsu Weather&quot; news on September 20, Jiangsu was affected by two tornadoes on September 19. The first tornado was in Suqian Economic Development Zone and Daxing Town from 17:00 to 18:00; the other was in Funing County, Yancheng City from 20:16 to 35:00. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the official public account of the Suqian Emergency Management Bureau, the tornado disaster mainly occurred in towns and villages, with densely populated areas, complex building structures, and the occurrence period coincided with off-duty hours. According to preliminary statistics, 5,512 people were affected by the strong tornado, 1,646 houses were generally damaged, 137 houses collapsed, 41.8 hectares of crops were damaged, 405 people were temporarily relocated, and some walls of more than 2,000 square meters of pig houses collapsed and the roof collapsed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/22/9a3ba8adc3.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/22/9a3ba8adc3.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251666&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On the roadside in Nancai Township, electric workers are repairing lines.

Relatively speaking, tornadoes occur more frequently in Yancheng City. The private rescue teams along the Jiangsu coast have conducted targeted training on thunderstorms and hurricanes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At around 6 pm on the 19th, 13 members of the Blue Sky Rescue Team rushed to Nancai Township, Economic Development Zone. The local fire rescue team had arrived at the scene. The Blue Sky Team members assisted in clearing down fallen trees and scattered debris. etc., to open up a smooth road; at the same time, we checked the power supply lines to prevent secondary disasters such as leakage. &quot;We continued working until two o&#39;clock in the morning the next day.&quot; Road cleanup in Nancai Township was basically completed on the 20th. Suqian Blue Sky Rescue Team sent 12 reinforcements to Daxing Town in the afternoon to investigate the disaster situation, mainly assisting township staff to verify whether there were any people who had lost contact after the disaster. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sun Wei said that after the tornado passes through, another task is to clean up the debris on the facade of the building. For example, the air conditioner on the edge of the eaves was blown to the outside of the bracket and needs to be adjusted. The severely damaged roof There are broken tiles on the floor, which should be cleaned as soon as possible. &quot;Prevent the heavy rain after the tornado from falling down the originally skewed items, causing secondary disasters.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For Chen Jianqiang and his wife, residents of North Street in Daxing Town, the main problem is that after the roof tiles are broken, How to fall asleep at night. Daughter Chen Guo said that the roof of her parents&#39; house had just been renovated a few days ago, and they spent three to four thousand yuan to replace the new tiles. Unexpectedly, the tornado ripped through most of the roof, and the electrical appliances in the house were also soaked in rain all night. Fortunately, the corridor was made of hard cement boards, so the two old men laid several layers of quilts on the corridor and spent the night. On September 20, my uncle, who was in his seventies, came to help repair the roof. I didn’t know when it would be repaired. Someone from the village registered the loss of the house, but the old man didn&#39;t know how to subsidize it in the future. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the evening of September 20, the Suqian Emergency Management Bureau issued a WeChat article stating that it had insured urban and rural residents of Suqian City with public safety urban and rural assistance insurance, which would cover urban and rural housing in Suqian City due to floods and typhoons. Compensation for house losses caused by natural disasters such as landslides, landslides, fires and explosions. The compensation standard is that for urban housing, the main structure insurance amount is 180,000 yuan/household, and the interior decoration insurance amount is 120,000 yuan/household; for rural housing, the main structure insurance amount is 180,000 yuan/household, and the interior decoration insurance amount is 40,000 yuan/household. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The underwriter of this project is mainly the Suqian Branch of the People&#39;s Insurance Company of China Co., Ltd. Zheng Xinbo, the company&#39;s contact person, told Southern Weekend reporters that this private housing insurance is purchased by the government, and each household pays 2 yuan. , have been purchasing continuously for many years. After the disaster occurred, they sent more than 30 staff to the villages and towns on the 20th to verify the damage and determine the damage. The first batch of compensation will be completed before the National Day holiday. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Relatively speaking, Yancheng City has more experience in dealing with tornadoes. Public information shows that on June 23, 2012, Yancheng &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: none;&quot;>;City&lt;/span>;&lt;a href=&quot;file://item/%E9%98%9C%E5% AE%81/871643%3ffromModule=lemma_inlink&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000; text-decoration: none;&quot;>;Funing&lt;/span>;&lt;/a>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000; text -decoration: none;&quot;>;,&lt;/span>;&lt;a href=&quot;file://item/%E5%B0%84%E9%98%B3/871862%3ffromModule=lemma_inlink&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000; text-decoration: none;&quot;>;Sheyang&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/a>;An EF4 tornado occurred in some areas, with winds exceeding level 17. 99 people were killed and 846 injured. The local government built the Yancheng Memorial Hall for Fighting the &quot;6.23&quot; Tornado. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Funing County Party Committee Propaganda Department stated that Funing County has also formulated corresponding emergency plans for natural disasters that occur more frequently. After the tornado, the &quot;9.19&quot; Typhoon Emergency Rescue Command was established in the affected town as soon as possible; special teams were arranged to go to each disaster-stricken village to find out the situation, grasp the disaster situation as soon as possible and report it quickly. Four rounds of sifting search and rescue operations were carried out overnight on September 19. In addition, 129 disaster-stricken people were urgently relocated and resettled by staying with relatives and friends, staying in hotels, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Jiangsu is a tornado-prone area in the country. According to &quot;Jiangsu Meteorology&quot; news, from 1956 to 2015, a total of 109 tornadoes occurred in Jiangsu, with the highest proportion occurring in summer, reaching 79.8%, with an annual average of 1.5. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The reason why Jiangsu is prone to tornadoes is that the province has a flat terrain, dense rivers and lakes, and is located in the north-south climate transition zone. Cold and warm air currents frequently meet, making it easy to form strong convective weather including tornadoes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The meteorological experts in the above article said that Jiangsu is usually less prone to tornadoes in mid-to-late September, but recently due to higher temperatures and the influence of the Jianghuai cyclone, relatively strong tornadoes have occurred. dynamic conditions. Against this background, a relatively rare tornado event occurred in Jiangsu on September 19. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the 21st, Wang Xiaohua, deputy director of the Jiangsu Provincial Meteorological Observatory, said in an interview with CCTV that the Jiangsu Provincial Meteorological Observatory has built a strong convection and strong wind demonstration system from 2021 to 2023. , some preliminary forecast and warning capabilities of tornadoes. In the next step, the meteorological department will use multi-source observation data such as multi-band radar collaborative observation to improve and optimize tornado early warning technology and indicators based on the characteristics of climate change, and further improve forecast and early warning capabilities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(Local residents are pseudonyms in the article)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 22 Sep 2023 19:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[白切鸡寿司走红，年轻人流行的“中餐日作”是真香吗？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257296]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-22 17:30:15&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 22 Sep 2023 17:55:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[钱锺书回避鲁迅？No，他开启了“悄悄关注”模式]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257339]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-22 17:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/22/Al0NA8piZmtUhLaOo6f35jIRv7oOmF4B0asgnIe8.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;732&quot; height=&quot;487&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/22/Al0NA8piZmtUhLaOo6f35jIRv7oOmF4B 0asgnIe8. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251595&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;From left: Lin Yutang, Lu Xun, Soong Ching Ling, Smedley, Li Peihua (Secretary of Soong Ching Ling) ). &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Information picture/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although Qian Zhongshu rarely talked about Lu Xun publicly, he could not &quot;avoid&quot; Lu Xun. Crystal once said in &quot;Miscellaneous Notes of Shi Qian&#39;s Throwing Books&quot; that at a symposium, Qian Zhongshu praised Lu Xun&#39;s short stories for being well written, but not suitable for long stories. The most well-known person is Qian Zhongshu&#39;s opening speech at the &quot;Lu Xun and Chinese and Foreign Culture&quot; academic seminar. This article was later published in &quot;Literary Journal&quot; on October 23, 1986, and collected in &quot;The Edge of Life&quot;. In his opening speech, Qian Zhongshu said a few words &quot;as usual&quot; based on people&#39;s &quot;public opinion&quot; of Lu Xun at that time: &quot;Lu Xun was a great man. The greater the figure, the more aspects can be observed; &#39;Chinese and foreign culture&#39; is a big The bigger the topic, the wider the scope of the problems that can occur.&quot; The main spirit of his speech was to hope that everyone can &quot;speak freely without bending the meaning to seek consensus&quot;, and could not see the true evaluation of Lu Xun. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, Qian Zhongshu and Lu Xun also had a period of time in the same city. In September 1927, Lu Xun left Guangzhou and lived in Shanghai until his death in October 1936. Qian Zhongshu graduated from Tsinghua University in the summer of 1933 and taught at Guanghua University. He began studying at Oxford in the autumn of 1935, so he spent more than two years in Shanghai. However, they were only from the same city, and the two of them had never been seen crossing paths. However, as a later scholar and because of Lu Xun&#39;s huge influence, Qian Zhongshu inevitably had to &quot;encounter&quot; Lu Xun intentionally or unintentionally when writing. &quot;On the Parallel Study of Lu Xun and Qian Zhongshu&quot; written by Liu Yukai and &quot;On the Comparative Study of Lu Xun and Qian Zhongshu Literature&quot; written by Sui Qing&#39;e have all made comparisons from an academic level. Scholars such as Xie Yong, Wang Peijun, Li Guotao and Qian Zhijun have made comparisons in their writings. There are also elucidations from time to time, and I would like to unearth several examples related to Lu Xun from Qian Zhongshu&#39;s writings, which may fill the gaps. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In &quot;The Besieged City&quot;, Sun Roujia&#39;s uncle and aunt hold important positions in a large cotton factory and have always looked down upon Fang Hongjian. Once, Fang Hongjian and Sun Roujia quarreled again over the arrival of his aunt. When he learned that his aunt wanted to find a position for him in the factory, he jumped up and shouted: &quot;Who wants her to find trouble for me? I can&#39;t even beg for food.&quot; Don&#39;t ask her for it! Isn&#39;t it enough that she has two lackeys, Bobby and you, Sun Roujia? You tell her that Fang Hongjian &#39;has no skills but a very bad temper&#39;, and you won&#39;t be a lackey of a capitalist lackey.&quot; This paragraph of text , immediately reminds people of Lu Xun&#39;s famous article &quot;&quot;Bereaved&quot; and &quot;The Capitalist&#39;s Lacking Lackey&quot; published in 1930, which criticized Liang Shiqiu. Although Qian Zhongshu was studying in Tsinghua University at the time, he would not have missed the articles on the Lu-Liang debate. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Article 84 of the first volume of the Commercial Press&#39;s &quot;Notes of Rong&#39;an Pavilion&quot;, reading the notes of Yue Ke&#39;s &quot;History&quot;, Qian Zhongshu excerpted the following paragraph in Volume 12 and added a note:&lt;/p>; p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;In the summer of the 10th year of the reign of Emperor Xizong (Wanyan) of the Jin Dynasty, Long Jian (present) in the Yuzhai Palace, there was a heavy thunderstorm Arrive, break the pillar and go away. Everyone was shocked, thinking it was ominous, and wanted to look at it in disgust. Some people thought that a general amnesty should be granted, so they called Zhang Jun, a bachelor, to draft the imperial edict. Among them are the words &quot;Gu Zi is ignorant&quot; and &quot;Looking at Yu Xiaozi&quot;. The translator did not know the meaning of Tuo Qianchong, so he said: &quot;Han&#39;er is strong in knowledge, and he relies on words to criticize my Lord&#39;s ears.&quot; When asked why, he translated and explained its meaning: &quot;The widowed is lonely and has no relatives; the ignorant is ignorant of human affairs; the eyes are blind; the brat is a child.&quot; He was furious and summoned Jun to question him, but he failed to answer him. , slash (cut) its mouth with a hand sword, and dig it with thorns. I didn&#39;t know that it was translated as &quot;foolishness&quot; or &quot;treachery&quot;. So... According to this, Lu Xun is also the ancestor of literal translation. &quot; (&quot;Notes of Rong&#39;an Pavilion&quot; page 146)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Jin Xizong Wanyan Dan was the third emperor of the Jin Dynasty. It is said that he studied under Han Fang before he came to the throne and was able to write poems in Chinese. After he came to the throne, he was especially diligent in studying Chinese classics. According to this article in the &quot;History of the Emperor&quot;, Wanyan Quan did not seem to be very proficient in Chinese, and the translator could only &quot;literally translate&quot;, taking out of context the commonly used imperial edicts. Formulas such as &quot;Gu Zi is ignorant&quot; and &quot;Xiao Yu Xiaozi&quot; can be &quot;directly interpreted&quot; as cursing the Lord, thus losing the original meaning of &quot;retreating, trusting, and rushing&quot;, and Zhang Jun was convicted.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Qian Zhongshu&#39;s note &quot;This is the ancestor of Lu Xun&#39;s literal translation&quot; naturally reminds people of the &quot;Lu-Liang Controversy&quot;. In September 1929, Liang Shiqiu published &quot;On Mr. Lu Xun&#39;s Life&quot; in &quot;Crescent&quot; &quot;Hard Translation&quot;&quot;, Lu Xun refuted it by publishing &quot;&quot;Hard Translation&quot; and &quot;The Class Character of Literature&quot;&quot; in &quot;Jinya Monthly&quot; in March of the following year. The debate has exceeded the boundaries of translation. As far as translation is concerned, Lu Xun advocated &quot;literal translation&quot; (or &quot;hard translation&quot;), such as the translation of &quot;The Symbol of Depression&quot;, which &quot;is translated sentence by sentence, or even word for word according to the rules&quot;, and its purpose is to &quot;prefer to believe rather than obey.&quot; Qian Zhongshu is obviously familiar with translation However, his views were different from those of Lu Xun, so Qian Zhongshu went on to write:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Yu Reading &quot;Shuowen&quot; to the &quot;Kou&quot; part of the 26th word &quot;囮: 译也&quot;, Chang sighs Ji Chang (Editor&#39;s note: refers to Xu Shen), a true saint, foresees Tradutore, traditore! Wang Yuanzhi&#39;s &quot;Little Animals Collection&quot; Volume 14 &quot;Translation Dui&quot; says: &quot;Translation means Yi. It can change one&#39;s mind if it is big, but it can only change one&#39;s words if it is small. &quot;So on and so forth. After liberation, the trend of translating books became more and more popular. They did not know how to make mistakes, but they were eaten alive. Not only were they changed beyond recognition, but their hearts and minds were completely changed. They were the so-called &quot;great translators&quot; in Xun Yuan Dynasty. Gu Tangsheng&#39;s &quot;Records of Zhang Wenxiang&#39;s Shogunate&quot; Juan Xia said: &quot;Chen Lanbin envoy to the United States, one of his attendants, Xu, is not familiar with Western languages. One day, he suddenly picked up the Western Newspaper and seemed to be reading it with gusto. His colleagues asked him strangely. Xu said: I can&#39;t understand the Western Newspaper. I read Zhu Jun&#39;s translation. Also puzzled. If you still don&#39;t understand, it would be better to just read the Western newspaper. &quot;In this way, both this and Zhang Jun&#39;s incident can be used as the motto of today&#39;s translators. (ibid., pp. 146-147)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This note is related to the fact that &quot;after liberation&quot; the translation industry &quot;does not know what to do. Talking about &quot;eating alive&quot; is also a denial of &quot;literal translation&quot;. Regarding translation, what Qian Zhongshu pursues is the realm of &quot;translation&quot;, although &quot;thorough and complete &#39;translation&#39; is an unattainable ideal.&quot; Therefore, Qian Zhongshu pursues In the article, Zhongshu praised Xu Shen (Jianchang) as a &quot;true saint&quot; and said that he could predict that the translation would be &quot;囮&quot; (false) and that the translator (Tradutore) was a traitor (traditore). For details, see &quot;Lin Shu&#39;s Translation&quot; and There are several discussions in &quot;Guan Zhui Bian&quot;. The following section of this article uses Gu Hongming&#39;s story of Xu reading a Western newspaper, and combined with Zhang Jun&#39;s view, he believes that &quot;all can be used as the motto of today&#39;s translators.&quot; It is humorous without losing irony, which is quite obvious. Qian Zhongshu&#39;s writing style is consistent. The most eye-catching part of the whole note is the note &quot;the ancestor of literal translation&quot;, just click on it.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the 1920s and 1930s, Lin Yutang was trying to change the &quot;Chinese-style humor&quot; &quot;The joking attitude of the gentleman is to reshape the virtues of the gentleman, so he advocates &quot;humorous literature&quot;. Unexpectedly, things are counterproductive, as Qian Zhongshu criticized in his essay &quot;Joking&quot;: &quot;Since the promotion of humorous literature, joking has become a literati career. &quot;Lin Yutang helped the &quot;current ills&quot; by rescuing &quot;current ills.&quot; The actual effect of &quot;humorous literature&quot; ran counter to its original intention. Qian Zhongshu&#39;s &quot;Jokes&quot; was inspired by &quot;humorous literature.&quot; As for Lin Yutang&#39;s ideas, Lu Xun In &quot;One Thought and Action&quot;, he once criticized: &quot;Boom, there is no shortage of humor and sketches in the world. &quot; (&quot;The Complete Works of Lu Xun&quot;, Volume 5, page 473) also pointed out in &quot;Explanation of &quot;Funny&quot;&quot; that humorous literature just gives &quot;slick, frivolous and obscene&quot; the &quot;title of &#39;humor&#39;&quot; (&quot;The Complete Works of Lu Xun&quot;) &quot;Volume 5, page 342). Some people therefore believe that &quot;Lu Xun and Qian Zhongshu really echo each other in their views on promoting humorous literature&quot; (Li Qinye, &quot;Reading &amp;lt;Writing on the Edge of Life&quot;), This statement is specious.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the history of modern literature, Lu Xun, Lin Yutang and Qian Zhongshu are all famous for their humor. Lu Xun&#39;s humor is like a dagger, with the edge of a scalpel to remove tumors, while Lin Yutang&#39;s humor is The breeze is like a purifier for the soul. At that time, Lin Yutang&#39;s humorous literature was naturally not as powerful as Lu Xun&#39;s essays, so it seemed out of date and was publicly criticized by Lu Xun. Qian Zhongshu&#39;s humor was like cold rain hitting his face, cold and thorny, like a pretender The embarrassment and uneasiness after his soul was exposed. However, although Qian Zhongshu also criticized Lin Yutang, if you compare his &quot;Laughing&quot; with Lin Yutang&#39;s &quot;On Humor&quot;, you will find how similar their views on humor are: Qian Zhongshu It is said that a person who is really humorous will have a &quot;knowing smile&quot; about humor. Lin Yutang said that a calm and distant bystander will give a &quot;knowing smile&quot; to humor; Qian Zhongshu said that humor is &quot;funny and wise&quot; , Lin Yutang said, &quot;wisdom has begun&quot; and &quot;there is humor&quot;; Qian Zhongshu said that humor is &quot;a breath of breath for the dull life&quot;, Lin Yutang said that humor is &quot;a part of life&quot;. Humor originates from wisdom, famous humorists It is not surprising that Qian Zhongshu and Lin Yutang have similar concepts but different expressions and effects. Because of this view of humor, Lin Yutang advocates humorous literature to cultivate the people&#39;s sense of humor and cultivate educated citizens, while Qian Zhongshu believes that true humor can &quot; &quot;Anti-bowing and laughing at oneself&quot; will become a laughing stock once advocated, so he said: &quot;Humor is at most a kind of temperament and can never be labeled as an idea, let alone a profession.&quot; ” It can be seen that although Qian Zhongshu and Lu Xun both criticized the “humorous literature” advocated by Lin Yutang, it cannot be said that their views on humor are of the same origin. On the contrary, Qian Zhongshu and Lin Yutang’s views on humor are “similar to each other.”&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;As a witness and participant in the same literary and artistic trend, although Qian Zhongshu never had direct contact with Lu Xun, it even made people think that he sometimes deliberately &quot;looked sideways&quot; at Lu Xun, and followed the trend to find out the source. If we open the &quot;fog&quot;, we can still see their figures at the same time in major events in the history of modern literature, and then we can see Qian Zhongshu&#39;s consistent indifferent attitude towards Shi Xian, including Lu Xun, &quot;It&#39;s like seeing from flying sand, wheat waves, and ripples &quot;The posture of the wind&quot; (Qian Zhong&#39;s calligraphy). (The original title of this article was &quot;The posture of the wind&quot;, the current title was proposed by the editor)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 22 Sep 2023 17:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[“4.2千年事件”：地球大降温，华夏新生]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257310]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-22 16:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;At the beginning of this century, with the advancement of molecular biology, we were able to explore the origin of rice through gene testing - detection结果显示，约1.35万年~ 8.2千年前，栽培水稻最早在长江流域被驯化，之后传播到东南亚以及南亚，与南亚的野生籼稻杂交后，产生了栽培籼米，又回流中国。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但在研究水稻起源的过程中，基因检测却带来了疑问。学者们猛然发现，其传播时间透着很多诡异之处：水稻被驯化后，长达数千年里，一直停留在中国，没有向外传播。然而到了约4.2千年~4千年前后，几乎是在同一时间，水稻忽然就出现在了日本列岛、朝鲜半岛、菲律宾、中南半岛和南亚次大陆。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这不禁让人疑惑：四千多年前到底发生了什么？ ! &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;从中国古籍来看，4000年前，正好是夏朝建立前后。相传大禹在治水后，曾派使者丈量“全世界”，最后计算出大地东西和南北的距离，都是二亿三万三千五百里零七十五步。这虽然只是《山海经》里的神话，但神话故事往往也有着原型：或许是大禹建立夏朝后，曾派出使者探索未知世界，顺便将水稻传播到了周边各国？ &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;然而考古上来看，4.2千年~4千年前的世界，正在遭受前所未有的巨大劫难。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;如果你关注中国考古，你可能听过“满天星斗”的说法，这是形容夏朝以前的各地古文明：5000~4300年前的中国，遍地都是考古遗址，西辽河有红山，黄河流域有龙山，这二者已是城邦文明；长江流域则有良渚和石家河，二者已进入王朝政治。当时的地球正处于著名的“全新世大暖期”，湿润温暖的气候让全世界文明都欣欣向荣，就连中亚沙漠和非洲的撒哈拉大沙漠，当时也是森林湖泊广布的宜居之所。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;然而到了4.2千年~4千年前，三大流域的文明全都崩溃，整个中华大地也陷入混乱：&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;长江流域的石家河与良渚，城池纷纷毁弃，疆域急剧收缩。到3800年前，原来的核心地带几乎变成了无人区。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;西辽河流域的众多聚落更是完全消失，人口直接被换种：基因检测发现，当地后来兴起的夏家店下层文化，与之前的居民没有遗传联系。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;而黄河流域同样是哀鸿遍野：考古显示黄河中下游的聚落数量，在这场浩劫中减少了将近90%，人口可能只剩原来的1/10。精致灿烂的龙山黑陶从此消失，直到一百多年后才出现一种非常粗糙的灰陶文化——这意味着原来的文明，原来的知识和技术传承，也在这场浩劫中损失殆尽。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;至于这场浩劫的由来，最常见的假说是大洪水：有学者根据考古证据，推测距今约3920年，黄河上游曾形成一个面积巨大的堰塞湖，堵塞黄河近9个月。之后堰塞湖溃堤，约160亿立方米的湖水瞬间倾泻而下，大洪水几乎荡平了整个黄河流域。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;该假说虽有一定道理，却无法解释同时期长江流域也发生了大崩溃——实际上，不仅是黄河长江，当时全世界都发生了文明大崩溃，这显然是一次波及全球的气候灾难：&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;中亚森林和撒哈拉湖泊消失，大沙漠从此诞生；北非尼罗河流域，兴盛了五百年的早王朝戛然而止，严重旱灾导致农业崩溃，埃及陷入长达百年的饥荒与内乱，史称“第一次中间期”；西亚两河流域，首度完成统一的阿卡德帝国，出现大量农田抛荒，随即被外来蛮族攻灭；在中欧和北欧，降温让气候变得寒冷潮湿，导致了众多族群的大迁徙……&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这次气候大灾变，如今被称为“4.2千年事件”，是一场堪称文明末日的天劫。洋流紊乱、超级火山爆发和厄尔尼诺现象叠加，可能是导致这次天灾的罪魁祸首。 4.2千年事件在不同地区表现不同，有的地方是大旱，有的地方是洪水，但总体来说都发生了大降温——实际上，这是自“新仙女木小冰期”结束后一直到今天，人类遭受过的最剧烈的一次降温。很多地方的气温，再也没能恢复到全新世大暖期的水平，舒适温暖的美好时光一去不返了。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;很显然，正是4.2千年事件，灭绝了西辽河先民，重创了黄河古城邦，也摧毁了长江流域的两个古老王朝。农业崩溃，饥荒横行，哀鸿遍野。短短数十年甚至数年间，就丧失了90%的人口，这是我们今人无法想象的末日景象。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;而华南的少数幸存者，即长江古农夫及其后裔，不得不带上稻种，四处逃荒，寻找勉强还能耕种的新土地。他们渡海向东抵达了朝鲜半岛和日本，成为韩国人和日本渡来人的祖先；向南抵达了菲律宾，成为南岛人征服太平洋的第一站；向西穿过云贵高原，抵达中南半岛和印度，与当地的猎人土著，融合出孟-高棉语系（南亚语系）……&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;正所谓祸福相倚，末日天劫中也孕育了新生。大灾过后，华夏从此告别“满天星斗”，开始走向一体：逃荒的华南先民（长江古农夫），还有一支抵达了北方中原。他们在这里碰到了同样逃荒至此的黄河古农夫。二者融合交流，共建新家园——河南二里头所在的嵩山南北地区，在全新世大暖期并不突出，只有一些零星的小聚落。然而大崩溃后数百年，大概是各地逃难的先民汇集于此，这里迅速复兴成长。距今约3800年前，二里头已发展成整个黄河流域的最大聚落，成为无可争议的中原之主。它旋即开始大肆扩张，很快成为整个东亚都无可匹敌的强盛王朝——很多学者相信，它就是古籍中的夏朝，华夏一统的时代来临了。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 22 Sep 2023 16:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[凉山警方破获特大贩运毒品案，缴获各类毒品146千克、抓捕31人]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257324]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-22 15:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;span>;在全国公安机关夏季治安打击整治行动中，凉山公安围绕夏日社会治安规律特点，聚焦本地突出违法犯罪行为，以“砺剑”行动为抓手，强化打击整治力度，抓实专项工作举措，有力守护人民生活安宁，维护社会治安大局稳定。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/22/5e015de2df5bfed8a0005a8fd8d1b0e2.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;677&quot; height=&quot;466&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/22/5e015de2df5bfed8a0005a8fd8d1b0e2.png&quot; data-key=&quot;251585&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;9月20日，凉山州公安局举行夏季治安打击整治行动暨“砺剑”行动新闻通气会，集中通报行动成果及典型案例。凉山州公安局党委副书记、常务副局长赵鹏出席会议并通报总体工作成效。凉山州公安局党&lt;/span>;委委员、政治部主任余星主持通气会。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;行动部署以来，全州公安机关共开展14次集中清查，累计出动警力4.8万余名，有效推动“砺剑”行动取得了“两降三升”（电信网络诈骗、盗窃类案件发案率下降，打击涉毒、涉黄、涉赌案件数上升）的工作成效。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;打击毒品违法犯罪。截止8月，破112案，打处149人，行政拘留139人，强戒数42人。 8月31日成功破获“2022.10.12”特大贩运毒品案，全案共抓获犯罪嫌疑人31人、累计缴获各类毒品146千克、毒资80余万元，为今年全省缴毒量最大、打掉涉毒网络最完整的涉滇涉缅毒品案件。 &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;打击电信网络诈骗。 3月1日至8月31日，全州共发生电信网络诈骗案件537件；破案325件；抓获950人；损失7180.64万余元；追赃挽损221.8243万元，坚持电诈案件“防为先”，州“反诈中心”日均预警3228余人次，止付涉案账户9958个，止付资金2.11亿余元，冻结涉案账户1242个，冻结资金4556.35万余元。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;打击盗窃类违法犯罪。全州共发生盗窃类案件824起，全州共破获盗窃类案件314件；抓获犯罪嫌疑人680人，打处543人。成功侦破“华能布拖拖觉风电项目主体工程机位电缆线被盗案”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;打击涉网违法犯罪。网络谣言打击率达100%；稳妥处置重大敏感舆情137起，涉凉负面舆情与去年同期相比下降30％。截至8月，破24案，打处27人。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;打击涉黄违法犯罪。全州公安机关坚持将“扫黄行动”作为首要打击整治任务，截止目前，共办理涉黄案件636起（行政527起、刑事109起），打处787人（行政651人、刑事136人）。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;打击赌博违法犯罪。截至8月，破838案，打处2882人，侦破木里“张某某等人聚众赌博案”刑事拘留19人，查处32名参赌人员，查获涉赌资金6万余元；打掉雷波“2023.8.11聚众赌博案”刑事拘留32人，涉案金额20余万元；联合法检两院，顺利起诉案件15起。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;挂牌整治方面。 2023年4月凉山州公安局首批次面向社会公开悬赏通缉50名网上在逃人员，已归案42名。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 22 Sep 2023 15:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[白客：像水一样的演员]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256804]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-22 14:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font -family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;Most of the time, Baike doesn&#39;t know where the boundaries of his abilities are and relies on his feelings.

Thank them.&quot; And he quietly does his job as an actor, using his skills, emotions, and talents to be responsible for every performance. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/vsBMgnmHeYijo0WGszOvBYMoRoFft3vyR6cl1cIK.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 720&quot; height=&quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/vsBMgnmHeYijo0WGszOvBYMoRoFft3vyR6cl1cIK.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250534&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(provided by interviewee/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font -family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;For related reports, please see &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.infzm.com/contents/254252&quot; title=&quot;Baike: A &quot;cowarded and frustrated&quot; &quot;The actor&#39;s way of survival&quot;>;Bake: The way of survival of a &quot;cowardly and frustrated&quot; actor&lt;/a>;&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On June 9, 2023, the Shanghai International Film Festival opened On the red carpet, actor Bai Ke appeared three times. In the screenings that lasted for 10 days, he was Gan Yaozu in &quot;Looking for Her&quot; and &quot;The Annual Party Can&#39;t Stop!&quot; &quot;Ma Jie&quot; and Pan Congcong in &quot;It&#39;s Worth It&quot;, whether he is the protagonist or supporting role, comedy or drama, he has appropriately expressed the character. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For Baike, becoming an actor was unexpected. On the eve of his graduation from college, he became famous for his dubbing work. In 2010, after graduating from Nanguang College of Communication University of China, he briefly worked in a television station, and then quickly went north to join the film and television company Wanhetianyi. When the company was on the verge of collapse and everyone was planning to go their separate ways, they filmed the short play &quot;Unexpectedly&quot;, which saved the company and made the director and actors an instant hit. The male protagonist of &quot;Unexpectedly&quot;, the narcissistic, self-deprecating, grassroots Wang Dachui, was played by Bai Gugu. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The experience of becoming popular in his early years was intertwined with the family teaching of &quot;live your own little life&quot;, and finally derived a happy-go-lucky character. He has his own comfort zone and feels good staying there. After work, I play football with my friends, watch football, read comics and TV shows, and spend time with my parents. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The only time he experienced stepping out of his comfort zone since he was a child was when he decided to apply for the broadcasting major because he liked football and wanted to be a football commentator. After studying media for four years, although he failed to become a commentator, he became sensitive to the matter of &quot;recording&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is also related to this that Baike liked the script of &quot;Looking for Her&quot;, a female self-awareness exploration in a traditional village. He said: &quot;This kind of thing is very meaningful to me. I think the topic needs to be recorded.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The filming of &quot;Looking for Her&quot; was not easy for Baike because he had to memorize Cantonese lines and play opposite Shu Qi. There was a scene where he and Shu Qi quarreled, and there was a lot of Cantonese dialogue, which was originally going to be filmed after the actors got used to each other. However, the crew encountered a typhoon as soon as they arrived in Huizhou, the filming location. In order to avoid the bad weather, director Chen Shizhong planned to shoot the quarrel scene indoors first. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;He would not say that I was scared before the shooting, nor would he say that I would definitely be able to do it, and then he would complete it very well. He is very relaxed, but has strong energy inside.&quot; Later Chen Shizhong said Then I realized that Bai Ke was nervous, but he hid it. Chen Shizhong had seen a journalist role he played, and on the day after watching it, he posted on WeChat Moments: Bai Ke can give the director a great sense of security. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;He is an actor like water. He can be matched with any actor. He is very malleable.&quot; Chen Shizhong said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 22 Sep 2023 14:55:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[杭州亚运会主媒体中心里有什么？南周记者带你去探营]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257322]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-22 13:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 22 Sep 2023 13:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[张家界一景区多名身着警察制服人员殴打游客？警方回应]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257326]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-22 12:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;&lt;span>;Police Information Report&lt;/span>; &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;At 12:49 on September 20, 2023, the Yongding Public Security Bureau received a call from a tourist claiming to have been injured.

It first premiered on August 4 with 4 episodes, and then stopped airing the next day due to &quot;media reasons&quot;, setting a record for the &quot;fastest offline&quot; of a domestic drama. It did not resume broadcast until September 6, dispelling the audience&#39;s doubts that it disappeared out of thin air. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/21/5a25a4a369827783352e693c7158d38e.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;1620&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/21/5a25a4a369827783352e693c7158d38e.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;251571&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;The Stranger&quot; &quot;Under&quot; is adapted from the well-known Chinese comic &quot;Under One Person&quot; created by Mi Er. The original work is not only well-received but also extremely popular. Since the animated version came out in 2016, it has been broadcast for a total of five seasons, with an average score of 8.4 on Douban. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;qi (qi) warrior&quot; in traditional fairy tale novels was fictionalized by Mi Er into a &quot;stranger&quot; hidden in the real world in the original work. &quot;Extraordinary people&quot; are gifted with special abilities and can skillfully control their own &quot;qi&quot;, thus possessing special abilities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is said that during the Jiashen period (1944), several strangers discovered the &quot;Eight Wonderful Skills&quot; such as the Origin of Qi Ti, Ju Ling Qian Jiang, Fenghou Qimen, and the Tongtian Rui, which caused the strangers to People in the world fought for it, which triggered a bloody storm, known in history as the &quot;Jiashen Rebellion.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/21/0c12eb18e51067c31c3f414d93f0f34f.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;638&quot; height= &quot;270&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/21/0c12eb18e51067c31c3f414d93f0f34f.png&quot; data-key=&quot;251573&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The comic is adapted into Dramas have a natural barrier, which is mainly reflected in the degree of casting and adaptation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Similar to the live-action version of &quot;One Piece&quot;, &quot;Under the Stranger&quot; also experienced a difficult casting controversy when it first aired. Zhang Chulan, played by Peng Yuchang, was questioned for her poor appearance and lacked the ruffian spirit in the original work; Feng Baobao, played by Wang Yinglu, was questioned for her dull acting skills, like a humanoid AI; Zhang Lingyu, played by Bi Wenjun, had inconsistent appearance and temperament , was criticized. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/21/3e397c0a9ab9647b08e98a436e959af9.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;736&quot; height= &quot;308&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/21/3e397c0a9ab9647b08e98a436e959af9.png&quot; data-key=&quot;251570&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although these doubts It&#39;s not unreasonable, but it&#39;s also common for people to have difficulty in choosing the right characters for comic book adaptations. Since the audience watches the original work first, they are bound to have preconceptions and view the comic-adapted drama with resistance. When the domestic comic drama &quot;Soul of Chess&quot; came out, it was labeled as &quot;ruining childhood&quot; due to casting and styling issues. It was not until the story got better in the later years that the reputation changed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/21/36a6d71ccad0a47b673eee745a80a5f7.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;450&quot; ​​data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/21/36a6d71ccad0a47b673eee745a80a5f7.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;251572&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Therefore, select Whether the corner sticks to the face or not is very important, but one move will not determine life or death. Because there is still a plot, and a good storyline can also turn the tide. And this involves the &quot;degree&quot; of adaptation: too few adaptations, and it is suspected of copying and pasting; too many adaptations, and the characters and famous scenes are not restored enough, and it is easy to fall into the misunderstanding of &quot;magic modification&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the comic drama &quot;Under the Stranger&quot;, the male protagonist Zhang Chulan accidentally got involved in the world of strangers because his grandfather Zhang Huaiyi&#39;s bones were stolen. In the process of searching for his grandfather&#39;s body, he first met Feng Baobao, a girl who behaved strangely, and then was recruited by the mysterious organization Nadu Tong. He passed the trial of the Tianshi Mansion in Longhu Mountain and got the opportunity to participate in the Alien Martial Arts Competition. Opportunity...&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As the descendant of the &quot;Eight Skills&quot; Qi Ti lineage, Zhang Chulan quickly became a popular star in the alien world, attracting the attention of all forces. In the process of wrestling with various forces, he gradually came to face the various alien abilities that his grandfather had taught him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/21/e74900efbaca076c702130cdaa78d40b.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;727&quot; height= &quot;311&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/21/e74900efbaca076c702130cdaa78d40b.png&quot; data-key=&quot;251574&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Original author Mi Secondly, &quot;Under the Stranger&quot; has restored the rich world view constructed with imaginative settings to a greater extent, including various sects, families and stunts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Disguised as a logistics company, &quot;Everywhere Connect&quot; has employees who are all composed of aliens. They are responsible for maintaining the balance and stability of the alien world and ensuring that ordinary people will not be aware of the existence of aliens. It is a bit like a cartoon. S.H.I.E.L.D. in the Marvel Universe. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the alien world, the ten men with the highest say are from the Tianshi Mansion, the Lu Family, the Lu Family, the Tianxiahui, the Wang Family, the Mu Family, and the Chen Family. Zhang Zhiwei, the Celestial Master of Longhu Mountain, is the leader of the ten men. He has a very high level of cultivation and is over a hundred years old. He is the ceiling of combat power in the alien world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/21/bb791c56359d86ea510d67e0cf69b036.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;720&quot; height= &quot;302&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/21/bb791c56359d86ea510d67e0cf69b036.png&quot; data-key=&quot;251575&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Don&#39;t talk about it &quot;Quan Xing&quot;, who has no principles and no rules, is an alien organization that does all kinds of evil. &quot;Complete nature&quot; has been around for thousands of years. It was founded by Yang Zhu, one of the hundreds of scholars in the Warring States period. It originally emphasized &quot;preserving integrity and not burdening the body with things&quot;. Unfortunately, it gradually went astray in the later period and became an evil spirit in the alien world. group. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Judging from the number of episodes currently aired, the overall quality of &quot;Under the Strangers&quot; is still good. First of all, director Xu Hongyu set a clear main line for the whole play, changing the unit-style narrative habit of the original work, using the male protagonist Zhang Chulan as the entry point, allowing him to lead the audience into the world of strangers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Secondly, as the plot progresses, several suspense points in the original work become clear and intriguing, such as the reasons for the &quot;Jiashen Rebellion&quot; and the mystery of Feng Baobao&#39;s life experience. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Furthermore, in addition to restoring the characters and famous scenes, the main creator also showed good subjective initiative, such as rationalizing the popular character Wang Ye in advance. Under the interpretation of actor Hou Minghao, this The charm of the character continues in the play. Many viewers said that they came for the comic adaptation and eventually became fans of Wang Ye. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Finally, the entire plot is dense and fast-paced. The plot has advanced to the 20th episode, and the content of the first two seasons and extra chapters of the animated version has been completed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/21/e1f0d2c3443b5dc9a4c30ec286e96262.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;455&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/21/e1f0d2c3443b5dc9a4c30ec286e96262.png&quot; data-key=&quot;251577&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From the core idea It seems that &quot;Under the Stranger&quot; has firmly captured the essence of the original work, that is, &quot;What is a Stranger&quot;. Mi Er once mentioned in an interview that this story began with the word &quot;foreigner&quot;. He wanted to express the theme of &quot;if one day you find that you are different from others, how should you deal with yourself and how should you get along with the world?&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Everyone will encounter such torture when growing up. Some people choose to stick to themselves, while others choose to blend in with others. There is no right or wrong way to do this. No matter what choice you make, the ultimate goal is to find your own place in this world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/21/cba1cf717be21996e7db64fffed47ee5.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;789&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/21/cba1cf717be21996e7db64fffed47ee5.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;251576&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot; Stranger &quot;The word itself has two meanings, one is a person with special powers, and the other is a rejected alien. The male protagonist Zhang Chulan happens to possess these two characteristics. But what he yearned for wholeheartedly was to be an ordinary person and live an ordinary life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For this reason, he endured it for 12 years, in order not to expose his strength and to survive. But the tree wanted to be still but the wind didn&#39;t stop. The more he wanted to be calm, the more he couldn&#39;t be calm. When things finally came to a head, he gave up his patience and began to explore the truth about the alien world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/21/e75c9fa1134fb62283f569f81e90c661.gif&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;597&quot; height= &quot;248&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/21/e75c9fa1134fb62283f569f81e90c661.gif&quot; data-key=&quot;251578&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If you say before In 22 years, being a stranger but being willing to be ordinary is a kind of strength. After that, it is another kind of strength to face one&#39;s own abilities and choose to live a life with dignity and confidence. What the play emphasizes is not &quot;strangers&quot;, but &quot;people&quot; - people&#39;s choices, people&#39;s confrontation with fate, and people&#39;s pursuit of the truth. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In short, this is not an impeccable drama. If you are repulsive to the &quot;secondary sense&quot; itself, you will probably accept incompetence. But if you like this style and the passion of teenagers, then it will most likely provide you with happiness. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 22 Sep 2023 11:25:03 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
