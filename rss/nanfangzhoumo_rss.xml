The 38-year-old writer Sonam Cairang&#39;s figure is not considered tall and majestic among herdsmen. After leaving the bright clothes and running pastures, walking in the crowded city, even the slightly laborious raised tongue reveals a reserved and bookish tone. He habitually put on a polite, courteous, and gentlemanly face, and sat down at the dining table, reminding himself that there wasn&#39;t much red wine in the glass, but he still had to take a sip first. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Having just left his hometown in his twenties, the outside world’s default behavior of standing at the wine table for a toast and saying a bunch of toast words made him at a loss. He followed the example in panic for a while, and then lied that he never drank. When he returned to the grassland, he relieved his psychological burden and started drinking. The rule in the pastoral area is that no matter how hospitable the other party is, no one will stand up and thank the host with a glass of wine and say that I will return the invitation next time; nor will the other party be offended just because he said the wrong thing. In no particular order, everyone started making fists after having two or three glasses of wine, &quot;It&#39;s much simpler, especially direct and rough.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;People living in grasslands, especially in alpine areas, can&#39;t be said to be indifferent in their emotions. In short, they are not that Rich.&quot; When grazing, it is common to go two or three days without seeing anyone to communicate or talk. The longest time, judging from Suonan Cairang&#39;s personal record, this silence lasted forty or fifty days. He was talking to himself in a desolate and vast environment, and he had developed a distant and overlooking gaze, making it difficult for him to be sentimental. &quot;Man develops this kind of character in an interdependent relationship with the environment. His attitude towards living creatures is different and more ruthless.&quot; Livestock fed by hand can be a tool for herders to travel far, or a Food to go with alcohol. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Sonam Cairang’s short story collection &quot;Looking for Signals&quot; published in 2023, these animals have also become the real murderers that drive the plot. During a dialogue at the Shanghai Book Fair in August, guest Han Songluo deliberately counted the ways of death that appeared in the book in advance, and recited at the scene in a tone like a bill report, &quot;One death from freezing, one sudden death, two deaths from being run over by a cow.&quot; times, and once fell from a horse to death...&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Compare the &quot;modern ways&quot; of death in Alice Munro&#39;s writings about those who fled the town, such as plane and train crashes, cancer, shipwrecks and drowning, etc. , Han Songluo classified the passages in Suonan Cai&#39;s book in which he sacrificed his life to contend with nature or interact with animals as &quot;pre-modern&quot;. The author explained that this is indeed an environmental test that plateau herders face every day. &quot;There are often floods and lightning in Qinghai. People are struck to death by lightning, thrown to death by horses, and various accidents occur.&quot; Han Songluo With emotion, &quot;I thought we were very far away from pre-modern society, but Sonam&#39;s words bring us back to this scene, where the relationship between humans, animals, land, and death is still maintained by instinct.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yes. The conversation took place in the Miguel de Cervantes Library, next door to the fashionable Julu Road. Some viewers in the audience did not buy it and raised questions, saying that in such an environment, &quot;it is completely impossible to think of the grassland.&quot; , and also didn’t understand, “What does it mean to tell stories about the past?”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Suonan Cairang still responded in a low voice, “There is a lag in writing. What you feel at the moment cannot immediately become a work. After Only through precipitation and fermentation can we write about the grazing experience passed down from our fathers.&quot; As for whether it can convey a strong sense of foreignness, this is actually an important clue for Suonan Cairang&#39;s writing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;His novel collection &quot;In the Wasteland&quot; published in 2021 was once spotted by director Wanma Caidan, and his new work &quot;Looking for Signal&quot; was also shortlisted for the 7th Pingyao International Film Festival in October 2023. &quot;Migration Plan·From Literature to Film and Television&quot; section - the story must exude a completely different temperament from the city, which is why directors have successively purchased the copyright and tried to adapt it; but this kind of northwest ranch style is not the focus of his text, as the final A generation of nomads, he shouldered personal experiences, the memories of his father&#39;s generation, and the collision of life when he went out to work as an adult. After a few years, he returned to his hometown with mixed eyes. Therefore, he was never satisfied with recording the strange scenery on the surface, but stood in the Explore the spiritual changes of herdsmen from a broader perspective - facing the expansion of urbanization undoubtedly reveals more and more consistent ways of living and thinking, making readers unable to feel the &quot;grassland&quot; coming towards them. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2008, he came to Beijing with 300 yuan in his pocket and worked in a factory that made urban sculptures. Before entering the factory, he bought two volumes of the Nobel Prize in Literature collection, as well as a collection of works that cost more than 100 yuan. A biography of Faulkner that cost almost half of his net worth. One time I didn&#39;t go back to my hometown during the Spring Festival. I was watching fireworks alone in an empty factory. I suddenly felt a force, as if Qinghai Lake was close in front of me. I pushed open the invisible door of my home. My father, who had drunk too much the day before, was lying on the sofa with his hat on. sleep. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“My hometown is the bloodline of my writing. Later I started to doubt it, and the thread of pulling became weaker and weaker. Only after I leave can I write about my hometown and understand it.” Now there are no sheep left in his family, and there are about 80 of them. The cattle are usually taken care of by his younger brother, and he returns to the ranch once a month. In order to maintain his creative state, he lives in Haiyan County, not far from the ranch, and retains some urban living habits. When he gets up every day, he jogs, makes coffee, eats eggs, and then reads a book for a while. After 8 o&#39;clock, Go to the studio and start writing for the day. When I write seven to eight hundred words a day, I no longer want to write, so I go do something else. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The editor of the new book once concluded, &quot;Most of his novels are about stories about alpine grassland pastoral areas, but they do not make readers feel distant.&quot; The reason is Liu Xiaolin, vice chairman of the Qinghai Provincial Writers Association and a critic. After some analysis, &quot;he did not deliberately highlight the nationality and regional customs, lacked the quiet, simple and melodious pastoral mood of ordinary prairie novels, and did not examine the nationality in the binary opposition between the world and the local, tradition and modernity.&quot; The past and the future, and he has no intention of turning the novel into a national allegory. The usual thinking in the writing of these national literatures does not seem to affect him at all. He prefers to adopt a cold and calm narrative, focusing on the secular life of the grassland. , daily life such as grazing, drinking, and falling in love, showing the increasingly chaotic living conditions and life forms of the grasslands under the impact of modern civilization.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/ cms/medias/image/23/11/01/l2VGmDF1AHXwd1npPJEKUFA3j1fCJQZKAIjXoWV6.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;546&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/ 23/11/01/l2VGmDF1AHXwd1npPJEKUFA3j1fCJQZKAIjXoWV6.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256523&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Suonan Cairang’s own ranch&lt;span style= &quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(provided by interviewee/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The last generation of nomads in their hometown&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Suonan Cairang:&lt;/ strong>;&lt;span>;I especially like watching movies. Hong Kong police and gangster movies and TVB costume martial arts movies have been with me growing up. Every year except winter, there is a mobile tent video hall on the grassland. It is very popular. At night, the speakers start playing videos to attract customers. Grasslands are different from cities. The sound penetration is particularly strong and can be heard within a radius of more than ten kilometers. When we heard it, we felt so itchy that we couldn&#39;t sit still at home. We immediately ran to a heavily trafficked three-way intersection a few kilometers away and got into a mobile tent set up on the roadside. The chairs take up space, so in order to seat as many people as possible, everyone sits cross-legged, not even able to stretch their legs. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before going to school, my uncle was a movie projectionist on the grassland. I sat on his carriage and followed him to more than a dozen villages to enlarge the film. When I dropped out of school at the age of 12 and returned to the ranch, I started watching in mobile tents until I was in my twenties. At first it was VCD, then DVD, and the price rose from 50 cents to one dollar. The shows are different every day, not just Hong Kong films, but also some classic films from the Mainland, as well as foreign films like &quot;Gone with the Wind.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 凯体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Sounds like a wonderful teenage period. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Sonam Cairang:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;The only thing I have not regretted until now is leaving school. At that time, conditions did not allow (study). My family was in a pastoral area. If I wanted to study, I had to go to the county town. The winter pasture was 40 kilometers away, and the summer pasture was 70 or 80 kilometers away. There was no boarding school in the county, so I had to stay with relatives, and there was no one to take care of me. In addition, I couldn’t read it myself, and my family was very happy when I stopped reading, because I needed help. Looking back later, I probably gained more outside of school than in school. I didn’t study in school. I only studied after I came out. Going to school and studying are two different things. School is about learning, not reading. The first book I came into contact with was &quot;Dragon and the Eight Parts&quot;. I took that book to herd sheep. It was winter, and it was a day full of yellow sand, but I had no time to pay attention to other things all day long. I don’t even know where my flock is. That was the beginning of my real reading. As for movies, I probably watched thousands of them in those years. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;These movies will be helpful for you to write novels in the future Impact? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Sonam Cairang:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I think a big part of my writing is film, whether it is narration or observing the dialogue of characters. Or in terms of demeanor, it will definitely have an impact in a subtle way. Because when I watch a movie, I will be particularly immersed in it. I will remember the lines in a good movie. I can even imitate the expression, intonation, and speed of each character when they say those lines. The scene environment will also be in my mind. vivid in my mind. I really long for that kind of ability right now. If I&#39;m watching a movie and you&#39;re talking to me next to me, I won&#39;t hear you at all. Although this habit has not been completely lost, I still cannot concentrate as before, including reading. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Watching a movie in a mobile tent saw Twenty How old were you? Did you have a TV at home at that time? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Sonam Cairang:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Electricity was introduced to our home in 2008. I was 23 years old. I was already married by that time, and tent movies were slowly disappearing. The boom is booming. After the advent of solar energy, many herdsmen bought a small black and white TV, a VCD, two large solar chargers and a battery to watch at home, as did my family. I often see that the battery is depleted. The electricity is used for winter pastures and settlements. Where other nomadic sites have electricity, it is still powered. Anyway, the tent movie still managed to survive for seven or eight years before it was completely gone. Later, everyone had mobile phones. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Do you think the current life in the pastoral areas is different from that in the city? Is the gap still big? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Sonam Cairang:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;There is basically no difference. There is actually no difference after having a mobile phone. There is no lag in the flow of information between cities and pastoral areas. When you get such important information, it will pop up on our mobile phones immediately, but the focus is different. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;A lot of things happened in the lives of the herdsmen. Big change? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Sonam Cairang:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Yes, especially the impact on the younger generation is a complete transformation. Our parents have always been in a nomadic sequence. When they got older and were succeeded by our generation, their lifestyles changed like a fault. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Nearby farmers will come to the pastoral areas to build houses and do some temporary work during their spare time. Without exception, they will envy us. Because they saw that all the men, young and old, looked very leisurely. The older ones drank, rode horses, walked around, drove sheep back and forth all day long; the younger ones either played or played billiards every day. Watch movies and fall in love. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Is it still possible for teenagers to go herding now? No, they all went to study, and the perceptions of all the herdsmen changed. I used to not think that studying was the only way out, or the best prerequisite for the future of life, but now I do so. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;But you didn&#39;t take that road either. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Suonan Cairang:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Many of our group have not left, so our generation is the last nomad, and there will not be many in the next generation. Individuals will become truly nomadic, and nomadism is shrinking. This shrinkage is not only determined by ourselves, but also due to the adjustment of ecological policies. Qinghai is an important protected area. Everything is based on protecting the ecology and providing a good cycle, so grazing is not encouraged. There are many restrictions. For example, you cannot raise too many cattle and sheep. It depends on the carrying capacity of the pasture. If you have a thousand acres of pasture, you can only raise two to three hundred sheep. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/yYMPeuFO6Ju7Wkz3NVTlS0taekLSKwGzQf6SdUMh.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 683&quot; height=&quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/yYMPeuFO6Ju7Wkz3NVTlS0taekLSKwGzQf6SdUMh.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256519&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4 >;Both roughness and delicacy are the truth on the grassland&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 凯体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Looking back now , do you think not going to school is a good choice? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Sonam Cairang:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I don’t think my daughter can persist on this road for so long. That is unrealistic. It&#39;s an individual case and requires a little bit of talent. Sometimes I still can’t imagine it—how could I become a writer inexplicably? If I weren&#39;t a writer, I would definitely be in business or doing something else. I think it&#39;s boring to stay in the same environment all the time. I always want to change my way of life. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You now go to the county studio every day , the range of activity seems to be smaller. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Suonan Cairang:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Wouldn’t my own spiritual space be larger? I also often go to the pastoral area, which is very close. I usually just go for a walk and do nothing. Sometimes I go to see friends to have fun or help relatives. There are also houses over there, and sheep and cowsheds are ready-made. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Similar to &quot;Invite a Cow to Eat&quot; Is the story something you heard, or is it based on something that happened in your bullpen? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Sonam Cairang: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;It is a fictional story conceived from a very small point. There is a big pot at the door of our house, filled with various vegetable leaves and leftover rice. Every night when the yaks return to their pen, one or two will come to eat. The two of them occupied that place. When other cows came, they would attack with their horns. After a few times, the others stopped coming. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Electricity was already available at that time. The wires connected from the old house to the new house were too long, and a pole was erected in the middle. One day, the two of them stopped eating, and they were The lingering, vibrating sound burst out of the chest like a vent, breaking the pole. I was so angry that the power pole fell down. Although no one was hurt, it caused me a lot of losses. The wires were torn off on both sides and all the insurance was burned out. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When they are making trouble, they consciously know not to harm their owners, so they do not knock on the door or break in. Do you know what annoyed us most before? In summer and autumn, when it is almost dawn, at four or five o&#39;clock in the morning, the cows will eat slowly until they come to the tent. Because people move around and pour some water, there is salt in that area. You can&#39;t even drive them away. You can only take two or three steps outside. After a while, they come back and eat the tent&#39;s canvas edges, chewing them until you can sleep. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/bbhbALOhJpzgz4f89UXuCgxQvoW2yviZp3xM87IA.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;617&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/bbhbALOhJpzgz4f89UXuCgxQvoW2yviZp3xM87IA.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256517&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt; strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Will herdsmen become more patient as a result?

It&#39;s impossible to write two or three books and still be like this and still talk about it and think it&#39;s self-righteous. After reading too much and writing too much, &quot;Looking for Signals&quot; is the product of this awareness. You can see that the novella &quot;Portraits of Saints and Ivory Mahjong&quot; is different from &quot;In the Wasteland&quot;.

So far, my country&#39;s world irrigation engineering heritage has reached 34. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The reporter learned from the Ministry of Water Resources that the tenth batch of the World Irrigation Engineering Heritage List was announced at the 74th Executive Council of the International Commission on Irrigation and Drainage held in Visakhapatnam, India. Chen Mingzhong, chairman of China&#39;s National Irrigation and Drainage Commission and director of the Department of Rural Water Resources and Hydropower of the Ministry of Water Resources, said that my country&#39;s world irrigation engineering heritage covers almost all types of irrigation projects. It is the most abundant type of irrigation engineering heritage, the most widely distributed, and the most outstanding irrigation benefits. nation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Qimenyan Irrigation System is located in Shucheng County, Anhui Province. It was first established in the Western Han Dynasty. It uses the form of wetlands to &quot;form canals and ponds for storage&quot; and has played an important role for more than two thousand years. It plays an important role in irrigation, flood control and drought prevention. It currently irrigates 200,000 acres of farmland. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Hongze Ancient Irrigation Area is located in Hongze District, Huai&#39;an City, Jiangsu Province. It is a water storage irrigation area and consists of water storage, water intake, water transportation and drainage projects. Since the Eastern Han Dynasty, ancient people have diverted water for irrigation and farming. Water conservancy facilities have been built in the past dynasties, and the irrigation area continues to this day. Currently, the irrigation area controlled by the irrigation district is 481,300 acres. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Huoquan Irrigation Project is located in Hongdong County, Shanxi Province. It has been clearly recorded since the Zhenguan period of the Tang Dynasty, and it still plays a role in irrigation, water supply, ecology, tourism and other functions. At present, the total irrigation area of ​​the project is 101,000 acres. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Baini Ancient Weir is located in Chongyang County, Hubei Province, and includes two ancient weirs, Shijian Weir and Yuanpi Weir.

Visual China/Photo&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On August 25, 2023, the State Council executive meeting reviewed and approved the &quot;Guiding Opinions on the Planning and Construction of Affordable Housing.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A real estate expert involved in system design confirmed to Southern Weekend reporters that the &quot;Guidance on Planning and Construction of Affordable Housing&quot; (Guofa [2023] No. 14) (hereinafter referred to as No. 14) was It was distributed to various cities at the end of August, mainly targeting megacities with a net inflow of population and cities with a permanent population of more than 3 million in built-up areas, a total of 35 cities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Document No. 14 clarifies two major goals. The first is to increase the construction and supply of affordable housing, &quot;allowing working-income groups to gradually realize home ownership&quot;; the second is to promote the establishment of a new model of transformation and development of the real estate industry, return commercial housing to commodity attributes, meet the demand for improved housing, and promote stability. Land prices, stabilizing housing prices, and stabilizing expectations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Not only is affordable housing highly valued, its relationship positioning and development model with commercial housing have also been further clarified. Some people believe that this is a &quot;new round of housing reform&quot; similar to the Singapore model. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“Reform is gradual and forced”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;According to the above-mentioned experts, a major focus of Document No. 14 is to launch allotment-type affordable housing. China has previously established a housing security system that integrates public rental housing, affordable rental housing, and shared property housing. The new allotment-type affordable housing will be connected with it to form an affordable housing system parallel to commercial housing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Yujia, chief researcher of the Housing Policy Research Center of the Guangdong Provincial Institute of Urban Planning, told Southern Weekend reporters that currently affordable housing accounts for 20%-30% of the existing housing stock, mainly for people with urban household registration, such as minimum living allowance and low-income families. Income groups, coverage is limited. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;With the changes in the population structure and the increase in housing prices, new citizens, young people and other groups are facing severe housing difficulties, and the contradiction between the scope of housing security and actual needs has become increasingly prominent. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“There are 300-400 million new citizens and migrant population in the country, and most of them do not have houses. The anxiety about owning property rights houses has risen to the level of class promotion.” Li Yujia once wrote an article. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, during the real estate boom period, commercial housing and land prices soared, and local governments were not very enthusiastic about investing in the construction of affordable housing. There is a big gap between affordable housing and commercial housing in terms of location, quality, and public services, making it difficult to truly meet needs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“If we do not vigorously build affordable housing, we must tolerate the existence of urban villages, factory dormitories and other informal housing that are free from urban public services.” Li Yujia believes that this has led to the The housing pattern shows a &quot;dual split&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In other words, commercial housing for middle and high incomes and informal housing for low and middle incomes dominate, with the middle form weak, and there is a ladder fault in housing consumption. In the &quot;first half&quot; of the real estate market, where urbanization is advancing rapidly, house prices are not high, and price increases are expected to be strong, this problem is not yet obvious. As real estate enters a downward period, the problem becomes more prominent. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since the end of 2021, measures to rescue the real estate market have continued. Various localities have successively relaxed loan restrictions and purchase restrictions, and introduced various policies to stimulate real estate consumption, but they have not had the same immediate effect as before. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Reform is gradual and forced. The time has come. Otherwise, real estate may face the risk of &#39;stalling&#39;.&quot; Li Yujia said. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The &quot;combination punch&quot; of supply-side reform&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The focus of Document No. 14 is the supply-side reform of real estate. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The above-mentioned experts who participated in the design of the No. 14 system said that the important problem caused by the past real estate development model was the mismatch between supply and demand. The leading idea of ​​​​the new round of housing reform no longer starts from the demand side, but adjusts the supply. Structure, planning and construction of affordable housing, that is, allotment-type affordable housing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The meaning is that it is built and sold by state-owned enterprises and supplied at cost price. The owner has complete property rights, but it can only be transferred in a closed manner. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some houses are for new construction, and the land is allocated and supplied. The construction entities are local state-owned enterprises and urban investment companies, and private enterprises are also encouraged to participate in agency construction. Funds come from special bonds, bank loans, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The above-mentioned experts analyzed that selling at cost will allow the investment in such affordable housing to be recovered and avoid increasing hidden debts. This also requires that this type of affordable housing must be able to be sold so that it can be built to order and provide effective supply. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Revitalizing stock is also an important means of raising funds. Document No. 14 clarifies that in cities with a large inventory of commercial housing, existing commercial housing can be appropriately renovated or purchased to be used as affordable housing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Document No. 14 also proposed that there is conditional support for the use of idle and inefficient industrial, commercial, office and other non-residential land to build affordable housing. If the land use is changed, the land price will not be paid back, and the original allocated land will continue to be retained. transfer method. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The above-mentioned experts believe that revitalizing the stock is more important. Because new land is limited in big cities, allocable land is concentrated in the periphery of the city, making it difficult to meet the needs of job-housing balance. And under the downward pressure on housing prices, these areas will be more obviously affected, and the affordable housing constructed may not be popular. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, real estate has entered the era of stock. Li Yujia introduced that it will take more than five years to digest the general inventory in many peripheral areas of cities. According to a survey by the Ministry of Land and Resources, 40% of the country’s existing land is idle or inefficiently used. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the plan of Document No. 14, this type of affordable housing is mainly aimed at working-income groups who have housing difficulties and low income, as well as groups such as imported talents needed by the city, and people who have been protected by the urban village transformation previously implemented The degree of overlap is high. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In July 2023, the State Council executive meeting reviewed and approved the &quot;Guiding Opinions on Actively and Steadily Promoting the Transformation of Urban Villages in Mega-Cities&quot;. On October 12, the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development disclosed that the urban village reconstruction information system has currently included 162 urban village reconstruction projects in the database, and the urban village reconstruction in super megacities is being implemented in three categories. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Yujia introduced that the renovation of urban villages is mainly aimed at affordable rental housing. It raises housing resources through demolition, reconstruction and inventory improvement. It is mainly to provide rental options for new citizens, young people, etc., and it is a rent-to-rent guarantee. house. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The combination of the allotment-type affordable housing planning in Document No. 14 and the transformation of urban villages has formed a &quot;combination&quot; of real estate supply-side reforms. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;The basic logic is that through government-led affordable housing, people with housing difficulties can enjoy urban public services and become citizens. Build &#39;rent before buy&#39;, &#39;small before big&#39;,&#39; &quot;Get on the bus first and then improve it,&quot; the housing asset ownership ladder will eventually become a property owner in the city.&quot; Li Yujia wrote in an article. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Challenges&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;However, whether the allotment-type affordable housing planned in Document No. 14 can achieve the expected results also faces challenges. One of the keys is closed circulation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As early as 1994, China promoted affordable housing and sold it to low- and middle-income groups at a price lower than commercial housing. However, because there were no closed circulation restrictions, many houses ended up being traded in the second-hand market, which not only created space for rent-seeking, but also gradually lost their protective role. Construction was no longer available in 2003. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to &quot;Xinhua News Agency&quot;, at the conference call on planning and construction of affordable housing work held on September 4, 2023, Vice Premier He Lifeng emphasized that affordable housing must implement strict closed management. Not allowed to be listed for trading. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The above-mentioned experts involved in system design said that this means that this type of affordable housing will have restrictions on property rights and stipulate a closed period of a certain number of years. During the period, it cannot be transferred and can only be repurchased by the government. After the closed period, it can only be transferred internally among groups that meet the guarantee conditions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another key issue is whether the existing land can be revitalized and high-quality land parcels can be truly produced. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The above-mentioned experts said that during the preparation process of affordable rental housing, attempts were made to revitalize existing land, but the results were not good. The reason is that the adjustment of land planning is restricted by the overall planning of the area, and whether the public facilities can be constructed after it is converted into residential buildings is also a big test. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Moreover, land is an important asset in the eyes of all economic entities. Some enterprises and institutions that occupy high-quality land are more inclined to provide housing benefits to insiders. Can they use the land to build affordable housing and provide housing to the whole world? Social cost price placement is also an issue. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Achieving home ownership through affordable housing will be helpful to the future development of the commercial housing market.” The above-mentioned experts believe that if the placement-type affordable housing planned in Document No. 14 can achieve the expected results, It will meet the housing purchase needs of new citizens, young people and other groups, and further solve the dilemma of demand gap and high inventory pressure in the real estate market. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 04 Nov 2023 21:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[逃不掉的，侯孝贤说]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259942]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-04 20:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 11/01/oIlWQzZZTDpZ7S7fGr5ibXWqXIxgFpINyhNeGd65.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;641&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/oIlWQzZZTDpZ7S7fGr5ibXWqXI xgFpINyhNeGd65. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256541&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If the &quot;New Wave of French Films&quot; produced two big figures, Godard and Truffaut, Taiwan&#39;s new films also have two heroes, one of whom is rooted in the soil. Hou Hsiao-hsien, and the other is Edward Yang, a programmer who returned from the United States. With a Western perspective, Edward Yang is good at capturing the urban feel, and his films are more genre-based. The urban feel of Taiwan at that time was a middle ground between rural and urban areas, and the unique flavor was very iconic in his shots. To this day, many aspects of society can still be seen in their movies. Speaking more broadly, if Edward Yang had not passed away prematurely, &quot;Taiwan&#39;s New Cinema&quot; would have had a different pattern. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Taiwan&#39;s new film begins with the 1982 platter film &quot;The Story of Time&quot;, which was screened across Taiwan. Among the co-directors was Edward Yang, who studied and worked in the United States and later returned to Taiwan to make movies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Director Hou Hsiao-hsien, who had already made three romance films that were very successful at the box office, joined the following year. He and two other directors made another platter movie &quot;My Son&#39;s Big Doll&quot; - —At this time, Hou Hsiao-hsien obviously hadn’t found himself yet. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When a filmmaker &quot;sees himself&quot;, to be more specific, it means that his attitude towards things and people can be reflected in the film, and he cannot deceive people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hou Hsiao-hsien&#39;s style first appeared in &quot;The Man From Fengkuei&quot; in 1983. A very modern emotional state, akin to melancholy and alienation, is evident when viewed from a distance. The lives of several confused young people are observed from a distance with fixed camera positions and long lenses. The camera suddenly gained an attitude, a bit pushing away the audience and asking everyone to calm down. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Previous Taiwanese movies were not like this. In the early 1970s, Taiwan was dominated by martial arts films and Qiong Yao-style romance films; in the late 1970s, many pornographic or violent films appeared. Business was not business, and rurality was not rural; by the 1980s, a generation of young Taiwanese people were facing The pull between Chinese traditional spirit and Western modern culture sways with the wind in life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/OdDvG7jpCBunuQg2L77akjJfKs0toKpp5rKL2M2Y.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/OdDvG7jpCBunuQg2L77akjJfKs0toKpp5rKL2M2Y.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256536&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hou Hsiao-Hsien Zeng said in an interview: &quot;A director can only make one movie. The method of attention can change, but the angle is the same... Edward Yang left Taiwan for the United States and came back after so many years. His memory compared with his current view. I grew up in the countryside in southern Taiwan. I read classical books. Natural growth and life are my vision...&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The concept of modernity in Hou Hsiao-hsien is mixed and rich, oriental Form, Eastern thinking, and the core point of view connects the West. At that time, he and several directors of the same age were discussing this matter, which attracted a lot of praise. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the best years of Taiwan&#39;s new films, the average annual film production could reach about 120. &quot;This film reform movement inspired by the new generation of film workers and film directors was short-lived in the 1980s. It has experienced ups and downs in a few years, and has reached a peak that is still unreachable for Taiwanese films, giving Taiwanese films a place in the history of world cinema.&quot; This is a summary of Taiwanese new films that I have read from a lot of information. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On January 24, 1987, the &quot;Taiwan Film Manifesto&quot; was released. At this time, the peak of new films had passed and everyone began to struggle. This declaration is divided into three parts: &quot;Our views on movies&quot;, &quot;Our concerns about the environment&quot;, and &quot;The changes we expect and our own determination&quot;. I went out of my way to see the worries and doubts of these young filmmakers back then, and they proposed: We believe that movies have many possibilities, and we must strive for space for the existence of &quot;another kind of movie&quot; besides commercial movies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At this point, new films as a trend have quickly dissipated. Since then, everyone’s creations have had to follow the market and personal destiny. For example, many filmmakers do not focus on the reality of Taiwan and do not seek funds from the country ( &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;The same is true for Hou Hsiao-hsien&lt;/span>;). The advantage of doing this is that it will not be affected by certain policies in Taiwan. The disadvantage is that it will distance you from reality and indulge in memories. Suspicion. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Actually, Hou Hsiao-hsien is not my film inspiration. In 2015, I finally watched Hou Hsiao-hsien&#39;s movie &quot;The Assassin&quot; on the big screen in mainland China. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I wrote a paragraph after watching the movie:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;&quot;The Assassin Nie Yinniang&quot; does not tell how Nie Yinniang became an assassin, but how she did not become an assassin. First of all, the camera sets the atmosphere .When many directors take pictures of a group of talking people, Hou Hsiao-hsien pays attention to the people standing in the corner. He is behind the camera and does not lead us to see anything. Instead, he follows the movement of the camera to feel what is hidden inside. , there is always a pair of eyes lingering near the speaker.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Recently, news came out that the director was suffering from Alzheimer&#39;s disease, and his family confirmed that he had fully returned to family life and was recuperating. In fact, there have been rumors in the circle about Director Hou suffering from dementia for several years. I think it&#39;s boring to say that a director like him has &quot;retired&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Acheng wrote about a scene in an article. He said that there was originally a braid-cutting scene in &quot;A Dream of Life&quot;, which required more than a hundred braids to be cut off at once. In one shot, it could only be filmed. once. Everyone was very nervous during the filming. As a result, the camera of a female reporter flashed as soon as the braid was cut. Everyone immediately looked at the little girl. No one dared to speak. The little girl was so frightened that she cried. Hou Hsiao-hsien said nothing. &quot;Anyway, the shot was in vain, so there&#39;s no way we can shoot it again.&quot; This quote comes from cinematographer Yao Hongyi, who has worked with Director Hou for many years. In fact, it quite reflects Hou Hsiao-hsien&#39;s attitude towards movies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In recent years, there have been news from time to time about Hou Hsiao-hsien&#39;s new film &quot;Searching for the River God&quot;, but I think it may not be seen. If you can’t see it, it doesn’t matter. He likes to say to young people who make movies: &quot;You can&#39;t escape what kind of person you are when you make whatever you want!&quot; In one of his movies, the young man, regardless of what kind of person he is, shot the movie under prohibited circumstances. A group of young people rode motorcycles and passed by the Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall, leaving him far behind. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/SbJLfSLKF8mdame1OTbhxi33amRDigs5TW8L3lWS.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;540&quot; data-src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/SbJLfSLKF8mdame1OTbhxi33amRDigs5TW8L3lWS.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256540&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many years In the future, when I revisit these vivid and somewhat joyful movie scenes, I will feel a kind of gratitude that is difficult for others to understand. There are already so many works by Director Hou that can be watched over and over again, isn’t that enough? It just so happens that this last film has a meaningful name - &quot;River God&quot; may refer to himself. Therefore, some people speculate that this movie may be done by the descendants he has trained for many years... This is because it is too unclear what kind of person Hou Hsiao-hsien is. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Starting from &quot;The Man from Fenggui&quot; in 1983, Hou Hsiao-hsien became more and more isolated on his path until &quot;The Assassin&quot; won the award at the Cannes Film Festival in 2015. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the movie road, such people are almost extinct. What does such a person look like? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Even though he could blend in, he could keep up with the new era, he could incite young people...he didn&#39;t have any of it. I am reminded here of a quote by Truffaut: “If my films contradict the times in which I live, as I am sometimes accused of doing, it is perhaps because I sympathize with those who have to struggle to enter a world from which they are excluded. People of the world.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The confused young filmmakers will come to their senses sooner or later. The existence of Hou Hsiao-hsien means an &quot;ecology&quot;. There is at least a gap left in the world of movies, which is much more important than countless specific movies. The bigger the bubble, the more likely it will burst; no matter how weak the hope is, it is still hope. Maybe I&#39;m pessimistic, but sometimes optimism can be deceptive. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Even if his friend Edward Yang was still alive, even if the new movies were still a hit, and even if art films finally opened up a market of their own, Hou Hsiao-hsien might have said: &quot;There is no one like him.&quot; He had already seen clearly that All true artists, in the end, will not be able to have anyone around them - at that time, they will become &quot;everyone&quot;, the so-called &quot;see themselves, see the world, and see all living beings&quot;. There is no escaping this. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 04 Nov 2023 20:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[盲人“看”世界]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259957]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-04 19:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;According to relevant data from the China Blind Association, there are approximately 17.3 million blind people in our country.

If we can provide drama fans with better after-sales service and experience, we can take out more from the fans&#39; pockets. More money can also increase the loyalty of drama fans to the platform, which will help increase the value of platform members. Therefore, after-sales services in the form of after-sales concerts, after-sales parties, after-sales sharing sessions, etc. are becoming more and more popular. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;After-sales concerts are generally broadcast simultaneously online and offline. Offline tickets need to be purchased at a high price, or only by purchasing a platform membership card can you get the chance to draw tickets. Online live broadcasts require the purchase of live broadcast tickets. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;At the concert, the main creators gathered together to sing theme songs, restore famous scenes, and play interactive games, which formed the main content of the concert. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The trend of after-sales concerts was first sparked by the 2019 &quot;Chen Qing Ling&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;After the series ended, the platform held two Chinese-style concerts in Nanjing, selling more than 16,000 tickets in six price ranges from 627 yuan to 1,980 yuan5 It was sold out within seconds. If you didn’t grab the ticket, you can still buy the platform’s online live broadcast tickets at prices ranging from 25 yuan to 50 yuan. &quot;Chen Qing Ling&quot; successfully tested the waters, allowing the industry to see the huge market space for after-sales concerts of popular dramas. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In 2020, the fairy tale drama &quot;Liu Li&quot; became a dark horse in the summer season and gained many loyal fans. Since it is impossible to gather offline due to the epidemic, the platform has customized a cloud singing party for drama fans. Audiences can pay to watch it at prices ranging from 25 yuan (member price) to 50 yuan (non-member price). &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The 2021 hit drama &quot;Shanhe Ling&quot; has replicated the amazing popularity of the &quot;Chen Qing Ling&quot; after-sales concert. There were two consecutive concerts in Suzhou, with the highest ticket price reaching 2,280 yuan (more expensive than a ticket for a first-line singer&#39;s concert). 600,000 people bought tickets online, and it took 14 seconds to sell out. Online live broadcast tickets also cost 68 yuan each. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Afterwards, with the official crackdown on chaos in the entertainment industry, the format of after-sales concerts for popular dramas stopped for a while. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;This summer, an improved version of after-sales concerts will return. However, both &quot;Lotus Tower&quot; and &quot;Sauvignon Blanc&quot; have significantly reduced the number of offline audiences, with only a few hundred people offline. This can make the approval of performances more efficient, and can also avoid some uncontrollable chaos in the entertainment industry, and avoid Public criticism. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Offline tickets are exclusive to high-level members. Only those who have purchased a one-year membership will have the chance to win the lottery.

Is it going to give back to the fans of the drama and provide benefits to the fans of the drama? &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Obviously not that simple. If it is really a benefit, then should online viewing be free? It may be true that the platform gives back to drama fans, but it must be true that it makes another wave of money from drama fans. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Chen Qing Ling&quot; has verified how strong the purchasing power of drama fans is. A single offline ticket for &quot;Chen Qing Ling&quot; was sold to 150,000 by scalpers; online VIP tickets are 30 yuan/ticket, non-VIP tickets are 50 yuan/ticket, and group tickets are 25 yuan/ticket. The total number of people in the live concert room exceeds 3.2 million. If Based on an average of 30 yuan per person, the total online revenue is nearly 100 million yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Not only are the offline tickets for &quot;Ling of Mountains and Rivers&quot; more expensive than those of &quot;Chen Qing Ling&quot;, but the price of online live broadcast tickets is as high as 68 yuan per piece, but at no point It did not affect the enthusiasm of fans of the drama. The Douban score of &quot;Shan He Ling Born Bosom Friend Concert&quot; is as high as 9.5 points, which shows that fans of the drama are very happy with their money. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Lotus Tower&quot; has changed to a new format. Even if the number of offline concert tickets is limited, they are basically not sold to the outside world. Buying members and drawing tickets can also It provides a great boost to the platform’s membership fees. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Drama fans need to purchase a 448 yuan/year Star Diamond membership (or membership level V7) to get 1 chance to draw tickets, and the number of times they purchase a Star Diamond membership Unrestricted. In order to be able to draw tickets, some fans of the drama bought a 10-year Star Diamond membership in one go. The membership fee also costs 4,480 yuan, which is more expensive than offline concert tickets, and they may not be able to win the lottery. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Sauvignon Blanc&quot; is also played in a similar way. Users who purchase the SVIP annual card of the platform can get 10 lottery opportunities, and the annual card price is 488 yuan. The platform limits the number of recharges for the SVIP annual card, which can only be recharged a maximum of 3 times. This avoids excessive consumption by fans and can also increase users’ enthusiasm for paying for prize draws. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In short, there are always ways to make money when the platform holds after-sales concerts. In the short term, you can directly collect money from fans of the drama. In the long term, after-sales concerts will become part of the platform’s membership services. If there is a second season like &quot;Sauvignon Blanc&quot;, it can also build momentum for the second season. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Main actors who have starred in hit dramas will basically attend after-sales concerts. This helps extend the character&#39;s popularity to the actors. What&#39;s more, if other main creators are participating, a single leading actor may be accused of being &quot;insincere&quot; by fans of the drama, and may be &quot;out of touch&quot; or &quot;back-stepped&quot;. . Therefore, as long as most of the core creators agree to hold an after-sales concert, the remaining starring actors will only have the option of &quot;agree&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;It pays to fool drama fans&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Due to character filtering Mirror, drama fans are very tolerant of after-sales concerts. For example, if the actor is not a professional singer, they do not require him to sing well. Drama fans generally have a request, hoping to see traces of the characters in the interactions of the actors, so that the beautiful emotions in the drama can continue offline, and the regrets in the drama can be made up for offline. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;This puts forward high requirements for the restoration and interaction of after-sales concerts - this is why many after-sales concerts have actors wearing costumes from the drama Costumes are used in performances to give drama fans a stronger sense of immersion. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Lotus Tower&quot; is like this, with a high degree of restoration, full of sincerity, and has been well received. Although &quot;Sauvignon Blanc&quot; received many bad reviews, the restoration of the Qingshui Town part of the play became a highlight of the concert. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Once the degree of restoration is poor and the interactivity is insufficient, the after-sales concert will instead make the audience laugh and let the audience &quot;get out of the trap&quot;. The previous Cloud Song Concert of &quot;Liu Li&quot; shocked drama fans because the male and female protagonists had almost no interaction on stage. The Douban score of &quot;Liu Li Finale Cloud Song Concert&quot; was as low as 2.4 points. As soon as the after-sales concert ended, the actor dropped a few points. Thousands of fans. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;This time the &quot;Sauvignon Blanc&quot; after-sales concert was criticized, it was not the actor&#39;s problem. Yang Zi&#39;s emotion for the character is still very touching. Tan Jianci was late because of a traffic jam. When he arrived, he sang, danced and adjusted the atmosphere. He was very dedicated. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The problem mainly lies in the planning of the concert, such as asking the five main actors to pose strange poses in front of the flower arrangements, having Zhang Wanyi recite, and having Deng Wei Cooking, and having Yang Zi and Dai Luwa wearing high heels recreate the fighting scenes in the play... there was little restoration, and the interaction was awkward. It was originally intended to build momentum for the second season, but it actually caused some fans of the show to leave disappointed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;After-sales concerts seem to be very profitable, but planning them well is not easy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;When the characters in the play are like each other, the offline actors may not be familiar with each other in reality. This requires efforts in planning and in the early stages. Coordinate and communicate more with the actors. For example, you can let the actors wear costumes to continue &quot;performing&quot; in the play, or you can use interesting game designs to allow the actors to have more interactions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;It is foreseeable that after-sales concerts of &quot;small scale offline, money to watch online&quot; will become a new normal for hit dramas in the future. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Drama fans are willing to spend money to &quot;buy benefits&quot;. However, it is worth noting that if the platform is fooled and really treats drama fans as &quot;leeks&quot;, it will It will damage the credibility of the platform and also have a negative impact on the actors. When the platform wants to organize after-sales services, actors may not participate, members are unwilling to pay, and the platform has completely lost a way to make money. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 04 Nov 2023 18:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[刘家昌自曝家丑为哪般？“先小人后君子”才能财产婚姻两全丨快评]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259969]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-04 17:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;On October 26 and November 1, 2023, the famous musician Liu Jiachang published two long articles in succession Accusing his ex-wife Zhen Zhen attracted public attention.

For a time, public opinion was greatly divided. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu Jiachang’s main accusation against Zhen Zhen can be divided into two parts. The first is the issue of division of marital property. Liu Jiachang accused Zhenzhen of transferring Liu&#39;s assets to her name in various ways over the years, including but not limited to company equity, music copyrights and cash income; the second was the issue of his son&#39;s education and growth. Liu accused Zhen Zhen of controlling his son but failing to teach him how to spoil him. He made his son drop out of school again and again and became naughty. He got into troubles including drunkenness, racing, beating people, and soliciting prostitutes. Liu tried his best to encourage his son to make music, but failed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To sum up, Liu Jiachang claimed that he &quot;disclosed his family affairs&quot; because of his failed marriage and hurt feelings. He posted a long article accusing Zhenzhen mother and son just to vent his anger so as not to &quot;die unjustly&quot;. It seems inappropriate. It was all about fighting for property, because he also promised to donate his property to charity if he won the case. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Regarding Liu’s first long article, Zhen Zhen also issued a counterattack, accusing Liu Jiachang of being addicted to gambling and suppressing his son. It was Liu Jiachang who stole his property, not the other way around; Liu Jiachang After the second long article was released, Zhen Zhen also criticized Liu Jiachang for slandering herself and her son, saying, &quot;It&#39;s really shameless.&quot; Their son Zhang Liheng (formerly known as Liu Ziqian) also supported his mother on social media. The &quot;mutual conflict&quot; between the two sides shows that each has his own words, but in order to determine which is right and which is wrong, we should return to the level of facts and legal principles. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the property dispute between the two parties, there are many factual issues that are not difficult to prove or falsify. Written evidence can be used to determine whether these properties were earned by Liu Jiachang, or whether they were simply &quot;registered in the name of his wife Zhenzhen&quot; as joint property of the couple. For example, the audit report mentioned by Liu Jiachang, and the Income details, tax return records, property registration records from across the Taiwan Strait, the three places and the United States, as well as legal documents regarding music copyrights, company equity, real estate ownership, and the agreements between the two parties on the property, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhen Zhen accused Liu Jiachang of being &quot;addicted to gambling&quot;, and Liu Jiachang responded that &quot;he only used his own money for gambling.&quot; Liu Jiachang accused Zhen Zhen of &quot;not filming for forty years&quot; and that all the joint property was earned by herself. Zhen Zhen also personally told the media that every penny earned by Liu was given to Zhen Zhen and her family. It&#39;s not difficult to prove. Liu&#39;s accusation and response can be summarized as, &quot;It is normal for a husband to make money outside and leave it to his wife to take care of, but Zhen Zhen should not assume that she earned all the money.&quot; Whether this argument can be established is the key issue in determining whether the dispute is right or wrong. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The second part of Liu Jiachang’s accusation, “Unvirtuous wife and unfilial son,” is even more difficult to verify because of its rich details and specific descriptions. Liu Wen accused Zhen Zhen of failing to teach her son well and his son was naughty and naughty. He was forced to drop out of school in Hong Kong, Shanghai, and the United States. He also got into troubles including drunkenness, beating people, speed driving, and soliciting prostitutes. Zhen Zhen even &quot;solicited prostitutes on behalf of her son.&quot; , these are specific and severe public accusations. Liu Jiachang should be responsible for providing evidence and ensuring the authenticity of the accusations, otherwise it will be suspected of slander. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu Jiachang also revealed in the long article that his son was able to successfully enroll in school or escape punishment many times by relying on his connections with &quot;big men&quot; such as Run Run Shaw. If these incidents really happened, there must be others. There are too many informed third parties who can verify one by one, and it does not rule out that there are still many cases that can be verified. Liu Jiachang also mentioned that he tried his best to help his son make music but failed. This can also be supported by the record company and related people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From a legal perspective, it is meaningless for both parties to resort to personal attacks in moral trials. The focus should still be on the common property division issues in divorce proceedings.双方互相指控对方侵吞自己财产，这应交给专事婚姻法与公司法的专业律师进行诉讼博弈，一切依据正常的诉讼程序进行即可；甄珍说双方1987年就已在美国离婚，刘家昌则说是2015年在香港诉讼离婚，其中真相如何，也需要多地乃至多国法院的认定。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;公众究竟应该相信谁的小作文？这就仍然需要以事实为基础、以法律为准绳，才能得出较为公正的判断。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;刘家昌与甄珍的离婚纠纷其实已经持续多年，陈年旧事之所以再度浮上水面，还是因为离婚产生的财产分割争议，以及夹杂着亲子人伦关系的巨大利益纠葛。哪怕是一对普通夫妻，在离婚纠纷时也会产生类似的“罗生门”，遑论需要分割巨额财产、存在巨大利益冲突的明星夫妇。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;从刘家昌的指控来看，他颇有一种“被钱伤了感情”的愤懑，也有“因为感情而伤了钱”的怨望，字里行间给人的印象是，他本是“老派爱面子的人”，遵循中国人“男主外女主内”的传统婚姻家庭价值观，却被老婆处心积虑的“婚姻争产”弄得身心俱疲。他们的婚姻之所以失败，而且陷入“谈感情伤钱，谈钱伤感情”的恶性循环，财务决策不清与婚恋决策不到位也是重要的诱因。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;对比诸多明星夫妇“和平分手”与“离婚互撕”的案例可知，“和平分手”成功的关键在于双方做好了充分完备的婚前财产公证，以及婚后财产的分割程序，“先小人后君子”的办法等于是“以共同利益追求共同感情”，而不至于“以感情之名谋取利益”，在婚前就把一旦离婚时的财产与抚养权分配问题弄明白了，最终也更好地保护了双方的各自利益，不至于沦落到以小作文来进行网上对轰。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;坊间说，两个一线城市有房小康之家的结合都像是两个公司合并，存在大额财产的分配问题。最好先做好婚前财产切割，才能有效杜绝可能产生的纠纷。以此比照，明星结婚牵涉巨额财产，在结婚之前就更应该约定好分手时如何分割财产与孩子抚养权，否则的话，难免陷入“小作文互撕”的一地鸡毛。此次刘家昌与甄珍互撕，也再次证明了这一点。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 04 Nov 2023 17:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[环状RNA有望成为下一代重磅药物]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259706]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-04 15:15:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;For the invention of mRNA vaccine technology, American scientists Katalin Karikó and Drew Wei Drew Weissman won the 2023 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. The mRNA vaccine has not only saved millions of people around the world from being killed by the new coronavirus, but has also brought tens of billions of dollars in revenue to institutions and scientists engaged in vaccine development and production. This has drawn much attention to RNA, an unstable small nucleic acid molecule. Scientists and medical research and development institutions are working hard to develop new RNA drugs, and circular RNA is expected to become the next generation of blockbuster RNA drugs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/PeKYI0DjhC680SKp0veP23hYpVIlP2zwrilYSNFF.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1248&quot; height= &quot;814&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/01/PeKYI0DjhC680SKp0veP23hYpVIlP2zwrilYSNFF.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;256317&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Circular RNA therapy is gaining more and more attention. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Nature website/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;What is circular RNA&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Each The DNA molecule of a gene generally contains several exon sequences, separated by introns. It must first be transcribed into a single-stranded precursor mRNA. After shearing by shearing enzyme, the intron part is cut out, and then the exon part is cut out. The exons are spliced ​​together to form a functional mRNA, which then binds to the ribosome and guides it to synthesize proteins. Therefore, mRNA is a &quot;reduced version&quot; of the gene&#39;s DNA molecule, carrying the complete genetic information of the gene in the most streamlined nucleotides. The reason why mRNA can be used as a vaccine is that it can directly instruct cells to synthesize the corresponding antigen proteins, thereby triggering the body&#39;s immune system to produce antibodies to fight the virus. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the mRNA vaccine had a bumpy road before encountering the new coronavirus, and it was basically ignored. As a result, Carrico was unable to receive funding, and was transferred, reduced, or even fired from his job many times. Compared with double-stranded DNA molecules of genes, mRNA molecules have a simple structure and are extremely unstable. They generally have a single-stranded linear structure and are easily broken down by RNase. Therefore, the half-life of mRNA in the body is usually only a few hours. Such a short survival time is enough for vaccines, because the mRNA can immediately guide the cells to synthesize antigen proteins after entering the cells. However, for diseases such as cancer, neurological diseases, and genetic diseases that require large amounts of continuous protein treatment, the RNA persists in the body. time is too short. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Interestingly, RNase mainly &quot;bullies&quot; linear RNA, but has no way of attacking circular RNA. In fact, scientists have discovered that there is a kind of RNA in living organisms that can be connected end to end and likes to circle around itself more than 40 years ago. Through the continuous efforts of scientists, this circular RNA has recently begun to show great medical uses. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1976, Swiss virologist Daniel Kola Kofsky and a German research team discovered circular RNAs in mouse and plant viruses respectively. Circular forms are present in viruses, but have not attracted enough attention. In the early 1990s, researchers discovered such circular RNA molecules in human and other mammalian cells and proved that these circular RNAs are the transcript products of certain genes. Later, scientists discovered that circular RNA exists in almost all living things. However, compared with linear RNA, most circular RNA splicing is often chaotic and cannot guide cells to synthesize the corresponding proteins. It is also unclear what the purpose of circular RNA is. In the first thirty years after the discovery of circular RNA, , people have always mistaken it as the product of incorrect splicing during gene transcription, so it has not attracted much attention. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;With the development of RNA sequencing technology, scientists have discovered that circular RNA is very abundant in mammalian cells, highly conserved, far more stable than linear RNA, and plays many functions, and is not dispensable &quot;junk&quot; . Research shows that more than 60% of human genes can produce both circular and linear transcripts. Currently, more than 100,000 types of circular RNA have been discovered in human cells, which is much higher than the number of known human genes (about 20,000). ). Because it is not susceptible to RNase degradation, in some cells, the half-life of natural circRNA can be 2-4 times that of linear RNA, or even longer, while synthetic circRNA can survive in cells for several days, and The abundance of circular RNA in cells can reach more than 10 times that of linear RNA of related genes. Scientists have also discovered that endogenous circRNAs are involved in a variety of biological functions, including gene transcription, protein translation, immune response, cell proliferation and physiological regulation of tumorigenesis, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Most circular RNAs lack the necessary structure for ribosome recognition and are generally non-coding, that is, they cannot translate proteins. However, there are also a few that are coding RNAs, and these encoded proteins can also function. normal functionality. In 1995, researchers at the University of Colorado Health Science Center realized the coding function of circular RNA in vitro for the first time. Adding an internal ribosome entry site was crucial. This also laid the foundation for the development of circular RNA as vaccines and protein drugs. . &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Technological breakthroughs bring hope&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Since most natural circular RNAs cannot encode proteins and must be artificially designed and synthesized, scientists have Circular RNA technology has undergone a series of improvements and improvements, and has achieved a series of major breakthroughs. For example, in July 2022, the research team of Howard Y. Chang at Stanford University published an important study in the journal Nature Biotechnology. They made a series of improvements to the structure of circular RNA and optimized the translation process. Modules such as the initiation region, termination region, and internal ribosome entry site are implemented, and modular assembly is achieved, making protein translation easier to initiate and more efficient. Compared with unmodified circRNA, the recombinant protein expression level of modified circRNA can be increased hundreds of times. In vivo experiments in mice have shown that circRNA can be maintained in cells for more than 7 days, and only a small amount of circRNA molecules are needed to maintain high protein levels in cells for a longer period of time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Other major technological breakthroughs include: adding complementary sequences at both ends and in the middle of RNA to allow RNA to automatically form a loop and be more stable; allowing circular RNA to carry longer nucleotide chains, such as more than 12,000 nucleotide dystrophin gene sequence to synthesize more complex proteins; optimize circRNA delivery systems, such as lentivirus or exosome systems, to efficiently deliver circRNA to target cells; use genetic engineering technology Prepare circRNA on a large scale to save a lot of cost and time in circRNA preparation, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to technological improvements, the potential application of circular RNA in the medical field is another research hotspot. In March 2022, Peking University Wei Wensheng&#39;s team published a paper in the journal Cell confirming that compared with linear mRNA vaccines, circular RNA vaccines can induce more neutralizing antibodies and more effective T Cellular response. In May 2023, Zhang Yuanhao&#39;s team at Stanford University published an article in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences proving that circRNA has the potential to be developed into anti-viral and anti-tumor vaccines. They used circRNA prepared in vitro (can encode viral protein antigens) Immunization of mice induces innate activation of dendritic cells, stimulating robust antigen-specific CD8 T cell responses in lymph nodes and tissues. Immunity experiments in mice showed that circular RNA designed for melanoma could significantly inhibit tumor growth in mice compared with untreated mice. This indicates that circRNA can be used as a therapeutic vaccine to induce strong cellular immunity and eliminate tumors. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Compared with linear mRNA products, circular RNA products have several major advantages. First, circular RNA is more stable and easier to store than linear mRNA. This is because of its structural characteristics, linear mRNA is easy to transport It is degraded by RNase during storage, delivery, etc., so it must be cryopreserved and cold-chain transported. Even if linear mRNA is subjected to a series of modifications such as nucleotide modification, the cost and effect are still not ideal, while circular RNA can be It can be stored at room temperature for about a month and can be frozen and thawed repeatedly. Secondly, circRNA is safer than linear RNA. Research shows that natural circRNA molecules show lower immunogenicity and cytotoxicity. Thirdly, circRNA is safer than linear RNA. RNA-like RNA has the ability to produce prolonged antigens and can induce a long-lasting immune response in the body, thus promoting the production of more antibodies and longer-lasting immune protection. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Therefore, circRNA products are expected to become a better choice in the field of RNA therapy for various refractory diseases such as viral infections, tumors, pathogenic bacterial infections, autoimmune diseases, metabolic diseases, etc. play a greater role in disease prevention and treatment. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Has received huge investments&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Inspired by the great success of mRNA vaccines, some scientists around the world who are engaged in pioneering research on circRNA have also established a number of A circular RNA company was founded, and it quickly became favored and sought after by capital. Some biopharmaceutical giants have also joined the trend of developing circular RNA pharmaceutical products, hoping to take the initiative in future competition. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Daniel Anderson of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and others founded Orna Therapeutics in 2019. The company’s pipeline products mainly include anti-tumor and anti-infection drugs. and circular RNA therapies for the treatment of genetic diseases, but they are all in the early stages of development. The company plans to launch the first clinical trial in 2024. In February 2021 and August 2022, Orna completed Series A and Series B financing of US$80 million and US$220 million respectively. Merck, a pharmaceutical giant with a history of 130 years, seems to be very optimistic about this startup. It has paid an advance payment of US$150 million and plans to jointly develop circular RNA therapies for infectious diseases with Orna Company, while injecting US$100 million to participate. Received Orna’s Series B financing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Laronde was founded by Flagship Pioneering with an investment of US$50 million on May 11, 2021. It received US$440 million in financing three months later, making it the largest environmental investment company so far. This is the largest financing ever received by an RNA company. Since the flagship Pioneer Company once incubated the RNA vaccine star company Moderna of the United States, Lloyd&#39;s Company is also known as &quot;Modena 2.0&quot;. After receiving huge financing, the company is focusing on preventive and therapeutic circular RNA product development and clinical trials. However, on June 12, 2023, a joint investigation report released by the Boston Globe and STAT showed that the company was suspected of falsifying preclinical experimental data. For example, the circular RNA it developed for weight loss drugs only worked in mice. Expression, but not in monkeys. In a subsequent statement, the company also admitted the data fraud designed in the above report and dealt with the relevant responsible persons. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yuanhao Zhang of MIT founded Orbital Therapeutics in September 2022 with Drew Weisman, pioneer of mRNA vaccine technology and winner of the 2023 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, and others. ) company, which completed a Series A financing of up to US$270 million in April 2023. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;China also has a number of start-up companies developing circRNA drugs. Circode Bio was founded in September 2018 by researcher Wang Zefeng of the Max Planck Institute of Computing Technology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and others. It is the world&#39;s first start-up company to develop nucleic acid drugs based on circular RNA. In December 2021, Huanma Biotech completed Pre-A round financing of more than 20 million US dollars, and in August 2023, it completed another tens of millions of US dollars in Series A financing. At present, the company has reached a research and development cooperation agreement with the American pharmaceutical giant Pfizer to jointly develop circular RNA therapies. Yuanyin Biotech was founded by Professor Wei Wensheng of Peking University and others in April 2021. In June 2022, it successfully completed a Series A financing of more than 280 million yuan. Together with the angel round and Pre-A round of financing, the company has accumulated more than 400 million yuan. The company&#39;s R&amp;D pipeline includes circRNA products for the treatment of infectious diseases, metabolic diseases and tumors. Among them, the fastest-growing product is the circRNA COVID-19 vaccine, which has completed preclinical trials and entered clinical trials. However, due to the global COVID-19 The epidemic has calmed down, and it is expected that the development of the new crown vaccine may be shelved. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, overall, the current research on circRNA therapy has just begun. To achieve what one start-up company predicts, circRNA will start a revolution or achieve 100 therapeutic goals within ten years. The promise of a new drug project still has a long way to go. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 04 Nov 2023 15:25:06 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[又见哄抢，还要纵容？？丨快评]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259965]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-04 15:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Recently, Chinese medicinal materials grown by a farmer in Huaiyang District, Zhoukou City, Henan Province were robbed by local villagers, once again causing Internet extremes Big attention. Not long ago, there was an incident of villagers robbing corn in the city. On a wider scale, such incidents of theft and robbery of large growers are common on the Internet. This is closely related to the fact that the place where the incident occurred deliberately downplayed the illegal nature of the villagers&#39; looting and condoned the villagers&#39; infringement of the rights and interests of agricultural investors. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the robbery of Chinese medicinal materials in Zhoukou attracted attention, the Huaiyang District Agriculture and Rural Affairs Bureau issued a situation report on November 1, saying that the incident was not a robbery, but the villagers &quot;mistakenly believed&quot; that the growers had harvested for the second time. After finishing, he went into the field to pick up medicinal materials. The growers called the police after trying to dissuade them to no avail. The police quickly arrived at the scene and &quot;persuaded&quot; the people to leave. The report also said that after the second harvest of medicinal materials is completed, it is &quot;a habit for many years&quot; for growers to allow villagers to pick up leftover medicinal materials in the fields. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Pick up&quot;, &quot;years of habit&quot; and &quot;mistake&quot; are cliches that can be seen in almost every incident where growers are robbed. Half a month ago, after the corn robbery incident in Dancheng County, Zhoukou City, the local Agriculture and Rural Affairs Bureau responded that &quot;people went to harvested plots to pick up corn.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These excuses are really ridiculous. Even if there is a local habit of &quot;picking up&quot;, even if the growers allow the villagers to pick up after the second harvest is completed, the growers have repeatedly blocked the looting. If the farmers turn a blind eye and don&#39;t hear, is this still &quot;allowed&quot; by the growers? Is this still legal &quot;picking&quot;? In the Dancheng County corn robbery incident, hundreds of villagers also ignored the growers&#39; obstruction and ran to the unharvested plots in front of the harvesters to &quot;pick up&quot; them, forcing the harvesters to stop working to avoid accidental injuries. Is this still traditional &quot;picking up&quot;? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the case of Gushi County public officials driving patrol cars to steal sorghum, the growers had not yet harvested the sorghum. This cannot be excused by &quot;picking up&quot;, right? But in the eyes of some local people, cutting a few ears of sorghum is not a big deal. &quot;Rural people just like to take advantage of themselves.&quot; Patrols are arranged to avoid safety accidents, not to stop theft. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When local officials faced the looting incident, they not only downplayed it in words and justified large-scale looting, but also in action. Whether it was the robbery of Chinese medicinal materials in Huaiyang or the robbery of corn in Dancheng, after the growers called the police and reported it to the government, the police arrived only to &quot;maintain order&quot; and &quot;persuade&quot; the villagers to leave. What order should be maintained? Do we still need the police to maintain order and escort during looting? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;How to characterize looting behavior? Article 268 of the Criminal Law stipulates that if a crowd is gathered to rob public or private property, the amount is relatively large or there are other serious circumstances, the ringleaders and active participants shall be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of not more than three years, criminal detention or surveillance, and shall also be fined; if the amount is huge or there are other special circumstances, If the circumstances are serious, the offender shall be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of not less than three years but not more than ten years, and shall also be fined. The standards for relatively large amounts and huge amounts shall be determined by each high court. According to the standards of the Shanghai High Court, robbery of property worth more than 4,000 yuan is considered a &quot;large amount&quot;, and more than 40,000 yuan is a &quot;huge amount.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The crime of gathering a crowd to rob property will only punish ringleaders and active participants. For ordinary participants, if they cannot be convicted, administrative penalties can also be imposed. The Public Security Administration Punishment Law stipulates that those who rob public or private property shall be detained for not less than five days but not more than ten days, and may also be fined not more than five hundred yuan; if the circumstances are serious, they shall be detained for not less than ten days but not more than fifteen days, and may also be fined not more than five hundred yuan. the following fines. For those who do not rob but steal, the provisions of the Criminal Law and the Public Security Administration Punishment Law on theft can be applied. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But in reality, the police often give a wide berth to these acts of robbery and theft. A few years ago, a melon farmer in Zhejiang had all 30,000 kilograms of watermelons stolen overnight. After investigation, the police determined that the melon pickers had mistakenly believed the rumor that &quot;the melon grower didn&#39;t want them any more.&quot; There was no theft. Based on the subjective intention, it was determined that it did not constitute theft, but was just a &quot;civil dispute&quot;, and the melon farmers were required to claim compensation through civil procedures. The watermelons grown by a melon farmer in Xi&#39;an, Shaanxi Province were also robbed by villagers. The village branch secretary said that the villagers &quot;believed the rumors.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If &quot;listening to rumors&quot; can be a reason for acquittal, then there is no illegal crime. If you want to steal something, just spread some &quot;rumors&quot;, and then you can steal it without hesitation. Is there such a ridiculous thing in the world? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some people defended the villagers on the grounds that the local farmers were old and helpless and had no means of living. These reasons are also untenable. Even if you encounter difficulties in your own life, you should go to the government to report the problem instead of grabbing other people&#39;s property. In fact, these excuses are completely imaginary excuses. Most of the villagers who participated in the looting were not in a state of poverty. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In recent years, similar incidents of robbery and theft have occurred frequently in many places. It must be said that they are related to the shielding, excuse and connivance of the local government and local police. After the incident, the local government only &quot;persuaded&quot; those who participated in the looting to hand back the looted property without punishing them. Even if some people refused to hand it back, nothing would happen. Of course, the robber will not stop, he will continue to rob next time, and he will not hand it back again. On the contrary, if after an incident, the relevant departments punish decisively, detain when they should be detained, sentence when they should be sentenced, and kill the chicken to scare the monkey, will anyone dare to rob it in the future? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2014, in Zhangzhou, Fujian, fish farmers from other places were robbed of fish by local villagers. The local police promptly filed a case and detained three villagers who participated in serious fish robbery and urged others to do so. The participating villagers &quot;surrendered&quot; and &quot;returned the stolen goods.&quot; Clearly declaring that looting is illegal and subject to legal penalties, and that the items stolen are &quot;stolen goods&quot; and must be returned, is the correct way to deal with this type of looting. Only in this way can we establish and maintain a good local business environment, attract more agricultural investment, and revitalize the countryside. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 04 Nov 2023 15:25:06 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
