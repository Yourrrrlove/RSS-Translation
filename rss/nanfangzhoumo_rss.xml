Issuance work; when he served as Chairman of Merrill Lynch China and Chairman of JP Morgan China, Li Xiaojia took the lead in the cross-border listing of the first batch of central state-owned enterprises such as CNOOC and China Mobile; he participated in the planning and initiation of the China National Offshore Oil Bid for Unique, and was He believes that &quot;created a new era for Chinese enterprises&quot;; after more than ten years in charge of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, he successfully promoted a number of strategic initiatives that were crucial in the history of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, including &quot;Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect&quot; and &quot;Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect&quot;. What impressed the market even more was the implementation of the reform of the different rights listing system for the same shares in 2018 and the acquisition of the London Metal Exchange in 2012. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Today, he started a business called &quot;Drip Irrigation Connect&quot; and established and operated the &quot;Drip Irrigation Connect&quot; ASX in accordance with the relevant administrative orders of the Macau government, hoping to &quot;connect international capital with China&#39;s small and micro enterprises.&quot; This is a revolutionary financial experiment on a global scale. After 7 months, on October 26, 2023, Drip Tong ASX was certified by the Sharia Regulatory Commission and complied with Islamic teachings such as the prohibition of interest collection. &lt;span>;This certification includes&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;Islamic Finance&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;’s confirmation that the income sharing product created by Diguantong is not a loan interest collection model, and recognizes that Diguantong’s investment is based on sharing of risks. Way. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;How did China issue its first global sovereign debt more than thirty years ago? Why did China&#39;s first batch of state-owned enterprises land in the U.S. capital market more than 20 years ago? Twenty years ago, how was the first overseas bidding done by a central enterprise? Over the past ten years, how has the Hong Kong Stock Exchange broken the ice and achieved interconnection with A-shares? In an exclusive interview with a reporter from Southern Weekend, Li Xiaojia reviewed these major events closely related to China&#39;s financial reform and opening up. He said that internationalization, embracing the new economy, and realizing interconnection are still the cornerstones of the success of Hong Kong&#39;s capital market today, and are also the reform and innovation for China&#39;s capital market to go global. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/07/5EWnxZd3yR8XQC3FJ53jIHcDL5jPWsU9tJYHwfSX.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;635&quot; height= &quot;794&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/07/5EWnxZd3yR8XQC3FJ53jIHcDL5jPWsU9tJYHwfSX.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;257287&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Li Xiaojia: former CEO of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange and current founder and chairman of Drip Tong Group&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo provided by interviewee/ Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;&lt;strong>;The overall benefits of promoting reform through overseas listing are multilateral&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>; &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You once took the lead in participating in China&#39;s first issuance of global sovereign bonds. What are the main difficulties in this issuance of global sovereign bonds? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Li Xiaojia:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Issuing bonds first requires a major rating agency to provide a credit rating to China’s sovereign. The more than two months I was involved in the rating work were very stressful. If the rating is not appropriate, China will not issue sovereign debt at all. There are many stories happening in it. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After hard work, China obtained an A-level sovereign rating in 1993 and successfully issued bonds early the next year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You also took the lead in presiding over the first batch of cross-border listings of central state-owned enterprises. What problem is it mainly intended to solve? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Li Xiaojia:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;The appeal at that time was very simple, which was to relieve the difficulties of state-owned enterprises. At that time, a large number of state-owned enterprises were in great difficulty and had severe triangular debt. The main motivation is the reform of state-owned enterprises, which requires financing and relies on funds to carry out reforms. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The reform of state-owned enterprises requires truly entering the market and operating in accordance with the laws of market economy. In this process, everyone quickly felt that it was easy to unify everyone&#39;s thoughts through financing through the listing itself. Then use overseas listing as a catalyst. If you want to raise funds overseas, central state-owned enterprises must make various reforms and separate government functions, social functions and corporate functions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These reforms have gradually become important in the process of overseas listing of central state-owned enterprises. It relies on financing to unify everyone&#39;s understanding. In order to achieve this goal, everyone slowly accepts some of the costs, some impacts and impacts that the reform must bear. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Has promoting reform through overseas listing achieved the expected goals? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Li Xiaojia: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Of course. First, the purpose, or overall benefit, is multilateral. The business itself raised large sums of money at the most critical time. In 1993, the first batch of 9 companies was launched, and soon there were 22 companies. These companies have used overseas financing to make large capital expenditures and solve a large number of funding problems needed for development. It was a very timely solution to an urgent need for funds at the time. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The cross-border listing of central state-owned enterprises has really sounded the clarion call for the reform of state-owned enterprises, driving and urging the reform of various aspects of systems and mechanisms that were originally very difficult to initiate. After listing overseas, the reform of state-owned enterprises slowly entered the main track. Everyone began to fully accept the reform of state-owned enterprises. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Not only that, the cross-border listing of central state-owned enterprises quickly gave birth to the development of China&#39;s capital market. It is impossible for all of our companies to be listed abroad, and with so much capital in China, the people also have money. Why can&#39;t our capital be invested in our own businesses? From the perspective of issuers and investors&#39; desire to participate in the development dividends of reform and opening up, it has promoted the birth and development of China&#39;s capital market. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another point that is also very important is that for the first time, a central state-owned enterprise has gone global. The outside world is beginning to understand Chinese companies and the Chinese economy. Then foreign capital has deeply cared about, participated in and experienced China&#39;s economic modernization due to their investment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;How much room do you think there is for improving the internal governance efficiency of central state-owned enterprises in my country? ? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Li Xiaojia:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Whether it is a state-owned enterprise or a central enterprise, it is just a form of ownership. Singapore also has a sovereign fund, but its operation method is completely market-oriented. Except for the identity of the investor, the other operating modes are the same as those of private enterprises. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some central enterprises are also very efficient. When it comes to improving efficiency, is the incentive mechanism for managers the same as that of other companies? We cannot simply say which is more efficient and which is better in terms of business ownership. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;&lt;strong>;It is basically impossible for the world to decouple&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Now, a group of central state-owned enterprises may have to be delisted from the New York Stock Exchange. What do you think of the current situation? Is it possible to move toward “capital decoupling”? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Li Xiaojia:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Even if delisting, decoupling from capital is still too far away. They are a very small minority of international capital participating in the development of the Chinese market. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Nowadays, the amount of foreign capital invested in China from all over the world is so large, including major private enterprises and central state-owned enterprises listed in Hong Kong. In addition to the obvious decoupling in the technology field, there will be some decoupling in other aspects. But it’s not at all to the point where we’ll never see each other again until we die. We have become accustomed to mutual penetration and connection with a highly developed capital market. The connection is much weaker now than it was in its heyday. If we look at the present from 20 to 30 years ago, it is basically impossible to decouple the connection in today’s world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The whole world is like a plane. How can the two largest engines of the world economy be decoupled? After 20 years of extremely deep and close cooperation, there is currently some pullback. Even after the withdrawal, the economic ties between the two countries are far from being described as decoupling. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;Two core considerations for the reform of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;: &lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Historical value and practical significance to the mainland&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/ h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;In the 10 years since you have been in charge of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, you have led a number of far-reaching reforms. . Which reforms are you more satisfied with? Why? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Li Xiaojia: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I usually don’t think about things this way. In the tide of history, a person happens to be very lucky to be in a very important and suitable position, and then he does something under the right time, place and people. These cannot be said to be the things of one person. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Which reforms have had the greatest impact during my tenure at the Hong Kong Stock Exchange? Does the mainland have more historical value and practical significance? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xiaojia Li:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;These are the two most important core considerations for all reforms of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The big theme is that Hong Kong, as an international market for a long time, should help the mainland capital market internationalize and help the international market become more integrated into the mainland. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From this perspective, everything must be solved systematically. After all, these two markets are two completely different systems. They have great motivation to integrate and interconnect with each other, and they also have very powerful internal mechanisms and forces. This makes interconnection very difficult. In other words, the two markets each have their own management systems, market systems, and operating methods. They are willing to integrate, but they are unwilling to significantly change their own institutions and systems for the sake of integration. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;How to take advantage of Hong Kong’s extremely unique position? We fully understand which aspects of the markets on both sides can be changed for the sake of interconnection, which aspects are impossible to change, and which aspects are necessary. Find a greatest common divisor and least common multiple, and find the maximum interconnection at the minimum cost. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In all reforms, we have to consider many issues. Perhaps some form of interconnection would be most effective and best, but it may be too costly. No one is willing to bear it; some things may be easy to reform, but they don&#39;t mean much. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, we started to want to choose very small things, such as the trading time periods of the two exchanges are different, and the opening and closing are different. It may seem like a small thing, but reform is not easy. It involves different living and working habits in the two places. It seems that this reform should not be controversial, but it was actually one of the most difficult reforms at the time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Looking back, the following reforms have great historical value and practical significance for the Hong Kong Exchange. First of all, the Hong Kong Stock Exchange cannot just be in the mainland market of Hong Kong. The Hong Kong Stock Exchange is not only in Asia, it should break through to Europe and the United States, because the mainland hopes to go international through the Hong Kong market; it cannot be just in the stock market, but also to the bulk commodity market that the mainland needs most. breakthrough. Therefore, the Hong Kong Stock Exchange merged and acquired the London Metal Exchange, and also tried to acquire the London Exchange, but failed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The second is the Hong Kong Stock Exchange stock market itself. Chinese technology companies have been unable to go public because of regulatory rules. They represent advanced productivity, but they can only be launched in the United States. It’s not that the previous regulatory logic was wrong, but when the whole world is competing, why do we cling to the original things without changing them? The regulatory logic of the United States is originally consistent with that of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, but it can find very practical reasons and allow changes. We will finally carry out reforms, and Xiaomi, JD.com, Alibaba, etc. can all return to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The market value of A-shares ranks second in the world. How can such a huge market be interconnected with the Hong Kong market and the international market without changing the respective rules and systems of both parties? Therefore, a series of reforms and innovations such as Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect, Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect, Bond Connect, and Bond Swap Connect have been launched one after another. The two markets have achieved basic interconnection functions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Internationalization, embracing the new economy, and realizing interconnection are still the cornerstones of the success of the Hong Kong market to this day, and are also the reform and innovation of China&#39;s capital market to the world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Do you still have any regrets about your work at the Hong Kong Stock Exchange? ? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xiaojia Li: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Now the Internet is a secondary market, that is, Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect and Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect can be traded southward or northbound. Stocks on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange or the Shanghai Stock Exchange. However, the interconnection has not extended to the primary market to the &quot;New Stock Connect&quot;. This is my regret. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I used to use &quot;New Stock Connect&quot; as the name of this product. The new Northbound Trading Connect allows the Chinese market to finally connect with world resources. Achieving interconnection in Hong Kong can achieve tremendous development. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;“&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;&lt;span>;Let international&lt;/span>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;&lt;span>;capital&lt;/span>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;&lt; span>;And China&#39;s small and micro&lt;/span>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;&lt;span>;enterprises fully&lt;/span>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;&lt;span>;China Unicom&lt;/span>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;&lt;span >;”&lt;/span>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Farewell to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange , you started your business with one of the world&#39;s latest investment models and trading models - Drip Tong ASX will be officially operated in August 2023. Drip Tong ASX aims to solve a global problem - financing difficulties for small and micro enterprises. Why can Drip Connect ASX solve this problem? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Xiaojia Li:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Driptong ASX is the world’s first licensed revenue sharing product (DRO) exchange. The vision and mission of Diguantong is to fully connect international capital with China&#39;s small and micro economy, and to achieve interconnection and interoperability between the two very incompatible operating systems of international traditional finance and China&#39;s small and micro economy. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The foundation and prerequisite for this breakthrough is the comprehensive spread of China’s digital revolution. A cashless society provides the possibility for a new and revolutionary form of financing. With this revolutionary premise and the addition of our own Drip Tong ASX, we have accomplished this. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If we don&#39;t do it, or if we don&#39;t do it well, someone else will soon do it. Just like when there was no Internet, Jack Ma jumped into the sky and couldn&#39;t do anything. After the advent of the Internet, he started Taobao, but soon there were also JD.com, Meituan, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It’s not that we brought a panacea and solved everyone’s problems all at once. It can only be said that we are the first. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Why did you become the first? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Li Xiaojia:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Most people engaged in finance look down on small and micro businesses and think it is impossible; those engaged in the Internet or digitalization Most people do not understand the nature of finance. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Why can it be done? We know that capital markets around the world mainly solve two problems. One is that investment information is accurate and authentic, and the other is that the safety of investment money and goods entering and exiting is guaranteed. Specifically, investors around the world will only invest in stocks or bonds, and only stocks and bonds of large companies, because the above two core issues that investors care about are the prerequisites for investment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to solve these two problems, traditional exchanges rely on a large number of professionals to make research reports, annual reports, etc.; settlement security relies on the endorsement of a series of institutions such as banks, securities firms, and exchanges to ensure the entry and exit of funds. Safety and security. But both events are extremely expensive. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this case, small and micro enterprises will not raise funds through listing and bond issuance. But in the current era of China&#39;s digital revolution, these two core problems can be solved at low cost. The income of a small store is fully reflected in the payment system, that is, the accuracy of the information. Let’s make a fuss about income. Can I invest in you and buy your income? Is it okay to take a share of the income? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for the issue of investment in and out security, we deduct money directly in the payment system and directly in the bank&#39;s separate ledger system. The issue of delivery security is solved. We can solve the two core functions of the Wall Street financial system through small chips. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To solve this problem is not to do charity, but to actually get the rewards back. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Someone has recently questioned this business model. At about the same time, ASX received certification from the Sharia Regulatory Commission. Liu Xingjuan, a member of the Executive Committee of the Monetary Authority of Macau, also said that the ASX will be monitored on a daily basis in accordance with the &quot;risk-based&quot; regulatory principle. What does the legal regulation of this innovative model look like? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Li Xiaojia:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;The investment chain is very clear: Drip Irrigation Tong raises funds through overseas institutions and jointly operates and opens stores in the mainland through foreign direct investment.

On November 6, a gang-related case she represented was heard publicly in the Xuanwei City People&#39;s Court of Yunnan. Before the trial, Chi Susheng was considered to have violated court discipline because he took two photos in the court, and his mobile phone was detained. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At around 6 p.m. that day, the presiding judge adjourned the trial. Chi Susheng asked for the return of his mobile phone and fell unconscious in the court after communicating with court staff to no avail. An hour later, she was sent to the emergency department of Xuanwei First People&#39;s Hospital for treatment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At around 4 p.m. on November 7, Chi Susheng told Southern Weekend reporters that Chen Yongfu, president of the Xuanwei Court, visited her in the hospital at around 1 p.m. that day and returned her phone at around 3 p.m. cell phone. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Two photos&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;At around 8:40 am on November 6, 2023, 20 minutes before the trial started, Chi Susheng arrived at the court. She recalled to Southern Weekend reporters that there was only one clerk at the scene, and the members of the collegial panel, prosecutors and other lawyers had not yet arrived. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is the twenty-first day of the first trial of a gang-related case. Previously, the case had gone through the first and second trials. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On December 10, 2021, the Xuanwei Court made a first-instance judgment and determined that Liu Shunping and the 10 people involved in the case did not constitute a crime of a mafia nature, but there were cases where Liu Shunping was the ringleader and members of the organization often gathered together to jointly commit crimes. Carrying out acts of provocation, extortion, and illegal detention, it was identified as an evil criminal group. Liu Shunping was punished concurrently for all the crimes committed by the group, and the remaining personnel were punished according to the criminal acts they participated in. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the first-instance verdict, Liu Shunping and others were dissatisfied and appealed. The prosecutor&#39;s office did not protest. On December 9, 2022, the second instance of Qujing Intermediate People’s Court ruled to revoke the original verdict on the grounds that “some facts were unclear” and remanded the case for retrial. During the retrial of the case, the Xuanwei City Procuratorate added three additional charges and still accused Liu Shunping and others of being involved in underworld crimes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After entering the court, Chi Susheng noticed 10 black iron interrogation chairs placed side by side on the defendant&#39;s seat, with devices for fixing hands and feet. Before this day, during the trial of this case, the defendant had been sitting on a conventional wooden chair with a backrest, and his hands and feet could move freely. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In her experience, this situation is not common. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the &quot;Court Rules of the People&#39;s Court of the People&#39;s Republic of China&quot; (hereinafter referred to as the &quot;Court Rules&quot;), unless the defendant is considered to be in great personal danger and may endanger the safety of the court, the court shall not treat the defendant during court hearings. Use a ring. Chi Susheng subconsciously raised his phone and took two photos of the interrogation chair. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Afterwards, she walked out of the court and stored her mobile phone in a metal cabinet outside the court in preparation for the hearing. At this time, other lawyers representing the case entered the scene one after another. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Chi Susheng and two other lawyers representing the case said that from the first day of the case, the court verbally asked them not to bring mobile phones into the court. Some lawyers once objected to this, arguing that the court rules only stipulated that no making or receiving phone calls were allowed, and did not prohibit the carrying of mobile phones. The court did not respond to this. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;4 communications&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Chi Susheng did not expect that her mobile phone would be impounded by the court because of the photos taken before the trial. Throughout the process, she communicated with court staff four times. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before the trial, Chi Susheng was called outside the court by the bailiff shortly after he put his mobile phone in the metal cabinet. She recalls a court employee asking her to delete the photo. She declined the request. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Court rules stipulate that all personnel are not allowed to record, videotape, take photos of, or use mobile communication tools to disseminate court proceedings during court proceedings. Anyone who violates this provision may be temporarily detained by the court. Equipment and storage media, delete content. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Chi Susheng believed that the trial had not started when he took the photo, so he did not violate court discipline. She later returned to court. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At around 10:20 a.m., the trial took a 20-minute intermission. Chi Susheng was asked to stay in the court, and the other lawyers were not allowed to enter the court. She remembered that the presiding judge asked to temporarily seize her mobile phone, and the clerk took notes at the scene. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The third communication occurred during the court session. During the afternoon hearing, it was Chi Susheng&#39;s turn to speak, and she continued to apply for the return of her mobile phone. She emphasized that she took the photos before the court was announced and the seizure of her mobile phone was unreasonable. She also said that if the court wanted to seize her mobile phone, it would need to provide written materials. The presiding judge said that if there are any violations of laws and regulations in the collegial panel, Chi Susheng can report the situation to the superiors. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At around 6:15 p.m., the court adjourned. When Chi Susheng went to the metal cabinet outside the court to pick up his mobile phone, he found that the mobile phone was no longer in the cabinet. At this point she has not used her phone for a day. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Last week, Chi Susheng received a notice that the trial of the gang-related case, which was originally scheduled to end on November 8, would be extended for one month. She was anxious to coordinate the court session with other courts. &quot;I was very anxious and shouted to the presiding judge, &#39;Give me your phone back.&#39; The presiding judge said, &#39;If you lose it, call the police.&#39;&quot; Both lawyers present said to the south Reporters over the weekend confirmed hearing the conversation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Chi Susheng returned to the court, hoping to find someone to negotiate the matter again. Later, she felt &quot;all over and couldn&#39;t stand&quot; and lay down on the chair at the lawyer&#39;s table.

Ten years later, I am still strong and full of energy. While admiring me, I think of the past. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One day in 2004, between the administration building and the library of the Chinese University, everyone on campus unanimously called On the steps of the Central Steps, I met a colleague who was about to retire. She has served the school for many years. Starting from Li Zhuomin, the founding president of CUHK, she has worked with five presidents. She can be said to be a veteran of the past dynasties. Chatting with her, she mentioned her retirement and that Principal Jin Yaoji was leaving soon. She felt deeply sad to leave. She suddenly said: &quot;Principal Jin is such a nice person, I&#39;m not afraid of him!&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Not afraid of him? Who would be afraid of Principal Kim? However, if you think about it further, why are subordinates not afraid of their supervisors? According to common sense, isn&#39;t it common for subordinates to be afraid of their supervisors? This made me have an image of this &quot;member&quot; in my mind - affable, smiling, humorous, witty, and talented; treating everyone equally, from the school director to the co-workers; when running the school, Accept advice and learn from it, follow the good as a rule; smoke a pipe when you are free, and enjoy yourself. Such a gentle and kind-hearted supervisor will of course make people &quot;respect and love him&quot; rather than &quot;keep him at arm&#39;s length&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I have known Professor Jin Yaoji for decades. At the beginning, there were not many teachers named Jin in the school. Since both of us were affiliated with New Asia, our colleagues mostly used &quot;Da Jin&quot; and &quot;Xiao Jin&quot; to distinguish each other, and we also called each other &quot;the family&quot;, adding Professor Jin&#39;s There is only one character difference between his name and my eldest brother&#39;s name, so I naturally regard him as an elder brother. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When I first met Professor Jin, it was still in the 1970s. I still remember that back then, this &quot;member of the family&quot; had just returned to Hong Kong from the United States. He was very handsome, young and promising. Not long after, he held important positions many times, and was later elected as the president of New Asia. At that time, Jin Yaoji was only in his early forties, and he was not from New Asia. These two factors may have caused him to encounter some obstacles when he first took charge of important tasks. However, with his outstanding intelligence and amazing courage, all difficulties were in his hands. , can all be easily solved. Since then, Professor Jin has been at CUHK for decades, and as he has moved up the ladder, he has more and more affairs and heavier responsibilities, but has anyone seen him looking sad and overwhelmed? In everyone&#39;s mind, Jin Gong always talks, laughs, and fights, and does everything lightly. Because of this, whenever the school has &quot;difficult and complicated diseases&quot;, they will naturally entrust them to him, hoping that he can &quot;prescribe the right medicine&quot; and rejuvenate them. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In December 2003, the CUHK Faculty and Staff Association held a Christmas dance, and Principal Jin was also invited. At the party, the host asked me to say a few words to pay tribute to him. I said: &quot;There are two kinds of leaders in the world: the first type, others respect and fear him; the second type, people respect and love him. Professor Jin certainly belongs to the second category.&quot; These words were recognized by everyone. That night, Principal Jin, who is usually not good at dancing, actually danced very happily surrounded by everyone. He is such a considerate and easy-going person. Over the years, whenever colleagues ask for advice, no matter how busy he is, he will put everything aside and listen attentively. This makes people feel that in Professor Jin&#39;s mind, you are the most important person and your affairs are the most important things. He is listening, he is thinking, he is sharing your burdens and resolving your worries. He is busy with everything, so he will stop time, accompany you, and protect you. No matter how bumpy the road ahead is, he will help you and solve your problems. How can such a supervisor not make people convinced? When colleagues work hard and serve the school wholeheartedly, he not only hears and sees them, but also expresses his gratitude through actions. On the eve of the degree awarding ceremony every year, colleagues in the public relations team are often extremely busy and stay up all night. One time, near midnight, Principal Jin actually visited the class in person and brought chocolates to express his condolences! Such a sincere leader can make the whole school work together as one, regardless of each other, to strive for a common goal. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Professor Jin is most praised for his outstanding eloquence and excellent articles. He is a person who speaks well and writes well. On important occasions such as international conferences, commemorative celebrations, opening ceremonies, etc., as long as Jin Gong is present and he opens the mouth of Jin, both the guest and the host will be happy and everyone will be moved. Jin Yaoji&#39;s eloquence is not just about his brilliant tongue and spitting jade. What is unmatched is his humor, his wit, his ability to talk and laugh freely, as if everything in the world is ready at any time. As long as he waved and nodded, he would arrange the formation and send the generals out in formation. I remember one time, Professor Jin was going to the city to host a banquet. In the car, he asked me a few questions casually and got a brief grasp of the information about the guests. As a result, he used it vividly in his speech at the banquet. After my country&#39;s first astronaut Yang Liwei successfully launched into space, Principal Jin quoted the words &quot;feeling good&quot; on different occasions, but he used it just right every time and the effect was amazing. Another time, the Department of Translation held an international seminar and invited Jin Gong to preside over the opening ceremony. He asked me to draft the lecture notes in advance. On the opening day, Jin Gong came as scheduled and spoke according to the script. Halfway through the reading, he suddenly said: &quot;I did not write this elegant speech, it was drafted by Jin Shenghua.&quot; He was humorous, calm and comfortable, It can be seen. The most recent one was a speech at the launch of my new book (&quot;Heart-to-Heart-Eighteen Years with Brigitte Lin&quot;) on September 24, 2022. On that day, Shanheng College of Chinese University held a dialogue between Qingxia and I. During the meeting, Jin Gong was specially invited to make comments after the conversation. As soon as he came on stage, he asked the audience seriously if they could take off their masks. At that time, Hong Kong was still implementing epidemic prevention measures. Of course, it was not possible. So, he went on to say: &quot;It doesn&#39;t matter if I don&#39;t take off the mask. Brigitte Lin wears a mask. Everyone will suffer a lot.&quot; .&quot; As soon as this statement came out, it immediately caused a roar of laughter and heated up the atmosphere of the entire venue. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I also remember that at the dinner of the Second Global Chinese Youth Literature Award in 2003, President Jin once said that the stars were shining that night, and stars of both big and small literary genres descended on CUHK. , Bai Xianyong, Yu Guangzhong, Lin Wenyue and other famous artists, as well as many minor literary stars such as the young students who won awards in each group. In fact, President Jin himself is an out-and-out literary star. On the one hand, he writes books and lectures in the field of sociology to teach future generations; on the other hand, he writes narratives and expresses his feelings in the field of literature. During his visit to the University of Cambridge in 1975, Professor Jin was impressed by the aura and beauty of Cambridge. In addition to writing major works, he also began to write short prose pieces. During his one year at JNU, through rain, fog, snow, spring, summer, autumn and winter, Professor Jin’s inspirational words came out and he completed the book &quot;Cambridge Silk&quot;. Ten years later, when he was a visiting professor at the University of Heidelberg, he put his thoughts and feelings into writing and wrote the book &quot;Heidelberg Silk&quot;. The two volumes complemented each other and became a praised &quot;gold-style prose&quot;. In 2007, after Jin Gong retired, he made another trip to his hometown. One of them was a pilgrimage to Dunhuang, the desert art capital. After returning, he published the book &quot;Dunhuang Silk&quot;, which echoed and connected the previous two volumes of &quot;Yu Silk&quot;. It is the work of the three famous &quot;Yusu&quot; sisters. Looking at Professor Jin&#39;s life, he could not only use a huge pen like a rafter, but also use the dignity of a mountain to write large articles about governing the country and criticizing the current ills, which are very resonant to read. , the true feelings of the world come from the heart, and it is deeply touching to read. No matter whether it is a masterpiece or a short piece, there is emotion in the theory, and reason in the emotion. The two blend together without leaving any trace. The author looks down at the heaven and the earth, travels between China and the West, traces the past, discusses the present, and explores the secrets. He can not only analyze and find out the clues in the vast sea of ​​knowledge, but also find new ways and write strange works in the literary world where hundreds of flowers are blooming. . The reason is actually closely related to his personal qualities, endowments, temperament and character. In addition to his professional field, Professor Jin has a profound understanding of literature, history, philosophy, and education. In addition, he is a reasonable person in life. As the saying goes, &quot;Knowledge of worldly affairs is knowledge, and understanding of human feelings is writing.&quot; Therefore, he can not only talk about poetry and art At that time, he was outstanding, and he was also good at twisting and turning in the intricate tangle of personnel and affairs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Professor Kim Yao-kee has served at CUHK for a total of thirty-four years. During his two years as president, he has experienced many difficult and difficult moments under extraordinary circumstances, including the outbreak of SARS and the government-controlled Fortunately, Principal Jin worked hard and dealt with the accidents such as salary cuts due to capital cuts, and finally overcame the difficulties one by one. During his tenure, President Jin completed many tasks, not only established the School of Law, raised huge donations for the university, and introduced new mechanisms to improve the university&#39;s governance structure. When President Jin took office, he once humorously claimed: &quot;I have a long way to go!&quot; Indeed, two years is not a long time, but President Jin&#39;s achievements in running the school are obvious to all and are highly praised. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the end of June 2004, on the eve of President Jin Yaoji’s retirement, CUHK held a farewell banquet. That night, the house was full of guests and the event was unprecedented. All the guests who were supposed to come came, and unexpected friends also came, including colleagues from all walks of life and departments in the school who usually do not like to have banquets.晚宴举办得十分成功，没有冗长的演讲，没有煽情做作的场面，一切都来得纯朴自然，就像金校长历来的作风。校长致辞时说：“我是中大历来最年轻的院长，也是最年老的校长。大家问我退休后可以干什么？我想，朗奴‧列根（罗纳德·里根）七十一岁才出任总统，我大概还够资格去选总统！”风趣如故，幽默如故，这就是金校长的本色！晚宴举行到半场时，突然出现了众人趋前邀请金校长合影留念的场面：一桌又一桌，秩序井然，自动自发地走上前来，目光中尽显依依不舍的神色，这是从未见过的景象。从校董到秘书，从教授到文员，难分彼此，不论高低，此时此刻，大家心目中只有这位即将离任的金校长，这位温文儒雅、待人宽厚的金校长！ &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;晚宴最后一个节目，是中大校友临时召集成队的歌咏团，为金校长献唱&amp;nbsp;《祝福》一曲。这首由叶倩文原唱的名曲，经才子何文汇教授改编歌词，唱出了众人的心声：“凌云才华人共见，校长金公一谪仙。风趣俊朗待人甚友善，量阔腹中可撑船。行仁能奉献，献出真心感远天。真挚博爱育才没厌倦，万缕春风轻吹温暖。啊！春风春风，他朝再吹我面。轻轻挥手，离别愁深未断。听我细诉，日后要开心不变。有爱妻相伴，又有烟斗，烟圈千串……”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;金校长退休之后，比起过往繁忙的岁月，日子虽过得云淡风轻，却充实依旧，飘逸胜昔。除了著述不断，金公亦勤写书法。金耀基自幼在父亲督导之下，努力练字，然从不言苦。根据他的自述，“我对翰墨之道的探索追求，在我自中文大学退休、七十岁后之事”，因此，雍容自在、迈入古稀之年的金公，不但从心所欲，安享含饴弄孙之乐，也再续童年开始的翰墨之缘，并将之发扬光大，成为传颂一时、脍炙人口的“金字体”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;好友林青霞不断由我口中听闻金公的大名与种种逸闻，再从《明报月刊》不时拜读他的大作和欣赏他的书法，一天，这位求贤若渴的才女，主动提出想跟金校长碰碰面，并向他讨教写作和书法的妙诀。 2021年9月24日，我在上海总会设宴，于是，学术界泰斗和演艺界翘楚终于在彼此互赏的状态下结识了。当天晚上，两人虽然第一次会晤，却有一见如故的感觉，席间青霞谈起了刚学习京剧不久，众友提出要求请她清唱一曲，话犹未了，她却已经爽朗豪迈地站起身来，毫不忸怩地唱起了《苏三起解》（花旦）和《三家店》（老生），金公一听，喝彩之余，以洪亮之声喊出了一句“胆大包天”！全场闻之，不由得嘻哈绝倒，鼓掌大乐！这以后，朋友之间，常以“胆大包天”来形容如今凡事都挥洒自如全力以赴的“拼命三娘”林青霞，而青霞自己，也认为金公的赠言可圈可点，甚至到金公提出要送赠墨宝时，还特地请他提了这几个字，高高悬挂在客厅里。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;不久，金校长又赠送长幅墨宝《将进酒》给青霞，这幅字，写得逸兴遄飞，潇洒灵动，把诗仙李白的名作，衬托得天衣无缝。青霞请美术大师张叔平帮她裱好挂在墙上，日日观赏，谁知道2022年7月，大屋发生“火旺”事件，青霞远在海外，当时系念的不是珠宝衣物等身外之物，而是担心在熊熊烈火滚滚浓烟之下，墙上悬挂的《将进酒》是否安然无恙？说也奇怪，&amp;nbsp;那场三级烈火，烧毁了名画，烧毁了家具，然而一到《将进酒》之前，却戛然而止，一墙之隔，&amp;nbsp;偏偏没有烧到墙后青霞房中的书画和衣服。事后，金耀基叹息道：“我就知道林青霞水火不侵，林青霞就是林青霞！”林青霞则认为金公的墨宝是镇宅之宝，有防火御灾的神功。看到他们两人彼此赞赏，互相夸耀，不由得感到这两人之间惺惺相惜的情谊，多么雅致而有趣！如今，《将进酒》已经移居至青霞的半山书房，凡有文人雅士到访，女主人必会邀之在金公的这幅墨宝前留影纪念。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/06/7P5xu1ZxGrNU2GLBli9suXEklp1ioo8P57XHwFiU.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/06/7P5xu1ZxGrNU2GLBli9suXEklp1ioo8P57XHwFiU.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;257176&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;林青霞与金耀基在《将进酒》前合影。 &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（资料图/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;新冠肆虐，三年来疫情严峻，金校长却泰然自若，处变不惊，夫人元祯更是气定神闲，说道：“生死有命，怕也无益！”金校长则继续追求生活美学，自谓：“美食、美酒也从不肯刻意避让。在危危乎疫情中，若得良朋知己共醉，一举杯，便是人生！”如此胸襟，如此境界，与洒脱的东坡居士，亦不遑多让矣！ &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;本家金耀基，人如其名，在众友心目中，恰似一道金晖，暖暖照耀着周围的一切。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 07 Nov 2023 18:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[业委会成员向开发商索要好处费：监督业委会还需业主亲力亲为]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260056]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-07 17:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Recently, two members of the owners’ committee of a residential area in Guang’an, Sichuan, demanded 130,000 yuan in benefits from the developer, suspected of illegal The crime of accepting bribes by a state employee was investigated by the public security department. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is reported that Chen Moubing was elected as the director of the first owners committee of a community in Guang&#39;an with high votes, and Chen was appointed as the security coordination committee member and greening and sanitation committee member. At the end of May 2020, the government inspected the commercial buildings in the community and prepared to build a kindergarten. However, the developer of the community had set up some of the houses on the fourth floor as property offices and property committee offices. Chen Moubing found the developer of the community and asked for a benefit fee of 130,000 yuan, claiming that You can ask the property management committee, owners, etc. to agree to the office relocation. In June 2020, after the developer negotiated with Chen Moubing about the office relocation, he paid 80,000 yuan to Chen Moubing and 50,000 yuan to Chen Moubing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The actions of Chen Bing and Chen have violated the provisions of Article 163 of the Criminal Law of the People&#39;s Republic of China and are suspected of accepting bribes by non-state personnel. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For 130,000 &quot;benefits&quot;, Chen Bing and Chen were able to turn a commercial building in the community into a kindergarten. This shows that as members of the property committee, they have considerable &quot;power&quot;. Several key points remain to be clarified in this case. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First, Article 30 of the &quot;Sichuan Provincial Property Management Regulations&quot; promulgated by Sichuan Province stipulates that the owners&#39; committee shall regularly announce the following information and information to the owners in the property management area: the use and operation of the common parts of the property Income and expenditure status. Has the owners&#39; committee announced relevant information to the owners&#39; meeting as soon as possible regarding the relocation of neighborhood committees and owners&#39; offices and the conversion of original houses into kindergartens? Have the owners reviewed this? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, if Chen Bing and Chen deliberately delayed or even concealed the report, it would be difficult to guarantee the community owners’ right to know about this important matter. This involves the second issue. According to the &quot;Guiding Rules for Owners&#39; Meetings and Owners Committees&quot; promulgated by the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development, the owners&#39; committee is elected by the owners&#39; meeting and consists of an odd number of 5 to 11 people. Why did the other members of the property committee, who accounted for the majority, not raise any objection to this decision and let Chen Moubing and Chen make the decision? This also reflects the inaction of other owners committee members. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This points to a deeper question: Who will supervise the owners&#39; committee? The owners&#39; committee is the embodiment of community autonomy. Within the property management area, all owners form an owners&#39; meeting and elect the owners&#39; committee as the executive body of the owners&#39; meeting. However, the establishment process of the owners&#39; committees has been interfered with or even manipulated, and after the establishment of the owners&#39; committees, it has been reduced to a private area for a few members to seek personal gain. Such incidents have occurred frequently, making the independence and impartiality of some owners&#39; committees almost impossible. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As far as employment committee elections are concerned, some developers or property companies, in order to protect their own interests, interfere, block or even manipulate the elections of owners&#39; committees. The community where I live held a general election for the property owners committee this year. Unfortunately, the surrounding shop owners, who accounted for nearly 10% of the total property area of ​​the community, did not cast a single vote despite being notified and invited multiple times. This resulted in this The first general election failed to meet the requirement that &quot;owners accounting for more than two-thirds of the exclusive area participate in the vote&quot;, and the new property committee was therefore difficult to produce. Some owners who participated in the preparations for the new property committee reported that the property management company promised to reduce the rent to the shop owners in exchange for the other party not participating in the voting. The purpose was to hinder the election of the property committee. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Even if a homeowners committee is finally established through numerous obstacles, community owners will face more challenges. Since the owners&#39; committee exercises part of the power of the owners&#39; meeting, once it lacks professional ethics and sense of responsibility and only focuses on its own interests, regardless of the rights and interests of other owners, it will inevitably use public tools for private use. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Looking at the ways in which owners&#39; committee members guard against self-stealing, there are roughly three types. First, turn public maintenance funds into your own “money bag”. According to a report by Beijing Evening News in 2018, owners of Zhujiang Junjing Community in Beijing reported that more than 4,000 yuan was spent on their public maintenance fund accounts as early as 2013 without any knowledge. Some owners also discovered that their public maintenance funds had been misappropriated. to the owners committee account. The owners&#39; committee said that this move was for everyone&#39;s benefit and investment, and it was not made public because it was afraid that someone would come to &quot;pick trouble.&quot; But this argument is unconvincing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The second method is to &quot;expand financial resources&quot;, fully developing and commercializing various public facilities in the community, so that the profits that should be shared by all owners can be divided between the members of the property committee and the property management. &quot;Chongqing Evening News&quot; reported in 2010 that the property management company of Dibochundun Community in Shipingqiao, Jiulongpo District signed a contract with the property owners committee, and the public revenue was divided &quot;30-70&quot; (30% for the property owners committee and 70% for the property management party), but many The owner was unaware. In addition, the director of the owners&#39; committee also receives a monthly remuneration of 3,000 yuan from the property. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The third method is to reach out to the property company for replacement. Members of the owners&#39; committee use the excuse of changing the property to make the existing property company pay &quot;protection fees&quot; to them, or to replace it with a new property company that has an interest in them, thereby making a profit. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Looking at many cases, we can conclude that the moral self-discipline of owners’ committee members is unreliable and third-party supervision is indispensable. According to Article 39 of the &quot;Sichuan Provincial Property Management Regulations&quot;, if the decisions made by the owners&#39; meeting or the owners&#39; committee violate laws and regulations, the sub-district office (township people&#39;s government) or county (city, district) people&#39;s government where the property is located shall Within thirty days from the date of receipt of the complaint or discovery, the urban and rural development department shall make a decision in accordance with the law and notify all owners. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, as the owners of the community, the majority of owners must also realize that autonomy is not only a right, but also a manifestation of responsibility and ability. Owners should spend more time and energy to actively participate in community governance and strengthen the supervision and management of owners&#39; committees through election of owners&#39; committees, participation in owners&#39; meetings, and formulation of management regulations. At the same time, for major community matters announced by the property owners committee, such as public benefits, etc., professional auditing agencies can also be hired to audit, so as to effectively protect their own rights and interests and improve the quality of the community with stronger public awareness and legal concepts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is the author&#39;s personal opinion only and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot; https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style= &quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 07 Nov 2023 17:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[入职两个多月，00后班主任留遗书自杀，班级管理该不该单独设岗？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260099]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-07 16:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 07 Nov 2023 16:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[独居者老死在家中怎么办？用智能水表监测是一大创新]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260072]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-07 15:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;What to do when people living alone get old is a long-standing topic. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some netizens said that some streets in Shanghai do this: collect information on elderly people living alone in the jurisdiction, and if the household has no water within a few days, they will come to check. This innovation is gradually spreading in aging communities. Other netizens added that Shanghai began to install smart water meters after a series of elderly people died alone in their homes and were found to be smelly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Their words caused a burst of sighs. Some netizens said bluntly that they were hurt in their hearts after reading the relevant content. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This statement is not based on imagination, but is supported by news reports. Regarding the death of an old man without anyone knowing, here is an example: In December 2021, a news piece about &quot;an old man living alone in Shanghai died for many days and was discovered by firefighters&quot; attracted attention. According to neighbors, the old man is a native of Shanghai and is in his seventies. When the neighbor comes back from get off work every day, the old man will greet him, but he has not seen the old man for 5 days. I smelled a bad smell recently and called the police. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This kind of thing is not unique to Shanghai, it has happened in many places. For example, in November 2015, an old man surnamed Pei in Huangshi, Hubei Province, who had never been married and lived alone for many years, was found dead in the bathroom of his home. His body had turned into a pile of bones. According to media reports, the elderly man disappeared six years ago. Community workers and police worked with the deceased’s relatives to search for him but failed. The local Dongchu Evening News reported that “a 70-year-old man has disappeared from the world for more than a year.” Conducted special news reports on the topic. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This type of innovation is not unique to Shanghai. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Regarding the installation of smart water meters, CCTV&#39;s &quot;News 1+1&quot; reported in December 2020 that Jiangsu Road Street, Changning District, Shanghai, installed smart water meters for 6 elderly households living alone in the area. If the reading is less than 0.01 cubic meters within 12 hours, the neighborhood committee will immediately receive the signal and send someone to check it in time. It was on a pilot basis at the time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since then, such practices have appeared frequently in various places. For example, in May 2021, the Beijing Daily client reported that 25 elderly households living alone in the Red House Community in Nanyuan Street, Fengtai District used smart water meters with automatic alarms for free. If the water meter reading is less than 1 liter within 12 hours, the information will be fed back to the neighborhood committee, and someone will come to visit. In addition, smart mattresses, smart light sensors and smart one-button alarms can capture information about the daily activities of elderly people living alone. Once an abnormality is discovered, the back-end staff will promptly contact the community and the elderly&#39;s family members to provide safety protection for the elderly living alone and the disabled elderly. In July 2022, the website of the People&#39;s Government of Haishu District, Ningbo, Zhejiang published this news: &quot;Water Meter Butler&quot; to protect elderly people living alone is online. Abnormal water consumption will automatically alarm 24 hours a day to protect safety. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On August 16, 2023, Foshan Sanshui Foshui Water Supply Co., Ltd. launched the Sanshui District’s “Political and Public Conduct Hotline-Dialogue on People’s Livelihood” program. The company said: We have monitored that elderly people living alone use water When the data volume is abnormal, the grid staff of the village or neighborhood committee will be contacted. For example, if an elderly person used 0.5 cubic meters of water one day and no water the next day, we will recognize this change and notify the grid operator at the residence of the elderly person living alone to contact the civil affairs department and go to the scene to contact the elderly person. Make connections to see if there are any abnormalities in water use or other aspects. We hope that by monitoring water usage, the lives of elderly people living alone can be helped. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It’s cryptic, but you know the meaning. News reports use suggestive and evocative language to describe objective facts. Relatively speaking, netizens’ vernacular is more shocking. But no matter how you express it, the core of the truth is indeed so bleak. For an elderly person living alone, it is not surprising that once his health has problems and no one is around to take care of him, his later life will be miserable. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The author has talked about the importance of having children in many articles. Whether you have children or not, the outcome is very different. That kind of blood and spiritual connection cannot be replaced by any instrument. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, even if you have children, there may still be problems with the elderly living alone and the children not visiting the elderly often. The children of the aforementioned elderly people living alone in Shanghai live in the outer suburbs. The old man passed away, and the children didn&#39;t know about it. It can be seen that they haven&#39;t visited him for many days. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are many reasons why children and the elderly are separated and lack of care for the elderly. For example, some children are extremely busy at work or start a business in other places. As for the elderly who do not want their children to disturb their lives due to differences in interests, temperaments, and cognitions, there are many examples. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But more importantly, the Chinese family structure of three generations and four generations living under one roof has long been impacted by many trendy concepts, such as &quot;separating children and the elderly is more conducive to harmonious relationships&quot; and &quot;children and children living together harmoniously.&quot; The elderly live separately but keep a bowl of hot soup away.&quot; In this context, it is an indisputable fact that more and more elderly people live alone. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;No matter what factors cause the elderly to live alone, it is indeed a worrying social problem for the elderly to live alone and be temporarily or permanently &quot;forgotten&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;How to solve it? It is a proposition worth examining that the elderly and their children should live together as much as possible. Of course, taking into account various practical problems, &quot;living together&quot; should include the option of &quot;living nearby&quot; for children and the elderly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Singapore attaches great importance to promoting this &quot;project&quot;. For a long time, in order to encourage children to live with the elderly, the government has provided conveniences and discounts to families living with the elderly in HDB flats, such as when allocating government flats. Price discounts and priority arrangements will be given to families with three generations living under one roof. In addition, a series of subsidy programs have been launched to provide elderly care and medical subsidies to low-income families supporting the elderly to reduce their family burden. This move increases the enthusiasm of young people and the elderly to live together. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order for family care to become the main way to provide for the elderly, policy promotion is essential. In November 2021, the &quot;Opinions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council on Strengthening the Work on Aging in the New Era&quot; was released, emphasizing the need to improve the elderly care service system, innovate the home and community elderly care service model, and based on home care, through new construction, renovation, leasing, etc. Community elderly care service capabilities. Adult children are encouraged to live nearby or together with their elderly parents to fulfill their support obligations and assume care responsibilities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is worth mentioning that relevant surveys show that 58.51% of adult children are willing to live with the elderly. This ratio gives people confidence. It is not difficult to realize the vision of &quot;living together&quot; for children and the elderly on a larger scale when they are trying their best to shoulder the responsibilities and obligations of providing for the elderly, and with the help of good governance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 07 Nov 2023 15:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[中产三宝拉夫劳伦不香了，年轻人开始走“没钱风”]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260078]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-07 14:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 11/06/0d38a337b2acadb1e7320d558b846b73.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;952&quot; height=&quot;636&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/ 23/11/06/0d38a337b2acadb1e7320d558b846b73.png&quot; data-key=&quot;257148&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span>;（IC photo / picture）&lt; /span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;It is said that the middle class has three treasures: Ralph Lauren, lululemon and Archaeopteryx. But recently, Ralph Lauren, one of the three treasures of the middle class, has begun to lose its sales. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The financial report for the first quarter of fiscal year 2024 shows that as of July 2023, Ralph Lauren’s sales increased by only 0.4% compared with the same period last year. North America performed poorly, with revenue down 10%, and growth in the European market also slowed. Overall, the performance in the past two years has been slightly weak. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Then the question is, as a classic representative of &quot;rich style&quot;, Ralph Lauren was once considered a must-have for the middle class. How did the miracle of Ralph Lauren&#39;s rise be explained? Created? How did it gradually come down from the altar? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&lt;span>;Ralph Lauren and Old Money Style&lt;/span>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In 1967, Ralph Lauren was founded by Ralph Lauren was founded in the United States and is positioned as a designer brand full of American classics and British style. In the early days, by sponsoring popular films such as &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; and &quot;Annie Hall,&quot; Ralph Lauren successfully bound itself to the &quot;American Dream.&quot; In countless American literature, &quot;models dressed like Ralph Lauren&quot; ” is another expression of becoming a superior person. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The classic polo logo and stand-up collar Polo shirt have conquered many middle-aged men, unified the aesthetics of elite men around the world, and established a firm foothold in their cloakrooms. Ralph Lauren&#39;s Polo shirt is as classic as jeans are to Reeves, and down jackets are to Bosideng. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In addition, long-lasting Ralph Lauren classic items such as cable-knit sweaters and Oxford cloth shirts are popular all year round, which can be said to be an effortless way to look old money. A styling tool that sells well all over the world. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Speaking of the &quot;old money style&quot; that made Ralph Lauren out of the industry, why are the new middle class so attracted to it? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>; &quot;Old money&quot; is a concept opposite to the &quot;new middle class&quot;. They are often people who were born in Rome and have been rich for several generations. They are known as the royal family. Most of them are nobles or wealthy businessmen, and they are in a class that is beyond the reach of ordinary people. And their dressing sense shows distinctive characteristics. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The overall style is mostly basic, with silhouette-based clothing styles, classic and timeless designs, brand logos that are not deliberately displayed, and fabrics that look expensive. What matters is high-end and quality. The happiness of rich people is so unpretentious and boring. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The beauty of &quot;old money style&quot; is not piled up, nor is it created by luxury goods, but is enduring after time, calm retro and A solemn elegance, noble and unassuming, low-key but deeply rooted in people&#39;s hearts. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;As Paul Fussell said as early as the 1980s in his sociological work &quot;Style: Social Class and Lifestyle&quot;: In appearance, housing , consumption, leisure, furnishings, spiritual life, language and other aspects of realization will reflect different social levels. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Because machine-made consumer products are so perfect that their high-profile and cheapness can be recognized at a glance, and colors with grayscale components that deviate from the machine have become the center of attention. The favor of the upper class. “The softer and darker the color, the more classy it is.” “Low-key is a common tendency.” &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The behavior of being covered in luxury goods with logos, wanting to wear the most valuable possessions on your body, and showing off your money and power to others is what the old money do. Disdainful, with the aura of rich people and nouveau riche, too exaggerated and flashy, and appearing to be using too much force. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The unified and harmonious color system, clean and simple clothes, on the contrary, look noble and elegant, with a natural sense of relaxation, and show off effortlessly. sense of fashion. This is the essence of old money style, which is simple and low-key, but has texture and looks full of nobility without any effort. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Ralph Lauren is at the forefront of this old money style. At first glance, it looks ordinary among the crowd, but at a closer look, the brand&#39;s logo reveals its identity and status. It is conveyed in a low-key yet high-profile way, perfectly capturing the middle-aged people&#39;s preference for high-end brands. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Relying on its close ties with the &quot;old money style&quot;, Ralph Lauren successfully captured the American elite, and then embarked on a journey of global expansion, without exception. Let China&#39;s middle class compete for it. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/06/510edbfc3b41bdcca5acf9dfc0526a7d.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;1349&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/06/510edbfc3b41bdcca5acf9dfc0526a7d.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;257145 &quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span>;（IC photo/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&lt;span>; The three treasures of the middle class cannot be loved by young people? &lt;/span>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In the 2007 domestic drama &quot;Struggle&quot;, Tong Dawei wore a Ralph Lauren Polo shirt, which brought this American elite brand into the eyes of a wider range of Chinese people. Since then, Ralph Lauren has begun its own golden age. Through the offline agency model, it has spread all over the country and achieved rapid expansion. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;However, success is also a failure. A large number of stores introduced low-end lines in order to reduce sales, which lowered the brand level. Frequent discounts destroyed consumer trust, and counterfeit goods The proliferation of it on the streets has also caused the brand image to plummet. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Ralph Lauren’s financial reports have changed from the previous highs to continuous declines, and ushered in the darkest moment in 2021. Compared with the peak, revenue fell by 40%. Only 4.4 billion yuan. And due to the impact of the epidemic, half of China’s offline stores have been closed. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;After this, Ralph Lauren began drastic reforms, completely transforming the Chinese market into direct sales, and began high-end and digital transformation. Marketing focuses on KOL and social media, and also launches younger sub-brands. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Nowadays, the trend of &quot;how to dress like a rich girl&quot; is popular among Generation Z. The makeup and clothing of rich girls are flooding the social media at home and abroad, attracting attention. There are many imitators. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;After being immune to the dopamine style, sweet-cool-girl style, and Y2K style, the reincarnation of fashion has returned to the &quot;old money style&quot; style, and young people have begun to get involved. The nostalgic complex of &quot;old money style&quot; has the ultimate pursuit of making oneself dress more luxurious, hoping that one can create a low-key, refined and elegant image to the outside world. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;As a result, Ralph Lauren has gradually begun to win over young people from harvesting the middle-aged three treasures of the middle class. It is worth thinking about that the short-term preference of young people does not make Ralph Lauren confident. . &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Essentially, &quot;old money style&quot; is also a fresh trend. Young people are yearning for another kind of life even though they can&#39;t get it. They can feel it through their outfits. The world of &quot;old money&quot; is a feasible strategy. However, after trying it, they often lose long-term interest, stop trying it and fall in love with it, and the late wavers rush to the next fashion trend non-stop. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Once a representative of the old money style, Ralph Lauren was sought after as a must-have item. However, when the &quot;old money style&quot; lost its popularity, the price increased by 80% in five years. Young people just can’t fall in love with Ralph Lauren. After all, in today&#39;s risk society, young people pursue stability more and are less arbitrary and more rational in spending money. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Basic Polo shirts, which can easily cost three to four thousand a piece, are really hard to get rid of. At this time, I look back and see that the UNIQLO co-branded models and MUJI are really good. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;When the current trend of &quot;no money&quot; begins, and consumption downgrades are accompanied by clothing downgrades, we don&#39;t know how long Ralph Lauren will remain popular in China. What is certain is that &quot;the North Face team was all members last year, the Birdman team was last year, and the Ralph Lauren team is this year.&quot; In the dictionary of fashion, nothing is immortal. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Outfitting is not only a style, but also an expression of personality, so Ralph Lauren is just a symbol. Young people don’t care which brand this symbol is embodied by. , the point is, a way of thinking and attitude towards life that is not influenced by trends. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 07 Nov 2023 14:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[毕业生就业难，企业用工荒，创新国际化办学可破就业“悖论”？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260104]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-07 13:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;January 29, 2023, Haining, Zhejiang, on the production line of a company.

(Visual China/Picture)&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Obviously companies are in short supply of people, why can&#39;t college graduates find jobs?&quot; October 30, 2023, in Zhejiang At the third &quot;Zhejiang University Oriental Forum Haining Sub-Forum&quot; (hereinafter referred to as the &quot;Forum&quot;) held in Haining City, Zhejiang Province, Chen Lijun, a professor at the School of Public Administration of Zhejiang University, raised a &quot;paradox&quot; about employment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;After analyzing millions of employment data of global college graduates on LinkedIn China (LinkedIn), Chen Lijun found that the employment data of the top 100 college graduates in the world&#39;s QS rankings The first-time employment rate (the number of people who choose to work after their first graduation) is close to 80%. In China&#39;s leading universities, this figure is close to 50%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Chen Lijun believes that an important reason for the emergence of the &quot;paradox&quot; is the disconnect between the talent chain and the education chain. &quot;The talents cultivated by schools are not the talents that enterprises need.&quot; , the industrial chain is disconnected from the talent chain, causing employment difficulties and labor shortages to coexist.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;For the county economy, the problem of connecting high-end talents and enterprises may be more serious. Significantly. In Haining, where the forum was held, one local solution was to introduce educational resources. As early as 2013, the Haining Municipal Government reached a cooperation with Zhejiang University and introduced Zhejiang University International College. The goal of the cooperation between the two parties is to establish an international cooperative education model area with the Haining campus of Zhejiang University International College as the main body and linking the entire Haining area. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Today, Zhejiang Haining International Campus has been recruiting students for seven years. Wang Yiming, executive deputy mayor of Haining City, proposed at the forum that the cooperation between Zhejiang University and Haining is &quot;gradually getting better.&quot; &quot;The integration of schools and places, the integration of science and technology, and the integration of industries are getting deeper and deeper, and supporting talent and employment services are also keeping up,&quot; but he also admitted that &quot;it is still difficult to introduce and retain talents.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt; h4>;Innovative international education&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Haining is a county-level city under the jurisdiction of Zhejiang Province, adjacent to the provincial capital Hangzhou and only more than 100 kilometers away from Shanghai. It was once known as the &quot;Leather Capital&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;The problem of human resources is a prominent issue in county development.&quot; Professor Wu Jiebing of the School of Public Administration of Zhejiang University introduced at the seminar that before 2010, he had After conducting research on the leather industry in Haining, companies reported that “it is difficult to attract undergraduate graduates from a prestigious university.” More graduates chose to stay in Shanghai or Hangzhou, where companies have R&amp;D centers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The problem facing Haining is how to gather talents and innovate and develop high-tech industries. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;It was also around 2010 that Chinese universities launched a wave of innovative international education. Duke Kunshan University, New York University Shanghai, Wenzhou-Kean University and other Sino-foreign cooperative universities have been approved for establishment. Interestingly, combined with the previous University of Nottingham Ningbo and Xi&#39;an Jiaotong-Liverpool University, the economically developed Yangtze River Delta region has concentrated half of the Sino-foreign joint universities with independent legal personality. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In 2013, Zhejiang University reached a cooperation with the Haining Municipal Government, and the school’s International Union College settled in Haining. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;International education is closely related to local economic development needs. After analyzing provincial panel data from 1997 to 2019, Li Fengliang, a professor at the Graduate School of Education at Tsinghua University, found that whether it was the number of Sino-foreign cooperative education institutions or the number of projects, there was a significant positive correlation between the scale of Sino-foreign cooperative education and the level of economic development. This shows that the expansion of education opening to the outside world can promote the improvement of economic development levels. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In September 2016, Zhejiang University Haining International Campus officially opened. At the end of the same year, Haining decided to build a new science and technology city based on Zhejiang Haining International Campus, focusing on the three industries of pan-semiconductor, life and health, and modern service industries. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Some scholars once pointed out that international education is a double-edged sword. Hong Chengwen, executive deputy director of the Institute of Higher Education of Beijing Normal University, once compared decorating a house to China. He believes that the internationalization of education is to decorate his own home with the best materials, but the ultimate goal of internationalization of education should be &quot;how to serve other people&#39;s houses and be a house designer.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Qu Lijuan, deputy dean of Zhejiang Haining International Campus, said, &quot;The main task of Zhejiang Haining International Campus is to introduce advanced school running concepts, education models and investment mechanisms. The International Union College has established extensive links with world-class academics, and then empowers local economic development through education, technology, and talents, and the corresponding transformation of scientific and technological achievements must be completed locally.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot; On October 30, 2023, Haining, Zhejiang, the third &quot;Zhejiang University Oriental Forum Haining Sub-forum&quot; roundtable meeting, Chen Lijun, professor of School of Public Administration, Zhejiang University.

(Interviewee/picture)&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;How to retain graduates&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;At the forum, Chen Lijun threw out the question about employment to the participants &quot;Paradox&quot;: On the one hand, college graduates cannot find jobs, and millions of people are going to &quot;take public exams&quot;; on the other hand, companies in the transformation and upgrading period cannot recruit urgently needed talents. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;She believes that the simultaneous emergence of &quot;employment difficulties&quot; and &quot;labor shortages&quot; reflects the disconnect between the talent chain and the industrial chain. &quot;Companies are too short of people.&quot; , I participated in a talent symposium in Hangzhou before, and a company said that there is no shortage of designers, but senior technicians, and they are ready to go to South Africa to introduce them. High-skilled talents (cannot be recruited) should be said between education and the industrial chain The disconnect between them is already serious.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In addition, there is also a disconnect between the education chain and the innovation chain. &quot;The conversion rate of scientific and technological achievements in our domestic universities is only about 6%,&quot; Chen Lijun pointed out, &quot;There are &#39;two skins&#39; between many university campuses and industrial parks.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;In our country, the agglomeration between various innovation elements is still There are certain problems.&quot; Chen Lijun mentioned that a very important feature of global science and technology innovation centers is the high concentration and integration of various innovation elements, including universities, scientific research institutes, enterprises, and various intermediary agencies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;How to solve the integration problem among the talent chain, industry chain, education chain, and innovation chain (referred to as the &quot;four chains&quot;)? Chen Lijun pointed out that one way is to deploy innovation and industrial chains around the talent chain, such as the cooperation model between Zhejiang University and Haining. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In Wang Yiming&#39;s view, talents are the media between the education chain, the industrial chain, and the innovation chain. He introduced that the campus-site cooperation between Haining and Zhejiang University has begun to bear fruit. “In terms of campus-site integration, we have established a campus-site construction committee and an international education cooperation office, and established a science and technology innovation fund for talents to provide institutional and design guarantees. ; In terms of scientific and technological innovation integration, the Hangzhou Bay North Wing Science and Technology Innovation Hub is under construction and is expected to be initially formed in 2025; in terms of industrial integration, we have built 8 industry-education centers with Zhejiang University; in terms of employment support for talents, we have newly built a new hub around the campus international schools and international hotels.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Can innovative international education retain talents and solve the employment paradox? According to data released by the International Union College of Zhejiang University, the further study rate of the college’s first three graduates reached 89.7%, and the overseas further study rate reached 66.2%. Wang Yiming mentioned that it is still difficult to introduce and retain talents. &quot;When will so many of our students for further studies come back? If they can come back to China, it will be the result of successful technological transformation, but what we have seen so far is not very good.&quot; &quot;More.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The related background is that after a wave of terminations of Sino-foreign cooperative education institutions and projects around 2018, international education has picked up.
