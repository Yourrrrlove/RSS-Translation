Although Zhao Rui hit two three-pointers at the beginning and scored a total of 8 points, the Chinese men&#39;s basketball team did not quickly widen the point difference and fell behind 21:29 in the first quarter.

In China, luxury goods sales reached 956 billion yuan, accounting for 38% of the global luxury goods market. Chinese people are still the most important force in global luxury goods consumption. According to the international consulting firm Bain &amp; Company, the personal luxury goods market is expected to grow by 5%-12% in 2023, which is another peak after the record growth in 2022. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Why the global economy is slowing down, but the consumption of luxury goods is not affected at all, and even grows against the trend. This is an interesting question. Moreover, some luxury brands have bucked the trend and raised prices to maintain the competitiveness of their brands. For example, LVMH, Hermès, and Kering Group have all raised prices in the past three years. Among them, LVMH has raised prices more than five times from 2019 to March 2023. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For this phenomenon, American economist Veblen proposed a concept called &quot;conspicuous consumption.&quot; He believes that to obtain and maintain a lasting sense of glory, it is not enough to have money; you must also let others know that you have money. Therefore, the main purpose of conspicuous consumption is not the product itself, but to use this consumption to distinguish oneself from others. For example, if you want to wear a particularly expensive watch, it is obviously not just to tell the time, but also to show off to others and demonstrate your economic status. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For luxury goods, it happens to have such a show-off function. Many times, luxury goods are the buyer’s proof of wealth. At the same time, rising prices make fewer people able to afford it, and those who can afford it feel more superior. This is a bit like the mentality we had when we were young: &quot;I can&#39;t live without what others have.&quot; But when we grow up, this mentality becomes &quot;I don&#39;t want what others have.&quot; I must maintain a certain sense of superiority and cannot let myself be reduced to The level of those people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So what we see is that the higher the price of some luxury goods, the more popular they become, because at this time the higher the functions they show off, the stronger the isolation effect. In 2022, Rolls-Royce only delivered a total of 6,021 cars in about 50 countries around the world. This is the first time in the 118-year history of the Rolls-Royce brand that sales have exceeded 6,000 vehicles. But with this sales volume, they have never worried about survival. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to conspicuousness, luxury goods have several other characteristics. It will place special emphasis on scarcity, such as emphasizing that it is a limited edition, emphasizing the use of precious and scarce materials, or emphasizing the complexity of craftsmanship such as pure handcrafting. In addition, luxury goods also have social attributes and are imitable. People who own the same luxury goods are more likely to recognize each other and form a circle. People are also happy to imitate the lifestyle of people of a higher class than themselves. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The consumption of luxury goods is not only an economic issue, but also a social issue. The so-called luxury brand is a modern concept, but luxury goods themselves are not exclusive to modern people. Even in primitive societies or today&#39;s primitive tribes in the Amazon rainforest, their leaders will be different from other people in their clothing. These clothing decorations are symbols of their status and power. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For a long time in human history, luxury goods were mainly linked to power rather than wealth. The &quot;etiquette&quot; of Confucianism is a direct reflection. There are clear regulations on what clothes, clothes and etiquette should be worn by monarchs and ministers, fathers and sons, and different social classes. All must follow the rules without chaos. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Only in modern times, with the process of industrialization and the prosperity of material production, the social form has generally shifted from a power society to a market society. The level of consumption is gradually decoupled from power and linked to the level of wealth. The role of luxury goods has gradually changed from a symbol of power to a symbol of wealth. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, luxury goods have always shown their top-down characteristics. It can be said that they have always been at the top of the aesthetic order, defined and spread by the upper class of society. In societies where the original power order was stronger, this power of definition came from the top of the hierarchy. In modern society, this aesthetic definition also comes from the top, but it is more reflected in the conceptual design of companies or designers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;企业家不断挖掘人们更深层次、更丰富多样的需求，然后市场在不断分层过程中形成分化，处于顶端的便是今天的众多奢侈品品牌。豪车名表、钻石翡翠，豪华品牌的衣服鞋子、化妆品，应有尽有，处处通过品牌和调性，彰显个性和身份的不同。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;富人或权贵通过奢侈品给自己贴上标签，既不能脱离这个圈层，也不能让别人随随便便进入这个圈层，这样才能维系他们的社会地位。所以即便奢侈品涨价，只要还在他们的承受范围之内，他们也会毫不手软，眼睛都不眨一眨。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;不过这种奢侈品文化的形成，也满足了部分普通人的幻想，误以为拥有了一个名牌包包、高档的衣服，就真的跨入了那个阶层。这个时候，奢侈品就成为一个阶层靠近另一个阶层的道具。有时候这个道具是有用的，但很多时候其实作用不大，只是一种被刻意引导的高消费需求罢了。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我们都知道，造假要造全套，一个谎言需要用另外一百个谎言来圆。同样，挎上了名牌包包，身上的其他行头就不能太寒酸；而一身名牌，车也不能太一般。这些东西叠加起来，如果不是真有一定的财力，恐怕真要打肿脸充胖子了。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;年轻人需要当心这种精心构造的幻象，不要被奢侈品文化牵着鼻子走。很多时候，并不是你拥有一个名牌包包，别人就一定会高看你一眼。这些东西也许对建立第一印象有帮助，但更重要的是包包背后的那个人，其真实实力怎么样。高手过招，三两句话可能就知道对方深浅，而不会轻易被那些身外之物所迷惑。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;其实任何个人和社会经济体一样，一个社会想要发展经济，都必然要经过储蓄和投资的阶段。一个年轻人想要成就自己，到达一个更高的平台，更多时候也需要储蓄和投资自己，蓄势待发。名牌包包作为奢侈品，可以作为一定的手段，但它不应成为最终的目的和目标。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;

&lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;2023年9月6日，浙江湖州，长兴县吕山乡中心小学，学生在捉迷藏。&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（视觉中国/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;因为从事教育媒体工作，旅美教育学者、迈阿密大学亚洲/亚-美研究学科部原主任黄全愈的文章，我从2014年读到2023年，仍时时有不同感受。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“教育”其实有非常复杂的维度，从不同维度触及教育的问题，看待教育的方式就会完全不同。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我最初从事的教育媒体，是面向家长讨论教育话题的类型。那时我对教育的困惑，或是反思，完全出自一种家长立场：为什么孩子会在教育中受苦？为什么家长会如此焦虑？如果教育就是要在一条漫长的逆流中，通过自我压抑与不断刻苦来安放“不被淘汰”的恐慌感，那么这条路走到尽头，我们的孩子会成长为什么样的人？&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在这样一种立场中，黄全愈的文章给我打开了一扇窗：也许有一种教育的范式，它主张孩子自由、快乐、散乱，但也有很好的成果，而且这种自由与成果的关系还并非“无心插柳”，而是有着与我们的认知完全不同的教育学内涵。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这是他的文章给我的第一种“读法”：教育有不同的视角。那么第二层的维度随之而来——我们可以学吗？&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我们的确学了很多新概念，比如STEM、PBL项目式学习、跨学科、大概念、元认知、探究式学习，等等。伴随着这些新概念的涌入，我自己也经历了一些转型，从面向家长的媒体，转向面向教育政策研究、学校组织或战略研究的专业媒体，因为我实在很好奇，家长抱怨和质疑的问题，学校到底怎么看？在各种试图“优化”教育的概念旋涡之中，学校到底在做些什么？&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一脚踏进专业领域，我很快发现，学校可能比家长还要无奈，还要无辜。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;今天的学校确实处于两难之中。一方面，素质教育喊了几十年，最近两三年演变成“素养”教育：2022年4月国家发布义务教育新课标，对学生素养的描述与要求，与全球最领先的教育理念基本一致。也就是说，无论在教育理想层面，还是在教育政策落实层面，我们的教育看起来都要向他所描述的那种景象靠拢了。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;问题在于“另一方面”。我们的学校教育，在每一个节点都要考试。考试本身并不是一个问题，但考试的结果是一张门票，它决定一个孩子接下来将进哪一扇门，走哪一条路。也许对95后、00后而言，“门与路”的意义都不再有70后、80后那种决定命运的意义，但一种惯性的社会心态不这样想，反而为考试赋予了更刻板的意义：为了考高分而教育，为了不丢分而学习。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;素养与考试矛盾吗？这其实是一个很难想明白的问题。难道素养的发展不需要评估阶段性结果，不需要考试吗？不是的。黄全愈在他的文章中明确说，他不是反对考试，而是反对“应试思维”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当考试只是一种学业评估时，它就好像是学生自己发出去的一张调查表，收回来看看自己还要在哪些方面发力，哪些方面需要寻求帮助解决问题。而应试思维实际上是一种评判思维，它由老师、家长、学校、社会……总之除了学生自己之外的一切人发出来，然后决定你是个成功的学生，还是个失败的学生。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;作为由教育专业人士构成的组织，学校并非不了解素养学习与应试思维之间发生的抵牾，但问题在于，学校也必须做一道不由它自己发出来的试题，比如这样一个典型问题：“你们做项目式学习（或是素质教育、跨学科学习等），可以让学生成绩更好吗？”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这个问题看起来还挺合情合理，对不对？事实上，这个问题足以把一所有理想、有情怀，希望做点儿教育变革的学校打翻在地。因为一旦考试、分数、成绩成为“素养”的准则，那么把学生“养”出来的那种从容、耐心、支持、接纳的教育心态就会一扫而空。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;追求结果的应试思维，本质上需要一些“反人性”的操练，比如机械化的准确率、高密度的时间管理，都需要这种操练。而素养需要的是一种生态，尊重孩子生长的节律，可能在很长一段时间内看起来无所作为，但成长最终会走向“自然熟”。然而，升学考试随时可以切断自然节律。无数例子告诉我们，在一种确定性的寻求中，孩子的天性和意志，成了最轻易被忽略的一环。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在教育内卷这件事上，利弊是很容易看清楚的，难的是取舍。对，孩子很苦，但孩子上了985；或是“你们都&#39;素质&#39;去吧，留我家孩子悄悄刷题”；学校也是一样，“家长只认升学率，所以升学率就是王道”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;教育的症结，正如黄全愈在谈STEM教育的文章中提到的，“中国教育当前要解决的是素质教育的底色问题，而不是STEM 的具体课程问题”，更不是各种教育概念“加加减减”的问题。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;不断反思教育，最终就难免要接近一个终极问题：教育的意义到底是什么？&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;如果教育是为了让少数孩子出人头地，那我们会迎来一个什么样的社会？如果教育是为了一种社会整体的向善与福祉，那么这样道德理想式的教育，对“我家的孩子”又有什么好处？&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;因为工作领域，我会看到各种各样的教育文章，看多了发现，教育本身存在一种个体与社会的张力。如果你只关注家长立场，看输赢，算得失，“制造焦虑”会是必然结局；而如果只站在专家、学者立场，看理论的推演、教学法的介绍，概念往往不接地气。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;《教育的基础》这本书中，有一句话让我特别有感触：“我们一方面说世界的未来属于孩子，但另一方面，世界却不属于孩子。”为什么这么说？因为我们的教育往往是凭着成年人的策略与计量、想象与设计，去规定孩子的动作。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我最近跟一些专家、校长聊到“拔尖创新人才培养”的话题，这也是接下来的国家人才战略。那么拔尖创新人才培养，会不会成为学校的任务、学生的试题？很有可能。会不会成为新一轮家长焦虑的靶点？也很有可能。那如何避免这种情况发生，而且能在一种积极的环境中实现拔尖创新人才培养呢？&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;黄全愈写得明白：“创造性不是技能，而是潜伏在人的生理和心理层面的特质，教不出来，更遑论训练！”“只有当科学思维盘活科学知识时，知识才是力量。从这个意义上说，&#39;减负&#39;就是要培养科学思维，去减轻长辈的权威和人为的标准给孩子的负担，把死知识激活为青春洋溢的创新动力。”“孩子的智慧不是用来重复别人，而是用来创造自己的！”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这些金句散落在书中。创新本质上是一种破局，破除现有格局去探索未知世界，创新能力不可教，但可以培养，培养方式恰恰是创造环境，让老师“少教”，让孩子探索，然后“多悟”，从碎片化的多悟，变成系统化的认知，形成个性化的判断，最终是创造性的行动。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;教育不是非要逼自己的孩子站在某个不属于自己的潮头。这可以看作这本书的第三种“读法”——从教育中领悟人的价值。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;作者系《看教育EnsightEdu》主编&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;

French-born Mongi Bavandi, American Louis Bruce and Russian-born Alexey Yerkimov were awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry on Wednesday for their research on tiny particles known as quantum dots . &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the afternoon of October 4, 2023, Beijing time, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences announced that the 2023 Nobel Prize in Chemistry Awarded to Moungi G. Bawendi of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Louis E. Brus&amp;nbsp; of Columbia University, and Alexei Ikimo of the Nanocrystal Technology Company of the United States. Alexei I. Ekimov for their contributions to the discovery and synthesis of quantum dots. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;What are quantum dots? &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Quantum dots, also known as semiconductor nanocrystals, are semiconductor crystal particles composed of thousands of atoms that are generally less than 20 nanometers in size. Quantum dots have a specific three-dimensional structure, usually spherical or ellipsoidal. Generally, quantum dots are composed of a &quot;core&quot; made of semiconductor materials such as cadmium selenium or lead sulfide; sometimes the core of the quantum dot is wrapped by another material to form a &quot;shell&quot; ” to improve its optical and electronic properties. Quantum dots are one of the smallest building blocks in nanotechnology. Generally speaking, the properties of an element depend on how many electrons it has. Quantum phenomena appear when matter shrinks to the nanometer scale. This means that the properties of an element will be determined by the size of the substance, not by the number of electrons it possesses. Comprised of just a thousand atoms, a quantum dot is to a football what a football is to the Earth. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1937, physicist Herbert Froehlich predicted that once particles were small enough (so-called nanoparticles), they would be affected by the strange magic of quantum mechanics. . To explain this quantum phenomenon, Judith Giordan, president of the American Chemical Society, told AFP, &quot;Think of it as a small box. When the particle shrinks small enough, the electrons will hit the sides of the box. .&quot; In a larger box, electrons hit the sides less frequently, which means they have less energy. For quantum dots, the larger box emits red light, while the smaller box emits blue light. That means by controlling the size of the particles, scientists can turn their crystals into red, blue and any color in between. But it would be 40 years after Froelich predicted it before anyone could actually observe the phenomenon. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;The great discovery of ultra-small particles&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Quantum dots are a new type of material different from molecules. Due to the effect of quantum mechanics, as long as these nanoparticles are adjusted Their size can change their properties. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1937, physicists speculated that size-related quantum effects might occur in nanoparticles. At the time, however, it seemed impossible to recreate this effect in the real world. To do this, researchers need a perfect crystalline material, and they need to control the size of the nanomaterial very precisely, sculpting it layer by layer, so few believe this research is possible. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But in the early 1980s Ikimov and Bruce respectively proved that it could be done. Ikimov created a size-dependent quantum effect in colored glass. By changing the temperature and heating time of the molten glass, he found that he could change the size of the resulting particles. The smaller the particles, the bluer the light they emitted. This colorful experiment allowed Ikimov to successfully achieve size-dependent quantum effects in colored glass. His experimental results proved that the size of nanoparticles can control the properties of materials through quantum effects, laying the foundation for subsequent research and applications. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At about the same time, Bruce became the first to discover this colorful quantum effect in liquid solutions, demonstrating the size and color of nanoparticles floating freely in solutions and gaseous compounds. the relationship between. These findings have sparked intense interest in how these tiny dots can be exploited for a variety of applications. Bruce also became the first scientist to demonstrate that free-floating nanoparticles have size-dependent quantum effects. His research provides important experimental evidence for understanding and exploiting the quantum properties of nanoparticles and advances the development of nanotechnology. His work has broad application prospects in fields such as electronics, optics and biomedicine. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But for quantum dots to be truly useful, you need to be able to make them in solution and precisely control their size. In 1993, Bawendi revolutionized the chemical production of quantum dots in his lab at MIT. He developed a method to precisely control the rate at which crystals grow in solution and figured out how to stop the crystals when they reached the desired size. He first injected chemical reagents into the solution to instantly form tiny crystals, and then quickly adjusted the temperature of the solution to prevent their growth. Bawendi revolutionized the chemical production of quantum dots, which greatly improved their quality and paved the way for their use in a variety of applications. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Wide application prospects&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Quantum dots are a representative material of the &quot;size effect&quot; of nanomaterials. They are used in more and more fields. It has been applied more widely and deeply, from optoelectronic devices to photocatalysis to biological detection, almost covering people&#39;s current and future daily life needs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Quantum dots are now glowing in computer monitors and television screens based on quantum light-emitting diode technology. They also add nuance to the light of some LED lights, and are used by biochemists and doctors to map biological tissue. Quantum dots, for example, make it possible to change the color of LED lights very precisely and significantly increase their efficiency. The glowing fluorescent dots are injected into the body and attach to immune cells that aggregate into cancerous tissue, helping surgeons distinguish tumors that are even hard to see. Tuning the ability to absorb different wavelengths of light could also create customized solar cells that are highly efficient in different situations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Quantum dots have brought huge benefits to mankind. In the future, they could contribute to flexible electronics, tiny sensors, thinner solar cells and encrypted quantum communications, so we&#39;re just beginning to explore the potential of these tiny particles. Through the selection and issuance of the 2023 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, we can find that the Nobel Prize Committee not only pays attention to past contributions, but also pays attention to the possible impact of a discovery on the future. The ability to modulate nanoparticles by changing their size or surface properties could lead to a variety of as yet unexplored possibilities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 07 Oct 2023 18:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[江西省人大常委会原党组副书记、副主任殷美根被“双开”]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258198]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-07 17:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;span>;With the approval of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection and the State Supervision Commission reviewed the former deputy secretary of the Party Leadership Group of the Standing Committee of the Jiangxi Provincial People’s Congress , Deputy Director Yin Meigan conducted a case review and investigation on serious violations of disciplines and laws. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After investigation, Yin Meigan lost her ideals and beliefs, deviated from party principles, had no sense of discipline and law, resisted organizational review, and engaged in superstitious activities; ignored the spirit of the eight central regulations, accepted gifts and money in violation of regulations, and entered and exited Private clubs; failing to report personal matters as required, failing to explain problems truthfully when organizing interviews and correspondence; borrowing money and housing from management and service recipients, being morally corrupt, and engaging in power, sex, and money transactions; violating regulations and intervening in market economic activities. and disciplinary and law enforcement activities; neglecting the education of spouses and children; forming a community of interests with unscrupulous businessmen, collaborating with relatives to engage in power and money transactions, taking advantage of the convenience of one&#39;s position to seek benefits for others in job promotions, project contracting, etc., and illegally accepting Huge amounts of property. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yin Meigan seriously violated the party’s political discipline, organizational discipline, integrity discipline, work discipline and life discipline, constituting a serious job violation and suspected of bribery crime, and did not restrain or stop after the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China. , is serious in nature and has a bad impact, and should be dealt with seriously.

He doesn&#39;t like revising drafts or attending meetings, and he doesn&#39;t endorse or talk about the discourse system that may be a mixture of film screenwriting reference book theory and Internet platform &quot;playing methods.&quot; He didn’t even meet the actors, go to the set, or compare the differences between his script and the final product. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As a writer, I really empathize with his approach: he only does what he wants to do, and doesn’t do anything he doesn’t want to do; at the same time, I feel that he can live in a small world with his own rules. , how difficult it is to make money, and how lucky it is at the same time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;While doing an interview with Director Li Xiaofeng for this topic (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;he has collaborated with Wang Mu several times&lt;/span>; ), I envy that kind of atmosphere even more. Everyone has a consensus on the concept of creation and trusts each other&#39;s personality and talents. This is the basis. On top of this, Li Xiaofeng gave a popular description, &quot;Whoever holds the knife eats the meat.&quot; Whoever writes this draft Write with your own characteristics. We don&#39;t need to be screwed together. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Xiaofeng said that creative freedom is particularly important. It may be unstable, but it can ensure physical and mental health. I can understand what Li Xiaofeng means by &quot;unstable&quot;. &quot;Girl Nezha&quot; and &quot;Rebirth from the Ashes&quot;, which he directed and Wang Mu co-wrote, did not receive particularly high Douban ratings, but I liked them very much. Fully respect everyone&#39;s opinions and creative temperament. The effect may not be good enough, but the participants will definitely feel comfortable and some viewers will also enjoy watching it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Mu and Li Xiaofeng collaborated once more. The script &quot;Hypnotized by Water&quot; written by Wang Mu won a screenplay award at the Busan International Film Festival, but was not filmed due to lack of funds. But of course, success is not the most important, at least not the only valid criterion. At this point, I think their creations have returned to the essence of creation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The interview with Wang Mu did not go as smoothly as I expected. He is not a cinephile director, and I am a layman in theater. When interviewing him himself, after several back and forths, I still couldn’t fully understand what it meant that drama held far more weight in his heart than movies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Peripheral interviews helped me. Li Xiaofeng said that Wang Mu is a serious creator. He likes Chekhov. His novel writing style is very static. There is a bust of Lu Xun in his home. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Xiaofeng also talked about their first collaboration on the script for &quot;Rebirth from the Ashes&quot;. In this play, people in the 2010s have to look back to the 1990s, when ethical relationships changed dramatically and shocks occurred in people&#39;s hearts. The script was previously called &quot;Chasing&quot;, and there were already seven drafts when Wang Mu joined. Xu Feng and Li Xiaofeng, one of the protagonists, have imagined several identities, including repair shop workers, postmen, etc. Wang Mu changed Xu Feng&#39;s occupation to worker. Li Xiaofeng immediately felt that it was accurate, &quot;That movie actually contains a lot of thinking about social forms. Wang Mu wrote Xu Feng as a young man who was greatly affected by family and social changes, and he was also very innocent. He made Xu Feng&#39;s purity and ours The emotions for the working class are unified.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I think of &quot;The Tender Shell&quot; again. Wang Mu looked for image references for the young male and female protagonists who were traumatized and redeemed each other. Dai Chun was Peter Sheff. Allen in &quot;Ikus&quot;, Juexiao is Antigone in the Greek myth written by Sophocles. Li Xiaofeng said that when he watched &quot;The Gentle Shell&quot;, he felt that &quot;there is a little bit of stagnation. The characters in Wang Mu&#39;s works have a relatively high quality and density of souls.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Now that I think about it, as the first work of a young director, it has no popular stars and does not have endless road shows like the movies in the past few months. It can get more than 12 million at the box office, which is pretty good.
