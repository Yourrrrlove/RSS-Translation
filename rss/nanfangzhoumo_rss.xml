One is father, marriage and family; It is private property rights and market economy. Because these two constitute the two indispensable cornerstones of human civilization. Our ability as humans to enter a civilized society really depends on this. This article explores the origin and evolution of these two species from the perspectives of historical genetics and natural evolutionary history. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;Father&quot; is a product of cultural construction&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Scholars in the pre-Qin era realized that in the distant &quot;ancient&quot; period, there was no such role as a father. &quot;Zhuangzi: Robber Zhi&quot; states that &quot;in the days of Shen Nong, the people knew their mothers but did not know their fathers.&quot; &quot;Lu&#39;s Spring and Autumn Annals: Reliance on the King&quot; said: &quot;In ancient times, there were no kings. The people lived in groups and knew each other.&quot; &quot;The mother does not know the father&quot;, that is, there was no father&#39;s role in the &quot;ancient&quot; period, so there was no stable dual family and the corresponding ethics between various relatives. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Professor Wu Fei said that in &quot;Etiquette·Mourning Clothes Biography&quot;, &quot;Shang Jun Shu·Kaisa&quot; and &quot;Lu Shi&quot;, as well as &quot;Jiao Shi Yi Lin&quot;, &quot;Baihu Tong·Hao&quot; and &quot;Lunheng&quot; in the Han Dynasty • Documents such as &quot;Qi Shi&quot; and &quot;He Tu Ting Zuo Fu&quot; all record the situation of &quot;knowing the mother but not knowing the father&quot; in ancient times (Wu Fei: &quot;The &quot;Disintegration&quot; of Human Relations: Anxiety about Family and Country in the Tradition of Moral Theory&quot;, Sanlian Bookstore , 2017, pp. 163–166). As a kind of collective memory, as well as field observations of &quot;savages&quot; in the pre-Qin era, we all realize that the role of fathers comes with the development of civilization. This is a consensus among people since the pre-Qin and Han Dynasties. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Book of the Later Han Dynasty·Xunli Biography&quot; also noted from the perspective of field observation that the people of Luoyue in the south at that time &quot;had no wedding ceremony laws, and they had no suitable match due to their promiscuity and lust.&quot; This state of no stable duality obviously does not produce the role of a father (in a social and cultural sense). Through civilized discipline and education, biological men in nature are transformed into fathers who fulfill family and social responsibilities, thus forming a stable family. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In a stable family structure, bloodline inheritance is clearer, which can encourage fathers to be more actively involved in family and parenting responsibilities. With the father&#39;s active participation, the child&#39;s survival probability is higher, a stable parent-child relationship is formed, and the child can be with the child for a longer period of time. As a role in this pole of civilization, knowledge that requires longer education and accumulation, including hunting, martial arts, farming, and even a large amount of &quot;tacit knowledge&quot; such as managing a tribe, will be taught to students in the original &quot;family learning&quot; way. child. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To borrow the terminology of the Austrian school of economics, the emergence of the father&#39;s role and the dual family, as well as the imagination of the patrilineal ancestral community formed on this basis, are actually the product of super overcoming time preference. In an era without father figures, people consider the time dimension more briefly and often make judgments based on moments or short-term passions. The emergence of the role of the father, as well as the continuation of stable families and families, have made the lines of time extremely long, and people&#39;s investment and gaming models also tend to consider the longer future. At this point, savings become more valuable. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;People saved grain and raised livestock instead of consuming it immediately. Through savings, children can obtain stable property inheritance. The continuation of private property allows people to &quot;have perseverance and perseverance&quot;, overcome time preference, and develop the virtue of accumulating for the future. Whether it&#39;s working hard to save wealth, or doing good deeds to build a family&#39;s reputation, these are the foundations of civilization. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The blood relationship between children and their mothers is natural and does not need to be demonstrated through cultural imagination, but the father is a product of cultural construction and imagination. To imagine community through &quot;patrilineal&quot; requires both the ability to imagine beyond time and abstract cultural construction. Through this model, people who were destined to forget each other in the past can be formed into an imaginary community, creating a close division of labor and collaboration. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Patriline and Aristocracy&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Once this kind of family organization is produced, it is destined to have an extremely powerful advantage among the scattered people everywhere who &quot;know their mother but not their father&quot;. Many archaeological materials can show that the first to establish a stable dual family order was the earliest aristocratic class. Not only did they create the means of imagining and sustaining community through the patriline, but they also created the earliest surnames. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;生&quot; in &quot;surname&quot; is a phonetic symbol. The ancient sound of the word &quot;surname&quot; is in the heart mugeng part, and the archaic sound of the word &quot;生&quot; is in the birth mothergeng part. The dental sounds overlap and the pronunciation is basically the same. Therefore, the word &quot;surname&quot; is not interpreted literally as &quot;born by a woman, representing the maternal line.&quot; The &quot;female&quot; is only used to label women in the paternal family with &quot;surname&quot;, while men in the family use &quot;surname&quot;. The &quot;生&quot; in the surname is just a phonetic symbol, and the &quot;surname&quot; is just a function of distinguishing between patrilineal families with the same origin and non-intermarriage. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The paternal surname creates a long family tree, which can connect different distant family branches, forming a greater ability to mobilize and cooperate. Therefore, it can be seen that early nobles often prohibited civilians from establishing surnames and did not allow them to establish family trees. For example, in ancient Hawaii, &quot;ordinary civilians were not allowed to record their lineages, and they were prohibited from approaching the supreme chief who was a professional person who recorded the noble lineage. This made the chief and the A sharp separation line was formed between civilians&quot; (Chen Chun: &quot;Exploring the Origins of Civilization and Early States: A Comparison of Chinese and Foreign Theories, Methods and Research&quot;, Shanghai Bookstore Press, 2007, p. 246). &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The aristocrats and civilians in the Shang Dynasty&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;From an archaeological point of view, many people in the early days did not have stable paired families, and it was a common phenomenon to not know their mother but their father. For example, in tomb K82.5 at the Wajiaping site of Lintao of the Qijia Culture, an adult woman was buried with a baby under her breast, and the remains of a seven or eight-year-old child. The Qinghai Minhe Lajia F4 abandoned house burial tomb of the Qijia Culture also contains a single woman buried with a child in her arms (Li Xinwei: &quot;Rediscussing the Abandoned House Burial in Prehistoric Period&quot;, &quot;Archaeology&quot; 2007 Issue 5, No. Pages 50-56). These single mothers buried alone with their children are a vivid portrayal of the early era of &quot;knowing your mother but not knowing your father&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the Xiajiadian Dadianzi tombs, there are no couples buried together, and mothers and young children are often buried together. For example, in tomb M30, a mother was buried with two young children, and in M205, a mother was buried with a child. Young children were buried together, M358 was buried with a mother and a child, M675 was buried with a mother and children, M787 was buried with a mother and two infants, and M1246 was buried with a young child (Institute of Archeology, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences: &quot;Dadianzi: Lower Xiajiadian Cultural Sites and Cemetery&quot; Excavation Report&quot;, Science Press, 1998, pp. 228-231). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among the ancient sarcophagus burials of southwestern Yi, there are also tombs in which couples are buried together (Luo Kaiyu: &quot;Research on Sarcophagus Tombs in Western Sichuan and Yunnan and Eastern Tibet&quot;, &quot;Acta Archeology&quot;, Issue 4, 1992, p. 426 ). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After entering early civilization, nobles had stable couples buried together, but civilians still did not have stable couples buried together. For example, the couple&#39;s tombs M303 and M225 of Da Sikong in the Yin Ruins are side by side, 2 meters apart, and they are buried side by side. They are both from the fourth phase of the Yin Ruins, and there are rammed earth buildings on the upper floors (Anyang Working Team of the Institute of Archeology, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences: &quot;Excavation Report of Da Sikong M303 in the Yin Ruins &quot;, &quot;Acta Archeologica Sinica, Issue 3, 2008, p. 388&quot;), this noble tomb has a clear dual relationship. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Meng Xianwu pointed out that two-thirds of the tomb owners in Yinxu did not have a legal spouse during their lifetime. There were not many truly monogamous families. Most of them still lived in unstable couples and incest marriages, so they died. Afterwards, there were no exclusive spouses buried together (Meng Xianwu: &quot;A Review of the Excavations of Tombs in the Southern District of Yin Ruins&quot;, &quot;Central Plains Cultural Relics&quot; Issue 3, 1986, p. 80). Some scholars also pointed out that the phenomenon of &quot;burial in different caves&quot; for stable marriages is rare in the Yin Ruins. Throughout the pre-Qin period, single burials of men and women were the main burial method (Yang Baocheng: &quot;Research on Yin Ruins Culture&quot;, Wuhan University Press, 2002, pp. 80-83). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From these comprehensive points of view, the common people in the Shang Dynasty still mainly lived in a state without stable couple marriages, while the aristocracy showed a relatively stable couple family. In other words, aristocratic families in the Shang Dynasty had a clear role of &quot;father&quot;. The genealogy of the Shang king family in &quot;Historical Records·Yin Benji&quot;, as well as the genealogy of the Shang king family presented in the oracle bone inscriptions, and even other signs of noble genealogy found in the oracle bones, such as the famous &quot;Shang Sanjubing&quot; family tree inscription, are all It shows the ability of the aristocracy at that time to construct a community organization in the cultural imaginary way of patriarchy. Although the ties of the ancient clan society had not yet been completely disintegrated at that time, in the oracle bone inscriptions, the children of the Shang family referred to their biological father&#39;s brothers of the same generation, that is, uncles, as &quot;father&quot; and &quot;fathers&quot;. In addition, the Shang king and queen of Yinxu were also buried in different family cemeteries. &quot;This is probably related to the fact that the blood ties of the clan have not been completely disintegrated.&quot; (Anyang Working Team of the Institute of Archeology, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences: &quot;1976 Northwest Xiaotun, Anyang&quot; &quot;Excavation Briefing&quot;, &quot;Archaeology&quot;, Issue 4, 1987, page 374). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But no matter what, the Shang royal family and other aristocratic families can actually identify their respective biological fathers, and the later the father dies, the more the son succeeds, and the situation of brother&#39;s succession is decreasing. . Among the sacrifices, the sacrifices for the biological father are also more solemn. This also shows that the role of &quot;father&quot; in the culture of the royal family and aristocracy of the Shang Dynasty has become more and more clear, while in contrast is the vague civilian class, the mainstream living situation among which is still knowing the mother but not knowing the father. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Zhou Civilization and Confucius&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;By the Zhou Dynasty, the situation of the civilian class had not changed much, while the civilization level of the aristocratic class had further evolved and improved. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At that time, it was said that &quot;propriety is not inferior to common people&quot;, that is, the aristocratic class maintained the father and stable couple marriage family structure through civilized &quot;propriety&quot;, while the common class continued to know their mother and their father. For example, among the Jin tombs in Chengcun Village, Linyi, Shanxi, among the third-level civilian tombs, couples are rarely found buried in the same cave. &quot;This shows that the burial custom of couples being buried together in caves has not become popular among lower social classes&quot; (Institute of Archeology, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, etc.: &quot;Linyi Chengcun Cemetery&quot;, China Encyclopedia Press, 2003, p. 258 pages). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Scholars pointed out that compared with the Shang Dynasty, it was more common for couples of nobles in the Zhou Dynasty to be buried together in tombs (Zhang Mingdong: &quot;Inspection of Joint Tombs in the Shang and Zhou Dynasties&quot;, &quot;Ancient Civilization&quot; Volume 7, Cultural Relics Publishing Society, 2008, p. 185). This also shows that with the development of ritual and music civilization, the civilizational achievements carried by &quot;rituals&quot; more generally covered the families of the aristocratic class at that time. Stable and clear pair marriages, as well as the role of the father, were the further development of civilization in the Zhou Dynasty. important results. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This background actually helps to understand more deeply why Confucius, who lost his father since childhood, had to hold a grand funeral ceremony at the Five Fathers Road after the death of his mother Yan Zheng, and then put her there. He was buried in Fangshan and buried with his father (&quot;Historical Records·Confucius Family&quot;). Because through this act, he can publicly show that he is the child of the aristocratic Kong family, not a &quot;savage&quot; class without a father, but a low-level nobleman with clear parents buried together in the tomb - a scholar. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As an orphan, Confucius never met his father. In fact, what has the greatest influence on him is precisely the maternal family with natural blood connections, that is, his grandfather Yan Xiang and his mother Yan Zheng are in these maternal families. Among the students of Confucius, there were the &quot;Eight Faces of Confucius&quot;, namely Yan Lu, Yan Hui, Yan Xing, Yan Gao, Yan Zu, Yan Zhimu, Yan Kuai, and Yan He. Among them, Yan Lu was probably his mother&#39;s nephew, that is, Confucius&#39;s cousin in his mother&#39;s family, and Yan Hui, as the son of Yan Lu, was Confucius&#39;s nephew in his mother&#39;s family. Confucius&#39; feelings for Yan Hui were often intertwined with the deep emotions of his mother&#39;s family, and Yan Hui also regarded Confucius as someone as close to him as his father. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In terms of natural emotions, Confucius actually had the closest relationship with his mother&#39;s family, but he knew that the civilized class could not only know its &quot;quality&quot; but not its &quot;culture&quot;. &quot;You love his sheep and I love his etiquette.&quot; Although my father is far away, he is a symbol of etiquette and civilization. Without the symbol of father, he would remain at the level of knowing his mother and not knowing his father. Therefore, Confucius chose to publicly bury his mother and father together, declaring that he was the successor of Uncle Liang He, the official of Zouyi, and inherited and continued his father&#39;s &quot;Kong&quot; surname. The origin of the patrilineal imaginary community can therefore be traced back to the monarchs of the ancient Song Dynasty, and even the more distant Shang royal family, and all the way back to the emperor Ku and other figures in the ancient mythological era. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Confucius&#39; recognition of his ancestors opened a path to encourage the common people to imitate the nobility, to go beyond knowing their mother and not knowing their father, and to establish a clear father&#39;s family like the aristocrats. Confucius not only recruited a large number of elite children of civilians, but also spread aristocratic knowledge to them. Confucianism in later generations also encouraged civilians to learn etiquette, become civilized people, become qualified fathers, and imitate the nobles in establishing surnames, family trees, and family temples. The establishment and recognition of the father&#39;s symbol is an important springboard to civilization. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Small communities and private property rights&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;By clarifying the role of the father and the cultural construction of the family, it provides an accumulated foundation for the development of communities and private property. The family is the foundation of private property rights, and private property rights are an important cornerstone of civilization. Only on this foundation does it make sense to save and develop for the future. It is on the basis of private property rights that the principle of &quot;differentiated love&quot; can bring into play the interactive effect of communities of different circles. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Private property rights are not actually &quot;private&quot; as understood by Yang Zhu&#39;s atomic individuals. In a private property society, various forms of property sharing are actually practiced within families. The traditional primogeniture system in Western Europe retains the integrity of family property, although the second son can only receive an annuity provided by his elder brother, or even has no property and can only go out to explore the world. However, the family property is not &quot;privately owned&quot; by the atomic individual of the eldest son, but is the custodian between the ancestors and descendants of the blood community, so the property still belongs to the community. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In contrast, the Chinese are more inclined to divide property. In addition to other scholars, according to the law of the Song Dynasty, &quot;a woman can marry half of a man&quot;, and daughters can also get the right to inherit family property. On the one hand, Confucians encourage the formation of clan communities with more levels of property distribution without dividing families, or by establishing family common property trusts such as &quot;Fan&#39;s Yizhuang&quot; and &quot;clan fields&quot;, &quot;sacrifice fields&quot; and &quot;school fields&quot; that are common in South China. &quot; and so on, maintaining various forms of common property of small communities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The meaning of private property rights is mainly the defense mechanism that must be in place when facing public power representing the greater community. That is to say, the property rights of small communities such as families and families cannot be infringed on in the name of a large community or a society of strangers. In the face of public rights, private property rights are embodied as &quot;private&quot;, but within small communities, they are mostly represented as &quot;public&quot; with various tender feelings. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Even in the British Victorian era, which was criticized by some people, while the market economy and industrialization were highly developed, family values ​​remained strong, providing warmth and a haven to escape the cruelty of society. The song &quot;Home, Sweet Home&quot; written by John Howard Payne in 1822 has been popular in the English-speaking world for more than a hundred years. It sings: &quot;Home, home, sweet, sweet home! There is no place like home in the world. A better place”. The popularity of this song just shows that the high development of the market economy at that time did not destroy family values. On the contrary, it highlighted the &quot;privacy&quot; of the family as a small community and its positive role in protecting people. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The development of market economy&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;On the basis of private property rights, especially with the further development of the industrial and commercial economy, there is a need for rich exchanges and cooperation between strangers from all over the world. At this time, the market economy based on private property rights was nurtured and developed, and through various business models such as games and cooperation based on property rights, the lowest-cost method of cooperation between strangers in a complex society was realized. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In a free market economy, various small communities can divide labor and collaborate more effectively. With the expansion of the market order, the number of groups absorbed has further increased, and the division of labor has been continuously refined. Efficiency has increased while costs have decreased, forming a positive-sum game effect, and people can benefit together. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Under the collaboration model of the market economy, people have also learned to trade and collaborate in ways that go beyond traditional small communities. With the improvement of life and the abundance of commodities, more ordinary people have the opportunity to have access to the culture and art of past elites at low cost. Ludwig von Mises said: &quot;If an argument is needed, it is only necessary to point out how serious music has become popular in the past few decades, especially among those who are busy in business. That&#39;s enough. There has never been a time in history when art has been brought so close to the hearts of so many people&quot; ([Austrian] Ludwig von Mises: &quot;Socialism: Economic and Sociological Analysis&quot;, Translated by Wang Jianmin et al., China Social Sciences Press, 2008, p. 406). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past, classical books were extremely expensive in China, and there were many records in the literature of &quot;poor families without books&quot;. According to the &quot;Book of the Northern Qi Dynasty: Du Bi&#39;s Biography&quot;, his grandfather was the governor of Huainan and his father was the county magistrate, but his family was still &quot;poor and without books&quot;. &quot;Yan&#39;s Family Instructions Encouraging Learning&quot; specifically emphasizes, &quot;If you can always keep hundreds of volumes of books, you will never be a villain for thousands of years.&quot; As long as the family can keep some precious books, the class will not fall, but can always be Stay in the elite class. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, with the advent of the Song Dynasty, driven by the market economy, commercial book engraving began to rise and flourish, and a large number of high-end classical books began to enter the lives of ordinary people. Su Dongpo mentioned: &quot;When I met the old Confucian Mr. Yu, I said that when I was young, I wanted to get &quot;Historical Records&quot; and &quot;Han Shu&quot; but could not get them. Fortunately, I got them. I wrote them by myself and read them day and night, for fear of not being able to catch up. In recent years, people in the city have turned around. The books of hundreds of schools of thought were copied from each other, and thousands of pieces of paper were passed down every day. The books written by scholars were numerous and easy to produce&quot; (&quot;Li&#39;s Shanfang Collection Secretary&quot;). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Here, it is precisely because &quot;city people&quot; &quot;copied&quot; driven by commercial interests that caused the rapid popularity of classical books, and a large number of classical books entered the world of ordinary people. In the past in Europe, Stoic books and Rococo art were limited to a limited number of aristocratic elites and out of reach of ordinary civilians. However, with the development of market economy and industrialization, production costs have been greatly reduced, and ordinary workers can also hang a print of a Leonardo da Vinci or Van Gogh painting at home, or collect an industrially produced classical book. The market economy allows the aristocratic culture and elite rituals and music that were once aloof to enter the families and lives of ordinary people more efficiently, raising the average level of civilized society. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It can be said that from the perspective of historical genetics and natural evolutionary history, the emergence of the stable dual family, the role of &quot;father&quot; (in the cultural sense) and the marriage system, as well as the emergence of the marriage system based on this Private property rights and market economy are the two cornerstones of a civilized society. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 13 Oct 2023 22:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[以色列外交人员家属遇袭，北京警方通报]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258597]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-13 20:54:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;span>;At about 14:00 on October 13, 2023, in front of a supermarket in Zuojiazhuang, Chaoyang District , a family member of an Israeli diplomat (male, 50 years old) was stabbed by a foreigner.

Japan has also high-profilely promoted its equipment in the United States and its allies. The role of logistics support. Foreign media said that the measures taken by Western military industrial groups are almost synchronized with the introduction of Japan&#39;s defense budget for the next five years, and they intend to prepare in advance within the framework of a quasi-alliance and cut the budget &quot;cake&quot; to the maximum extent. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, British Aerospace Systems has established close ties with Japan and plans to move its Asia-Pacific headquarters from Malaysia to Japan within the year to prepare to supply Patriot PAC-3 missile defense systems to Japan. France&#39;s Thales will cooperate with Japan&#39;s Mitsubishi Heavy Industries to develop and produce equipment such as mine detectors. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Under the combined influence of commercial and political factors, Japan suddenly became a &quot;hot potato&quot; sought after by arms dealers in the United States, Britain and France. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In recent times, the United States has frequently held offensive and defensive exercises with Japan, South Korea, and Australia, which has made the situation on the Korean Peninsula, Taiwan Strait, and South China Sea tense in Northeast Asia. Western arms dealers have a keen sense of smell. On the one hand, they are concerned about changes in the geopolitical situation, and on the other hand, they also fancy the business opportunities brought by Japan&#39;s substantial increase in defense spending. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some analysts believe that as tensions in Northeast Asia escalate and Japan increases its defense spending, the changes made by these arms giants in order to cooperate with Japan&#39;s major adjustments to its defense strategy indicate that Japan hopes to further achieve cooperation with the United States and Europe. &quot;Military binding&quot; supports its ambition to expand its military power. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;Opportunity to take advantage of&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Western arms dealers have moved their Asia-Pacific headquarters to Japan, selling arms nearby, and launching &quot;face-to-face&quot; in-depth cooperation with Japan , a win-win situation can be achieved. From a deeper analysis, this is the reason why the United States uses Japan and Japan hopes to &quot;borrow ships to go to sea.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Currently, the Biden administration has established many &quot;small circles&quot; in the hope of using, controlling and arming allies. Through the research and development of various advanced weapons and equipment, frequent military exercises with deterrence and actual combat significance, fighting &quot;proxy wars&quot;, testing the effectiveness of weapons and equipment and strategies and tactics, making huge fortunes by promoting arms, creating conflicts and conflicts, undermining regional stability, and maintaining it. In the global hegemonic position, it achieves the goal of &quot;killing many birds with one stone&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Compared with Japan, South Korea, Australia, and the Philippines do not have advantages in military and technology. The United States&#39; selection and use of Japan is also &quot;a no-brainer.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As early as the Korean War and the Vietnam War, Western arms dealers had a history of moving their Asian defense contractor headquarters to Japan, allowing Japan to reap the benefits of its rapid economic rise. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the outbreak of the Vietnam War, Japan&#39;s heavy industry restarted. As Japan is the rear area for US military war supplies, a large number of orders for military supplies continue to fall on Japan&#39;s military production lines. Mitsubishi Heavy Industries is a long-established military industrial enterprise of Japanese manufacturers. It has a complete production line of F-4 fighter jets. The F-4 Phantom fighter jets it produces have played a huge role as the main fighter aircraft of the U.S. Navy and Air Force, helping the U.S. military win 277 wars. The victory helped the US military save some face in the Vietnam battlefield. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Now, the United States still wants to use Japan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the end of the Cold War, European arms dealers basically did not develop much. Therefore, European countries are also optimistic about Japan&#39;s funds and technology. At the same time, Japan also hopes to develop weapons and equipment instead of just relying on the United States. Before this, it was difficult for the United States to allow Japan to extend its olive branch to other countries in the research and development of weapons and equipment, especially heavy weapons and equipment. Now, the United States is opening up and hopes to arm Japan and allow Japan to provide assistance to the United States in the Western Pacific. assume more defensive obligations. Therefore, after the United States gave the green light, Japan and European countries moved forward in cooperation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the other hand, Japan’s security strategy has shifted from self-defense to auxiliary offense. At the end of 2022, Japan adjusted its security strategy. From the so-called self-defense in the past to the current auxiliary offense, it is expanding its military preparations in all aspects. Whether it is technology, funding, or procurement, Japan&#39;s own military production capacity alone is obviously not enough. . Therefore, Japan&#39;s turning its attention to European countries also reflects changes in its security strategy. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;“There is money to be made”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;On August 27, 2023, “Nikkei Asia” reported that “the world’s largest defense contractors Businesses are transferring their business operations in Asia to Japan, because in the face of the deteriorating security situation in East Asia, Japan is preparing to significantly increase defense expenses.&quot; Japan&#39;s &quot;business&quot; with Western arms dealers is conducive to dividing the cake and achieving strong alliances. , each takes what he needs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From fiscal year 2023 to 2027, Japan’s total defense budget will reach 43 trillion yen, 1.6 times that of the previous five years. The latest defense budget finalized by the Japanese Ministry of Defense for 2024 has reached 7.7 trillion yen, equivalent to more than 380 billion yuan, once again setting a record high. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among them, 900 billion yen will be used to purchase various ammunition and weapons and equipment, including new ship-to-air missiles and long-range cruise missiles. For example: the mass production costs of the &quot;performance-enhanced version&quot; of the Ground Self-Defense Force&#39;s Type 12 land-based anti-ship missile with a range extending to about 1,000 kilometers, and the production costs of &quot;high-speed gliding missiles&quot; used to defend islands such as the Southwest Islands. In addition, there are 64 billion yen for a new generation fighter aircraft project jointly carried out by Britain, Japan and Italy, and 75 billion yen for a new anti-missile interceptor jointly developed by the United States and Japan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In March 2023, Japan held the largest international defense exhibition, attracting more than 250 arms companies from more than 60 countries and regions. European and American companies participating in the exhibition have shown great interest in the Japanese market. The Japanese government has planned to allocate more than 200 billion yen to purchase approximately 400 Tomahawk cruise missiles. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Japan plans to deploy two Aegis system carrier ships by 2028, establish a new permanent &quot;unified headquarters&quot; in Tokyo Ichigaya, and uniformly command the three self-defense forces of land, sea and air; purchase long-range missiles and improve the Aegis system Carrier ships; develop new fields such as drones, space and the Internet, and ammunition support to improve sustained combat capabilities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Kishida government&#39;s sharp increase in defense expenses has allowed European and American arms dealers to smell business opportunities. Behind the increase in Japan&#39;s military expenditures, it reflects that Japan and the United States have cooperated more frequently at the strategic and tactical levels in recent years. This is reflected in the fact that the US-Japan alliance is undergoing subtle and profound changes. The alliance system has gradually changed from the past &quot;American master and Japanese slave&quot;. Shifting to &quot;US-Japan coordination&quot; means that the United States needs Japan to step up to the forefront in a series of regional disputes, including regional hotspot issues. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The relocation of Western arms dealers to Japan may further fuel Japan&#39;s maritime ambitions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Japan has proposed that it should shift from the past &quot;marine defense governance&quot; to &quot;marine defense governance&quot;. Japan&#39;s ambition to become a maritime power is fully reflected in each phase of the basic marine plan. In addition, Japan plans to launch a series of maritime security assistance and increase strategic attention to Indo-Pacific countries, which will also bring certain complexity to the regional situation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Japan’s ambition has always been demonstrated. Today, Japan plans to build the so-called largest warship after World War II - a modern version of the &quot;Yamato&quot; ship, which is 1.7 times the size of the U.S. Burke destroyer and exceeds the average tonnage of U.S. combat ships in terms of displacement and comprehensive combat power. This also shows that Japan can achieve great progress and development in its ocean strategy and offensive strategy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From the perspective of weapons and equipment configuration, the United States’ Standard 6 (SM-6) air defense missiles will be used on this ship, and Japan’s air defense and anti-missile capabilities will be further improved. If the &quot;Yamato&quot; ship is equipped with a ground-attack version of the Type 12 anti-ship missile, its range can reach 1,000 kilometers. Japan&#39;s future maritime platforms will have powerful ground attack capabilities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Japan’s military spending is rising and it wants to expand its military preparations. Western arms dealers see business opportunities and flock to them. Fundamentally speaking, this will allow the United States to better utilize and control Japan with the help of arms dealers and maintain the United States in the &quot;Indo-Pacific&quot; regional” and even global hegemony. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Japan&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Arms Upgrading&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Japan has introduced the core business of the Western military industry and is also trying to intentionally introduce Western technology into its own arms production chain. middle. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On June 28, the Japan Defense Equipment Agency issued the &quot;Defense Technology Guidelines 2023&quot;, reaffirming the strategy of &quot;building a nation through scientific and technological innovation&quot;, focusing on strengthening defense capabilities and developing weapons and equipment that are ahead of other countries. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the plan, within 5 to 10 years, Japan will produce weapons directly related to future combat methods, and after 10 years, it will realize the equipment of important technologies. Japan has listed 12 key technologies such as unmanned technology, new energy, new materials, instant communications and data processing as pillar technologies for the future defense industry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Japanese military-industrial complex giant said that the entry of Western arms companies will increase the number of orders from small and medium-sized parts suppliers. There are currently 1,100 companies engaged in the production of fighter jet parts, 1,300 companies engaged in the production of tank parts, and 830 companies engaged in the production of warship parts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Japan has reached an agreement with the United Kingdom and Italy to jointly develop sixth-generation fighter aircraft, and recently jointly developed high-performance missiles with the United States for intercepting hypersonic weapons. Companies established in the UK, France, Italy and other countries plan to increase the number of employees and will mainly recruit local Japanese personnel. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The American L3 Harris Technology Company is an aerospace company in the United States. It has begun negotiations with the Japanese Ministry of Defense on cooperation in drones and other fields, which provides a favorable opportunity for Japan to improve its military production capacity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;With the support of European and American arms dealers, Japan follows or coordinates with the United States and the West. During this sensitive period, Japan&#39;s defense budget is also increasing year by year. If this continues, Japan will fall into an endless cycle of arms race, which will bring serious danger to the regional situation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another situation is that in order to make money, Western arms dealers may use the power of capital to bribe Japanese media, add fuel to the flames, and deliberately create conflicts. Western arms dealers have moved their Asian headquarters to Japan to cooperate with Japan in military research and development and sales. The Japanese government claims that the purchase of weapons and ammunition is a &quot;defensive measure.&quot; If the United States, the West and Japan intervene in hot geopolitical issues through arms exports, it will provoke conflicts and confrontations among relevant countries and make the situation in the Asia-Pacific region even more tense. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Currently, six European and American arms dealers have moved to Japan and signed an agreement to &quot;carry out large-scale arms modifications in Japan&quot;. They are suspected of shifting arms to prepare for war, making it easier for Japan to obtain offensive weapons. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Japan plans to rely on its military cooperation with the United States to gradually realize its so-called military ambitions in the context of great power competition and the Indo-Pacific strategy. Once the devil of militarism is released from its cage, it will have , the impact on the world will further increase. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Now, the United States openly and covertly supports Japan to increase its defense budget. Japan&#39;s past &quot;exclusive defense&quot; has turned to &quot;active defense&quot; and it emphasizes the ability to attack enemy bases. The United States has adopted an attitude of encouragement and even support. Under this general premise, it is possible that the regional arms race will become more and more unfavorable, which is also caused by the United States and Japan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 13 Oct 2023 20:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[一观众从三楼看展坠亡，广东美术馆通报]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258581]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-13 19:50:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span>;&lt;strong>;Situation Briefing&lt;/strong>;&lt; /span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the morning of October 8, Ms. Yang, a visitor, visited the Guangdong Museum of Art and accidentally fell from Exhibition Hall 12 on the third floor of our museum to Exhibition Hall 6 on the second floor at around 11:50. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the incident, our library immediately activated the emergency plan and quickly dialed 120 emergency hotline and 110 police hotline.

&lt;p>;通过对20家上市银行近3年中报、年报数据纵向和横向比较，并结合其2023年中期业绩发布会及交流会透露的相关信息，南方周末新金融研究中心研究员研究发现，近年来，20家商业银行正在紧锣密鼓地调整其经营策略。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在信贷投向上，20家商业银行正逐渐从原来以租赁和房地产领域为主逐渐转向以制造业为主的实体经济领域。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;投资业务则成为股份制银行和城商行投资业务近年来的发力重点，并取得了一定成效。 “商投行”一体化的发展战略正稳步进行，投贷联动效益逐步体现。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;各商业银行战略级的“数字化转型”开始从“量的增长”转向“质的提升”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;贷款倾向制造业和科技业&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;南方周末新金融研究中心研究员通过梳理20家商业银行2023年中期业绩发布会、2023年中报和2022年年报发现，20家商业银行均在2022年年报中提到了让利实体经济，并为制造业和国家重点领域提供资金支持的战略。此战略在各行2023年中报中再被强调：各行均提出未来持续提升服务实体经济质效的目标。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;从20家商业银行在2022年中报和2023年中报披露的公司类贷款行业分布情况上分析，各银行在2022年年报里提及的上述战略已取得一定成效。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;制造业和科技服务业国家重点战略领域行业的公司贷款余额同比增长率分别为25.02%、64.35%。从公司贷款余额的绝对数值上来看，2023年上半年，20家商业银行制造业公司贷款余额达15.86万亿元，成为公司贷款余额最高的行业，超越租赁和商务服务业15.35万亿元的公司贷款余额。而2022年上半年公司类贷款余额最高的行业是租赁和商务服务业。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;由此可见，一年间，商业银行信贷结构由原来的租赁、房地产和制造业“三足鼎立”的态势转变为以制造业为主的模式。这也与中国当下“房地产、基建、金融”的旧三角循环向“科技、产业、金融”的新三角循环的经济形式相呼应。与此同时，这也反映出当前银行资金流向实体经济，并助力制造业和科学研究和技术服务业发展的新现象。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/13/N9oJ5kvONawBpMQ3lLRpiKdDJJ8PVPk9WsUhQisL.jpg&quot;

&lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（冯庆超/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;信贷投放向制造业倾斜的主力军是“工、农、中、建、交”五大国有行。 2023年上半年，五大国有行制造业公司贷款余额总计为10.84万亿元，占20家银行制造业公司贷款余额总和的68.36%。兴业银行、招商银行和浦发银行三家股份制银行则分别以6694.12亿元、5499.76亿元和5426.72亿元的制造业公司贷款余额紧随在五大国有行后，高于邮储银行4957.32亿元的制造业公司贷款余额。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;南方周末新金融研究中心研究员还发现，科学研究和技术服务业公司贷款逐渐成为股份制银行和城商行关注的领域，或与国有行错位竞争的策略有关。其中，国有行和部分股份制银行没有披露此项余额，城商行之中的上海银行在2022年中报中并未披露该项余额，但从2022年年报开始到2023年中报，该行皆披露了此项贷款余额。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;从绝对数值上看，2023年上半年，兴业银行和浦发银行此项余额最高，分别为365.36亿元和329.44亿元。从同比增长率上看，南京银行和北京银行的同比增长率最高，分别为92.67%和83.11%。由此可见，股份制银行是该行业贷款主力，而城商行对该领域的重视程度则逐渐增加。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;投资业务&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;成为&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;重要增长点&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;在贷款业务转向之际，20家银行发力投行业务、金融市场业务和“商投行”一体化战略。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;南方周末新金融研究中心研究员对20家银行2023年中报及其中期业绩发布会和投资者交流会信息进行梳理后发现，大部分银行提及加强投行业务、金融市场板块和构建“商投行”一体化的发展战略。从银行近年来营收结构和资产结构分析，该战略业已取得一定成效。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;对于金融投资业务而言，投资收益、公允价值变动净收益和汇兑净收益三项指标尤为重要，且三个指标之间关联性较强。为了探究各行强化金融投资业务策略的实际效益，南方周末新金融研究中心研究员对近三年来20家银行的上述三项指标总和占营收比重进行了统计。统计发现，无论是国有行还是股份制银行抑或城商行，该比值均呈上升态势，且城商行的上升趋势最为明显。在传统信贷业务无法占据优势的情况下，城商行正以投资业务为突破口进行扩表。以2023年9月22日首次入围中国系统性重要银行名单的南京银行为例，2023年上半年，该行三项收益指标总额占营收比重就达32.15%。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/13/Ofc6345KnFX3DOnrAT9TLvvgUBlY7MNjsr8GXJAv.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;866&quot; height=&quot;796&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/13/Ofc6345KnFX3DOnrAT9TLvvgUBlY7MNjsr8GXJAv.jpg&quot;

&lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（冯庆超/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;实际上，上述三项收益指标与交易性金融资产高度相关。近年来股份制银行和城商行的交易性金融资产占总资产的比例也同样呈现增长态势。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/13/RKL1YucI0TOTVGgvItL317nTxA6jNIjeJJ9bYVcj.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;866&quot; height=&quot;796&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/13/RKL1YucI0TOTVGgvItL317nTxA6jNIjeJJ9bYVcj.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254031&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（冯庆超/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;根据南京银行2023年中报、2022年中报、2022年年报、2021年年报以及2020年年报的数据，在2023年6月末、2022年12月末以及2021年12月末，其交易性金融资产的同比增长率分别为40.32%、39.28%和77.41%。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;为了深度剖析各行投资业务的构成，南方周末新金融研究中心研究员梳理了20家银行中三项收益占比营收最高的五家银行在2023年中报披露的交易性金融资产数据。经统计，这些银行交易性金融资产数值最大的科目皆为基金，其次是债券或资管信托计划。而商业银行投资的基金一般是以债券基金和货币型基金为主。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;通过研究银行投资的债券基金种类，南方周末新金融研究中心研究员发现，部分银行的债券投资策略是购买该行旗下基金管理子公司发行的定开债基。而这种策略或可达到降低债券投资成本的效果。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;以兴业银行为例，根据兴业基金发行的基金产品披露的2023年中期报告，该行持有旗下兴业基金管理有限公司发行的兴业嘉荣一年定期开放债券型发起式证券投资基金和兴业嘉福一年定期开放债券型发起式证券投资基金的份额分别为99.87%和99.88%。而根据《财政部国家税务总局关于企业所得税若干优惠政策的通知》的第二条，证券投资基金从证券市场中取得的收入，包括买卖股票、债券的差价收入，股权的股息、红利收入，债券的利息收入及其他收入，暂不征收企业所得税。即与直接投资金融债券相比，银行若通过定开债基间接投资金融债券则可以免交25%的所得税，从而降低投资成本。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;而对于直接投资债券的债权投资科目而言，12家商业银行（20家商业银行当中只有12家商业银行2023年中报披露了此数据）中有10家保持了同比增长。其中，同比减少的两家银行为南京银行和平安银行。这两家银行的债权投资金额虽然同比降低了11.49%和1.96%，但是其交易性金融资产却同比增长了40.32%和17.81%，而其交易性金融资产当中基金和债券的比例均较高，债基或交易性金融资产里的债券金额总额的增长足以覆盖债券投资科目的同比减少金额。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;总体而言，无论是直接投资债券还是间接投资债券基金，各行的金融投资业务标的均是以债券为主。而从整体规模和收益水平上看，股份制银行和城商行确实仍处在加强投资业务的既定战略当中，且该战略也取得了一定成效。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;股份制银行和城商行的投行业务近两年同样有所提升。以兴业银行和南京银行为例，根据wind数据库2022年债券承销排行榜，兴业银行总承销金额9477.46亿元排名第6，前5名为工商银行、中国银行、建设银行、农业银行和交通银行五大国有行。而南京银行则以2845.05亿元排名第14。截至2023年9月27日，wind数据库2023年债券承销排行榜显示，兴业银行以7983.74亿元的总承销金额排名第5，超越了交通银行。南京银行则以2736.2亿元的总承销金额提升了一名，成为第13名。因此，从上述两家银行的金额和排名变化来看，股份行和城商行的债券承销实力确有所提升。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;剖析银行的债券承销业务发现，银行的投行业务战略和信贷业务的战略相近，整体呈现出资金流向科创和绿色等国家重点领域，实现投贷联动的效果。以兴业银行为例，根据该行2023年中报，其承销绿色非金融企业债务融资工具规模达137.20 亿元，列股份制银行第一位，且落地了首单科创类REITs业务。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;从收益角度上，投资业务是各行较为重要的增长点，各行或可通过持续加大该项业务的占比的策略来实现稳定扩表的目的。但南方周末新金融研究中心研究员发现，上述三项收益指标皆与交易性金融资产有关，而交易性金融资产的增加将直接导致风险加权资产的提升，从而降低核心一级资本充足率。因此，通过投资业务提升收入的空间有限。而&lt;span>;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.infzm.com/contents/257314?source=147&amp;amp;source_1=238&quot;>;&lt;u>;《20家银行净利占A股1/3强，“利润王”对抗息差压力分化加剧》&lt;/u>;&lt;/a>;&lt;/span>;中也提到“股份行中的中信、华夏和浙商银行，其核心一级资本充足率逼近监管红线”。因此，南方周末新金融研究中心研究员建议，各行在大力发展投贷联动策略的同时也需注重一级资本充足率，切勿盲目扩表导致触碰监管红线。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;摒弃量的增长&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;，&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;数字化转型&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;向质转变&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;在投贷联动效应显现的同时，各行对金融科技的态度有所转变。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;南方周末新金融研究中心研究员对20家银行2023年中报、中期业绩发布会和各行金融科技岗位招聘信息的梳理后发现，在数字化转型策略上，相比于往年资金和人力投入量的增长，2023年各行或更注重讲究质的呈现。据中国金融新闻网报道，从2023年秋招情况来看，工商银行、中国银行和农业银行的金融科技岗位首次出现了“缩招”现象。而根据四大国有行2022年年报数据，“工、农、中、建”四家银行科技从业人员均过万人，金融科技岗位员工数量已趋近“饱和”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;部分银行对金融科技领域的资金投入力度也不如往年。 20家银行当中，仅招商银行和光大银行在2023年中报中披露了信息科技投入的数据，分别为52.06亿元和20.43亿元，同比减少2.87%和4.44%。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但在提质方面，各行在数字转型成效上提供了许多具体案例。如，工商银行基于量子模拟器完成了量子技术在债券投资组合和期权定价等场景应用的可行性评估；招商银行借助模型自动审贷，“招企贷”实现企业贷款全流程线上化，客户从申请至放款最快0.5个工作日；宁波银行则发挥微信银行在触达客户、产品推广等方面的优势，丰富了语音、视频等服务方式，为客户提供更高效的金融服务体验和更加简单的业务办理流程。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;通过纵向定量比对也可发现，相比于2022年，各行在金融科技领域和数字化转型方面有更多实际成效。如，截至2023年6月末，工商银行深化企业级对公数字化运营管理平台建设，平台触达客户超160万户；招商银行“AI小招”服务用户1,172.88万户，同比增长140.84%；北京银行“智策”零售数字化运营体系累计上线策略1,200 余条，触达客户超1.7 亿人次。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;而通过定量横向比较可知，工商银行数字化转型和科技能力是20家银行当中的佼佼者。在金融科技方面，截至2023年6月末，工商银行新增公开专利1878 件，累计专利授权数量2941件，均排名同业第一。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;各行科技赋能风控领域的效果也比以往更显著。以工商银行2023年中报披露的数字化赋能普惠金融风控体系为例，该报告详细描述了数字化准入、智能化风控、线上线下交叉验证的全过程，而其不良率的同比下降也同样证明了数字化转型的效益。其中，&lt;span>;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.infzm.com/contents/257314?source=147&amp;amp;source_1=238&quot;>;&lt;u>;《20家银行净利占A股1/3强，“利润王”对抗息差压力分化加剧》&lt;/u>;&lt;/a>;&lt;/span>;中已称，“2023年上半年，20家银行不良贷款率几乎全部下降，仅有平安银行不良贷款率上升1BP。”不良率同比降低了30BP的北京银行更是在其中报的数字化转型板块中强调了统一风控平台的投产建设。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;由上述分析可知，科技赋能风控、手机银行业务和科技提升投资策略已取得一定成效。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但数字化转型之路还很漫长。南方周末新金融研究中心研究员最近通过实测不同银行柜台业务和调研不同行业从业人员发现，大部分银行柜台业务办理时间仍然较长。虽然每个银行门口都摆放机器人和智能化柜台，但从客户体验而言，机器人更多像一个摆设，智能化柜台可办理的业务也相当有限。人工柜台业务流程相当复杂，等待银行工作人员操作的时间也较长。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;南方周末新金融研究中心研究员认为，相比于以前，当前信息科技在线上业务的应用已较为广泛，且有实际数据支持。若银行能加大科技在柜台办理业务领域的应用，如将更多柜台业务搬至线上办理，或可较大程度地降低人工成本，同时提升效率。事实上，已有银行开始尝试迈出这一步。邮储银行在2023年中报中披露，正在探索数字运营，并创新推出“云柜”集约化运营模式。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 13 Oct 2023 19:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[男子相亲后被诬强奸，五年方还清白：强加于己的巨大冤屈如何洗刷？丨快评]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258513]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-13 18:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Recently, a retrial verdict has brought an old news back into public opinion. According to &quot;Dafeng News&quot;, Di, a native of Luannan, Hebei, who had been sentenced to three years in prison for rape, finally waited for a fair judgment from the court on October 10, 2023: The Tangshan Intermediate People&#39;s Court ruled that &quot;the facts are unclear and the evidence is insufficient.&quot; &quot;The original verdict was revoked and Xiao Di was found not guilty. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The timeline of this case is not complicated. On February 22, 2018, a dating agency in Luannan County introduced a woman to Di. After the two met, &quot;both were quite satisfied.&quot; That night, Di invited the woman and Wang, the owner of the dating agency, to dinner. After dinner, Di drove the woman in question and invited her out to play. They had a &quot;very good chat&quot; and had sex in the car. Afterwards, Di drove the woman back to the dating agency. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The owner of the dating agency called Di that night and said, &quot;The woman no longer wanted to have sex after having sex&quot; and &quot;asked Di to compensate the woman with tens of thousands of yuan.&quot; In desperation, Di had no choice but to return to the dating agency and work with the boss to find the woman involved to coordinate, but they did not reach an agreement on the &quot;compensation&quot;. On the second day after the incident, Wang took two people to Di&#39;s home and formally made a &quot;compensation request&quot; of 20,000 yuan. Di thought Wang was extorting money and was unwilling to accept it. Wang called the police that day. In the next few days, Di gave Wang several thousand yuan and received the assurance from the other party that &quot;it will be fine.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On March 1, a week after the incident, Di was detained on suspicion of rape and arrested 12 days later. On June 1, 2018, the Luannan County Procuratorate prosecuted Di for rape. On December 29 of the same year, Di was sentenced to three years in prison for rape, and his second-instance appeal was also rejected. During his sentence, Di insisted on not pleading guilty and asked to appeal. He waited until February 28, 2021, to be released after serving his sentence. After being released from prison, Di requested a retrial. After more than two years of judicial proceedings, he finally won a not guilty verdict recently. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This case has been delayed for five years. After many twists and turns, there are still many unanswered questions about the case. A retrial should not be the end of this case. Although the parties involved have been avenged, there are still many aspects of this case that deserve further questioning and analysis. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First, the owner of the dating agency and the woman involved are suspected of extortion and should be held legally accountable. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If you examine the case carefully, it is not difficult to see the absurdity of the &quot;rape&quot; accusation. I would like to ask, if &quot;rape&quot; really exists, can &quot;paying 20,000 yuan&quot; be exchanged for not calling the police? How is this different from prostitution? The woman involved “no longer wanted to have sex after having sex.” Could it be that the so-called “consent” could be revoked at any time afterwards? If this is the case, the evidentiary standards for rape cases handled by public prosecutors and prosecutors are too low. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since the client is not found guilty of rape, the behavior of the dating agency owner is an out-and-out extortion, and there are both completed and attempted circumstances. According to Article 1 of the &quot;Interpretation on Several Issues Concerning the Application of Laws in Handling Criminal Cases of Extortion&quot; promulgated by the two high authorities on April 23, 2013, extortion of public and private property worth more than 2,000 yuan to 5,000 yuan should be deemed as Article 274 of the Criminal Law The specified &quot;amount is relatively large&quot;. According to the standards of Hebei Province&#39;s two highs, the starting point for &quot;larger amounts&quot; is 3,000 yuan. In this case, the successful extortion amount by the owner of the dating agency was &quot;several thousand yuan&quot;, and the attempted extortion amount was 20,000 yuan, which fully meets the standard of &quot;large amount&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Secondly, the owner of the dating agency and the woman involved in this case are also suspected of false accusation and frame-up. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Compared with the public opinion offensive of &quot;Internet essays&quot; in recent years, the false accusation method in this case can be described as simple and crude, and the case was reported directly to the public security organ. Judging from the results, the false accusation and frame-up caused the client Di to be imprisoned for three years, and it took a lot of time and energy to get justice. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The experience of the parties involved in this case is undoubtedly worse than that of those &quot;victims of Internet essays&quot;. Since the false accusation has caused serious consequences for him being wrongly imprisoned, Di has more reason to obtain corresponding judicial relief. Article 243 of the Criminal Law stipulates that fabricating facts to frame others with the intention of subjecting others to criminal prosecution, if the circumstances are serious, shall constitute the crime of false accusation and frame-up. If the circumstances are serious, he shall be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of not more than three years, criminal detention or surveillance; if serious consequences are caused, he shall be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of not less than three years and not more than ten years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The client’s acquittal is only the starting point for him to seek judicial relief, and should not be the end. Di has the right to file a criminal private prosecution with the court, requesting the public authorities to hold the owner of the dating agency and Wang accountable for criminal liability, and assume the accompanying civil compensation obligations, to relieve the heavy losses he has suffered in the past five years, and to clear up the huge injustice that has been imposed on him. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Thirdly, the dating agency and the woman involved may have serious suspicions of &quot;fairy dancing&quot; and organizing fraud. This is also something that the police should investigate in depth. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this case, the dating agency and the woman involved showed a situation of &quot;cooperating with each other and playing tricks skillfully&quot;. The woman&#39;s words and deeds were inconsistent, and the owner of the dating agency acted as a &quot;middleman&quot; to negotiate &quot;compensation&quot; with the client. Combined with the &quot;reverent&quot; attitude of the dating agency owner, this case has been cast into layers of suspicion of fraud. The suspicion that the dating agency owner and the woman involved colluded to commit the crime cannot be ruled out. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If the suspicion of collusion is established, then this case can be called a &quot;dating agency fraud&quot;. The method is more sinister and vicious than the previous marriage agencies that &quot;only seek to make money&quot;. &quot;Property&quot; marriage fraud is more crude and direct. It can be regarded as a &quot;fairy jump fraud&quot; disguised as a matchmaking agency, and is suspected of constituting the crime of fraud. Article 266 of the Criminal Law stipulates that whoever defrauds public or private property and the amount is relatively large shall be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of not more than three years, criminal detention or public surveillance, and shall also or solely be fined. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From the perspective of public interest, the owner of the dating agency and the woman involved in this case also deserve to be severely punished by the law. If the result of this case is that one person, Di, is not guilty and the two are not punished, it will be tantamount to institutional incentives for similar acts of extortion, false accusations and frame-ups, leading to a situation where &quot;one will not be held responsible no matter what if the blackmail and false accusations fail.&quot; This situation is obviously not conducive to curbing similar illegal and criminal activities and puts more potential victims at risk. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In short, Di, the party involved in this case, certainly has reason to seek state compensation and compensation for the various losses caused by being wrongfully imprisoned. At the same time, he will launch a criminal private prosecution against the owner of the dating agency and the woman involved to pursue their various criminal responsibilities. They are required to fulfill their accompanying civil compensation obligations and seek justice for themselves. It is also necessary for relevant departments to intervene and conduct an in-depth investigation into the suspicion that the owner of the dating agency and the woman involved have committed gang fraud, so as to deter similar people who are lucky enough to get involved. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 13 Oct 2023 18:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[猫狗鸟蛇……每年五十多万只动物命丧公路]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258541]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-13 17:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/13/rdNvCtUMWcYoDaCM7cWfhM9jc5aX1oAK7AVNT30h.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1268&quot; height=&quot;870&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/13/rdNvCtUMWcYoDaCM7cWfhM9jc5aX1 oAK7AVNT30h. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254037&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Roadkilled cat. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of the research team)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The blackbird (dōng), which is black all over and has a yellow beak, is a common bird in the city. It is good at imitating the calls of other birds and likes to move in the woods. Street trees and shrubs on both sides of the road provide ideal habitats for blackbirds, but they also pose fatal risks. Li Zhongqiu, a professor at the School of Life Sciences of Nanjing University, encountered blackbirds that suddenly appeared several times while driving, and almost became a &quot;murderer&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Animal-vehicle collisions that result in fatal accidents are known as &quot;road kills.&quot; Nowadays, wheels have replaced shotguns as one of the main threats to animals, whether in inaccessible reserves or traffic-filled cities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The number of animals killed on the roads is unimaginable. A research paper with Li Zhongqiu as the corresponding author was recently published in the academic journal PeerJ: More than 570,000 birds and mammals may be roadkilled in Nanjing every year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There have been few systematic studies on road killing in China before. The study by Li Zhongqiu’s team evaluated the background data of road killing in Nanjing, a large city. &quot;Road killing is a very serious threat, but there is insufficient awareness among both the academic community and the public.&quot; Li Zhongqiu said. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Cats, dogs, blackbirds, and sparrows are at the highest risk&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;my country’s total road mileage has reached 5.28 million kilometers, which can circle the earth more than 100 times. The transportation network extending in all directions has provided convenience for human life, but it has become a natural barrier for many wild animals. Every time you cross the road, it is like experiencing a journey of life and death. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Academic research shows that 340 million birds die on the road in the United States every year, about 335,000 hedgehogs die on the road in the United Kingdom every year, and about 9 million large and medium-sized mammals die in traffic accidents in Brazil every year. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Zhongqiu told Southern Weekend reporters that road killing is one of the research contents of the interdisciplinary &quot;road ecology&quot; and there are many academic studies in the United States, Europe and other countries. However, currently, road killing is systematically carried out in China. There are not many studies, and the existing studies are mostly conducted in protected areas and lack analysis of urban environments. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since 2020, Li Zhongqiu’s team has carried out a one-year monitoring of 9 roads in Nanjing. These 9 roads include 3 national roads, 3 provincial roads and 3 county roads. The roadside habitats cover residential areas, farmland, mountains, waters, open lands, forests, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/13/jHJGDj2QDMJyU4a0y9f3ok1ynq3BEws2c2vzFxAb.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;563&quot; height= &quot;694&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/13/jHJGDj2QDMJyU4a0y9f3ok1ynq3BEws2c2vzFxAb.png&quot; data-key=&quot;254036&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;A research team observes roadkill in Nanjing. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(paper screenshot/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Every two weeks, the researchers walked the entire route at a speed of no more than 40km/h. Record dead animals found on the road. The total mileage traveled is 5,831 kilometers, which is equivalent to the round-trip distance from Beijing to Urumqi. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 26 monitoring activities, researchers found a total of 293 roadkill animals. There are 136 mammals among them, the most common ones are cats and dogs, as well as wild mammals such as weasels and hedgehogs, and a kind of reptile - the tiger-spotted snake. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are 143 birds, the most common ones being blackbirds and sparrows, which is related to their large population and wide distribution. Other birds include pearl-necked doves, gray magpies, white-headed bulbuls, etc., most of which are common species. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;May to July is the peak period for road killings. The number of road killings in these three months accounts for about 1/3 of the whole year. Li Zhongqiu explained that this period is the breeding season for many animals. The baby animals lack survival experience. Adult animals increase the frequency of foraging to raise their children, and the probability of road kill increases. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The locations where road kills occur are closely related to the animals’ habitats. For example, road sections with a high proportion of farmland, forestry and wetland areas have a higher risk of roadkill; the smaller the distance between the road and the river, the higher the risk of roadkill; roadkill is more likely to occur in areas far away from urban main roads ; Compared to curvy roads, the risk of roadkill is higher on straight roads because vehicles travel faster. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Through the model, researchers calculated the number of animals that are killed on the road in Nanjing every year - more than 110,000 mammals and more than 450,000 birds. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The model is constructed based on on-site monitoring of the retention time of animal carcasses, the probability of discovery, and the composition of different roads in Nanjing. Since the carcasses of roadkill animals do not remain on the road for too long, the researchers placed frozen chicken heads and frozen whole chickens on multiple road sections to represent small and large animal carcasses respectively, monitored the retention time of the simulated carcasses on the road, and calculated the number of roadkill animals. The probability of detection. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/13/ctOxUfPfW7fH3pxoUlBEeQxIpnJsRrjlm6UaHUNb.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;303&quot; height= &quot;203&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/13/ctOxUfPfW7fH3pxoUlBEeQxIpnJsRrjlm6UaHUNb.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254035&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Roadkilled bird. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of the research team)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Common species also have important value&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;How to help animals reduce traffic accidents risks of? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many protected areas establish ecological corridors for animal migration along transportation routes. For example, the Qinghai-Tibet Railway has established 33 wildlife crossings for sheep migration, benefiting Tibetan antelopes and other wild animals; Hubei Shennongjia National Park has built a total of 25 animal crossings of three types: upper span type, lower culvert type and gentle slope type. , making it easier for Sichuan snub-nosed monkeys to cross; Yunnan Province&#39;s Si Xiao Expressway has set up bridges and tunnels for Asian elephants, and the utilization rate of 25 wildlife passages by wild Asian elephants reached 72%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ecological corridors can also be established on busy urban highways. For example, in 2020, the Paiya Mountain-Qiniang Mountain Ecological Corridor in Dapeng New District, Shenzhen was completed, connecting the two mountains and spanning the highway. It is the first animal-only overpass in Guangdong Province that was completed and put into use. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Staff from the Dapeng Administration Bureau of the Shenzhen Municipal Planning and Natural Resources Bureau told Southern Weekend reporters that in 2018, Dapeng New District conducted a survey on road deaths of wild animals. In July and August, A total of 383 road kill incidents were recorded, killing more than 40 species, mainly amphibians and reptiles such as black-orbited toads, Hong Kong newts, anoles, etc., with a small number of birds and mammals also recorded. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The staff member said that ecological corridors not only reconnect fragmented habitats, but also effectively reduce the occurrence of road kills. More than 40 infrared cameras arranged on the ecological corridor bridge have recorded that more than 60 species of animals breed, forage, and move within the ecological corridor. Wild mammals such as ocelots, wild boars, porcupines, and macaques have been recorded. A good animal habitat is formed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Zhongqiu believes that whether cities build ecological corridors should focus on cost and local species. There are also some effective methods, such as setting up signboards in roadkill hotspots to remind drivers that animals are often found here, slowing down and observing more road conditions, or setting up speed bumps, building animal fences, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Zhongqiu admitted that the current understanding and research on road killing is still relatively rudimentary, and “it is difficult to assess the impact of road killing on the local ecosystem.” But at least from the data, road killing is The problem deserves more attention. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At present, Li Zhongqiu’s team’s research on road killing is only carried out in Nanjing. He hopes that in the future, the regional scope can be expanded to a national scale to conduct more in-depth research. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although the animals that encounter roadkill in cities are common species, they still have a unique status in the ecosystem. Li Zhongqiu gave an example. The common bird, the white-headed bulbul, is a bit annoying in daily life - vehicles parked under the camphor trees are often attacked by the bird droppings &quot;bombs&quot; of the white-headed bulbul. But the Bald Bulbul is an important functional bird in the ecosystem, and its excrement can help plant seeds spread several kilometers away. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“We always focus on humans and talk about whether a species is useful to us.” Li Zhongqiu said, “Every species living on the earth has its function and value. The more common it is, the more common it is. The more valuable a species is, we cannot ignore them living around us just because they are common.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 13 Oct 2023 17:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[孙卓、符建涛被拐案宣判：两名被告分别被判刑5年、2年]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258520]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-13 16:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;On October 13, 2023, the Shenzhen Nanshan District People’s Court prosecuted the defendant Wu Moulong for abducting children and The first-instance public verdict was made in the case of Wu Mouguang&#39;s cover-up.

In &quot;Good Things Come in Twos&quot;, the scumbag husband Wei Ming teams up with his first wife Lin Shuang and his mistress Jiang Xi - the former is an unthinking stereotype, and the latter is a crude setting that takes it for granted to cater to feminism. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In &quot;Doctor Foster&quot;, Gemma did not rely on anyone. She was calm and composed in the great pain, and she calmly tried to find ways to regain what she had lost. Everything ended in the fact that the mistress was pregnant with her husband&#39;s child in front of her husband, mistress and mistress&#39;s family. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Besides this main line, there are other extramarital affairs patterns in &quot;Doctor Foster&quot;.
