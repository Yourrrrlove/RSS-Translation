The four lanes of the railway freight yard were filled with trains waiting for entry and exit, and subsequent trains waiting for admission sounded their whistles in the distance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/EZXRelpVvmcOYVYSip9HBnFRDsa5IZRPBoZ79QCu.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;540&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/EZXRelpVvmcOYVYSip9HBnFRDsa5IZRPBoZ79QCu.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250558&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Horgos Railway Port and surrounding freight yards&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Zhang Jia/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; There is a 1,050-meter-long supervision road running through the east and west ends of the freight yard. As the deputy of the third team on duty at the Horgos Entry-Exit Border Inspection Station (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: italics, italics_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;hereinafter referred to as the &quot;Horgos Border Inspection Station&quot;&lt;/span>;) Captain, Yue Shuang has been on this road for 11 years and witnessed the opening and development of the railway port. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Horgos has a customs clearance history of more than 100 years and is my country’s closest and most convenient window to Central Asia, West Asia and even Europe. In July 2012, Yue Shuang, who had just graduated from the military academy, was assigned to the Horgos Border Inspection Station. At that time, this border town had a sparse population. Most shops were closed after 10 p.m., and “there were no people eating noodles on the street.” There is no place.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/qjKUBwucyDgNE2lVo40qHUiVplDQZLmcvakaf6S3.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width= &quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/qjKUBwucyDgNE2lVo40qHUiVplDQZLmcvakaf6S3.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250557&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt; p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Before going to work, Yue Shuang checks the police appearance and discipline&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Zhang Jia/picture)&lt;/span >;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On December 22, 2012, the Horgos Railway Port opened for trial operation. Yue Shuang was among the first batch of policemen stationed at the scene. There were only four railway tracks, one guard bridge and a temporary structure in the vast Gobi. color steel house. According to the agreement between China and Kazakhstan, the railway port implemented a 7-day × 12-hour service model at that time, but there were only seven or eight inbound and outbound freight trains every day. Yue Shuang used &quot;boring&quot; to describe the work at that time, &quot;There was not much business volume, but it was very tiring.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The change occurred in 2014, when the railway port was officially opened in February of that year. Yue Shuang still remembers that the number of trains that summer more than doubled than before, and the number continued to grow. The background of this change is that China proposed the joint construction of the &quot;Belt and Road&quot; initiative in 2013, and Horgos is located in the &quot;core area&quot; of the &quot;New Silk Road Economic Belt&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/WO9Y5ktr951A1xtFgbFggEZnfeaSqjKbqpjUGkbj.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/WO9Y5ktr951A1xtFgbFggEZnfeaSqjKbqpjUGkbj.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250553&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Check the front of the truck to prevent hiding illegal items&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Zhang Jia/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Huo Ergos means &quot;the place where the camel caravan passes&quot; in Mongolian.

The police had to climb into the carriages one by one and check the bottom of the carriages to prevent criminals or prohibited items from hiding in them and illegal entry and exit. It took more than half an hour to inspect a train. Later, they formed a mature inspection process, strengthened technological means, and carried out comprehensive monitoring of inbound and outbound trains. Now it only takes about 10 minutes to inspect a train. In order to better adapt to the growing demand for customs clearance, the border inspection station has adjusted the railway port to a 365-day × 24-hour service model, so that entry and exit trains can be inspected and released at any time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/1eF7ZbQvGlj1T8fCvN2CBPnzdGYnDZDn2hnXiIRB.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;607&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/1eF7ZbQvGlj1T8fCvN2CBPnzdGYnDZDn2hnXiIRB.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250561&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Check the identity of the outbound truck driver&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Zhang Jia/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Spring and Autumn Return Well, the most difficult parts are summer and winter.&quot; Yue Shuang said that the highest temperature in summer at the duty site is over 50 degrees Celsius, eggs can be fried on the railway tracks, and people often faint at the duty site; in winter, the lowest temperature drops to more than 30 degrees below zero. degrees Celsius, when the police inspected the car, their hands were accidentally stuck to the iron sheet of the carriage. If they tore it apart with force, bloody skin and flesh would be left on the carriage. In December 2018, the port encountered a blizzard with more than 70 centimeters of snow. In order not to affect the normal operation of the train, the police cleared the snow all night. Everyone was covered with thick ice when they returned. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To the northwest of the railway port, about two kilometers away in a straight line, stands the sixth-generation national gate that was opened in September 2018. Hundreds of trucks leave the country from highway ports every day, transporting Chinese products to Central Asia and Europe. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/Sdb8D0QuKty04rr4pXZlh6X3aDOCxCsI4vXRGoE5.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/Sdb8D0QuKty04rr4pXZlh6X3aDOCxCsI4vXRGoE5.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250556&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Highway Passenger Transport Duty Site&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Zhang Jia/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Border of Horgos Zeng Qi, captain of the second team on duty at the inspection station, has witnessed the changes from the fifth generation to the sixth generation of the national gate. In his opinion, the design concept of the new national gate is more advanced. Passengers only need to scan their fingerprints and faces to clear customs in just 15 seconds; trucks adopt one-stop inspection and one-time customs clearance to improve customs clearance efficiency. From January 1 to July 21, 2023, the number of entry and exit vehicles at the port exceeded 100,000, exceeding the annual customs clearance volume of highway ports in previous years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“There are many potential changes that cannot be seen at ordinary times.” Zeng Qi said. In the past, export commodities were mainly fruits and vegetables, department stores and various daily necessities, but now they include building materials, machinery and equipment, precision instruments, etc. Among them, Chinese-made new energy vehicles are especially popular with countries along the “Belt and Road”. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/WKPqmSzsnAkezItMKQ5VwS3AhY40YNpCDOQrwJIm.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/WKPqmSzsnAkezItMKQ5VwS3AhY40YNpCDOQrwJIm.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250555&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Vehicles of various types waiting to leave the country in front of the sixth-generation national gate&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Zhang Jia/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What touched Zeng Qi most deeply was one day in May 2023. As he was getting off work, there was still a long queue of vehicles waiting to clear customs. They urgently met and negotiated with the Kazakh border inspection department and obtained the other party&#39;s consent to extend the customs clearance time. When the news came, the drivers waiting for customs clearance in front of the boundary bridge applauded in unison. They worked until about 5 a.m. the next day, and finally completed the inspection and release of all vehicles to be inspected. &quot;Seeing so many Chinese products leaving us, no matter how tiring it is, it&#39;s worth it.&quot; On August 15, 2023, the Horgos Highway Port began to implement 24-hour freight customs clearance on a trial basis. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2023 is the tenth anniversary of the joint construction of the “Belt and Road” initiative. With the continuous growth of port customs clearance, more and more tourists are visiting Horgos, and &quot;gold diggers&quot; from various countries are also pouring in. This border town is undergoing rapid changes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yue Shuang once went out of the country to meet with the Kazakh border inspection department, and it was already night when he returned. He stood in the dark wilderness outside the country and looked at Horgos. It was brightly lit and bustling with traffic, making it a veritable &quot;city that never sleeps.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 16 Sep 2023 23:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[胡适与吴鼎昌父子刘廷芳兄弟：从吴元黎旧藏《四十自述》说起]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256625]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-16 22:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/13/LL1yxLVpALUNrKyeCE83Pod4zXgpgeFhBJuc4Sss.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1200&quot; height=&quot;882&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/LL1yxLVpALUNrKyeCE83Pod4zXgpgeFhBJuc4Ss s. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250684&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Hu Shi signed and presented Wu Yuanli&#39;s &quot;Autobiography of Forty&quot;. The picture on the right is young Wu Yuanli. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Mr. Liu Rongqian, who is far away in Canada, left me a message on WeChat not long ago: &quot;I am now eighty-six years old, so I should take advantage of the opportunity before I have dementia. &quot;I&#39;m going to sort out the relics left by my elders in the family. There are some old books among them. I chose three to give to you.&quot; He knew that I loved books, so he joked: &quot;A sword is given to a hero.&quot; It happened that a Chinese friend returned to China to visit relatives, and Liu My husband asked her to take it with her and deliver it to me when she got home. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Within a few days, I received three books from Nantong: one was the 1935 edition of Kang Youwei&#39;s &quot;Book of Datong&quot; by Zhonghua Book Company. The front and back covers had fallen off, and the title page had the words &quot;Wu &quot;Huansheng&quot; is printed in white. One is the 1943 edition of Chiang Kai-shek&#39;s &quot;The Destiny of China&quot; by Zhengzhong Bookstore. There is a calligraphy inscription on the title page: &quot;Brother Zhao Jinyong Huicun, brother Liang Kui respectfully presents it.&quot; Zhao Jinyong and Liang Kui were both diplomats during the Republic of China. There is also a 1959 edition of Hu Shi&#39;s &quot;Autobiography at Forty&quot; published by Far East Book Company, which is actually signed by Hu Shi. The last invoice was made by Wu Yuanli, Mr. Liu Rongqian&#39;s uncle, and the invoice was signed on May 31, 1960. Inside the book is a copy of Mao Zishui&#39;s &quot;Three Years After the Death of Mr. Hu Shizhi&quot; published in the third issue of Volume 6 of &quot;Biographical Literature&quot;. This was beyond my expectation. I have been thinking about Hu Shi’s autographed book for a long time, but I didn’t expect that it was Mr. Liu Rongqian who helped me realize my dream. These three books were all collected by Wu Yuanli. Mr. Liu Rongqian told me that after his uncle (Editor&#39;s note: Wu Yuanli) passed away in the United States, he went to California to help his cousin deal with his uncle&#39;s belongings and asked for it from his cousin. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Check the &quot;First Draft of the Long Chronicle of Mr. Hu Shizhi&quot; (Supplementary Edition) compiled by Hu Songping. It says on June 1, 1960: &quot;Wu Yuanli and Liu Tingwei came to see him. Yuanli was Wu Dingchang (Da). (Quan)’s son, let’s talk about Wu Tat-quan’s autobiography &quot;Huaxi Xianbi&quot;.&quot; It can be seen that Hu Shi prepared the book a day in advance, and the gift of &quot;Autobiography at Forty&quot; was also a thoughtful and meaningful move. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hu Shi and Wu Yuanli did not have a close relationship and may have only met once or twice. On June 19, 1949, they met in the United States. Hu Shi did not have too many records in his diary. He only wrote: &quot;5:30 &amp;nbsp;Mr. Wu (Son of Da Quan).&quot; At this time, the Nationalist Government had withdrawn from Nanjing and Hu Shi arrived in the United States. On June 21, Hu Shi telegraphed his resignation as Foreign Minister to the new Executive Yuan Yan Xishan, who was retreating to Guangzhou. But Hu Shi should have heard about Wu Yuanli&#39;s deeds. On the morning of July 1, 1959, he attended the fourth academician meeting of Academia Sinica and served as the chairman of the meeting. At the meeting, Jiang Shuojie reported on the research status of Chinese economists in the United States and mentioned many talents in economics, including Wu Yuanli. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/KQukqc6kLu6aOF9pBLBRSMm3uroyeMm8Jxnk6R1u.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;628&quot; height= &quot;1028&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/KQukqc6kLu6aOF9pBLBRSMm3uroyeMm8Jxnk6R1u.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250679&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Wu Dingchang (back row, right), Chen Shiyun (middle seat) and his wife take a photo with their daughter Wu Yuanjun (back row, left), son-in-law Liu Tingwei (back row, center), and son Wu Yuanli (front row, right) . &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wu Yuanli was born in Shanghai in 1920. He studied at Shanghai Nanyang Middle School and St. John&#39;s University in his early years, and later went to England for further study. In 1942, he received a first-class honors degree in economics from the University of London. In 1946, he received a doctorate in economics and was a disciple of Hayek. After returning to China, he served in the Central Bank. In 1949, he moved to the United States and became a professor in the Department of Economics at the University of San Francisco. Chen Yuxian divided the Chinese experts who studied Sinology in North America into five major groups. The second group was &quot;around the founding of the People&#39;s Republic of China. A group of scholars who studied or taught in church universities migrated to North America. They encountered the expansion of North American institutions of higher learning after World War II.&quot; Soon, they became fluent in both Chinese and English and settled in various universities, becoming the backbone of Chinese studies in each school.&quot; Wu Yuanli is the leader in this second group. Since 1960, Wu Yuanli has served as a researcher and consultant at the Hoover Institution of Stanford University. He used the rich collections of the Hoover Library to write books such as &quot;Overseas Chinese and the Economic Development of Southeast Asia&quot;, &quot;The Role of the Chinese in the Economic Development of Southeast Asia&quot; and &quot;Taiwan: Towards an Industrialized Society&quot;. Precisely because of Wu Yuanli&#39;s superb research on China issues, he served as the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense of the United States from 1969 to 1970. In 1985, Wu Yuanli won the Humboldt Foundation Research Award in Germany. In November 2008, Wu Yuanli accidentally fell and caused intracranial hemorrhage. He died at Stanford University Hospital in California on the 18th at the age of 88. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/3BQKBU2VVI5x5r8qEWYPN7BSq3FboPaO0bFfSg1A.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1104&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/3BQKBU2VVI5x5r8qEWYPN7BSq3FboPaO0bFfSg1A.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250683&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;A group photo of Wu and Liu families.

He said that when he was a child, he lived with his grandparents in Guiyang (Editor&#39;s note: referring to Wu Dingchang and his wife, Wu was the chairman of Guizhou Province at the time). One day the postman delivered a silver-gray box with a piece of coffee cake and a lot of dried fruits. His grandmother told him this It was sent from London by my uncle, and I still haven&#39;t forgotten the sweet taste. After the war of resistance against Japan was over in Nanjing, his uncle brought back his aunt with blue eyes and blond hair. This was the first time he saw his uncle and the first time he talked directly to &quot;foreigners&quot;. He felt strange. Later, his uncle went to the United States, and his family went to live in Taiwan. In 1962, my grandmother passed away, and my uncle returned to Taiwan to attend the funeral. In 1965, he was studying in Paris. His uncle and aunt came to see him. They saw that he was studying design during the day and working in a hotel at night. His life was difficult. His uncle suggested that he go to the United States to study economics instead. It would be easier to find a job after graduation and it would also help He lends a helping hand. He answered his uncle: &quot;I can only draw.&quot; In 1965, Liu Rongqian immigrated to Canada. A few years later, he brought his parents to live in Canada. His uncle would come to visit relatives every year. After Mr. Liu&#39;s parents passed away, he often visited his uncle in California, chatted with him, and discussed the foundation to commemorate Wu Chen Shiyun (Editor&#39;s note: Wu Dingchang&#39;s wife). When his uncle passed away, he was in Beijing and did not have time to attend the funeral. Later, he went to California to help his cousin, who did not understand Chinese, organize a house full of Chinese books and materials. Mr. Liu said that his uncle kept a low profile throughout his life, moved and spoke softly, was good at listening and asking questions, and was very caring about his younger generations. &quot;Perhaps my uncle studied in England when he was young and was influenced by the British&#39;s cold humor. He would often make people laugh unexpectedly during conversations. I remember that in Paris that year, we were sitting in an outdoor cafe. He said that Paris was very interesting. Half of the Parisians were sitting there. Watching the other half of Paris in a cafe. If I could describe my impression of my uncle in one sentence: he is a gentleman with a sense of humor.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hu Shi and Wu Yuanli&#39;s father, Wu Dingchang, are old acquaintances and spoke highly of him. On February 26, 1931, Cao Heheng invited Ke Shaobin, Zheng Xiaoxu, Jiang Han, Yang Zhongxi and others to have dinner together. He also invited Wu Dingchang and Hu Shi. This was the first time they met. Hu Shi&#39;s diary recorded on that day: &quot;Wu Jun is a capable man. I have wanted to see him for a long time, but I have disagreed many times. Today I met him for the first time.&quot; Wu Dingchang is seven or eight years older than Hu Shi. He is an industrialist and banker and has served as the Bank of China. President, General Manager of Salt Bank, and Deputy Minister of Finance of the Beijing Government. Later, he acquired &quot;Ta Kung Pao&quot; and appointed himself as president. He invited Hu Zhengzhi as general manager and Zhang Jiluan as editor-in-chief, giving &quot;Ta Kung Pao&quot; a new life and becoming one of the most influential newspapers in the country. Therefore, Hu Shi was left with a &quot;competent&quot; impression. In November of that year, the Nanjing National Government established a Finance Committee, with Hu Shi and Wu Dingchang as members. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/gvp2av25spnjzLea2PNQn5ygS6DkCvKHe2kwJAk4.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;479&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/gvp2av25spnjzLea2PNQn5ygS6DkCvKHe2kwJAk4.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250682&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Liu Tingwei and Wu Yuanjun wedding photos. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of Liu Rongqian)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On June 11, 1933, on the eve of Hu Shi’s visit to the United States, he passed through Tianjin. Wu Dingchang went to visit specifically. They &quot;talked for more than two o&#39;clock&quot;, and Wu Dingchang &quot;advocated &#39;returning power to the people&#39; the most vigorously, and also advocated the temporary suspension of many construction projects.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On January 31, 1934, Hu Shi and Wu Dingchang met at Wang Jingwei&#39;s official residence in Nanjing. Also present were Zhang Jiluan, Ren Hongjun, Chen Hengzhe, Tang Youren, Zeng Zhongming, etc. They discussed foreign and domestic issues. . The meaning is still not finished. After leaving, Hu Shi and Wu Dingchang talked late at night when they returned to their apartment. At that time, Sino-Japanese relations were becoming increasingly tense, and there were many different voices regarding foreign and domestic policies. Hu Shi and Wu Dingchang obviously had different opinions, but this did not affect Hu Shi&#39;s good impression of Wu Dingchang. In July of that year, Hu Shi wrote &quot;From Private School to Yenching University&quot;. When talking about private donations to build schools, he cited the example of Wu Dingchang: &quot;Those with more money can renovate a university. ... Those with less money can also subsidize a specific school.&quot; A certain part, such as Mr. Wu Dingchang’s donation to the Department of Economics of Nankai University for student aid. In this way, a small amount can add up to a large amount, making the already successful school become even more successful.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hu Shi, Wu Yuanli and Liu Tingwei The &quot;Huaxi Xianbi&quot; mentioned was written by Wu Dingchang when he was the chairman of the Guizhou Provincial Government. It was published by Guizhou Daily in October 1940. It has &quot;when taking office&quot;, &quot;after taking office&quot;, &quot;province&quot; and &quot;county&quot;. There are seven chapters in &quot;Central Administration and Local Governments&quot;, &quot;Miscellaneous Thoughts&quot; and &quot;Postscript&quot;. Three years later, Hu Zhengzhi persuaded Wu Dingchang to continue writing &quot;Huaxi Xianbi&quot;, so there were nine chapters in the &quot;Continuation&quot;, namely &quot;Provincial Government&quot;, &quot;Counties and Towns&quot;, &quot;New County System&quot;, &quot;Counties and Townships&quot;, &quot;New Life&quot;, &quot;Public Security and Gangs&quot;, &quot;Economy and Control&quot;, &quot;Finance and Accounting&quot; and &quot;Miscellaneous Feelings&quot; were published by Guizhou Enterprise Co., Ltd. Printing Office in October 1943. Wu Dingchang ran a newspaper, and it is said that his poetry and prose were very good. Cao Juren said: &quot;I read the sequel to his &quot;Huaxi Xianbi&quot; and liked his simplicity and closeness. His female son-in-law collected his poems and distributed them to the best. After reading them, I felt that there were no empty scholars in his name. After leaving Guizhou, Wu Dingchang served as the civil servant of the National Government, Secretary-General of the Central Design Bureau of the Kuomintang, and Secretary-General of the Presidential Office. He once suggested to Chiang Kai-shek that he invite Mao Zedong to Chongqing for negotiations. In January 1949, retired Wu Dingchang came to live in Hong Kong at the urging of his son. On August 22, 1950, Wu Dingchang died of cancer in Hong Kong. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/WrMFUIDTySoVmp3a1GM2tmUVYsCQiSp4eHl8e3wK.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;610&quot; height= &quot;927&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/WrMFUIDTySoVmp3a1GM2tmUVYsCQiSp4eHl8e3wK.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250681&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Brothers Liu Tingfang (left) and Liu Tingwei (right). &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of Liu Rongqian/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu Tingwei, who went to visit Hu Shi with Wu Yuanli, was not introduced in Hu Shi&#39;s diary. Liu Tingwei is the son-in-law of Wu Dingchang and the father of Mr. Liu Rongqian. He was born in 1903 and was a native of Wenzhou, Zhejiang. After graduating from Yanjing University, he studied at Cornell University in the United States and received a doctorate in entomology. After completing his studies, he returned to China and served successively as professor in the Department of Biology of Hujiang University, technical director of the Nanjing Central Agricultural Experimental Institute, technical director of the Guizhou Work Station of the Central Agricultural Experimental Institute, and technical director of the Agricultural Group of the Agricultural Society. After the Agricultural Restoration Association moved to Taiwan in 1949, Liu Tingwei served as the leader of the first group and later the plant production group until his retirement in 1965. Liu Tingwei is also a poet. His poems are highly praised by Tao Xingzhi, Xu Zhimo and Shen Congwen. He has published poetry collections &quot;Mountain Flowers&quot; and &quot;My Cup&quot;. His wife, Wu Yuanjun, was the eldest daughter of Wu Dingchang. She was born in 1912. She studied at Yenching University and was a classmate of Zhou Yiliang. She was quite talented and assisted Rong Geng in editing the &quot;Continuation of Bronze Inscriptions&quot; when they were in school. The daughter Cao Juren mentioned was Wu Yuanjun who printed a collection of poems for Wu Dingchang. Liu Tingwei and Wu Yuanjun got married in July 1933 and stayed together for the rest of their lives. In their later years, they lived with their children in Canada and the United States. In January 1994, Liu Tingwei passed away in Canada. In December 2001, Wu Yuanjun passed away in the United States. Both lived into their nineties. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hu Shi has no direct interaction with Liu Tingwei, but he is very familiar with his eldest brother Liu Tingfang. When Liu Tingfang was a teenager, he was highly appreciated by Su Huilian, Cai Bomin, Stuart Leighton and others. Stuart recommended him to study at St. John&#39;s University in Shanghai, and later arranged for him to study in the United States. Liu Tingfang received a bachelor&#39;s degree and a master&#39;s degree from Columbia University in the United States, a bachelor&#39;s degree in divinity from Yale Divinity School, and a doctorate in educational psychology from Columbia University. After returning to China, he worked at Yenching University with Leighton Stuart and was an important assistant to Leighton Stuart in starting the cause of Yenching University. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/kzPxt48fnGol2uq1muiA1nHoLJfOKkF0tqevZMwr.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;525&quot; height= &quot;815&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/kzPxt48fnGol2uq1muiA1nHoLJfOKkF0tqevZMwr.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250680&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Wu Yuanli in his later years. In the 1940s, Wu Yuanli advocated giving rights to the poor and allowing them to develop freely. Another famous economist, Fang Xianting, advocated relying on elite planning to develop the economy and letting the elites make decisions for the poor. The debate between the two ended with Fang Xianting gaining the upper hand. Wu Yuanli retreated to the United States, and his name was gradually forgotten. It was not until 2007 that American historian of economic thought Paul Trescott rediscovered Wu Yuanli and believed that the Wu Fang debate was the earliest debate in the history of development economics. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(data map/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The earliest record about Liu Tingfang in Hu Shi&#39;s diary was on April 28, 1921: &quot;Went to Liu Tingfang&#39;s house for dinner. Liu Jun is in charge of religious studies, and his family has many books on religious history.&quot; On May 18 of the same year: &quot;In the morning, Mr. Stuart, Pastor Liu Tingfang and Mr. Huo Jinde came to talk.&quot; On June 30 of the same year, Peking University, the Men&#39;s and Women&#39;s Normal Schools, the Shangzhi Society, the New Society, etc. held a farewell party for the Dewey family at Jinyuxuan in Central Park. Hu Shi, Liu Tingfang, and Wu Zhuosheng were all there. Hu Shi, representing Peking University, translated it into Chinese and spoke it again. Wu Zhuosheng delivered a speech on behalf of the Women&#39;s Normal University, which was translated into Chinese by Liu Tingfang. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1921, Yenching University wanted to improve the Department of Chinese Language and Culture. Stuart Leighton and Liu Tingfang invited Hu Shi to take charge of the work, but Hu Shi did not agree and recommended Zhou Zuoren instead. He thought it was a pity that Zhou Zuoren could not use his talents at Peking University, so he asked him to &quot;go out and do his own thing.&quot; Unfortunately, Zhou became ill, so the matter was put on hold for a year. The next year, Yanjing brought up the matter again, so on March 4, 1922, Hu Shi invited Stuart Leighton, Liu Tingfang, and Zhou Zuoren to introduce them and let them talk face to face. Hu Shi recorded in his diary: &quot;They were very satisfied with their discussion.&quot; Zhou Zuoren taught at Yan University for more than ten years until he was hired as a research professor by Peking University and could not take courses at other schools. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On January 11, 1937, Hu Shi &quot;went to eat at Liu Tingfang of Yan University.&quot; Since then, Liu Tingfang has not appeared in Hu Shi&#39;s diary. Liu Tingfang was later elected as a legislator, but due to poor health, he went to the United States for medical treatment in 1942. He died in a Presbyterian Hospital in New Mexico in 1947 at the age of fifty-six. I wonder if Hu Shi thought of his brother Liu Tingfang when he met Liu Tingwei. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Mr. Liu Rongqian currently lives in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, and has been inviting me to visit him. &quot;Don&#39;t forget that at my age, I&#39;m already counting down the days. Please make the trip as soon as possible.&quot; But I thought, he should go home as soon as possible while he can still move around. Liu Rongqian has lived overseas for a long time and has never been to his hometown of Wenzhou. In May 2015, he held the &quot;Unintentional Realm&quot; photography art exhibition in Hangzhou. I went to observe and learn from it, and took a quick look. Fortunately, there is WeChat, so we can communicate online at any time after we are separated. That was the closest Mr. Liu Rongqian was to his hometown. A few months ago, Professor Shen Weiwei of Nanjing University came to Wenzhou University to give a lecture and asked me to accompany him to look for Liu Tingfang’s old traces. That area is undergoing renovation of a historical district, and the small bungalow Liu Tingfang built for his mother after returning to China is no longer accessible. Professor Shen saw a corner of Liu&#39;s former residence through the bathroom window of an office building. Therefore, please Mr. Liu Rongqian &quot;make the trip as soon as possible&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 16 Sep 2023 22:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[贵州省委政法委原副书记刘文新被“双开”]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256866]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-16 21:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;According to the Guizhou Provincial Commission for Discipline Inspection and Supervision: Recently, with the approval of the Guizhou Provincial Party Committee, the Guizhou Provincial Commission for Discipline Inspection and Supervision Liu Wenxin, former deputy secretary of the Political and Legal Affairs Committee of the Provincial Party Committee, has been investigated for serious violations of discipline and law. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After investigation, Liu Wenxin lost his ideals and beliefs, abandoned his duties and missions, alienated himself from the party and the people, acted on his own initiative, acted arbitrarily and illegally, engaged in &quot;seven things&quot;, and became a destroyer of the political ecology and economic order. ; Being disloyal and dishonest to the Party, being two-faced, resisting organizational censorship, engaging in feudal superstitious activities, privately possessing and reading books and periodicals with serious political issues; Ignoring the spirit of the eight central regulations, accepting violations that may affect the fair execution of official duties Arrange banquets, travel and activities, violate the work and life security system, seek special treatment, advocate hedonism, fly first class in violation of regulations; have no organizational principles, fail to truthfully explain problems when organizing conversations, fail to truthfully report major personal matters, violate regulations Transferring work for others; losing integrity, accepting gifts and money in violation of regulations, having bad morals, living an extremely corrupt life, engaging in power, sex, and money transactions, having long-term improper sexual relations with others, whoring, gambling; playing with things, being obsessed with knives; violating regulations Allocating fees to enterprises, intervening in violation of regulations and intervening in judicial activities.

Although the Serbian team failed to win the final victory in the decisive battle, in this World Cup they made it all the way to the final in the absence of several top stars, which once again proved the amazing strength of this veteran European team. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some are happy and some are sad. The Chinese men’s basketball team ranked only 29th among the 32 participating teams. The coach is Alexander Djordje, the famous coach who holds the Lifetime Achievement Award of the Serbian Basketball Coaches Association. Vicky, for him and the Chinese men&#39;s basketball team, the trip to the Philippines World Cup was full of frustration and depression. The Chinese men&#39;s basketball team lost to Serbia 63-105 in the first game of the World Cup. This day happened to be Lao Qiao&#39;s 56th birthday. Before the game, many members of the Serbian team sent blessings to the legend, but after the game started, the birthday boy could only shake his head. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On November 16, 2022, the Chinese Basketball Association made adjustments to the head coach of the Chinese Men’s Basketball National Team and announced the selection of Djordjevic as the head coach of the Chinese Men’s Basketball National Team. His task is to lead the Chinese men&#39;s basketball team in the sixth window of the 2023 Men&#39;s Basketball World Cup qualifying period and the 2023 Men&#39;s Basketball World Cup, striving to lead the team to qualify for the 2024 Paris Olympics. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Chinese men’s basketball team spent a lot of money to hire a world-class coach to lead the army, and naturalized NBA star Kyle Lee joined the team.

At the same time, he lost his Olympic ticket again and fell into the abyss. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Chinese men’s basketball team performed poorly in the last Olympic cycle and failed to qualify for the Tokyo Olympics. This time it failed to qualify for the Paris Olympics, which means that a generation of players cannot participate in the highest level during their golden period of competition. competition. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past, when participating in the Olympic Games, the flag bearer of the Chinese delegation would be a tall and handsome Chinese men&#39;s basketball star. Now, the Chinese men&#39;s basketball team, which has missed two consecutive Olympics, has even lost a standard-bearer who can guide the direction - veteran Yi Jianlian, who was unable to go with the team, announced his retirement before the last game of the Chinese men&#39;s basketball group stage. Fans lamented that since before the Olympics, Without being able to compete for eight to eight years, the glory of the Chinese men&#39;s basketball team has completely faded. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;How should the Chinese men’s basketball team move forward? &quot;Southern People Weekly&quot; conducted an exclusive interview with Gong Luming, the famous Chinese basketball coach. At the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, at the age of 39, he directed the Chinese team to reach the top eight in the Olympics for the first time. This is the best record that has not been broken so far. This group of players is also known as the &quot;96 Golden Generation&quot;. When the Chinese men&#39;s basketball team hit a trough in 2014, he was asked to come out. A year later, he once again brought the Chinese men&#39;s basketball team back to the top in Asia. This legendary guard, who is only 1.72 meters tall, is known as the &quot;fire-fighting master&quot; of Chinese basketball. In 1999, he became the head coach at the lowest point when the Chinese women&#39;s basketball team lost the qualification to compete in the Sydney Olympics. Through major changes and all-round team building, he created a young and brave golden generation of women&#39;s basketball, winning the 2001 Asian Women&#39;s Basketball Championship and the 2001 Women&#39;s Basketball Asian Championship. He won two titles at the 2002 Asian Games and finished sixth at the 2002 World Championships. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The following is the self-report of coach Gong Luming:&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;1&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>; I personally strongly agree with the strengthening of international exchanges in Chinese basketball. It is a good thing for the Chinese Basketball Association to hire foreign coaches, especially famous foreign coaches. They can bring us a lot of good experience in terms of confrontation, concepts, and methods. . However, some practical factors must be taken into consideration on how to properly coordinate the coaching team and how to give full play to the role of foreign teachers. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;The specialty of foreign coaches is high professionalism, concentration and seriousness, and their coaching level is also certain He was selected by the Chinese Basketball Association only after he has reached a certain height. There is no doubt about this. Most of them grew up in a highly professional basketball environment and believe that everyone in the team, including themselves, has sufficient professionalism. After assembling a national team, foreign teachers rarely think that the construction and management of the team and the improvement of athletes&#39; skills are also one of the priorities of the head coach. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;They are more accustomed to focusing on the court, such as the tactical system, lineup configuration, and opponents.

To be honest, they may not necessarily like our Chinese coaches, so we will see that the foreign head coaches are very dedicated and very courageous to carry out their work, but there are very few opportunities for Chinese and foreign coaches to formally exchange opinions or communicate. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;From our past experience, if a foreign teacher serves as an assistant coach, he will actively communicate with the head coach To communicate, he will actively communicate with the Chinese coaching staff the various information he has seen and collected, as well as how to deal with it. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Over the years, whether it is the national team or local clubs, our basketball world has formed such a The coaching environment: Unless the Chinese coach is very proactive and actively cooperates with the foreign teacher and asks the foreign teacher for advice, he may talk more to the Chinese coach. If you don&#39;t do this and you just follow the foreign teacher, he will not actually give you any help. But if the Chinese side is the head coach, the foreign teacher will actively communicate with you about his experience, knowledge or methods. This is a very realistic thing. Such a coaching culture has been formed over the years. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Another point is that even if there are no foreign teachers, the coaching staff is all local coaches. There is also an unwritten rule. I am used to following the arrangements of the head coach. To put it simply, if you don’t arrange things, I won’t do it. If the head coach has spoken and arranged for me, I will do it. If the head coach does not ask for it, then the assistant coach will not express his opinion easily. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;These are our &quot;basketball culture&quot;. When hiring foreign teachers, you must consider these practical factors. In fact, it is very difficult. There has been a consensus within the circle for a long time that foreign teachers can be used and the ball can be lost, but the initiative must be in our own hands. Even if we lose, we must let our own coaches know how to lose. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/O4yeTzwTaxr80Zv1c1vc6sHZGmgOxdACXvM7x0pw.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/O4yeTzwTaxr80Zv1c1vc6sHZGmgOxdACXvM7x0pw.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250580&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On October 3, 2015, in Changsha, Hunan, the Chinese men&#39;s basketball team won the 2015 Asian Men&#39;s Basketball Championship.

On the way, he talked about Guinan School, which is located at the foot of Wugui Mountain in Zhongshan City. The implication is that this private primary and secondary school has an average admission rate. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I have heard too many of the same stories. Designer and school art group teacher Zhang Yaoren could only smile helplessly. What is good and what is bad? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Achievements&quot; are always the only yardstick for most people. Zhang Yaoren didn’t think so. He is thin, in his fifties, and has been at Guinan School for more than five years. Old P, as people like to call him, is from Henan. He has been in Guangdong for more than thirty years. He settled in nearby Qixi Village a few years ago. He and Shi Lei, the principal of Guinan School, hit it off on this topic: &quot;Do children in rural areas need... Need aesthetic education?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/16/vMCE1SIISojaA1pyEdXttSCFwmE6MrnjJsd4NQjL.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 960&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/16/vMCE1SIISojaA1pyEdXttSCFwmE6MrnjJsd4NQjL.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250958&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Works by Guinan School students. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of interviewee)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Independent artist and curator Guan Yong is in his forties, has a tall figure and likes to wear Straw sandals. He has been engaged in art education since he was nineteen years old, working in kindergartens, primary schools, and art galleries in Zhuhai, Guangzhou, Macau and other places. Later, he also participated in this miniature rural aesthetic education experiment as an art director. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Initially, Guinan School had more than 40 classes, more than 1,700 students, and 3 art teachers, but there was no art classroom. In July 2018, Guinan School converted six classrooms on the first floor into art classrooms. Now, the school has eight full-time art teachers, four studios and a reading room. The teaching content involves traditional Chinese painting, printmaking, pottery, paper-cutting, etc. Guinan&#39;s campus also has a miniature art gallery that displays students&#39; works. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When visiting this place, Southern Weekend reporters were surprised by the art works hidden on campus. These works are displayed all over the campus. A large number of clay sculptures are dried on the ground, prints are posted on the walls, installation art is hung in the corridors, and handmade works are posted under the eaves. These works are quite childish, and the largest number are clay sculptures, including cups, plates, bottles, jars, and various clay figures with strange shapes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/16/Up3LZQx8CNfkgURkqUALPuYpCgqb4Tv173RGEIYA.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/16/Up3LZQx8CNfkgURkqUALPuYpCgqb4Tv173RGEIYA.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250959&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Student art works in the corridor of the teaching building of Guinan School. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of interviewee)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the comprehensive studio, weaving, sewing, embroidery and other handicrafts are completed here; folk crafts The studio is for students; the folk art room is filled with students&#39; prints, paper-cuts, etc.; in the comprehensive painting studio, you can see Chinese paintings, watercolors, oil paintings and other works by students. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/16/K4RhNWazPNxMQUDqRo9O4X3j0zIZBlSXxoWguIr8.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;720&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/16/K4RhNWazPNxMQUDqRo9O4X3j0zIZBlSXxoWguIr8.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250963&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Student prints from Guinan School. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern Weekend reporter Zhang Rui/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If you travel through the countryside, you can also see the works of students. &quot;Children&#39;s things are natural things.&quot; Zhang Yaoren pointed to the student works along the country road and said, &quot;(In the past) many paintings on the walls were relatively stiff.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In August 2023, Guan Yong and others started a rural teacher program to provide teaching support to front-line teachers from rural areas and plan to complete the training of one thousand teachers within two years. Zhang Yaoren said: &quot;We do the Thousand Talents Plan precisely because we believe that (aesthetic education) is the most important thing.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;If you have never done carpentry, you will do carpentry; if you have never played in mud, you will play in mud.&quot;&lt;/h4 >; &lt;p>;Local children mostly choose to go to public schools in towns. The students recruited by Guinan School are basically the children of migrant workers. Most of these students come from Sichuan, Hunan, Anhui and other places. Their parents left their hometown and came to the Pearl River Delta. While the students are in class, their parents sell things at nearby markets, work in factories, and do odd jobs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhang Yaoren recalled to Southern Weekend reporters that students would leave every semester. The fathers left the worksite, and the children flew away like birds. Academic performance has nothing to do with art. Zhang Yaoren said that they did not disclose the idea of ​​​​art courses to the parents of the students. He understands the parents’ thinking. Art is useless. It’s better to do more questions: “The parents must have said that my son only scored 85 points in math. Can you not let him attend the 90 minutes of art class? He might get 90 points in the exam. ”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Guan Yong has a point of view. Regarding the curriculum, the art textbooks compiled by the state are always the basis, accounting for 70% of the curriculum. The remaining 30% is carried out by the teaching team for outreach and expansion. The content of the 18 textbooks for grades one to nine was broken up and reconnected with the four studios. As the grades increase, the content offered by each studio becomes deeper. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/16/yPaKd9OGAQgZTSxdq2wI90zCjjZziTskqh66IZUd.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;720&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/16/yPaKd9OGAQgZTSxdq2wI90zCjjZziTskqh66IZUd.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250955&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Gouache painting by Guinan School students. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern Weekend reporter Zhang Rui/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;All the teaching materials were smashed and placed in the studio... The textbooks are relatively thin ,&quot; Zhang Yaoren gave an example, &quot;One class (textbook) says that the mud will be gone, but we asked the first-grade children to work here for four consecutive weeks making mud, and (the students) wanted to make bowls after finishing the cups. I also want to make a vessel with a handle, so that the child will have an understanding of the properties of clay, the complexity of materials, and the complexity of creation.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Improving teachers&#39; aesthetic and teaching abilities is the key . Five years ago, there were only two art teachers in Guinan School, and students would take out A4 paper to sketch in class. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;(Rural Art Teachers) Their professionalism is not deep. How come teachers who graduated from the National Academy of Arts and Central America come to our place? When the professional level of the teachers is not that high, how can Can you improve their level?&quot; Zhang Yaoren told the Southern Weekend reporter, &quot;Teach you how to work. If you have never done carpentry before, do carpentry, and if you have never played with mud, just play with mud.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Guan Yong et al. People prefer to refer to entering the classroom as entering the studio. They believe that art is the vocabulary of the adult world, while children&#39;s basic art education is &quot;enlightenment of students&#39; creativity and self-expression&quot; and is more like &quot;an artistic job&quot;. He rarely talks about art theory. When he encounters a problem, Guan Yong always says &quot;get moving&quot;. What should I do if I don’t have an art foundation? Guan Yong said, then work! As you dry it, you will feel it on your hands. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/16/1EySt6Joa4v1Qfj3z416218QnPl4KnxPxxZ1Z1UV.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/16/1EySt6Joa4v1Qfj3z416218QnPl4KnxPxxZ1Z1UV.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250957&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The art studio of Guinan School. Every time students finish class, they will clean up the studio as required. Zhang Yaoren believes that this is also part of aesthetic education. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of interviewee)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Guinan School does not add additional time for art classes, and of course does not allow preemption of art classes. time, students are required to complete a ninety-minute class once a week. Forty minutes of art class is simply not enough to keep children &quot;enjoyed.&quot; There is always an appreciation session at the beginning of the course. The teacher brings the pictures related to the curriculum to the children to “look at”. In nine years, students can look at tens of thousands of pictures, and these pictures become one of the sources of their aesthetic appreciation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, in the second grade course &quot;Paper Cutting - Transformation&quot;, students need to learn origami, binding, cutting and collage heads, and watch the works of Huang Yongyu, Komatsu Miu, Han Meilin and others; fifth grade The ninety-minute class in the first semester is titled &quot;Color Blow Molding - Vase Flowers&quot;. The teaching content includes engraving outlines and patterns. The materials viewed include the works of Davids, Van Gogh, Matisse, etc.; In the ninth-grade course &quot;Comprehensive Printmaking - Mask&quot;, students have to learn how to engrave lightness and grayscale, and watch the works of Gu Kaizhi, Wu Daozi, and Zhang Xuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are various equipment in the studio, including expensive printmaking machines, as well as various painting tools, glue guns, saws, etc. According to statistics, there are more than thirty kinds of paper. These materials come from Guinan School Expenditures. Zhang Yaoren said that the school has made great efforts&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/16/Q4vVA4zYwX0QyIXfpOnDVbYEIDsoi3KyR1mlocmq.jpg&quot; border =&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/16/Q4vVA4zYwX0QyIXfpOnDVbYEIDsoi3KyR1mlocmq.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250956&quot; >;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In the art studio of Guinan School, the drawers are filled with papers of various materials. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of interviewee)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, not every school has enough funding for materials. Some materials also come from the land. The art teacher took the students to collect leaves, soil, discarded paper, old clothes, plastic bottles, etc. Every semester, children in Guinan consume tons of soil. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The art teacher became the leader of the main subject&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Zhang Yaoren once visited some rural schools in western Guangdong, and the proportion of left-behind children in these schools accounted for more than 60%. In a central primary school in a certain town, there are only 180 students. In the context of &quot;dismantling sites and merging schools&quot;, data from NetEase Digital shows that in the forty years from 1976 to 2016, 916,000 primary schools disappeared in China, and most of them were rural primary schools. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many art teachers who participated in the training confirmed this statement to Southern Weekend reporters. A rural teacher in Hengyang, Hunan told a Southern Weekend reporter with sadness that her rural primary school will be merged next semester. She came in a hurry from other places with great expectations in her heart, wanting to bring something new to the children in the village. After working for four years, she watched the number of students drop from more than one hundred to more than thirty. She is a little envious of physical education classes. Campus football education is a Hengyang specialty. Almost every primary school is equipped with a football field and guaranteed physical education class hours. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Luo Xiaohong, the head of the Zhejiang Zhipu Charity Foundation, known as &quot;Huabu&quot;, has been paying attention to the life growth of rural children and the mental health of children in distress for many years. She told Southern Weekend reporters that six years ago, In a county in a mountainous area, there is only one full-time art teacher in all 20 rural primary schools in the countryside. There has been some improvement over the years, but there are still problems that need to be solved urgently. For example, there are 13 establishments in schools with less than 200 students. “Obviously, this (class arrangement) cannot be arranged no matter how you arrange it.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In rural schools, &quot;one teacher uses many people to use it.&quot; &quot;I am now the class teacher in charge of the first grade, responsible for reading classes, labor and skill classes, and also responsible for the quality promotion of our school,&quot; a teacher told a Southern Weekend reporter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When visiting rural schools, Zhang Yaoren found that some teachers who graduated from normal art schools had been teaching their main subjects for more than ten years and no longer taught art, while the original teachers of Chinese, mathematics and other subjects taught part-time instead. Art, music and other courses. Some former art teachers have even become subject leaders of their main subjects, and they “always have some regrets in their hearts” when talking about it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2020, the General Office of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the General Office of the State Council issued the &quot;Opinions on Comprehensively Strengthening and Improving School Aesthetic Education in the New Era.&quot; The opinions proposed that aesthetic education should be included in the entire process of talent training in schools of all levels and types, and should run through all stages of school education. A post-80s teacher from a public primary school in western Hunan is one of the second batch of local art students. I have been teaching for thirteen years and have taught foreign language and math all over the place. In the past two years, the school responded to the aesthetic education policy, and she was able to return to her profession and become a full-time art teacher, making up for her regret at the time: &quot;It&#39;s not that art has no threshold, it&#39;s because they think it doesn&#39;t matter if they don&#39;t teach well and there will be no consequences.&quot;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;Art education has always been considered a &quot;minor subject&quot;. In many cases, the class hours of minor subjects are often &quot;occupied&quot; by the main subjects. Especially in primary schools with limited educational resources, it is more common for the main subject teachers to concurrently serve as the teachers of the minor subjects. The encroachment of the minor subject class hours is &quot;natural&quot;. &quot;Many documents on aesthetic education have been issued at the national level, and it cannot be said that they are not taken seriously. Art teachers like to take art classes, and students also fall in love with art classes, but in many cases they fail to take art classes.&quot; Luo Xiaohong felt heartbroken. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is another mystery in scheduling classes. According to the normal schedule, for example, a Chinese teacher has twelve classes and uses the original Chinese class hours; but in actual operation, a Chinese teacher is given six Chinese classes. The remaining six periods were replaced by art, physical education and other courses, and naturally all &quot;minor subjects&quot; were taken into Chinese language classes. According to Luo Xiaohong&#39;s observations in two counties in Zhejiang, the situation of &quot;two class schedules&quot; has been intensifying in the past two years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A private primary school art teacher comes from a county in Dali, Yunnan, and teaches a village primary school with 250 students. She told Southern Weekend reporters that when she came to Guinan School, she seemed to find a companion all of a sudden. For example, both choose two classes to form one big class. Her school does not take up art time, but in the public elementary school next door, the situation is completely different. &quot;Now there are exams and there are not enough class hours. The teacher has no choice but to do this in order to achieve results.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“What I painted twenty years ago, you are still painting”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporters saw at the teaching site that the art teachers who came for training experienced the Guinan experience in the studio The content of aesthetic education in the classroom: understanding materials-obtaining materials-production-teacher comments. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The level of rural teachers obviously varies. The first practical class involved hand-made books, and most of the teachers successfully completed the work. In the second period of the ink painting class, the quality of the teacher&#39;s ink paintings showed a certain difference. While creating, some teachers told Southern Weekend reporters that, in fact, they had not really touched ink for many years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to Guan Yong&#39;s request, an art teacher from Ankang, Shaanxi Province used three different kinds of paper to experience ink. He couldn&#39;t help but think of the students in class. Each student was given a brush, poured a little bit of ink, and asked them to apply it on the cardboard box and A4 paper. This was his best effort to let the students experience ink. If it is a handicraft class, paper cutting may be the simplest and most convenient. Many teachers told Southern Weekend reporters that the current main teaching format is drawing classes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The reality of rural resource constraints still exists. An art teacher in Huaihua, Hunan Province said that the school’s resources are scarce, and some art class materials even need to be purchased out of own pocket, costing almost 20,000 yuan. “It’s really impossible to do it. The classroom is empty, there is nothing, and the drawing board No, how to teach?&quot; Zhang Yaoren said that in the schools he contacted, students need to bring their own materials. If families cannot provide them, it will be difficult for the courses to continue. &quot;The pain of materials is a scar that has nowhere to hide in art courses.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/16/Hj47ESMSaP91n0rp7AvckUqLyRfBjsQmFyoeVrM1.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;720&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/16/Hj47ESMSaP91n0rp7AvckUqLyRfBjsQmFyoeVrM1.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250960&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;A fire hydrant at Guinan School decorated with student works. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern Weekend reporter Zhang Rui/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;We cannot ensure that every student gets an art book to take home.&quot; The above-mentioned teacher from Hengyang told Southern Weekend reporters that where she lives, even art textbooks are not widely available, and they can only use teaching materials in turns.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The above-mentioned rural teacher from Yunnan said that some teaching content involves high-rise buildings Buildings, zebra crossings, etc. Some rural children have never left the village and have only seen them on TV. &quot;Since high-rise buildings are drawn with lines and squares, we will transform the content and consider how to return to the teaching objectives.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/16/aq5KSZquk7pNJuHuzUjJUZccQX7cQXqiurpR8NNH.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;720&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/16/aq5KSZquk7pNJuHuzUjJUZccQX7cQXqiurpR8NNH.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250961&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Guinan School’s art studio decorates the walls with students’ paper-cutting work. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern Weekend reporter Zhang Rui/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In rural schools, having an art classroom may be a luxury. An art teacher from Shaanxi recalled that when he first came to school, the principal said to him that you were the only art teacher in the school, &quot;just take whatever you want.&quot; He felt his shoulders sink, but soon he realized that this might mean staying away from various competitions and honors. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The training program does not reject urban art teachers. Maybe their schools have excellent resources, but they are still confused about teaching methods. A young teacher from Beijing&#39;s Haidian District asked that the textbook content requires innovation, for example, asking students to color in triangles, but teachers are limited in what they can do. Guan Yong asked, why don&#39;t you make the triangle bigger? Why not design a giant triangle and let students color it freely? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This teacher born in the 1990s suddenly understood. He was born in a normal school majoring in art education, and now teaches at a key primary school in Haidian, responsible for courses from fourth to sixth grade. According to him, there are plenty of classes and resources, and there are no problems with rural teachers taking on concurrent jobs. The school’s art teachers have all received very good professional art training. &quot;The pressure on art teachers comes from the normalization of &#39;listening to and evaluating lessons&#39;.&quot; The above-mentioned young teacher said that another problem is that the two classes a week are often separated by several days, and the content of the teaching materials is trivial, and students&#39; learning is not systematic enough. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After reading the work, he commented that &quot;the children here (compared to the children in Beijing) are more active.&quot; Unlike many rural teachers who are surprised when they first see the campus, what he feels is not the art itself, but things other than art. At the scene, a teacher asked whether demonstrations should be conducted for children. This has been one of the teaching models for many years. Guan Yong stopped her. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;An art teacher in Chengzhong Village, Tianhe District, Guangzhou told Southern Weekend reporters that he is an art major and has always painted according to standards and learned painting formulas. When painting, the most important thing to consider is the formula. rather than expressing emotion. She pointed to the students&#39; works on the wall and said, &quot;The first feeling is that it is very free and unique.&quot; She recalled that her children attended the top ten middle schools in the district and participated in the school&#39;s interest classes. As a result, the content and mode of learning were no different from when she was a child. &quot;What I drew twenty years ago, you are still drawing.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Art is a pinch of salt&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Guinan has no internal evaluation activities and rarely participates in peripheral art competitions. Zhang Yaoren explained that the core of art works is self-expression and inner feelings. How can this be scored? And when you look at the works in those competitions, you can often see traces of teacher intervention. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A few years ago, Zhang Yaoren wanted to design a logo. In the folk studio, he saw a monkey-style print. This print later became the logo. In accordance with the collection standards, Guan Yong specially made a beautiful collection certificate with the author&#39;s name and the title of the work on it. During the flag-raising ceremony, the certificate was awarded to the child and a bonus was given. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/16/I1BvI5zZPXHpe53okfU9YdjzV0MHq6UiQ4mf1FVA.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/16/I1BvI5zZPXHpe53okfU9YdjzV0MHq6UiQ4mf1FVA.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250962&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Guinan School Art Museum, where creative materials and student works are stored. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern Weekend reporter Zhang Rui/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;As ordinary people, if they can be nourished by beauty, I believe their lives will be better. &quot;So it&#39;s different,&quot; Zhang Yaoren said, &quot;He might keep his house clean and try to take good care of his family; she might pick a handful of wild flowers from the field and put them on the table to turn a plain meal into a new one. It has to be slightly different...&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When Guinan School held a rural children&#39;s art biennial, a student at the University of Pennsylvania in the United States researched and established a data model to analyze the impact of art education on migrant children. . After analyzing the effects of the first round, a positive conclusion was drawn. Zhang Yaoren is reluctant to utilitarianize and digitize the results to demonstrate the relationship between art and academic performance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He often said that art is a handful of salt, and life needs a little spice. As for the potential and influence of aesthetic education, Zhang Yaoren does not consider these and does not care. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Art should always be about education, not works. School teachers have students’ work observations, and teachers observe and record students’ behaviors, habits, emotions, etc. in the classroom. For example, in the &quot;Final Summary Art Classroom Observation Diary&quot;, an observation diary written in the second semester of the 2020-2021 school year, each student is recorded in terms of classroom performance, regular habits, and presentation of works. One student did not perform well. A teacher wrote: &quot;In the future classroom, I will try to find a creative method suitable for this kind of children.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At least from the perspective of some outsiders, occupying art classes, increasing learning time, and improving The enrollment rate is the key to changing the fate of migrant children. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Shi Lei, the principal of Guinan School, has been thinking about a question since 2017: Who are the people closest to us? &quot;Chefs, waiters, repairmen, cleaners, etc. In real life, our feelings come from them.&quot; Shi Lei said, &quot;Our students have a probability of becoming them. This is a very real problem.&quot; According to statistics, the school only has 35 % of students will enter high school, while the remaining students will enter technical secondary schools, vocational schools, etc. What if they have different feelings about life? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Shi Lei told Southern Weekend reporters that over more than five years, the school has successively invested millions of yuan to renovate classrooms, build art galleries, buy materials, etc., and reduce the school’s enrollment scale from 2000 to 2008. The number of students has dropped to about 1,200, and tuition fees are low, so the school is losing money almost every year. Some of his colleagues came to the school to criticize him and went to see a doctor if he had a mental problem. &quot;(They don&#39;t understand) Will this help me raise my tuition fees or help me recruit more students?&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is difficult to &quot;copy&quot; Guinan-style art education. Guan Yong contacted some schools in Zhuhai and almost reached the final stage, but gave up due to teacher objections. Guan Yong recalled that the teachers were unwilling to do it because they thought it would increase the workload but bring no additional income. He took the initiative to teach, but the teachers did not agree. &quot;It&#39;s so commonplace,&quot; Guan Yong said, &quot;If you don&#39;t do it, just leave.&quot; Luo Xiaohong told Southern Weekend reporters that they had donated brushes, paints, etc. to some rural schools, but after a few years, the things were still stored there. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;If you understand our students, you will only do more.&quot; Shi Lei said that the children of migrant workers live a busy and unstable life, and lack opportunities to relieve their emotions under the pressure of life. Would life be better if there was one more outlet in a very compact life? After nine years of reading tens of thousands of works, will the aesthetics of life improve? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Shi Lei grew up in a school for the children of a factory. He had contact with many good art teachers and music teachers since he was a child. After a few years, he forgot all his knowledge other than language and mathematics, but he remembered the art classes and music classes in the past, and his life was also different. Thanks to the abundant gifts at that time. &quot;Others see that we have done a lot of works and painted a lot of paintings, but these are the least important in our hearts,&quot; Shi Lei said, &quot;We are not doing this for this thing, what is really important is the process of aesthetic education. ”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 16 Sep 2023 19:25:05 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[癌症晚期旅客登机被拒：航空公司宁担非议背后的考量是什么？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256858]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-16 18:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Recently, a civil aviation news incident has attracted attention. On September 12, 2023, a passenger with terminal cancer booked a Chengdu Airlines ticket at Chengdu Tianfu International Airport but was refused boarding, which attracted public attention. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As can be seen in the video, an old man is sitting in a wheelchair, while another man and the old lady are sitting on the ground and calling airline customer service. The man cried and said, &quot;Nothing is allowed to let me leave. I signed the commitment myself and brought a caregiver with me. Why don&#39;t you let me leave?&quot; Then the man added, &quot;I have cancer. Four months. You said before that if you don&#39;t have heart disease, respiratory disease, or trauma, it&#39;s fine.&quot; The family finally knelt on the ground and begged. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Afterwards, Chengdu Airlines staff responded that the passenger was indeed a terminal cancer patient, and the company has clear regulations not to carry such patients to prevent passengers from becoming unwell during the flight. This regulation is publicized in the &quot;General Conditions of Transport&quot; on the official website. If you are a cancer patient in the early or middle stages, there is no absolute restriction on passengers taking the flight. Netizens&#39; opinions are also polarized. Some netizens said that the airline is impersonal and has &quot;overlord clauses&quot; that &quot;discriminate against passengers.&quot; However, some netizens expressed understanding. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This incident has come to an end, but there are still some issues worthy of analysis. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Firstly, airlines deny boarding to passengers with terminal cancer for safety reasons. Article 6.1.3 of the &quot;General Conditions of Carriage&quot; on the official website of Chengdu Airlines states, &quot;Passengers with the following diseases will not be transported unless special arrangements are made with Chengdu Airlines&#39; consent.&quot; Paragraph 10 of this article refers to &quot;patients with terminal cancer.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, not only Chengdu Airlines is &quot;not allowed to carry&quot;, but all major domestic airlines also have similar or similar regulations. For example, Air China lists in the general conditions of transportation, &quot;Large vertical septum&quot; &quot;Patients with tumors, extremely large hernias and intestinal obstructions&quot; will not be provided with air transportation services unless agreed or with special arrangements; China Eastern Airlines also states in the &quot;Service Instructions for Sick Passengers&quot; that for &quot;patients with large mediastinal tumors, extremely large hernias&quot; and patients with intestinal obstruction&quot;, it is recommended not to choose to fly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It can be seen that Chengdu Airlines is not the only airline that &quot;targets&quot; sick passengers. To be more precise, similar regulations of airlines fall into the category of &quot;rejection of transportation and restriction of transportation&quot;. Although the specific regulations of major airlines are different, the principle behind them is the same: airlines cannot guarantee that they can effectively protect and ensure the safety of passengers during the transportation process. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Revere regulations, revere life&quot; is by no means an empty phrase in the field of civil aviation. Behind every seemingly strange regulation, there are safety accidents, large and small, and bloody lives as a reminder. For passengers with advanced cancer or special diseases, changes in air pressure and oxygen concentration will pose a great threat to life, and there is a potential risk of sudden illness requiring rescue. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, not only passengers with special diseases are not suitable for boarding, but also pregnant women who are 32 weeks or more than 36 weeks pregnant are not suitable for boarding. They require medical permission and diagnosis certificate to board with restrictions. This takes into account the potential health risks of pregnant women during flights. By extension, people suffering from cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases are not suitable for riding roller coasters, and the elderly, weak, sick and young are not suitable for participating in extreme sports such as diving and mountain climbing. This is not a &quot;denial of service&quot; or &quot;discrimination against consumers&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Therefore, the passengers in this incident are more suitable to travel by high-speed rail or car. This can avoid the health risks caused by changes in air pressure and oxygen concentration during flight, and it is easier to get timely information during the trip. medical services. After all, it is much easier to get off the high-speed train or car to see a doctor than to find a doctor while flying. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Secondly, airlines deny boarding to passengers with terminal cancer, which itself reflects the relationship of equal rights and responsibilities between airlines and passengers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this incident, the &quot;letter of commitment&quot; proposed by the parties concerned attracted more attention. Some netizens believed that since the passengers had &quot;signed and promised to bear all the consequences themselves,&quot; it would be inappropriate for the airline to still refuse to board the plane. Although this statement seems reasonable, it ignores the current laws and the actual situation of civil aviation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In terms of civil relations, airlines are just commercial institutions that provide transportation services. Their contractual obligation is to safely transport passengers to their destinations by aircraft; passengers purchase transportation services that meet the face value and do not Healthcare that goes beyond face value. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If passengers with terminal cancer are allowed to board the plane, the airline may not be able to bear the corresponding risks, and the potential costs required will be far greater than the revenue from this single ticket business, including but not limited to passenger accidents Death, flight turning back after a passenger becomes ill, etc. I would like to ask, once the plane is forced to make a temporary diversion or turn back, who will compensate other passengers for the resulting loss of rights and interests? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Civil aviation aircraft are not special-purpose &quot;medical aircraft&quot; and do not have the conditions for &quot;airborne ICU&quot;. Once a sick passenger encounters an emergency and requires medical treatment during the flight, it may be an additional task that the airline is unable to handle and has no obligation to handle. Whether a passenger dies or the plane is forced to turn back in an emergency, the total losses suffered by all parties will undoubtedly be much greater. A &quot;letter of commitment to bear the consequences&quot; that may not be legally binding cannot persuade airlines to ignore possible risks and bear huge potential costs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Therefore, the airline&#39;s refusal to board passengers with terminal cancer is not so much &quot;discrimination&quot; with a more positive or negative meaning, but rather &quot;differential treatment&quot; based on specific circumstances. This &quot;differential treatment&quot; not only shows respect for the safety of passengers&#39; lives and property, but also demonstrates the principle of &quot;equivalence of rights and responsibilities&quot;. Airlines and passengers are both civil subjects, and their rights and obligations are completely equal. Airlines have the right to refuse service to passengers who exceed their obligations and capabilities. Passengers can also choose other air service providers who are willing to take greater risks, or other means of transportation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 16 Sep 2023 18:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[一块钱酸梅汤打败“入秋第一杯奶茶”，网红中药能刷医保吗？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256723]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-16 17:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 16 Sep 2023 17:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[旧房换新房，能否激活淄博楼市？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256841]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-16 16:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/ image/23/09/15/97064ca1ac.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;2048&quot; height=&quot;1366&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/ 15/97064ca1ac.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250933&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;April 10, 2023, Qisheng Lake Park, Zibo, Shandong . (Visual China/Picture)&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;These days, some staff from local government departments always call Li Bin to ask him about the &quot;trade-in&quot; method of buying a house in Zibo. mode and specific operating procedures. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On September 6, 2023, the Zibo Real Estate Development Association and the Municipal Real Estate Brokerage and Appraisal Association jointly launched a signing ceremony for the &quot;old-for-new&quot; home purchase, with the first batch of 12 companies Representatives of real estate development companies and real estate brokerage agencies signed cooperation agreements. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;According to &quot;Zibo Daily&quot;, &quot;old for new&quot; means exchanging old houses for new ones. Real estate development companies and real estate brokerage agencies join forces to speed up the sales of existing housing. Real estate companies give priority to providing high-quality housing to meet the replacement needs of home buyers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;However, there is still a lot of speculation in the market about the specific method of &quot;trade-in&quot;. On the short video platform, some people interpreted that Zibo’s “old-for-new” policy for home purchases this time allows the appraisal agency to “give the money after the old house has been appraised to the home buyer, and the home buyer will then use the money to buy a new home.”&lt;/p >; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Trading old for new&quot; was the earliest housing sales model tried by Beike. On September 13, as the deputy general manager of Shell (Shandong) Internet Co., Ltd., Li Bin clarified to Southern Weekend reporters: When the original customer replaced, if the second-hand house he lived in before could not be sold, he would not have the funds on hand to buy a new house. Deposit. The current &quot;old-for-new&quot; model requires developers, intermediaries and customers to sign an agreement. According to the agreement, after the customer pays the deposit, the developer will give the customer 90-180 days to sell the house and reserve the customer&#39;s favorite house; The intermediary also promotes clients’ second-hand houses on the platform. If the customer&#39;s house is still not sold after the agreement period, the deposit will be refunded. &quot;The core of &#39;trade-in&#39; old for new&#39; is to shorten the replacement cycle between new and second-hand houses.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image /23/09/15/56104f158b.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;2048&quot; height=&quot;1434&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/15 /56104f158b.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250934&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Local Government Concerned about the decommissioning of new houses&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In Shandong, Jinan City was the first to launch the &quot;old-for-new&quot; policy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In July 2023, the Shandong Real Estate Association and the Jinan Real Estate Association held a seminar on the &quot;Real Estate Market Situation in the First Half of the Year&quot;. In addition to the member units of the Shandong Real Estate Association and the Jinan Real Estate Association, the meeting was also attended by the Shandong Provincial Department of Housing and Urban-Rural Development, the Finance and Economics Office of the Provincial Party Committee, the Jinan Municipal Housing and Urban-Rural Development Bureau and some financial institutions. Li Bin remembers that that meeting was the starting point for the debut of &quot;old for new&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;It was recognized by some developers in Jinan at that time.&quot; Li Bin said that in late August, &quot;old for new&quot; began to be piloted in some projects in Jinan. Taking a project of a real estate company as an example, Beike provides home buyers with second-hand house evaluation, listing, inspection and transaction services. For second-hand houses that meet transaction standards, Beike will help customers sell their houses quickly within 30-90 days; the project team Provide 1%-2% home purchase subsidies to buyers of second-hand houses to speed up the sales of second-hand houses. Among them, buyers of first-hand houses can lock in the house they want by paying 100,000 yuan, and then pay for the new house after the second-hand house is sold. If the second-hand house is not sold, they can enjoy check-out guarantee. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Li Bin remembered that at a real estate brokerage seminar held in Zibo in August, staff from the relevant administrative departments in Zibo also expressed their opinions on this &quot;old-for-new&quot; housing buying and selling model. I was very interested and suggested that Zibo&#39;s industry associations could also try to promote it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;The core method is to shorten the transaction time between new homes and second homes, and the government plays a supporting and encouraging role in this.&quot; Li Bin introduced. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Zhuge housing search data shows that from January to July 2023, the price of new houses in Zibo continued to climb, rising from 8,272 yuan/square meter to 8,425 yuan/square meter. But the price dropped to 8,389 yuan/square meter in August. In contrast, Zibo&#39;s second-hand housing prices have been rising month after month, and since November 2022, there has been an inversion of primary and second-hand housing prices. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Li Bin explained to Southern Weekend reporters that &quot;replacing old houses with new ones&quot; requires accelerating the disposal of second-hand houses and at the same time making a good connection with the replacement of new houses. If the second-hand house in the hands of the home buyer cannot be sold, he will not have the down payment for the new house, and he will not be able to make the decision to buy a new house. &quot;Data shows that the average transaction cycle for second-hand houses in Jinan City is now 175 days, and even more than 250 days in Zibo.&quot; In smaller cities and counties, the transaction cycle for second-hand houses will be longer. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Li Bin introduced that the &quot;old-for-new&quot; policy for buying houses will be implemented in many cities in Shandong such as Tai&#39;an and Jining. In addition to Shandong, some cities outside the province also want to learn about relevant experiences. Li Bin found that the local governments who came to communicate would be more concerned about the sale of new houses. “After all, the sale of new houses is the most important means for cities to activate the real estate market.” &lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;There are more people waiting and watching&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;September 8, &quot;Zibo Daily&quot; More than 40 first-hand properties with &quot;old-for-new&quot; agreements were announced. However, several local real estate agents in Zibo told Southern Weekend reporters that more people who want to buy a house are still waiting and watching. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Zhang Yuan (pseudonym), a real estate agent in Zibo City, told Southern Weekend reporters that after the introduction of the &quot;old for new&quot; policy, the number of people viewing houses has increased significantly, more than before. One-third, his daily working hours also increased from the original 12 hours to 14 hours. He said that if the agent fails to sell the old house within the three months stipulated in the agreement, the client will take back the old house and the deposit, which is &quot;equivalent to three months of work in vain.&quot; Zhang Yuan explained that the policy will bring greater workload to the intermediary, but if the client is sure to sell the old house, he will have more confidence to buy a new house. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Another Zibo real estate agent, Sun Yu (pseudonym), updated his policy interpretation on the short video platform on September 8. In addition, he receives twenty or thirty related consultation calls every day. There are people who are in a hurry to sell their old house and buy a new one and ask more than a dozen questions at once, while there are also people who inquire casually and take a wait-and-see attitude. Sun Yu told Southern Weekend reporters that developers of large real estate projects generally do not accept old houses. “If he (the developer) wants to sell new houses, why would he buy second-hand houses?” As for intermediaries, they are generally willing to represent large-property houses. , that is, houses where the owner owns the house and can produce a real estate certificate, &quot;the sales difficulty is low and the transaction rate is higher.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Sun Yu said that the second-hand houses for sale in his hands are mainly located in Zhangdian West District, the main urban area of ​​Zibo, which is also what the intermediary calls Zibo&#39;s &quot;prime location.&quot; The highest price here exceeds 20,000 yuan per square meter, while in the suburbs with the lowest prices, one square meter sells for only 5,000 to 6,000 yuan, which is a quarter of the price in the central city. &quot;The first-hand properties participating in the &#39;trade-in&#39; program are not very easy to sell,&quot; Sun Yu said. Most of them are located in the suburbs of Zibo with relatively poor locations, and the number of houses in the school district is relatively small. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;But there are already customers who have successfully &quot;traded in old products for new ones&quot; with Sun Yu. This is a 35-year-old customer. He needs to sell his old house in the eastern part of Zhangdian District before he can have enough budget to buy a house in a school district. Previously, this old house had been listed on the trading platform for nearly half a year without any interest. In the past few days, Sun Yu sold the client&#39;s old house for 800,000 yuan, and the client spent more than 1.5 million yuan to buy a school district house in the southwest area of ​​Zhangdian. In Sun Yu&#39;s opinion, this is one of the best-located houses in the first-hand real estate that participates in the &quot;old-for-new&quot; project. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Sun Yu currently opens his own real estate agency in Zibo, with more than a dozen employees, and his business focuses on the sale of first-hand and second-hand houses. He said that the current policy has not brought significant changes in sales volume to the company. In 2023, the company&#39;s monthly housing sales will mainly be concentrated in 3 to 5 units. The New Deal has led to more people consulting, &quot;but everyone is very cautious, and there are more people waiting and watching.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 16 Sep 2023 16:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[当“知心闺蜜”恶语相向之前：李佳琦这样的“赛博货郎”何以逆势成功？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256854]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-16 15:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Recently, &quot;the most powerful beauty blogger&quot; Li Jiaqi angrily criticized consumers in the live broadcast room, which caused Li Jiaqi himself has been caught in the whirlpool of public opinion. Even after he apologized in tears, the criticism and accusations against him have not subsided. In addition to pushing him to the forefront of public opinion, this storm has also focused the public&#39;s attention on In the industry of &quot;carrying anchor&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before getting involved in this verbal controversy, Li Jiaqi had built an astonishing business empire through years of hard work in the field of beauty live streaming. The total sales of his short video platform live broadcast room in one month exceeded &quot;Shocking records&quot; such as 1 billion yuan and 15,000 lipsticks sold in 5 minutes have even triggered communication scholars to study its sales discourse system and communication strategies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Judging from the main consumer portraits, Li Jiaqi mainly targets female audiences, which can be seen from his iconic opening remarks &quot;all girls&quot; during his live broadcast. In addition to the skilled symbolic use of &quot;girlfriend accents&quot; such as &quot;Your devil is here&quot;, &quot;Oh my god&quot;, &quot;It&#39;s so pretty&quot;, &quot;Buy it, buy it&quot;, Li Jiaqi is also very good at using hierarchical contrast communication strategies. Through &quot;lifting and stepping on&quot;, we create a &quot;superior&quot; consumption satisfaction for consumers. For example, when describing the lipstick brand as &quot;rustic&quot;, Li Jiaqi would use rhetorical methods such as &quot;the color my mother painted twenty years ago&quot; to awaken consumers&#39; memories. When recommending their own products, they will use rhetorical means such as &quot;You are the peach in the world&quot;, &quot;You will be a lady if you paint it&quot;, &quot;Limited edition of XX color&quot;, etc. to provide female consumers with room for imagination and inspire them. Consumer impulse to place a single trial. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Consumers, mainly female, are willing to spend money in Li Jiaqi’s live broadcast room not only because of their recognition and affirmation of the professional ability of his “lipstick brother”, but also because of his “close friend” trust and favor. Similarly, what female consumers buy in Li Jiaqi’s live broadcast room is not only lipstick and eyebrow pencil, but also emotional value. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So the cause and result of the &quot;censorship incident&quot; are actually very simple. For anchors, under the pressure of the stock game and the economic downturn, even Li Jiaqi, who is precise and proficient in the &quot;girlfriend accent&quot; and &quot;the best understanding of women&#39;s hearts&quot;, has perfect head anchors to mobilize consumers&#39; consumption impulses. Times are not as easy as before, and the resulting fatigue and irritability are themselves a natural reflection of the economic and social environment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For consumers, it is emotionally difficult for consumers to have their “best friends” who have flattered and flattered them in the past and provided full emotional value regardless of whether they consume or not, suddenly lower their faces and say nasty things to them. Accepted. Although Li Jiaqi often calls and describes consumers as &quot;princess&quot;, &quot;lady&quot; and &quot;queen&quot;, in fact, his main consumer groups are still mainly working-class people. They are commonly known as &quot;workers&quot; and are involved in workplace pressure. When I was exhausted and tried to find emotional value in the live broadcast room of my &quot;best friend&quot;, I was accused of &quot;not trying hard&quot; by the other party. It is also a normal emotional reaction to get angry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It can be said that the &quot;censorship incident&quot; was actually an instant hedging of the common emotions between Li Jiaqi and consumers under pressure. But Li Jiaqi and consumers are not the only ones under pressure. At a time when &quot;it&#39;s not easy for everyone to make money,&quot; the way for &quot;Li Jiaqi&quot; to make money seems too easy, so the &quot;censorship incident&quot; has become an outlet for that pressure. While the public used this incident to vent their stress and emotions, they also began to think about how &quot;goods anchors&quot; have become an &quot;easy to make money&quot; industry in our society. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, Li Jiaqi’s role in the entire beauty industry chain is more similar to that of a salesman selling needles, thread, and cosmetics boxes in pre-modern society. He is neither a producer of goods nor a businessman who opens a store to do business in the traditional sense, but a more special kind of sales terminal. In the old society, due to the restrictions of etiquette, women could neither move around nor obtain information about goods. These housewives, who had limited information and limited knowledge, needed the medium of a salesman to understand and purchase goods. Therefore, in ancient society, a successful salesman must be a person who is familiar with women&#39;s psychological characteristics, masters certain speaking skills, and can speak into women&#39;s hearts. A ballad in the old society sang like this:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Salesman Son, selling flower thread, carrying a load on the street. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Jingle bell shakes to call the girl, and leads her to meet her at the door. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The girl should smile and be angry again, and the price should be cheap and the goods should be new. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fortunately, the salesman is blessed with beauty and often has sex with beauties in his life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It can be seen that modern &quot;beauty anchors&quot; are in the same vein as the ancient salesmen selling needle threads and cosmetics boxes in terms of understanding the psychological characteristics of consumers, formulating targeted marketing strategies, and matching the emotional value of sales. It is precisely because of this characteristic that there was widespread prejudice and discrimination against the profession of peddlers in the old society. It was believed that they behaved improperly and would seduce women whenever they had the opportunity. In Ming and Qing dynasty novels, there were many peddlers who seduced, abducted and trafficked women. The story of a good woman. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From the perspective of business development form theory, peddlers in the old society were the product of poor business information in a closed and semi-closed &quot;acquaintance society&quot; environment. In the information age, there are various sales channels and sales methods, open product information is readily available, and various product advertisements are overwhelming. In this environment, there should be no living space for &quot;cyber peddlers&quot;, at least other It should not occupy such an important position and proportion in modern business activities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But reality is exactly the opposite of theory. The &quot;cyber gangsters&quot; represented by Li Jiaqi have not only bucked the trend and achieved great success in the modern information society, but also work part-time with &quot;Internet celebrities&quot; in some other countries. The business model of carrying goods is different. In my country, &quot;cyber hawkers&quot; have developed into a specialized profession and formed a large professional group, becoming the most important and powerful sales channel and method of online e-commerce. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the world&#39;s largest manufacturing country, the world&#39;s largest informatization country, and the world&#39;s largest online retail country, consumers&#39; consumption habits have returned to a certain extent to the &quot;hawker model&quot; of pre-modern society. , there are actually very profound reasons behind this counter-intuitive, counter-logical, and counter-intuitive reality. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First of all, it is precisely because of the huge abundance of products, the explosive growth of product information, and the seamless coverage of product advertisements that consumers in the ocean of products and information feel confused and confused. . At the same time, the cost of &quot;trial and error&quot; has also increased exponentially, and consumers who are unwilling to delve into relevant knowledge and compare the pros and cons of similar products in order to buy a product will naturally return to &quot;acquaintances&quot; in another sense. Society&quot;, that is, choosing to trust the &quot;enthusiastic recommendations&quot; of the &quot;cyber peddlers&quot; you like. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Secondly, the information society certainly has its noisy and bustling side, but behind the information explosion, surging public opinion, and all-weather socialization, the spiritual loneliness of atomized individuals on the Internet is also a serious problem. As mentioned earlier, what Li Jiaqi, the &quot;cyber salesman&quot; provides, is not just lipstick and eyebrow pencil, but also emotional value. Perhaps, the latter is more important than the former in determining the role of the ancient profession of &quot;salesman&quot; in this modern information age. A broad and permanent living space in the commercial society. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 16 Sep 2023 15:25:03 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[林家栋：要把角色的灵魂、内心抓出来]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256835]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-16 14:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/13/OugasTfNJ5ML9yNbtsKg8Ese6jTVvmFQwr4ZgUOK.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/OugasTfNJ5ML9yNbtsKg8Ese6jTVvmFQ wr4ZgUOK. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250583&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>; (Visual China/Picture) &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2019, police officer Wang Shouyue retired in Guangdong. His colleagues celebrated him. At the dinner, he thought of the unsolved cases and the uncaught people, and he felt depressed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Shouyue read the news about a fire somewhere in Yunnan on his mobile phone. There was a very familiar face among the passersby. He was sure that it was Chen Xinwen, the main suspect who robbed a cash transport truck and killed his police colleague more than 20 years ago. . Wearing casual clothes, he embarked on the journey alone, carrying a bag of fruit to visit Chen Xinwen, who had been living incognito for many years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/jRRYqkC3rNmbY3a1KtAAEoIW1ZbU1J7s6unHPf1l.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;540&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/jRRYqkC3rNmbY3a1KtAAEoIW1ZbU1J7s6unHPf1l.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250584&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&quot;The Eighth Suspect&quot; (2023)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the movie &quot;The Eighth Suspect&quot; released on September 9, 2023, Hong Kong actor Lin Jiadong Plays the role of retired policeman Wang Shouyue. There is only one gunfight scene in the film, and there is no suspense element. The audience already knows who the person who has not been arrested is. The highlight is the details of the confrontation between Wang Shouyue and Chen Xinwen. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This film will be shortlisted for the main competition unit of the Shanghai International Film Festival in June 2023. When interviewed, rival actors Dapeng (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;plays Chen Xinwen&lt;/span>;) and Sun Yang mentioned that they are used to rehearsing before filming, while Jiadong and Lin The other actors kept their distance and &quot;just come up and give it&quot; to protect the immediacy of their reactions. Lin Jiadong is very relaxed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What they were talking about was an office drama. Wang Shouyue could not bear the noise of construction at the construction site and went to the construction company to report the situation. Chen Xinwen and several others were studying the drawings. Wang Shouyue thought they were studying real estate development, but in fact they were plotting to rob. That was a few days before the shocking case occurred more than 20 years ago. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I don&#39;t know what you will do next, and you don&#39;t know what I will do next, so outside of the camera, we keep a sense of distance.&quot; Lin Jiadong said. He felt this was the best way to communicate that suited the needs of the character. Cheung Song-man, who plays a police colleague, likes to be flexible on the set, and Lam Ji-tung happily accepted the role. &quot;If you suddenly change anything, I can change it. Because my role is still in my hands, and your role is still in your hands.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lin Jiadong has been a film actor for 22 years. In 2002, he played a policeman in a movie for the first time, as Big B in &quot;Infernal Affairs&quot;. On the rooftop, after the duel scene between Chen Yongren and Liu Jianming pointed guns at each other and revealed their trump cards, the audience thought the outcome was decided. Unexpectedly, in the elevator, Big B appeared and simply killed the real policeman Chen Yongren, revealing his identity as an undercover gangster. The identity caught Liu Jianming, a fake policeman who was also an undercover and wanted to start a new life, off guard. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is the last scene of the whole film. Before this, Lin Jiadong had never seen the complete script, and he really thought that Big B was a good policeman - the director intended it. Suddenly learning that his identity was reversed, Lin Jiadong panicked, fearing that he would make a mistake. At that time, he was still ignorant and needed to listen to the arrangements of his seniors. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In an early episode of &quot;A Date with Lu Yu&quot;, Andy Lau, who played Liu Jianming and was Lin Jiadong&#39;s boss, mentioned that he wanted Lin Jiadong to lose the &quot;aura of a TV series&quot; at that time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/Xwtcx2vxeG6phdNkczSzs9mfN7KAhSHKekv8icwR.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/Xwtcx2vxeG6phdNkczSzs9mfN7KAhSHKekv8icwR.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250586&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&quot;Slaying the Wolf: Greedy Wolf&quot; (2017)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lin Jiadong entered the TVB artist training class in 1987. The first time he filmed was the Spring Festival, which was originally scheduled The actors went on strike, so he had a chance to take over. In the 1990s, he became a relatively successful actor in TV dramas. The high-intensity shooting schedule made him feel brain-blocked and &quot;he wanted to be perfect, but he couldn&#39;t do it.&quot; He wanted to change his life, switched to the film industry, and signed a contract with Andy Lau&#39;s company. &quot;Even if it is an idle role or an inconspicuous little role, when the camera comes to you, you will be the protagonist for the second. Don&#39;t waste this opportunity, play this role well.&quot; He once said in an interview. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Director Johnnie To&#39;s &quot;Underworld&quot; (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 毷体, 毷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;2005&lt;/span>;) has many acting talents, including Simon Yam, Tony Leung Ka-fai, Lam Suet, Nick Cheung did not cover up Lin Jiadong&#39;s shining point. In a year of handover between gangs and winning streaks, the younger generation competes for power. Dongguan Zai, played by Lam Jiadong, is loyal to one of the factions. He is obedient, ruthless, and his ambitions gradually expand. Fans began to recognize him. Soon, the role of the traitor Li Zhao in &quot;Ip Man&quot; (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;2008&lt;/span>;) won Lam Jiadong the Hong Kong Film Award (&lt; span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;&quot;Hereinafter referred to as the Academy Awards&quot;&lt;/span>;) Nominated for Best Supporting Actor. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/sepyjFDz5nBfX5DhRUB7nlA43arTY2X1K4i8E3fg.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height= &quot;533&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/sepyjFDz5nBfX5DhRUB7nlA43arTY2X1K4i8E3fg.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250589&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&quot;Ip Man&quot; (2008)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hong Kong is rich in police and gangster movies. Lam Jiadong has played both police and gangsters. Some of the policemen he plays are polite and capable, while others are sophisticated. &quot;I have been a policeman many times, and every time I am looking for differences. Because I believe that a person who has lived for so many years must have different mental states, thoughts, and personalities. . I have this opportunity to put different possibilities.&quot; Lin Jiadong said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/bgR83OjJYp2oQWymrd1m26vKCXFEnubavG0JtX1D.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/bgR83OjJYp2oQWymrd1m26vKCXFEnubavG0JtX1D.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250585&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&quot;Cold War&quot; (2012)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2013, he won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his role as Albert, a senior police officer in &quot;Cold War&quot; Nominated. In the film, the hawks and the civil servants are at odds with each other, the rivalry between Tony Leung Ka Fai and Aaron Kwok is brilliant, and the new police officer played by Eddie Peng is a lurking villain who wants to help his father (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: italics, italics_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Tony Leung Ka Fai&#39;s role&lt;/span>;) clears the obstacles to promotion and has a big turn; in comparison, Albert&#39;s image is by no means the fullest and most brilliant, but Lin Jiadong holds his own. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lin Jiadong has also played a kind-faced but cold-blooded gangster. With the indifferent King of Thieves, he also won the Hong Kong Film Awards, the Hong Kong Film Critics Society, and the Hong Kong Film Directors Association Best Actor. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/npjwyFz4FWkI6toJ9VmpUmau97eTgt5bT0KVEMQh.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;660&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/npjwyFz4FWkI6toJ9VmpUmau97eTgt5bT0KVEMQh.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250588&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&quot;Wisdom Teeth&quot; (2021)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2022, he won two Academy Awards for Best Actor for the two films &quot;Hand-Rolled Cigarettes&quot; and &quot;Wisdom Teeth&quot; Protagonist nomination. Among them, &quot;Hand-Rolled Cigarettes&quot; he starred in for zero pay, playing a person abandoned by society: his character Guan Chao was a Chinese-American British soldier more than 20 years ago. After retirement, his life was frustrated, he owed loan sharks, and made a living as a gangster. A hunted Indian in trouble ends up in danger himself. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lin Jiadong is 56 years old this year. His screen image in recent years, from Guan Chao to Wang Shouyue, has a gloomy and aging look. But he himself is well maintained and has a slim figure. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One night in early September, at around 9 o&#39;clock, after a busy day&#39;s work, Lin Jiadong&#39;s interest was still high when he talked about performances, such as &quot;Homicide&quot; (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: italics, italics_ GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;2023&lt;/span>;) His free play in the rooftop scene at the end of the film allowed him to play the numerology master who muttered to himself after the split personality: &quot;I am a flower, I am a flower.&quot; For example, The subtle change in Guan Chao&#39;s attitude toward Indians in &quot;Hand-Rolled Cigarettes&quot; is due to the change of the other person&#39;s name. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He has an excellent memory and can quickly recall the last scene of &quot;Underworld&quot; and how the ambitious Dongguan boy handled the lines breathlessly. From time to time, he added body movements to restore the image of himself locked in a room and thinking hard: he would collapse on the sofa, sit up again for half an hour, and act as if he were reading a script, looking for a breakthrough. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Shouyue is a boring person. After finally retiring, his life still feels like work. This may be a bit like Lin Jiadong. He has appeared on TVB or other TV talk shows many times and said that he is boring and boring. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He is a hard-working actor. Even if he won the Best Actor Award, he said he could only &quot;have fun for 48 hours&quot; and then he would want to work. That year, holding the trophy, he said to himself on the stage, calm down. Then he said, &quot;Over the years, I have felt that acting does not matter age. It does not matter about appearance, the most important thing is your own heart.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The following is Lin Jiadong&#39;s narration:&lt;/p>; &lt; h4>;Police feelings&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;I think Wang Shouyue&#39;s character is a bit different.

If I listen more, I will understand that their life circle, thinking, and common attitude are like this. Their lives satisfy me.

This involves the issue of human nature. People must protect themselves. But if the general has 10 fewer soldiers, how can he fight?

Two weeks later, the director really changed it and made my character die in the end, which made me happy. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;When I was young, I rarely spoke. My elder sister was the only one who talked at home, and my elder sister didn’t understand. We rarely communicate about boys’ ideas. But I read a lot of things every day, and I’m thinking in my head, why is this like this? Wear a black suit to a wedding banquet. My friend, when I go to a funeral parlor, I wear a black suit, so how do I tell whether it’s a red event or a white event? Lots of whys. Later, when we took a training class, the teacher also told us that life is an experience, and you must remember this feeling. Just think more carefully, watch more, think more, find a root for the character&#39;s personality, and your future creations will be more reasonable. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;My friend and I were very bored. We were hungry after 1 o&#39;clock at night, so we asked where we could eat supper. OK? Tea restaurants are the best, offering both Chinese and Western food and drinks. Takeout, no need. Go in and sit down, eat what you want, and see if you are fat (at this time). If I&#39;m not fat, I like to eat ketchup powder the most. If I&#39;m fat, I can&#39;t drink milk tea or coffee. My friend and I ordered a set meal. I’ll give you the food, and I can just drink this, so there’s no waste. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;The tea restaurant is a very real place without so many shackles. In the hotel, everyone is very quiet, saying something they don’t know (simulating whispers), and no emotion can be seen. There is a very real life in the tea restaurant, people are very willing to express their emotions, and you can learn a little gossip. This is the most comfortable look. I&#39;m going now too. It is not difficult to be a mountain person and close yourself off; but life is very important and it is important to experience life, otherwise how can we perform? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/gyGjrnRLSWDVdFArYwioQoc7oOLyCVEKigrDKXXL.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 960&quot; height=&quot;543&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/gyGjrnRLSWDVdFArYwioQoc7oOLyCVEKigrDKXXL.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250587&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&quot;Infernal Affairs&quot; (2002)&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Unwilling&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;When I came to TVB in the 1980s, I didn’t even know what acting was, so I took that training class. I gradually got to know and like it, but I was not content with just acting, because I think some of the acting is acting, which is very technical. , but not good enough and not committed. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;I was shocked before the performance of &quot;Infernal Affairs&quot; (the last scene). Andy Lau, Liu Weiqiang, you lied to me, why should I shoot Chen Yongren? OK, give me a minute. They must know the script very well. I only know a little bit about the character and I don&#39;t know anything else, so I have to trust them. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;But I must admit that after editing, I can accept the finished film. What is the most popular thing? Mask, when facing different scenes and different characters, people will wear different masks. This is what I learned from that scene. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(As for the qualitative change in performance) I think it should be from &quot;Underworld&quot; to &quot;Ip Man&quot; . The audience has seen me as a gentle boy before. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/aTINtflx8n06v4KPhj2AsJnuIePMQJ1XPKlWVwhq.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 960&quot; height=&quot;540&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/aTINtflx8n06v4KPhj2AsJnuIePMQJ1XPKlWVwhq.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250582&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&quot;Underworld&quot; (2005)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;&quot;Underworld&quot; 》The director is Johnnie To, I don’t know what the director is thinking. When I arrived at the scene, I just got the script 30 minutes ago and knew the dialogue, so I gave it a try. Just go with your feelings. The director said OK, and I asked if I could do another one. The director said, I think it’s OK. Really? I feel like I owe a little bit. Director Du said I don&#39;t need it, don&#39;t you believe me? I believe it. (Laughs)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;We can&#39;t watch the playback either, only the director can. There were only one or two group scenes, and other times there was no opponent, just me acting alone. So I don&#39;t really have much idea. Watching it in the cinema, I thought, can a performance be like this? It turns out that the creative changes are so big. The screenwriter and director know us actors very well and can change us to an extent that gives the audience a very new but very real feeling. I think it is very powerful and has a profound impact on me. Then I should still have a chance. I am not willing to be like this. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;It was my first time to go to &quot;Ip Man&quot;. The shooting of the film had not started yet. I went to Shanghai, I hid in my room for the first three days and nights. I didn&#39;t leave the room to eat. My assistant brought the food and put it at the door. It was like living in a prison. The film was shot in three days. I thought about how to deal with this character. With this little space, I could express the helplessness of Li Zhao. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Li Zhao is a traitor, and it is not good to be a traitor, but I told the director that I ( Referring to Li Zhao) I am not in Beijing or Nanjing, so I cannot see the issue of power. I am in Foshan, and I really don’t have much money, so I have to survive. In one scene, the opposite character died. I never thought that people would die for a bag of rice. It didn’t matter if they were beaten or injured. There was nothing you could do about it in those days, but death seemed a little too much. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;During filming, because the director did not call cut, I gave a long reaction. I asked the director to make it longer, even if it was cut later. At that time, I began to know that I had to capture the soul and heart of the character. Fortunately, director Sammo Hung said it could be done. Thanks. &quot;Ip Man&quot; gave me the opportunity, the camera, and the time to do it. Let me tell the audience again through this lens, Li Zhao, are you sad? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Think about it first&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;After filming a scene, I will let myself becomes blank. I take a computer with me when I go to other places. I can stay in my room for a whole day without going out, watching and thinking, because I have entered another character and I don’t think about the past anymore. It’s easy to get stuck if you keep thinking about the past. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;I don&#39;t regard it as a job, it is my interest. Sometimes the director calls and asks: Are you in the company? &quot;Here.&quot; &quot;How are you lately? I thought of a case, what do you think?&quot; &quot;It&#39;s interesting.&quot; &quot;Then I&#39;ll bring the screenwriter over to talk to you in two days.&quot; &quot;Okay.&quot; That&#39;s it. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;For example, recently, there was an investor who was not looking for me to perform. He said that now Hong Kong Movies are really difficult, and he hopes to make a limited-edition film with content. Let me think about it, it could be this or that. He said, &quot;Can you be my producer? Come and talk to the director.&quot; Then the investor asked me to perform. I thought it would be fun, so I collaborated with him. The project is still in the creation stage. Everyone feels that Hong Kong movies may have fewer and fewer themes. I hope that through my own efforts, I can get more space for the audience to watch different themes. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/RG5lr3MtdiJIj0PKTqAtcYOrTRRINVk7VRLWrHsk.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/RG5lr3MtdiJIj0PKTqAtcYOrTRRINVk7VRLWrHsk.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250581&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&quot;Hand-rolled Cigarettes&quot; (2020)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;《 The film &quot;Hand-Rolling Cigarettes&quot; is supported by the Hong Kong government (Author&#39;s note: &quot;Hand-Rolling Cigarettes&quot; is the winning entry in the fourth tertiary college category of Hong Kong&#39;s &quot;First Feature Film Project&quot; and was filmed with funding from the Hong Kong Film Development Council) and is spent on Hong Kong tax dollars People’s money, I said I don’t want the salary, but I have to work on the script. I talked to the Film Development Bureau: I think this subject has potential, but I think it can be better. Can you give me three more months? The other party said yes, you can just perform. I kept chatting with the director and producer. I felt there was room for improvement. Don’t waste it. Think about it first. A week later, we worked on the script again. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;&quot;Hand-rolled Cigarettes&quot; is a whole movie about a few people who have been abandoned by society. Guan Chao He is a British soldier, and his South Asian friend Vinny is a new immigrant who seems not to be accepted by the mainstream. So they have a line of dialogue where Vinny says, this place is different than I imagined. Guan Chao said, you are stupid. Do you think you have gone to heaven? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Most of the plot of &quot;Hand-Rolled Cigarettes&quot; takes place in Guan Chao&#39;s home, a cramped hut. The first time I saw the scenery, the light was very bright. Tsim Sha Tsui is a very prosperous place in Hong Kong. Many signboards are very bright and colorful. I said, director, please believe me. Guan Chao relies on the light from outside to illuminate his life. In fact, his life is not bright at all. It needs to have a dark effect. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;I also told the director that the entire society in the 1990s was very opportunistic and people were greedy. What would you do if you had no identity? make up? make money. At that time, I was filming a TV series at TVB, and the photographer was also filming all the time, watching the rise and fall of the stock market. So there was a guy in the movie who was trading stocks and lost. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;I will tell you with a little bit of life experience, I think this look best matches &quot;Hand-Rolled Cigarettes&quot; this content. The reason why the movie is so full is because I have experienced it. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 16 Sep 2023 14:25:04 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
