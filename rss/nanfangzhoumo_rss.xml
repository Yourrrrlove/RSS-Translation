In the end, they were vulnerable to an ecological crisis and withered at the same time. They were covered in dust by the returning tropical rainforest for thousands of years... …&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I have been fortunate enough to travel to Central America to visit nine Mayan city-state ruins located in three countries. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Except for Mexico and El Salvador, the other Central American countries where the Mayan ruins are located - Guatemala, Honduras and Belize - have not yet established diplomatic relations with our country, and relatively few Chinese have been there, but this area is precisely The hinterland of the Mayan civilization in its heyday. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Copán&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(Copán)&lt;/span>; was my first stop. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/10/11/11VdBB6fTLcQbxkv2y5YxcsGwH1EQwGA1KiJF36q.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1440&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/10/11/11VdBB6fTLcQbxkv2y5YxcsGwH1EQwGA1KiJF36q.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;211197&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The ancient town of Flores, Guatemala, the last religious center of the Mayan civilization. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Wang Zaitian/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Paris of the Mayan World - Copan&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The Copan ruins are located in western Honduras The border is about five kilometers from Guatemala and no more than fifty kilometers from El Salvador. Not far to the west of the ruins is a border town called Copán Ruinas &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(Copán Ruinas)&lt;/span>;, which is Spanish and means &quot;Ruins of Copan&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Copan was the heyday of the Mayan civilization &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>; (250-900 AD, also known as the Classical Period)&lt;/span>; The most important city-state in the southeast. During the Classic Period, the Maya experienced Tikal&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, Script_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(Tikal)&lt;/span>; and Calakmul&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 凯体,楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(Calakmul)&lt;/span>;A long-standing confrontation between two powerful city-states, both located in the Yucatan Peninsula&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 凯体,楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot; >;(Yucatan)&lt;/span>;In the central part, one south and one north, separated by dense jungles, there have been continuous battles. Perhaps in order to expand its territory and resources, Tikal expanded to its rear in the early fifth century and established the city-state of Copan in a river valley in the middle of the Mesoamerican isthmus. The two sides formed a solid alliance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Copan was placed in the twelfth place in the mid-seventh century &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>; (roughly corresponding to the period of Emperor Gaozong of the Tang Dynasty in China) It entered its heyday under King Chan Imix K&#39;awiil (r. 628-695)&lt;/span>;. Yanbao ascended the throne at the age of 15 and reigned for 67 years, the longest among the seventeen kings of Copán. His successor Uaxaclajuun Ub&#39;aah K&#39;awiil (reigned 695-738)&lt;/span>; in that era He is also considered a birthday boy, and he reigned for 43 years &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>; (same as Tang Xuanzong Li Longji)&lt;/span>;. The two kings ruled for a total of 110 years. During this period, Copán was transformed from a river valley city-state into an emerging empire, controlling a number of vassals and opening up trade routes to the Caribbean. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the good times did not last long. Due to the large-scale construction and militarization of the Eighteen Rabbits, Copan, which had limited strength but overexpansion, quickly fell into crisis. In the middle of the eighth century, a rebellion similar to the &quot;Anshi Rebellion&quot; broke out: Batu was attacked by his cronies who had been placed in the small vassal state of Quirigua&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(Quirigua)&lt;/span>;. -family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(K&#39;ak&#39; Tiliw Chan Yopaat)&lt;/span>; Switched sides and rebelled. He was caught off guard and lost the battle. He was captured alive and taken to Quirigua, where he was captured in the main square. Beheading as a sacrifice - modern historians have noticed that two years ago, the monarch of the city-state of Calakmul made a special visit to Rainy Day, thus speculating that Calakmul may have planned and funded the rebellion behind the scenes. , the purpose is to cut off the right-hand man of the feuding Tikal. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the death of Eighteen Rabbits, Copán, which was countered by Quirigua, has since gone downhill, although it once had a close relationship with Palenque, a large city-state in the west&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: italics, italics _GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(Palenque)&lt;/span>;The marriage tried to make a comeback, but the decline of the national destiny was irreversible. At the beginning of the ninth century, the history books of Copán stopped updating, and the river valley city-state suddenly declined and quickly disappeared into the resurgent rainforest vegetation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another thousand years later, the American archaeologist Stephens &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(John Stephens)&lt;/span>; and the British painter In 1839, Frederick Catherwood &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(Frederick Catherwood)&lt;/span>; found the Copan ruins in 1839 based on the legends of the Mayan indigenous people. He made this comment on the ruins in the jungle:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;It is laid out in front of us, like a broken ship in the ocean. The ship, its mast is gone, its crew is gone, no one knows when it came or what destroyed it, everything is a mystery. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/10/11/YHloVyPZjVDhCq4f3GOL25dsDqeRBKHVTnRp4jCW.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1440&quot; height=&quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/10/11/YHloVyPZjVDhCq4f3GOL25dsDqeRBKHVTnRp4jCW.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;211204&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The Grand Plaza of Copan, with the &quot;Stairs of History&quot; covered by a canopy on the right. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Wang Zaitian/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Copan ruins we see today are only a small part of the core area of ​​the city-state of Copan. It is around the large square that served as the political, religious and cultural center of the Mayan city-state. There is a small pyramid in the center of the square. On the north side are eight stone statues more than two meters high, six of which are carved with eighteen rabbits. These stone carvings are reminiscent of the architectural decoration style of South Asian temples: the details are extremely complex and gorgeous, but overall they lack highlights and personality. Perhaps it can be called Mayan Rococo style. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the southeast side of the pyramid is a kickball court. Cuqiu is a unique sports competition of the Mayans and a noble sacrificial activity. Due to the lack of literature, it is not yet fully understood how it is played. It is generally believed to be a bit like today&#39;s volleyball. Players from both sides take turns hitting a solid rubber ball that symbolizes the sun. They are not allowed to touch the ball with their heads, hands and feet. Instead, you can only hit the ball with your elbow, hip or knee, hitting the ball behind the opponent, or causing the opponent to be unable to save the ball and lose points. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Just as the annual Quidditch game at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; novels has a sure-fire setting for capturing the Golden Snitch, the kickball game also has a sure-fire rule. The kickball court is rectangular, with a high wall on each side of the long side. There is a stone ring at the top of the center of the high wall, which is similar to the &quot;basket&quot; in the basketball court, except that the basket is not horizontal, but vertical. , and the position is quite high, it is absolutely impossible for players to take off and dunk; the holes in the ring are also very small, only slightly larger than the diameter of a rubber ball. In the kickball game, if the player successfully passes the ball through the stone ring, he wins and the game ends immediately. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for the outcome of the kickball players, historians are still debating. Some people think that the loser will have his heart disemboweled and sacrificed to the gods. The other side has the opposite opinion and believes that only the winner can obtain this supreme thing. of glory. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Cu stadium we see today is the third-generation stadium in the history of the city-state of Copan. It was built under the edict of the Eighteen Rabbits. Its two predecessors have been buried under its feet. This golf course is also the second largest golf course excavated in the Mayan world so far, second only to the Chichen Itza Stadium in Mexico. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/10/11/GDDRFyXAphjGoYhSo02bo4mBPUVUF4pQ1qsPtl7G.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1280&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/10/11/GDDRFyXAphjGoYhSo02bo4mBPUVUF4pQ1qsPtl7G.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;211198&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The court is played, and the high platform in the background is the royal temple of the King of Copan. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Wang Zaitian/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the southeast side of the Cui Stadium is a spectacular &quot;Historic Staircase&quot;, which consists of 2,500 half-meter square There are 63 stone steps, about 30 meters high and 10 meters wide, with a slope of nearly 60 degrees, very steep. Each stone is engraved with Mayan hieroglyphics - the entire stone step records the history of the city-state of Copan from its establishment until Eighth century history. In order to protect the cultural relics from the sun and rain, a plastic canopy was erected above the &quot;Historic Stairs&quot;, which affected its appearance and internal lighting. Visitors are also unable to climb and can only look up from the bottom. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Directly south of the main square is a hill. The top of the mountain was once a temple. When kickball games and sacrificial ceremonies were held, the royal family of Copan looked down on the people from here. In its heyday, Copan had 27,000 people. Thousands of residents are indeed worthy of the title of “ten thousand peoples”. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The entire Copan ruins are not very big and can be browsed in two hours. Any place that is fenced with ropes or covered with plastic sheets is worth a closer look. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Copan is known as the &quot;Paris of the Mayan World&quot; and is famous for its exquisite carvings and developed culture. So why did it suddenly fall during its heyday? Was it just because it suffered a rebellion? According to the results of archaeological excavations, the decline of Copan is actually the inevitable result of ecological deterioration, and the wasted national power of the Eighteen Rabbits only accelerated this process. The city-state is located in a fertile and narrow river valley, surrounded by steep mountains and low soil fertility. With the rise of city-states and rapid population growth, the limited farmland in river valleys could not sustain their food needs, so people went to the mountains in droves to clear up wasteland. The royal family also cut down a large number of mountain trees for fuel and made plaster to smear on palace buildings for waterproofing. As a result, local Vegetation has dropped sharply, the ecology has deteriorated, and mountain landslides have occurred repeatedly, submerging fertile farmland in river valleys and further reducing crop yields. Eventually agricultural production collapsed, and the city-states were abandoned and turned into large rainforests again. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/10/11/jM4b2wvmJyMOn4acWV6Ixmd5kkoHLa9JCLxDWJjr.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1440&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/10/11/jM4b2wvmJyMOn4acWV6Ixmd5kkoHLa9JCLxDWJjr.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;211199&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The stone macaw sculpture above the court&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Wang Zaitian/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is dusk , the few tourists dispersed one after another, and I sat on a high platform beside the golf course, with a stone sculpture of a macaw head above my head. Quietly watch as the large square gradually becomes a paradise for macaws. They either glide in groups and chirp freely, or perch in pairs on branches, preening each other&#39;s feathers lovingly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fifteen hundred years ago, the Mayans used macaws as their totems and held fiery and bloody kickball games under their curious gaze. Nowadays, the Mayan civilization has disappeared, but the macaw is still the master here, and it has never changed for thousands of years. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The overlord of the Mayan world - Tikal&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The Tikal ruins are located in the Mayan rainforest in northern Guatemala. To the north and west is Mexico, a large country in Central America, and to the east is Central America. The only English speaking country is Belize. Due to the deep grass and forests, the borders between the three countries were drawn using latitude and longitude lines, and a square rectangle was drawn on the map of the Yucatan Peninsula. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Not far south from Tikal is Lake Petén Itzá, which is shaped like a hammerhead shark. )&lt;/span>; and its south coast island Flores &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: italics, italics_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>; (Flores)&lt;/span>; - the last religious center of the Mayan civilization , it was not destroyed by the cultural genocide atrocities of Spanish colonists until the end of the seventeenth century. The closest airport to Tikal is built on the land southeast of Flores Island: Mayan World International Airport. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I took a Saab 340 twin-turboprop plane from Guatemala City—probably the smallest commercial airliner I have ever flown in, with only thirty seats—under the intoxicating sunset over the lake and sky. We landed here and drove 70 kilometers to the Tikal ruins early the next morning. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/10/11/1OW5BqQAwjMkn1CCLOm8twqn0b902T1RjhLBnWK3.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1440&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/10/11/1OW5BqQAwjMkn1CCLOm8twqn0b902T1RjhLBnWK3.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;211200&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Tikal Temple No. 1&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Wang Zaitian/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tikal is a Mayan temple One of the two unparalleled heroes who stood side by side with Calakmul during the classical period of civilization. The surrounding terrain is low-lying and densely covered with swamps, and Tikal is a low hill with neither drought nor flooding. It has become a rare livable place in the Yucatan Peninsula, which is generally short of water. It has been there since at least the seventh century BC. Inhabited by the Mayans. About a thousand years later, the Maya world entered the Classical Period. With the rich local obsidian resources, Tikal could not only build sharp weapons to improve its own combat power during times of war, but also sell them to other city-states for profit in times of peace, so its national power grew rapidly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Through international trade, Tikal originated from Teotihuacan, a large country located in central Mexico There, I learned how to fight with spears. I no longer need to fight with the enemy face to face. Instead, I surround the enemy and kill them by throwing spears. This achieves a &quot;long-range strike&quot; to a certain extent, thus significantly reducing our own casualties and more effectively reducing our own casualties. Become the overlord of the Mayan world with advanced military ideas. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although Teotihuacan sent an expeditionary force to raid its students at the end of the fourth century - the straight-line distance between the two places is more than a thousand kilometers, which is equivalent to the Tang army relying entirely on boats and walking&lt;span style=&quot; font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(Teotihuacan and Mayan civilizations failed to invent wheels and vehicles)&lt;/span>;, carrying all weapons and equipment and food and grass supplies on their shoulders, starting from Chang&#39;an Expedition to Tuyuhun on the Qinghai Lake - and once fully controlled the political and military power of Tikal. But the two places were too far apart after all. Teotihuacan, which started out on the Mexican plateau, could not establish itself in the humid monsoon rainforest of the Yucatan Peninsula for a long time, so Tikal eventually regained power. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The highlight of the Copan ruins is the beautifully carved stone statues, while the highlight of Tikal is its tall pyramid. Although limited by ancient construction technology, the pyramid of Tikal cannot reach the sky, but at least it can tower through the forest. Standing on the top of the pyramid, you feel as if you are standing on the tip of a sharp sword, piercing through the endless mountains. Rainforest canopy. If you imagine the lush forest canopy as clouds, then these pyramids are like Shushan Mountain breaking through the clouds and coming out through the clouds, giving people a very majestic feeling. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/10/11/1W1L8Yf8zisdbLt0F3bJlnf8CL3OtZwlLDJKGtnO.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1440&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/10/11/1W1L8Yf8zisdbLt0F3bJlnf8CL3OtZwlLDJKGtnO.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;211201&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Tikal Temple 1-3&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Wang Zaitian/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;mentioned Are there any differences between pyramids, Mayan pyramids and Egyptian pyramids? The Egyptian pyramid, as its name suggests, is similar to the Chinese character for &quot;gold&quot;. It is a square pyramid composed of a square base and four isosceles triangles. The Mayan pyramid looks similar to the Egyptian pyramid at first glance, but if you look closely, you will find that it is not the same. A pointed cone without a top, its cross-section is an isosceles trapezoid, as if a small pyramid was cut off from the top of a large pyramid. The base is not always square. For example, several large pyramids at the Tikal site have rectangular bases, and the Uxmal site in Mexico also has the Warlock Pyramid with an oval base. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Why are there no pointed cones on the top of the Mayan pyramids? This is related to the different functions of the two types of pyramids. The Egyptian pyramid is a pharaoh&#39;s tomb, with a hollow interior, and a tomb chamber is built to store the pharaoh&#39;s mummy; the Mayan pyramid is the base of the temple, and the purpose of building it is to highlight the sublimity of the temple. Therefore, the Mayan pyramid is generally solid, in order to leave To build a temple in space, a platform must be left at the top, so there is no top cone. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In view of the different functions, the shapes and sizes of the two types of pyramids are also quite different. There is a temple on the top of the Mayan pyramid, and the priests need to go to the altar to perform rituals or observe the stars at night. Therefore, there are stone steps on both sides of the Mayan pyramid or on the central axis of the front, rear, left, and right sides; while the Egyptian pyramid is a pharaoh&#39;s tomb and does not require climbing to the top. , so there is only the entrance to the mausoleum at the bottom, and there are no stone steps leading to the top cone. Also due to sacrificial needs, Mayan pyramids are generally not high. The tallest Tikal Temple IV is only 64.6 meters, which can be said to be dwarfed by the Egyptian pyramids: Egypt&#39;s tallest Pyramid of Khufu was 146.6 meters high when it was built. After 4,500 years, Due to the erosion of wind and sand, it is still 138.8 meters high, more than twice the height of Tikal IV Temple. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since the amount of construction earthwork is proportional to the cube of the size, the Mayan pyramid is an order of magnitude smaller than the Egyptian pyramid, so the amount of building materials and engineering required is much smaller than the latter, and the number of constructions is much higher. the latter. According to incomplete statistics, there are more than 100,000 Mayan pyramids in Mexico alone, while there are only more than 100 pyramids in Egypt. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are four most important pyramids in Tikal, including one on the east and west sides of the main square, which means a couple looking at each other. Temple No. 1 on the east side was built in the mid-eighth century and is 44 meters high. It is a rare mausoleum-shaped pyramid in the Mayan world. It is the burial place of the famous Zhongxing master of Tikal, the Double Moon King _GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(Jasaw Chan K&#39;awiil I, reigned 682-734)&lt;/span>;, he led the city-state through the jungle to defeat the old enemy Calakmul in 695, leaving the latter unable to recover, and could only rely on Small tricks such as secretly fomenting rebellion and weakening Copán were used to relieve military pressure from Tikal, and Tikal entered its second heyday. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/09/30/tk9W7RDl4NjfWRt8qcIQ3gheQ3KgyxqIFyFhE9UM.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;1445&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/09/30/tk9W7RDl4NjfWRt8qcIQ3gheQ3KgyxqIFyFhE9UM.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;210475&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Shuangyuewang Stone Stele Relief&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of Wang Zaitian/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;No. 1 The stone steps of the temple are narrow and steep, causing at least two tourists to slip and fall to their deaths. Tourists are now prohibited from climbing. Temple No. 2 on the west side is also a mausoleum, where the queen of the Twin Moon King, Lady Twelve Macaw, is buried. >;. Her mausoleum is six meters shorter than her husband&#39;s pyramid, and the stone steps are wider. However, direct climbing is prohibited. Instead, wooden steps are built behind it for visitors to walk up to the top of the tower and overlook the elegant and quiet grand square. There are more than twenty stone pillars erected in the square. They have the same function as the stone statues in the main square of the Copan ruins. They are used to commemorate the achievements of the previous kings. However, the stone carving art of Tikal is far inferior to that of Copan, so there are no stone statues here but only stone pillars. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tikal&#39;s Temple No. 3 is located on the west side of Temple No. 2. The front of its base has been covered by vegetation, and it is like a slope, buried in the dense jungle, but it is 55 meters high. The top of the tower stands majestically, far higher than the surrounding trees, giving viewers a strong shock with the tenacious struggle between nature and manpower across the vicissitudes of life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, the Tikal temple we see today is the product of archaeological excavations, stripping away its trees, cleaning up its soil, and repairing its stone steps. When the European archaeological expedition first came here in the early 19th century, all the pyramids looked like Temple No. 3 now. At first glance, they were nothing more than steep mountains that suddenly rose up from the flat ground. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Temple No. 4 is located at the western end of the core area of ​​the site. It was built in 741 by the son of the Twin Moon King. It is the tallest temple in Tikal and the tallest building in the Mayan world. Looking eastward from its top platform to Temple No. 1, No. 2, and No. 3, it is easy to get the illusion that the continuous tropical rainforest trees under your feet are just a patch of low bushes, while the three temples are like three stone monuments, rising from the bushes. The bushes stretched out tenaciously - the scale of everything suddenly shrunk here, and I seemed to have entered a miniature world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/10/11/pyk0T8NZrX2ucXSOFELI9SpZDxrvzaxlVxGy7ek3.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1440&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/10/11/pyk0T8NZrX2ucXSOFELI9SpZDxrvzaxlVxGy7ek3.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;211203&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;A temple in &quot;The Lost World&quot;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Wang Zaitian/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Starting from Temple No. 4, I continued southward deep into the rainforest, looking for the ancient pyramid &quot;The Lost World&quot; which was built in 700 BC &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 毷体, 毷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;( El Mundo Perdido)&lt;/span>;. The number of tourists gradually dwindled, and only me, a group of white-nosed coatis walking happily with their long tails wagging high, and the low roars echoing in the forest were the only ones left in the dense forest. At first I thought it was just the background sound played by the park through the loudspeaker - because if any carnivorous beast really made such a loud noise, it meant that it had arrived around me and was ready to hunt at any time - and I was surprised by the unique interest of the player. Later I realized that the breathtaking roar came from the branches above my head: two medium-sized howler monkeys were crawling back and forth anxiously, announcing the territory of their group with continuous roars. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The prosperous age created by the Twin Moon King lasted for nearly a hundred years. After entering the ninth century, the entire Mayan world entered a drought period that had not been seen in seven thousand years. Starvation was everywhere and the city-states were in ruins. As the largest city-state at the time, with a population of nearly 200,000 at its peak, Tikal declined rapidly after facing famine. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The last king of Tikal who went down in history reused the name of the Twin Moon King and called himself Jasaw Chan K&#39;awiil II, but this did not allow him to defeat nature and revive the country&#39;s destiny. By the end of the 10th century, Tikal was reclaimed by nature, the cornfields no longer existed, and the majestic temples and tombs of the ancestors were covered by dense forests. From that time on, the howler monkeys established their homes in the center of the former city-state, making powerful sounds that could be heard several kilometers away. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 05 Oct 2023 22:25:02 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[为什么全国大部分打印店都“姓”湘？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257190]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-05 21:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Walking into the university campus, if you find the print shop owner saying Don’t be too surprised when you hear the rich modulations of “Shapu”, because if you continue to pay attention, you will find that this accent can even be found in print shops in the streets and alleys across the country. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Hunanese are not only the leaders in the spicy food industry, but also have great confidence in the literary and printing industry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In fact, Xinhua County, located in central Hunan, has shouldered the heavy responsibility of the &quot;Wenyinxiang Army&quot;. According to statistics, Xinhua&#39;s printing and printing industry has captured more than 95% and 70% of the market share in the national universities and the national printing and printing industry respectively. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Not only Lanzhou Ramen and Shaxian Snacks have opened stores across the country, but also Xinhuaren’s Wenyin Shop.

Many years ago, a Peking University doctoral thesis &quot;The Life History of Xinhua Copying Industry&quot; became popular on the Internet, which revealed the secret of how Xinhua people turned a piece of graphics into a 100-billion-dollar industry through &quot;teaching and mentoring&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;This small town located in a corner has a tradition of &quot;supplementing agriculture with technology&quot; since ancient times. Yangxi people accidentally learned mechanical typewriter repair technology, then united a group of repair technicians to go nationwide, and then relied on repair technology to develop the second-hand copier business, gradually realizing iterative upgrades in the text and printing industry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In the complete industrial chain of typing, copying, drawing, printing, printing equipment and remanufacturing, and consumable manufacturing and operation, more than 300,000 people Xinhua printing technicians have traveled all over the country. Under the impact of &quot;paperless office&quot;, Xinhua printing industry is still booming. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;From &quot;introduced manufacturing&quot; to &quot;independent intelligent manufacturing&quot;, Xinhua Wenyin is getting rid of the shackles and building the world&#39;s business card of &quot;Xinhua Wenyin&quot;. Today, independent intellectual property products such as high-speed inkjet blueprint machines are accelerating industry changes; Xinhua Printing has gone abroad and has settled its printing products in more than 80 countries. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Mobile phone cases, stationery, mouse pads, background walls... These DIY personalized printings that are popular among young people have also become the &quot;get rich&quot; for Xinhua Wenyin people &quot;High-gloss&quot;, new printing products represented by Meow Meow Machine, 3D printing products, etc. have created more possibilities for Xinhua Printing.

Enter Although the landscape in eastern Turkey changed to gentle slopes and the language changed to Turkic and Kurdish, the strong imprint of Islamic civilization has not weakened at all. But when you come to the northeastern border town of Karls, the cool and elegant cityscape, the streets with a checkerboard structure, the neat and straight stone roads, and even the bank branches shining warmly in the bleak autumn wind make people suddenly feel like they have traveled to a Nordic town. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The unusual origin of Kars comes from: it was occupied by Tsarist Russia for 40 years from 1878, and was planned, built and managed in a European style. of Soviet Russia was ceded to Turkey. Before that, Kars was the capital of the middle Bagratid dynasty. It was successively occupied by the Byzantines, Seljuks, Mongols and Turks in the more than 800 years after the fall of the dynasty. The Bagratid Dynasty was a mini-version established by the only remaining nobles who took advantage of the gap between the Byzantine Empire and the Arab Empire after the once vast Kingdom of Armenia, which controlled hundreds of thousands of people, was divided by the Roman Empire and the Parthian Empire. The Armenian country has been a country for 160 years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are no Armenians in Kars today, but just a hundred years ago, 84.1% of the population here was Armenian. Because the Tsarist Russian government was relatively friendly to Armenians, people from Western Armenia (generally referring to the former Armenian territory in Turkey, corresponding to Eastern Armenia, which is now the Republic of Armenia and part of Azerbaijan) who suffered discrimination and abuse from the Ottoman Turkish Empire at that time migrated to Kars , especially during World War I, the Ottoman Turkish Empire implemented a genocidal policy against the Armenians in its territory, resulting in the deaths of 1 million to 1.5 million Armenians. This is known as the Armenian Genocide in history, and even prompted Western Armenians to flee to Kars for refuge. Unfortunately, the good times did not last long. After Soviet Russia ceded Kars to Turkey, the Armenians here had to embark on a journey of survival. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;My companions and I found a small hotel to stay in - the hotel sign on Turkey Street is easy to recognize, written as otel, which comes from the French word hotel with a silent h - we were preparing to take advantage of the sun yet. Go down the mountain to see the landmark here, the Seljuk Castle built in the 12th century AD, and Celil, the famous old fox of Kars, comes to visit. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Turkey is a big tourist country, but tourists mainly go to the Aegean coast in the west, the Mediterranean coast in the south and Cappadocia in the center. Even the quiet and elegant Black Sea coast in the north is rarely visited. Not to mention eastern Turkey, which is adjacent to &quot;high-risk areas&quot; such as Syria, Iraq, Iran and the Caucasus. The rare few who make the long journey to Kars are undoubtedly to have a look at the ruins of Ani, and Celil, who has a keen sense of smell, specializes in these people&#39;s business. He can track every first-time tourist, and even the backpackers who spend a lot of money can be killed by him before they know the east, west, north, and south. Having said that, the number of tourists here is limited and it cannot support more tourism operators. The tourism transportation in Ani is not developed, so Celil has become an unavoidable broker for tourists. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Celil speaks fluent English, and this skill alone is a talent that can only be encountered within a few hundred miles. He was going to personally take a group to Ani the next day, and he had no control over the two of us. He just wanted to find a car for us and a young man from Melbourne we met on the road to go to Ani, and charged 20 lire per person - I asked about the price for chartered cars, which was 40 lire.土耳其里拉经历了2018年50%的暴跌和今年新冠疫情以来20%的贬值，如今兑换人民币只有八毛五分钱，但当时1里拉可以兑换五块多人民币，这趟包车相当于三百块钱出头，Celil就拿走了三分之一——上路以后才得知，Celil居然还向淳朴的墨尔本小伙子多要了5里拉。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;十年后又有一位华人游客来到卡尔斯，也是凑了三个人包这位Celil的车去阿尼。 Celil已由青年进入中年，刀下功夫推陈出新，原本谈好了100里拉的包车价，旅程结束后却收每人50里拉，居然还想问淳朴的德国小伙子再索取50里拉小费，被评价为“恶意的贪婪”——我偶然从网络上读到此事后不禁哑然失笑。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/20/10/22/b2DP79UXKCZMTxHbuShKPAOxXNV7e2wIj5lSlXk8.jpeg&quot;

&lt;p>;此行的目的地阿尼是巴格拉提德王朝的第四座也是最后一座都城，定都时间最长，延续了84年。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;说到重振亚美尼亚的巴格拉提德王朝，堪有一比的是领导苏格兰重获独立的罗伯特一世，也就是电影《勇敢的心》中为了家族利益而反复无常、向英格兰入侵者出卖起义军领袖威廉·华莱士之后又造反独立的苏格兰贵族罗伯特·布鲁斯，此君才是历史上真正被称为“勇敢的心”的一代枭雄。巴格拉提德王朝的开国君主阿硕特一世也是这样一位人物。亚美尼亚王国灭亡后，罗马人和波斯人在其领土上常年征战，元气大伤，结果被新崛起的阿拉伯人后来居上，成为亚美尼亚高原的征服者。公元705年，白衣大食（倭马亚王朝）派来的阿拉伯总督几乎杀尽了残存的亚美尼亚贵族，巴格拉提德家族得以幸存；四十多年后白衣大食改朝换代成了黑衣大食（阿拔斯王朝），派军队血腥镇压亚美尼亚人趁乱发动的起义，铲除了当地的民间反抗势力，而与黑衣大食哈里发长期交好的巴格拉提德家族再次幸免于难，从此一支独大，成为亚美尼亚高原上最有实力的政治和军事力量，也成了外来的阿拉伯统治者必须倚仗的本土势力。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;阿硕特一世就是在这个时候继任为家督。一边厢，阿拉伯哈里发扶植他削平周边的割据势力，成为亚美尼亚国王，指望利用他平定高加索山区的不安定因素，以便集中精力对付西面的拜占庭帝国；一边厢，拜占庭皇帝巴西尔一世希望拉拢亚美尼亚这个共同信仰上帝的国度，从而从北方侧翼对黑衣大食形成包围之势；另一边厢，阿硕特一世既想利用拜占庭人赶走阿拉伯人，又担心信仰东正教的拜占庭帝国强迫亚美尼亚使徒教会改宗，从而威胁到他的政权正统性。因此，阿硕特一世终其一生严守韬光养晦、两面三刀之道，同时与拜占庭、阿拉伯结盟交好，坐观两大帝国在高加索山前厮杀，自己专心致志做大做强亚美尼亚国力，既不让阿拉伯人得空插手本国事务，又阻止拜占庭人从高加索获得实际利益。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;阿硕特一世建国后的首座都城是巴格拉提德家族的根据地巴格让（Bagaran），他的儿子即位后把国都迁到了什拉卡凡（Shirakavan），这两个地方都在阿拉斯河（Aras）东岸。今天的阿拉斯河由于地缘政治的变迁，是亚美尼亚与土耳其、伊朗的界河，一千多年前它却是亚美尼亚的母亲河。巴格拉提德王朝把前两座首都设于阿拉斯河东岸，是为了利用河流的防御功能，将外来之敌挡在河西。到了阿硕特一世的孙子阿巴斯即位，巴格拉提德王朝羽翼已丰，才把国都迁到了阿拉斯河以西的卡尔斯，从而更好地保护由高加索通往黑海的商道，抵御拜占庭的东侵蚕食。阿巴斯的儿子阿硕特三世即位后，又把国都迁到了阿拉斯河西岸的阿尼，从此再未迁都，直至公元1045年王朝灭亡。 &lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;阿尼的另一个称号是“四十城门之城”，极言其面积广大，商旅纵横。但今天的阿尼已经只剩下一座北门，后来的征服者塞尔柱人在北门外围修了一道外墙，形成一条长廊似的瓮城，提升了城门的防御功能。这座仅存的城门遂以1064年攻陷阿尼的塞尔柱苏丹Arslan命名，称作Arslan之门。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;只剩一座城门的阿尼城还如何防守？不碍事。阿尼的地势很像吐鲁番的交河故城，它位于一座由三条河流深切而成的台地之上，东西两面都是几乎干涸的深谷，南面则是陡峭的阿拉斯河谷，形成天然的护城壕，只有北面有路通向外界，在冷兵器时代真是一座易守难攻的雄关。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;阿尼位于高加索山区以南、波斯以西、两河流域以北与小亚细亚以东的十字路口，位置十分重要，加上它傍着阿拉斯河谷，水源充沛，自古就是从伏尔加河流域穿越高加索山脉的商道汇入丝绸之路的交接点，从而见证了一个又一个古代文明的兴衰。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;除了亚美尼亚人以外，拜占庭人历史上曾三次攻打阿尼，直到1045年方攻下此城，随后阿尼成为拜占庭帝国境内与首都君士坦丁堡地位相当的东部重镇，鼎盛时期有十万居民居住在这片台地上，标志着高加索地区在拜占庭统治下进入了商业全盛时代。可惜好景不长，随着阿拉伯势力在中亚的衰落，塞尔柱人迅速崛起，抢占了阿拉伯人的生态位，进而向西击败臃肿的拜占庭军队，于1064年夺取阿尼，由此出发征伐小亚细亚，将高加索变成了自家后院。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;塞尔柱人走后，阿尼又陆续被格鲁吉亚人和库尔德人占领过，直到1239年，昙花一现的蒙古人征服阿尼，这是这座城池最后一次被攻陷——80年后的一场大地震摧毁了城内的绝大多数建筑，形成了今天所见的一片废墟。加上奥斯曼土耳其帝国横亘于地中海东岸与巴尔干半岛，断绝了西欧与东亚之间的丝路，使得阿尼的商道重镇地位不再，迅速衰败。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;奥斯曼土耳其帝国于19世纪逐步衰落后，阿尼与卡尔斯一度落入沙俄之手，一战后才回到土耳其手中。冷战时代，这里是华约与北约在亚洲的边界，苏联装甲部队一旦由此冲出高加索山区，将如潮水般涌入安纳托利亚高原，这成了土耳其多年的梦魇。土苏双方均沿阿拉斯河谷屯有重兵，阿尼作为边防要地实施军管垂四十年。直至苏联解体，亚美尼亚独立，土耳其所面临的军事威胁消逝，管制政策方有所松动。但起初游客仍需事先申请方可进入阿尼古城，就如我国的边防证制度，2003年埃尔多安上台后才予以取消。 &lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;阿尼古城被废弃了几个世纪，已基本恢复到远古时代的初始地貌，只剩下十几处最为宏伟坚固的古建筑经受住了岁月与天灾的考验，静静屹立于草丛中，默默展示着不同时代留下的文明印痕。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;圣格列高利是亚美尼亚使徒教会的创建者，曾被亚美尼亚国王梯里达底三世囚禁于地牢13年，最后以神迹促使国王皈依，建立了世界上首个基督教国家，故而被亚美尼亚人视为守护圣徒。阿尼城内现存三座以圣格列高利命名的教堂（Church of St. Gregory），其中靠近北门那座又叫Abughamrents，建于公元994年，其圆锥形屋顶和12个立面上的壁龛是典型的亚美尼亚建筑风格，在枯黄的草原上非常抢眼。由此往西可以远眺对面山崖上的岩石村庄，颇有卡帕多奇亚的即视感。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;另一座亚美尼亚风格的教堂是救世主教堂（Church of Redeemer），它虽然体量不大，却是阿尼城中最为引人驻足遐思之处。这座教堂建于公元1034～1036年间，用于珍藏拜占庭帝国馈赠的“真十字架”，也就是传说中钉死耶稣基督的十字架残片。 “真十字架”如同佛教中的佛祖舍利，在基督教世界中并不罕见，其真实性存疑。救世主教堂之所以引人入胜，在于它矗立九百多年，历经战火地震而不倒，是整个阿尼古城中唯一保存完好的古建筑，却于1957年被雷电意外击中，只剩下半边外墙与拱顶屹立于瓦砾之中，仿佛一位皮肉销蚀而骨架挺立的战士，在这片千年废墟中展示出独特的苍凉之美。 &lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;同圣索菲亚大教堂一样，阿尼主教座堂被信奉伊斯兰教的塞尔柱征服者改为清真寺，名曰“胜利”。塞尔柱人走后格鲁吉亚人和亚美尼亚人又把它改回教堂，土耳其人来了之后再次把它改为清真寺……在几轮拉锯之后，作为拜占庭式教堂建筑灵魂的拱顶轰然倒塌，于是这座主教座堂再也无人问津，就此孤独地俯瞰着脚下奔腾的阿拉斯河水。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/20/10/23/lfbdpmz14PYzPWK93qkeod9h4xfYb7bYbF7rJJBv.jpeg&quot;

&lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;主教座堂&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（王在田/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;城西另一座圣格列高利教堂亦为Trdat Mendet所建，令我不禁怀疑这是一位类似战国末期水利工程师郑国的角色，是拜占庭帝国派来消耗巴格拉提德王朝国力的。它的拱顶设计与圣索菲亚大教堂如出一辙，可惜建成没多久就塌了，如今只剩下庞大的圆形基座和一堆瓦砾。它的东北侧是一座格鲁吉亚教堂，东侧是波斯人留下的拜火教神庙，是整个阿尼城里最古老的建筑遗存。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;阿尼城的第三座圣格列高利教堂建于1215年，由一位亚美尼亚富商出资建造，见证了阿尼城最后的荣耀。只过了二十多年，蒙古人就打过来了，将平民屠戮殆尽，把城堡变成了一座营寨。后来的土耳其人把这座教堂称为Resimli Kilise，意思是壁画教堂。它隐藏在河谷半坡，从台地上不易看到。教堂外墙上有长长的亚美尼亚语铭文，内部保存了大量早期基督教壁画，线条俊逸流畅，全无同时期此类宗教宣传画的滞涩呆板。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/20/10/23/E4yrX2ktkjLLaMKgpJm3Usst2dieC7leGjLqgIt2.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;720&quot; height=&quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/20/10/23/E4yrX2ktkjLLaMKgpJm3Usst2dieC7leGjLqgIt2.jpeg&quot;

&lt;p>;古城南面的悬崖边有一座红棕色建筑，远看仿佛是给长方形厂房配了个大烟囱，建筑样式与周围的亚美尼亚式或拜占庭式教堂大相径庭，配色却差不多。这其实是土耳其历史上第一座清真寺，由塞尔柱人始建于1072年，采用了亚美尼亚式红黑相间的配色风格，那根“大烟囱”是一座宣礼塔，只是塔顶已经坍塌了。从清真寺俯瞰阿拉斯河谷，谷底有圣母修道院和断桥，河对岸就是亚美尼亚。由于土耳其与亚美尼亚是世仇，迄今尚未建立外交关系，两国边境自然也互不开放。 &lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;可惜受到民族仇恨与地缘政治的阻隔，亚美尼亚人与这座千年古都仅一河之隔，却无法探访。无独有偶，亚美尼亚文明的精神图腾阿勒山也被划归土耳其，亚美尼亚人只能在这座完美锥形火山脚下的边境线外仰视，尽管近在咫尺却无法靠近一步。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;阿尼与阿勒山，可都是亚美尼亚民族可望而不可即的文化之根啊！ &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot;

&lt;p>;这种议论是职场中年危机的投射。很多人工作十多年，年富力强，面临职场压力乃至失业危机。应届毕业生在市场上的工作机会多，公务员岗位也对其全额开放，倾斜录取。就连公务员考试本身，应届生也更有优势。大量年轻人涌进公务系统，中年人承受职场压力，他们认为其中有不合理之处。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;中年人只是年龄稍大，说到精力旺盛、工作勤勉，他们哪一样都不输年轻人。说到做事经验和沟通协调，三十多岁中年人的能力，远非初出校门的应届学生所能比。不得不说，这种抱怨是有道理的。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一直以来公务员系统青睐应届生，大致因为：大学生文化程度高，学习新事物快，可塑性强。在大学生稀缺的年代确实如此。可当下中年人也多是大学生，文化水平和工作能力完全能胜任，过去那个理由站不住脚了。其实，最重要的原因是：缓解就业压力。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;每年高校毕业季，大学生一下子涌入市场，短期就业压力非常大。招录公务员，把岗位“留给”他们，经济不景气的年份甚至不惜扩招，以此缓解就业压力。这似乎是一举两得、无可挑剔的安排。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;不过，公务员招收大学生，没有真正解决就业问题，因为公务员靠税收供养。而创造财富与税收，还得靠企业生产经营。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;而从实际需求看，选用有一定社会经验者任公务员，似乎更合理。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;中国的公务员职位一般分综合管理、专业技术和行政执法等类别。专业技术岗人数少、要求高，年轻人通常没机会；行政执法岗履行处罚、监管、稽查等责，所涉事务重大，人际互动紧张，刚工作的新人往往很难胜任。一线执法工作有“师徒”传统，原因就在这里。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;而在人数最多、处理事务最广的综合管理岗，要与人交往，涉及公民基础权利。即便简单的窗口办事员，其办事能力、效率和责任心，都会带来重大影响。更多的综合管理岗位，上承领导意志，下临商户和个人，他们在法律框架内办事的同时，有很大的个人判断空间。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一个刚走出校门就踏入公门，缺乏社会阅历，没有工作经验的年轻人，某种程度说，称得上不知人间疾苦。其办事和管理，却与公民利益息息相关。特别是行政执法岗，执法人员手掌翻覆，往往干系他人家庭悲欢。这样是否妥当呢？&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;从这个角度说，有长期工作经验，处理过复杂关系的中年人，可能更适合公务员工作。不是说他们比年轻人慈悲，而是更能理解复杂事情，体察人世艰辛，做出适当的处置。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;近几年我们从媒体看到，个别公务员执法僵化。举几个例子吧，比如今年3月，福州一家小吃店新开业，在门口摆了几个开业花篮，被认定“占道经营”，还未开张就罚一笔钱。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;今年7月，河南一位蹬三轮车卖菜的大爷，因销售不合格蔬菜，领到“天价罚单”。他卖菜获利21.05元，被罚款11万元。外人觉得匪夷所思，执法者振振有词，也能找出依据。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;卖菜被罚之外，农村有一种极具争议的罚款项目。农民杀掉自家养的猪，如果只是自家吃肉，问题还不算大。倘若卖几斤肉给邻居，就要面临几万元罚款。这种事情放在过去简直不可想象，现在却成为农村社会常见的罚款项目。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这些政策和处罚的决策者，当都是中年以上干部，看起来与年轻人无关——实际他们过去也是年轻公务员。大学刚一毕业，就进入官场。人际互动简单，主要是服从或指令；财务经验很少，以花钱为主，没有过缺钱找钱的日子。职业公务员擅长文牍会务，接触人群有限。与真实社会有隔阂。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;基于这个理由，我赞成当代中年人的呼吁，开放公务员考试的年龄限制。不仅放开上限，最好规定下限。比如可以讨论禁止应届毕业生考取公务员——他们需要走进社会，有所历练，才谈得上管理和服务公众。除少量简单的技术性、内务型公务员，大部分公务员岗位都应设立年龄要求，考察工作能力，以确保他们称职。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;考虑到工作履历和能力相对主观，年龄这一项就显得特别重要。市场上的公司招聘，会对求职者的工作年限和经验提要求，越重要的岗位，要求越高，一旦发现不称职，很快降级直至解雇。相比而言，公务员的招录尺度就简单得多——几乎只凭考试成绩一项，且无失业之虞。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当前公务员招录和考核模式，有很大改革空间。改革之目标，在于公务员多接地气，减少僚气。增加年龄要求，考察专业履历，增加合同聘任制的比重，都是可以尝试的方向。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;

&lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Director Zeng Guoxiang. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some eyes are only for teenagers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the movie &quot;Young You&quot;, Chen Nian and Xiao Bei, two low-income teenagers whose parents have neglected their duties, are like two helpless little animals who need to hug each other for warmth and lick each other&#39;s wounds. When one party accidentally did something wrong and faced jail time, the other party decided to stand up and &quot;take the blame&quot;, completing an agreement that could change their fate almost instantly. There is no verbal communication, the eyes are enough to show the firm trust, and he will not hesitate to be broken into pieces. Director Tsang Kwok-hsiang is well aware of the value of a young man&#39;s eyes, so he shot a large number of close-ups, hoping to show the fire in the young man&#39;s eyes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The eyes were exchanged again, and the location shifted to the visiting room of the detention center. A glass wall separates them from two worlds. The young man&#39;s face overlaps on the glass. You are in me, and I am in you. There should have been a thousand words, but once again, there were no words, just looking at each other, tears streaming down their faces. Soon, their fate will be reversed again. This is also a scene that makes Zeng Guoxiang proud. He insisted on not having any dialogue and what he wanted to say was expressed clearly in his eyes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As of November 6, 2019, the 13th day of release, this movie focusing on college entrance examinations, tutoring and campus bullying has grossed more than 1.2 billion yuan at the box office and has a Douban score of 8.4. Yi Yang Qianxi, who plays Xiaobei, gave an impressive performance, which made him far away from the label of &quot;traffic star&quot;. The discussion also went beyond the movie itself, with many viewers recalling the joys and sorrows of their own growth. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Young You&quot; tells an alternative story about the college entrance examination. In the college entrance examination re-reading class, Chen Nian, a good student played by Zhou Dongyu, witnessed his friends being bullied on campus and chose to shut up. Unfortunately, he himself became a victim of bullying. She is focused on completing more important things, that is, relying on the college entrance examination to change the fate of herself and her mother who ran away to avoid debts. Xiaobei is a &quot;little gangster&quot; who was abandoned by his parents since he was a child and grew up on the streets. They came together by an accident, and Xiaobei soon appeared silently like a shadow on Chen Nian&#39;s way to and from school, protecting her from bullying. How could life be normal? One &quot;derailment&quot; and the dominoes fell. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhou Dongyu has always been quirky and casual, which is often the case in movies. In her first film &quot;July and Ansheng&quot;, which she collaborated with Zeng Guoxiang, she just acted according to her personality, and the director just captured the moments that felt useful. But in &quot;Young You&quot;, Zeng Guoxiang repeatedly told her: &quot;I don&#39;t want Zhou Dongyu.&quot; Many times, Zhou Dongyu almost collapsed. She especially couldn&#39;t understand that if Chen Nian was beaten, he could just beat him back. Why endure it? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I kept explaining to her, because you are not only carrying your own destiny, but also your mother&#39;s future.&quot; Zeng Guoxiang recalled. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zeng Guoxiang also needs to know more things. At first, he could not appreciate the great significance of the college entrance examination to the individual. His father is the famous actor Eric Tsang. He completed his studies in Canada, and his background is very different from that of mainland candidates. He watched a lot of documentaries about the college entrance examination and read related books. During the two days of the college entrance examination, he and his team stayed outside a middle school in Chongqing to capture photos. They stayed there from six or seven in the morning until the students left the examination room, and then they stopped working. Those two days meant a lot to him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The film was shot in Chongqing, and there are many scenes worth pondering. There is a spiral bridge next to the school, which looks like the Colosseum in ancient Rome, reminiscent of the atmosphere of the college entrance examination; at the same time, it spirals upward, like a metaphor for youth growth, and a turning point in the story is also placed here. In real life, this is just a pedestrian bridge at Tongyuanju Subway Station on Chongqing Metro Line 3. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“It’s like a maze. These young children can’t seem to get out of this world. We chose Chongqing because the city has many ups and downs, highs and lows, and many winding alleys. It feels like it takes forever to walk. You can&#39;t leave this place. There are viaducts and buildings everywhere you go, which gives you a feeling of pressure. We hope to present this sense of oppression and the feeling of being trapped in a place in the movie.&quot; Zeng Guoxiang said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On November 1, 2019, Zeng Guoxiang accepted an exclusive interview with Southern Weekend. &lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;&quot;To make a good movie, you must consider things from each character&quot;&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: italics , Italics_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;&quot;Young You&quot; has aroused a very enthusiastic response. What do you think triggered the audience&#39;s enthusiasm? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Zeng Guoxiang:&lt;/strong>;At least in Chinese-language movies, the pain of growing up and school bullying are rarely discussed in this way. I didn&#39;t expect the response to be so big. Of course, when I wanted to make this movie, I also hoped to have such an effect. Let everyone reflect and show a little care and love to the people around them, which can have a positive impact. I have always felt that adolescence is a period that particularly needs protection and protection. Teenagers feel that the world is not good enough. The idea that they can change the world is particularly valuable and requires the protection and protection of adults. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;But in &quot;Young You&quot;, parents are collectively missing of. Chen Nian kept asking where the adults were when she was bullied. What are your thoughts? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Zeng Guoxiang:&lt;/strong>;I don’t want to put the responsibility on anyone. Everyone has the responsibility. This matter is extremely complicated and is not just a problem for parents. Of course, the biggest influence on a child is the parents, but we explained the state of her family in the movie. Everyone is a little powerless, and they don’t treat others like this on purpose. Sometimes the environment is like this, and people like this are formed, and things like this happen. The same goes for schools, teachers, and other students. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Before filming the movie, did you have any interviews with mainland campuses and senior high school students? Do some homework? Have you combined your own experience? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Zeng Guoxiang:&lt;/strong>;We knew at the script stage that the college entrance examination would be a very important element. In fact, it is the timeline and backbone of the entire story. As the coming-of-age ceremony for this group of teenagers, the college entrance examination is a very, very important step. We did a lot of homework before filming. As a Hong Kong director who &quot;went north&quot;, I felt a lot of pressure to shoot such realistic subjects. I want to make sure that the things I shoot are down to earth. After watching it, everyone will feel that this is how they came here. This is the atmosphere during the college entrance examination. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At that time, I read a lot of documentaries and books about the college entrance examination, talked to some teachers and students about their state during the college entrance examination, and talked to the staff or friends around me about how they passed the college entrance examination. The filming of this film started in Chongqing in mid-July 2018. During the two days of the college entrance examination in June, we went to the examination room to capture photos. We stayed there from 6 or 7 in the morning until the students left the examination room after taking the exam before calling it a day and returning. Those two days were particularly meaningful to me. We observed many details and restored them in the movie. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;What are the details? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Zeng Guoxiang:&lt;/strong>;We took pictures of the entire college entrance examination, what clothes parents wore, what they brought students to the examination room, the students’ state and eyes before entering the examination room, What to talk about. We tried our best to faithfully restore what we saw in the movie. Apart from the school uniforms, it does take into account the art of the movie, so it will be made a little neater and more beautiful, but not excessive. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I didn’t put too much of my own experience into the movie. After all, my growing up experience was so different from that of the students in the movie. I just tried to refer to a lot of information and materials and tried to restore what I found interesting. It&#39;s hard for me to say how I feel about it. I can only say that I sympathize with them very much and understand their pressure. Before making this movie, I had been paying attention to the news about the college entrance examination. There were many characters and stories in it, which were very interesting. Every student is burdened with heavy pressure, which is unfamiliar to me and particularly touches me. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although I also experienced the college entrance examination, in Canada at that time, we were quite relaxed. Although it is also a very important exam, I don’t take it that seriously. I think it is an exam that will change our future destiny. When I started working in the Mainland, I came across news reports about the college entrance examination one after another. I was particularly distressed by how much sweat some students put into preparing for the college entrance examination and how much pressure they had to bear. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You majored in sociology at university. Did your professional background help? There are richer sociological issues implicit in &quot;Young You&quot;, such as class and upward mobility. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Zeng Guoxiang: &lt;/strong>;Sociology taught me how to have empathy; after leaving school, sociology taught me how to approach the perspective of different classes, countries, and races. , see things from their perspective. During this filming on campus or before, I worked as a screenwriter and wrote the script. What is the background of each character, what will happen, how to make him have his current values, and his attitude towards things. This is a very big help. . As a director, to make a good movie, you must consider things from each character. &lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;&quot;Use close-up to show the fire in their eyes&quot;&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti ;&quot;>;You and Zhou Dongyu collaborated in &quot;July and Ansheng&quot;. At that time, you asked her to &quot;spare her acting&quot; and capture her suitable moments. Did you take the same approach this time? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Zeng Guoxiang: &lt;/strong>;No. After &quot;July and Ansheng&quot;, there will actually be pressure for us to work together again, because no one wants to repeat what we have done. When I photographed her before, I tried to capture her normal feeling, always going with her more naughty and casual feeling. But this time I suppressed all her past and told her very clearly that I don’t want the Zhou Dongyu of the past, and I hope that everyone can see a very different Zhou Dongyu. She understands very well and wants to find a breakthrough. During this collaboration, what I told her the most was &quot;I don&#39;t want Zhou Dongyu.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;In &quot;Young You&quot;, the audience saw the big Zhou Dongyu Sometimes she is extremely tolerant. For example, she was always bullied by a group of girls in school. It is said that she was very dissatisfied during the filming. According to her character, it would be fine if she was bullied and beaten back. Why should she endure it? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Zeng Guoxiang: &lt;/strong>;She was very entangled when she first started filming. She couldn&#39;t believe it: Why do you have to endure it like this? I kept explaining to her that because you are not only burdened with your own destiny, but also your mother&#39;s future, if you resist and speak out, the result will be that you will not be able to study, review, and take the college entrance examination properly. The latter is more important to you than anything else. important. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So I choose to close my eyes. I feel dissatisfied when others are bullied and cannot bear to see them, but don’t speak out. Later, she became the target of bullying, but she still chose to endure it, because she felt that everything would be fine after this year, and she would be able to leave this place and get into a good university. Her fate was different from that of her mother. So she has been under so much pressure and struggling. I kept explaining to Zhou Dongyu, and after the scene with her mother was finished, she gradually understood. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;There is a scene in the movie that is very impressive. Two teenagers are visiting a prison. faces overlapped on the glass. You also used many close-ups of characters&#39; faces in the film. Is this an aesthetic consideration? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Zeng Guoxiang:&lt;/strong>;The method of overlapping faces is not my innovation. It has been done in many movies, but I think it is very suitable here. I have been analyzing this with the actors, and later on in the interrogation scene, the two people have become one. In the close-up of each person, there is a reflection of another person, that is, I am in you, and you are in me. I like to use a lot of close-ups in my previous films, but this time there are a lot more. Not only the close-ups of the main actors, but also the close-ups of many students, I wanted to capture the eyes and expressions of these teenagers. The young you and the young me have to show the innocence and straightforwardness of their youth. I hope to use close-ups to show the fire in their eyes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;In addition to Zhou Dongyu, Yi Yang Qianxi’s performance in the movie is also good That’s interesting. What specific “training” did you do? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Zeng Guoxiang: &lt;/strong>;It’s not that I changed him. Maybe people were biased against him before, labeling him an “idol” and a top traffic person. &quot;Little fresh meat&quot;, I immediately felt that he couldn&#39;t act. Everyone has not seen him act fairly, but he is actually a very serious boy. From the first day we chatted, to the time he joined the cast, he was really attentive and determined to be a good actor and play the role of Xiaobei well. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the scene where Xiaobei and Chen Nian were chatting about Xiaobei’s mother on the bed, I actually didn’t tell him that I wanted to cry at all. I just talked to him and explained his relationship with his mother. He brewed it by himself and acted it out. When the emotion arrived, tears naturally flowed down his face. This shows that Qian Xi himself is a very sensitive boy, and the mother-son relationship allows him to find the fulcrum to enter the character. &lt;/p>; &lt;h3>;“I hope to give the actors a sense of security on the set”&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_ GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Yi Yang Qianxi and Zhou Dongyu had a rivalry scene. When the two first came into contact, he pushed Zhou Dongyu into the corner. This scene was very tense and the scale was right. How did you explain the scene to him at that time? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Zeng Guoxiang: &lt;/strong>;This is a very good point. He was a little nervous at first. He had never had the experience of pressing a girl against the wall, so he was very embarrassed and shy and didn&#39;t know how to act. I also took a lot of shots during that scene, and I kept guiding and demonstrating to him how to do it. He also needed some time to adjust slowly. Patting and patting, he slowly let go, and we were able to reach the degree we needed. He is a very good actor, but he doesn’t have that much experience. We need to talk to him more and give him more time to meet our requirements for him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Wei Lai, the perpetrator of campus bullying in the movie, happens to be a A very good-looking girl with a good family background. What are your considerations? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Zeng Guoxiang: &lt;/strong>;We met the actors and wrote the script at the same time. I have always been confused about what kind of person to choose to play the role. I don’t want her to become so superficial. In many movies, one look at the person&#39;s appearance and you know that they are definitely the head of the bully, which we want to avoid as much as possible. I met many actors and kept an open attitude to see what kind of people I could meet that would inspire me. Later we met Zhou Ye, and it was actually she who inspired us to think this way. The day she came, we had a strong feeling that she was very confident, and then she was so beautiful and cute. At that time, we felt that if we cast such a person, with such a high starting point, and bullying others, the cruelty would be even stronger. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many times, the people who have the least empathy do not necessarily have poor families or bad backgrounds. Instead, those with good family backgrounds but distorted family views are the most terrifying. They think that others can do whatever they want. I&#39;m at my mercy. So we set it from the beginning that Wei Lai has a good family environment and is good at studying, but her family view is very distorted and she has no empathy. She doesn&#39;t feel that she is doing anything wrong to others. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;To sum up, do you have any unique experience in &quot;training&quot; actors? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Zeng Guoxiang:&lt;/strong>;I have no secret, I am still very honest with actors. I hope to give the actors a sense of security on set, which is very important. Actors often bare their hearts to the audience. If they don&#39;t trust the director and the team, they will often protect themselves and their performance will not be that good. What the director can do is to invest more, shoot this point well, and consider their feelings more. Small things like this allow the actors to slowly build trust in you as the director, and then they will trust your opinions and tips. I often let the actors play the version they think is most correct, and I make adjustments based on that. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 05 Oct 2023 17:55:10 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[我的家乡重庆丨月是故乡明⑤]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257350]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-05 17:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/ 12/02/nszAcS51cXSdJFRcz6yYfmyY5xfdkskn6p7vDzSc.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;940&quot; height=&quot;660&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/12/02/nszAcS51cXSdJFRcz6yYfmyY5xfdkskn6p7v DzSc. jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;174010&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On May 1, 2012, in Ciqikou, Chongqing, citizens raised the Drinking tea and chatting on the rocks &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Liu Song/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;My hometown, Chongqing, is located in the southwest of China&#39;s inland area and the upper reaches of the Yangtze River.

The Shucheng County People&#39;s Court sentenced Yan Guang to 20 years in prison for eight crimes including participating in a gangland organization, robbery, picking quarrels and provoking trouble, forced transactions, and extortion. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Around 2002, Bian modified the contract for the Sanli Street Slaughterhouse. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sun Changquan’s younger brother recalled to Southern Weekend reporters that after contracting the Sanli Street Slaughterhouse, Bian Xiangxi and Sun Changquan met after being introduced by a then leader of the Matoji Police Station. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Shucheng County Procuratorate alleged that while contracting the Sanli Street Slaughterhouse to engage in the fixed-point slaughtering business of pork, Bian Xiu met Sun Changquan, then president of the Yuan District Commerce and Circulation Association of Lu&#39;an City, who took advantage of his power , arranged for the state-owned Yu&#39;an District Food Company (hereinafter referred to as the &quot;Food Company&quot;) and the Yu&#39;an District Commercial Administrative Law Enforcement Brigade to suppress Bian Xiu&#39;s business competitors. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Just when Bian Xiu was developing his pig business through his network and everything was going smoothly, his biggest competitor since he started business appeared. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On August 5, 2005, the Lu&#39;an Municipal People&#39;s Government signed an investment agreement with Hong Kong Xishang Investment Group Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as &quot;Xisshang Group&quot;). The Lu&#39;an Municipal Government promised to close other pig slaughterhouses in the city after the project is put into operation, and determined Xishang Group to be the only designated pig slaughtering plant in the city. At the same time, the office of the city&#39;s designated pig slaughtering management department will be located in Xishang Company. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In December 2006, the Lu&#39;an Municipal Government Office issued Document No. 80, announcing the closure of three slaughterhouses in the city, including the Sanli Street slaughterhouse contracted by Bian Modi. In early 2007, the Sanli Street Slaughterhouse was officially closed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Case materials show that Bian Xiuxiu and Xishang Group had constant conflicts, and both parties reported to each other. In December 2006, Bian Xiangxiu led dozens of people to forcibly prevent Xishang Company&#39;s pork products from entering the Nanmen Farmers Market. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On May 18, 2007, the Lu&#39;an Municipal Economic Development and Environmental Protection Committee Office submitted an investigation report to the municipal government, recommending that the public security organs launch an investigation into Bian Xiu and his associates who are suspected of being evil forces. , and at the same time, the Discipline Inspection Commission launched an investigation into Sun Changquan, then deputy director of the Commerce Bureau. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the storm did not have a substantial impact on Bian and Sun. The transcript shows that after being reported by the Xishang Group, Bian Xiu went out to Hefei briefly and then returned to Lu&#39;an. Sun Changquan&#39;s position remained unchanged. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On June 1, 2008, under the witness of the Lu&#39;an City Livestock and Poultry Slaughter Management Office, the Industrial and Commercial Bureau and other units, Xishang Company and Bian Modified reached an agreement that &quot;pork from urban areas will not be sent to the countryside, and pork from rural areas will not be sent to the countryside.&quot; &quot;Not entering the city&quot; agreement, the former occupies the urban market, the latter occupies the rural market, and the two parties do not interfere with each other. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2012, Bian Xiuqiu successfully obtained the qualification to carry out designated pig slaughtering in urban areas through the acquisition of Lu&#39;an Tianan Food Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as Tianan Company). So far, Bian Xiu has a certain monopoly position in Lu&#39;an&#39;s pork market. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sun Changquan&#39;s official career has also been smooth, and he has served as deputy director of the Yu&#39;an District Commerce Bureau, director of the Yu&#39;an District Key Project Construction Management Bureau, director of the Yu&#39;an District Real Estate Bureau, and director of the Real Estate Management Service Center. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sun Changquan did not deny his special relationship with Bian Xiu, admitting that the two had been in contact and understanding each other for many years, and confessed that Bian had bribed others for the pork business. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, Sun Changquan confessed that in the process of acquiring the qualification to carry out pig slaughtering in urban areas through the acquisition of Tianan Company, a leader in Yu&#39;an District who was in charge of the pilot work of building a &quot;safe meat&quot; system summoned the pig office , the District Discipline Inspection Commission, the District State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission, the District Audit Bureau, the District Government Office and other units held several meetings and proposed that Tianan Company be handed over to Bian Xiu for exclusive management. In return, Bian Xiu paid for the leader&#39;s facade house. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On September 27, 2023, the Anhui Discipline Inspection and Supervision website issued a notice stating that the leader had repeatedly violated regulations from 2013 to 2022 by accepting high-end liquor, gift cards, banquets and travel from management and service objects. Arrangement, he was dismissed from his post by the government and demoted to a fourth-level chief clerk. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;The supervision team made an unannounced visit&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Bian Momo, whose career is getting bigger and bigger, deliberately spends money to protect himself. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The case record shows that at the end of 2015, on the recommendation of a leader of the Yu&#39;an District CPPCC, Bian Xiu, who had not graduated from elementary school, fabricated his undergraduate degree and was successfully elected as a member of the district CPPCC. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In early 2017, with the help of this leader, Bian modified and joined a certain democratic party. Afterwards, Bian Xiamian purchased a facade house worth more than 1.1 million yuan for him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The rewards are also huge.卞修改名下五家公司里有三家从事生猪、生牛定点屠宰业务，而在裕安区，有相关业务资质的企业仅有四家。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但已获得垄断地位的卞修改并未满足于此。除了要求生猪办对西商公司流入农村市场的猪肉进行监管、对裕安区外屠宰并流入农村市场销售的“外埠肉”进行稽查外，卞修改还通过强行要求前来屠宰的屠户用猪内脏抵扣屠宰费，以此对区内肉类屠宰市场进行垄断、打击。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;判决书记载，2013年年初，因为不满一屠户想要拿回屠宰的生猪猪内脏，严光公然对其实施辱骂、殴打，最终掐其脖子推出屠宰场。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;为何不收屠宰费却要强行拿走猪下水？一位曾于2017年从天安公司统一收购猪下水的经营商介绍，多年来，一副猪内脏的价格最低为90元，最高时能达到150元，非洲猪瘟流行时，价格还要更高，而屠宰费价格一般几十元，价值远低于猪内脏。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;经舒城安泰会计师事务所审计，2013年3月至2021年9月，卞修改的两家公司共代宰超过113万头生猪，并用猪内脏抵扣生猪屠宰费的形式，获得7175.6167万元非法收入。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2020年9月，八十多位猪肉小贩联名递交检举信，举报卞修改等人涉黑涉恶。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2021年9月4日下午，国务院第八次大督查第八督导组来到裕安区督查暗访。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;裕安区人民政府办公室同月撰写的情况报告显示，督查主要围绕三项具体民生问题开展：一小区拆迁安置费用问题、一小区水表更换收费问题，以及区内生猪产品流通销售难问题。执法人员打击干扰商户、卞修改名下一处顺鑫屠宰场存在垄断行为等问题也被写入报告当中。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2021年9月4日起连续3天，就生猪屠宰销售问题，时任裕安区区委书记召开4场会议。 9月5日，裕安区政府成立专门的生猪流通领域问题调查组，由7个单位分别牵头开展调查。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2021年9月4日，裕安区政府通报称此前施行的外埠畜产品入裕安备案登记不符合相关法律规定已决定取消。同日，原畜禽屠宰联合执法队撤销，相关责任人也被纪委问责。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这起督查事件在一个月后正式办结。 2021年10月11日裕安区委印发办结报告文件，当中提到，2013年以来，裕安区政府办接连7次下发过生猪屠宰管理工作文件，但经裕安区司法局合法性审查，相关文件均被废止，天安公司法定代表人卞修改也被公安机关刑事拘留并立案侦查。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;“深度交织”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;2021年11月21日、2022年1月18日、2022年7月22日，六安市公安局先后三次面向社会征集卞修改涉黑涉恶犯罪团伙的违法犯罪线索。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;孙长权的辩护人介绍，该案最初由裕安分局立案侦查，后经六安市公安局提级管辖侦查，并指定舒城县公安局进一步侦查，2022年9月27日，该案移送舒城县人民检察院审查起诉。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;法院审理认为，以卞修改、孙长权为首的黑社会团伙，2001年至2007年为初步形成阶段，2012年至2021年，该团伙“通过公权力和组织势力的深度交织，形成一个密不可分的统一整体”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;法院审理认为，卞修改、孙长权犯罪团伙共实施2起抢劫行为，并从2007年开始以执法为名，打压其他肉产品经营者，构成寻衅滋事罪。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;1997年，国务院实施《生猪屠宰管理条例》，在全国推行生猪定点屠宰、集中检疫制度。次年，六安市生猪屠宰管理办公室成立，下设生猪市场稽查大队，负责全市生猪定点屠宰的管理、协调、监督、检查工作。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;由裕安区商务局印发的文件显示，为贯彻落实国务院《生猪屠宰管理条例》规定，裕安区商务局于2000年成立了商务执法稽查中队，由商务局副局长兼任中队长，负责对区内的生猪非定点屠宰、销售，以及活猪外运等内容进行稽查。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2013年6月9日《裕安区“放心肉”体系建设工作总结》中提到，依据《加强外埠冷鲜肉管理》文件，裕安区对外部猪肉进行全程监管，设立报检点，以维护裕安区肉类食品市场秩序。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;南方周末记者统计发现，在与寻衅滋事罪相关的犯罪事实中，共有103件与该犯罪团伙没收其他经营户的肉制品，或阻止其运输、售卖相关，另有7起事实由天安公司强迫屠户以猪下水抵屠宰费等引起。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;孙长权的辩护人认为，在公诉机关指控的一百多起寻衅滋事违法犯罪行动，除了少数几起是因为被害人销售不合格肉品被执法，其余均是因生猪办对外埠肉的稽查而产生的，在当地明确规定生猪办可对外埠肉实施市场准入的情况下，因对政策执行或理解所产生的偏差不应该被认定为是寻衅滋事行为。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;此外，关于抢劫罪，一起犯罪事实发生在2013年10月10日早上6点。当时，天安公司副总经理带队，以六安市城区生猪产品流通管理办法要求，城区生猪产品必须向市商务局申请登记备案，需要“二次报检”为由，对“雨润猪肉专卖店”销售的外地猪肉进行查扣。其间，老板詹显曾持刀阻止并报警，后卞修改、孙帮胜赶到现场，几人发生肢体冲突，店内冷库存放的600斤猪肉最终被查扣。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;孙帮胜也是本案被告人之一，舒城县人民法院以犯黑社会性质组织罪、抢劫罪、寻衅滋事罪判处孙帮胜有期徒刑12年6个月。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;南方周末记者尝试向詹显了解更多当年的信息，但他表示时隔太久，不愿再提。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;除了与生猪买卖相关的犯罪事实，一审判决中还提到，在卞修改的猪肉生意起步的同时，2010年起，卞修改也同孙长权一起进军房地产领域，开发了多个房地产项目，但第一笔启动资金来自挪用的公款。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 05 Oct 2023 16:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[这一天，七位中国选手得到了他们迟到的奖牌]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258110]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-05 15:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;2023年10月4日晚，中国田径运动员递补奥运奖牌仪式在杭州奥体中心体育场举行。&quot;

&lt;p>;在2021年进行的东京奥运会男子4x100米接力决赛上，中国队跑出37秒79的成绩位居第四，意大利队、英国队和加拿大队分获前三名。根据国际体育仲裁法庭2022年2月认定，英国运动员吉津杜·乌贾被查出在东京奥运会期间违反了反兴奋剂条例，因此英国队在男子4X100米接力决赛的成绩被取消，并被剥夺银牌。 2022年5月19日，国际奥委会宣布中国队从第四名升至第三名，递补获得东京奥运会男子4X100米接力铜牌。这是中国男子4x100米接力队在奥运会上获得的首枚奖牌。 &lt;/p>;
