If you are a local, at least you will have a relative or friend who is in the spicy tiao business. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Data show that the scale of China’s snack food industry has increased to 1.17 trillion yuan, and is expected to grow to 1.24 trillion yuan by 2027. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Across the country, hot-tiao companies founded by people whose ancestral home is in Pingjiang account for more than 90% of the entire industry. The total output value of hot-tiao in the country is 58 billion yuan, and Pingjiang County accounts for more than one-third, as high as 20 billion yuan. Yuan. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1998, Pingjiang people Qiu Pingjiang, Li Mengneng, and Zhong Qingyuan invented spicy strips. However, at the beginning of the development of the spicy strip industry, there were no relevant standards and the market had not yet taken shape. After years of development, the national spicy tiao industry has gradually become standardized. In 2019, the spicy tiao market reached tens of billions. The spicy tiao industry continues to grow. The sales model of the spicy tiao industry is innovative, and online channels have significant dividends. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, as the industry develops more and more maturely, more and more players have entered the game. Faced with tens of billions of cakes, snacks have begun to involuntarily compete. Competition for spicy snacks has become fiercer. Strength, seize the crowded track. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Research reports show that by 2027, China’s snack food market will enter a stock era. This will also mean that the zero-sum game between giants in various fields has begun. In addition, the leading giants of spicy noodles have successively increased their prices, and consumers are gradually unwilling to pay the bill. The future of the giants may not be easy. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is worth noting that in addition to increasingly fierce competition, spicy strips have also been criticized as &quot;unhealthy snacks&quot;. The label of spicy strips is inseparable from &quot;high oil, high salt and high sugar&quot;. Continuous large intake will increase the risk of metabolic diseases such as obesity and hypertension. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Moreover, the types of spicy strips on the market vary from good to bad, and some are illegally produced by &quot;three noes&quot; small workshops. As of April 8, 2022, there have been more than 600 complaints about a certain spicy strip brand. The main problems include ingestion of foreign matter, expiration and deterioration, etc. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this context, Pingjiang supports the &quot;second entrepreneurship&quot; of snack food companies to improve quality and expand capacity, create high-quality &quot;local specialties&quot;, and sing the &quot;revitalization song&quot; of enriching the people and strengthening the county with characteristic industries. . &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For other latecomers in the spicy noodle industry, they should embrace the trend in advance and do a good job in the health, quality and authenticity of spicy noodle in order to gain a firm foothold in the market and not be ignored by young consumers. disuse. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Today, &quot;Know&quot; will take you to see the past and present life of &quot;The Rising City of Latiao&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/06/bcb1cc40d26b3257fc405b33e35bf1b2.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;853&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/06/bcb1cc40d26b3257fc405b33e35bf1b2.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;260865&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/06/94561c277485394ddc8601468d7cca9c.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width =&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;1439&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/06/94561c277485394ddc8601468d7cca9c.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;260866&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/06/51ce5f0a64391e9b1945ae6aafeb927c.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;1440&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/06/51ce5f0a64391e9b1945ae6aafeb927c.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;260867&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p >;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/06/3bf049261c1eef96c50519e9e1e5eb1b.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;1439&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/06/3bf049261c1eef96c50519e9e1e5eb1b.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;260869&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt; img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/06/30f0b099f06887f14ae6be5a27bf45fc.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;1439&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/06/30f0b099f06887f14ae6be5a27bf45fc.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;260870&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src =&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/06/d629ac1f39568f0600f51b604a180bd1.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;1440 &quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/06/d629ac1f39568f0600f51b604a180bd1.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;260871&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot; https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/06/0009f09a958d8d206dfa0daf58b6766e.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;1439&quot; data -src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/06/0009f09a958d8d206dfa0daf58b6766e.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;260873&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 06 Dec 2023 17:25:04 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[流浪狗直播间造假：卖惨、带货、拉黑]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261960]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-12-06 16:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;On the live broadcast platform, some stray dog ​​live broadcast rooms claim to have adopted dozens of stray dogs.

(Visual China Picture)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;More than a dozen small plastic beds are placed together, and the ground is squeezed so that there are almost no gaps. In the narrow space, there are about thirty dog ​​kennels in a pile. Their hair is messy, they are extremely thin, and most of them are lethargic. They only move and lick their fur occasionally. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A piece of sensational music is playing in a loop, accompanied by a recorded audio, claiming that these are stray dogs rescued by the anchor. We hope that caring people can click to buy the dog food in the shopping cart of the live broadcast room to support the community. They offer love. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The anchor did not appear on camera, and only repeatedly posted two messages in the comment area: &quot;Write the address as you like, the merchant will change the address and send it to us.&quot; &quot;Thank you all the kind people for caring about the furry children, dog food.&quot; It is sent to the base, just write the address as you like, and the merchant will send it to the base.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On short video platforms, such stray dog ​​live broadcast rooms are not uncommon. Southern Weekend reporters randomly entered several live broadcast rooms and found that the number of viewers ranged from single digits to thousands. The largest room had about 3,500 people watching at the same time. The live broadcast had received 194,000 likes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But not all stray dog ​​live broadcast rooms are authentic and trustworthy. At the beginning of November, some netizens posted a message to remind everyone not to be deceived by such live broadcast rooms. A netizen said that after placing an order for dog food during a stray dog ​​rescue live broadcast, he asked the host to touch a certain puppy in the camera, and was immediately blocked. This online post was on the hot list of social platforms and attracted a lot of attention. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In several stray dog ​​live broadcast rooms, Southern Weekend reporters tried to leave messages, asking how to ensure the delivery of dog food, the specific address of the base, whether the details would be made public, etc. The questions were either ignored or received vague answers. . One anchor replied that the location of the base is &quot;Huanyang Village, Sheyang County&quot;, but after further questioning about the specific address, the anchor stopped responding. After raising several questions in succession, Southern Weekend&#39;s reporter was blocked from the live broadcast room. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Subsequently, Southern Weekend reporters contacted the neighborhood committee where the anchor claimed the address. The staff said that the so-called Huanyang Village does not exist now and has been merged. After being visited by the grid staff, the staff member confirmed to Southern Weekend reporter, &quot;We do not have a stray dog ​​rescue center here. We do not have a so-called base here.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to doubts about the authenticity of the rescue station, there are also people who smell more business opportunities besides live broadcast. A large number of teaching articles have appeared on the Internet, and training groups have been organized, claiming to teach people to create stray dog ​​live broadcasts and &quot;earned 8 million yuan a year.&quot; Southern Weekend reporters found a teacher who claimed to reward more than 100,000 yuan a day and asked about the operating costs. The other person replied, &quot;It mainly depends on the scene, (including) dogs, food, rent, water and electricity.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The teacher also reminded and suggested: &quot;Now the popularity of this gameplay has passed. It used to have a lot of traffic, but now the live broadcast room is not easy to start streaming. I don&#39;t recommend you to play this again. Something.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;img alt=&quot;Most of the time, the stray dogs in the live broadcast room sleep crowded together without barking or making trouble. In animal rescue agencies According to the person in charge, Chen Qiang, it is unreasonable for dogs to remain in such a state for a long time in a dense space. (Screenshot by Southern Weekend reporter Weng Rongrong)&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/ 23/12/06/6660de4856.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;2228&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/06/ 6660de4856.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;260885&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: left;&quot;>;The stray dogs in the live broadcast room sleep together most of the time. Barking or not, according to Chen Qiang, the person in charge of the animal rescue organization, it is unreasonable for dogs to remain in this state for a long time in a dense space. (Screenshot of Southern Weekend reporter Weng Rongrong)&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The end of poor sales is to bring goods&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Starting in 2022, Xin Chaochao often visits the stray dog ​​live broadcast room. In the footage, most of the stray dogs are crowded In a small room, looking listless. Some dogs had signs hanging on them, saying things like &quot;Please feed&quot; and &quot;We&#39;ve been hungry for a long time.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Most of the live broadcast content is monotonous, and the specific conditions of the dogs are not introduced, but they are repeatedly sold miserably. Xin Chaochao felt sorry for these thin stray dogs and placed an order for dog food according to the anchor&#39;s prompts without hesitation. A serving of dog food costs about ten yuan, which is not high. She buys two or three servings at a time as a small act of kindness. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Later, Xin Chaochao went to an offline stray dog ​​rescue base. She found that the staff knew the life experience of each dog very well, and most of the dogs were very energetic, which was completely different from those in the live broadcast room. She tried to leave comments in the live broadcast room, asking the anchor whether she could adopt or volunteer, but these comments were always ignored by the anchor. She realized something was wrong. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Xue was once blocked by a stray dog ​​live broadcast room. She now volunteers at an offline stray dog ​​base. At that time, she had insomnia at night, so she would open the live broadcast room and watch the puppy sleep for a while. After watching more, she found that although many live broadcast accounts were displayed in different cities, the layout, decoration, dog status, etc. of the room were almost identical. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Once, she saw a live broadcast room showing a stray dog ​​in the same city as herself, so she left a message in the live broadcast room, saying that she had rescue experience and asked if she could go and help. The anchor has repeatedly emphasized that he is short of food and people. Li Xue left several messages, but the anchor did not respond and later blocked her. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Guangzhou Apai Caring for Small Animals Social Development Center has been established for seven years and specializes in stray animal rescue. The person in charge, Chen Qiang, has also seen similar live broadcasts of stray dogs. In her experience, real animal rescues will let the animals out to walk around and bask in the sun, but the dogs in the live broadcast room are usually just sleeping. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She believes that if the density of animals is too high, it will be difficult to sleep peacefully for a long time, and dogs have territorial and spatial awareness, and too much concentration can easily lead to biting. &quot;In a crowded space, more than 20 animals are sleeping together, as if they are in love with each other, which is contrary to our understanding.&quot; Chen Qiang told Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for the operation of asking viewers to buy dog ​​food and send it to the base, Chen Qiang thinks it is also very suspicious. The goods taken may not actually be sent, and the transaction does not really happen. &quot;We don&#39;t know. All I know is that the money has been paid.” Li Xue also believes that &quot;it&#39;s just a name, I don&#39;t know whether it will be shipped or not.&quot; She also observed that some new live broadcast rooms do not put out shopping links as soon as they are launched, but &quot;pretend to have no desires and desires for two days&quot; before starting to bring goods. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to dog food, these stray dog ​​live broadcast accounts will also sell pet products or common daily necessities, guiding viewers to click on links to purchase. Chen Qiang found that the origin of many products was unknown. “We cannot see where the products come from or whether they have been to the brand or factory for evaluation.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporter clicked on a purchase link. The product name is &quot;Rescue Station (Specialized Whole Dog Food)&quot;. There are eight specifications to choose from. The price ranges from 30 yuan to 1,000 yuan. It has been sold. 93 pieces. But looking at the store where the link is located, the business license shows that the operator is a stationery store, an individual industrial and commercial owner, and the registration date is 2020. The store has four types of dog food on sale. The link with the highest sales was put on the shelves on October 20, and 383 copies have been sold. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The store’s customer service told the Southern Weekend reporter that the dog food was produced in the warehouse and sent directly to the base, and then the Southern Weekend reporter was blacklisted. The other two dog food stores said they have cooperation with anchors, who promote the manufacturers or receive commissions for bringing goods. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;img alt=&quot;Window shopping link of a stray dog ​​live broadcast account.

(Screenshot by Southern Weekend reporter Weng Rongrong)&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Self-written and self-directed rescue script&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In addition to live broadcasts, such accounts will also shoot videos of rescuing stray dogs. Li Xue once watched a rescue video. The anchor claimed to have rescued an injured puppy. It was so seriously injured that its bones were even exposed. Every once in a while, the anchor will update its recovery status. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Xue sent the video to her rescue group, and a veterinarian told her that based on the tragic situation in the video, it would be impossible to return to the current state unless it was a medical miracle. Li Xue guessed that the owner of the account might be the dog abuser himself. He was directing and acting, and the video was actually a flashback update. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Xue once saw an anchor filming at a dog meat stall, claiming to have bought the dogs and calling on everyone to donate. She thought this was counterintuitive, &quot;As an animal rescuer, going to a place where dogs are slaughtered to take pictures is something you wouldn&#39;t do under normal circumstances.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In January 2022, according to media reports, Ma Changchun, a stray dog ​​anchor in Xuyi County, Huai&#39;an City, Jiangsu Province, was suspected of stealing dogs and using stray dogs to live broadcast to defraud rewards. Data shows that he has more than 1.51 million fans, and his total live broadcast income in 180 days is as high as 16.228 million yuan. A fellow anchorman said that Ma Changchun once went to his base to buy a dog for live broadcast, and when the dog got sick, he sold it directly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Man Yun was one of the first bloggers to expose this matter, and had previously donated money to some live broadcast rooms. At that time, people on Douyin began to question Ma Changchun&#39;s fraud. The evidence cited included: the videos posted by his account were labeled &quot;meat dog breeding&quot;, and there were dog catching nets in his courtyard. Man Yun synthesized this information and posted it on his account. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Due to the large traffic on Manyun’s account, more and more netizens are approaching her to provide clues. Some people claimed that a stray dog ​​in Ma Changchun&#39;s live broadcast room was the dog he had lost before, but his comments and private message requests were ignored; netizens asked Ma Changchun if he sells dogs, and he once gave an affirmative answer; a caring person donated 250 kilograms of rice and 60 kilograms of salmon mince, but Ma still said that the dog was not full. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Afterwards, Man Yun and some caring people called the police. Afterwards, the local police said that they had conducted an on-site investigation and found that there was currently no problem with the source of the dog and that no relevant illegal activities had been found. Soon after, Ma Changchun’s account was banned and removed from the platform, and this millionaire anchor disappeared from the Internet world. Since then, the live broadcast of stray dogs whose authenticity is difficult to distinguish has planted doubts in people&#39;s minds. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A stray dog ​​live broadcast room teacher told Southern Weekend reporters that in order to create this type of account, first of all, &quot;there must be a place to raise dogs, dogs, and dog food.&quot; He concluded that it is very simple to find a venue. It can be an old factory building or a simple greenhouse. Dogs can be adopted or cheap dogs can be bought from the dog market. “You can also cooperate with other dog farms and find the ones that can attract audiences, such as Dogs can be cute, unique, and capable of fighting, or they can be pitiful and sympathetic.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He mentioned that if he wanted to appear miserable, &quot;unless (he) adopts a stray dog.&quot; He also suggested, &quot;There is no need to have so many stray dogs at once. If you have a few stray dogs, give each one a name and have its own characteristics and stories. Isn&#39;t it better than having more than seventy dogs?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt; p>; &quot;It is too easy to get such a bunch of dogs in this society.&quot; Xin Chaochao speculated that the dogs in some live broadcast rooms may be &quot;dogs that people in the countryside do not want, or are stolen, or Dogs that are sold at low prices in breeding farms, or from the pet market.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;While doing volunteer activities at the rescue base, Li Xue learned that some stray dog ​​live broadcast rooms did not have their own dog farms, but rented them temporarily. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;span>;&lt;strong>;Is there support for offline adoption and rescue, and is there any follow-up? &lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Apai Care Small Animal Social Development Center currently has about 80 animals, almost all of which were rescued by caring people who notified the center after encountering them by chance. Chen Qiang told a reporter from Southern Weekend that at most, he would receive 70 or 80 stray animal rescue messages a day, and “sometimes it’s impossible to save them at all.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Most of the stray animals are seriously injured and sick. In addition to treatment, the center also bathes and deworms the animals regularly, so that they can be adopted smoothly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Any base that really helps stray animals is willing to adopt the animals, because only in this way can more resources be freed up to receive new animals.” According to Chen Qiang’s observation, many stray dog ​​live broadcast rooms do not They will respond positively to the audience&#39;s desire to adopt, and will not let anyone know its detailed address and go on-site inspection. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporters found that although some stray dog ​​live broadcast rooms claim to allow adoption on their homepages, the conditions are tied to money. For example, a live broadcast room claims to have more than 100 dogs. As long as you insist on &quot;cloud raising&quot; in the live broadcast room for three months, you can adopt one and take it home. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The so-called &quot;cloud feeding&quot; means &quot;adding meat to their daily meals&quot;, that is, donations. The anchor said, &quot;If you can&#39;t stick to them for three months, don&#39;t tell me how much you like them. Even if you take them back, you may not be able to live better than me.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Chen Qiang believes that Yunyang sounds &quot;like a bundled sale.&quot; The person in charge of another animal rescue center in Guangzhou told Southern Weekend reporters that in general animal adoption, the adopter&#39;s concept of pet care and sense of responsibility are valued, and they can have a general understanding during the communication process. After the animal is adopted, they will do some return visits in the first two years to understand the animal&#39;s living conditions. If there are no problems, they will not disturb it again. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Li Xue’s view, whether to support offline public adoption is also one of the ways to distinguish between genuine and fake live broadcast rooms. If the other party is willing to disclose the address and accept adoption, it is best to go to the homepage to see if the other party has been selling the dog. &quot;Regular rescues want to adopt the dog out more, and they prefer to take photos of the lively and positive side of the dog.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At present, the monthly expenditure of Apai Care for Small Animals Social Development Center is 70,000 to 80,000 yuan. As a legally registered public welfare organization, 80% of their funding sources rely on public donations. One of the channels is to launch fundraising projects through public fundraising platforms. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporters found that many stray dog ​​live broadcast rooms also have public fundraising links. When you click on the link, the project information shows that it has been registered with the Civil Affairs Bureau, but the content introduction of the project does not match the situation mentioned in the live broadcast room. incompatible. In addition, Li Xue believes that whether there is a follow-up to the rescue is also one of the ways to identify it. Formal rescue will usually update the follow-up situation, including the details of the use of the money, and will also make it public. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;After all, it is something across the screen. Instead of distinguishing what is true and false on the Internet, it is better to understand the real things in the local area. What you can see is the real thing. No matter what you do on the Internet, Even if we try to identify it, we can&#39;t be 100% sure,&quot; Xin Chaochao told Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since the Ma Changchun incident, Man Yun has not watched the stray dog ​​live broadcast room for a long time. &quot;Because I was deceived, I am really sad. How can they take advantage of everyone like this? I no longer watch it.&quot; &quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Now, Manyun mainly rescues animals in real life and feeds stray animals when they encounter them. She rescued two stray dogs, which were eventually adopted by friends, and she also owns a stray dog ​​that a friend picked up. &quot;I feel like it&#39;s so tiring to distinguish this kind of thing, so just do it in reality. The things around you are more important and you can&#39;t see them online.&quot; Man Yun said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As the person in charge of a relief organization, Chen Qiang feels torn, “Sometimes I really hope to tell the public about things that are not really charity work, but sometimes I’m afraid that the public doesn’t have the ability to distinguish and will misunderstand many real ( (Rescue) organization. Anyway, I can’t tell the difference, so I just say you are all liars, which is really contradictory.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I am very helpless, there is no way, your kindness is probably the reason why they wander. &quot;Li Xue said, &quot;When there is no way to identify, it is already great to do a good job in helping people around you.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti; &quot;>;(At the request of the interviewees, Li Xue, Xin Chaochao and Man Yun are pseudonyms)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br >;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https:// feedx.run&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.run&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 06 Dec 2023 16:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[多地健康码重出江湖？相关部门有必要澄清以释众疑丨快评]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261962]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-12-06 15:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;Recently, there are media reports that health codes in some places have &quot;reappeared&quot; &quot;Jianghu&quot; has aroused strong public attention. Nowadays, &quot;Category B and B management&quot; have been implemented to deal with the new coronavirus, and many places have also announced that the health code system will be offline and relevant data will be destroyed. Why is the health code back on the scene? &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;Recently, respiratory infectious diseases have broken out again. At this time, the health code has returned to the world, which makes many people wonder. However, some netizens said that this is just because the health code system in some places has not been offline and has always been there. It is not that it has just &quot;reappeared&quot; recently, so there is no need to worry. In response to relevant questions, the official citizen hotline in some places stated that as long as it does not have an impact on life and travel, it is &quot;nothing&quot;, meaning that there is no need to worry about it &lt;span style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;>;, &quot;(epidemic) ) has passed.&quot;&lt;/span>;However, the health code is of great importance, and it is still necessary for relevant departments to provide further explanations to eliminate public doubts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;After the COVID-19 &quot;Category B and B&quot;, the future of the health code has aroused widespread discussion. Many places have announced that they will offline the health code system and delete the data. For example, on February 14, 2023, the relevant departments of a certain province issued an announcement announcing that from 11:00 on February 16, 2023, service entrances such as antigen self-testing, health declaration, digital space, and epidemic prevention workbench will be completely closed. Delete and destroy all data related to the service to ensure the security of personal information. Although the announcement at the time did not mention that the health code applet would be completely offline and all data deleted, the public generally believed that the health code had completed its historical mission and should completely withdraw from the historical stage and destroy all data behind the entire system. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;There is no doubt that the health code system stores a large amount of personal information. Information such as name, ID number, mobile phone number, and even face authentication are all extremely sensitive personal information. The health code system may also store travel information such as when and where each person has been, and medical and health information such as whether they have been vaccinated. This information is also personal privacy. During the epidemic, for the needs of prevention and control, the public can understand, accept and support. After the epidemic is over, the relevant systems have no reason to continue to save these users’ private data and should be destroyed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;At that time, Wang Chunhui, a member of the Information and Communication Economics Expert Committee of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology and director of the Network and Data Law Research Department of the Chinese Behavioral Law Society, also said in an interview with the media that itinerary cards, health codes The mission has ended, the purpose of processing personal information is no longer necessary, and all personal information should be deleted in accordance with the law. Many places have also announced that personal data in the health code system will be destroyed, and some cities have also held public destruction ceremonies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;However, judging from the current situation, there are still many places where the health code system seems to have not been offline, and some places still retain at least part of the data. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;Storing this data for a long time, even if the health code system is not completely offline, the risk of data leakage will increase dramatically. Because after the epidemic, the technical maintenance of the health code system has basically come to a standstill. If the data is not destroyed and the system is not offline and is exposed to the Internet, it is likely to be attacked by hackers. If the data is leaked, the consequences will be disastrous. Even when the health code system was still running, the information of 48.5 million users of a certain health code system was suspected to have appeared on the dark web for sale. Investigators checked 47 sets of data published by the sellers and found that the names, ID numbers, and mobile phone numbers of these users were all true, and they had indeed registered for the city&#39;s health code application. These leaked data will exist permanently on the dark web and will continue to be sold back and forth. The mobile phone number can be changed, but the name and ID number are used for a lifetime. You don’t know when this information may be used to commit telecom fraud. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;The health code system is independently developed by each locality, and each locality is responsible for the processing after deactivation. Some places have announced that they will stop services and destroy data, but judging from the current situation, some places have not actually done this. Of course, there are also health code applications in many places that have indeed stopped serving, and mini programs are no longer available. But users have no way of knowing whether the data behind it has been destroyed. It is necessary for an authoritative third party to supervise and verify the deactivation and data destruction of health code systems in various places to ensure that these data, which store a large amount of user sensitive information, are completely destroyed and will not be leaked or used without the user&#39;s knowledge. case for other purposes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;Whether the health code is &quot;reappearing&quot; or &quot;never offline&quot;, it shows that at least some data is still retained in some places. It is necessary for these places to issue official clarifications on this, and to take down the health code program under supervision as soon as possible and destroy the data to eliminate public doubts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 06 Dec 2023 15:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[“中印两国可以同时崛起”:访印度前驻华大使阿肖克·康特]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261956]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-12-06 14:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 06 Dec 2023 14:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[“没有中印参与，全球重大议题很难解决”：访印度前驻华大使]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261954]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-12-06 13:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;On the afternoon of December 3, Conte accepted a face-to-face interview with Southern Weekend reporters.

(Picture/Southern Weekend reporter Lu Huiqian)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;China and India are rising at the same time. How to handle Sino-Indian relations is not only related to the interests of the two countries, but also crucial to the entire world.&quot; December 3, 2023 On Japan, Ashok K. Kantha, former Indian Ambassador to China, said in an exclusive interview with a reporter from Southern Weekend on the sidelines of the 2023 &quot;Understanding China&quot; international conference. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Kant is a senior Indian diplomat and China expert. He served as the Consul General of India in Hong Kong, China, and as the Ambassador of India to China from 2014 to 2016. Currently, Conte works at the China Institute, an authoritative academic institution, which is located in New Delhi, the capital of India. It is the oldest institution on China issues in India. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I have worked in China and been engaged in China research for 15 years. I can only say that I have a certain understanding of China. China is very big and complex. No one dares to say that they fully understand China.&quot; Conte said with a smile. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As the Indian ambassador to China, Kant has witnessed the good development of Sino-Indian relations. During his tenure, the heads of state of China and India visited each other&#39;s hometowns. But he admitted frankly that &quot;the current Sino-Indian relations need to resolve some outstanding issues and pass them smoothly.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;There are many similarities between China and India.&quot; Conte said that historically, the two countries used to be the world&#39;s largest economies, but subsequently lagged behind world development. Now China and India are re-emerging. , &quot;Both sides should support each other.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Seeing China from Two Perspectives&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong style=&quot;color: #9a0000;&quot;>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;First time participating in &quot;Understanding China&quot; How do you feel about international conferences? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Conte: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;For me, this is a good opportunity to try to understand China’s views on various issues. Especially how China tells its story to the outside world. This morning, I attended a closed-door seminar on Sino-US relations. Participants from China, the United States, South Korea and India had a long discussion, and I was also one of the speakers. This discussion was very fruitful and can help us understand a very critical issue - how the future development trajectory of Sino-US relations will affect the entire world. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong style=&quot;color: #9a0000;&quot;>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;What suggestions do you have for promoting mutual understanding between China and India? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Conte:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;China has a long civilization and is also the world&#39;s second largest economy and the most important trading partner of nearly 40 countries around the world. There is no doubt that issues involving China will arouse the attention of other countries, including India, and some of China&#39;s measures will also cause concerns in other countries, so it is very important to understand China&#39;s ambitions and how China develops. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, China is India&#39;s largest neighbor, and India also hopes to maintain friendly relations with China. However, currently, relations between the two countries are in a difficult period due to border issues. If the boundary issue cannot be normalized, it will be difficult for the overall relations between China and India to return to normal. Against this backdrop, we hope to be able to communicate our concerns and expectations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong style=&quot;color: #9a0000;&quot;>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;You have served as India’s ambassador to China before. What new feelings do you have when you return to China this time? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Conte: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I have worked in China for a long time. The first time I came to China was in 1981, when I was a young diplomat. Later, I served as the Consul General of India in Hong Kong, China and the Ambassador of India to China. But at that time, I was working in China as a diplomat. Today, as an ordinary Indian citizen studying China issues, I went to China to participate in a conference and tried to understand China. These are two different perspectives. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;China-India relations are very important. It is a complex relationship with challenges, but we hope to have constructive engagement with China. In the early years, I was working in China on behalf of India. My perspective on the problem and my specific working methods were all different. As an ordinary citizen, I can promote mutual understanding between China and India in my own way. In particular, I have many old friends in China. We can talk openly and honestly. I will tell them what concerns India has and what changes it expects China to make. The dialogue between us is very friendly and candid. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;The most populous&quot; has mixed blessings&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong style=&quot;color: #9a0000;&quot;>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;In 2023, India will surpass China and become the The most populous country in the world, what does this mean for India? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Conte: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I don’t think it made a big difference. India and China are the two most populous countries in the world, with about 1.4 billion people each. For India, we need to take greater responsibility to look after such a huge population to ensure that the country continues to develop. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Historically, India and China were once the largest economies in the world. Research by Angus Maddison, a well-known British economist, pointed out that in the 17th and 18th centuries, the economies of China and India were leading the world, but later India encountered colonial rule and lost development opportunities, and its economic growth continued to slow down. Slowly, GDP dropped from about 25% of the world at that time to 4% in 1950. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Now, we are working hard to rebuild our country and our economy. India has been doing very well over the past three decades, with economic growth rate second only to China. But we also face huge challenges in many areas, especially in providing a better life for our people and in technological development and transformation. China and India are very similar and we can learn from each other&#39;s experiences. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong style=&quot;color: #9a0000;&quot;>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;What opportunities and challenges will becoming the world&#39;s most populous country bring to India? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Conte:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;One of India’s great advantages is that it has a very young population. The median age of the population in India is about 28 years old, and that&#39;s the demographic dividend we have. A larger youth population means more people to serve in the Indian economy. We must make full use of this dividend and think about how to enable this young working population to contribute to India&#39;s achievement of becoming a developed economy. India&#39;s goal is to become a developed country by 2047, the 100th anniversary of India&#39;s independence. Although this task is difficult, India is working towards this goal. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, India provides jobs for nearly 12 million new workers every year, which is a huge number. Similar to China, India is also facing the problem of youth unemployment or underemployment, so we must create new job opportunities on a large scale. But this goal can only be achieved by ensuring that the economy continues to grow at a rate of 7% or 8%. It&#39;s a big challenge, but one we can meet. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;Without the participation of China and India, it is difficult to solve major global issues&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong style=&quot;color: #9a0000;&quot;>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;As China&#39;s largest neighbor and a member of the BRICS, how does India view its relationship with China? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Conte:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;India and China have a complex relationship with many unresolved issues, including border disputes. Both China and India are trying to establish a constructive and friendly partnership. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Now, the situation on the Sino-Indian border is not stable. If the border issue is not resolved, it will be difficult for the overall relations between the two countries to return to normal. Therefore, the direct challenge we face is how to restore peace and tranquility on the border. Now, China and India have made some progress, but there is still a lot of work to be done. We need to have closer and more strategic dialogue so that bilateral issues can be effectively resolved, so as to contribute to the two countries&#39; efforts in regional and global issues. to create conditions for joint cooperation. China and India are the two most populous countries in the world and rank among the world&#39;s five largest economies. Without the participation of China and India, major global issues such as climate change, terrorism and artificial intelligence will be difficult to fully resolve. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong style=&quot;color: #9a0000;&quot;>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;As the two largest developing countries in the world, how can the two sides enhance mutual trust and cooperation? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Conte:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;China and India have maintained good cooperation in many fields in the past, and China is India&#39;s second largest trading partner. In 2022, bilateral trade between China and India will be close to US$135 billion. But India is also worried. India&#39;s trade deficit with China exceeds 100 billion US dollars. India looks forward to pursuing a more balanced economic engagement with China, but we also need to respect each other&#39;s concerns, interests and ambitions. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Now China and India are rising at the same time and becoming two major countries in the world. In this process, how to handle Sino-Indian relations is not only related to the interests of the two countries, but also to the entire world. Crucial. China and India can rise at the same time, and both sides should support each other. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;India will not join any military alliance&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong style=&quot;color: #9a0000;&quot;>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;For a long time, India has Diplomatically, India pursues a policy of non-alignment, but in recent years, India seems to be turning to the United States and strengthening military cooperation with Japan. What do you think of this trend? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Conte:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;India seeks to have good relations with all major countries in the world, whether it is the United States, China, Russia, Japan and European countries. However, we will maintain an independent foreign policy and make decisions based on specific issues without joining any military alliance. This basic national policy has not changed. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is no doubt that the relationship between India and the United States has changed, especially in the past 20 years. The United States has become India&#39;s largest trading partner. We cooperate with the United States, Western countries and Japan because we believe this is very important for India&#39;s economic and technological transformation. In fact, China is also working closely with these countries. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;India seeks to establish closer ties with the United States and is also strengthening security cooperation under the &quot;Quadrilateral Mechanism&quot;. But what needs to be made clear is that the &quot;Quadrilateral Security Dialogue&quot; between the United States, Japan, India, and Australia is not a military mechanism, and India is not willing to join any alliance. We just want to maintain our strategic independence. India&#39;s stance on the Russia-Ukraine conflict illustrates all this. We have adopted a stance that is completely different from that of the United States and Western countries. India will maintain an independent foreign policy on all issues. On some issues, we will cooperate with the United States and Japan, but on some issues, we may also have differences with them. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong style=&quot;color: #9a0000;&quot;>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;What factors will India pay attention to? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Conte:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;India does not want to see any confrontation and armed conflict between China and the United States, because this will have a negative impact on global development . &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In November 2023, the heads of state of China and the United States will meet in San Francisco, which will help restore Sino-US relations to a certain extent. India welcomes such changes and looks forward to seeing the world’s most Two powerful countries re-establish a more stable relationship. However, the strategic competition between China and the United States still faces potential structural challenges, and it is still unclear how the relationship between the two parties will evolve. We hope that China and the United States will avoid conflict, because this is not in the interest of both parties, nor is it in the interest of other countries, including India. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 06 Dec 2023 13:25:05 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[面对民主制度的退潮，查尔斯·泰勒开出了这样的药方]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261938]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-12-06 12:02:30&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 12/05/ibDnm46IXLOJQYg6c9u3Z3FsQhTaeL8ipzgyGOqz.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;726&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/05/ibDnm46IXLOJQYg6c9u3Z3FsQhTaeL8ipz gyGOqz. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;260822&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Canadian philosopher Charles Taylor and his new book &quot;The Decline of Democracy&quot; (with Craig Calhoun, Dilip Parameshwar Gaonkar). &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(data map/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since the end of the last century, the trends of neoliberalism, globalization and democratization have swept the world, as if the entire There is only one way, one path in the world. But twenty or thirty years later, since Brexit, Trump’s rise to power, and right-wing parties winning elections around the world, political scientists are talking about the decline of democracy, both trying to explain why (as Fukuyama puts it in his book Identity Politics) Identity analyzes how disadvantaged communities thrive), while also continuing to defend democracy (e.g. Przewski&#39;s Why Bother with Elections?). Canadian philosopher Charles Taylor also co-authored a new book with two scholars, &quot;Degenerations of Democracy&quot; (Harvard University Press, 2022), which adds to the literature that has emerged in recent years on the decline of democracy. , adding another important book. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before talking about the new book, let me first explain the background. Taylor wrote a masterpiece, &quot;A Secular Age&quot;, analyzing how the Western world evolved from the medieval era when &quot;no god was necessary&quot; to a secular era where God was &quot;all-powerful&quot;. The world experienced a helpless time. The historical process of looking back. Recognizing that history moves forward (rather than repeating ebbs and flows) is equally important to understanding the decline of democracy today. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Just as in the new book, the authors led by Taylor describe today&#39;s democracy as a &quot;degenerate&quot; rather than a &quot;retreat&quot;. To clarify the difference between the two words, the point I want to explain is that With the qualitative change of the democratic system, it will no longer be able to return to &quot;normal&quot; as before. It will not be regarded as the &quot;golden rule&quot; as before (that is, democratic countries have a transcendent status but non-democratic countries are eager to imitate it). The kind of system that was once The &quot;good days of democracy&quot; that briefly appeared are long gone from a global perspective. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another focus of the author in &quot;The Decline of Democracy&quot; is to define democracy as a telic concept. In other words: democracy is an ideal situation, but the world can never be so ideally democratic (It is defined by standards that can never be met). To move towards democracy, elections are certainly one of the keys, but the presence of elections certainly does not mean democracy (just like the lack of rotation of political parties in Japan does not mean the lack of local democracy), democratic elections must have the two qualities of &quot;free&quot; and &quot;fair&quot; Big conditions. In reality, there is never true and ultimate freedom and fairness, but there is often the possibility of being a little freer and a little fairer. Similarly, the author regards democracy as a goal in the book, either getting closer to democracy or moving further and further away. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Like other scholars of democratic theory, Taylor and other authors in &quot;The Decline of Democracy&quot; also hope to explain why the current world is contrary to democracy, and their answer is that the public has lost a kind of will that will change tomorrow. People feel they are deprived of the ability to make good lives for themselves and their families, so the public no longer has clear ideological preferences as before, but it is easier to resort to emotions and vent their dissatisfaction in life. Complaining collectively in small groups has become the greatest comfort in life. This is called populism. It is against this background that the democratic system has gradually changed from the past where everyone competed to pursue their own interests (agonistic), into an antagonistic arena. This is what the author calls the decline of democracy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If you want to ask how a democratic system can be brought back to life, the key must be to analyze the cause of death. The fundamental reason for the decline of the democratic system is the loss of the people&#39;s trust. If no one trusts any system, politics and political-related figures will only be hated by gods and ghosts. The author believes that ideal democracy is practiced through representative politics, that is, the people vote for political parties and authorize the formation of the government. The government is elected by one person and one vote. Everyone has a &quot;share&quot;, and the government therefore needs to be accountable to the people. However, scholars such as Charles Taylor revealed the miserable situation of democracy in the real world in &quot;The Decline of Democracy&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In political research, the decline of the democratic system and the people&#39;s indifference or even disgust with politics are not something that has just happened in the past few years. It is only the situation that has taken a turn for the worse in recent years that has attracted more attention. The situation is exactly like global warming. It has been talked about for decades, but in recent years it has really started to feel like it has burned its heels. So now more people are coming out to speak out for the earth, but we know that the distance problem will be alleviated (let alone solved). The volume is still far from enough. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The same goes for democratic systems. The voting rates in old Western democracies have been low for decades, and political party support has also been deteriorating. Behind these things is that the democratic system and the people are getting further and further apart. The death of democracy will have as much impact on the world as global warming. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In &quot;The Decline of Democracy&quot;, the three authors describe the failed democratic system in reality: social inequality is infinitely magnified through the democratic system, and power and wealth are concentrated in a very small number of people. Regularly held elections and the political parties participating in them are to blame. The political parties themselves enjoy it, but (most) people don&#39;t actually feel it. Social development has become more diverse, but representative political parties have been unable to keep up. The opposition between left and right has left the people feeling indifferent. Political parties no longer represent the people, and a sense of powerlessness has enveloped the public. This is the key point that the author emphasizes repeatedly in the book: the people have lost their sense of accomplishment (efficacy). Who wants to get involved in politics when the “sacred vote” is effectively optional? The people&#39;s inefficacy is both the cause and the result of the decline of the democratic system. All problems are intertwined and form a vicious cycle. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When the system is incompetent and useless, populism, which allows people to share the same hatred and hatred, becomes extremely attractive. However, the author emphasizes very much in the book: populism is not the cause of the decline of democratic systems. Populism does indeed grow stronger when the democratic system is at its most fragile, but don’t forget that populism originally relied on the democratic system and mass mobilization. Forcibly treating populism as the biggest enemy actually ignores the root of the problem. If the democratic system is to be revived and active again, the most important thing to do is to re-inject a sense of achievement into the people and make them believe that the vote in their hands is not a piece of waste paper, but that they can really make a difference because of their vote. And elect a government that is responsible for itself and the country, but how to do it and is it possible? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In their book &quot;The Decline of Democracy&quot;, Taylor and others wrote that the democratic system was beyond recovery, but the great philosophers did not just end it irresponsibly. Before they concluded, they wrote that it might be The most important chapter of the book, &quot;What to do?&quot; attempts to propose four life-saving methods for the declining democratic system. I will briefly summarize them here. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The primary method is to restart democracy (Renew the Democratic Project). To put it simply and concisely, it is to re-respect the people of every country, because as mentioned before, one of the main reasons for the decline of democracy is that the people feel powerless and angry. For democracy to become an effective system, it must first make the people believe that they are part of the country again. That is to say, everyone&#39;s social background, blood culture, ideology and beliefs can be different, but the premise is that everyone should have the most basic and important thing in common - national identity, and use this identity to identify and transcend. and accommodate their differences. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, it is extremely difficult to achieve mutual respect between people. If you look at the long-standing card of &quot;immigration&quot; in Western countries, you will know how divided and exclusionary the reality is. But the author said that the connection between people can be achieved in many ways, and uniting the masses with emotions like populism is one of the ways; similarly, returning to the community and starting to cultivate people&#39;s sense of belonging in the community can also be used to unite the people with emotions. People unite. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The second way to save democracy is to Overcome Neoliberal Bias against the Public Good. Under marketism, public expenditures have been continuously reduced in recent decades. When the world is at peace, the world is at peace. But when a crisis occurs, public institutions can respond immediately to whatever extent they can withstand it, at the cost of countless lives. Adequate and effective public expenditure is also an important source of people&#39;s sense of belonging to the country. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The last two methods: Think Big and It Takes a Movement. Before establishing something, we must first break it. Since the democratic system is now outdated and ineffective, more powerful reforms are needed. After reading this, the biggest revelation for readers may not be that democracy can be saved, but that the problem of democratic decline is so serious that it is almost impossible to save, because all the methods mentioned by the author are far from reality. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Due to work needs, I recently stayed in Belgium and visited the European Parliament a few days ago. I talked about how the EU&#39;s democratic system is innovative, how to value the opinions of people of all countries, and how to embody the practice of democracy. But the reality is that Belgium is like other European and American cities: there are many homeless people on the streets, and there are people (and more than one) begging on every subway ride. I tried two rides back and forth on the same day, and I met the same person. A beggar is really destined, and I lament that my fate in Belgium actually fell on a beggar...&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What should I do? If you ignore various social problems, you will naturally not be able to gain the trust of the people. So is this book &quot;The Decline of Democracy&quot; worthless and just to release emotions? Not really. Do you remember the key point mentioned at the beginning of the book? Democracy is a &quot;telic concept&quot;. The ultimate democracy is just a goal. The people can always look at the benchmark and run straight. Even if we can never reach the benchmark, we can still get closer to the benchmark. distance between. Human beings grow old, sick and die, and governments and regimes come and go. If we can walk in the direction of democracy and freedom and try our best to bring the goal closer instead of farther away, even if it is only a small amount, it is considered progress. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.run&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. run&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 06 Dec 2023 12:25:19 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[“脱钩是一种‘双输’战略”：专访奥地利前总理沃尔夫冈·许塞尔]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261950]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-12-06 10:35:46&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&quot;I need a cup of coffee.&quot; At noon on December 3, 2023, before the official interview began, Xussel Again, stress this to your assistant. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From December 1st to 3rd, 78-year-old former Austrian Chancellor Wolfgang Schüssel spent three busy days in Guangzhou. Opening speeches, media meetings, parallel forum speeches... his schedule is filled with &quot;brain activities&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is his first time to participate in the &quot;Understanding China&quot; international conference. &quot;This is an open discussion, very interesting and exciting.&quot; Xussel told Southern Weekend reporters, and &quot;people read and wrote &quot;Good speech&quot; is different. This is a conversation with controversy, &quot;both positive and negative, and people express their own opinions.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;There are representatives from different countries here. Whether they are Europeans, Americans, or Chinese, everyone can participate. This makes it possible for people to reflect on their existing positions, understand new ideas, and gain enlightenment.&quot; Xu Sai I said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past 40 years, Xussel has visited China more than ten times and witnessed China&#39;s &quot;incredible development.&quot; Xussel is friendly to China and values ​​relations with China. During his term as prime minister from 2002 to 2007, the trade volume between China and Austria doubled several times. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In recent years, against the background of tense Sino-US relations, voices such as &quot;decoupling theory&quot; and &quot;deglobalization&quot; have become increasingly popular, casting a shadow on China-EU cooperation. Schüssel said he was &quot;totally opposed to decoupling&quot; because it was globalization and international trade that brought affluence and prosperity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Globalization is good for China, good for Europe, good for the United States, and good for those less developed countries. And decoupling is a &#39;lose-lose&#39; strategy.&quot; He said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;At noon on December 3, Wolfgang Schüssel accepted a face-to-face interview with Southern Weekend reporters.

(Photo/Southern Weekend reporter Lu Huiqian)&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“China is a special model”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong style=&quot;color: #9a0000;&quot;>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>; &lt;span>;What do you think is the difference between China&#39;s development model and that of the West? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Wolfgang Schüssel:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;China is certainly a special model. In the past, China did not have free movement, free enterprise, private ownership and private property, but today the situation is completely different and China is developing in a positive direction. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This combination is very interesting. Usually we believe that market economy, free enterprise, private companies, etc., are complementary to freedom, openness, and pluralistic democracy. China, on the other hand, shows a different model. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Moreover, the Communist Party has a certain dynamic, an elitist management approach. They take the best and most talented people and then put those people to the test. If these people are successful, then they will be assigned to different positions again and then enter the next stage. This is a very interesting model. It&#39;s not our model, but it&#39;s a very effective model. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong style=&quot;color: #9a0000;&quot;>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;How does Europe view the rise of China? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Wolfgang Schüssel:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Generally speaking, the European people respect China’s peaceful rise very much. I am an economist. I remember when Deng Xiaoping came to power, China&#39;s GDP was less than 200 billion US dollars. Today, that number is $7 trillion. This is incredible growth. China has lifted hundreds of millions of people out of poverty, and their living conditions have now greatly improved. The “One Belt, One Road” initiative proposed by China is also playing an important role. So I think China plays an important role on the international stage and has huge influence. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We have great respect and admiration for the Chinese model. Of course, we have different views on our respective political systems, that&#39;s for sure. But no matter what, every country has the right to choose its own future, and China does not belong to Europe. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong style=&quot;color: #9a0000;&quot;>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;In recent times, Europe’s voice on China has not been positive. What is the reason behind this? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Wolfgang Schüssel:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;In the Russia-Ukraine conflict, one million people have been killed or disabled in the past two years. Mostly young people. Every day, missiles and drones rain down on Ukraine, destroying infrastructure, homes, and apartments. Today, the area where the battle was fought looks like the moon, a no-man&#39;s land. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So, I think both Europe and China should use their influence to stop this war and respect the sovereignty of independent countries. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;Decoupling&quot; is a &quot;lose-lose&quot; strategy&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong style=&quot;color: #9a0000;&quot;>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;What do you think? &quot;Decoupling theory&quot;? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Wolfgang Schüssel:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I am completely opposed to decoupling. it&#39;s out of the question. It is globalization and international trade that bring affluence and prosperity. According to customs figures, global trade has exploded over time. Globalization is good for China, good for Europe, good for the United States, and good for those less developed countries. So (decoupling) is absolutely impossible. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some research suggests that when decoupling actually occurs, it will cause a loss of more than 7% of global GDP. For countries that are more deeply integrated into global supply chains, decoupling will do more harm. Like China or Austria, Europe and the United States. Therefore, decoupling is really a “lose-lose” strategy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong style=&quot;color: #9a0000;&quot;>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Are de-risking and decoupling the same? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Wolfgang Schüssel: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;De-risking is different. I know some people suggest that these two statements are consistent, but in fact they are not the same. De-risking refers to the reluctance of people to rely heavily on a single partner. Take the COVID-19 pandemic, for example. Suddenly, we saw a shortage of medical equipment. Moreover, due to the trade blockade, all channels have been closed. We have no medicines from India and no masks from China. De-risking means you have to leave some protection areas in place to protect your people, just in case. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As another example, in terms of energy, we cannot completely rely on Russia. We have to diversify our sources. If someone blew up the pipeline in Austria, or Ukraine or Russia stopped the Nord Stream 1 pipeline, everything would be ruined. No energy, no electricity, you can imagine what that means for the economy. So, you have to diversify. China is also de-risking. China needs to maintain sovereignty in data, supply chains, etc. This is completely understandable, and we will do the same. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another example is national defense. The Europeans have outsourced national defense to the Americans. Trump said that we will eventually leave NATO and Europe will be responsible for itself. This is what de-risking means. We have to invest more in our own defense because in a crisis you have to protect your own people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What should you do if you suddenly encounter cyber hackers, surprise attacks, or blockades? What about your government, your site, your hospital, your energy company? Just like a company, we analyze potential risks in all directions of the company from a professional perspective - including paying attention to usage context, technical risks, external risks, market risks, etc. Every company will protect itself from risks, and the government must do the same . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong style=&quot;color: #9a0000;&quot;>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;In recent years, China has emphasized high-level opening up. What opportunities do you think this will bring? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Wolfgang Schüssel:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I think China’s opening up to the outside world is very important. Two factors struck me during the discussions at this conference. The first one is that a Chinese friend suggested that China is now focusing on developing a unified domestic market, such as managing the financial market, allocation, lending standards, etc. in all provinces with the same rules. This is exactly what the EU has always wanted to do but has not quite done yet. And once we complete that, it will be a huge catalyst for new growth. So, China is also following the same path. If China provides a large-scale market for its consumers and industrial partners, this is a major benefit for all of us. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The second point is that China is now committed to developing regional trade with ASEAN countries, which will also help Europe. Because I know that many companies in Europe are also interested in establishing ties with ASEAN countries. In many cases, people cannot accurately tell where a product comes from. For example, if you look at my smartphone, it contains 700-800 different components. They may be from Vietnam, Thailand, China, the United States, etc. As another example, my Audi car is made up of 900 different parts. It&#39;s assembled in Mexico, its engine comes from Slovakia, the gasoline comes from Hungary, parts come from China, and some elements come from Germany. So, this isn&#39;t just a &quot;German car&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So I think this kind of inter-regional cooperation is beneficial. Moreover, cooperation enhances neighborly relations. For example, the EU intends to integrate the Western Balkan countries into the EU. Thirty years ago, a bloody war broke out in the Balkans. If Serbia develops cooperative trade with Croatia, Slovenia, etc., it will &quot;force&quot; peace. Therefore, I believe that inter-regional cooperation is conducive to prosperity, conducive to peace, and conducive to a harmonious future. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“In short, we need to cooperate”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong style=&quot;color: #9a0000;&quot;>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;In 2020, Austria’s first trip from The China-Europe train from Vienna to Xi&#39;an sets off. How do you evaluate the impact of China-Europe freight trains on Austria? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Wolfgang Schüssel:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;China-Europe freight trains are very important. Shipping containers by rail is much faster and more environmentally friendly than shipping by sea. Although shipping is cheap, it does have more negative impacts in terms of environmental pollution and carbon dioxide emissions. So in my opinion, rail transportation is one of the elements of the future, which can both reduce costs and make cooperation more effective. Such applications have been very successful in Germany. If you look at the actual data, you will find that trade is growing positively, and it is not the so-called &quot;deglobalization&quot; or &quot;decoupling&quot; trend. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;What do you think of the changes in Sino-US relations? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Wolfgang Schüssel:&lt;/strong>;First of all, 80% of the world’s population is neither Chinese nor American. Therefore, I think Sino-US cooperation is not the only cooperation that both sides need. I think we should really work on promoting cooperation between Europe and China. Currently, we are looking for and working hard to develop together. By the way, same interests as China. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, a multipolar world requires well-functioning institutions, such as the United Nations and the World Trade Organization. This is important, if something goes wrong, arbitration is always better than bilateral tensions and that is in our interest. First, it is important to resume military engagement because no one wants to cause an accident, but it can happen. Likewise, what we need is a multipolar world, not a bipolar world. This could be beneficial to all of us if there were some effectively functioning international institutions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A few weeks ago, the heads of state of China and the United States met in San Francisco, and I felt very optimistic about it. This is a positive step towards cooperation. We should look forward to a positive and bright future, because the world needs such a future, and we are also facing common problems, such as climate change, financial problems, inflation, regional conflicts, etc. All in all, we need to work together. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong style=&quot;color: #9a0000;&quot;>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Do you think Austria or Europe will choose sides? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Wolfgang Schüssel: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;The boat will naturally go straight when it reaches the bridge. I trust the leaders on both sides, they are rational politicians. I believe that good political initiatives always have the welfare of the people at heart. And the happiness of the people means prosperity, it means peace, it means employment, it means a good position when competing with other countries - of course in a peaceful and economic way. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At this conference, we honor Henry Kissinger. He is one of the architects of such a good policy. He was born in Germany and was deported. (He) came to the United States as a refugee from Nazi Germany but became a historian and an advocate for peaceful cooperation. Not confrontation, but working together. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We also recently commemorated the late Premier of China, Li Keqiang. He founded the Forum Connecting Europe and China about 10 years ago to develop innovative worldviews and explore overall solutions to related problems. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I think they are our role models in how to deal with tough times. This is the challenge we see today, but we should not be pessimistic, we should make a positive future possible. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(Southern Weekend intern Zhang Xinyi also contributed to this article)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt; /p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 06 Dec 2023 10:55:03 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[聚焦丨2023年“读懂中国”国际会议（广州）]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261802]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-12-06 10:06:20&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>; From December 1st to 3rd, the 2023 &quot;Understanding China&quot; International Conference (Guangzhou) was held at Yuexiu International Convention Center , hundreds of domestic and foreign guests from more than 30 countries and regions exchanged and discussed.

In 1935, he was admitted to the History Department of Tsinghua University and was taught by professors such as Yu Pingbo, Chen Yinke, Qian Mu, and Jin Yuelin. In 1948, he went to study in the UK. In 1955, he was invited by the French sinologist Bai Lege to assist in the &quot;Song History Research Project&quot; and write &quot;The Births, Deaths and Chronology of Figures in the Song Dynasty&quot;. Since then, he has served as professor in the Chinese Department of Ruhr University Bonn in Germany, the Department of Oriental Languages ​​at the University of Wisconsin in the United States, the Nanyang University in Singapore, and the History Department at Soochow University in Taiwan. Published include &quot;Chinese Science and Technology History Series&quot;, &quot;Yilin Congkao&quot;, &quot;Siku Synopsis Supplement&quot;, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Mr. Weng Tongwen is an internationally renowned scholar of Chinese literature and history. His academic fields include not only the traditional four-part study, but also social history, literary history, and cultural history. He is well known to the world for his outstanding achievements and widespread influence in many fields, such as history of art, history of science and technology. I entered school late, and due to the cross-strait barrier, I didn’t get to know him, which I regret very much. Recently, a meeting was held in Taishun to commemorate Mr. Weng to discuss Mr. Weng&#39;s achievements. After a brief review of Professor Wu Songdi&#39;s two huge volumes of works, I can&#39;t help but admire him. What is particularly admirable is that Mr. Weng cared about his hometown in his later years and donated a lot of money. Later scholars in the country did not forget his kindness. They published anthologies and commemorated discussions, which are enough to make good stories. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Mr. Weng and I have not had the opportunity to ask for advice in person, and there are few points of intersection in our academic fields. I feel that Mr. Weng Tongwen’s nostalgia for boxing and his academic merits , I am also grateful for Professor Wu Songdi’s enthusiastic invitation, and the organizer of Taishun is motivated by the desire to advance and promote academics. However, I am occasionally troubled by trivial matters and am unable to advance. I would like to write down my rough experience after reading &quot;The Collected Works of Weng Tongwen&quot; . A little bit of petal incense is used to pay homage to the former philosopher. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;1. &quot;Supplement to the Siku Synopsis&quot;: traditional reading notes with high spirits&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Let me first talk about the philological research that I am more familiar with. , take the fifth volume of the anthology, &quot;Supplements to Siku Synopsis&quot; as an example. The eighty-eight articles in this part are written according to the traditional bibliographic and postscript method. Most of them are relatively simple and record the correction of errors found in &quot;Siku Synopsis&quot;. Some of them show the depth of effort. The first article examines the three volumes of Guo Zhongshu&#39;s &quot;Peijin&quot; in the early Song Dynasty. It discusses the summary and quotes Zhongshu&#39;s biography from &quot;History of the Song Dynasty&quot;. It is believed that the summary quoted is very different from the popular Baiji version and the palace version &quot;History of the Song Dynasty&quot;. It is speculated that the two There was originally a rift in the shogunate of Liu Yun, Duke of Xiangyin, and the target was misunderstood. Then based on the surviving documents of the Five Dynasties and the early Song Dynasty, Guo Zhongshu&#39;s life was restored, Daduan was restored, and he criticized Zhongshu for being a &quot;drinker and irresponsible person who had many disobediences with others&quot;. He also revealed what Wang Guowei had studied and later engraved the &quot;Nine Classics Characters&quot;. It was written by Zhongshu, and his contribution is indescribable. Today, people have a lot to say about the eight volumes of the four-storey version of &quot;The Biography of Talented Scholars of the Tang Dynasty&quot; written by Xin Wenfang of the Yuan Dynasty. Weng Kao has a particularly valuable historical material, that is, it is revealed that the second volume of &quot;Shitian Collection&quot; written by Ma Zuchang of the Yuan Dynasty contains &quot;Ti Xinliang Shi &quot;Pisha Collection&quot;&quot;: &quot;If you can&#39;t sort through the sand, there will be too much gold. The meaning of modern and ancient times is short and short. Long song. Autumn plugs sing frost armor, spring houses cut paintings, chanting turns the remaining hair, desolate is Yin He.&quot; Mr. Weng therefore knew Xin You&#39;s &quot;Collection of Poems on Peeling Sand&quot;, and commented: &quot;Yin He, Yin Keng, He Xun is also . Compared with this, it is profound, and there is no doubt that he is as famous as Wang Zhiqian and others, and Yang Zai and others advocated peace with them.&quot; &quot;>;(&quot;Collected Works&quot; mislabeled this passage as Ma Zu Changyu)&lt;/span>; This is very important for understanding the poetry level and achievements of Xin Wenfang himself, who worked most diligently on the poets of the Tang Dynasty in the Yuan Dynasty. A study of Zhang Tangying&#39;s &quot;Shu 梼杌&quot; in the Song Dynasty shows that the original book must have been in ten volumes. The whole article is only over 200 words long and contains extremely rich information, so you can rely on it for basic judgments. There are five volumes of &quot;Luoyang Jialan Ji&quot;, and the biographical annotations are all mixed into the main text. Since the Qing Dynasty, many scholars have hoped to separate out the annotations as Quanzu Wangxiao&#39;s &quot;Shui Jing Zhu&quot; did. Tang Yan&#39;s &quot;Gou Shen&quot;, recent scholars Fan Xiangyong&#39;s &quot;College Notes&quot;, Zhou Zumo&#39;s &quot;College Notes&quot; and Xu Gaoruan&#39;s &quot;Republication&quot; believe that Xu Shu &quot;learned from various schools and came from behind&quot;, but did not add annotations to historical events. In this regard, it is known that Fan and Zhoujia have &quot;profound skills&quot; and the attached pictures are &quot;sufficient for reference.&quot; This has gone far beyond the revision and supplement of &quot;Siku Synopsis&quot;. In five or six hundred words, one can read the gains and losses of modern people&#39;s governance of &quot;Jialan Ji&quot;. Since the publication of the abstract, Yu Jiaxi&#39;s &quot;Diagnosis of Syndrome&quot; has been particularly famous, and his scholarship has paid special attention to the collected works of the Song and Yuan Dynasties, which can supplement the author&#39;s actions and the beginning and end of the original book. Mr. Weng Tongwen also paid attention to the historical events between the Song and Yuan Dynasties. He discussed various articles with Yu, such as the life story of Ye Zhi, the author of &quot;Ai Rizhai Congchao&quot;, and the article in &quot;Xijing Miscellaneous Notes&quot; quoted Lao Gan and Hong Ye, The remaining books are unknown. Wang Chen was the author of &quot;Tang Yulin&quot;. There are many inventions in the remaining books. Mr. Weng Tongwen even read Su Shi&#39;s &quot;Wang Danian&#39;s Lament&quot; written for Chen&#39;s father. He also knew that Chen came from a maternal relative&#39;s house and was a cousin to Shen. , Chen is older than Shen. There are so many wonderful things like this that it is impossible to list them all. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img img-id=&quot;73967&quot; group-id=&quot;0&quot; asset-id=&quot;70758&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23 /12/05/101090ef9a.jpg&quot; img-title=&quot;WeChat picture_20231204163902.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;759&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm .com/cms/medias/image/23/12/05/101090ef9a.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;260816&quot; style=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center ;&quot;>;In 1936, Weng Tongwen (first from left) was with his family in Xi&#39;an. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;2. Research on Publishing History: China’s Contribution from a Western Academic Perspective&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; &quot;Research on the History of Science, Technology and Culture&quot; Part 3 of &quot;Collected Works of Weng Tongwen&quot; &quot;, there are twenty-one surviving articles, one of which talks about silkworm breeding, eleven on the history of publishing, two on the custom of sitting on chairs, one on the history of gunpowder, one on the incorruptibility of Han corpses, and one on It talks about the observations of genetic phenomena by people in the Tang Dynasty, and the other four articles talk about social and cultural exchanges between China and foreign countries, covering a wide range of topics. The most direct impression is that Mr. Weng is a traditional scholar who has read many Chinese books in depth. However, because he has studied and taught in the West for a long time, his research interests and narrative stance are fundamentally different from those of traditional scholars. Whether he reads common books or Xi Jian&#39;s books all have unique insights and revelations, numerous discoveries, solid evidence, and new and reliable conclusions. These are the common characteristics of this group of papers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Let’s talk about the history of publishing first. From writing to publishing, the Tang Dynasty was a critical period. Exactly when the earliest engravings began has been debated among bibliophiles. Due to the discovery of Dunhuang posthumous documents and new documents, the earliest publication was probably in Shuzhong during the Yizong period. As for the scriptures found in South Korea with Empress Wu&#39;s new characters, the exact date of publication is still controversial. The articles written by Mr. Weng Tongwen were written at different times, but they involve more detailed interpretations and discovery of documents. Here is a summary, which is very enlightening to read. &quot;Correct Interpretation of the Word &quot;Mule&quot; in Yuan Zhen&#39;s Writings Intertwined with the History of Printing&quot; is a large article that analyzes it from a small perspective. In December of the fourth year of Changqing reign of Yuanzhen, he wrote the &quot;Preface to the Collection of Baishi Changqing&quot;. There is a self-note: &quot;Yang and Yuejian wrote many calligraphy models of Le Tian and Yu&#39;s miscellaneous poems, which were sold in shops.&quot; Hu Zhenheng of the Ming Dynasty also wrote It is believed that &quot;Mule&quot; refers to engraving and printing. In modern times, Hu Shi advocated Youli, and then there were as many as 20 or 30 writers. Only three people such as Xiang Da expressed their opposition, thinking that &quot;Mule&quot; refers to double-line hooks to draw white. Reproduction technology of ink marks on poetry manuscripts. Mr. Weng agreed with Xiang and analyzed the interpretation and changes of the two words in the past dynasties from the etymology and word formation, hoping that future researchers will no longer be troubled by this word. His argumentation process was extremely rigorous, and he had two unexpected gains. First, he compared the word &quot;mo&quot; with the words &quot;mo&quot;, &quot;motuo&quot;, &quot;motuo&quot;, &quot;mole&quot;, and &quot;moji&quot; that have appeared successively since the Eastern Han Dynasty. They must all be the same. &quot;The technique of making copies on paper according to the original pattern of writing strokes or ink marks.&quot; The second is to prove that &quot;mule&quot; is a new term that appeared in the mid-Tang Dynasty. This argument may seem trivial, but it actually resolves the ambiguity in the interpretation of a large number of documents related to engraving issues in the Middle Ages, and the conclusion is fully credible. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; &quot;The earliest self-engraved poetry collection was Chen Yong, a native of Shu in the late Tang Dynasty&quot;. It is not long, but it is very interesting. &quot;Si Ku Yuan Jiu&quot; identifies the person who first engraved a collection of poems as Qian Shu Guanxiu, whose disciple Tanyu&#39;s &quot;Preface to the Collection of Chanyue&quot; says: &quot;Then I searched for and inspected the collection of poems and secretly memorized about a thousand poems, which were carved into a volume. The title is &quot;Collection of Chanyue.&quot; This preface was written in the fifth year of Qiande in the former Shu Dynasty &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>;(923)&lt;/span>;, and it is clear that there is no Disagreement. Ye Dehui&#39;s &quot;Shu Lin Qing Hua&quot; according to the &quot;Old History of the Five Dynasties - He Ning Biography&quot; states that &quot;there are hundreds of volumes collected, self-sealed on the board, hundreds of seals printed, and benefits distributed to others&quot;, which lists his events before Guanxiu. Mr. Weng believes that He Ning is later than Guan Xiu, and there is no absolute date for the engraving of his books, so he disagrees. He uncovered a neglected record from &quot;Beimeng Suoyan&quot;, that is, Chen Yong, a Jinshi during the reign of Emperor Zhaozong, had a pair of lines at the beginning of his poem: &quot;Buffaloes on the other side cross with their noses floating on their noses, and sandbirds nod their way along the stream.&quot; Taoist priest Du Guangting Questioned, these two sentences are not good, &quot;Why should this be the beginning of the volume?&quot; Chen Yong replied: &quot;It was once rewarded by the nobles, so it is engraved on the beginning of the volume.&quot; Mr. Weng revealed this article, which is of course very valuable and should be able to supplement the previous ones. A case study of Shu engraved poetry collection. Whether the absolute date is earlier than Guanxiu can be discussed again. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; &quot;The earliest publisher in world history appeared in Chang&#39;an in the middle and late Tang Dynasty&quot;, first based on Dunhuang documents, it was confirmed that there was a person selling almanacs in the second year of Emperor Xizong&#39;s reign in the late Tang Dynasty. The Fan Shang family in Chengdu and the Bian family in Longchifang, Chengdu County, which sold Buddhist mantras, are all mentioned in the discussions of Zhang Xiumin, Li Shuhua, and Qian Cunxun. Chen Zuolong, a bookseller in Chang&#39;an, has passed the examination of two calligraphers surnamed Li. Mr. Weng even cited the example of Bo 2633&#39;s &quot;Mrs. Cui&#39;s Training of Women&quot;, although it was a banknote version, but there was no &quot;printed version of the Li family in Shangdu&quot; at the end, so it was written based on the printed version. I have read this volume again and again. The so-called &quot;Praise to Bai Shilang&quot; is definitely named after Bai Juyi, and the work may not have been published during Bai Juyi&#39;s lifetime. The second is Bo&#39;s 2675 reverse note of &quot;New Collection of Emergency Moxibustion Sutra&quot;, which has the characters &quot;Seal of the Li family in Beijing in Dongshi&quot; at the end. Although it can be inferred to be after the second year of Xiantong, it is also very precious. The third one is a printed copy of the Si 8010 residual calendar, with the cross &quot;Shangdu Shi Dongshi Dadaojia seal&quot; at the end, which is considered to belong to a bookstore or publisher with &quot;Da Dao&quot; as its inscription. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; In the two articles about movable type printing, in addition to researching Bi Sheng&#39;s invention of clay movable type printing stated in Shen Kuo&#39;s &quot;Mengxi Bi Tan&quot;, Mr. Weng vigorously pursued Bi Sheng His real life and what inspired his clay movable type skills. Particularly exciting among them are &quot;the doubts caused by clay type and its efficiency issues&quot; and &quot;the reason why movable type could not replace engraving before the late Qing Dynasty&quot;. The former, based on bits and pieces of records, shows that Bi Sheng had several projects in succession in the two hundred years after Bi Sheng. Several attempts were made, but there was no big development. Mr. Weng’s explanation for this is that although Bi Sheng was the first to invent movable type, there was no inheritance of movable type in the future. Instead, everyone kept starting from scratch and never overcame the shortcomings of the crude and rough movable type. Although China invented movable type printing, it did not replace woodblock printing. Fundamental changes did not occur until Western technology was introduced. &quot;Supplementary Discussion on the Invention of European Movable Type Plate Also Induced by Engraving Printing&quot; examines the way Europeans experimented with printing techniques before Gutenberg in Germany promoted the principle of movable type in the 15th century. In particular, he saw that the high frequency of letter engraving made it easier for Westerners to get ideas. Chinese woodblock printing methods inspired Europeans even more prominently. Although there are many speculations in this article, the basic insights are still within a reasonable range, and what I see is quite reasonable. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; In addition, the study of the life and book engraving career of Chen Qi, a descendant of Wu Zhao from the Later Shu Dynasty, the Xiangtai Yue family of the Southern Song Dynasty, and the book printer, are also included. They are all important and key figures in the history of Chinese printing. It is interesting to read clearly. &quot;Printing reduces the cost of books by nine-tenths&quot; is also an interesting topic. What I am more interested in is the interesting story at the end of the article about the fairy Wu Cailuan&#39;s book &quot;Tang Yun&quot;. Mr. Weng continued the opinion of Taiwanese scholar Wang Meng&#39;ou and believed that Wu Cailuan&#39;s &quot;Tang Yun&quot; was hidden in the National Palace Museum in Taipei. He always regretted not being able to see it in person. According to Zhou Zumo&#39;s &quot;Collection of Yun Shu of the Tang and Five Dynasties&quot; &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>; (Zhonghua Book Company)&lt;/span>;, this volume is stored in the Palace Museum in Beijing and was photocopied by Zhou After reading the complete version, it was concluded that it was the Tang Dynasty Pei Wuqi&#39;s orthographic version of &quot;Public Mistakes, Filling the Gap and Qie Yun&quot;, not Sun Wei&#39;s &quot;Tang Yun&quot;. As for the book written by the female fairy Wu Cailuan, it is only a beautiful legend caused by the inscription and postscript of Xiang Yuanbian of the Ming Dynasty, and cannot be taken as true. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img img-id=&quot;73968&quot; group-id=&quot;0&quot; asset-id=&quot;70759&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23 /12/05/61524c0624.jpg&quot; img-title=&quot;WeChat picture_20231204164056.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;714&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm .com/cms/medias/image/23/12/05/61524c0624.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;260817&quot; style=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center ;&quot;>;In the 1950s, Weng Tongwen (first from right) was in France with his friends. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;3. Science and Technology Life History Research: Daily and Important Perspectives&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Regarding life history, Mr. Weng Tongwen talks about the origin of chairs in China These two magnificent articles are examined in the context of global human history. They not only draw on the insights of Chinese and foreign scholars, but also extensively quote rich material objects obtained from literature and archaeology, and strive to restore the Chinese people from sitting low or kneeling to gradually sitting high. The process, including the &quot;Chronological Record of Rope Bed Materials&quot;, covers a period of more than 700 years. It mentions six chairs that appeared east of Congling from the Jin Dynasty to the end of the Six Dynasties. Five of them originated from India, which further proves that the chairs were introduced from India via the Silk Road. He also came to the same conclusion when he investigated the special-shaped rope beds of chairs, and proved that most of them were related to monks and monasteries. He pointed out that the rope bed was a tool for monks to meditate and meditate, and some monks developed the habit of not lying down day and night throughout their lives, and most of them He sat on the rope bed. After the Middle Tang Dynasty, he examined the traces of chairs entering the palace and scholar&#39;s homes, and explained that chairs also led to an increase in the height of other furniture, such as tables, tall cabinets, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Mr. Weng talked about the era when the book &quot;The Synopsis of Zhenyuan Miaodao&quot; was written. Based on the mention of Yanluozi in the book, it is suspected that it was written in the middle and late Five Dynasties. . I quoted the general rules of Taoist discussion from Taoist books, and felt that it was more likely to be written in the Song Dynasty. Based on the experience of the Waidan family, the article believes that incendiary gunpowder weapons began in the Song Dynasty, and the emergence of firecrackers should be after Song Renzong. The general conclusion can be believed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; &quot;Three Interlocking Inventions Traced to Silk Production Techniques&quot; is the first and most important article in this part, so I I’ll introduce it at the end. China is a large agricultural country, and there has been a tradition of men farming and women weaving since ancient times. This article will explain that China&#39;s three great inventions (referring to printing, gunpowder, magnets) or four great inventions (the first three plus papermaking) have certain logic in themselves. His opinion is: 1. The discovery of the use of silk The invention of techniques for breeding silkworms to produce silk and bleaching wadding; 2. Papermaking originated from the imitation of &quot;natural paper&quot; appearing in bleached wadding; 3. Block printing originated from the combination of &quot;printable paper&quot; and &quot;plate lettering&quot;; 4. Movable type printing technology was conceived due to the &quot;phenomenon of discarding undamaged carved boards&quot;. Although this does not include all the four great inventions, it well explains the intrinsic reason why only China can pioneer the invention of papermaking and printing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img img-id=&quot;73966&quot; group-id=&quot;0&quot; asset-id=&quot;70757&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23 /12/05/9bc7149361.jpg&quot; img-title=&quot;WeChat picture_20231204162745.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;1504&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm .com/cms/medias/image/23/12/05/9bc7149361.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;260818&quot; style=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center ;&quot;>;&quot;Collected Works of Weng Tongwen&quot;, Zhejiang People&#39;s Publishing House, 2019. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;4. Standing between tradition and modernity, showing the path for future generations to learn&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Finally, I would like to express my gratitude to Mr. Weng Tongwen as the representative Make a brief summary of the academic achievements and characteristics of the older generation of scholars. Mr. Weng Tongwen is a generation of scholars born in the early Republic of China, and his research path continued until the end of the twentieth century. When he was born, the Qing Dynasty was already dead, but he was proficient in the four classics, based on the Classics, and enriched with poetry. He took notes because of his gains in reading, and concentrated on writing papers based on his experiences. This is a traditional academic method. There are still lingering thoughts. However, the trend since the early Republic of China has strongly advocated using Western learning to explore the path of national salvation and development, and has also led humanities scholars to strive to accept Western academic approaches and explore various new academic topics related to life and society that the sages often ignored. Mr. Weng Tongwen was initially educated at Southwest Associated University, Yunnan University and St. John&#39;s University. He studied and worked in Britain, France, Germany, the United States, New Zealand and other countries, and finally served in universities in Taiwan. His studies are rooted in tradition, and his vision and methods are deeply influenced by Western studies. He combines literature with cultural relics to fully integrate society and life. He pays special attention to the lower society, special skills and basic classics. As mentioned above in this article, there are less than a hundred articles in the &quot;Sikubiaoyao Supplement&quot;. The long ones are more than a thousand words, and the short ones are only a hundred words. However, what they say must contain new insights and maintain a high spirit. It is a reference to the sayings of many famous writers in modern times. , all with outspoken comments. Articles on the history of life, science and technology, and publishing history can also exhaust the literature, refer to the sages of the times, analyze the subtle ideas, invent new insights, cite abundantly, be cautious in speaking, have clear opinions, and write well. Being peaceful can fully reflect everyone&#39;s style and can show the path for future generations to follow. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 06 Dec 2023 09:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[感冒发烧了，到底感染了啥？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261944]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-12-06 08:01:37&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/ image/23/12/06/d8d9dbf252.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;2860&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/ 06/d8d9dbf252.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;260833&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 06 Dec 2023 08:25:04 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
