The market has set off rounds of discussions around whether quantitative funds are &quot;tools for cutting leeks and vampires of the stock market.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But the leading quantitative funds, which have always been low-key, continue to make news. At the end of August, according to reports from multiple media outlets including Securities Times and Brokerage China, Qiu Huiming, founder of Minghong Investment, purchased Shanghai’s “first luxury home” for 285 million yuan. At the end of October, news of an extramarital affair among the founders of another leading quantitative company, Magic Square, spread widely in the asset management circle. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A private equity firm chairman told a Southern Weekend reporter: &quot;The biggest problem with quantitative funds is that no one has publicly disclosed specific operating methods.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Mysterious quantitative investment How exactly does it work? Why does quantitative investing become the target of public criticism during a stock market downturn? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporters recently interviewed a large number of domestic quantitative investors. What&#39;s interesting is that they are eager to explain to the outside world what quantification is, but they also want to hide behind the scenes - &quot;Low-key, we must be low-key.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Simons’ followers&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In 2010, the American high-speed network provider Spread Networks spent US$300 million to build a long-distance network between Chicago and New York. The straightest optical cable of 1,330 kilometers only shortens the time for high-frequency traders to obtain information by 0.003 seconds. Michael Lewis tells this true story in his book &quot;High Frequency Traders: Wall Street&#39;s Speed ​​Game.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this year, China&#39;s CSI 300 stock index futures were officially launched, providing a hedging tool for domestic quantitative investment. Many Chinese returned to China from Wall Street to start their own businesses. 2010 is therefore recognized as the first year of quantification in China. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To date, a leading quantitative private equity fund executive has provided data to Southern Weekend reporters: Domestic funds plus overseas funds such as Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect and QFII currently account for the total turnover of quantitative transactions in the A-share market. The proportion is 25%-30%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;James Simons, the &quot;Father of Quantitative Investment&quot;, is the spiritual mentor of this group of practitioners. Most of the interviewees mentioned the book &quot;The Man Who Conquered the Market&quot;. This book records the story of how Simons successfully transformed mathematical algorithms and computer trading software into &quot;stock market gold mining&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The book mentions that the origin of quantitative investment can be traced back to the late 1980s. Before this, no one believed that computers could invest like humans, but Simons and the quantitative investors behind him firmly believed: &quot;There must be a way to model prices.&quot; They do not believe that the market is a &quot;random walk&quot; that is unpredictable. Although there is a certain degree of randomness, if a certain probability distribution is used, future price trends can be predicted. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among James Simmons’ followers, there are more Chinese than most people imagine. A high-frequency trader who returned to China in 2015 still can’t figure out why there are so many Chinese doing quantitative work in the United States. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Chinese account for at least one-third, and they are all over the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq institutions, either doing IT or data models.” He told Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, Sam, the founder of a leading quantitative agency in China, thinks this is easy to understand, &quot;The Chinese do not have outstanding advantages in other aspects. Investment banks are also very good, but do you know anyone?&quot;&lt;/p>; p>; &lt;p>;After Dr. Sam graduated, he became a high-frequency trader on Wall Street. He tried to test programmed trading in the domestic market around 2006, &quot;But at that time, it took 15 seconds for domestic market data to get to me, and it took 15 seconds to send an order to the exchange. The 30-second round trip speed made it impossible to make money with real orders. &quot;. Sam told Southern Weekend reporters that the round trip should not exceed 3 seconds at most, and the delay will bring about price changes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In June 2013, the new &quot;Securities Investment Fund Law of the People&#39;s Republic of China&quot; was officially implemented. Private equity was allowed to register and open accounts, and could issue its own products without having to rely on brokerage channels. This year Sam returned to China. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;When I returned to China, the speed could already reach within 1 second. Now the Shenzhen Exchange can do it in several milliseconds. However, in the US market, everyone is pursuing microseconds (one millisecond is equal to 1,000 microseconds). &quot;He said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At this stage, some senior figures from top overseas quantitative institutions began to return to China to start their own businesses, including Ren Sihong of Technetium Capital, Wang Chen of Jiukun Investment, Xu Xiaobo of Ruitian Investment, Qiu Huiming of Mingtun Investment, Yin. Xu Shunan from Nuo Assets and others. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2014, Cai Meijie, vice president of the sales and trading department of CICC, founded Lingjun Investment; in 2015, three students from the Department of Computer Science at Zhejiang University, including Xu Jin, switched from the IT field to quantitative investment and created Magic Square Quantify. Huanfang, Minghong, Jiukun, and Ling are all known as the &quot;Four Kings&quot; of quantification, with each asset management scale exceeding 60 billion yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2015, China’s quantitative private equity market mainly focused on hedging products. Stock index futures were restricted in the second half of 2015, and the overall scale of quantitative private equity declined instead of increasing in the following three years. In 2021, quantification as a whole will enter a period of rapid development. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;2021 is the most lively year. The entire market has turned to small-cap stocks. The market found that bulls can no longer sell subjectively. Looking back, the quantitative excess returns were done very well. At that time The scale of the industry has basically doubled,&quot; a quantitative practitioner told a reporter from Southern Weekend. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At this stage, Mingtun Investment and Huanfang Investment once expanded their management scale to 100 billion levels. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;Where are the talents? &lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;, &lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Where are we&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Around Zhongguancun and Wudaokou area , China’s “Four Big Kings of Quantification” Huanfang, Jiukun, Lingjun, Minghong, etc. all have offices. They are close to Tsinghua Science and Technology Park, Zhongguancun Entrepreneurship Street and other places. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The location is selected because &quot;where the talents are, we are.&quot; These companies have gathered top students from prestigious universities around the world, including Stanford, Cambridge, and MIT. On the promotional wall of an institution, Zhejiang University in Northern Qing Dynasty was ranked in the bottom three. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“There are a lot of people from the Yao class in leading quantitative companies.” A practitioner told a Southern Weekend reporter. When a quantitative investment institution was recruiting people, it was stated that &quot;non-Tsinghua Yao class or Olympiad medal winners will not be accepted.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2005, Yao Qizhi, a world-renowned computer scientist and founder of the world&#39;s modern cryptography foundation, founded the Tsinghua Academy Computer Science Experimental Class, which was referred to as the &quot;Yao Class&quot;. There is a saying that &quot;China&#39;s talents are in Tsinghua, and Tsinghua&#39;s talents are in the Yao class.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The original intention of Yaoban&#39;s establishment was to select and cultivate the world&#39;s top computer geniuses. A Tsinghua University graduate described this as, “These are the most carefully selected and top-notch people in the country’s number one computer science department.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Most of these young people are born in the 1990s, both men and women. They were typing on the keyboard in the office, with four huge computer screens placed on their desks. At a glance, there are lines of code data. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The general division of labor in traditional subjective funds is that analysts provide information, fund managers make decisions, and traders execute orders according to the instructions of the fund manager. &quot;Quantitative funds no longer have the concept of traders or traders, but are called strategy developers and quantitative engineers.&quot; Wang Xiong, founder of Siyuan Quantitative, told Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The person who sets the model is the core person of the quantitative company. The model is composed of people + computing power. The development of quantitative trading strategies involves mathematical models, statistical analysis, machine learning and other technologies. Engineers write and test code, backtesting using historical data to evaluate the potential performance of the strategy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Therefore, their day&#39;s work content can be summarized in three words: &quot;write code&quot;, &quot;more like a coder&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In February 2023, the leading quantitative company Huanfang Quantitative and Ruitian Investment went to court. The reason was that a strategist from Ruitian Investment took away the team and joined Huanfang. Due to the long-term high contact between the strategist and The core trade secret in quantitative investment - the quantitative trading strategy code, Ruitian Investment believes that the other party is suspected of trade secret infringement and unfair competition. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to the competition for talent, quantitative funds also compete for computing power. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“The institution that holds the largest number of high-performance GPUs in China is not an artificial intelligence company, but a quantitative investment company. Huanfang is the number one.” A domestic GPU agent told a Southern Weekend reporter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The CPU that ordinary people are familiar with is responsible for reading the original data and temporarily storing the data in the memory. The GPU calculates the data, trains the model to obtain the parameters of the model, and performs inference and prediction without relying on humans. brain experience. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;An IT industry person told a Southern Weekend reporter: &quot;A CPU only has dozens of physical cores, while a GPU has tens of thousands of CUDA cores.&quot; Core can be understood as a computing core, and a GPU is used to train a large computer. The model is calculated on a monthly basis. Correspondingly, if a traditional CPU is used, it is calculated on an annual basis. The training efficiency is very different, and the inference efficiency gap is also more than a hundred times. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The NVIDIA A100 graphics card is a professional-grade GPU with very powerful computing power, reaching 19.5 TFLOPS (19.5 trillion floating-point operations per second). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2019, Magic Square Quantitative established an AI company equipped with 1,100 GPUs. In 2021, Huanfang owns tens of thousands of Nvidia A100 graphics cards. The above-mentioned IT people were shocked by this number, which has exceeded the reserves of some major domestic Internet companies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sam explained that since 2016, quantitative investment has adopted medium-low frequency Alpha plus T+0 (intraday reversal trading) as the main style. After 2018, it will be full-cycle models and deep learning models. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“If you are building a deep learning model, researchers need to keep trying different parameters, structures, and features. A researcher can assign dozens of cards. Of course, you can also assign hundreds of cards. It’s all taken up, but it should be difficult for one person to think of so many ideas at the same time.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For a researcher to be able to configure dozens of cards, the above-mentioned IT industry people think this is bragging. Both graduated from Tsinghua University. He worked in a large factory to quantify models, and the configuration was one person per card. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Covering nearly&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;2000&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>; stocks&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;&quot;&lt;/strong >;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Few people know how quantitative investing makes money. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;An individual investor who purchased Magic Square quantitative products is well aware of the romantic stories of quantitative giants. But regarding quantitative investment, she admitted to Southern Weekend reporters: &quot;I don&#39;t understand.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The chairman of another private equity fund with a fund management scale of nearly 5 billion yuan invested a lot of his family assets in a leading quantitative company. His understanding of quantification is that market massacre is carried out based on the behavior patterns of hot money and retail investors, and quantification’s own self-operated strategies and transactions take precedence over asset management. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yang Delong, chief economist of Qianhai Kaiyuan Fund, used the &quot;dog walking theory&quot; to explain to Southern Weekend reporters. “Value investing pays more attention to the path people (fundamentals) take, but quantification mainly aims to achieve excess returns by discovering the movement patterns of dogs (stock prices).” Yang Delong said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Quantitative trading is called &quot;Quantitative Trading&quot; or &quot;Quantitative Investment&quot; overseas. Quantitative (quantitative) corresponds to discretionary (discretionary). The latter refers to relying on personal judgment and understanding of a matter. The decision-making process relies on personal judgment and has a greater degree of freedom. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Quantitative investment is an investment method based on data and with mathematical models (statistical models) as the core. It is completely based on data. We call it quantitative, while subjective investment is more qualitative.&quot; Sam Speaking to Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In his view, whether it is an individual investor or an institutional investor, everyone has behavioral inertia, but the way of thinking is not necessarily completely rational, and mistakes will be made in the process. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He divided quantification into two parts. The quantitative analysis of fundamentals is very similar to subjective, looking at public data such as profit growth and cash flow. But on the other hand, quantification will catch the wrong transactions in the market, that is, transactions that deviate from the reasonable prices set by the quantitative model. &quot;After catching a wrong trade, we will buy if the price is lower than the reasonable price, and sell if the price is higher than the reasonable price.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Taking Moutai as an example, subjective investment may judge that the stock will rise, but quantification will clearly indicate a Forecast: &quot;We would say that this stock will outperform the market by 1% over the next 10 days, with an error of ±5%. This is entirely a statistical concept.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Quantification relies on various data (price volume Mainly based on data), the company&#39;s stock price shows a certain regular distribution, and this reasonable price refers to a range.&quot; A quantitative practitioner told a Southern Weekend reporter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yang Delong believes that there is an essential difference between quantification and value investing. “Quantitation relies more on stock price fluctuations to make money, so it is called cutting leeks. They take a short-term approach and calculate based on the day. Value investments are generally held for several years.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Quantitative practitioners are not shy about this. Domestic mainstream quantitative private equity mostly uses statistical arbitrage as its core strategy. The forecast period ranges from intraday to several days, and generally does not exceed 10 days. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Quantitative stock selection has no standards and characteristics, and does not set industries and fields. They do not pay attention to whether the company has new products, nor do they pay attention to what the secretary of the board of directors said. When a stock&#39;s stock price is &quot;overbought&quot; according to model calculations, quantification will directly trigger the selling of the stock without any human emotions or subjective judgments in the process. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many leading quantitative practitioners told Southern Weekend reporters that a mature large-scale quantitative company will conduct a market-wide scan of more than 5,000 stocks on the market, and do it whenever there is an opportunity. Liquidity You can do it if it&#39;s good, or you can do it if the liquidity is bad. The difference lies in whether you make more or less money. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Our bottom position currently covers nearly 2,000 A-share stocks.” Sam told Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In comparison, 50 subjective long positions in stocks are already considered a lot. This has brought about a huge difference in turnover rates. A brokerage person told a Southern Weekend reporter: &quot;The turnover rate of equity public funds is generally 3-5 times, up to about 10 times, which is already relatively active.&quot;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;The data provided by quantitative practitioners to Southern Weekend reporters is that most of the current mainstream products of quantitative private equity generally have a turnover rate of 50-100 times. In addition, there are extremely small-scale niche strategies that have a turnover rate of 200 times. above. The annual turnover rate of the stock quantitative strategy is about 100 times, which is equivalent to an average holding period of about 5 days. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sam decided to return to China to start a business in 2013. One of the important reasons was, &quot;At that time, domestic individual investors accounted for 90%, and the entire market was too speculative. I brought back the American model, and the American model Alpha can probably achieve 6%, but at that time the domestic market could achieve nearly 40%.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Alpha and beta are risk quantification indicators proposed by Nobel Prize winner William Sharp in 1964. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Quantitative companies rely on thousands of Alphas to find various patterns in the market. Southern Weekend reporters visited a number of domestic leading quantitative companies in mid-November. In their office areas, the &quot;a&quot; of Alpha was made into an icon and placed in the most eye-catching position. Alpha and Beta are also words that appear frequently among practitioners. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yang Lei is a post-90s private equity quantitative manager in Shanghai. He gave an example to a reporter from Southern Weekend: If it is a strategy to pursue Alpha, assuming that the market (take the wind all-A index as an example) has increased by 10% in a year, and a certain strategy has increased by 12%, then the Alpha (excess return) of a certain strategy relative to the market ) is 2%. If the strategy can maintain this excess level, if the market falls by 10% in the second year, the strategy will only fall by 8%, and still have an excess return of 2%. The pursuit of Alpha refers to the pursuit of outperforming the market in the long term. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If you are pursuing Beta, it is a concept of multiples. For example, the market has risen by 10% this year, and a certain strategy has risen by 1.5*10%=15%. However, if the market falls by 10% in the second year, it will It will also fall by 1.5*10%=15%. It is equal to the strategy amplifying the fluctuations of the market. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Can quantitative investment outperform the market? The private equity ranking network shows that as of the end of the third quarter of 2023, the average return of 537 quantitative private equity firms with performance updates was 3.36%, and more than 70% of them achieved positive returns. The average return rate of tens of billions of quantitative private equity is 5.75%, and companies with positive returns account for more than 90%. &lt;br>;&lt;br>;Sam told Southern Weekend reporters: &quot;Quantitative is worse than subjective in terms of reasonable pricing in the short and medium term, but it is not as good as excellent subjective fund managers in terms of reasonable pricing in medium and long term.&quot; The advantage of subjective is in its ability to price individual stocks. In-depth analysis, this quantification is currently unattainable. &lt;br>;&lt;br>;Even Renaissance Technology, a company founded by James Simons, has experienced dismal performance in 2020 for its three funds after years of rapid growth. According to a Bloomberg report cited by brokerage China in February 2021, three Renaissance funds open to ordinary investors have suffered redemptions of at least US$5 billion (approximately 32.2 billion yuan) since December 1, 2020. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Quantification of disputes&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;On August 27, 2023, “halve the stamp duty collection, gradually tighten the pace of IPO and refinancing, and standardize the reduction of shareholdings. behavior, lowering the financing margin ratio”, four favorable policies were launched in one day. But the next day, A-shares opened up 5% and then fell back quickly, closing with only a 1% gain. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Who is the culprit? Quantification has become a target. Many investors believe that the sharp opening triggers the selling of large-scale quantitative funds, which are the &quot;biggest air force&quot; responsible for market fluctuations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A war of words started in the circle of friends of investment tycoons. Investors who opposed quantification pushed the article &quot;Quantitative Funds, the Main Force of Today&#39;s Slam&quot; to over 100,000, while many founders of leading quantitative institutions reprinted another article - &quot;Quantification is the Backbone of Big A&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On September 1, 2023, the China Securities Regulatory Commission guided stock exchanges to introduce a series of measures to strengthen the supervision of programmed trading. Among them, &quot;transactions with a maximum declaration rate of more than 300 transactions per second, or a maximum number of declarations in a single day of more than 20,000 transactions&quot; will be monitored with emphasis. and impose additional reporting requirements on high-frequency trading. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, many quantitative practitioners interviewed said: &quot;The standards of 300 declarations per second and 20,000 declarations a day have little impact on quantification.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The highest declaration in a single day The number of transactions reaches 20,000, which can be achieved with a small account but high turnover. But if the turnover is low and the scale is large, this number can also be used. Sam gives an example: For example, a certain public fund has an account worth several billion. The turnover is not high, with only 5% unilateral and 10% bilateral per day. However, the transaction volume is 500 million per day, and the average order is about 20,000 yuan. There are more than 20,000 orders. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“If we see trading opportunities at the opening, 5,000 stocks will have opportunities. Theoretically, we can issue 5,000 orders in one second. However, domestic trading desks cannot support it. It is impossible for a securities firm to have only you as a customer. At present, The maximum is 1,000 transactions,&quot; Sam told Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Quantitative practitioners have repeatedly emphasized that programmed trading does not only refer to quantitative trading. Programmed trading refers to investment tools corresponding to &quot;manual trading&quot;. Programmed automated decision-making is used to perform operations, and transactions can be completed at the same time. Thousands of assets, which manual trading cannot do. In addition to quantitative and private equity, public funds and subjective investments will also use programmed trading. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A-shares experienced huge fluctuations in 2015, and the case of Easton manipulating the futures market became a sensation. The company used programmed trading software to automatically place orders in batches, buy and sell by itself, and use trading rules such as margin leverage ratios to illegally make more than 2 billion yuan in profit. The average order speed of Ishton is one order every 0.03 seconds. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sam said that stock index futures are particularly suitable for high-frequency products. Ishton was able to do it in seconds back then, and it has not changed much now. But &quot;there are only a few people who speculate in futures, and they are very gambling. The mainstream is still stock quantification.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Xiong, founder of Siyuan Quantitative, told Southern Weekend reporters: &quot;As far as stock quantification is concerned, A-share trading cannot have the so-called high-frequency pursuit of speed in foreign countries.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From the perspective of trading mechanism, recognized high-frequency trading basically does not exist in China’s stock market due to the imposition of stamp duties. &quot;Because I can&#39;t make any money, the speed advantage of a few seconds can&#39;t cover the stamp duty.&quot; Sam told Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to him, the current shortest position holding period in China is 5 minutes to 20 minutes. Overseas, it cannot be considered high frequency. At most, it is only intraday trading. In the United States, high frequency trading basically takes a few seconds. A warehouse is only a few minutes slow. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sam still remembers that when he was a high-frequency trader on Wall Street, by constantly changing hands, he could build a position of up to 200 million US dollars with a capital of 10 million US dollars. &quot;In China, our positions are held for an average of about 5 days. The purpose of these 5 days is not to get the order as quickly as possible, but to pursue a better excess performance.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, the exchange&#39;s matching Speed ​​is not supported either. &quot;For example, when you send an order to the Shanghai Stock Exchange, it basically takes 30 milliseconds to wait for a return. In the United States, everyone is pursuing 1 microsecond, so if you have a fluctuation of 30 milliseconds ± 1 millisecond, it is meaningless to pursue that 1 microsecond. .&quot; Sam told Southern Weekend reporter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But they are actually pursuing speed as much as possible. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A founder of a quantitative institution revealed to a reporter from Southern Weekend that for some traders who have requirements for transaction speed, domestic exchanges have their own server hosting centers, such as the Shanghai Stock Exchange Waigaoqiao Shanghai Stock Exchange hosting room. , Shenzhen Stock Exchange Southern Center Shenzhentong custody computer room, Shanghai Stock Exchange Jinqiao custody computer room. Only securities and futures companies can rent custody computer room cabinets from the exchange. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;High-end programmatic trading teams usually purchase their own equipment or specify hardware configurations, which are purchased by securities and futures companies. With the consent of the securities and futures companies, they are placed in rented cabinets for trading. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Around 2014, Hwabao Securities launched the LTS system, which was the first ultra-fast trading counter system in the industry. Since then, many securities firms have begun “rushing for ultra-fast trading”, mostly for quantitative private equity customers. , but there are threshold requirements for the amount of funds for customers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;There are no hard and fast requirements for the capital threshold of the Express Trading Desk, but we generally advertise that it is exclusive to high-net-worth customers. Each threshold is different, some are 1 million yuan, and some are 3 million yuan.&quot; One person Brokerage traders told Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A practitioner from a private equity institution told a reporter from Southern Weekend: &quot;Nowadays, large-scale quantitative funds are mostly used for self-operation. They operate with self-operated funds and leverage, and their performance is the best in asset management.&quot; Several times.&quot; However, the self-operated scale data cannot be queried. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(At the request of the interviewee: Sam and Yang Lei are pseudonyms)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 05 Dec 2023 21:25:05 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[出生3个月被拐，25年后找回：新技术助力“天下无拐”丨快评]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261899]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-12-05 20:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Recently, there is news that Hebei “billionaire” Xie Kefeng has recovered his son Xie Qingshuai who has been trafficked for 25 years. It was widely circulated on the Internet and attracted great attention. Netizens were happy that the Xie family was finally reunited. And behind this, it is inseparable from the blessing of technological power. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to media reports, the &quot;cross-age face comparison algorithm of relatives&quot; developed by a technology company was indispensable for the family reunion. Xie Qingshuai was only 3 months old when he was abducted, and his family only has photos of him when he was 3 months old. More than twenty years later, it is obviously an &quot;impossible task&quot; to use this baby photo to find someone. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What makes the impossible possible is to use related faces to compare and find suspected objects. Taking the search for Xie Qingshuai as an example, photos of his biological parents and eldest brother were used to compare with the police&#39;s population database. This comparison is of course relatively vague and may result in multiple results, but it also greatly narrows the scope of the search, making it easier for the police to conduct precise comparisons through DNA testing and other technologies. In this comparison, Qing Shuai was found among the top five suspects. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The “black technology” used to find abducted children, the most familiar to the public is DNA comparison technology. This technology was first used by the police to identify criminal suspects in major criminal cases. As the cost of testing and comparison decreases, the application of DNA technology is becoming more and more widespread, and it also plays a role in the final &quot;final decision&quot; to determine kinship in the fight against trafficking and finding relatives. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, DNA comparison also has great limitations, that is, samples from both parties are required for comparison. Parents searching for relatives will naturally take the initiative to submit their own blood samples to the police, but it is not that easy to obtain samples from abducted children. DNA information is one of the most sensitive biological information of an individual. Without sufficient evidence to suspect, the police cannot force anyone to submit their DNA sample at will. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many of the children’s data in the police anti-trafficking DNA database were submitted to the police by people who knew they had been trafficked, hoping to find their biological parents. Other data comes from trafficked persons rescued by the police during anti-trafficking operations. For those trafficked persons who do not know they are being trafficked and have not been noticed by the police, their DNA information will not appear in the anti-trafficking database and will not be found. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Currently, the police have set up more than 3,000 free blood collection points across the country and publicized them widely, hoping that more people would volunteer to provide blood samples and increase the coverage of the anti-trafficking database. But the number of people who can be included in a DNA database is always limited. In the past, a common method used by families looking for relatives was &quot;human flesh&quot; search. They follow any possible clues and travel all over the country to find relatives all year round, spending time, energy and money. However, the results are very unsatisfactory and very few can actually find the abducted children. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The application of high-tech means such as face comparison and recognition has greatly improved the efficiency of finding relatives. As early as 2019, the police began to use the cross-age facial recognition technology developed by Tencent, and successfully found a child who had been abducted for 10 years using a photo of the abducted child when he was 3 years old. But the technology at the time wasn&#39;t precise enough. According to his father, at that time, 100 suspected persons were found for each identification. The police usually selected the top 5 for DNA review, and the probability of missing a hit was very high. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;With the advancement of computer vision and artificial intelligence technology, the accuracy of comparison is getting higher and higher. You can even compare the results using only photos of close relatives without having to take photos of the child himself. Because everyone has their ID card photo stored in the police database, using photos for identification greatly increases the scope of anti-trafficking comparisons, making it easier to find abducted children. The &quot;cross-age relative face comparison algorithm&quot; helped the police recover four abducted children in just six months, at least three of whom had been abducted for more than 20 years, which shows its ability. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Advanced technology is used to fight abduction and find relatives, which is a good cause. Of course, it must be admitted that if used for evil, its destructive power will be huge. For example, a DNA paternity test may be used to forge paternity test certificates and settle the abducted children at the police station as their &quot;biological&quot; children. Of course, this is fraud, and it may also be said that it has little to do with technology. However, ubiquitous facial recognition is suspected of being abused on a large scale and may infringe on the privacy rights of ordinary people. Technologies such as AI face-changing may also be used in crimes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There used to be a saying on the Internet that &quot;where there are photos, there is the truth.&quot; But with the development of PS technology, photos can no longer represent the truth. Some people use face-swapping techniques to replace the avatars in pornographic photos and use them for blackmail. And with the advancement of video face-changing technology, it is no longer true that &quot;video has the truth&quot;. Today&#39;s AI technology can allow Trump to speak authentic Chinese, with flawless timbre and mouth shape, and it is no problem to fake other videos. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Technology itself is neutral. Every black technology is a double-edged sword that can be used for good or for evil. Not only can technology itself be used for evil, but advanced technology can also be used to do evil. As soon as the high-tech cross-age face matching technology for finding relatives attracted attention, rumors of a &quot;paid version of the relative finding app&quot; appeared on the Internet. Families looking for relatives who are eager to find their own flesh and blood are easily deceived and defrauded of their money. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Advanced technology contains huge power. How to use it, for good or evil, all depends on the thoughts of those who master the technology. Only by keeping technology in the hands of &quot;good people&quot; as much as possible, and with good systems for incentives and prevention, can technology be used to its fullest potential. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, as costs continue to fall, these new technologies will inevitably be available to more and more people, and the possibility of abuse and misuse will become greater and greater. How to prevent advanced technology from being used for evil as much as possible is also a serious issue that must be discussed. The &quot;Gongdou Drama&quot; of OpenAI, which developed ChatGPT some time ago, is related to the attitude towards AI technology to a certain extent. It can be seen that this is no longer a topic of unfounded worry, but an urgent one. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.run&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. run&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 05 Dec 2023 20:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[厦门警方通报2名老师涉嫌性侵大四女生]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261932]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-12-05 19:39:47&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;span>;On the evening of December 4, 2023, “Many teachers from well-known middle schools in Xiamen assaulted and raped them while drunk.

Visual China | Picture&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I was sitting on a small round stool in the outdoor corridor. The stool was short, not very stable, and had no backrest. My feet, which had taken off my shoes, were stepping on a stained floor. I couldn’t walk around on the small carpet because I had to be ready to try on shoes at any time. Fortunately, it was October and I actually felt a cool breeze. Compared to four months ago (mid-June) when I came to order shoes, I was so sweaty that it was so comfortable. too much. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Just sit down and sit down! It has been more than an hour, but it is still better than the shoemaker. It is hard enough to watch him open the soles of the shoes and close the uppers, nailing and hammering. So, although the custom-made shoes have nothing to do with the shape of my feet. They match each other, but they are a bit polar opposite, and they are incompatible with each other. Once the feet are put in, it is as painful as &quot;cutting off the feet to fit the shoes&quot;, but when I heard him repeatedly saying, &quot;It&#39;s okay, what&#39;s wrong with you? I&#39;ll do it for you, I&#39;ll do it for you.&quot; Done.&quot; I saw the enthusiasm and confidence on his face, while he was wandering around the studio filled with debris, looking for insoles and playing with shoe lasts. His movements were slow. He was not in a hurry. I How can you be anxious? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Because I was bored sitting around, I could only look around. This is the upper floor of a factory building. There is a long row of rooms, one after another, facing a long gray corridor outside the door. , there was no one on the promenade, only the shoe store was open. If custom-made shoes hadn&#39;t come to my door, I believe I would never have come to this quiet area in the New Territories. It takes a taxi from where I live, and it costs hundreds of dollars for a round trip. However, because of a pair of feet with many problems, including hallux valgus, flat feet and fasciitis, I have been unable to find comfortable shoes for many years. , I can only hope that I will become Cinderella. One day, a pair of shoes made in heaven will suddenly appear. Once you put on a pair of shoes, you can walk or dance gracefully. If this is the case, then you will not care about anything. I immediately worked hard to pursue it without any expense. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to relieve my worries, my elder brother in Toronto found information from the Internet. He said that there is a mysterious man in Hong Kong who specializes in custom-making shoes for people with special feet. All can be easily solved. This strange man is already very young and is about to retire, so he has to order his shoes quickly, otherwise he will regret it if he misses the opportunity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For many years, if you want to buy shoes, you have to go to Japan to look for them. Maybe it’s because Japanese people often wear kimonos with flip-flops, so many people’s feet are not in the right shape; or maybe it’s because Japan’s national character is particularly careful. Thoughtful, anyway, if I want to find a decent pair of shoes that can fit on my feet, for me, Japan is the only place of origin. Due to the seriousness of the epidemic, I have not been able to go out for three or four years. My old shoes have been reimbursed and new shoes have not yet been obtained. When I heard that there is such a shoe-making wizard in Hong Kong, wouldn’t it make me excited and have to look for it? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The first time I came to make shoes was in mid-June. Finally, we found the reclusive master based on online information, and they actually connected via WhatsApp in a very modern way, and made an appointment to visit him on a Saturday morning. I called a taxi, drove around, walked a long way, arrived on time excitedly, walked into a completely unfamiliar factory building, stepped into a dirty and dilapidated elevator, rushed up to the high-rise building with great difficulty, and finally found the corresponding location. House cards, why is the door locked and black fire? Hurry up and call and contact. After a while, the other party finally answered, &quot;I&#39;m in the hospital! I was injured, and I was looking at a doctor in line!&quot; Ah! Is this okay? Can you hurt your hands with shoes? Isn&#39;t this almost the same as the piano sanctuary? This is not the same! &quot;Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh! &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; After a while, meet again. At that time, Liu Bei took the three cares of Cao Lu, and then invited Zhuge Kongming to help the world. In this world, good things are worn, and you have to achieve a wish. How can it be so easy? So, disturbed the hustle, set foot on the journey for the second time. This time, I finally saw the master&#39;s deity. Honestly, some traditional handicrafts in the local area have gradually become slightly miniaturized, such as hand -made umbrellas, hand -carved sparrows, hand -painted ceramics, hand -made cages, etc. The masters who make cheongsam, are good at embroidered or paper tie craftsmanship have gradually withered withered It is a lot of kindness and respect for decades of persistent and adherence to traditional positions. The master is thin and weak, with a sincere smile on his face, talking about talking, just like a familiar neighborhood, he tells you all kinds of stories as soon as he speaks. Oh, but as soon as he puts on his shoes, he solves the problem; whoever goes to European immigrants, he has to rush back to find him for shoes and so on. After speaking for a long time, I finally remembered that I was going to do business, so I slammed, pulled out a piece of A4 white paper, told the guest to take off their shoes and socks, put their feet on white paper, let him draw a paper -like with the pen group, and then Write the customer&#39;s name and phone call next to it, which has completed the registration procedures. How was it that simple? I have been to many shoe -making stores, and we must continue to measure the shape of the foot with computers and instruments, and even make models to customize. The finished products made with high -tech are often not ideal! Can this old master&#39;s method of steelmaking be done? However, as soon as he saw that he had a bamboo -like bamboo, he had a hearty conversation, and I had to suppress the doubt in my heart. &quot;Try it, maybe, maybe there is a miracle?&quot; &lt;/P>; &lt;p>; &quot;Pay 500 deposits first , After the shoes are ready, pay a thousand yuan! &quot;Is there a receipt? He said no, so he hurriedly made it, thinking that all the talents of the old faction rely on credit, not by the word. He also said, &quot;Everything is clear, and there is a well -evident, you don&#39;t have to worry about it.&quot; When will the shoes do well? &quot;I have only one hand, I keep doing it every day, and I have to turn it! At least a month or two, don&#39;t urge me.&quot; &quot;Okay, don&#39;t urge it.&quot; It seems that he has no assistant or apprentice. I have to consider the hard work of others! &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; I brought two pairs of Japanese shoes that day, or I used to search for loot that I bought everywhere in Japan, because the toe was narrow and did not pass through. To widen the toe, then the merit is immeasurable. &quot;No problem, it&#39;s easy!&quot; He agreed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; That&#39;s it. From June to October, I asked twice, and I told that I was still in line every time. Finally, I came to the end of October, and the shoes were ready! So go to the day and go to accept the finished product. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; There is no fantasy, no hope, so I put a new shoes on the same day, and a drama struck. I didn&#39;t lose or blame. This is an unexpected thing! Of course, the master was not disappointed. He said with confidence: &quot;It&#39;s all like this. Just put on it a little tightly, get it for you, and immediately get it.&quot; So he began to get busy. And me? Sitting in the corridor in time, looking at the scenery on the hillside not far from the opposite side, watching. I saw the window of the public housing was covered with colorful clothes, commonly known as the flag, the green trees under the hillside, and the white clouds floating in the blue sky floating. Suddenly, a group of white pigeons passed by in front of them. Stimuli or calmness, there is only one thought. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; At this time, I think of two pairs of Japanese shoes to be retrieved. Ask the master to take the shoes, he said, &quot;Ah! My memory is not good, I don’t remember where to put it! What is the shoes? What do you look like? &quot;He asked, smiling, and innocently looked at me suddenly reminds me of the launch of Gao Yizhong&#39;s&quot; brain and wisdom &quot;plan. Say it! Then, he said, let your Filipino maids go to the studio to find it yourself! That place is really strange. Rather than saying that the studio, it is better to stack the filling area, full of all kinds of materials and utensils, and only a sheep intestine trail that can pass by sideways. To find the target inside, it should be more than the city. Treasure hunting is even harder! Filipino maids worked hard and returned without merit. When they arrived outside the door, they looked opposite me. The two couldn&#39;t help laughing! &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Here, the master is annoying, and continuously adjusts the self -care, and the shoes are relaxed again and again. In this way, after a dozen rounds, although the heel and foot types have no intention of reconciliation, I think it should be time to receive troops. &quot;The skin of this shoe is very soft. Going back to wear for a few more days, it won&#39;t hurt.&quot; In this life, when you buy shoes and make shoes, which one is not used to such advice? I smiled, quickly nodded and said yes, hurriedly paid the rest, ready to return to the house. Suddenly, the master claimed to me: &quot;If your Japanese shoes are found, I will send you with SF Express. The cost of a dozen dollars, I don&#39;t need to pay it, I will pay!&quot; He said it was full, Blaim! &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; At the time of return, the two pairs of Japanese shoes spent thousands of thousands of Japanese shoes, and three times of Cao Lu, the fare plus shoes, and thousands of them. Can&#39;t even draw it? It is better to open up the heart and relieve it. If there is a day&#39;s shoes that even find it, it will be used as a foreign visitor, and the joy will fall from the sky; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.run&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. run&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 05 Dec 2023 19:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[一起“非典型”涉黑案：曾因律师手机法庭被扣陷舆论风暴]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261925]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;i>; 2023-12-05 18:00:00 &lt;/i>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; &lt;strong>; &amp; nbsp; &lt;/strong>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;IMG ALT = &quot;On November 6, 2023, the defense lawyer of this case Chi Yisheng caused a conflict due to the detained by the phone.

The incident originated from the analysis video uploaded by the blogger &quot;Wheatfield Farmer&quot;. He used software to analyze the 12 song videos taken by fans at the Mayday Shanghai concert on November 16. After extracting the vocal analysis, he accused Mayday of &quot;in 12 songs. &quot;Five of the songs are lip-syncing,&quot; and another one is &quot;the first few lines are fake, but the rest are true.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the incident fermented, it triggered reactions from all parties. Some music bloggers said they had reported it to the China Consumers Association; the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Culture and Tourism said it would require the organizers to cooperate with the investigation; staff of the China Performance Industry Association said they had paid attention to the matter and were &quot;waiting for the results of the cultural law enforcement department.&quot; Mayday officials first posted on Weibo that they would broadcast the entire Paris concert live online, which was interpreted by the outside world as &quot;to dispel doubts.&quot; On December 4, their agency also issued a &quot;solemn statement&quot; stating that &quot;the tour will There is no lip-synching behavior in it.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to media reports, the audio and video materials of the Mayday Shanghai concert have been submitted to the local cultural market inspection department. The relevant departments will conduct scientific evaluation and analysis and publish the investigation results. Regardless of whether Mayday &quot;lip-synced&quot; this time, the old topic of &quot;lip-syncing&quot; has been thrown back into the public opinion field, which deserves further analysis. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First of all, this incident has brought new problems to &quot;how to define lip-synching&quot;, which requires industry research and follow-up. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to Article 31 of the &quot;Implementing Rules of the Commercial Performance Management Regulations&quot;, lip-synching &quot;refers to the act of actors using pre-recorded songs and music instead of live singing during the performance.&quot; In this incident, judging from the blogger&#39;s accusation, Mayday&#39;s suspected lip-synching was not the simple and crude &quot;pre-recording&quot; in the past, but the method of &quot;back-up singing&quot;: importing instrumental music and music into the concert project file in advance. For the vocal track, &quot;the lower part of the verse is really sung, and the chorus is sung in the background.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If &quot;undersinging&quot; is true, then the definition of &quot;lip-syncing&quot; will have a new question: Does &quot;singing the main song really, singing under the chorus&quot; count as lip-synching? In other words, what percentage of a song must be performed live for it to be considered lip-synching? Furthermore, today, when artificial intelligence has developed to the point where it is difficult to distinguish authenticity from fake, if the AI ​​training voice in the future is &quot;promoted and applied&quot;, how should the industry define and prevent it? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Regulations on the Administration of Commercial Performances&quot; stipulates that &quot;actors may not deceive the audience by lip-synching, and performance organizers shall not organize actors to lip-sync. No unit or individual may provide conditions for lip-synching.&quot; In fact, fake The turmoil caused by lip-synching did not start today. Similar incidents are common, and many singers have become the butt of jokes because of their genuine lip-synching. The reason is simple. Even without the constraints of the Commercial Performance Management Regulations, lip-syncing by entertainers will harm their social reputation. Lip-synching at a concert is unjustifiable in terms of professional ethics and legal responsibility. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since Mayday’s agency has issued a statement categorically denying lip-syncing and accusing the relevant remarks of “malicious attacks and rumors and slander”, one of the two statements must be false, and one party is destined to be suspected of violating relevant laws and regulations. This matter also deserves an authoritative investigation result. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, the &quot;Regulations on the Administration of Commercial Performances&quot; stipulates that &quot;the performance organizer should send special personnel to supervise the performance to prevent the occurrence of lip-synching behavior.&quot; According to a staff member of the Beijing Cultural Market Law Enforcement Corps, Mayday this year Law enforcement officers were on site to supervise the six concerts in Beijing. It is worth asking whether Mayday’s suspected lip-synching was only in Shanghai this time? At the previous six concerts in Beijing, did the on-site law enforcement officers fulfill their responsibilities of &quot;supervising the performances&quot; to prevent lip-synching? This should all be clarified in subsequent investigations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Secondly, this incident also raises a question: how to define and protect the consumer rights of commercial performance audiences. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If Mayday’s lip-synching is true, some viewers’ demands for “refund,” “compensation,” and “apology” should be supported. Of course, there are many viewers who &quot;don&#39;t care whether they actually sing or not&quot;, and there are also many fans who regard the concert as a ticket to a meet-and-greet. After the Mayday suspected lip-synching incident, some fans also said that &quot;just feel the atmosphere of the scene&quot;, &quot;just seeing them is enough&quot; and &quot;it doesn&#39;t matter whether they lip-sync or do the real thing.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is a famous saying in the legal world: &quot;struggle for rights.&quot; Any right needs to be asserted before it can be implemented. It is not difficult to imagine that there are people in the audience who are serious about lip-synching, and there are also people who don&#39;t care about lip-synching. There are people in the audience who have &quot;high standards and strict requirements&quot; for the viewing experience, and there are also people who bought tickets and came in just to have fun. In reality, &quot;concert audiences&quot; are not a homogeneous group, and their expectations for &quot;quality of goods and services&quot; are also different. However, since there are audiences claiming their rights in accordance with the law and regulations, the performers should respect their demands. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, there are a lot of lip-syncing in the European and American music circles. For example, in concerts later in his acting career, Michael Jackson would choose to lip-sync when singing and dancing some dance numbers due to physical reasons, but he The city will state in advance on its official website that the audiences who come for the &quot;moonwalk&quot; are not interested in whether they really sing or not; Pavarotti also lip-synched at the opening ceremony of the Turin Winter Olympics, but a generation of tenors can perform powerfully. He has won the admiration and respect of the world for showing up despite his illness. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the Chinese music scene, &quot;lowering expectations&quot; and &quot;advance notification&quot; are also widely used methods in the industry. For example, some singers lower the key or change the song in order to ensure the true singing effect. This is a frank admission of the voice. I can no longer really sing. In this case, it may be possible to respect the independent management rights of entertainers and require them to fulfill their obligation to inform, not to sell dogs on sheep&#39;s head, and let the market judge and consumers make their choices. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In short, in the face of the controversy over Mayday’s suspected lip-syncing, the industry must define “lip-syncing” more accurately, regulate commercial performances with more detailed legislation and law enforcement, and at the same time In accordance with the Consumer Rights and Interests Protection Act, we protect consumers’ rights to know the truth, make independent choices and fair transactions, and respect the legitimate rights and interests of consumers who come forward to question. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 05 Dec 2023 17:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[湖南一县委书记在下乡调研返程途中坠江身亡]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261911]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-12-05 15:57:45&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;On the afternoon of December 5, the Hunan Rucheng County Party Committee Office issued a notice stating that the deputy director of the Chenzhou Municipal People’s Congress Standing Committee, Comrade Huang Siping, secretary of the Rucheng County Party Committee, died of an accident at 15:31 on December 4 on his way back from a field trip to the countryside.

The Heihe River originates from Qinghai, and Zhangye City is located in the middle reaches. It contains more than 90% of the cultivated land and population in the basin, and more than 80% of the water consumption and GDP. Lushui Bay is known as Zhangye&#39;s &quot;humidifier&quot;, but if too much water is intercepted, it may affect downstream water use. The Ejina Banner of Alxa League in Inner Mongolia in the lower reaches of the Heihe River is one of the origins of sandstorms in the north. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhangye, located in the Hexi Corridor, is located at the intersection of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and the Inner Mongolia Plateau. It is a natural oasis on the Silk Road. The &quot;gold&quot; in the ancient name &quot;Jin Zhangye&quot; not only reflects the wealth of this place, but also shows that in this arid zone oasis, water resources are as precious as gold. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Including Lushuiwan Scenic Area, the inspection report showed that there are more than 30 artificial water surfaces in Zhangye City with illegal and illegal problems, with a total water area of ​​more than 6,000 acres. These artificial water surfaces, which have only appeared in the past ten years, also carry expectations for the transformation and upgrading of Zhangye&#39;s cultural tourism industry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, Zhangye City was designated as my country&#39;s first water-saving society pilot area by the Ministry of Water Resources as early as 2002, and has made many water-saving explorations. However, this time the Central Ecological and Environmental Protection Inspectorate not only reported that Zhangye illegally extracted surface water, but also failed to control over-exploitation of groundwater. &quot;Zhangye City has not implemented the strictest water resources management system in place. Economic development and urban construction have not fully considered the water environment carrying capacity of the Heihe River Basin. The problem of inaction and random actions by some departments is outstanding.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;1,248 acres of artificial The water is involved in &quot;building before approval&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Zhangye Ganzhou is known as &quot;half city of reeds, half city of pagoda shadows&quot;. The name &quot;Lushui Bay&quot; may place its hope on recreating its historical features. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Compared with famous scenic spots such as Zhangye Danxia National Geopark, Lushui Bay is a new attraction. Before 2009, there was no open water landscape here, but rocky beaches, sand pits, stone quarries, and construction waste dumps, all of which were inaccessible. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Looking from the map, Lushuiwan Scenic Area is connected by three artificial lakes.

Song Xiaoyu, associate researcher at the Northwest Institute of Ecological Environment and Resources, Chinese Academy of Sciences, and others have made calculations. In 2011, the average selling price of commercial housing within a 500-meter radius of Zhangye National Wetland Park was 3,232 yuan/square meter, rising to 4,147 yuan/square meter in 2021. square meter, excluding factors such as inflation and infrastructure construction, the landscape value premium of the wetland park is 715 yuan/square meter, and the total added value of the landscape reaches 32 million yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/05/9fed4194bd.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;810&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/05/9fed4194bd.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;260737&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999;&quot;>;Zhangye National Wetland Park.

However, as the core landscape in the Lushui Bay Scenic Area, the artificial water surface was notified by the inspection team as being built before approval. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the staff of Zhangye Water Affairs Bureau, the preliminary procedures involved in the artificial lake include: project approval, construction project land pre-examination opinion, environmental impact report approval, water resources demonstration report approval, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Inspection team members said that almost none of these procedures were completed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A person familiar with the Zhangye Municipal Government told Southern Weekend reporters that the Lushui Bay Scenic Area project did not have a project approval from the development and reform department, and there was no environmental impact assessment of the construction project. &quot;The project approval is a birth certificate, otherwise it is &#39; Black households&#39;&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Lushuiwan Scenic Area, which was built 12 years ago, has not gone through the relevant procedures, which is incredible. “Lushui Bay is so good that everyone is used to it,” said the above-mentioned person familiar with the situation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The artificial water surfaces built before approval in Zhangye are not an isolated case. They also include 11 artificial water surfaces in the Olympic Forest Park (referred to as Orson Park) across the river from Lushui Bay, totaling 1,248 acres. Since the country strengthened the investigation and rectification of &quot;lake digging and landscaping&quot; in June 2020, two artificial lakes have been newly built in Zhangye Ruoshui Park, with a water area of ​​165 acres; the newly built artificial lakes in Baita Rainbow Park and the park on the west side of Zhangye Grand Theater have It also occupied 24.4 acres of cultivated land. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Mine pit turned into park, lack of ecological restoration plan&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Among the artificial water surfaces reported by the inspector, the water intake area of ​​Zhangye Aosen Park is second only to the artificial lake in Lushui Bay Scenic Area, equivalent to half of the latter. Its story is also similar to Lushui Bay: restoration-planting trees-water diversion-development-development of tourism + real estate. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before 2017, the original site of Aosen Park was a deserted Gobi desert with no grass growing on it. There were many large pits left by sand and gravel mining in the sand and gravel factory. The relevant person in charge of the Zhangye Water Conservancy Bureau responded to Southern Weekend Reporters, diverting water from the Heihe River to build artificial water surfaces is an ecological restoration method that “kills two birds with one stone”: the mine pits are treated to prevent seepage and then filled with water, which is low-cost; the water storage can also provide water sources for the surrounding forests. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/05/a36244a7a3.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;810&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/05/a36244a7a3.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;260738&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999;&quot;>;Zhangye Olympic Forest Park.

According to its plan, it attempts to create an ecological leisure and health gathering area integrating tourism, health care, sports and entertainment. Aosen Park not only plans to build distribution plazas, sports fields and parking lots, but also supports Shenkeng Hotel, Heihe Water Ecology Museum, Forest Health Care Community, Forest Sports Town, etc. The investment is estimated to reach 2.86 billion yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Inspection team members believe that these mines should develop tailor-made ecological restoration plans in accordance with relevant national management regulations and scientifically demonstrate their ecological impact. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the person in charge of the Ganzhou District Heihe Forestry Farm, the unit responsible for the Osun Park project, said frankly that how to repair the more than 40 mine pits, whether to cover them with soil and then plant grass and trees, or to prevent seepage and then fill them with water , and no ecological restoration plan has been carried out independently. Finally, depending on factors such as the topography of the mine pit, some cover the area with soil and then plant trees, while others do anti-seepage and then inject water. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Why not apply for a water abstraction permit? &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Open the satellite map on your mobile phone. The green Zhangye is surrounded by the yellow Gobi Desert. Pieces of agate-like blue water are embedded in the territory of Zhangye. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhangye is not rich in water resources. Zhangye has a temperate arid climate, with annual precipitation of only 100-250 mm, but annual evaporation as high as 1400-2700 mm.

The water in the main canals has obtained a water abstraction permit. The water consumption of the artificial water surface in Lushui Bay is increased by the main canals. The water consumption for agricultural irrigation does not exceed the total water permit. However, members of the inspection team said that the permitted use of water in the main canal is limited to agricultural irrigation, and the artificial water surface in the Lushui Bay Scenic Area is ecological water and does not comply with the water abstraction permit requirements. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Not only does Lushui Bay Scenic Area not have a water permit. The inspector reported that Zhangye Ruoshui Huahai Scenic Area has not applied for a water abstraction license from 2016 to 2021. After applying for a new license in 2022, it still drew an excess of 67,000 cubic meters of water from the Heihe River. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/05/3580c4d48a.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;810&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/05/3580c4d48a.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;260740&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999;&quot;>;Zhangye Ruoshuihuahai Scenic Area.

According to the Heihe River water diversion plan determined by the State Council in 1997, about 60% of the water volume was released downstream. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The relevant person in charge of the Zhangye Water Affairs Bureau said that since August 2000, Zhangye City has continuously completed the water diversion tasks from the Heihe River. Especially in 2023, the precipitation will be 20% less than in previous years, and the annual runoff will be dry. However, The discharge task has still been exceeded, and the downstream Dongjuyan Sea has not dried up since 2004. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, relevant people believe that Zhangye’s arid climate, high evaporation, and illegal construction of artificial water surfaces in the city have exacerbated water shortages. The performance may not be obvious during the wet season, but in recent years the Heihe River runoff has been relatively dry, which has already revealed ecological risks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/05/e391ba7df0.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;551&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/05/e391ba7df0.png&quot; data-key=&quot;260741&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999;&quot;>;The artificial water surface in the Lushui Bay Scenic Area contrasts sharply with the dry Heihe River bed next to it. Screenshot of the video of the inspection team&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Gansu Provincial Hydrological Station introduced that since 2003, the Heihe River has entered a rare 18-year continuous wet season. Song Xiaoyu said that according to data from the Yingluoxia Hydrological Station in the upper reaches of the Heihe River, the multi-year average runoff entering the middle reaches is about 1.58 billion cubic meters. The average annual runoff from 2005 to 2020 exceeded 2 billion cubic meters, reaching a peak of 23.5 in 2017. One hundred million cubic meters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ejina Banner in the lower reaches of the Heihe River feels the greatest changes in water volume. According to &quot;Ban Yue Tan&quot;, from 2016 to 2020, the number of days when rivers in Ejina Banner were closed was reduced from the previous average of 250 days to 55 days. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the runoff of the Heihe River has decreased in recent years. According to the Gansu Provincial Hydrological Station, the runoff during the 2023 dispatch period is only 1.38 billion cubic meters, less than 60% of the peak. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past three years, the Ejina oasis ecology, which has already improved, has begun to &quot;cry thirsty&quot; again. Data provided by the Alxa League Water Conservancy Bureau to &quot;Half Moon Talk&quot; shows: Since 2020, the Ejina in the Heihe River Basin has The number of flow-free days in this section has been around 100 for three consecutive years. On May 20, 2022, the entire Ejina section of the Heihe River Basin was cut off. The East Juyan Sea has not received water supply for more than 10 months.

For example, in the first three quarters of 2023, respectively Year-on-year decreases of 0.39, 0.26, and 0.81 meters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Historically, due to long-term large-scale extraction of groundwater, Zhangye City has formed 7 over-exploitation areas, all of which are restricted mining areas. The &quot;Groundwater Management Regulations&quot; stipulate that the provincial water conservancy department, in conjunction with the natural resources and other departments, organizes the delineation of groundwater prohibited and restricted areas within the administrative region. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The inspector also reported that since 2020, thousands of excessive water withdrawal problems have occurred in Zhangye&#39;s over-mining area, and the local water affairs department has basically failed to investigate and deal with them in accordance with the law. In the restricted mining area, 160 million cubic meters of groundwater was used beyond the permitted limit. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In an interview with a Southern Weekend reporter, the relevant person in charge of the Zhangye City Water Affairs Bureau said that although some water wells drew more groundwater than allowed, other wells drew less water than allowed, and the total amount of groundwater drawn in the region was not. Exceeds total permitted range. The reason why there are no administrative penalties for thousands of excessive water withdrawals is because the local government implements a tiered water price mechanism. After exceeding the permitted water use, higher water fees can be charged and adjusted through market mechanisms. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, relevant analysts believe that this move is suspected of &quot;selling water&quot; and is not conducive to the management of groundwater overexploitation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2012, the State Council&#39;s &quot;Opinions on Implementing the Strict Water Resources Management System&quot; required that &quot;in areas where groundwater is over-exploited, new withdrawals of groundwater from agriculture, industrial construction projects and service industries are prohibited.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The inspector reported that since 2016, the local water department has illegally approved 20 wells including Zhiyuan Forestry Technology Co., Ltd. In January 2016, the Gansu Provincial Department of Water Resources required that all self-provided water wells within the coverage of the public water supply network be closed in 2016. Not only did Zhangye City fail to implement the relevant requirements, it even issued water abstraction licenses for 49 wells of enterprises in the Economic Development Zone. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporters noticed that the groundwater data provided by the relevant authorities in Zhangye City are confusing and contradictory. The 2015 groundwater water consumption data provided by the Municipal Water Affairs Bureau to the inspection team differed by more than 46 million cubic meters from the data provided to reporters. Southern Weekend reporters asked the Municipal Water Affairs Bureau for the reason, but as of press time, no reply has been received. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The inspector stated that this was not an isolated case. During the inspection process, due to the prominent cases of misreporting, concealment and false reporting by relevant competent authorities, the workload of on-site verification was greatly increased. For example, the inspection team reviewed the list of self-provided water wells covered by Zhangye City’s public water supply pipe network. The Municipal Water Affairs Bureau only provided a list of Ganzhou District, including the water wells of three companies. However, the inspection team went to the Economic Development Zone in Ganzhou District for on-site inspection and found that there were 49 water wells in dozens of companies. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Water conservation requires institutional reform&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In winter, the Heihe River enters the dry season. When driving on the Zhangye Heihe River Bridge, the river bed under the bridge has dried up, exposing yellow soil and gray sand and gravel. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/05/3196d705e1.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;810&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/05/3196d705e1.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;260743&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999;&quot;>;At the end of November 2023, in the Zhangye Heihe River section in winter, some rivers had dried up. Photo by Southern Weekend Lin Fangzhou&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The per capita water resource in Zhangye City is only 1,250 cubic meters, which is 60% of the national average. As a large agricultural city, the average water quantity per mu is only 511 cubic meters, which is only 60% of the national average. Thirty percent. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhangye’s water resource shortage is inseparable from its economic structure. In 2022, Zhangye&#39;s three industrial structure ratios will be 29.3:20.4:50.3, with agriculture accounting for a larger proportion of the economy than industry. Agricultural water accounts for about 90% of the city’s water use. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Thanks to climatic advantages such as long sunshine hours and large temperature differences between day and night, Zhangye is rich in high-quality agricultural products. The &quot;Wujiang tribute rice&quot;, which has been famous since the Tang Dynasty because the rice grains do not stick together after being cooked, has been significantly reduced due to the water-saving rice planting area. On the large tracts of farmland near Lushuiwan Scenic Area and Aosen Park, billboards proclaiming &quot;100,000 acres of vegetable base for Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao&quot; were erected. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The seasonal distribution of water resources in the Heihe River is uneven, and the timing of incoming water and agricultural water use is not completely coordinated. Song Xiaoyu told Southern Weekend reporters that the Heihe River water resources come from glaciers, frozen soil, snowmelt water and rainfall. The precipitation is mainly concentrated from July to September, and from March to June when agricultural water is most urgent, 60 to 70% The water needs to be supplied by glaciers, frozen soil, and melted snow. Winter snowfall and snow contribute 20%-25% of the water source to the Heihe River runoff in the second year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Song Xiaoyu said that Zhangye, located in high latitudes and high altitudes, is a sensitive area greatly affected by climate change. The temperature is increasing at a faster rate. The glacier area has decreased by about 20% in the past 50 years, and the snow line is also rising. From October to December 2022, the snowfall in Shandan, Minle and Sunan counties in Zhangye was 70% less than the average of the past ten years. The decrease in surface runoff has also led to an increase in groundwater withdrawals. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Under such economic, social and climatic conditions, Zhangye urgently needs to further improve water resource utilization. Song Xiaoyu believes that Zhangye City has gone through long-term exploration of water-saving work, and the current irrigation efficiency is already at a high level. The next step is to make breakthroughs in institutional mechanisms, such as further deepening the reform of agricultural water rights and water prices, improving the water rights trading system, and continuing to promote High-standard farmland construction, accelerating industrial structure adjustment, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Song Xiaoyu and others have conducted research on Ganzhou District of Zhangye City and found that optimizing the water rights allocation model, high-standard farmland construction and industrial structure adjustment can respectively increase the comprehensive carrying capacity of water resources by up to 1.87%. , 8.72% and 3.06%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“For local authorities, institutional reform faces many challenges such as funding, technology, and talent. However, in order to continue to optimize water resource management and improve water resource utilization efficiency, this work is imperative. .&quot; Song Xiaoyu said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 05 Dec 2023 15:25:05 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[裁判文书里出现“安徽省南京市”？深圳福田法院通报]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261903]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-12-05 15:05:01&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Situation Report&lt;br>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Recently, some media pointed out Our court has corrected the misstatement of &quot;Nanjing City, Anhui Province&quot; in the enforcement ruling.
