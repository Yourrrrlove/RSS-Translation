The banner of &quot;Blue Sky Rescue&quot; often causes brand controversies. Pictures and texts are irrelevant. Visual China Map&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The same uniforms are also called the &quot;Shanghai Blue Sky Rescue Team&quot; by the outside world. These days, two &quot;Blue Sky Rescue Teams&quot; that do not recognize each other have appeared on Shanghai Nanhui New Town Beach. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the staff of the Shanghai Blue Sky Emergency Rescue Service Center (hereinafter referred to as the Shanghai Blue Sky Rescue Center), after a 4 and a half year old girl in Shanghai was lost on the beach on the evening of October 4, 2023, they were rescued the next day. Received search and rescue requests from family members. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, on October 7, the center announced that the rescue team &quot;originally planned to carry out a search and rescue mission tonight, but it was suspended due to some reasons.&quot; The statement also stated that any subsequent activities carried out at the rescue site in the name of &quot;Shanghai Blue Sky Rescue Team&quot; will have nothing to do with it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The next day, another team &quot;BSR Blue Sky Rescue&quot; with the &quot;Blue Sky Rescue&quot; logo also released news to the media, saying that the above statement was issued by another group of people without authorization and did not represent the Blue Sky Rescue Team. Officially, the Blue Sky Rescue Team has been searching and rescuing the 4-year-old girl at the scene and has not stopped. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporters discovered that behind the conflict between the two parties was the &quot;separation&quot; dispute between Blue Sky Rescue Team that lasted for several years. Zhang Yong, the founder of Blue Sky Rescue Team, and Cao Weiwei, the current legal representative of Beijing Blue Sky Rescue, both advocated The legitimacy of himself and the &quot;Blue Sky Rescue Team&quot; - the &quot;Blue Sky&quot; brand, has become the focus of competition between the two parties. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Simultaneous search and rescue&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;A staff member of the Shanghai Blue Sky Rescue Center told Southern Weekend reporters that on October 5, they were entrusted by their families to go to Nanhui New City Beach to carry out search and rescue, and they The search and rescue operation was reported to the Pudong New Area Emergency Management Bureau. &quot;After dark, we also use drones (lighting search and rescue).&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The staff member did not reveal the specific reason for the evacuation on the 7th: &quot;It&#39;s not convenient to say, I just evacuated that area.&quot; At present, &quot;the government has been conducting search and rescue operations.&quot; But the staff member also said that he had also seen other &quot;Blue Sky Rescue Team&quot; at the search and rescue site in the past two days. &quot;The other party started to think that we were together, but I said no. He also wondered, why is there another Blue Sky (rescue team)?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The staff member said angrily that at some disaster sites before, Some rescue teams will carry out operations under the name of &quot;Blue Sky Rescue Team&quot;, some will raise funds in WeChat groups, but the payee will be a personal account, and some will charge a fee to kill, so that they have to report to the police. Report the crime. &quot;When doing charity, do charity well. If you are really capable, don&#39;t use other people&#39;s names.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There was indeed another &quot;Blue Sky Rescue Team&quot; involved in the rescue at the scene. On the afternoon of October 9, He Dongping told Southern Weekend reporters that as the captain of the Shanghai Mobile Blue Sky Rescue Team, he had been involved in the search and rescue of the girl from the 5th to the 9th, entrusted by the family, and the search and rescue is still ongoing. He Dongping introduced that he is also a member of the &quot;BSR Blue Sky Rescue&quot; mentioned above. &quot;BSR&quot; is the English abbreviation of Blue Sky Rescue Team. However, he had a &quot;bad opinion&quot; about the evacuation of another team, the Shanghai Blue Sky Rescue Center, from the search and rescue site. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Qichacha information shows that the Shanghai Blue Sky Emergency Rescue Service Center was established in July 2014, and its legal representative is Yang Chunming. For a long time, this was the only social organization registered as Blue Sky Rescue in Shanghai until 2023. On September 21, 2019, a private, non-enterprise organization named &quot;Shanghai Baoshan Blue Sky Rescue Team&quot; was registered and established. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He Dongping introduced that Shanghai Baoshan Blue Sky Rescue Team is the name they registered with the civil affairs department. Shanghai Mobile Blue Sky Rescue Team, Shanghai Blue Sky Rescue Team, Shanghai Qingpu Blue Sky Rescue Team and Shanghai College Student Blue Sky Rescue Team are all The team under its jurisdiction. On weekdays, these four teams are coordinated by an internal organization called the &quot;Shanghai Blue Sky Rescue Coordination Center&quot;, and each team carries out rescue work according to different functions and regions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He Dongping said that the brands of the four &quot;Blue Sky Rescue&quot; teams in Shanghai were authorized from the Beijing Blue Sky Rescue Team. He and his teammates have been doing search and rescue for many years under the name &quot;Blue Sky Rescue Team&quot; before. However, before 2023, the local civil affairs department cannot register non-governmental organizations ending with the word &quot;team&quot;. &quot;In order to justify their name,&quot; they officially registered in 2023. The civil affairs department registered as the &quot;Blue Sky Rescue Team&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He Dongping believes that although the Shanghai Blue Sky Rescue Center has exactly the same costumes as them, in fact, &quot;the authorization given to them was canceled many years ago.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to He Dongping, the search and rescue scene was stormy and the waves were strong. Staff from government departments once came to them to verify which team was the real Blue Sky Rescue Team, as well as the team’s skills and equipment. “We told them truthfully. After that, I asked them to leave.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Competing for &quot;Blue Sky Rescue&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;However, Southern Weekend reporters discovered that the Shanghai Blue Sky Rescue Center is also a private non-enterprise organization registered with the civil affairs department. The difference between them is actually that they belong to different blue sky rescue systems. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The list of Shanghai Blue Sky Rescue Center and its team members is listed on the website &quot;Blue Sky Rescue Information Disclosure Platform&quot;; the list of personnel of the four blue sky rescue teams including the Shanghai Mobile Blue Sky Rescue Team is posted on the website &quot;Blue Sky Rescue .China” on. Through the domain name retrieval system and Tianyancha, the owners of the above two domain names are Chi Xiang, the legal representative of Guangdong Blue Sky Rescue Team, and He Dongping, the legal representative of Shanghai Little Savior Technology Co., Ltd. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The information published on the &quot;Blue Sky Rescue Information Disclosure Platform&quot; shows that Zhang Yong is the commander-in-chief of the Blue Sky Rescue Team; &quot;Blue Sky Rescue. China&quot; shows that Cao Weiwei is the person in charge and captain of the brand management of the Blue Sky Rescue Team . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2010, the country&#39;s earliest Blue Sky Rescue Team was registered with the Beijing Civil Affairs Bureau, becoming China&#39;s first private, non-enterprise rescue team with independent legal person qualifications. Zhang Yong, who proposed the establishment of the Blue Sky Rescue Team, has long served as the legal representative of the Beijing Blue Sky Rescue Team (hereinafter referred to as &quot;Beijing Blue Sky&quot;). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/b3e2a93676.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;488&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/b3e2a93676.png&quot; data-key=&quot;253789&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p >;&lt;img alt=&quot;Two different national blue sky rescue platforms.

Internet screenshot&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, in 2020, Beijing Blue Sky’s board members underwent drastic changes. According to the minutes of the Beijing Blue Sky Rescue Team board of directors released by the WeChat public account &quot;BJBSR&quot; (the name of the public account at the time was &quot;Beijing Blue Sky Rescue Team&quot;), on July 27 of that year, Zhang Yong resigned as captain and legal representative at the board meeting. position, the board of directors also elected Cao Weiwei as vice chairman and legal representative. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But Zhang Yong later did not admit the authenticity of the meeting minutes. According to the China Judgment Documents Network, Zhang Yong once filed a lawsuit against Beijing Lantian regarding the minutes of the board of directors that &quot;expelled&quot; him, requesting that the four meeting minutes be found to be invalid. Zhang Yong claimed that Cao forged the signature on the minutes of the board of directors. However, the court believed that the evidence submitted by Zhang Yong was insufficient to prove his claim and ruled that Zhang Yong lost the case. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since then, the WeChat public account &quot;Yuanshan Shuo&quot; has become the account actually operated by Zhang Yong. On December 23, 2020, &quot;Yuanshan Theory&quot; explained the whole incident, saying that Beijing Lantian discovered huge financial loopholes during its audit at the beginning of that year. After investigation, the target was Cao Weiwei, who was the captain of the Beijing Blue Sky Rescue Team at the time, and it was decided to expel Cao Weiwei from the Blue Sky Rescue System. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But Zhang Yong ended up being the one who was &quot;fired&quot;. In February 2022, the legal representative of Beijing Blue Sky was changed to Cao Weiwei. In April of the same year, Zhang Yong posted a video on &quot;Yuanshan Shuo&quot;. In the video, he was wearing a dark blue uniform of the Blue Sky Rescue Team. He raised many questions about Cao Weiwei, who had served as his assistant, saying that he was seeking personal gain. By stealing official seals, forging materials, etc., the legal representative of Beijing Lantian was registered as an individual. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On May 31, 2023, the official WeChat public account of the &quot;Beijing Blue Sky Rescue Team&quot; issued a statement announcing the removal of Chairman Zhang Yong, the removal of director positions and expulsion from the team, and the election of Cao Weiwei as Chairman. On October 1, the public account issued another statement explaining that the reason why Zhang Yong was fired from Beijing Blue Sky was &quot;violation of discipline.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Cao Weiwei explained to Southern Weekend reporters that there were many reasons for expelling Zhang Yong, including &quot;personal issues&quot; and his self-proclaimed &quot;captain&quot; who violated relevant regulations that social groups cannot be managed vertically. &quot;To put it bluntly, he is doing it outside with other people now.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Relationship between the headquarters and local teams&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Behind the above disputes are Beijing&#39;s &quot;Blue Sky Headquarters&quot; and Blue Sky Rescue in various places. &quot;Brand licensing&quot; relationship between teams. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;China&#39;s private rescue teams were originally composed of outdoor sports enthusiasts. After experiencing the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake and the 2010 Yushu earthquake, the private rescue force gradually developed into a large scale. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Regulations on the Registration and Management of Social Groups&quot; stipulates that social groups are not allowed to establish regional branches. Therefore, both Zhang Yongfang and Cao Weifang have stated that there is no hierarchical affiliation between the more than 2,000 registered Blue Sky Rescue Teams and Beijing Blue Sky. However, the Beijing Blue Sky dispute will still affect other Blue Sky rescue teams across the country through some intangible assets. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In April 2021, &quot;BJBSR&quot; stated that the &quot;Blue Sky Rescue Information Disclosure Platform&quot; that the National Blue Sky Rescue Team has used for several years has belonged to Chi Xiang&#39;s personal company, and Beijing Blue Sky terminated its cooperation with Chi Xiang in 2020 . Currently, Beijing Blue Sky holds the copyright and patent rights of the Blue Sky Rescue Team, which are well-known to the public, such as the &quot;BSR Blue Sky Rescue Round Logo&quot;, BSR Square Logo, and Blue Sky Team Uniforms. Information about Zhang Yong&#39;s Blue Sky Rescue Team is disclosed through the &quot;Blue Sky Rescue Information Disclosure&quot; Published through channels such as &quot;Platform&quot; and &quot;Yuanshan Shuo&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the evening of September 30, &quot;Yuanshan Shuo&quot; announced that the Blue Sky Rescue Team would change the VI logo system and rescue phone number. Many Blue Sky teams from various places, including the Shanghai Blue Sky Emergency Rescue Service Center, responded one after another. The next day, the &quot;Beijing Blue Sky Rescue Team&quot; issued a response stating that &quot;the relevant signs and logos of the Blue Sky Rescue Team have not been updated or changed&quot; and once again emphasized that Zhang Yongshi was &quot;fired&quot; and &quot;removed&quot; from Beijing Blue Sky for &quot;violating discipline&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before the &quot;separation&quot;, in 2014, Blue Sky Rescue Team formulated the &quot;Fuyang Convention&quot; and established the brand licensing model of &quot;Blue Sky Rescue&quot;. Beijing Blue Sky is the brand holder and maintains the national system through the structure of &quot;Beijing Team-Provincial Brand Supervisors-Local Blue Sky Teams&quot;. Any locality that is willing to form a team will submit an application, and Beijing Blue Sky will send a liaison officer to review and inspect the application. Those who meet the Blue Sky team building standards will be approved to form a team. Beijing Blue Sky authorizes it to use the name and logo of the Blue Sky Rescue Team, and sets up &quot;brand supervisors&quot; in each province, who are responsible for supervising whether the Blue Sky Rescue Team in each province carries out activities in accordance with the system stipulated by Beijing Blue Sky. If it fails, it will be removed. Local teams have the obligation to implement the various management systems of the Blue Sky Rescue Team and adhere to the development philosophy. However, people, finances, and materials are independently managed by the local rescue teams. The headquarters does not interfere with the regular operations of each team in normal times. It only requires that when conducting unified rescue. The unit obeys the dispatch and command of the headquarters and frontline headquarters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past ten years since then, the Blue Sky Rescue System has developed rapidly across the country. Some teams and personnel have chosen to withdraw, and more volunteers want to join. But from the actual legal status, the Blue Sky headquarters is equal to the Blue Sky teams across the country. Zhang Yong once explained that private rescue teams can register with the local civil affairs department to become a &quot;certain blue sky rescue&quot; organization. If this team does not want to join the blue sky rescue system after registration, or has withdrawn from the blue sky rescue system, it can still continue to use it. The registered name of &quot;Blue Sky Rescue&quot;. When they carry out activities, they do not need to assign tasks through the headquarters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Cao Weiwei explained to Southern Weekend reporters that &quot;brand management&quot; is a kind of intentional cooperation. Unified trademarks and team uniforms are for resource sharing and common ideas among different team members. In addition, Beijing Blue Sky cannot restrict the behavior of teams from various places through other means, &quot;it all depends on the spirit of volunteerism.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But some civilian rescue team staff have different perspectives. Li Yanzhao, an early member of the Blue Sky Rescue Team and captain of the Qingdao Red Cross Rescue Team, analyzed to Southern Weekend reporters that many private rescue teams need &quot;Blue Sky&quot; because it has a high social reputation. Relying on this &quot;brand&quot;, many times they can &quot;protect yourself&quot;. Li Yanzhao left the Blue Sky Rescue Team in his early years because he disagreed with the Fuyang Convention. In his opinion, compared with the unified &quot;Blue Sky&quot; brand, what the private rescue team actually needs most is &quot;professional and standardized operation and rescue.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 11 Oct 2023 20:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[入职三天因“氛围不好”走人：要分清是公司不行还是自己不适应]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258393]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-11 19:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Recently, a post viewed by more than 5 million people on the Internet has aroused heated discussion: A young man has been working for three days because of the atmosphere of the unit. It’s not easy to leave your job. As soon as this topic came up, countless netizens started a heated debate on the working atmosphere and salary and benefits: some said that the working atmosphere is very important and is the bottom line of being a human being; some believed that working is just to make money, and as long as the treatment is good, you should endure it. Just have to endure it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Whether the working atmosphere or salary is more important is a matter of opinion. There is no unified standard answer. But everyone should pay attention: the working atmosphere cannot be defined simply as &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot;. The key is whether it suits you personally. When considering whether you are suitable or not, you cannot rely on your own vague feelings, but must have measurable standards, such as: industry prospects, company development, leadership ability and charm, teamwork, nature of work, job division, your own suitability, and Salary level. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If it is a sunset industry, a company that lacks a future, a strong bureaucracy, widespread flattery, team intrigues, a depressing working atmosphere, fierce competition and other truly bad operating conditions, there is nothing wrong with choosing to leave. And habitat. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But if the industry is booming, the company has a good future, the company is full of vigor, the leadership and business backbones are strong, the teamwork is close, the relationship between colleagues is harmonious, the competition is fierce but the system is fair, and rewards and punishments are clear... it&#39;s just that It is not good to easily give up a hard-won offer based on some vague feelings because you are temporarily unsuitable, unable to keep up with the rhythm, and your self-esteem is temporarily frustrated. After all, it is difficult to fully and objectively understand a company and related industries after only a few days of employment. Frequent employment and resignation within a short period of time will also have a negative impact on an individual&#39;s credibility in the workplace. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;More than 20 years ago, when I was young, I had several experiences of leaving my job quickly after a short time in the job. This was because I felt that the company was small, the equipment was backward, and the business it undertook was also small. The lower end is not good for your future. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Later, I had the opportunity to join a 4A advertising company. I was very frustrated at first. The working atmosphere was not good. The &quot;senior creative&quot; was unwilling to teach a new &quot;design assistant&quot; like me. The creative director (Creative Director) was basically Don&#39;t look at me seriously. However, seeing so many award-winning works in the company, the advertising agencies of large companies, the profound insights of CDs and SCs in analyzing problems during meetings, and the many Apple &quot;Macintosh&quot; graphics workstations in the creative department... I feel that I am lucky to be in the company. As long as people don’t forcefully kick me out of this prestigious creative enterprise, I must stay and learn all their skills. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Later, when I became the creative director, I also faced the problem of new employees leaving within a few days of joining. The reason was: I felt that the big brothers and sisters in the company did not respect them enough. This new employee was in school. He had served as a cadre of the student union at that time, and other classmates were probably polite to him and were used to it. Suddenly he entered a company and became the bottom of the team. The psychological gap was too big. This is not a &quot;bad atmosphere&quot; in the company, but a &quot;bad mentality&quot; on his part. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A HR friend from a headhunting company once said to me: Do you plan to be a part-time worker for a long time, or will you be able to do it yourself in the future? The way you deal with it in the workplace is different. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If you plan to be a part-time worker for a long time and eventually become a professional manager, then in the early stages of your career experience, you should change jobs frequently to enrich your experience and look for opportunities as much as possible. As you gradually mature, you will need to slow down the frequency of job changes in order to accumulate your own workplace personality. Because the headhunting market is now all connected to the Internet, the boss and the board of directors have increasingly strict requirements on the workplace ethics of senior managers. The previous &quot;meritocracy&quot; has gradually developed into &quot;both ability and political integrity&quot;. In the early days of starting a business, I was still rampant in an immature market, so of course I advocated &quot;meritocracy&quot;. Now, as those with successful careers are getting older, they have to consider whether their foundation will be passed on to the &quot;second or third generation&quot; in the future. Therefore, their employment methods have also begun to select harvest-type talents to avoid &quot;restless&quot; talents. People rise to the top. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If you plan to do it yourself in the future, you must find a company that is large enough and complex enough, fully understand how an industry operates, how a company operates, and understand the market and people in the workplace. How do you survive? The focus is on observing the market, understanding people&#39;s hearts, and understanding human nature, not &quot;working atmosphere&quot; or &quot;salary benefits.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This HR friend also believes that &quot;college students&quot; should be cautious when starting a business. If they have just graduated from college and do not understand the market and have no insight into human nature, they will go into debt to start a business and even use up their parents&#39; pension. That&#39;s not good. Tens of millions of college students graduate every year around the world. How many Jobs and Musks are there? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;College students should find employment first. Even if they change jobs a few times, experience some things in the world, get a preliminary understanding of the market, get in touch with complex human nature, and then start their own business, the probability of success will be higher. Even so, we do not advocate &quot;resigning after three days of employment&quot;, because in three days, you can&#39;t learn anything, you can&#39;t understand anything, and you can&#39;t even find out what problems the company has. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 11 Oct 2023 19:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[往事琐忆丨人来人往]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258391]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-11 18:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/11/EsoGMZ7gxCvPcnc1mEkEuGnUkMgCc7JAfXCjhMRQ.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;539&quot; height=&quot;800&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/EsoGMZ7gxCvPcnc1mEkEuGnUk MgCc7JAfXCjhMRQ. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253655&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Campbell Soup cans. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Green Leaves&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Car driving on Prince Edward Road, Kowloon , during the afternoon rush hour, it was suddenly blocked. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is nothing to do at this time, so I have to calm down. There is no way to advance or retreat anyway, so why be upset? Looking outside the car, there are trees on both sides, and all kinds of trees are fluttering in the wind under the sun. There are large clumps of green leaves with varying shapes, some pointed, some round, &amp;nbsp;some long, some short. Probably no one would pay attention to green leaves in normal times. Only in this season when there are no flowers to enjoy, only when the heat is overwhelming and you happen to be in an air-conditioned car, can you enjoy them so easily. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The leaves, lush and small, swayed in the wind. Under the sunlight, they flickered in the sun, as if thousands of small mirrors were vying for beauty. How many times have I passed by this scene? Why do I always turn a blind eye to this scene? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As people grow up, there are many times when they turn a blind eye and turn a blind eye. The rigid daily rhythm has dulled the once sharp mind, and it is no longer possible to feel the subtle and wonderful gifts in life. I don’t know how to cherish everything I have, nor do I think it will be lost in an instant. I always think that everything is inevitable. What is there today will still be there tomorrow. When it is lost in an instant, I am shocked to realize why I didn&#39;t take advantage of it in the first place. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The greenery outside the window reminds me of the years when I was studying in Taiwan when I was young. Materials were really scarce at that time, and broken appliances were repaired again and again; watches had to be worn for a lifetime; there were only three or two pieces of clothing, and they were passed down from brother to brother and from sister to sister. Still, it was a good time. For example, when we were in art class, the teacher often taught us to be ingenious, develop our creativity, and create magnificent and colorful pictures with limited materials. Once, let us draw leaves. The method is to first go to the wild to collect all kinds of green leaves, and then lay out the various leaves on white drawing paper according to your own preference, then cut out a piece of the old screen window to use as a sieve, and lightly paint it with dark and light watercolors. The colors pass through the fine grid and fall on the painting paper like rain and dew. Then the green leaves were uncovered one after another, and each time they were painted with different colors. Finally, a masterpiece with vivid patterns and brilliant colors was finally formed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since then, I have fallen in love with leaves. I like to look at flowers and don’t forget to admire leaves. At that time, I lived in a large courtyard on Heping East Road in Taipei. There were several simple bungalows built in the courtyard, and several families lived there. The martial arts novelist Gu Long also lived there when he was a child. He didn&#39;t like to study and only wanted to write novels. , everyone called him &quot;the son of the Xiong family&quot;. In the middle of the yard is a public open space where chickens are raised and dogs are let out. The remaining narrow corners are filled with some inconspicuous flowers and plants. I don&#39;t know who planted them. There is an oleander tree next to the public toilet. It has bright pink flowers, pointed and long leaves, dark green leaves and light green backs. Several canna plants were planted beside the ditch, some red and some yellow, with egg-elliptical leaves. Although the variety is ordinary, it has swayed in the morning and sunset, adding a lot of interest to life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Taipei at that time, there was a lot of farmland and greenery everywhere. Before moving to Dazayuan, I lived in a place called &quot;Liuzhangli&quot; (what a pastoral name). There was only a fence between the residence and the large farmland. The fence is covered with morning glories. Every sunrise, the purple flowers are in full bloom, resembling trumpets, and the leaves are tender and green, smiling and waving in the morning breeze. No wonder this flower is called Morning Glory in English. In that rice field, you can see buffaloes working hard and farmers working hard all year round. Speaking of green, there is no more beautiful scene than the beautiful spring seedlings and the green color that fills the eyes! &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the way home from school, I often see piles of large green leaves on the streets and in puddles, similar in shape to lotus leaves, but I have never seen a lotus flower in bloom. When I asked an adult, I found out that they were taro leaves. Although taro leaves are ordinary, it turns out that this leaf has a special feature. Whenever it rains, the falling raindrops are sprinkled on the leaf surface, and they will condense into water droplets, rolling back and forth, just like diamonds. When the sun shines after the rain, It looks even more dazzling. I remember once I wrote this scenery into a composition &quot;After the Rain&quot;, which was greatly praised by my class teacher (called a grade teacher in Taiwan) Chen Wenbin. This inspired my love for words, and thus I embarked on a career in literature and translation in the future. the way. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many years later, when I returned to Paris, I was introduced by a friend to the works of French painter Chen Jianzhong. He was good at painting all kinds of leaves. The green leaves in each picture were crystal clear and glowed with the brilliance of life. , exciting. It&#39;s a pity that I didn&#39;t have enough money to buy a treasure back then, and now I can&#39;t even afford the astronomical current price. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;No matter! Just look out and enjoy the greenery outside the window! The layers of green are soothing to the eyes and the mind. I am already very rich and contented. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Canned food&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;When the epidemic is not over and the lockdown is over, I don’t want my Filipino maid to go to the vegetable market often, so just ask her to buy it in the supermarket. As a result, there were more canned soups, luncheon meats, etc. on the table. I usually have no interest in canned food, the only exception being tomato sauce beans. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Every time I go out with my daughter, we always order All Day Breakfast for lunch, and the must-have soybeans in tomato sauce in this dish is my favorite. Whenever my daughter watches me eating beans with gusto, she is always a little puzzled. What is so special about such ordinary food? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sour and sweet, glutinous and crispy, what you taste in your mouth is not just the melt-in-your-mouth feeling of beans in tomato sauce, but also the memory of hard work in your youth. When I was a sophomore in high school, I moved to Hong Kong from Taipei and was lucky enough to be admitted to Pei Ching Middle School. I was unfamiliar with the place and I didn&#39;t know the Cantonese language. I had to take the national college entrance examination a year later. I was caught off guard and I was in a hurry. Fortunately, the whole class did not exclude me, a transfer student from Taiwan. I hung out with everyone every day in school. Within half a year, I could speak Cantonese casually and became as fluent as I am today. At that time, I was only thinking about Taiwan&#39;s university entrance examination. I really didn&#39;t know much about Hong Kong&#39;s high school entrance examination. I only know that my classmates are nervously preparing for the exam, and I am also nervous. There were five or six girls in the class. Some time before the college entrance examination, we would meet from time to time to go back to school on Sundays to review their studies. Mathematics, physics and chemistry were the highlight. For a new student like me, having someone to work hard with after school and solve my doubts together was of course a dream. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Life was simple and materially scarce at that time. Five or six young people got together to buy a long loaf of white bread and a can of beans with tomato sauce&amp;nbsp; (This was my first experience with such a thing. canned food), not even soda and juice, so it was our lunch. After reviewing, when my head was dizzy due to the difficult laws of physics, the thorny mathematics problems, and the complexity of biochemical terms, I opened the can, spread the orange soybeans on the white soft bread, and chewed it, but I felt Extremely luscious. I still remember the sour, sweet, crispy and soft fragrance of beans. Along with a cheering gesture and an encouraging look among my classmates, it immediately aroused the feeling of &quot;having the same hatred and the same enemy&quot; in the exam room. A little trouble before the exam, That&#39;s why it was wiped out. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another kind of can is something I can never forget. Before coming to Hong Kong, I studied in Beiyi Girls&#39; School in Taiwan, from the first year of junior high school to the second year of high school. At that time, I lived in a large courtyard on Heping East Road. The landlord&#39;s surname was Yan and he was from Sichuan. Their family has three daughters and three sons. My daughters are all older than me, so after we moved there, I suddenly had three more sisters when I was alone at home. Lucy, the third sister of the Yan family, is a happy girl. She greets everyone with a smile all day long, dances and has many strange thoughts. It was a period of growth at that time. Soon after dinner, my stomach would growl and I couldn&#39;t find anything to eat, so I would follow my third sister around. Lucy said that there is a good way to take the leftover cold rice from dinner and wash it with hot water to turn it into soaked rice. No side dishes, right? Open a can of &quot;Dushan Salt Pickled Cabbage&quot;! &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Dushan Salted Pickled Cabbage&quot; was a famous brand in Taiwan back then. When you open the can, you will be greeted by the aroma of garlic. I don’t know why, maybe it was because I didn’t have any other choice back then! I just remember that every time it was almost midnight, I would hide in the small kitchen with my third sister, top up the hot rice with sour and spicy &quot;Dushan&quot;, and devour it with great joy. My empty stomach would also make me feel incomparable. of satisfaction. Since then, I have fallen in love with peppers and garlic, which seems a bit &quot;deviant&quot; to me as a Shanghainese. However, when I went to Paris to study in the future, I came across &quot;garlic, butter, wine&quot;. For Sanbao’s French cooking, it feels like a fish in water. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When Bei Yi was in junior high school, all students received Scout training. Once, the school asked everyone to go camping, but the camp was not in the countryside, but on the school playground. No matter this, the classmates are still happy and excited. Each class is divided into teams of six or seven people. After each team sets up camp, they have to be responsible for their own cooking. Each team shows off their skills and presents their specialty dishes, which the instructors can taste and rate to compete. I remember that our team had finally set up the tent and was already in a hurry. How could we still have time to cook? In desperation, someone came up with an idea, saying that it would be better to use a magic weapon like &quot;Dushan Salt Pickled Cabbage&quot;! It was almost dusk, and the instructor Shi Shiran came to the field. She may be like the Zao Lord Bodhisattva at the end of the twelfth lunar month. Along the way, she had tried big fish and meat in each team, and her mouth felt a little tired. As soon as she tasted our &quot; &quot;Dushan Salted Pickled Cabbage&quot;, he was so full of praises that he thought it was a supreme delicacy and almost gave us the first prize. This time, everyone was shocked. Isn&#39;t this behavior comparable to cheating in an exam? I no longer remember the result, but this unique experience remains firmly in my mind. I revisited the island many years later and wanted to find a can of &quot;Dushan Salt Pickled Cabbage&quot; in the supermarket. Unfortunately, this brand has long since passed away. As time goes by, the traces of fragrance are gone. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is also a kind of canned chicken that contains boneless chicken. I can’t remember the name. It’s a foreign brand. After graduating from university, he went to the United States to study for a master&#39;s degree. Not long after I arrived, I met Shi, a girl from Taiwan, in the dormitory of Washington University in St. Louis, and the two hit it off. The dormitory provides breakfast and dinner, and you can prepare lunch by yourself. In order to save money, the two of us decided to buy a loaf of white bread every lunch, open a can of boneless chicken, and eat it in my room. Shi is majoring in chemical engineering, and her hand strength is stronger than mine. She can do tasks like opening cans with ease. One day at noon, I went back late. When I entered the unlocked door, I found that the room was quiet and there was no one around. When I looked carefully, I saw a half-opened can on the small table with blood stains on the side. ,&amp;nbsp;A drop of blood first flowed to the ground, and then to the door. This scene was like a murder scene, so scary! I followed the bloodstains and hurriedly ran out. The bloodstains led me through the corridor and towards the room at the other end. When I rushed in, I was surprised to see Shi, who was usually tough, pressing his bloody fingers with a nervous look on his face. , at a loss! We hurried to the medical room, not remembering how many stitches she gave. Years later, whenever I think about the frugal years when I was studying in the United States, and the lifelong innocent friendship between our group of girls, I will accidentally think of this canned boneless chicken! &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Three kinds of cans carry three stages of life, from green to mature. Those years were quiet and peaceful, and we spent ordinary and comfortable days; what about now? The wind is blowing and the rain is blowing, and the weather is unpredictable. Looking at the future in the distance, I am speechless. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 11 Oct 2023 18:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[澳大利亚籍人员成蕾被国家安全机关依法执行驱逐出境]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258395]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-11 17:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;span>;On October 11, 2023, Australian citizen Cheng Lei was detained by Beijing after serving her sentence.

Since the &quot;Yom Kippur War&quot; in 1973, the most serious conflict in 50 years has broken out. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As of October 10, according to the latest news released by Israeli media and Palestinian medical institutions, the conflict has caused more than 1,900 deaths. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Faced with such a large-scale attack, why did Israel, which has always claimed to be the number one military power in the Middle East, not aware of it in advance? As the conflict continues to escalate, this question has also become the focus of international public opinion. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At present, both Israel and the Western media believe that there is a &quot;big problem&quot; in Israel&#39;s proud intelligence system. Hamas said it had been secretly preparing for the attack for more than a year, but that Israeli security and intelligence agencies did not issue any advance warning. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Is the “intelligence myth” shattered? &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The highly security border barrier is covered with Israeli surveillance cameras and guard soldiers. Surveillance drones also appear in the sky from time to time, constantly &quot;buzzing&quot;. This scene has been going on for Palestinians in Gaza for nearly 30 years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But before Hamas launched a new round of attacks, Israel&#39;s intelligence system seemed to &quot;close its eyes.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hamas broke through the Palestinian-Israeli border barrier and sent hundreds of armed personnel to infiltrate into Israeli-controlled areas. Efraim Halevi, the former head of the Israeli intelligence service Mossad, publicly stated that they had not received any form of warning and that &quot;the outbreak of the war was a complete surprise.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;CNN reported that the Gaza Strip is blockaded and closely monitored by the Israeli army, and Palestinian armed personnel are rarely able to enter Israel. But Halevi said the number of rockets fired by Palestinian militants was &quot;unprecedented&quot; and that it was &quot;the first time&quot; they were able to &quot;penetrate deep into Israel and take control of villages.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although Israel is no stranger to Palestinian attacks, this time the Israeli military found itself &quot;unprepared.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“The entire intelligence system failed, it was just one component and failed to provide the necessary defense for Israeli civilians.” said Jonathan Conricks, former international spokesman for the Israel Defense Forces. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since Israel withdrew from Gaza in 2005, it has spent hundreds of millions of dollars building a smart border with sensors and underground walls to protect the border from attacks, Reuters said. The Israeli military also &lt;span>;with the help of the United States developed an &quot;Iron Dome&quot; defense system&lt;/span>; specifically designed to intercept rockets and mortars. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Israeli intelligence agency has been written into a &quot;myth&quot; by domestic and Western media because of a series of &quot;achievements&quot; over the past few decades. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But this time, the &quot;myth&quot; seems to have been shattered by Hamas. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Retired Israeli general Amir Avivi said that militants in Gaza have found ways to evade technical intelligence collection, preventing Israel from fully understanding their intentions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;They have returned to the Stone Age.&quot; Avivi explained that armed personnel do not use phones or computers, but handovers in specialized technical rooms or underground rooms. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Weijian, a researcher at the Foreign Policy Institute of the Shanghai Institutes for International Studies, analyzed to Southern Weekend reporters that although Israel has a complete intelligence system, looking at it conversely, for every set of Israeli practices, the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip The armed forces are also constantly summarizing and taking precautions, and they even have spies in Israel. &quot;It&#39;s entirely possible.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Israel&#39;s &quot;Haaretz&quot; revealed that hundreds of Hamas personnel had been preparing for the raid for months, even more than a year, &quot;but did not leak it&quot;, and the results were obviously disastrous. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Weijian said that by summarizing long-term struggle experience, the Palestinian armed forces may also have grasped some of Israel’s “preventive weaknesses” and found some “preventive rules.” Israel’s military intelligence team cannot be unilaterally assumed So powerful that it is invulnerable. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another point worthy of attention is that Israel’s judicial reforms and political disputes since the beginning of the year have brought about domestic divisions and confrontations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zou Zhiqiang, a researcher at the Middle East Studies Center of Fudan University, told Southern Weekend reporters that the current political instability and internal strife in Israel are higher than in the past, which has distracted Israel&#39;s own attention and energy and weakened morale. Therefore, Israel was unprepared for Hamas&#39;s &quot;innovative, multi-channel&quot; blitz attack. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;All-round attack by land, sea and air&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&quot;Hamas members penetrate from three routes: land, sea and air.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt; p>;Israel Defense Forces spokesman Daniel Hagari said that since 6:30 a.m. local time on October 7, more than 2,200 rockets have been fired from the Gaza Strip towards Israel. At the same time, dozens of armed men stormed the wall, blasting away barricades with explosives and attacking in multiple locations with bulldozers, hang gliders and motorcycles. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zou Zhiqiang believes that from the perspective of an irregular armed organization, Hamas’s operation has an overwhelming advantage. It has caused such a large amount of damage and blow to the tightly defended Israel, which is quite serious from a military perspective. Noteworthy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Judging from the attack method, Hamas armed personnel infiltrated into Israel through multiple channels of sea, land and air. Israeli police stations, settlements and multiple military bases were attacked, and Israeli heavy weapons including main battle tanks and armored vehicles were seized. A large number of Israeli soldiers and ordinary Jewish settlers were captured. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the view of military expert Zhang Xuefeng, the key to Hamas&#39; rapid &quot;results&quot; lies first in the &quot;battle surprise&quot; achieved by Hamas&#39; armed forces. According to Western accounts, Hamas has developed a coordination and communication system that does not rely on electronic systems such as mobile phones, making it impossible for Israeli intelligence agencies to spy on it, while hiding its offensive intentions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, Hamas used drones and missiles to attack Israeli air defense systems and military bases. It also sent submarines and speedboats to penetrate and land on the Israeli coastline, breaking through Israel&#39;s coastal defenses. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Before the raid, Hamas was ready to pay the price.&quot; Zou Zhiqiang said that the armed men who rushed into Israel never thought about going back. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As more details emerge, the outside world increasingly believes that this operation was &quot;well prepared.&quot; A training video released by the &quot;Qassam Brigades&quot;, an armed wing of Hamas, shows that Hamas has long built a simulated Israeli stronghold in Gaza, where its members practice landings and raids. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, Reuters reported that since 2021, Israel has sought to maintain basic stability in the Gaza economy by providing incentives including thousands of licenses. Also in the past two years, Hamas has not taken military action against Israel, which has caused Israel to relax its vigilance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zou Zhiqiang believes that from the perspective of Israel’s long-term strength advantage and reliance on technical means, they may have become lax and have a tired mentality due to their past experience in responding to the Gaza conflict many times. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But in the long run, Zou Zhiqiang said that Hamas may not be able to get Israel to make concessions this time. On the contrary, Israel may intensify its &quot;retaliation.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Copy&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;&quot;The Yom Kippur War&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;? &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;This time Hamas launched a blitzkrieg against Israel on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the &quot;Yom Kippur War&quot; (the Fourth Middle East War). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;October 6 every year happens to be the Jewish &quot;Yom Kippur&quot;. Israel will have a national holiday on that day, suspending all normal activities. On the afternoon of October 6, 1973, Egypt launched an attack on Israel. The Egyptian army forced across the Suez Canal and broke through the Bar-Lev defense line. Israel was caught off guard and faced the danger of national subjugation. Of course, Israel eventually reversed the situation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many Western media have commented that the major mistakes made by Israel and the United States on the intelligence front are comparable to Israel&#39;s performance before the outbreak of the &quot;Yom Kippur War&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before the war, the Egyptian army repeatedly recruited and demobilized reservists, causing Israel to lose its alertness. Active-duty troops frequently moved forward and retreated to cover up military deployments. The war started on the &quot;Yom Kippur&quot; day, which coincided with the Jewish fast, which was not conducive to rapid mobilization. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“There is a certain comparability and a certain correlation between the two.” Zou Zhiqiang believes that Hamas chose the second day of Yom Kippur to carry out a surprise attack. The method of the raid was similar, and Israel was caught off guard. The reaction is quite similar. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many experts and scholars interviewed told Southern Weekend reporters that Hamas&#39;s attack was not only to commemorate the same &quot;secret&quot; operation 50 years ago, but also to take advantage of the fact that that day was Israel&#39;s &quot;Sabbath&quot; , attack him unprepared. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The New York Times believes that although more than half a century has passed since the large-scale war, villages have been occupied again and civilians have been killed or taken hostage, awakening people&#39;s &quot;primitive fears.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zou Zhiqiang said that because the Fourth Middle East War involved Egypt and Syria uniting to attack Israel, it was a large-scale frontal battle between countries. Now Hamas is implementing an asymmetric guerrilla war. The intensity of the battlefield and the confrontation between the two sides cannot be compared with the former. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;What is different from 50 years ago is that the Palestinian-Israeli issue has been marginalized now. This has caused a very disappointing and even desperate mood in Palestine.&quot; Li Weijian believes that under the mixture of various emotions, the Palestinians People hope to make an impactful action by themselves in an attempt to draw the international community&#39;s attention to the Palestinian-Israeli issue again. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;The multi-party game behind the conflict&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The conflict between Palestine and Israel has been going on for a long time. In 2020, the leaders of Israel, the United Arab Emirates, and Bahrain signed the Abraham Accords at the White House, agreeing to normalize bilateral relations and cooperate in economic, technology, security and other fields. The agreement is considered a historic breakthrough in the Middle East. However, countries such as Palestine, Iran, and Turkey oppose and criticize this. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Hamas has always opposed Arab countries to go beyond the Palestinian-Israeli issue and improve relations or establish diplomatic relations with Israel.&quot; Zou Zhiqiang analyzed that the traditional consensus among Arab countries is to resolve the Palestinian-Israeli issue first and then resolve the issue. Arab-Israeli question. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is widespread speculation that Hamas is only a local armed force in the Palestinian Gaza area, and its military strength is very different from that of Israel. Will this &quot;go all out&quot; raid be supported by other countries? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Up to now, countries and organizations such as Iran, Lebanese Hezbollah, Qatar, Kuwait, Iraq, and Syria have publicly spoken out in support of Hamas. Most of these countries have considerable conflicts with Israel and the United States. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The American &quot;Time&quot; magazine believes that Iran has always been the largest single &quot;sponsor&quot; of Hamas. In addition to military training and humanitarian assistance, more than $100 million in military assistance is provided annually. After Hamas launched a raid on Israel, Iran set off fireworks in &quot;public celebration&quot; on the evening of October 7. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hamas spokesman Ghazi Hamad also said in an interview with the British Broadcasting Corporation on October 8 that the organization has received support from its ally Iran and help from &quot;other countries&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, on October 8, the Iranian mission to the United Nations stated in a statement, &quot;We firmly support Palestine. However, we will not participate in Palestine&#39;s actions because this is entirely Palestine&#39;s own decision.&quot; ”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are also many people who side with Israel. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As soon as the conflict broke out, the United States stated that it &quot;will stand with the Israeli people and government.&quot; The White House also specifically stated that the United States will &quot;continue to provide support to Israel, including in-depth intelligence exchanges.&quot; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the US &quot;Time&quot; magazine, the United States provides more than $3 billion in defense assistance to Israel every year, making it the largest recipient of aid, and &quot;it is conceivable that this number may increase.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For a long time, the Middle East has been one of the &quot;core areas&quot; for great power competition. Now that the situation between Palestine and Israel has escalated again, secret games between all parties are indispensable behind the scenes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zou Zhiqiang believes that the conflict will still be limited to Palestine and Israel. In the short term, the Palestinian-Israeli issue may return to the center stage of Middle East diplomacy, but in the long run, it will still be difficult to change its marginalized status. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Weijian believes that if Israel goes on a killing spree and retaliates wildly, causing a large number of deaths, it may intensify internal conflicts in the Middle East. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 9, the spokesperson of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs called for a ceasefire as soon as possible to protect civilians. At the same time, the international community should increase its sense of urgency, increase investment in the Palestinian issue, and make practical efforts to promote the &quot;two-state solution&quot; . &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(Southern Weekend interns Lin Xi and Bao Jingyue also contributed to this article)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p >;</description><pubDate> Wed, 11 Oct 2023 15:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[墙塌压坏菜园成最高法案例，民间调解呼唤“新乡贤”丨快评]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258381]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-11 14:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Recently, the Supreme People’s Court issued a number of typical cases for resolving post-disaster conflicts and disputes. In one of the cases, the courtyard wall of a family in Zhuozhou, Hebei Province collapsed during heavy rain, crushing the neighbor&#39;s vegetable garden. The two parties had a dispute and wanted to go to court. The judge conducted mediation before the lawsuit, and the conflict was finally resolved. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The wall of my yard collapsed and destroyed my neighbor’s vegetable garden. Apart from some vegetables, there was no other major loss. This is a small matter, and in many places, it is possible for the two families to resolve it privately, or to resolve the dispute under the auspices of the village mediator, without going to court. For example, in a village in southeastern Shandong Province, there is an old man in his sixties who is the most senior member of his clan. He is very prestigious because of his eloquence and impartiality. When conflicts and disputes arise between villagers, they are willing to come to him to administer justice. Many disputes were resolved through his mediation. As &quot;Southern Weekend&quot; reported some time ago, &quot;Mazu consultation rooms&quot; set up in many places in Putian, Fujian also played an important role in resolving civil disputes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This kind of mediation mechanism, presided over by local &quot;mediators&quot; and based on the endogenous ethical norms of local society, is one of the important channels for resolving civil disputes. Not long ago, the &quot;Implementation Plan for the &quot;My Hometown, I Build&quot; Activity jointly issued by the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, the National Development and Reform Commission, the Ministry of Civil Affairs, etc. proposed that a group of prestigious and fair-minded returnees should be hired as mediators of neighborhood conflicts to actively Explore working methods such as &quot;package resolution&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Traditionally, Chinese society is a rural society. Most civil disputes in rural areas are resolved through local mediation. Because of the disputes between villagers, most of them were trivial matters such as the Zhang family&#39;s cow eating a few seedlings from the Li family, or the Wang family&#39;s chicken pecking a few vegetables from the Liu family, and the interests involved were not very large. The countryside is made up of acquaintances and even people of the same clan, who have close relationships with each other. In the long-term relationship, a common set of behavioral norms has been formed, which has become the customary law of the village. Those who preside over the mediation are mostly local respected people, either clan leaders, elders, or local sages who have retired and returned to their hometowns. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Most of China&#39;s rural areas live together with ethnic groups. The villagers in many villages are descended from the same ancestors. Of course, there are also some villages where two or more surnames live together, or there are a few families with small surnames. But generally speaking, these villagers have lived together for generations and have developed a way of getting along with each other, and they also have people they believe in in common. Especially within a clan, the patriarch has high authority. When conflicts arise among villagers, most of them are willing to seek their help. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the face of various contradictions and disputes within the village, this kind of mediation is not only a referee, but also a process of reasoning and education. Fei Xiaotong once said in &quot;Country China&quot;, &quot;Mediation is a new term, and the old term is judgment. The so-called mediation in the countryside is actually an educational process.&quot; Therefore, these mediations are often more likely to lead to conflicts than official referees. Most will be implemented voluntarily if all parties are convinced. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, with the rapid social changes and increased population mobility in recent years, the original acquaintance society in rural areas has also begun to become unfamiliar and atomized. It has become difficult to find a &quot;mediator&quot; who is universally convinced by the residents. In some rural areas, especially those on the outskirts of cities, many outsiders come to rent houses. These tenants have no historical connection with the village and are “outsiders” to the village. They often do not fully identify with the original authority in the village. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the other hand, the number of villagers moving out has also increased significantly. Many villagers are away from home all year round and seldom return to the village. The contact with other villagers gradually decreases, and the relationship between clan members and neighbors becomes weaker and weaker. In addition, their long-term experience in stranger societies in other places also makes them more sympathetic to the legal rules of stranger societies, rather than the traditional rules of the countryside and the traditional authority under rural rules. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The defamiliarization and atomization of these two aspects have reduced the prestige of the original authority in rural society, and the function of determining divisions and ending disputes has been continuously weakened. There is no traditional authority that both foreign tenants and local villagers believe in. Villagers who have been away from home for a long time are increasingly less convinced by the elders in the village. As a result, when conflicts arise between foreign tenants and indigenous people, or even disputes among villagers, they are less willing to apply the previous local rules, and are more willing to turn to institutional authorities such as the government and courts for solutions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To rebuild the traditional civil mediation mechanism, it is necessary to find a new &quot;mediator&quot; with sufficient prestige in the community. &quot;Xinxiangxian&quot; is a possible option. Letting these &quot;new rural sages&quot; come forward to uphold justice can often resolve disputes. Compared with the formal judicial process, the social cost is lower. Their mediation is also more likely to be recognized by all parties to the conflict, and the mediation plan is easy to implement. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Even trivial disputes in rural areas are turned to the courts. This can indeed be said to be a &quot;modernization&quot; of the rule of law, but at the same time it dissolves tradition and makes the judicial system unburdened. To give full play to the role of civil mediation in settling disputes and resolving minor conflicts on the spot, it is necessary to rebuild the cohesion of the community and find &quot;Xinxiang wise men&quot; who are familiar and convinced by residents and have considerable modern legal knowledge to act as &quot;mediators.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 11 Oct 2023 14:25:05 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[巴以冲击波里的人]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258379]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-11 12:20:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/11/RNMXhTWmmzgEdNZZYxb1YtlDDqmJIaXkAcSUimk0.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/RNMXhTWmmzgEdNZZYxb1YtlDDqmJIaXkAcSUimk0 . jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253628&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;This is a rocket fired towards Israel taken in the Gaza Strip on October 7. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Xinhua News Agency/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If it were not for the sudden sound of gunfire, October 7, 2023 would have been a pleasant day Saturday. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Tel Aviv, Beijing tourist Liu Zihui will usher in the last day of her National Day trip. According to the plan, she was going to visit the Jewish Museum of Tel Aviv University and then go to the ancient city of Jaffa. In Rehovot, Chinese chef Zhang Feng is getting ready for work. This is the busiest time of the week for Chinese restaurant business. Many Israelis choose this day to go out to eat and relax. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In an area near the Gaza Strip, 27-year-old female music fan Millet Ben Haim and her friends were partying all night at a music festival. At this moment, she and her friends were looking forward to for several months. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, the young Israeli scholar Haim Ketzman stayed at his home in Holit, which is only 1.5 kilometers away from the Gaza Strip, as usual. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A sudden attack suddenly changed the course of their lives. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some of them witnessed the white tracks of rockets streaking across the sky, some heard gunshots from all directions in the wilderness, and some encountered Hamas armed forces head-on. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;Crisis, from South to North&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In the early morning of October 7, young music fans sang and danced at the &quot;Parallel Universe&quot; Music Festival In full swing. This music festival originated in Brazil and has a history of 23 years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporters saw from the timetable announced by the organizer that the music festival will start at 23:00 on October 6th and continue until the afternoon of the 7th. This means fans can head out for an &quot;all-night dance party.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Music fans are looking forward to this long-awaited music festival, and Milit is one of them. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The music festival is held near Rem Kibbutz, which is about 1.25 hours&#39; drive from Tel Aviv, Israel&#39;s largest city. Many music fans drive here. At the same time, it was only a few kilometers away from the Gaza Strip, which foreshadowed the subsequent tragedy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At dawn, danger begins to fall. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the early morning of October 7, Hamas fired thousands of rockets at Israel, and many armed personnel used homemade simple gliders to infiltrate into the disputed area from the Gaza Strip isolation area. Videos and pictures that appeared on social media showed that Hamas militants also entered Israeli-controlled areas in pickup trucks and motorcycles. Those along the Palestinian-Israeli separation zone bear the brunt. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Around 6:31 in the morning, the music stopped and the siren sounded.&quot; Millit recorded the moment with a video on social media. &quot;More and more rockets were flying into the sky and we realized we had to leave immediately,&quot; she wrote. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A video circulating on social media showed dozens of young people running in panic in an open field, surrounded by abandoned cars and followed by intensive gunfire. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Along the flight route of the rockets, air defense sirens continued to sound in many places in Israel. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the central city of Rehovot, Chinese chef Zhang Feng was also woken up by a &quot;sound&quot; at around 6 a.m. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is between the Gaza Strip and Tel Aviv. Zhang Feng saw &quot;wave after wave&quot; of rockets passing over the city and heading north, &quot;many of which were intercepted.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the attack began, Zhang Feng and his colleagues squeezed into the small bomb shelter again and again, listening to the sound of air defense sirens, flying artillery shells, and explosions after being intercepted. The first wave of attacks lasted for two or three hours. After more than two years in Israel, Zhang Feng felt that &quot;this was the most powerful one.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhang Feng works in a restaurant in Rehovot. On the morning of the 7th, he and his colleagues received a holiday notice, which surprised them. According to him, every Saturday, many Israelis take their families out to eat, which is often the busiest time for restaurant business. Although they have experienced air raid warnings many times before, they will still go to work normally after the danger is lifted. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“We rarely had holidays in the past. The fact that we can have a holiday this time shows that the situation is very serious.” Zhang Feng said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the northern city of Jerusalem, Liu Zihui and her companions set off from the hotel by car at around 9 o&#39;clock. Taking advantage of the National Day holiday, she embarked on an &quot;in-depth cultural tour&quot;. According to the original plan, they would arrive in Tel Aviv on the morning of the 7th, stay one night and then return home. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, not long after setting off from Jerusalem, Liu Zihui and his party heard an air raid siren. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;The driver stopped immediately and the tour guide took us to hide in the concert hall on the roadside.&quot; Liu Zihui heard from the staff of the concert hall that they also received a short notice to cancel the performance. After the alarm was lifted, the staff also made a special trip to apologize, saying &quot;I&#39;m sorry for causing you such a bad experience during your trip.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For safety reasons, the originally planned trip was canceled and the tour guide took everyone directly to the hotel. Because the reserved room was not ready yet, the group of people waited in the hotel lobby, and lunch was ordered and delivered from a nearby Chinese restaurant. Liu Zihui&#39;s room is on the 10th floor, and &quot;helicopters flying over&quot; can be seen directly outside the window. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From 7 p.m., air raid sirens sounded several more times in Tel Aviv. Liu Zihui said that everyone had to eat dinner in the hotel&#39;s safe room. It didn&#39;t become calm until after 9 p.m. &quot;My companions and I slept in the same clothes, and we didn&#39;t dare to take a shower or pack our things until three o&#39;clock in the morning.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Evacuation, crowds flocked to the airport&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;When the crisis occurred, Chinese tourist Amy was taking a bus to the center of the Israeli vortex. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Amy loves traveling and has always been curious about the religious Middle Eastern countries. In previous years, she has been to Egypt and Turkey, and the destinations of this trip are Jordan and Israel. Amy and her husband plan to enter Israel from Jordan so that the two countries can play together and &quot;it is also very convenient to apply for a visa on arrival.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to Amy and her husband, there was also a young Arab-American carpooling together. According to the plan, the group was going to take the border crossing in central Jordan, but after the raid, the crossing was temporarily closed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“When the driver said he couldn’t go, we couldn’t believe it and insisted on going over to find out, but there were also police stopping us on the road. When we saw the bloody scene displayed by the driver, the three of us were shocked. &quot;Amy said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Israeli-Palestinian conflict has been going on for a long time, and Amy and her group didn’t take it seriously at first. As more and more news of the conflict came in, they decided to abandon their original plan and proceed via the northern border crossing instead. &quot;Time was very tight, and we couldn&#39;t think too much. Coupled with the language barrier, the driver said no matter what, so we went along,&quot; Amy said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The northern Jordanian border crossing is relatively remote and sparsely populated. Amy and her husband wanted to find someone to carpool with and asked multiple transit passengers, but they were all rejected. When Amy was about to call the insurance company for help, they &quot;miraculously&quot; hailed a taxi on a street farther away. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;At that time, people at the border crossing were saying that it was impossible to fly today, and we were worried that the flight would be cancelled. In addition, it was the Sabbath and there were few people going to work, so we were also worried that we would not be able to get to the airport on time.&quot; Go to On the way to the airport, Amy and her husband repeatedly called the airline to confirm whether the plane was taking off normally. At the same time, they had to call the insurance company to inquire about the claim settlement. &quot;They were on tenterhooks all the way.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;They arrived at the airport at 3:30 pm and saw many passengers waiting in line. &quot;Thankfully, I checked in early. If I missed my flight, it would be more difficult to return home in the future,&quot; Amy said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Amy’s worries are not unfounded. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the raid, Delta Air Lines and American Airlines canceled flights from New York to Israel scheduled for the 7th and 8th. Lufthansa also announced on the 7th that it would significantly cancel flights to Tel Aviv. In addition, the Feichangzhun App shows that the recent round-trip flights from Shanghai and Shenzhen in China to Tel Aviv in Israel have also been cancelled. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Unlike Amy&#39;s &quot;multiple countries in one day&quot;, Liu Zihui took a flight home the day after the attack. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Early in the morning on the 8th, Liu Zihui packed her luggage. According to the plan, they will fly from Ben Gurion International Airport to the capital Beijing. After arriving at the airport, Liu Zihui found that although there were many people, they were in good order. During the exchange, Liu Zihui discovered that some people arrived on the first day because they were afraid that the airport would be closed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The big flight screen was all red, leaving only sporadic green. &quot;A large number of flights have been cancelled, and only a few are flying normally.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It wasn&#39;t until the plane took off that Liu Zihui&#39;s hanging heart fell to the ground, and she fell into a deep sleep for the rest of the journey. At 5:28 a.m. on October 9, the plane landed at Beijing Capital International Airport, and warm applause erupted in the cabin. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I saw the bright lights on the ground in Beijing through the porthole, and I felt a little excited. I have landed countless times, and I have never been as excited as today.&quot; Liu Zihui said. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Unfortunate news&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Not everyone can evacuate as smoothly as Amy and Liu Zihui. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the morning of October 9, staff of Jiangsu Zhonglan Overseas Employment Company, which engages in overseas labor dispatch business, told Southern Weekend reporters that as of 11 a.m. that day, the company knew that three people were missing in Israel, and the others were missing. The situation is still being updated. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 10, a spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and relevant embassies and consulates abroad have issued safety reminders in response to the current situation in Israel and Palestine, advising Chinese citizens not to travel to Israel and Palestine for the time being. Local Chinese citizens and institutions remain highly vigilant, strengthen safety precautions, prepare for emergencies and take shelter on site. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Millit experienced a &quot;near escape&quot; while attending the music festival. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to Milliet’s account on social platforms, she and her friends initially fled in a car. When they crossed a main road, they encountered a double attack from the attackers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Someone was screaming and attackers were shooting at people who were going there, so I turned around as fast as I could. Two minutes later, I saw there were more attackers going in the other direction,&quot; she said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Later, Millet and her friends escaped in the wilderness. After about three hours, weak and frightened, they hid in the bushes and covered themselves with leaves. During this period, they tried to call the police, but the police did not respond. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Millet&#39;s experience has attracted the attention of many media, and the &quot;Washington Post&quot; quoted her experience in a report on October 8. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the attack, the organizers of the &quot;Parallel Universe&quot; music festival issued a bilingual announcement in Hebrew and English to search for missing persons. Comment sections on social platforms are crowded with anxious people. They kept leaving messages asking about their missing relatives and friends. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;We are shocked and pained.&quot; The organizer &quot;New Star Tribe&quot; said in the announcement that it is making every effort to assist the security forces in searching for missing persons in the area. The organization also provides an online missing person statistics form, where family members can upload their details. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;We pray that good news will come to you and me soon,&quot; the announcement said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Also close to the border with the Gaza Strip, the young Israeli scholar Haim Ketzman died in his home in Holit. On October 8, Katzman’s mother announced the news on social platforms. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Kettsman is a young scholar engaged in Israel studies. His resume is still hanging on the official website of the University of Washington. It can be seen from this that he studied for bachelor&#39;s, master&#39;s and doctoral degrees at the Open University of Israel, Ben-Gurion University, and the University of Washington. His research interests include Israeli religion and politics. Katzman’s mother, Hannah, works for an Israeli NGO. After Katzman was killed, the organization also publicly mourned on social platforms. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From the information released by Ketzman’s mother, it can be seen that at first she mistakenly believed that Ketzman had been “kidnapped”. For this reason, she also posted missing person information on social platforms. When the bad news came, the missing person information was corrected, &quot;He died at home.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Avital Alajem, Katzman’s neighbor and friend, was interviewed by CNN on October 9. She said Ketzman hid in the closet with her when Hamas militants broke in and shot her. She herself was not injured in the attack and &quot;Katzman saved my life.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Kettsman received the 2019 &quot;Kimmerlin Best Graduate Thesis Award&quot; from the Israel Studies Association. The award honors the memory of Baruch Kimmerling, an Israeli public intellectual and sociologist. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the winning essay, Ketzman had this speech: Dedicated to all forms of life between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ketzmann’s friend Marwa Maziad wrote in her eulogy, “He truly believed that all life forms were equal and beautiful, including the plants in his care.

I don&#39;t know when. A saving trend is taking over social media. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;How hard can young people of this generation work to save money? It can be said that only you can’t think of it, but there is nothing young people can’t do. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&lt;span>;Contemporary people’s new hobby: don’t consume, save money like crazy&lt;/span>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;&lt;span>;In Between going to work and making progress, this generation of young people choose incense; between buying bags and getting drunk, they are more likely to choose to buy lottery tickets; between ideals and reasons, financial management is the favorite of young people - the main thing is One saves money and makes money! &lt;/span>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Douban&#39;s &quot;Living with Interest: Savings Group&quot; now has more than 100,000 members in the group, &quot;Living with Interest: Investment and Financial Management&quot; group , the number of team members exceeds 600,000. Not to mention the &quot;Stingy Women&#39;s Association&quot; and the &quot;Stingy Men&#39;s Association&quot;, with a total of millions of people joining the groups. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In order to save money, some people choose to keep accounts and plan carefully, some choose to live with interest, manage finances and buy funds, and some choose to do both their main business and side business, and become a slash youth. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;When using the accounting APP, sorting out personal bills regularly is just an entry-level step. Learn from the collective wisdom of various money-saving groups and discover various wool-gathering artifacts, shopping red envelopes, Membership discounts, point deductions, live group buying, multi-platform price comparisons, and resolutely not letting go of any hidden benefits are the new life wisdom that young people get. For example, there are young people who squat after midnight every day to grab expired food and leftovers. boxes to reduce the cost of food expenses. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;These can be regarded as an evolved version of actions for young people, and students at higher levels have already started playing special forces to save money. Compare banks across the country to see whose interest rate is better. Higher, choose to travel thousands of miles to go. Some media reported that after bank interest rates were lowered this year, some young people traveled 2,000 kilometers a day and spent 330 yuan on fares just to earn an extra 1,800 yuan in interest. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Some people feel that this is too unfair to themselves. The reason why young people are happy to live in peace with the &quot;hard life&quot; is that there is a high probability that saving money is like a snowball, and seeing themselves The small treasury is getting fuller day by day, and the sense of accomplishment can, to a certain extent, make people forget the hardships in the early days. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;As the Japanese writer Yataro Matsuura once wrote in &quot;Getting Rich Slowly: Money and Work Rules to Make Your Life Richer&quot;: &quot;It is easier to save money than to spend it. After all, there are many ways to spend money, but there is only one way to save money, and that is to &#39;spend less&#39;.&quot; Because the path is single and clear, as long as the goal is firm enough and you continue in the established direction, you will always succeed. Realization, and therefore, attracts more and more young people to join the game. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Rejecting the trap of consumerism, young people have truly become sober in the world. I am no longer obsessed with following trends and buying the latest electronic products; I no longer order takeout frequently, but choose to go to the market with the aunts to buy food and bring my own meals; I no longer have to take a taxi every time I walk, but can walk. Walk, take the subway and never take a taxi. The money saved at every step is like a trickle, which eventually converges into a stream or a river. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/10/db7bc1d8642781493c9860d7666c2e84.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;721&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/10/db7bc1d8642781493c9860d7666c2e84.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;253558 &quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span>;（IC photo&amp;nbsp;/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&lt; span>;Saving money, can you save money&lt;/span>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;So when it comes to saving money, to what extent do young people hope to save money? A report shows that more than 53.7% of 30-year-olds believe that saving 100,000 yuan can be regarded as having a certain basis for savings. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;However, the cold reality is that a survey by China Business News shows: with a deposit of more than 100,000 yuan, you have already surpassed 53.7% of your peers. More than half of young people have less than 100,000 in savings, and it is a reality that they are &quot;powerless&quot;. Young people who are trying their best to save money find that money is like fine sand. The tighter you hold it, the more it will be lost. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The road to financial freedom is full of thorns. However, the will of young people is gradually firming up, and they are no longer attracted by the lavish spending of consumerism. Instead, they do not want to buy and save everything, and everything is compromised for the enrichment of their small coffers. What social trends does it reflect that young people are working hard to save money? Some people&#39;s ambition to save money is to retire early and implement a FIRE plan (Financial Independence, Retire Early); others are saving money for more security and more confidence to cope with the future. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;After all, the greater the balance, the greater the sense of security. Money means having enough protection against unknown risks. It can help young people live without panic and ask for help less when encountering problems. In the final analysis, it is essentially due to the inherent risk aversion. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;As Ulrich Beck said in &quot;Risk Society&quot;, life risks are always present, and individuals are forced to face the individualization process, which is constructed in the early modernization stage. The security system can no longer provide protection for individuals, and individualization has therefore entered a new stage. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Increased social mobility, the increasingly blurred boundaries between unemployment and employment, the disintegration of clan-based family relationships, work and intimate relationships, all of which are unavoidable issues for this generation of young people. Making young people aware of risks also inspires their desire to cling to something stable when the wave of risks strikes, so as to seek peace and tranquility in their own years. But before the dawn of dawn, money becomes the coordinate axis of reality, and saving money is the magic weapon for young people to resist risks. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;If you think that young people save money without spending it, you are totally wrong. Different from the older generation who simply save money, young people focus on saving money and spending money when they should. In this Houlang’s value perception, saving money is to spend money better, to spend money wisely, and to pursue a higher sense of value and cost-effectiveness. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Bill Gates once said: &quot;It is as difficult to spend a sum of money wisely as to earn it.&quot; Therefore, if you feel it is worthwhile, travel to see the world and learn New skills and new experiences are worth saving money to achieve. However, if you feel that it is not worth it, such as a takeaway meal that has increased in price, or expensive ugly clothes in the mall, then you are not willing to pay extra for it. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Young people who often surf the Internet have given various &quot;painless money saving&quot; methods a new title, naming them &quot;Princess Money Saving Method&quot; &quot;365-day money saving method&quot; &quot;Muyu money saving method&quot;...&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Even in order to increase the sense of ritual of saving money, when achieving the goal, you will appropriately increase yourself Rewards, such as saving 50 yuan a day and saving up money for a concert ticket in three months, will not affect your normal living standards, but at the same time, you can satisfy your hobbies and interests, just like making a coin-operated wish, in the wilderness of life Here, brave people are at the forefront, enjoying the world first and creating their own unique style and lifestyle. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Bulk up your wallet and enrich your life. Are you in love with this young generation’s view on saving money? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 11 Oct 2023 11:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[主持人实名举报，法院12368热线能不能外包？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258377]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-11 11:13:55&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;Host Zhang Zequn.

According to a cursory search, dozens of courts at the provincial, municipal, and county levels across the country , there is a phenomenon of public bidding for hotline outsourcing services. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Some netizens raised questions about the functions, responsibilities and positioning of the 12368 hotline.

Judicial information public welfare service number common to the national court system. Beijing is the first pilot area for the &quot;12368&quot; judicial service hotline, which was officially opened on January 7, 2009. The &quot;Beijing Court 12368 Hotline&quot; has set up a main platform in the Beijing High Court, and has set up sub-platforms in all middle and grassroots courts. Six courts, namely Dongcheng, Xicheng, Chaoyang, Haidian, Fengtai and Daxing, have set up direct dial lines and do not need to be forwarded through the Municipal High Court&#39;s main platform; calls from other court sub-platforms will be uniformly answered and accepted by the Municipal High Court&#39;s main platform, and will be forwarded according to the situation of the call. The case shall be handled by the lower court on separate platforms. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;According to the &quot;Rule of Law Daily&quot; report in 2021, the 12368 direct sub-platform of Xicheng Court consists of 5 lines, and staff will receive more than 200 calls every day , looking for judges, investigating cases, answering questions, receiving opinions, making demands, etc. According to the relevant person in charge of the Beijing High Court, if parties call the 12368 hotline to ask for simple matters such as checking the progress of the case, submitting applications and materials, and procedural litigation consultation, the hotline will &quot;answer the lawsuit&quot; as soon as possible and give a direct reply; If the exercise of judicial power or matters closely related to the case require a response from the judge, the hotline will issue a work order to the judge, who will handle it in a timely manner within the specified time limit to ensure that the contact rate of the judge reaches 100%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Zhang Zequn reported to the Chaoyang Court 12368 hotline. On October 8 and 9, 2023, Southern Weekend reporters called the hotline several times to inquire about the &quot;collegial panel&quot; and hotline outsourcing. On one occasion, the operator responded that he could ask the judge about the legal terms and the circumstances in which they appeared, and he would give a reply within two days. Another time, the operator replied that 12368 is mainly responsible for registering complaint information and cannot directly handle complaints. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Another call occurred at around 8 pm. The artificial intelligence voice assistant provided a self-service intelligent voice query service. When the keyword &quot;Collegial Court&quot; was mentioned , gave a more detailed answer. However, artificial intelligence voice assistants may have unclear or inaccurate hearing from time to time, and if there is a semantic recognition error, they will continue to output large sections of legal or procedural regulations and cannot be interrupted manually. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;The role of 12368 focuses on information consultation.&quot; A lawyer surnamed Liu told a Southern Weekend reporter that the customer service line of the 12368 hotline mainly relies on the query system. No special professional answering ability is required; more professional questions related to court functions can mainly be completed by calling the legal aid hotline 12348 or going to the court case filing window. Lawyer Liu often interacts with courts and does legal knowledge popularization work on Internet platforms in his spare time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;He also introduced that many parties involved in the case have little contact with the court and do not understand the existence of 12368. In contrast, lawyers entrusted by parties are the group who have more contact with the 12368 hotline. For lawyers, 12368 is mainly used to understand the progress of the case and to inquire about other channels for detailed consultation. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Outsourcing is more common&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;April 2023, Beijing The &quot;Beijing Higher People&#39;s Court 12368 Hotline Litigation Platform Service Fee Project Winning Announcement&quot; published by the Municipal Government Procurement Network revealed that China Mobile Online Services Co., Ltd. won the bid for &quot;Beijing Higher People&#39;s Court 12368 Hotline Litigation Platform Service&quot; at a price of 7.74972 million yuan. &quot;Fees Project&quot;, the service period is 12 months. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Introducing the &quot;overall model&quot; in the announcement, the 12368 manual hotline service adopts the access model of the main platform of the High Court and the sub-platforms of the middle and grassroots courts to provide the society with 5× 8 hours service. The bidder provides workplace wiring services, as well as operation team recruitment, training, management, call quality inspection, callback, etc. The number of seats in the operation team shall not be less than 65, and there shall be no less than one full-time call quality inspector. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;According to media reports, in 2022, the number of manual calls to the Beijing Court’s 12368 hotline reached 1.4942 million, a year-on-year increase of 67.2%, ranking first in the country. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;You will know after going to the court a few times to do things. They really have a lot of things to do and are very busy.&quot; Wang Cailiang, director of Beijing Cailiang Law Firm, once organized lawyers to go to the court. The &quot;Legal Aid Hotline 12348&quot; of the judicial system provides free consultation. He explained to Southern Weekend reporters that it is very common not only in the court system, but also in some government agencies and institutions to outsource hotlines involving legal issues. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;He said that if normal bidding procedures are followed, this kind of outsourcing behavior is not a bad idea. The key is that the legal professionalism of the outsourcing unit must be excellent so that it will not be criticized by the outside world. &quot;If you are not professional, wrong and knowledgeable, you will not be able to satisfy the masses,&quot; he said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Many people are unwilling to do consultations and receive public consultations.&quot; Wang Cailiang explained that staff in some units regard receiving public consultations as a kind of burden and therefore tend to outsource this work. He believes that communication and consultation are originally good opportunities to resolve conflicts. If used as a burden, conflicts will accumulate and expand, thus consuming more judicial resources. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Southern Weekend reporter&#39;s search found that the outsourcing of &quot;12368&quot; is common in courts at all levels across the country, but the specific bidding details vary greatly. Due to different levels of economic development, the business volume of courts in various regions varies greatly, and the contract amounts therefore vary significantly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;For example, a provincial high court in an economically underdeveloped southern province issued a bidding announcement in July 2023, which showed that its “12368 litigation service hotline outsourcing The project&#39;s budget is only 600,000 yuan; while the contracting budget of another large city district court in March 2023 reached 1.5 million yuan. In addition to the separate bidding model for each court, a province in East China has adopted a model of &quot;provincial centralized deployment and social outsourcing of the 12368 litigation service hotline of the province&#39;s courts&quot;, with an overall budget of more than 24 million yuan, requiring intelligent voice, intelligent work orders, Intelligent agent assistance and a unified litigation service knowledge base empower the core engine, open up the litigation service system, and realize the entire process of consultation, inquiry, appointment, and processing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The contract period of these outsourcing services usually ranges from 1 to 3 years, and subcontracting and subcontracting are expressly prohibited. Among the winning bidders, state-owned enterprises and private enterprises It’s both. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Currently, there are no regulations that clearly allow or prohibit outsourcing.&quot; Wu Liwei, a lawyer at Beijing Beidou Dingming Law Firm, often calls the court hotline because he needs to check the progress of the case. Consultation was conducted, but I felt that many outsourcers did not understand legal issues. &quot;Since it is a litigation service hotline, it is to facilitate parties, lawyers and other people who may be involved in the lawsuit to understand relevant legal issues and litigation processes. From this function, internal court personnel should be responsible for answering calls and answering questions.&quot;&lt;/p >; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In addition, Wu Liwei also believes that outsourcing the court hotline may involve leaking privacy. He explained that lawyers and clients often need to call the hotline to inquire about the progress of the case. Although the specific details of the case will not be involved, the &quot;cause of the case&quot; itself contains a lot of private information. &quot;For example, who files a divorce lawsuit against whom, and who sues whom for defamation, insult, or damage to reputation, all involve the privacy of the parties involved.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS ：&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https ://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 11 Oct 2023 11:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[误认家长为人贩子被打：一场基于双向误解的冲突]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258369]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-11 10:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;A few days ago, a netizen told an experience of his on social media, which caused widespread attention and controversy. The blogger herself described the version as follows: She said she had a &quot;fracture on her face&quot; and was beaten by her parents because she felt her parents looked like human traffickers. She then had a sense of justice and finally the two parties went to the police station. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She wrote: At the police station...it was said that I hit him with a pole first, and then he hit me. In fact, I just followed them from beginning to end, constantly asking the little girl: &quot;Kid, is he a member of your family?&quot; Once or twice I tried to gently hold her hand to confirm with her what the relationship between this man and her was. The little girl didn&#39;t say anything, and I didn&#39;t dare to confirm whether he was a trafficker, so I kept delaying time and told him to stop and not leave. My purpose was to wait until the police came to investigate clearly. He was too fierce, and I was afraid that he would beat him. I. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Then he was really beaten: Later, when he walked near his car, he suddenly put down the child, turned around and punched me on the head several times... and broke the handle (of the camper) with all his strength. He hit me on the head with the broken end of the metal handle...&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On this Weibo, there are those who sympathize and support, but also those who ridicule and ridicule. Of course, what we can see so far is the blogger’s unilateral perspective and description, which may not be accurate or complete. To understand the full truth, the media should interview the other party or ask the local police for information. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If the subject of the facts described by the blogger is true, that is, he is well-intentioned, suspects that the parents are human traffickers, and then follows them, talks to the child, and &quot;once or twice tried to gently hold her hand.&quot; &quot;Hand&quot;, because the child kept silent, &quot;I had to keep stalling for time to tell him to stop and not leave.&quot; This is one party’s perspective. What if we look at it from the perspective of the child’s father? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As a father, he carried his child to a private car. Suddenly a stranger appeared and was following me. He also approached the child and kept saying incomprehensible words. He also tried to touch his child and questioned whether he was the child&#39;s biological father. A normal reaction would be to get angry. When he got near his car, he felt that the child was safe, so he decided to teach the other party a lesson, letting the child know that his father would protect him, and venting his anger. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It should be said that protecting one&#39;s children is a normal reaction of any parent. If strangers continue to behave in this way, parents with children will see it as provocation or bad intentions. As for children not answering strangers&#39; questions, it is normal. They may be introverted, or they may not want to talk to strangers of unknown origin due to safety education at school or at home. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is rumored that in order to snatch children from their parents, one of the tricks used by traffickers is to snatch the children from their parents when the parents are not paying attention, and then lie to passers-by that they are the parents of the children, or Lie that it is a dispute between husband and wife and snatch the child, in order to dissuade passers-by from intervening, so that passers-by will be less willing to intervene. And these urban legends (Urban Legends) actually have their roots. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A father posted a video introduction. On the evening of July 13, 2023, his wife took her child out to play. A woman directly tried to snatch the child. Fortunately, she was not far from the child and stopped her in time. &quot;The woman She kept telling others that she was her child, but the people around her didn’t dare to interfere. Later she tried to run away, but I restrained her.” According to a local police report: The woman involved had a history of multiple medical treatments for mental illness. Although the woman was proven to be mentally ill and not a trafficker, she used the phrase &quot;it&#39;s her child&quot; when she robbed the child. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are also sane people who snatch children from others in public. On December 17, 2019, Ms. Wang and her mother came to Shanghai Station with their 2-year-old twins, preparing to take the bus back to their hometown in Zhengzhou. When they were resting at the southeast exit of the station, a middle-aged woman pushing a stroller and wearing a black coat picked up her little daughter and prepared to leave in public. Ms. Wang and the surrounding passengers hurriedly stopped the woman and immediately called the police. The woman lied that she &quot;had the wrong hug.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Going back to the case at the beginning of the article, the logical chain may be that the woman believed that the child’s father was a suspected human trafficker; conversely, the child’s father probably also regarded her as a suspected human trafficker or mentally ill, which led to A conflict based on misunderstandings on both sides. The starting point of the blogger involved is worthy of recognition, but in fact, when an adult walks on the street holding a child, from the &quot;prior probability&quot; (prior probability), the probability that it is a parent holding their own child is still extremely high. At the same time, there is no reason why it is normal for parents to have close interactions with their children anytime and anywhere. If the child who is being held cries and screams and says he wants his mother, he clearly says &quot;Who are you? I don&#39;t know you, I want my mother.&quot; That&#39;s indeed a bit suspicious. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This incident also reminds us that it is a good thing to have love and a sense of justice, but we should proceed from common sense and rationality, based on reliable judgment, and on the premise of safeguarding our own safety; when we meet the real In suspicious situations, do not directly conflict with the other party. It is best to use legal means to solve the problem. Of course, acting bravely should be encouraged, but it must be objectively true, such as stopping an ongoing crime. If you misjudge the nature of the matter, you are actually infringing on other people&#39;s personal freedom and reputation rights, which will inevitably lead to the consequences of misjudgment and wrong actions. This is the revelation beyond what is right and what is wrong. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 11 Oct 2023 10:25:03 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
