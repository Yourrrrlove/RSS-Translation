This debut has been for more than 10 years The band has become a very popular new face this summer. The lives of the three members are filled with various schedules, which are far more intense than the busy schedule of farming. Before they stand on the stage, they live in the ground. Ban farmers are busy planting in spring. Passers-by work as bricklayers on construction sites all year round, and occasionally go to the streets to sing and sing. Shiba was farming in his hometown and working as a street singer in Guilin. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to maintain the order of life as much as possible in Vaina&#39;s busy life, the three members have agreed to spend half the month wandering outside and the other half living at home. For now, they are still looking for a new rhythm. Lu Min and Shiba have not yet adapted to the sudden increase in cameras and flashlights. They feel uncomfortable facing the camera, their eyes flicker, and they don&#39;t speak much. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Not long ago, Shiba went to the streets to sing, spending half the time singing and the other half taking photos with the audience. He made a promise to himself: go there at least once a month. &quot;After all, it&#39;s been 18 years since I first started singing.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In September 2023, &quot;Big Dream&quot; - using age as a node, written from birth to death, has every age Duan&#39;s Dilemma - Before the stage broadcast, we conducted an exclusive interview with the Waina band. They detailed the beginning and end of the establishment of the Waina band and the lives of the three individuals. But at that time, there was still a short period of time before they really became popular, and they belonged to the &quot;former Waina&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Will they change? &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Real creation is a portrayal of people’s sense of distance on the land of this era&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: italics , italics_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You performed outstandingly in &quot;Summer of the Band&quot;. Although it has been 10 years since your debut, you are a new face to the public. What do you think of this “newness”? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Vayna: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;The reason why we went to participate was just for a stage. I have loved writing songs for a long time, but I haven’t had the opportunity to communicate with everyone. This stage allows us to freely express our original attitudes. Sing the songs we want to sing authentically. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From the perspective of Lumin and Shiba, they are indeed young and new. And I (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Editor&#39;s note: Banong&lt;/span>;) have been singing for many years, and I just want to say that this is the first time everyone has heard it. Some of our songs have a different angle from the songs that everyone often hears, and (the audience) has a new feeling. But it is not new to us. We have always been ourselves. What is new (in the eyes of the audience) is something very old about us. It has always been some of our emotions and states of life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/22/wrdjPeNhz0AExO9YK8KzSq2BkFbY9EhfybgPc3kk.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/22/wrdjPeNhz0AExO9YK8KzSq2BkFbY9EhfybgPc3kk.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;259205&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Ban farmers inspect old rice varieties in their fields&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo provided by interviewee)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p >; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;After getting on this stage, will the invitations and performances that are pouring in come to me? Destroy your rhythm of life and affect your original attitude? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Waina:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;If we don’t have a clear direction, we will be destroyed, but if we have a good direction, it is not destruction; To help us build the state we want, it mainly depends on how we grasp it. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We still pay more attention to our own lives, and now we have agreed to spend half a month living at home and half a month doing more communication outside. Of course, this half-month plan is a regular plan. If you are busy with farming or have something to do at home, you can adjust it slightly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Will your creations be affected? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Vayna: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;It’s still land, it’s the relationship between land and people, it’s something real (things) related to life, coming from experience A little more stuff. We prefer to express some emotions from contemporary real life, rather than purely creating or imagining something. This kind of thing derived from reality also has artistic modification techniques. But man is a thing on the land and has a close relationship with the land. Many of people&#39;s sorrows today may be a sequelae of a certain separation between people and the land. People must be inseparable from a relationship with the land and life as a whole, including the countryside and the city. If your creation is real, it must be a portrayal of a person&#39;s sense of distance on the land in this era. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We have no limits on what we want to create, but there may be a starting point. The Wayna band wants to retain the style of Wayna, but we all have other creations privately, some very different creations based on personal hobbies. But in Waina, it is better not to go off topic. Like when we sing now, we have a little interaction, but in fact I (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Editor&#39;s note: Banong &lt;/span>;) Make some pure music, which is not very similar to Waina’s songs. I have also tried a lot of electronic music. Therefore, we limit our vision to the countryside and describe some changes in people and nature, people and society in contemporary rural areas. This is the main style. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;A song like &quot;Big Dream&quot; is not considered traditional Waina style, but it has attracted many people now. Will your future creations be biased? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Waina: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;It is still close to a portrayal of real life, like &quot;Grandma Returns&quot; written by Lu Min. That song is Hakka. But Waina is from the Zhuang ethnic group, so that’s fine. It’s still a very rural and authentic creation. The so-called reality means that it is like something growing out of the ground. It does not mean that we just make a flower. Of course, that is also a kind of beauty and a kind of consciousness, but Wayna prefers this aspect (reality). &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;(Everyone likes &quot;Big Dream&quot;) It&#39;s okay, everyone likes it. Let&#39;s just sing &quot;Big Dream&quot; three times first and then sing country. Good. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Are you satisfied with your current life? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Vayna: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;It mainly depends on how to design. Everything has to be redesigned. There is no fixed life or a satisfactory life for you. , you should (adjust) it based on comfort and realism at any time, and don’t drift. We are quite free and can allocate our time as much as possible. If you want to go out and sing tonight, you can go out. If you don&#39;t want to go out, you can&#39;t go out. Take the initiative to do things without getting tired. It’s a bit hard to be regulated and do it. It was difficult for me to eat because I was probably trying to sleep at the time. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Waina Band was not a banker at the beginning , Lu Min and Shiba 3 members, will you stick to the current lineup in the future? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Vayna: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;This is sometimes like asking whether you will get divorced after getting married? I feel like it&#39;s flowing, don&#39;t try to kidnap a band. I hope that everyone will do something with their heart wherever they go, instead of just doing it for the sake of making money. Regardless of whether we stay together or not, everyone can continue to sing and live life truthfully. This is the most important thing. If the three of us get tired of our relationship and want to break up, then we will break up. But it doesn’t matter. From now on Shiba can continue to write good songs, I can continue to make music, and Lu Min can continue to sing the songs he wants to sing. This has nothing to do with whether we break up or not. The important thing is to always maintain the expression and experience of life. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You enjoy the feeling of being photographed in front of the camera ? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Vayna:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;（&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Shakes his head&lt;/span>; )&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Do you usually like to take pictures? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Wayna:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;（&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;岜农&lt;/span >;) Usually I can take pictures if I want to. I still like to take pictures of picking wild fruits and pricking them. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;What do you think is the standard for a good photo? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Waina:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Sometimes I look through my hard drive and find some photos that I thought were interesting at the time and beautifully posed, but in fact they are not. use. What&#39;s really useful? I did it, I filmed it. It reminded me of the actual experience and feelings of doing that thing. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;How do you define a perfect life? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Vayna: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Everyone should be different. He should find his most comfortable state, live freely, and be able to realize the meaning of life. Everyone is looking for that spot in him, and I found it early on. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The word &quot;full marks&quot; divides life. From the perspective of the whole life, every stage is a part of your life, just like a river. Which section do you like best? Waters? In fact, no stretch of water represents the river. I think every individual is a perfect score. If you can love yourself and let go like this, you will be a perfect score. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 23 Nov 2023 21:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[首位博士说丨曾志平：坚守正确就是意义所在]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261152]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-23 20:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Doctoral profile:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p >; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>;Zeng Zhiping, the first doctor of military law in New China. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>;Born in 1966 in Yudu County, Ganzhou, Jiangxi. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>;September 1984-July 1988, studied at the Nanchang Army Academy of the Chinese People&#39;s Liberation Army , received a bachelor&#39;s degree in military science. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>;1988-1995, successively&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font- family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>;Served as an officer of the People&#39;s Liberation Army stationed in Zhangzhou, Fujian and an instructor at Nanchang Army Academy. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>;September 1995-July 1998, studied at Xi&#39;an Political College and received a bachelor&#39;s degree in law Master&#39;s degree. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>;From 1998 to 2004, he served as an instructor at Nanchang Army Academy and a military lawyer. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>;September 2004-January 2007, studied at China University of Political Science and Law, receiving a bachelor&#39;s degree in law Ph.D. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>;From January 2007 to August 2018, he served as professor and senior professor of Nanchang Institute of Technology Professor, Dean and Vice President of the School of Political Science and Law.

(Photo courtesy of interviewee)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among the PhDs interviewed, Zeng Zhiping may be the last to obtain a PhD. In January 2007, he graduated early from China University of Political Science and Law and became China&#39;s first doctor of military law - 24 years had passed since the first batch of doctors trained after the reform and opening up were awarded degrees. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, as a secondary discipline under the category of law, the process of military law becoming a discipline is relatively late. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1984, legal scholars Zhang Youyu and Pan Nianzhi first proposed that military law is a branch of the legal system in the &quot;Encyclopedia of China·Law Volume&quot;; three years later, in May 1987, the former State Education Commission Military law was officially listed as a branch discipline of law; in 1993, the Military Law Department of Xi&#39;an Political College (now the Xi&#39;an Campus of the Political College of the National Defense University of the Chinese People&#39;s Liberation Army), the country&#39;s first teaching institution specializing in military legal education, was established, marking the establishment of the Department of Military Law. Military law professional education is officially on the right track. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2003, Xi&#39;an Political College became the first school with the right to award a doctorate in military law; in the same year, China University of Political Science and Law opened a military law research center. In 2004, China University of Political Science and Law began to recruit doctoral students in military law. Also in this year, Zeng Zhiping, who had the rank of lieutenant colonel, transferred from Nanchang Army College and was admitted to China University of Political Science and Law in September of the same year, becoming the only doctoral student in military law enrolled that year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zeng Zhiping studied under Professor Zhou Jian, a well-known expert in the field of military law and the first director of the Military Law Teaching and Research Office in China. Zhou Jian once pointed out in an article: &quot;Among the top ten legal disciplines identified by the Ministry of Education, military law (030110) can be said to be the one with the least talents and the most difficult to research.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Compared with law Among other majors, military law is a relatively mysterious and niche subject. Before changing careers, Zeng Zhiping worked in the army for 21 years. In a sense, it was his status as a soldier that gave him the opportunity to specialize in military law. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Zeng Zhiping’s view, today’s “openness” of military law is related to the atmosphere of the rule of law and the society’s demand for military legal talents. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Military academy, army, and then to military academy&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 凯体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>; In 1984, you were admitted to Nanchang Army College (now the Army Infantry College of the Chinese People&#39;s Liberation Army) as an undergraduate student. Why did you choose a military school at that time? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Zeng Zhiping: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;In our time, especially in rural areas, everyone’s life was not guaranteed. The ones with relatively better treatment were the military. . When I graduated from high school, I participated in the military draft. At that time, I was recruited to be a pilot, and the requirements were relatively high. I was rejected during the physical examination. When Nanchang Army Academy came to recruit students, the head teacher recommended me. I didn’t have any particularly strong ideas at the time, but my father thought it would be good to be an officer, so he went for it. If you want to say that I have any strong (ideas) towards the military or officers, I don’t think I have any. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;What is special about undergraduate education in military academies? ? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Zeng Zhiping:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Before I went to the military academy, I didn’t know much about the military or the military academy, but physical training was the most beneficial thing for me in the military academy. When I first went to school, I couldn&#39;t do any pull-ups. The school organized physical training, and during the training process, I made the fastest progress. Later, I became an all-around athlete in school and also participated in military sports competitions. Some of the teachers are from the army and will teach tactics, shooting, military fitness, formation and the like. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 凯体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;After graduating from Nanchang Army Academy, what did you do Which jobs? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Zeng Zhiping: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;After graduation, I was sent to the front-line army in Zhangzhou, Fujian. At that time, I was a platoon leader in a regiment. After a few months, I was transferred to the agency. During the training of all division cadres, the instructor of one training subject did not demonstrate accurately, so the regiment leader &quot;picked&quot; me out. Later, I became an instructor for many projects. This (experience) made me stand out. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I have been in the front-line army for four and a half years. I have served as an officer in the Organizational Section of the Political Department and as an instructor. After the Lantern Festival in 1993, I was transferred to Nanchang Army Academy to teach, which I applied for on my own initiative. At that time, I went to the Marxist-Leninist Teaching and Research Office, and the director of the Military Teaching and Research Office asked me: &quot;Why don&#39;t you come to me?&quot; He was my instructor when I was a student. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In school, I taught Introduction to International Politics when I first arrived because there were relatively few teachers taking this course at that time. I was also interested in the introduction to law class, and after one semester, I was teaching introduction to law. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Discipline Positioning&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Why will you continue? Study law on your own? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Zeng Zhiping: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;It’s a bit of a coincidence that something happened in the spring of 1993 that had a great impact on college students across the country: the International College Debate Competition , the one Jiang Changjian and the others participated in. It was really interesting for us to watch this competition at that time. Jiang Changjian majored in National Politics, so I wanted to go to Fudan to study for a graduate degree in International Politics. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But later at school, I learned that several young men we hung out with were preparing to take the bar exam. I felt that this matter was definitely the right thing to do. After weighing it, I said that I would study law instead of international politics. International politics is a &quot;dragon-slaying art&quot; and law is more practical. In 1994, I began to study law on my own in accordance with the requirements of the bar qualification examination syllabus. In October of that year, I ranked first in the military and qualified as a lawyer. &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(Southern Weekend Note: The national judicial examination system had not yet been established at that time, and you could obtain lawyer qualifications by passing the bar qualification examination.)&lt;/span>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;When I took the postgraduate entrance examination, I was not afraid of majors related to law. Because I had already passed the bar exam and my brain was good at that time, I thought I could pass the exam for any major. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You already teach in a military academy, why do you want to study for a master&#39;s degree? ? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Zeng Zhiping:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I had not thought about leaving the army at that time, but I did want to leave Nanchang Army Academy. Many professors in the school are older. I feel that if I don’t leave the school, I may not be as good as them when I get older. However, it is still relatively difficult to transfer to the army. The postgraduate entrance examination is a means of leaving school. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I wanted to take the international law major at Wuhan University, but someone told me that if you study as a graduate student at a local university, you have to go back to your original school after graduation, because it is impossible for local universities to You stay. So I chose Xi&#39;an Political College, which is also a military school. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Now that I think about it, if I had gone to Wuhan University from the beginning, my academic foundation might have been more reliable. If I received systematic academic training when I was young and read a lot of books, then my most source knowledge would be complete and my academic research would have a beginning and an end. My current knowledge cannot reach this level, which is a lifelong regret of mine. Now I mainly feel that my years have been wasted. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;When you were studying for a master&#39;s degree, what did you know about military law? Do you have any idea about what kind of disciplines and what kind of problems are to be solved? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Zeng Zhiping: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;This is true because I have a background in law. I have read a lot of materials before and also studied military law. In my master&#39;s degree, my direction is military justice, mainly studying the military prosecutorial system. What impressed me most was that I read a lot of English materials at that time and discussed with some famous professors the structure of criminal theory of the three levels of German and Japanese criminal law. This also had a great influence on me. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You developed a love for military law during your Ph.D. ? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Zeng Zhiping: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I can’t say it’s love. I just accumulated knowledge to a certain extent and have an understanding of this subject. On the other hand, I see a lot of work that is poorly written. I feel that my participation in this subject may make it better. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Let’s go back to discuss the positioning of the discipline of military law Question, do you think it belongs to the branch of military science or the branch of law? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Zeng Zhiping: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;It depends on how you treat belonging. This issue can be discussed from the subject management of the Ministry of Education, from the professional fields involved in the subject, and from the classification of knowledge. I only recognize the classification of knowledge. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;In June 2022, Wenzheng College of Suzhou University, Zeng Zhiping (fifth from left) is with students.

At that time, I returned to Nanchang and took an introduction to law class at school. Because there were several teachers taking the same course, I could only attend a few classes in one semester. In addition to taking classes at the military academy, I was also teaching part-time at several private universities. It can be said that teaching has nourished my psychology. In private universities, many students look at you with hungry and passionate eyes, which is different from what I encountered at my original school. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Then why did you go to China University of Political Science and Law? Where&#39;s Beau? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Zeng Zhiping: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;This is a bit of a coincidence. I had always wanted to change my job before the Spring Festival in 2004, but at that time the unit leader had not announced our job. There is news that I can change my job, I am just applying. At that time, I saw the information about various schools recruiting Ph.D.s, and I was thinking, &quot;Will it be approved (for career change) this year?&quot; Around January 10, 2004, after my application for job change was approved, I quickly checked the admissions information of various schools. I had always wanted to go to Wuhan University, but the registration had closed at that time. However, that year, because the Chinese Political Science and Law added a new doctoral program in military law, its registration period was extended, so I signed up. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When looking at school admissions information, I will also consult some teachers. I met Teacher Zhou Jian when I was studying at Xi&#39;an Political College, and I called him. I originally wanted to major in criminal law, and I have been teaching criminal law. Then teacher Zhou Jian said, you don’t want to major in criminal law. I teach military law in China’s political and legal field, so you can study military law with me. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I also told Teacher Zhou, &quot;I have changed careers, why should I study military law? I am still more interested in criminal law.&quot; Therefore, military law is really a product of the times, and I am also a product of the times. It is a coincidence. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Was the competition fierce to apply for a doctorate in military law at China University of Political Science and Law? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Zeng Zhiping:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;At that time, China University of Political Science and Law had three professors who could teach PhD students in military law, but that year only Professor Zhou Jian enrolled students, and the quota only one person. I was particularly impressed. There were 10 people who signed up at that time. I also checked the scores of other candidates using the score checking rules. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The rule for checking scores at that time was to just enter your admission ticket number. According to the numbering method of the admission ticket number, the first digits are the same, and the difference is in the last single digits and tens digits. Based on where we were in the exam room at that time, I could probably guess how many people were in front of me and behind me. After I checked my scores, I guessed their numbers, and I actually found out my scores. Seeing that the second place was 20 points lower than me, I felt more relaxed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;How will it be for you to get a doctorate from China University of Political Science and Law? Something more important? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Zeng Zhiping: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Yes, this is a very important turning point in life. At that time, I changed my career and had a doctorate in military law. Teacher Zhou said, China’s political and legal affairs will definitely keep you, so my life plan at that time had a general direction. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When I was studying for my master&#39;s degree, I once went to Beijing. While reading in the Beijing Library, I met an old gentleman. He went to an event at Peking University and we had a brief chat. He said something to the effect of &quot;If I can go to Peking University to be a professor in this life, I can do whatever I want.&quot; I had a very imaginary idea at that time: It would be great if I could become a professor of political science and law in China, so sometimes life is very strange. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, there were some changes later, and I did not stay at China University of Political Science and Law after graduation. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Cognition is the core of personality&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You Studying for a master&#39;s degree is to leave the original school; studying for a doctorate is to stay in a new school.

My current thoughts may be more mature thoughts, because my career is nearing the &quot;end&quot;. I think it is like this: you need to go to school, your school, the teachers and classmates you meet should work together to help you find your interests in life. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So I think an ideal society should be one where everyone is encouraged to do what you want to do and find your interests and passions.

In 2007, my son was going to take the college entrance examination. My simple thought was, can I graduate early? If I stay in China Political Science and Law, it will be very convenient for my son to go to school in Beijing. But my son didn&#39;t think it was necessary. He got good grades and was admitted to Wuhan University. But I finished my thesis and graduated half a year ahead of schedule. I didn’t mean to be the first. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I passed the graduation thesis defense in the morning, and the &quot;Legal Daily&quot; reported it in the afternoon. Later, some foreign media also followed up and reported the matter. It still seems very interesting now. I don&#39;t know if foreign media have paid attention to the first doctoral doctors of other disciplines, but at that time, many foreign media reported my report on my paper title &quot;On Military Organization&quot;, saying that I am right to be right. Such a major theoretical problem made a good study. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; I haven&#39;t told this tag to others myself. Or do some publicity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; Southern Weekend: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_gb2312, stkaiti;&quot;>; After graduating from Dr. you, he applied for Nanchang Institute of Technology and was ordered to form Nanchang Institute of Technology The Department of Political and Law of the College.

At that time, there were only a dozen universities with legal departments and laws in Jiangxi, so it had a great impact. For a long time, the school regarded me as a signboard. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In undergraduate education, I am very conscious. I did not take military law in the professional courses of law undergraduate. If you are the director yourself, the dean of the law school, and then start your class into a professional course, compile the textbook, and let everyone buy your book. This is very face -to -face. Until now, I have not compiled a textbook for military law. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; I started courses according to the most basic undergraduate majors. If you want to say something special, you can say that I have a very critical lesson in a few generals: ordinary logic, grammatical rhetoric, political introduction, and sociology. universal. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In 2016, we became a master&#39;s degree awarding construction unit in Jiangxi Province, which was issued by the relevant unit. I want students to receive good education, which is also a relatively direct work. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In fact, the sense of accomplishment in teaching also gives me the motivation to continue. Why do I insist on teaching? It is because I think there are many mistakes now, and teaching is also a wrong teaching. Sometimes I say it negatively. Although I am definitely not Popular (popular), I can make those virtual Popular be eliminated because I squeeze a position and make his virtual popular less one less one less.

The star recording a video for it is a satisfaction and public presentation of its mimic intimacy, but there is also another situation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;Individuals have beneficial demands for the appeal of the stars, &lt;span>; in popular terms, it can be understood as &#39;蹭 traffic&#39;, that is, the visibility and discussion of their visibility and discussion with the help of the celebrity, some even even Can be transformed directly on social media platforms into fans and platform returns, &quot;she said. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;span>; Nandu reporters saw from Zhang Yong&#39;s &quot;Buyer Show&quot; that there are many enthusiastic placing orders from various enterprises. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;span>; &quot;The company&#39;s demand for star recording videos is more pure, there is no need for relationships, but mainly the demands of interests.&quot; Huang Guiping explained that it is actually the popularity and popularity of the celebrity and The public trust endorses its own production &lt;/span>; product or brand and company image, reducing the skepticism and uncertainty of the public when purchasing its products. &quot;This &#39;with goods&#39; is relatively greater for celebrities.&quot; &lt;/P>; &lt;p>; Sun Peng (pseudonym) is the agent of well -known domestic draft women&#39;s groups. He told Nandu reporters that he generally told the artist that the company had clearly stipulated that these blessings videos were not allowed to be recorded. &quot;In my opinion, these income is not scientific.&quot; &amp; nbsp; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; At work, he will strictly distinguish the nature of video recording. &quot;For example, festive blessings or cultural promotion, you will collect the &#39;car and horse fee&#39; recording as appropriate. /span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;Span>; Nandu reporters found that sellers selling star blessings videos often do not only conduct this business.

Or return. But everyone has their own life, it is not easy to evaluate the quality of this phenomenon. &quot;&lt;/Span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>; &lt;strong>; &lt;span>; Risk: Stars may need to bear legal responsibility &lt;/&lt;/ Span>; &lt;/strong>; &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; &lt;span>; Star recording blessing video, seemingly commercial transactions that can be achieved by moving the mouth, in fact, there is a hidden risk that cannot be ignored. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;span>; If the birthday occasion, the star hinders the videos of blessings or charges, generally does not violate public order and customs, but if it involves the nature of the platform, &quot;endorsement&quot;, it cannot be understood simply For &quot;one party is willing to give money, one party can shoot &lt;/span>;&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The lawyer Wang Jiaxin, a lawyer of Guangdong Guangxin Junda Law Firm, analyzed to Nandu reporters that providing blessings for individuals can be regarded as a fan economic behavior. This form is not a civil legal act, and it does not actually cause legal interests. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; But if the stars shoot blessings for enterprises or products, because the star has celebrity effects, such videos are actually implying or explicitly showing the behavior of the advertising language &lt;span>; Enterprises and products should be widely promoted. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;span>; &quot;Therefore, such videos are advertising endorsement behaviors. If the company involved in the videos is suspected of illegal business and the star knows the business Responsibility. Wang Jiaxin said. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;span>; When a number of stars were exposed to recording a life video for the northern Burma electrical scammer, many netizens questioned, &quot;How many innocent people have the electronic scam head, why do you want to be for the people? He celebrates his birthday? &quot;&lt;/SPAN>; &lt;/P>; &lt;p>; &lt;span>;&quot; But if these blessings were exposed to the leader of electrical fraud, netizens&#39; reports were not established because it was a personal blessing video, and Do not target the company. &quot;Wang Jiaxin further explained that if the star wishes the video emphasizes the electrical fraud company, it is necessary to prove that the star knows the company&#39;s suspected electrical fraud, such as whether the star participates in the company&#39;s operation or holds the company&#39;s shares, but It is generally more difficult to proof. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Sun Peng, the agent of a well -known domestic draft female group agent, also felt that recording blessing videos such as &quot;irregular cooperation forms&quot; will increase the hidden dangers of the artist&#39;s own risk. . At the same time, he also admits that sometimes companies spend millions of yuan to invite artists to participate in the promotion and endorsement of the brand. During the promotion, it is actually difficult for artists to refuse the company&#39;s request for taking photos and recording videos. Once agreed, follow -up photos and videos will be used by the other party, and the results are uncontrollable. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;&quot; Before the relevant laws and regulations and policy provisions are issued, the star shooting congratulations video will indeed be in a gray area, so it will bring what we say &#39;&#39; &#39;&#39; Conflying money or not. &quot;The communication expert Huang Guiping told Nantu reporter that when lacking norms and regulation, celebrities, enterprises, and consumers are in a state of lack of guarantee, which may cause a lot of losses. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;span>; &quot;Therefore, when the relevant departments are rectified, the star is aware of the consumption of its own image, or the company realizes that Any kind of situation may make the &quot;star blessing video chaos&quot; relieved. &quot;Huang Guiping said. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 23 Nov 2023 19:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[俄乌电子战，矛与盾的游戏丨军事]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261148]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-23 18:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 11/22/zqImXE6gdbuSrUQOzIL5LmQgEpT8WQnfaDCzBvY9.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1795&quot; height=&quot;1200&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/22/zqImXE6gdbuSrUQOzIL5LmQg EpT8WQnfaDCzBvY9. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;259199&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On November 16, 2023, in the Donetsk region, unmanned troops of the Ukrainian army Aircraft operators are training not far from the front line &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Recently, the Ukrainian military claimed that it had Soldiers drove out their positions on the east bank of the Dnieper River in the occupied Kherson area and established multiple bridgeheads. Russia also admitted for the first time that the Kiev army had crossed the Dnieper River. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is of course a result worthy of attention, because the establishment of a bridgehead on the east bank of the Dnieper River poses a great threat to Crimea. If Ukraine can deploy long-range weapons on the east bank, Crimea may It’s hard to stick with it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;General Zaluzhny, Commander-in-Chief of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, emphasized in an interview with The Economist that Ukraine needs to develop and deploy its own advanced technology to regain the upper hand in the war. Behind the establishment of the bridgehead It is the tactical advantages brought about by a series of technological updates, especially in electronic countermeasures. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the outbreak of the Russo-Ukrainian War, Ukraine has been engaged in invisible electronic countermeasures with Russia. The battle in the Kherson area is the forefront of this confrontation, because the two sides can often only use it across the river. Long-range firepower exchanges, so drones become the key to victory, because both sides rely heavily on drones to find targets and correct artillery. Whoever can use electronic countermeasures to suppress the opponent&#39;s drones will gain an advantage in the battle. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Currently, the most efficient way to fight drones is to suppress them through electromagnetic interference, which will directly cause the drone to crash. It has been previously reported that the area near the Dnieper River has become a no-fly zone for drones, because both sides will use electronic jamming methods to suppress and interfere with the flight of drones. On this invisible battlefield, the two sides have been engaged in a very complex and cruel battle. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For nearly a century, electromagnetic interference has been an important part of warfare. Traditional electronic warfare methods are to find the radio frequencies being used by the enemy and create overwhelming noise on the same frequencies, making it impossible for the opponent to attack use. In World War II, electronic warfare mainly targeted radio communications and radar. As long as the opponent was unable to communicate and detect, the mission was completed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Modern communication technology has developed various means to combat electronic interference, but the main reason is not just for electronic warfare, but because there are a large number of electromagnetic signal sources in human society. During World War II, a 50-watt radio could easily carry out point-to-point communications in China and even East Asia. However, now it is difficult for a 50-watt radio to cover even one province - this is not because the radios back then were more advanced, but because the radios were more advanced. It was because the electromagnetic environment was good back then. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Electromagnetic communication can be regarded as a conversation between two parties. If the room is very quiet, the two parties can hear what the other party is saying without making a loud sound. If there are not only many people chatting in the room, but also people watching movies, shooting balls, playing and singing, then the two parties must raise their voices or be very close to each other when communicating. The reason why modern communication technology attaches great importance to anti-interference is because the electromagnetic background environment is too complex, making it impossible to complete communication simply by increasing power. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Software technology is also improving. For example, in the past, changing the frequency and signal characteristics of a radio station required replacing hardware. However, with the softwareization of radios, only changing the encoding can completely change the spectrum of the equipment. In other words, problems that in the past required major repairs after being interfered with can now only be solved by adding a patch to the software, or even reusing the software to replace the encryption method. In the past, to change the encryption method, each receiving end needed to change the machine. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;UAVs used in the military generally use more complex control methods to combat interference. For example, frequency hopping is used to connect back-end control, which can skip the interfered frequency band. This is commonly used in radio communications. Anti-interference means; you can also use inertial navigation in the case of interference, continue to execute the original flight path, and then connect satellite navigation and rear control when the interference weakens. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, as the ability to resist interference becomes stronger, the ability to resist interference will also become stronger accordingly. Spears and shields compete with each other and develop with each other. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Theoretically, as long as your electronic warfare capabilities are strong enough, you can construct an electronic golden bell that prevents all drones from flying in and prevents precision-guided weapons from hitting targets in the golden bell. If the interferer&#39;s equipment reaches 100% power, anti-interference methods are often difficult to work. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But the reality is that interference means cannot provide full-level signals in all areas, which depends on the location of the interference source, the orientation of the antenna and its own power. The drone is a mobile platform that can continuously fly for reconnaissance and interfere with weak signal locations to find better flight routes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;And sometimes the problem can be solved in less &quot;electronic&quot; ways, such as using radio triangulation to directly find the approximate location of the interference source, and using long-range firepower to cover the opponent, even if it misses the target. It can force the opponent to shut down temporarily to avoid the blow. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In short, there are many tactics in actual combat that can weaken the effect of the opponent&#39;s electronic interference, and these tactics themselves are also an important part of electronic warfare. Therefore, there is no omnipotent secret weapon. On the invisible battlefield of electronic warfare, only by continuously strengthening technology and constantly changing and updating countermeasures can we gain an advantage in action. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>; https://feedx.net &lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.run&quot; style=&quot;cone&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>; https: // feedx. run &lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 23 Nov 2023 18:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[冒充专家行医十年，靠秘方自制抗癌药：无证“神医”的罪与罚]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261144]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-23 17:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 23 Nov 2023 17:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[广东省人大常委会原副主任李春生受贿案一审开庭]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261154]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-23 17:08:36&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;On November 23, 2023, the Chenzhou Intermediate People’s Court of Hunan Province held a public hearing of the first instance against the Standing Committee of the Guangdong Provincial People’s Congress The bribery case involving Li Chunsheng, deputy secretary and deputy director of the Party Committee. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/23/Dy5aZvlOMRVyYAUfsfjGBCWb00SM7RUhnQLJTWZT.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;755&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/23/Dy5aZvlOMRVyYAUfsfjGBCWb00SM7RUhnQLJTWZT.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;259415&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>; The Chenzhou Municipal People’s Procuratorate alleged that from the second half of 2001 to May 2022, the defendant Li Chunsheng used his position as county magistrate and county party committee secretary of Xin County, Henan Province, deputy director of the Political Department of the Ministry of Public Security, director of the Personnel Training Bureau, deputy governor of Guangdong Province, and provincial Director of the Public Security Department, deputy secretary and deputy director of the Party Leadership Group of the Standing Committee of the Guangdong Provincial People&#39;s Congress, etc., and provide convenient conditions for the formation of authority and status to provide assistance to relevant units and individuals in matters such as business operations, project promotion, project contracting, job promotion, etc. , illegally accepting property from others, equivalent to a total of more than 79.4 million yuan in RMB.

Under the aura of Boole, Byatt once admitted in an interview with &quot;The Paris Review&quot;, &quot;Let&#39;s put it bluntly: the response to my first few books was all confused...No one paid attention to what I was doing...She wrote I wrote a lot, and I wrote fast. In the long run, it had a positive effect on me. I didn’t have the anxiety most writers have about repercussions, I just had this simple fear of being thought of as someone’s sister.”&lt;/p >; &lt;p>;In his 1967 novel The Game, Byatt tells the story of a pair of competing sisters (just two years earlier, Drabble had published a novel on a similar theme). Byatt explained that the inspiration for &quot;The Game&quot; came from a board game that her friend&#39;s sister used to play with imaginary fragments, &quot;much like Henry James&#39;s game of climbing stairs to find fragments of information.&quot; The novel is also a reference to Brown. &quot;I found the Brontë sisters&#39; solitaire imagination to be extremely terrifying.&quot; &quot;The Game&quot; also points to people&#39;s creativity in childhood. According to Byatt&#39;s recollection, when she was a child, she wrote about men in disguise sneaking into Adventures in a girls&#39; school, but &quot;most of those exercises were burned before I left boarding school.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1958, Byatt married British economist Ian Byatt (first husband, divorced in 1969), and the two lived in Durham, a city in northeastern England. It is a place where the legacy of the Middle Ages still exists. In that era, if you were a woman, they would take away the benefits they gave you for getting married, but if you were a man, they would increase it. So, there I lost my benefits, and from some hidden In a sense, I am secretly happy about it, because I actually want to be a writer rather than a scholar.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Byatt gave birth to two children after marriage, during which she gave birth to her first child. The manuscript of &quot;The Shadow of the Sun&quot; that had been put in the drawer was taken out and &quot;rewritten over and over again in a slow and unpleasant way...At the same time, one or the other baby was placed in a small chair on the desk and rocked gently with one hand. &quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1964, Byatt published her first novel &quot;The Shadow of the Sun&quot;. In her own words, &quot;a novel about a young woman at a university who wants to write a novel.&quot; In this debut novel, Byatt writes about a girl trying to escape from her controlling father. Tense family relationships and women&#39;s independent growth have since become important issues in many of her works. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;“I don’t want to belong to any group...I don’t like a spiritual guru, someone who asks you to follow or worship him.

I gave up UCL for 11 years I wrote it in two months after I started teaching. It&#39;s the only novel I&#39;ve ever written that was generally coherent, with no one getting sick, no disasters, no awards, no book promotions. It had a terrible energy, and from the first sentence to the last, the whole book was in my mind.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When it comes to Byatt, &quot;early writing&quot; means Works before &quot;Possession&quot;. In 1990, when this work became a best-seller and won the Booker Prize, Byatt finally &quot;occupied&quot; an important position in the literary world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“The creation of Possession began with the title of the book. I was sitting in the old-fashioned round table reading room of the British Museum, watching the great Coleridge scholar Catherine Coburn in the circular catalog area Walking around, a circle after a circle. I suddenly realized that she was dedicated to the dead poet in this life. I thought: Is it him &#39;possession&#39;, or she has to have a &#39; This could be written as a novel, about the &#39;possession&#39; relationship between the living and the dead. It would be a fascinating story of possession.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Possession&quot; revolves around two contemporary people. The scholar&#39;s research unfolds: a pretentious young academic and a reserved feminist. While tracing the letters exchanged between Victorian poets, the two unearthed a secret love affair of that era. Falling in love in the process...&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;The word &#39;possession&#39; also has a very direct interest level that can be discussed: who &#39;possess&#39; the manuscript of a dead writer? Moreover, &#39;possession&#39; also applied to sexual relations. At that time , I was studying the letters of Browning and his wife, and I thought of two pairs of lovers, one modern and the other ancient - the Victorians, and having them embody &#39;possession&#39; in these senses.&quot;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;The publication of &quot;Possession&quot; (full title &quot;Possession: A Romance&quot;) heralds the emergence of a &quot;new Byatt&quot;. She has great narrative talent, and the novel is full of humorous satire on the academic circle. , like a suspenseful detective story, or a touching (as its subtitle suggests) romantic legend. &quot;I originally planned to write an experimental novel, about literary theory and an ambitious biographical text... What changed everything was my reading experience of Eco&#39;s &quot;The Name of the Rose&quot; and its ironic medieval detective story... The secret I found in it is: a great story that can put whatever you need to put in it.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the text of &quot;Possession&quot;, Byatt also boldly inserts herself Poetry imitating the style of Victorian poetry. &quot;The novel required real poetry in form, but I don&#39;t write poetry. My editor at the time said: Don&#39;t be ridiculous, write it yourself! So, I went home and wrote a Victorian poem about spiders... I have always been fascinated by the poetry of Tennyson and Browning. I read it as a child because my mother was a Browning expert. Their rhymes sang in my head, and those Victorian verses just clicked in my novel. came out of nowhere.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;By the time Byatt completed Possession, publishers on both sides of the Atlantic were deeply troubled and almost sceptical. &quot;They begged me to cut out those poems and writings about the Victorian era. The only American publisher brave enough to accept it reminded me: &#39;You ruin all the suspense with these cumbersome words.&#39; Early in the morning, I cried. . Later, the novel won the Booker Prize, to everyone&#39;s surprise (including myself), it became a bestseller, and people wrote essays using my imaginary poet. &quot;Possession&quot; was translated into thirty Multiple languages. I owe Eco a huge debt.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/23/lVwV5oiE7YyAk81DJaL91Dxb3tBmm8PecdppoaHu. jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/23/lVwV5oiE7YyAk81DJaL91Dxb3tBmm8PecdppoaHu.jpg&quot; data-key= &quot;259392&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Matisse&#39;s story&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Still Life&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Byatt once said in an exclusive interview with the New York Times: &quot;I am not an academic who accidentally wrote a novel. In fact, I happen to be a moderately academic novelist.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Byatt&#39;s early literary creations were modeled after George Eliot and Iris Murdoch. Like the former, she regards novels as an ideal art form because &quot;you can absorb the whole world from them&quot;; influenced by the latter, she tries to portray characters who are entangled and struggling with various ideas; at the same time, following the example of her two predecessors, she admires Utter writes dense, detailed novels that are challenging to read even for her smart, patient fans. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;The difficulty lies in the fact that sentences like this can be seen everywhere: a dense collection of unknown knowledge and the author&#39;s delicate and rigorous subjective feelings; specialized terms in the fields of classics, mythology and art are randomly picked up... ...long sentences contain alternating long and short clauses...familiar words have long-abandoned meanings or obscure meanings.&quot; Yang Xiangrong, the translator of Byatt&#39;s works, once &quot;complained&quot; that the translation of &quot;The Virgin in the Garden&quot; was difficult, But I was impressed, &quot;When I read it for the second time, I gradually fell in love with the complex and regular language style, the unremitting capture of subtleties, and the almost aristocratic style of writing in which the writer never creates simple sentences.

I suddenly realized that I had experienced a certain period. History.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Byatt set the background of &quot;The Virgin in the Garden&quot; in 1953, when Queen Elizabeth II ascended the throne. In the very short time span from rehearsal, performance to completion of a historical drama, Bo The three children of the Te family have undergone fundamental changes. The eldest daughter Stephanie got married and had a child, the 18-year-old second daughter Frederica lost her virginity, and the youngest son Marcus was deceived and became insane... They all experienced dangerous growth. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the beginning of the novel, Byatt begins with &quot;National Portrait Gallery: 1968&quot;, &quot;I experienced the early 1950s. I lived in the 1960s, and I don&#39;t regard the 1960s as A time for a revolution, but as a time when I can look back on the history in which I lived... What is personal is not political, although the participants in politics are individuals. Politics is not personal at all.&quot;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;In 1972, Byatt&#39;s son Charles, who was just over 11 years old, died suddenly in a car accident on his way to school. After losing her beloved son, she experienced landslides and ice cracks in her life. She wrote a sentence at the end of the prologue of the novel. A woman whose son was seriously injured in the collision said, &quot;That woman used to be a good teacher, but not anymore. She used to have many friends, but now she doesn&#39;t have them.

The English title of the novel &quot;Still Life&quot; is interpreted literally - &quot;still life&quot; - that is, death. In the book, Byatt once lamented through the mouth of a character: &quot;Perhaps, we can also look at still life in this way. The so-called still life painting is synonymous with natural death.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I have already conceived it. Stephanie&#39;s death in 1961. I thought I was going to write a series of novels in which I would make that death a central awareness, so that readers would feel the pain of a real death, as you did, rather than having to deal with a real death. A fictional death. Every two or three months I get a letter from a reader saying, how dare you do this to me. I sit down and cry all night long.

Is such low-quality competition really conducive to the long-term development of domestic jewelry companies? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/23/wGz3dhhd4CDXkvhPLQvgDrkH4GxKYoxNfI5u1tMC.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/23/wGz3dhhd4CDXkvhPLQvgDrkH4GxKYoxNfI5u1tMC.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;259328&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; >;&lt;strong>;Robbing for the surname &quot;Zhou&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Many consumers who don’t know much about gold brands have inevitably encountered such confusion: Why do so many gold companies have the surname &quot;Zhou&quot;? For example, Chow Tai Fook, Chow Sang Sang, Chow Tai Sang, Saturday Fook, Chow Jin Sang, Chow Pak Fook, Chow Fu Sang... In fact, the founders of many of them are not named &quot;Chow&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Chow Tai Fook is a well-known old brand. As early as 1929, Chow Tai Fook&#39;s founder Zhou Zhiyuan founded the first &quot;Chow Tai Fook Gold Store&quot; on Hongde Road, Guangzhou, mainly selling traditional gold jewelry. In the 1930s, due to the current situation, Zhou Zhiyuan moved Chow Tai Fook Bank from Guangzhou to Macau, and later opened a branch in Hong Kong. In 2011, Chow Tai Fook was listed in Hong Kong. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Chow Sang Sang is also an old brand, and the founder is also named Zhou. In 1934, Shunde native Zhou Fangpu founded Jinhang in Guangzhou. From the 1930s to the 1940s, Chow Sang Sang had opened many branches in Hong Kong and Macao. Chow Sang Sang was listed in 1973. It was the first listed gold and jewelry company in Hong Kong. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Chow Tai Sang was established much later than Chow Tai Fook and Chow Sang Sang. It opened its first counter in Wangfujing Department Store in Beijing in 1999 and was listed on the Shenzhen Main Board in 2017. The founder of Zhou Dasheng, Zhou Zongwen, is from Fuqing, Fujian Province, but his surname is indeed &quot;Zhou&quot;, so there is nothing wrong with naming the gold bank Zhou Dasheng. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Saturday Fu&#39;s surname is &quot;Zhou&quot;, which has caused a lot of controversy. In 2004, Li Weipeng and Chen Chuangjin jointly invested in the establishment of Saturday Fortune. In 2005, Chen Chuangjin transferred 50% of the equity held by Li Weipeng to Li Weizhu, Li Weipeng&#39;s brother. In other words, the founder and current head of Saturday Fortune is named &quot;Li&quot;. The name of Luk Fook will also cause consumers to confuse it with &quot;Luk Fook Jewelry&quot;. Lukfook Jewelry was established in Hong Kong in 1991 and listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in 1997. It is more senior than Lukfook. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Some jewelry brands named &quot;Zhou&quot; that appeared after 2000 did not have founders named Zhou. For example, the founders of Zhou Jinsheng are surnamed Li, the founders of Zhou Baifu are surnamed Ye, and the founders of Zhou Fusheng are surnamed Zheng... The founders of these brands must be well aware of whether there is a motive for &quot;taking advantage of&quot; the brand. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Grab the surname &quot;Zhou&quot;, reflects a dilemma of domestic jewelry brands: there is still a lack of real jewelry brands in China, and consumers have failed to do some. Some brands generate real loyalty. Gold banks look similar, and consumers don’t care that much. This gives those who “fake” the brand an opportunity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/23/3q8lLZ1kdijbLfTD5NOyZfbGST9i21Ndx4qJPKzJ.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/23/3q8lLZ1kdijbLfTD5NOyZfbGST9i21Ndx4qJPKzJ.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;259329&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; >;&lt;strong>;Seize for the sinking market&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Not only are they competing for the surname &quot;Zhou&quot;, China&#39;s major gold banks are also competing for the market. This time, the employees of Zhou Taisheng and Lao Fengxiang fought over soliciting business, which is a microcosm of the current situation of jewelry brands competing for the sinking market. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Whether it is Lao Fengxiang, China Gold, or a group of gold banks named &quot;Zhou&quot;, they have opened stores in the sinking market. Some netizens posted that their hometown is a small county, but “seven or eight gold stores have opened on one street.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Chow Tai Fook&#39;s first quarter financial report of this year shows that in the first quarter, Chow Tai Fook opened 248 new retail points in the mainland. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Chow Tai Sang&#39;s financial report shows that as of the first quarter of 2023, the number of Chow Tai Sang&#39;s terminal stores has increased by a net of 133 stores compared with the end of the same period last year, and by a net increase of 21 stores from the beginning of the year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;China Gold&#39;s 2023 first quarter financial report shows that China Gold added 21 direct-operated stores and 325 franchise stores in the first quarter; Chow Sang Sang also predicted in the financial report , the group will have a net increase of approximately 100 branches in 2023. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Most of these branches are in third- and fourth-tier cities. For example, in 2022, more than half of Chow Tai Fook&#39;s new stores will be located in sinking markets, and the proportion of retail value in third-tier, fourth-tier and other cities has reached one-third. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The reason why we target the sinking market is that on the one hand, the gold and jewelry market in first- and second-tier cities has gradually become saturated, and there is no shortage of gold banks and gold stores. Expand market share and begin to extend to lower-tier markets. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On the other hand, in addition to investment and self-wear, a very critical part of the consumer demand for jewelry is wedding demand. In small counties, there are customary requirements for &quot;three golds&quot; (gold necklaces, gold rings, gold earrings) or &quot;hardwares&quot; (gold bracelets and gold headdresses are added to the &quot;three golds&quot;) for weddings. Gold consumption of 10,000 yuan is &quot;standard&quot; in many places. This is a big cake. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;However, the sinking of gold brands has also brought new problems. The first thing to bear the brunt is brand management. Many new stores are franchise stores of the brand. The management level of the franchisees varies. Once a problem occurs, it becomes a brand problem and has an impact on the brand image. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;What is even more embarrassing is that for consumers in the sinking market, whether you are the senior Lao Fengxiang, Chow Tai Fook, the much younger Chow Tai Seng, or the local There is no fundamental difference between some &quot;no-name&quot; gold banks. Consumers &quot;buy whichever one is cheaper&quot;. Anyway, they are all gold, so whoever you buy is not buying. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Therefore, the &quot;business war&quot; of gold banks in the sinking market sometimes involves simply and crudely grabbing customers, which may lead to conflicts. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Need to work hard on craftsmanship and brand management&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;No matter Whether they are competing for the surname &quot;Zhou&quot; or the outrageous conflicts caused by low-quality competition, they have jointly exposed the common dilemma of domestic gold brands: the brand premium is not high, consumers&#39; brand loyalty is not high, and competition is still in the &quot;reckless&quot; stage. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Precisely because the brand premium is not high, the profit margins of domestic gold brands are not high. No matter how the gold price outside rises, buying gold at a gold bank only adds a labor fee to the gold price. According to industry analysis, the retail gross profit margin of gold is 10%-20%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;As for profit margins, they are even lower. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;For example, Lao Fengxiang&#39;s first quarter financial report for 2023 shows that during the reporting period, the company achieved total operating income of 24.558 billion yuan, net profit attributable to the parent company of 716 million yuan, and a profit margin of 2.9%; China Gold’s operating income in the first quarter of 2023 was 16.139 billion yuan, net profit attributable to the parent company was 300 million yuan, and the profit margin was 1.86%...&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In comparison , some foreign luxury jewelry brands, such as Tiffany, Bulgari, and Van Cleef &amp; Arpels, have enviable retail gross profit margins, which can reach 50%-60%. The materials used are obviously ordinary materials that are cheaper than gold, but the price is eye-popping, and consumers still flock to it. Labeling consumers as &quot;foolish people with too much money&quot; is just the self-comfort of those who are lagging behind. Domestic gold brands need to face the gap head-on. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Where do these luxury brands “win”? On the one hand, luxury brand craftsmanship and innovation have elements of originality and originality. For example, Van Cleef &amp; Arpels&#39; &quot;Four-Leaf Clover&quot; series has become a hit because of its classics. Domestic gold brands have also been exploring craftsmanship in recent years. For example, Chow Tai Fook&#39;s &quot;ancient gold&quot; is very popular among young consumers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Unfortunately, following the trend in China is still too serious. Nowadays, almost every mainstream gold brand has an ancient gold series, and the distinction between brands is even worse. Disappeared. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The other is the continuous cultivation of brand image. Nowadays, many gold brands co-brand with brands that young people like, such as Harry Potter and Zootopia. This is of course one way, but the co-branding itself relies more on the power of other brands and cannot be converted into the value of its own brand. . Consumers will buy co-branded models, but they will not become loyal users of gold brands. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In the final analysis, to enhance brand power, we must avoid short-sightedness, avoid eagerness for quick success, avoid following the trend, be calm, sit back, and work hard on craftsmanship. Enhance the artistry and sense of nobility of the brand, making it difficult for other brands to copy it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Otherwise, if you blindly follow the trend, blindly expand the market and open franchises, it may seem that you have a large market share, but in fact, you will still earn money through hard work. fee. In the end, no matter how fierce the &quot;fight&quot; is, consumers will still buy the cheaper one - and your &quot;fight&quot; is in vain. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 23 Nov 2023 14:25:04 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
