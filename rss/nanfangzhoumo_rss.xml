(Photo courtesy of interviewee)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among the PhDs interviewed, Zeng Zhiping may be the last to obtain a PhD. In January 2007, he graduated early from China University of Political Science and Law and became China&#39;s first doctor of military law - 24 years had passed since the first batch of doctors trained after the reform and opening up were awarded degrees. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, as a secondary discipline under the category of law, the process of military law becoming a discipline is relatively late. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1984, legal scholars Zhang Youyu and Pan Nianzhi first proposed that military law is a branch of the legal system in the &quot;Encyclopedia of China·Law Volume&quot;; three years later, in May 1987, the former State Education Commission Military law was officially listed as a branch discipline of law; in 1993, the Military Law Department of Xi&#39;an Political College (now the Xi&#39;an Campus of the Political College of the National Defense University of the Chinese People&#39;s Liberation Army), the country&#39;s first teaching institution specializing in military legal education, was established, marking the establishment of the Department of Military Law. Military law professional education is officially on the right track. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2003, Xi&#39;an Political College became the first school with the right to award a doctorate in military law; in the same year, China University of Political Science and Law opened a military law research center. In 2004, China University of Political Science and Law began to recruit doctoral students in military law. Also in this year, Zeng Zhiping, who had the rank of lieutenant colonel, transferred from Nanchang Army College and was admitted to China University of Political Science and Law in September of the same year, becoming the only doctoral student in military law enrolled that year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zeng Zhiping studied under Professor Zhou Jian, a well-known expert in the field of military law and the first director of the Military Law Teaching and Research Office in China. Zhou Jian once pointed out in an article: &quot;Among the top ten legal disciplines identified by the Ministry of Education, military law (030110) can be said to be the one with the least talents and the most difficult to research.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Compared with law Among other majors, military law is a relatively mysterious and niche subject. Before changing careers, Zeng Zhiping worked in the army for 21 years. In a sense, it was his status as a soldier that gave him the opportunity to specialize in military law. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Zeng Zhiping’s view, today’s “openness” of military law is related to the atmosphere of the rule of law and the society’s demand for military legal talents. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Military academy, army, and then to military academy&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 凯体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>; In 1984, you were admitted to Nanchang Army College (now the Army Infantry College of the Chinese People&#39;s Liberation Army) as an undergraduate student. Why did you choose a military school at that time? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Zeng Zhiping: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;In our time, especially in rural areas, everyone’s life was not guaranteed. The ones with relatively better treatment were the military. . When I graduated from high school, I participated in the military draft. At that time, I was recruited to be a pilot, and the requirements were relatively high. I was rejected during the physical examination. When Nanchang Army Academy came to recruit students, the head teacher recommended me. I didn’t have any particularly strong ideas at the time, but my father thought it would be good to be an officer, so he went for it. If you want to say that I have any strong (ideas) towards the military or officers, I don’t think I have any. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;What is special about undergraduate education in military academies? ? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Zeng Zhiping:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Before I went to the military academy, I didn’t know much about the military or the military academy, but physical training was the most beneficial thing for me in the military academy. When I first went to school, I couldn&#39;t do any pull-ups. The school organized physical training, and during the training process, I made the fastest progress. Later, I became an all-around athlete in school and also participated in military sports competitions. Some of the teachers are from the army and will teach tactics, shooting, military fitness, formation and the like. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 凯体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;After graduating from Nanchang Army Academy, what did you do Which jobs? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Zeng Zhiping: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;After graduation, I was sent to the front-line army in Zhangzhou, Fujian. At that time, I was a platoon leader in a regiment. After a few months, I was transferred to the agency. During the training of all division cadres, the instructor of one training subject did not demonstrate accurately, so the regiment leader &quot;picked&quot; me out. Later, I became an instructor for many projects. This (experience) made me stand out. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I have been in the front-line army for four and a half years. I have served as an officer in the Organizational Section of the Political Department and as an instructor. After the Lantern Festival in 1993, I was transferred to Nanchang Army Academy to teach, which I applied for on my own initiative. At that time, I went to the Marxist-Leninist Teaching and Research Office, and the director of the Military Teaching and Research Office asked me: &quot;Why don&#39;t you come to me?&quot; He was my instructor when I was a student. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In school, I taught Introduction to International Politics when I first arrived because there were relatively few teachers taking this course at that time. I was also interested in the introduction to law class, and after one semester, I was teaching introduction to law. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Discipline Positioning&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Why will you continue? Study law on your own? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Zeng Zhiping: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;It’s a bit of a coincidence that something happened in the spring of 1993 that had a great impact on college students across the country: the International College Debate Competition , the one Jiang Changjian and the others participated in. It was really interesting for us to watch this competition at that time. Jiang Changjian majored in National Politics, so I wanted to go to Fudan to study for a graduate degree in International Politics. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But later at school, I learned that several young men we hung out with were preparing to take the bar exam. I felt that this matter was definitely the right thing to do. After weighing it, I said that I would study law instead of international politics. International politics is a &quot;dragon-slaying art&quot; and law is more practical. In 1994, I began to study law on my own in accordance with the requirements of the bar qualification examination syllabus. In October of that year, I ranked first in the military and qualified as a lawyer. &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(Southern Weekend Note: The national judicial examination system had not yet been established at that time, and you could obtain lawyer qualifications by passing the bar qualification examination.)&lt;/span>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;When I took the postgraduate entrance examination, I was not afraid of majors related to law. Because I had already passed the bar exam and my brain was good at that time, I thought I could pass the exam for any major. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You already teach in a military academy, why do you want to study for a master&#39;s degree? ? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Zeng Zhiping:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I had not thought about leaving the army at that time, but I did want to leave Nanchang Army Academy. Many professors in the school are older. I feel that if I don’t leave the school, I may not be as good as them when I get older. However, it is still relatively difficult to transfer to the army. The postgraduate entrance examination is a means of leaving school. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I wanted to take the international law major at Wuhan University, but someone told me that if you study as a graduate student at a local university, you have to go back to your original school after graduation, because it is impossible for local universities to You stay. So I chose Xi&#39;an Political College, which is also a military school. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Now that I think about it, if I had gone to Wuhan University from the beginning, my academic foundation might have been more reliable. If I received systematic academic training when I was young and read a lot of books, then my most source knowledge would be complete and my academic research would have a beginning and an end. My current knowledge cannot reach this level, which is a lifelong regret of mine. Now I mainly feel that my years have been wasted. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;When you were studying for a master&#39;s degree, what did you know about military law? Do you have any idea about what kind of disciplines and what kind of problems are to be solved? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Zeng Zhiping: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;This is true because I have a background in law. I have read a lot of materials before and also studied military law. In my master&#39;s degree, my direction is military justice, mainly studying the military prosecutorial system. What impressed me most was that I read a lot of English materials at that time and discussed with some famous professors the structure of criminal theory of the three levels of German and Japanese criminal law. This also had a great influence on me. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You developed a love for military law during your Ph.D. ? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Zeng Zhiping: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I can’t say it’s love. I just accumulated knowledge to a certain extent and have an understanding of this subject. On the other hand, I see a lot of work that is poorly written. I feel that my participation in this subject may make it better. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Let’s go back to discuss the positioning of the discipline of military law Question, do you think it belongs to the branch of military science or the branch of law? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Zeng Zhiping: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;It depends on how you treat belonging. This issue can be discussed from the subject management of the Ministry of Education, from the professional fields involved in the subject, and from the classification of knowledge. I only recognize the classification of knowledge. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;In June 2022, Wenzheng College of Suzhou University, Zeng Zhiping (fifth from left) is with students.

At that time, I returned to Nanchang and took an introduction to law class at school. Because there were several teachers taking the same course, I could only attend a few classes in one semester. In addition to taking classes at the military academy, I was also teaching part-time at several private universities. It can be said that teaching has nourished my psychology. In private universities, many students look at you with hungry and passionate eyes, which is different from what I encountered at my original school. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Then why did you go to China University of Political Science and Law? Where&#39;s Beau? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Zeng Zhiping: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;This is a bit of a coincidence. I had always wanted to change my job before the Spring Festival in 2004, but at that time the unit leader had not announced our job. There is news that I can change my job, I am just applying. At that time, I saw the information about various schools recruiting Ph.D.s, and I was thinking, &quot;Will it be approved (for career change) this year?&quot; Around January 10, 2004, after my application for job change was approved, I quickly checked the admissions information of various schools. I had always wanted to go to Wuhan University, but the registration had closed at that time. However, that year, because the Chinese Political Science and Law added a new doctoral program in military law, its registration period was extended, so I signed up. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When looking at school admissions information, I will also consult some teachers. I met Teacher Zhou Jian when I was studying at Xi&#39;an Political College, and I called him. I originally wanted to major in criminal law, and I have been teaching criminal law. Then teacher Zhou Jian said, you don’t want to major in criminal law. I teach military law in China’s political and legal field, so you can study military law with me. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I also told Teacher Zhou, &quot;I have changed careers, why should I study military law? I am still more interested in criminal law.&quot; Therefore, military law is really a product of the times, and I am also a product of the times. It is a coincidence. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Was the competition fierce to apply for a doctorate in military law at China University of Political Science and Law? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Zeng Zhiping:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;At that time, China University of Political Science and Law had three professors who could teach PhD students in military law, but that year only Professor Zhou Jian enrolled students, and the quota only one person. I was particularly impressed. There were 10 people who signed up at that time. I also checked the scores of other candidates using the score checking rules. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The rule for checking scores at that time was to just enter your admission ticket number. According to the numbering method of the admission ticket number, the first digits are the same, and the difference is in the last single digits and tens digits. Based on where we were in the exam room at that time, I could probably guess how many people were in front of me and behind me. After I checked my scores, I guessed their numbers, and I actually found out my scores. Seeing that the second place was 20 points lower than me, I felt more relaxed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;How will it be for you to get a doctorate from China University of Political Science and Law? Something more important? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Zeng Zhiping: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Yes, this is a very important turning point in life. At that time, I changed my career and had a doctorate in military law. Teacher Zhou said, China’s political and legal affairs will definitely keep you, so my life plan at that time had a general direction. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When I was studying for my master&#39;s degree, I once went to Beijing. While reading in the Beijing Library, I met an old gentleman. He went to an event at Peking University and we had a brief chat. He said something to the effect of &quot;If I can go to Peking University to be a professor in this life, I can do whatever I want.&quot; I had a very imaginary idea at that time: It would be great if I could become a professor of political science and law in China, so sometimes life is very strange. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, there were some changes later, and I did not stay at China University of Political Science and Law after graduation. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Cognition is the core of personality&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You Studying for a master&#39;s degree is to leave the original school; studying for a doctorate is to stay in a new school. So these choices you made were not based on professional choices? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Zeng Zhiping: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Yes, I have always wanted to teach in a better university, but people are like duckweeds of the times. My current thoughts may be more mature thoughts, because my career is nearing the &quot;end&quot;. I think it is like this: you need to go to school, your school, the teachers and classmates you meet should work together to help you find your interests in life. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So I think an ideal society should be one where everyone is encouraged to do what you want to do and find your interests and passions. If every young person&#39;s growth is to learn based on his own love, then this will enhance his love. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;&quot;The first doctor of military law after the founding of New China&quot; label, for Has it had a big impact on your life? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Zeng Zhiping: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I didn’t realize this when I graduated. In 2007, my son was going to take the college entrance examination. My simple thought was, can I graduate early? If I stay in China Political Science and Law, it will be very convenient for my son to go to school in Beijing. But my son didn&#39;t think it was necessary. He got good grades and was admitted to Wuhan University. But I finished my thesis and graduated half a year ahead of schedule. I didn’t mean to be the first. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I passed the graduation thesis defense in the morning, and the &quot;Legal Daily&quot; reported it in the afternoon. Later, some foreign media also followed up and reported the matter. It still seems very interesting now. I don’t know if the foreign media paid attention to the first doctorate in other disciplines, but at that time many foreign media reported on me and even mentioned the title of my thesis &quot;On Military Power&quot; and said that I was interested in Such a major theoretical issue is well researched. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I haven’t told anyone about this label myself. Now that I have to say it has brought me any special benefits, I don’t think it has. After all, I haven’t used it to apply for a job. Or do some publicity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;After graduating with your Ph.D., you applied for Nanchang Institute of Technology and were ordered to establish Nanchang Institute of Technology Department of Political Science and Law, College. Compared with the “five colleges and four departments” in the legal world, what do you think the law department of a private university should look like? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Zeng Zhiping:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I came to Nanchang Institute of Technology in 2007 and received the National Social Science Fund in 2008. At that time, there were only a dozen colleges and universities with law departments and law majors in Jiangxi, so it had a great impact. For a long time, the school regarded me as a signature. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In terms of undergraduate education, I am very conscious. I have not included military law in the professional courses of law undergraduates. I have only made it a public elective course for the whole school. It would be very shameless if you become the head of the department or the dean of the law school and then turn your own courses into professional courses, compile textbooks, and ask people to buy your books. Until now, I have not compiled a textbook on military law. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I started the courses based on the most basic law undergraduate major. If there is anything special about it, it can be said that I taught several very important general courses: general logic, grammar and rhetoric, introduction to political science, introduction to sociology, etc. At that time, these courses were not available in law schools. universal. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2016, we became the construction unit for the master&#39;s degree awarding project in Jiangxi Province, which was issued by the relevant units. I want students to receive a good education, which can also be regarded as a relatively direct achievement at work. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, the sense of accomplishment I get from teaching also gives me the motivation to continue. Why do I keep teaching? It&#39;s because I think there are many mistakes now, and teaching is also wrong teaching.

Some even It can be directly converted into fans and platform revenue on social media platforms,” she said. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Nandu reporters saw from Zhang Yong’s “Buyer Show” that there were many enthusiastic orders from various companies. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>; &quot;The psychological demands of companies for celebrities to record videos are more pure. There is no relationship demand, but mainly interest demands.&quot; Huang Guiping explained that in fact, it is to take advantage of the celebrity&#39;s popularity and Public trust endorses one&#39;s products, brands, and company image, reducing the public&#39;s doubts and uncertainty when purchasing its products. &quot;This kind of &#39;bringing goods&#39; is relatively risky for celebrities.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sun Peng (pseudonym) is the manager of a well-known domestic female talent show team. He told Nandu reporters that he usually tells the artists directly that the company has clear regulations that do not allow recording of these blessing videos. &quot;In my opinion, these incomes are not scientific.&quot; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At work, he will strictly distinguish the nature of video recording. &quot;For example, for holiday blessings or cultural promotion, we will charge &#39;travel fees&#39; for recording as appropriate. &lt;span>;But if you record a video for a company, it is a proper business behavior. Our requirements will be higher and we will not just record it easily.&quot;&lt; /span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Nandu reporters found that sellers who sell celebrity blessing videos often do not only engage in this business. Celebrity business endorsements, rummage videos, commercial performances, group photos... In the profiles they showed, various celebrity-related businesses emerged one after another. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/23/0a3fdad9e43324b8f07be87f08edae13.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; OPACITY: 1; &quot;Width =&quot; 800 &quot;Height =&quot; 1068 &quot;Data-src =&quot; // Images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/23/0A33324B87F08Edae13.je13.je13.je13.je13.je13.je peg &quot;data-key =&quot; 259402 &quot;>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style =&quot; color: #999999; text-align: center; &quot;>; &lt;span>; seller shows the star recording blessing video business case. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;span>; &quot;They often have commissions.&quot; Sun Peng revealed to Nantu reporter, &quot;In fact, the fixed salary of artist agents is not high, and sometimes it depends on others to make commissions for others to make commissions. Or return. But everyone has their own life, it is not easy to evaluate the quality of this phenomenon. &quot;&lt;/Span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>; &lt;strong>; &lt;span>; Risk: Stars may need to bear legal responsibility &lt;/&lt;/ Span>; &lt;/strong>; &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; &lt;span>; Star recording blessing video, seemingly commercial transactions that can be achieved by moving the mouth, in fact, there is a hidden risk that cannot be ignored. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;span>; If the birthday occasion, the star hinders the videos of blessings or charges, generally does not violate public order and customs, but if it involves the nature of the platform, &quot;endorsement&quot;, it cannot be understood simply For &quot;one party is willing to give money, one party can shoot &lt;/span>;&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The lawyer Wang Jiaxin, a lawyer of Guangdong Guangxin Junda Law Firm, analyzed to Nandu reporters that providing blessings for individuals can be regarded as a fan economic behavior. This form is not a civil legal act, and it does not actually cause legal interests. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; But if the stars shoot blessings for enterprises or products, because the star has celebrity effects, such videos are actually implying or explicitly showing the behavior of the advertising language &lt;span>; Enterprises and products should be widely promoted. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;span>; &quot;Therefore, such videos are advertising endorsement behaviors. If the company involved in the videos is suspected of illegal business and the star knows the business Responsibility. Wang Jiaxin said. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;span>; When a number of stars were exposed to recording a life video for the northern Burma electrical scammer, many netizens questioned, &quot;How many innocent people have the electronic scam head, why do you want to be for the people? He celebrates his birthday? &quot;&lt;/SPAN>; &lt;/P>; &lt;p>; &lt;span>;&quot; But if these blessings were exposed to the leader of electrical fraud, netizens&#39; reports were not established because it was a personal blessing video, and Do not target the company. &quot;Wang Jiaxin further explained that if the star wishes the video emphasizes the electrical fraud company, it is necessary to prove that the star knows the company&#39;s suspected electrical fraud, such as whether the star participates in the company&#39;s operation or holds the company&#39;s shares, but It is generally more difficult to proof. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Sun Peng, the agent of a well -known domestic draft female group agent, also felt that recording blessing videos such as &quot;irregular cooperation forms&quot; will increase the hidden dangers of the artist&#39;s own risk. . At the same time, he also admits that sometimes companies spend millions of yuan to invite artists to participate in the promotion and endorsement of the brand. During the promotion, it is actually difficult for artists to refuse the company&#39;s request for taking photos and recording videos. Once agreed, follow -up photos and videos will be used by the other party, and the results are uncontrollable. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;&quot; Before the relevant laws and regulations and policy provisions are issued, the star shooting congratulations video will indeed be in a gray area, so it will bring what we say &#39;&#39; &#39;&#39; Conflying money or not. &quot;The communication expert Huang Guiping told Nantu reporter that when lacking norms and regulation, celebrities, enterprises, and consumers are in a state of lack of guarantee, which may cause a lot of losses. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;span>; &quot;Therefore, when the relevant departments are rectified, the star is aware of the consumption of its own image, or the company realizes that Any kind of situation may make the &quot;star blessing video chaos&quot; relieved. &quot;Huang Guiping said. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 23 Nov 2023 19:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[俄乌电子战，矛与盾的游戏丨军事]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261148]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;i>; 2023-11-23 18:00:00 &lt;/i>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>; &lt;img src = &quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 11/22/zqimxe6gdbusruqozil5lmqgept8wqnfadczbvy9.jpg &quot;border =&quot; 0 &quot;width =&quot; 1795 &quot;height =&quot; 1200 &quot;data-src =&quot; // Images.infzm/ms/medias/ Image/23/11/22/zqimxe6gdbusruqozil5lmqgept8wqnfadczbvy9. jpg &quot;data-key =&quot; 259199 &quot;>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style =&quot; color: #999; text-align: center; &quot;>; November 16, 2023, the Donetsk area, the Ukrainian army no one The machine operator is trained at the place not far from the front line. The soldiers drove out of the East Bank of the Hermuson area in the occupied Hermuson area and established a number of bridgeheads. Russia also recognized for the first time that the Kiev Army had crossed the Dieber River. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Of course, this is the result worthy of attention, because the establishment of bridgeheads on the east bank of the Dieber River is very threatening to Crimea. It&#39;s hard to stick to it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; General Zaluigani, commander of the Ukrainian armed forces, emphasized in an interview with Economist that Ukraine needs to develop and deploy its own advanced technology to regain the upper hand in the war, behind the establishment of the bridgehead. It is the tactical advantage brought about by a series of technology renewal, especially the advantages of electronic confrontation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; After the outbreak of the Russian and Ukraine War, Ukraine has been fighting invisible electronic confrontation with Russia. The battle in Hermone is the forefront of this confrontation, because both sides can often only be used across the river through the river. The long -range firepower was bombarded, so the drone became the key to winning, because both sides rely on the drone to discover the target and correct the artillery. Whoever can use electronic confrontation to suppress the other drone of the other will gain an advantage in the battle. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; At present, the most effective way to fight the drone is to suppress the other party through electromagnetic interference, which directly leads to the crash of the drone. Earlier, there have been reports that the Diren River has become a forbidden area of ​​the drone, because both sides will use electronic interference to suppress interference to fly drone flight. In this invisible battlefield, the two sides have been in a very complicated and cruel battle. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In the past century, electromagnetic interference has been an important part of the war. Traditional electronic warfare means to find the radio frequency that the enemy is using, and to create an overwhelming noise at the same frequency, making it impossible for the other party use. During World War II, the electronic war was mainly aimed at radio communication and radar. As long as the other party could not communicate and detect, even the task was completed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Modern communication technology has developed various means of confrontation electronic interference, but the main reason is not just for electronic warfare, but because of a large number of electromagnetic signal sources in human society. During World War II, a 50 -watt -power radio station could easily communicate with point -to -point communication in China and even East Asia. It was because the electromagnetic environment of that year was good. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; You can think of electromagnetic communication as a conversation between the two parties. If a room is very quiet, the two parties can hear each other what the other person is talking about. If there are not only many people chatting in the room, there are also people watching movies, some people are shooting the ball, and some people are singing and singing, then the communication between the two sides must improve the voice or be very close. The reason why modern communication technology attaches great importance to anti -interference is because the electromagnetic background environment is too complicated, which has caused simply relying on the power to complete the communication. It has become an impossible task. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Software technology is also increasing. For example, in the past, the frequency and signal characteristics of a radio station need to change the hardware. With the software of radio, you only need to change the code to make the spectrum of the device completely change. In other words, the problems that need to be repaired after being disturbed in the past. Now you only need to add a patch to the software, and you can even replace the encryption method with the software. In the past, if you want to replace the encryption method, you need to replace the machine for each receiver. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Military useless drones generally use more complex control methods to fight interference. For example Anti -interference means; inertia navigation can also be used under interference, continuing to execute the original flight path, and then connecting satellite navigation and rear control when the interference is weakened. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Of course, the ability to resist interference becomes stronger, the ability to interference will also become stronger, and the spear and the shield will compete with each other and develop each other. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Theoretically, as long as your electronic warfare ability is strong enough, you can build an electronic golden bell cover so that all drones cannot fly in, and precise guidance of weapons cannot hit the target of the golden bell cover. If the interference equipment reaches 100%power, the anti -interference method is often difficult to work. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; But the actual situation is that the interference method cannot be a full -level signal in all areas, which depends on the position of the interference source, the antenna orientation and its own power. UAV is a mobile platform that can constantly fly reconnaissance and interfere with weak signals, so as to find a better flight route. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; and sometimes some less &quot;electronic&quot; methods can be used to solve the problem.

No one paid attention to what I was doing ... she wrote it ... There are a lot of writing. In the long run, this has a positive impact on me. I do n’t have the anxiety of most writers on response. I only have this simple fear: I am afraid of being regarded as a sister of someone. &quot;&lt;/P >; &lt;p>; In the novel &quot;Game&quot; published in 1967, Bayeut described a pair of competing sisters (just two years ago, Drabul also published novels similar to the theme). Bayeut explained that the inspiration of &quot;Game&quot; comes from her friend&#39;s younger sister often imagined a chessboard game, &quot;very much like Henry James mentioned the game of climbing stairs to search for information fragments&quot;, this novel is also for Bronz The realistic depiction of the special sister&#39;s creation life, &quot;I found that the Dragon Dragon&#39;s imagination of Sister Bronte was terrible.&quot; &quot;Game&quot; also pointed to the creativity of people in childhood. According to Byeut&#39;s memories, she wrote a man dressing in a dress when she was young. The adventure story of the women&#39;s school, but those practices were &quot;burned before I left the boarding school.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In 1958, Byeut married British economist Ian Bayeut (the first husband, divorced in 1969). It is a place where the Chinese heritage still exists. At that time, if you were a woman, they would take away the treatment of you because of marriage. In terms of meaning, I am happy for this, because I actually want to be a writer, not a scholar. &quot;&lt;/P>; &lt;p>; There are two children after the marriage of worship. In the meantime, she will first The manuscript of the &quot;Shadow of the Sun&quot; put it in the drawer, &quot;Repeat repeatedly in some slow and unhappy way ... At the same time, put one or the other baby in a small chair on a desk, shaking gently. &quot;&lt;/P>; &lt;p>; In 1964, Bayeut published the first minister of the novel&quot; The Shadow of the Sun &quot;, in her own words,&quot; A novel about a young woman in a university wants to write a novel &quot;,&quot; In this debut, Bayet wrote a girl trying to escape from the desire to escape from the desire. The intense family relationship, the independent growth of women, have become important issues of her many works. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &amp; nbsp; &quot;I don&#39;t want to belong to any group ... I don&#39;t like spiritual mentors, those who ask you to follow or worship him. I like the kind of people who let you think independently.&quot; &lt;/ P>; &lt;H4>; &lt;strong>; Is he &quot;possessing&quot; her or &quot;possessing&quot; him &lt;/strong>; &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; &quot;I have conceived for 15 years. After the teaching position, I wrote it for two months. This is my only novel that was made in a whole. No one was sick, no disaster, no awards, and no book promotion. It has a terrible energy. From the beginning of writing the first sentence to the last sentence, the whole book is in my mind. &quot;&lt;/P>; &lt;p>; When it comes to Bayeut,&quot; early creation &quot;means Writing before the possession. In 1990, after this work was sold in the world and the Guibak Award, Bayet finally &quot;possessed&quot; an important seat in the literary world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;The creation of&quot; possession &quot;starts from the title of the book. I sit in the old -fashioned round table reading room of the British Museum, watching the great scholar Catherine Ken Ben who studied the great scholar who studied the ruling of Corcele Walking around, a circle after a circle. I suddenly realized that she was dedicated to the dead poet in this life. I thought: Is it him &#39;possession&#39;, or she has to have a &#39; This should be written as a novel, about the &quot;possession&quot; relationship between the living and the deceased. This will be a fascinating story attached. &quot; Scholars&#39; research: A self -sufficient young school, a restrained feminist, and the two discovered a secret situation of that era when tracking Victorian poets. Falling in love in the process ... &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;The word&quot; possession &#39;also has a very direct level of interest to discuss: Who&#39; possess the manuscript of the dead writer? Moreover, &#39;possession&#39; is also suitable for sexual relationships. At that time I am studying the letter from Browning and his wife. Thinking of two pairs of lovers, one pair is modern, and the other is an ancient -Victorian person, let them reflect &#39;possession&#39; in these senses. &lt;/ P>; &lt;p>; The publication of &quot;Posted&quot; (full title &quot;possessive: a Roman history&quot;) indicates that a &quot;new Bayeut&quot; surfaces, she has a narrative talent, and the novels have a humorous irony of the academic circle. And like a suspense detective story, it is still a moving (as it is shown in its deputy title) romantic legend. &quot;I originally planned to write an experimental novel, about literary theory and ambitious biographical text ... The one who changed all of this was my reading experience of Aiko&#39;s&quot; Rose&#39;s Name &quot;and its ironic medieval detective story ... The secret I discovered in it is: a wonderful story, you can put in any content you need to put in. &quot;&lt;/P>; &lt;p>; In the text of&quot; Occupy &quot;, Bayeter boldly put it into her own Imitate the poetry created by Victorian poetry. &quot;This novel needs real poems in form, but I don&#39;t write poems. At that time, my editor said: Don&#39;t just kidding, you write it yourself! So, I went home to write the Victorian poetry related to the spider ... I have always been fascinated by the poems of Ding Nisheng and Browning. I studied as a child as a child because my mother was an expert in Browning. Their rhythm sang in my mind. In my novels, those Victorian poetry suddenly suddenly suddenly suddenly made this suddenly suddenly. Come out. &quot;&lt;/P>; &lt;p>; When Bayeut completed the possession, publishers on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean were deeply troubled, and almost all were skeptical. &quot;They begged me to delete those poems and write about Victorian era. The only American publishers who bravely accepted it did not forget to remind me: &#39;You are these burdens, destroying all the suspenseful tastes.&#39; Early in the morning, I cried, I cried, I cried, and I cried. I cried. I cried. I cried. . Later, this novel won the Booker Award, which surprised everyone (including me). It became a best -selling book, and some people used the poets I imagined to write the dissertation.多种语言。我欠艾柯很大的人情。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/23/lVwV5oiE7YyAk81DJaL91Dxb3tBmm8PecdppoaHu. jpg &quot;border =&quot; 0 &quot;width =&quot; 960 &quot;height =&quot; 960 &quot;data-src =&quot; // Images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/23/Lvwv55yyak81djal91dxb3tbmm8pe CDPPOAHU.JPG &quot;Data-Key = &quot;259392&quot;>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>; Matisse story &lt;span style = &quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>; &lt;strong>; Static life &lt;/strong>; &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; Byeut said in an exclusive interview with the New York Times: &quot;I am not a scholar who wrote a novel by chance.

Fierce, from competing for the surname &quot;Zhou&quot; to now &quot;fighting&quot; to compete for the market. Is such low-quality competition really conducive to the long-term development of domestic jewelry companies? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/23/wGz3dhhd4CDXkvhPLQvgDrkH4GxKYoxNfI5u1tMC.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/23/wGz3dhhd4CDXkvhPLQvgDrkH4GxKYoxNfI5u1tMC.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;259328&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; >;&lt;strong>;Robbing for the surname &quot;Zhou&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Many consumers who don’t know much about gold brands have inevitably encountered such confusion: Why do so many gold companies have the surname &quot;Zhou&quot;? For example, Chow Tai Fook, Chow Sang Sang, Chow Tai Sang, Saturday Fook, Chow Jin Sang, Chow Pak Fook, Chow Fu Sang... In fact, the founders of many of them are not named &quot;Chow&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Chow Tai Fook is a well-known old brand. As early as 1929, Chow Tai Fook&#39;s founder Zhou Zhiyuan founded the first &quot;Chow Tai Fook Gold Store&quot; on Hongde Road, Guangzhou, mainly selling traditional gold jewelry. In the 1930s, due to the current situation, Zhou Zhiyuan moved Chow Tai Fook Bank from Guangzhou to Macau, and later opened a branch in Hong Kong. In 2011, Chow Tai Fook was listed in Hong Kong. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Chow Sang Sang is also an old brand, and the founder is also named Zhou. In 1934, Shunde native Zhou Fangpu founded Jinhang in Guangzhou. From the 1930s to the 1940s, Chow Sang Sang had opened many branches in Hong Kong and Macao. Chow Sang Sang was listed in 1973. It was the first listed gold and jewelry company in Hong Kong. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Chow Tai Sang was established much later than Chow Tai Fook and Chow Sang Sang. It opened its first counter in Wangfujing Department Store in Beijing in 1999 and was listed on the Shenzhen Main Board in 2017. The founder of Zhou Dasheng, Zhou Zongwen, is from Fuqing, Fujian Province, but his surname is indeed &quot;Zhou&quot;, so there is nothing wrong with naming the gold bank Zhou Dasheng. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Saturday Fu&#39;s surname is &quot;Zhou&quot;, which has caused a lot of controversy. In 2004, Li Weipeng and Chen Chuangjin jointly invested in the establishment of Saturday Fortune. In 2005, Chen Chuangjin transferred 50% of the equity held by Li Weipeng to Li Weizhu, Li Weipeng&#39;s brother. In other words, the founder and current head of Saturday Fortune is named &quot;Li&quot;. The name of Luk Fook will also cause consumers to confuse it with &quot;Luk Fook Jewelry&quot;. Lukfook Jewelry was established in Hong Kong in 1991 and listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in 1997. It is more senior than Lukfook. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Some jewelry brands named &quot;Zhou&quot; that appeared after 2000 did not have founders named Zhou. For example, the founders of Zhou Jinsheng are surnamed Li, the founders of Zhou Baifu are surnamed Ye, and the founders of Zhou Fusheng are surnamed Zheng... The founders of these brands must be well aware of whether there is a motive for &quot;taking advantage of&quot; the brand. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The rush to surname &quot;Zhou&quot; reflects a dilemma of domestic jewelry brands: There is still a lack of domestic jewelry brands that are truly out of the circle, and consumers fail to understand some of the problems. Some brands generate real loyalty. Gold banks look similar, and consumers don’t care that much. This gives those who “fake” the brand an opportunity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/23/3q8lLZ1kdijbLfTD5NOyZfbGST9i21Ndx4qJPKzJ.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/23/3q8lLZ1kdijbLfTD5NOyZfbGST9i21Ndx4qJPKzJ.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;259329&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; >;&lt;strong>;Seize for the sinking market&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Not only are they competing for the surname &quot;Zhou&quot;, China&#39;s major gold banks are also competing for the market. This time, the employees of Zhou Taisheng and Lao Fengxiang fought over soliciting business, which is a microcosm of the current situation of jewelry brands competing for the sinking market. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Whether it is Lao Fengxiang, China Gold, or a group of gold banks named &quot;Zhou&quot;, they have opened stores in the sinking market. Some netizens posted that their hometown is a small county, but “seven or eight gold stores have opened on one street.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Chow Tai Fook&#39;s first quarter financial report of this year shows that in the first quarter, Chow Tai Fook opened 248 new retail points in the mainland. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Chow Tai Sang&#39;s financial report shows that as of the first quarter of 2023, the number of Chow Tai Sang&#39;s terminal stores has increased by a net of 133 stores compared with the end of the same period last year, and by a net increase of 21 stores from the beginning of the year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;China Gold&#39;s 2023 first quarter financial report shows that China Gold added 21 direct-operated stores and 325 franchise stores in the first quarter; Chow Sang Sang also predicted in the financial report , the group will have a net increase of approximately 100 branches in 2023. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Most of these branches are in third- and fourth-tier cities. For example, in 2022, more than half of Chow Tai Fook&#39;s new stores will be located in sinking markets, and the proportion of retail value in third-tier, fourth-tier and other cities has reached one-third. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The reason why we target the sinking market is that on the one hand, the gold and jewelry market in first- and second-tier cities has gradually become saturated, and there is no shortage of gold banks and gold stores. Expand market share and begin to extend to lower-tier markets. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On the other hand, in addition to investment and self-wear, a very critical part of the consumer demand for jewelry is wedding demand. In small counties, there are customary requirements for &quot;three golds&quot; (gold necklaces, gold rings, gold earrings) or &quot;hardwares&quot; (gold bracelets and gold headdresses are added to the &quot;three golds&quot;) for weddings. Gold consumption of 10,000 yuan is &quot;standard&quot; in many places. This is a big cake. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;However, the sinking of gold brands has also brought new problems. The first thing to bear the brunt is brand management. Many new stores are franchise stores of the brand. The management level of the franchisees varies. Once a problem occurs, it becomes a brand problem and has an impact on the brand image. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;What is even more embarrassing is that for consumers in the sinking market, whether you are the senior Lao Fengxiang, Chow Tai Fook, the much younger Chow Tai Seng, or the local There is no fundamental difference between some &quot;no-name&quot; gold banks. Consumers &quot;buy whichever one is cheaper&quot;. Anyway, they are all gold, so whoever you buy is not buying. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Therefore, the &quot;business war&quot; of gold banks in the sinking market sometimes involves simply and crudely grabbing customers, which may lead to conflicts. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Need to work hard on craftsmanship and brand management&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;No matter Whether they are competing for the surname &quot;Zhou&quot; or the outrageous conflicts caused by low-quality competition, they have jointly exposed the common dilemma of domestic gold brands: the brand premium is not high, consumers&#39; brand loyalty is not high, and competition is still in the &quot;reckless&quot; stage. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Precisely because the brand premium is not high, the profit margins of domestic gold brands are not high. No matter how the gold price outside rises, buying gold at a gold bank only adds a labor fee to the gold price. According to industry analysis, the retail gross profit margin of gold is 10%-20%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;As for profit margins, they are even lower. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;For example, Lao Fengxiang&#39;s first quarter financial report for 2023 shows that during the reporting period, the company achieved total operating income of 24.558 billion yuan, net profit attributable to the parent company of 716 million yuan, and a profit margin of 2.9%; China Gold’s operating income in the first quarter of 2023 was 16.139 billion yuan, net profit attributable to the parent company was 300 million yuan, and the profit margin was 1.86%...&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In comparison , some foreign luxury jewelry brands, such as Tiffany, Bulgari, and Van Cleef &amp; Arpels, have enviable retail gross profit margins, which can reach 50%-60%. The materials used are obviously ordinary materials that are cheaper than gold, but the price is eye-popping, and consumers still flock to it. Labeling consumers as &quot;foolish people with too much money&quot; is just the self-comfort of those who are lagging behind. Domestic gold brands need to face the gap head-on. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Where do these luxury brands “win”? On the one hand, luxury brand craftsmanship and innovation have elements of originality and originality. For example, Van Cleef &amp; Arpels&#39; &quot;Four-Leaf Clover&quot; series has become a hit because of its classics. Domestic gold brands have also been exploring craftsmanship in recent years. For example, Chow Tai Fook&#39;s &quot;ancient gold&quot; is very popular among young consumers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Unfortunately, following the trend in China is still too serious. Nowadays, almost every mainstream gold brand has an ancient gold series, and the distinction between brands is even worse. Disappeared. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The other is the continuous cultivation of brand image. Nowadays, many gold brands co-brand with brands that young people like, such as Harry Potter and Zootopia. This is of course one way, but the co-branding itself relies more on the power of other brands and cannot be converted into the value of its own brand. . Consumers will buy co-branded models, but they will not become loyal users of gold brands. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In the final analysis, to enhance brand power, we must avoid short-sightedness, avoid eagerness for quick success, avoid following the trend, be calm, sit back, and work hard on craftsmanship. Enhance the artistry and sense of nobility of the brand, making it difficult for other brands to copy it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Otherwise, if you blindly follow the trend, blindly expand the market and open franchises, it may seem that you have a large market share, but in fact, you will still earn money through hard work. fee. In the end, no matter how fierce the &quot;fight&quot; is, consumers will still buy the cheaper one - and your &quot;fight&quot; is in vain. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;获取更多RSS：&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.run&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.run&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 23 Nov 2023 14:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[儿童医院人满为患，国家卫健委回应]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261135]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-23 13:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;In view of the recent increase in the number of outpatient and emergency visits in hospitals and the increase in the number of children infected with respiratory diseases in some places, the National Health Commission In an exclusive interview with Xinhua News Agency on November 23, the relevant responsible comrades of the Health Committee answered some questions that the public, especially families of children, are concerned about. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Question:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Recently, many local children’s hospitals have been overcrowded, and the National Health Commission has taken measures What measures are in place to provide relief? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Answer:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Recently, we have continued to pay attention to the diagnosis and treatment of vulnerable groups in children during the period of high incidence of infectious diseases, and guided all localities to strengthen overall planning and implement hierarchical diagnosis and treatment. system. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Question:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Some community hospitals have recently opened examinations for children services, but some parents are worried that community hospitals have insufficient diagnostic and treatment capabilities and may delay their children’s condition.

After looking at the collection of the library, I couldn’t help but wonder, just for the Chinese local chronicles, which library in China has so many original local chronicles from the early Qing Dynasty, where you can read them by hand, take photos for free, and each set of rare books has been specially protected. Protected and carefully collected, this is just the tip of the iceberg of Harvard&#39;s many libraries. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Professor Zhao Kui said that some of Harvard University’s chronicles were purchased by Yenching University when it was running a school in China in the late Qing Dynasty and the Republic of China, some were purchased from Japanese collectors after Japan’s defeat, and many were purchased by Chinese collectors. The income is directly donated by the family, which is the accumulated income of hundreds of years and generations of research. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Regardless of the amount of information, Harvard University’s openness is worth promoting in China. Foreigners who intend to visit the Harvard University Library can enter the library with valid documents after applying for a visit. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In China&#39;s relevant laws and policies, public libraries must be open to the public free of charge. However, school libraries do not have this obligation. In 2017, the second draft of the Public Library Law was reviewed, and Article 47 stipulated: “The state encourages school libraries, libraries of scientific research institutions, and other types of libraries to be open to the public.” Article 48 of the Public Library Law that was finally implemented stipulates: &quot;The state supports school libraries, scientific research institution libraries and other types of libraries to be open to the public.&quot; From encouragement to support, opening school libraries to the public On the issue of openness, the attitude has become weaker. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some people believe that libraries in universities and scientific research institutions serve specific teachers and students, and students also pay fees to go to university. Therefore, libraries in universities and scientific research institutions should put the interests of teachers and students first. In the first place, there is no obligation to the public. From the perspective of resources and capabilities, school libraries have limited space. Now many university libraries are overcrowded and it is difficult to find a library. University libraries are unable to assume the responsibility of opening to the outside world. Opening up to the outside world will worsen the experience of teachers and students in schools. After it is opened to the outside world, even if there is access through ID cards, citizen cards, etc., it cannot be strictly managed like subway security inspections. There are great dangers and hidden dangers, which is not conducive to protecting students. In addition, there will be management issues, such as the problem of non-return after lending. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Actually, these reasons are not valid. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First of all, although students pay tuition fees, the running costs of the university cannot be covered by tuition fees. China&#39;s universities and scientific research institutions are all supported by state funding, including libraries, and state funding comes from taxes paid by each citizen. University libraries are also public libraries to some extent. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The public&#39;s demand for the library is mainly for borrowing, which will not put too much pressure on the venue. In terms of management, the credit system is now very developed and can fully undertake the management of university libraries opening to the outside world. In addition to ID cards, citizen cards, and financial credit systems, social credit systems such as Zhima Fen are now very efficient. Not only can you borrow power banks and shared bicycles without a deposit, you can even rent a car without a deposit. These values ​​are more expensive than books. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for security issues, borrowing itself is a screening demand. Those who have this demand are people with some education. Even if it is open, it will not be like a teahouse or bar, and the demand will not skyrocket and the pressure will not be Not big. Of course, there are always more risks when there are more people, but this risk is no higher than college students taking the subway or walking on the street, so the so-called safety issues are not valid. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, there is another very important reason why universities and research institutions do not open their libraries, that is, they can monopolize scarce information and academic resources, thereby gaining advantages in publishing papers and producing results. But obviously, academic libraries supported by public finance should not become exclusive academic resources. Someone said on Weibo that he went to the National Library and wanted to read the only copy of &quot;The Book of Fishing&quot; from the Ming Dynasty. He only saw it after asking for help. He was not allowed to take pictures. It took him three days to enter it on the computer and spent more than 500 yuan on the remaining part. Copying, and you also need to sign a &quot;no publication&quot; guarantee before you can read it. The original copies of the Ming Dynasty have long lost their copyright. The library should be responsible for disseminating knowledge, but it regards this as an exclusive resource. This phenomenon is more serious in universities and research institutions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The libraries of universities and research institutions are more professional than public libraries and have more comprehensive subject materials. If they are only used by one family, it will cause waste. If they are open to the public, they can exert greater value and make more people use it. Many people benefit, and it is also conducive to academic competition and innovation. On the other hand, university libraries are independent, which will lead to duplication of construction and is not conducive to the efficient use of resources. Opening up university libraries and sharing resources is conducive to the differentiation of university libraries into professional directions, which is also a good thing for universities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Good Will Hunting&quot;, which was nominated for Best Picture at the 70th Academy Awards together with &quot;Titanic&quot;, tells the story of the growth of a talented boy. In the film, a Harvard college student laughs at the male protagonist, and the male protagonist counterattacks: &quot;The education you spent fifteen thousand dollars on, I can get in a public library for only one and a half dollars.&quot; Open libraries are conducive to education. Fairness and fair opportunities allow more people who have not entered universities or scientific research institutions to easily obtain academic materials and promote the development of China&#39;s science, technology, and cultural knowledge. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In March 2017, the Ministry of Education and the General Administration of Sports jointly issued the &quot;Implementation Opinions on Promoting the Opening of School Sports Venues to the Society&quot;, which aims to effectively alleviate the growing sports and fitness needs of young people and the general public. The contradiction between sports venues and insufficient supply of resources promotes the prosperity and development of national fitness. Objectively speaking, the operation of sports venues is a zero-sum game with little flexibility and an either-or for users. But the library is different. If it is just for borrowing, opening it to the public will have little impact on students and researchers. Therefore, since university stadiums can &quot;promote opening to the public&quot;, then there is no reason for university libraries to be closed and refused to be open to the public. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The library is a public service with strong externalities. It can popularize knowledge, help innovation, and drive the country&#39;s technological and economic progress and social development. The more borrowings there are, the stronger the role of the library. It is a great thing for the country and individuals for libraries to operate at a higher intensity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Therefore, the state should promote, encourage and even require libraries in universities and research institutions to be open to the public. Nowadays, libraries have a lot of electronic materials, which are open to the public. They do not occupy library space and do not put a lot of pressure on the network. Electronic materials in colleges and universities are open to the public, and this can be done immediately. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 23 Nov 2023 12:25:04 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
