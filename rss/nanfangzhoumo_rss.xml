Chidu Company founder Sun Haoyu recently posted on social media that the procedural issues in his criminal private prosecution case against Xiao Huijun for defamation have been resolved and will be heard soon. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the end of 2020, the well-known cross-dressing blogger &quot;Sien Xiaohuijun&quot; publicly accused her former boss Sun Haoyu of sexually harassing her online. Fortunately, Sun Haoyu later obtained evidence to prove that the so-called sexual harassment was just a rumor created by Xiao Huijun in order to terminate the contract with the company at a low cost. Including Xiao Huijun and several other contract anchors under Chidu premeditated and planned this rumor and slander incident in a group. After obtaining the evidence, Sun Haoyu filed a civil lawsuit against Xiao Huijun and others, which was supported by the court. The court clearly stated in the civil judgment that the evidence proved that the alleged sexual harassment was fiction, and ordered Xiao Huijun and others to apologize and compensate for losses to Chidu Company and Sun Haoyu. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Afterwards, Sun Haoyu filed a criminal private prosecution with the court, requesting that Xiao Huijun be held criminally responsible for spreading rumors and defamation. Initially, the court in Xiao Huijun&#39;s place of residence believed that it had no jurisdiction and ruled to dismiss Sun Haoyu&#39;s lawsuit. The higher court ruling published by Sun Haoyu this time determined that the court at Xiao Huijun&#39;s place of residence had jurisdiction and ordered the court to open the case and accept it. At this point, there is no obstacle to filing a criminal case against Xiao Huijun for defamation, and the next step will be to enter the formal trial process. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From being rumored to be sexually assaulted, to winning the civil lawsuit and the court confirming that &quot;Xiao Huijun&quot; spread the rumor, to finally filing a criminal private prosecution case, the journey has been difficult. In view of the frequent occurrence of similar rumors on the Internet, many netizens hope that Xiao Huijun&#39;s case will deter those who try to follow suit. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In recent years, there have been constant incidents of accusing others of sexual harassment or even sexual assault through online essays. However, many of them are difficult to distinguish between true and false, and some have been deemed by judicial authorities as lacking evidence or even being slanderous. For example, a female employee of a well-known large factory alleged that she was raped by a male leader, but police investigation showed that there was no rape. Recently, another host was also accused of rape, and police investigations revealed that the woman suffered from schizophrenia and experienced hallucinations and delusions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For these online essays alleging sexual assault, many netizens often choose to believe the parties involved for the first time. The reason is often that &quot;women will not use their innocence to slander others.&quot; However, many facts prove that in the face of interests, nothing is impossible. For example, Xiao Huijun did not hesitate to sacrifice her &quot;innocence&quot; in order to terminate the contract with Chidu Company at a low cost. There are also some people whose motives for slander are difficult for ordinary people to understand, and they may simply have mental problems. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After Xiao Huijun accused Sun Haoyu of sexual harassment, many netizens believed it to be true. Sun Haoyu and Chidu Company were bullied online and threatened offline. The company&#39;s door and front desk were smashed many times, and Sun Haoyu was always crowded when he went out. Followed by taking pictures and cursing. An MCN organization that was originally at the top of the industry has almost come to a standstill and is now unknown in the industry. A well-known host was at the peak of his career, but after being accused of sexual harassment, he was put into hiding, and his career and reputation were ruined. Although they won the lawsuit, their careers struggled to recover. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is extremely difficult for these men who have been falsely accused to defend their reputations. In civil litigation, it is difficult to obtain evidence recognized by the court. Sun Haoyu was lucky. Someone in Xiao Huijun&#39;s &quot;Blood Battle Chidu&quot; small group found his way back and provided the chat records Sun Haoyu needed. Zhang Heng, another well-known online article author who was falsely accused of raping an underage female fan more than ten years ago, has been unable to obtain the identity of the false accuser through legal channels, let alone prosecute. The accuser just wanted to make a famous person look bad, but he &quot;hidden his fame and achievements&quot; and didn&#39;t even reveal his true identity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Even if the civil lawsuit is won, the compensation received is very little, and the defendant&#39;s apology is often light and perfunctory, and the amount of communication of the apology is also very different from that of the false accusation. , it is difficult to clarify the facts and restore reputation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To deter rumors and defamation, the rumor makers must pay a greater price, such as criminal liability. However, the criminal law stipulates that spreading rumors and defamation is generally a private prosecution crime, and the victim needs to collect evidence and file a lawsuit. It is even difficult for victims to collect evidence for civil lawsuits, and it is even more difficult for criminal evidence that requires stricter requirements than civil lawsuits. Sun Haoyu was just lucky. He got the evidence and the verdict of winning the civil lawsuit, and he had more confidence to file a criminal private prosecution. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But Sun Haoyu’s good luck is difficult to replicate. In order for those who make false accusations and framers to be punished, the threshold for turning false accusations and frame-ups into public prosecutions needs to be lowered. As long as the victim makes a complaint, the case should be turned into public prosecutions and the police will investigate the case and collect evidence. In this way, we can intensify the crackdown on rumors and slander, protect the interests of victims, and maintain online order. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 28 Sep 2023 20:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[杭州亚运会：赛场内外，同样精彩]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257834]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-28 00:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;As of 17:00 on September 27, 2023, the Chinese delegation It is far ahead in the medal list of the Hangzhou Asian Games, with a total of 124 medals, including 69 gold medals, 39 silver medals, and 16 bronze medals. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;On September 24, 2023, Li Bingjie, who won the women&#39;s 1500-meter freestyle final, displayed her medal.&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/ image/23/09/27/ea98f3aa2a.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;721&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/ 27/ea98f3aa2a.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252480&quot;>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On September 24, 2023, won the women&#39;s 1500-meter freestyle final championship Li Bingjie shows her medal. &lt;/p>;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The 19th Asian Games in Hangzhou will be held from September 23 to October 8, 2023, with a total of 15 competition days.

(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/p>;&lt;p>;In the past &quot;May Day&quot; and the approaching &quot;National Day&quot;, Dr. Sun from the emergency department of Zibo Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital went on two missions during two consecutive long holidays. In order to protect people from all over the country who came to Zi for barbecue, as a member of the city&#39;s medical security team, he stayed on duty at the makeshift barbecue city for several days during the May Day holiday. The constant flow of people made him, an &quot;Old Zibo&quot;, feel unreal. The outside world kept saying that it was going to be cold, but it was always crowded every time he passed by the popular barbecue spot Ba Daji when he went out. Just like that, half a year passed in a blink of an eye. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;After this summer vacation, the streets have indeed regained some calm, but after a marathon, it is full of people again. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;“There will definitely be a wave of traffic during the National Day holiday. This is what it means to hold a marathon at this time.” On September 24, the last weekend before the National Day holiday, this internet celebrity city held its first marathon Marathon. Just after the game ended that day, Dr. Sun gave his prediction for the passenger flow during the National Day holiday. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Because it was held in Zibo, this marathon was nicknamed the &quot;BBQ Marathon&quot; by runners. “As soon as I heard it was the Zibo Marathon, I rushed (to sign up).” After getting off the high-speed train at noon on September 23, Feng Yanhua made an appointment with fellow runners to have a meal. They queued for an hour and a half, and many people in front of the store were carrying Marathon on their backs. The pre-game package looked like a contestant who stopped by for the tooth festival. &quot;Zibo people are very welcoming, and the barbecue is very affordable and delicious.&quot; &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;After several months of &quot;turbulent&quot; drama, Zibo Barbecue has experienced a fierce evolution from explosion to crazy expansion, and then to a brief period of calm. Many interviewees said that after the summer vacation, the market showed obvious signs of calming down. However, whether it will return to its original shape before the epidemic or maintain an average value of warm but not cool, people are still waiting and watching, and it is difficult to tell.

The popularity of Zibo barbecue has dropped after half a year. &quot;It was still very busy in July and August, but after September, it subsided a bit quickly.&quot; Standing at the fork in the traffic flow, whether to advance or retreat, the owner of a barbecue restaurant in Zhangdian District, Zibo City was a little undecided. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Boss Shan’s shop was featured in the documentary &quot;A String of Life&quot;, coupled with the super popularity of &quot;Going to Zi for Barbecue&quot;, the business has been really booming for a long time. &quot;It was a bit broken at the time.

(Visual China/Picture)&lt;/p>;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;As a charity organization with strong fundraising capabilities, the China Children’s Charity Aid Foundation (referred to as the Children’s Charity Society) has recently fallen into disarray. In the midst of the donation turmoil. &lt;/p>;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In September 2023, Ke Mouxiao was accused of using the Children&#39;s Charity Society&#39;s &quot;9958 Children&#39;s Emergency Assistance&quot; project (hereinafter referred to as 9958) to defraud families of seriously ill children out of nearly 1,000 yuan. 10,000 life-saving money was detained by the police. The Children&#39;s Charity Association publicly stated that Ke Mouxiao was not its staff and had only served as a volunteer in the Hebei Langfang Team Cooperation Organization of the 9958 Project. But the controversy has not yet died down. &lt;/p>;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Many parents of children who were deceived said that they participated in the &quot;matching donation&quot; initiated by Ke Mouxiao and transferred the funds to Ke Mouxiao.

Because this kind of &quot;matching donation&quot; is a normal operation mode in the charity sector, and families of seriously ill children are accustomed to it, there is no doubt about the authenticity of the project initiated by Ke Mouxiao. (For details, please see Southern Weekly’s report &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.infzm.com/contents/256685?source=131&quot;>;China Children’s Charity Association volunteers are involved in nearly 10 million yuan in aid, and families with serious illness are in trouble again.

According to relevant laws and policies, it is illegal for charitable organizations to induce parents of children with self-raised funds to participate in matching donations or donate for their own use. &lt;/p>;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Does the Children&#39;s Charity Association know about such &quot;matching donations&quot;? Southern Weekend reporters discovered that deficiencies in the management and operation of charitable organizations provide a breeding ground for the alienation of matching donations. The more money is raised, the more matching donations are made - with the same goal, the people who need the money most take their money out of their pockets, boosting the charity&#39;s fundraising figures. &lt;/p>;&lt;h4>;“Who dares to do it if you can’t get the money back?”&lt;/h4>;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;It’s the 99 Charity Day in September every year.

September 9, 2015 is China’s first Internet Charity Day. In order to arouse the enthusiasm of the whole people to participate in public welfare, the organizers introduced a popular foreign method-matching donations. &lt;/p>;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Matching donation is a matching donation. After a donor donates a sum of money to a charity organization, another donor (usually a company) will randomly or according to Donate a certain percentage of money to the same charity organization. The original intention of the matching donation model is to encourage the public to participate in donations. According to its original intention, the donation amount including corporate matching should not be used for the donor himself. &lt;/p>;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The Charity Law also clearly stipulates that when a donor and a charitable organization agree on the purpose and beneficiaries of donated property, the donor&#39;s interested parties shall not be designated as beneficiaries. &lt;/p>;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;But Li Shan has never heard of the above regulations. On the eve of the 99 Charity Day in 2023, Li Shan opened a &quot;Donate Together&quot; charity matching donation project for each of the three charity matching projects launched by the Children&#39;s Charity Society: &quot;Sunflower Protects Children in the West&quot;, &quot;Girls in Need Guarantee Plan&quot; and &quot;Aiding Children in Need to Dream of Going to School&quot;. ” fundraising link and named it after his daughter, who has leukemia. &lt;/p>;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Donate Together&quot; is a charity game launched by Tencent Charity Platform.

The champion at that time later became a video game programmer. With the launch of the WCG (World Electronic Sports Competition) after the millennium, Esports, or &quot;electronic sports&quot;, began to become an international event. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Xiaodong, dean and doctoral supervisor of the School of Leisure Sports and Management of Guangzhou Institute of Physical Education, told Southern Weekend reporters that in primitive society, people had invented sports activities such as running and swimming; in agricultural society, people had horse riding, bows and arrows, etc. Activities; In industrial society, people began to ride bicycles, race cars, etc.; &quot;The digital age will definitely use numbers as tools and new sports will appear.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On February 16, 2023, at the &quot;Asian Games TALK Guangzhou Station&quot; event held at the Guangzhou Library, Xu Deqing, director of the Propaganda Department of the Hangzhou Asian Organizing Committee and deputy director of the Propaganda Department of the Hangzhou Municipal Party Committee, responded to Southern Weekend Reporter’s question about e-sports. Xu Deqing believes that e-sports is a culture of youth, teamwork and innovation. &quot;E-sports is different from games. E-sports is defined as a contest of intelligence, just like chess and Go. It is a contest of intelligence.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among the forty competition events at the Hangzhou Asian Games, e-sports are classified as &quot;intellectual events&quot; along with bridge, chess, go and xiangqi. The &quot;World Brain Games Federation&quot; once defined &quot;brain games&quot; as &quot;a sport or game that is related to the mental abilities of the participants rather than their physical advantages.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Qi Xin, associate professor and master’s tutor at the Department of Physical Education and Research of Peking University, recalled a scene from 20 years ago. In 2003, the State Sports General Administration listed &quot;e-sports&quot; as the 99th official sports event in my country. At that time, e-sports was still a new thing, and she and her students discussed &quot;whether e-sports is a sport or not&quot; in class. Opponents accounted for the vast majority. In fact, it was not just e-sports, but also chess sports. These sports lacked physical movement and were not well accepted as &quot;sports&quot; at the time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past ten years, Qi Xin has clearly felt that the outside world&#39;s perception of sports and e-sports has changed significantly. Peking University has a student-organized e-sports association, and more and more students are participating. According to Qi Xin&#39;s observation, the personal abilities of these students have been developed, such as thinking ability, reaction ability, overall view, willpower and team spirit. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A few years ago, she met a former professional e-sports player at an event. She listened to the player talk about competitions and training, and her impression of e-sports gradually changed. &quot;In addition to talent, you also need to undergo hard training the day after tomorrow.&quot; Qi Xin said that when the players compete, they are the same as traditional sports athletes. There is nothing else in front of them, only the competition, even if they encounter physical and mental problems. In the difficult situation, he will try his best to win at that moment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“People are gradually realizing that competitiveness is also the core content of e-sports.” Qi Xin listed to Southern Weekend reporters, “In a game, what will be improved physically and mentally, and what will be negative? Appear? How to stimulate team enthusiasm and creativity in e-sports competitions, and cultivate the sports spirit of not admitting defeat, not being discouraged, and fighting tenaciously? These are important research topics.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Qi Xin believes that if e-sports Athletes can gain a certain degree of social visibility and recognition like well-known athletes in other sports fields, and they can even participate in college teaching in the future. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Different from traditional domestic sports, e-sports events have always been promoted from the bottom up by game manufacturers, e-sports clubs, etc.: e-sports games appear, clubs enter, live broadcast platforms rise, and events gradually improve. Finally entered the Asian Games. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When the news of e-sports entering Asia came, Wang Guoji felt it was &quot;a bit sudden, but not unexpected.&quot; Wang Guoji is the chairman of the e-sports working committee of the China Cultural Management Association. He explained that although e-sports developed from online games, it is quite different from games: &quot;Online games and e-sports, hobbies and professionalism must be clearly understood. Be aware of it and make a clear distinction. It does not mean that today, when Hangzhou holds the Asian Games and 7 e-sports events have become official competition events, online games are fully endorsed.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;We are doing A serious matter&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Industry insiders believe that the entry of e-sports into Asia will bring the e-sports industry into a more standardized direction. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Qi Xin told Southern Weekend reporters that the difference between &quot;playing e-sports&quot; and &quot;playing games&quot; lies in &quot;sports rules.&quot; E-sports needs to abide by strict sports regulations, which Qi Xin calls &quot;edges and boundaries&quot; to ensure order and control of e-sports. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sun Jing, a staff member involved in the Asian Games e-sports project, said that e-sports projects are gradually becoming &quot;serious&quot;, and the competition format and rules are closer to traditional and formal sports projects. &quot;This is a problem for many manufacturers.&quot; It is a big challenge for the competition team.” In order to adapt to the rules of the Asian Games, some e-sports schedules have been changed. For example, the original five games that decided victory were reduced to three. At least three months in advance, e-sports players must start closed training and implement a diet plan to ensure that they pass doping tests. And these are still unimaginable in the league. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The rules are indeed more detailed. Sun Jing said that in 2006, the e-sports management rules totaled about 5,000 words; now, the latest version of the rules has about 120,000 words. &quot;The process of the game, various foul situations, and the details of each event are all broken down in detail,&quot; he told Southern Weekend reporters. &quot;It is still far from the rules of football and basketball, but it is already comparable to the rules of some traditional events. It&#39;s relatively close.&quot; For example, when confirming the start of the game, &quot;the rules state that within 5 minutes of the start of the game, if an irreparable bug is triggered, the game must be replayed.&quot; The industry discussed this for a long time before determining which moment should be counted. &quot;Game start&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Compared with the relaxed age requirements for athletes in some traditional sports, such as the current Asian Games, where 13-year-old Cui Chenxi won the women&#39;s skateboarding street finals, the industry has stricter age requirements for e-sports athletes. high. For example, the Zhejiang Provincial E-Sports Association requires that to meet the requirements for registered e-Sports athletes, you must be over 18 years old, complete nine years of compulsory education, and obtain a full-time junior high school diploma or above. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporters visited the Hangzhou LGD E-sports Club. Club manager Marseille said that they would not consider minors to become players. The professional age of e-sports players is between 18 and 25 years old, which means that the opportunity to become a professional player is fleeting. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Club professional testing often dissuades many young people with e-sports ideas. This test tests people&#39;s reaction, instant memory, hand-eye-brain coordination and other abilities through computer and equipment. After multiple rounds of tests, only six people passed all the tests, but after entering the youth training team, they still faced many difficulties. The elimination rate from the youth training to the second team is 67%, and the elimination rate from the second team to the first team is 50%. Some youth training players will leave the club and find another place if they cannot prove that they can participate in higher-level competitions within half a year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Pan Jie, CEO of LGD E-Sports Club, said that there is a very detailed evaluation system for talent selection, which not only examines online practical performance, but also offline interviews to evaluate their realistic psychological conditions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sun Jing told Southern Weekend reporters that some e-sports events are exactly the same as traditional sports. For example, in FPS (first-person shooter) games, he noticed that players need to complete a certain amount of traditional physical exercise to train muscle reaction speed, and the concept of &quot;warm-up&quot; is also introduced. Some high-intensity games are played from morning to night. Without this foundation, it is easy to suffer from physical exhaustion. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ying Shunjie is the deputy director of the Shanghai E-sports Education and Training Working Committee and has been engaged in e-sports education for many years. He told Southern Weekend reporters that the e-sports industry has always paid attention to the traditional sports industry, including the training system and management, and is learning from traditional sports. &quot;It pays attention to players&#39; mental health, injury management, daily work and rest, physical functions, etc., these are traditional Something that esports doesn’t have.” He mentioned that the past &quot;Internet cafe-style&quot; model was obviously unhealthy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Pan Jie said that the great development of e-sports competitions is due to learning from the game rules, transfer rules, salary caps, etc. of mature sports leagues such as the NBA. However, in the process of learning, traditional sports rules are always &quot;acclimated&quot;, especially how to adapt the rules that serve offline to online. &quot;At the beginning, all the rules were purely competitive, and later they included some commercial terms.&quot; It has also gradually been incorporated into the club system.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Why do we have so many people organizing, media operation center, athlete village, media village, venue competition team, and referee team? Because we are doing a serious thing.&quot; Sun Jing said . &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;High-intensity physical exercise, the future of e-sports? &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;On September 6, 2023, the International Olympic Committee announced the establishment of the International Olympic Committee E-sports Committee. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“We believe that virtual sports can help promote the core values ​​of the Olympic Movement such as excellence, friendship and respect,” said IOC President Bach. “They can inspire young people around the world to participate in sports activities and have active health. lifestyle.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is worth mentioning that Bach divided e-sports into three categories: The first category is virtual reality sports, in which there are physical movements and the participants&#39; bodies are faced with (high-intensity) Sports and challenges; the second category involves esports competitions conducted under the rules of international sports federations; and the third category is broader esports. The International Olympic Committee’s priority is Category 1 admission. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Guangzhou Institute of Physical Education is the first public undergraduate university in China to offer e-sports majors. Wang Xiaodong believes that e-sports is divided into competitions with physical sports and competitions without physical sports, and virtual sports refers to the former. He used simulated racing as an example. The intensity of exercise in a racing simulator is not much different from that in actual racing. They once held a simulation racing competition, and all the children participating in the competition were &quot;full of energy.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Xiaodong advocates what Bach calls virtual sports. He told Southern Weekend reporters that the school’s e-sports courses must first learn physical education, and the students are also traditional sports students. He also mentioned the difficulty of these projects. At present, the market competition acceptance of virtual sports is not too high, and the youth foundation is relatively weak. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Compared with virtual sports, non-physical e-sports events such as &quot;FIFA Online 4&quot;, &quot;Glory of Kings&quot; and &quot;League of Legends&quot; obviously have higher acceptance in the market. The e-sports events at the Hangzhou Asian Games actually cover two directions, including virtual sports events like the former and popular e-sports events like the latter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporters learned that the current investment of domestic clubs is still in the latter, rather than traditional virtual sports projects. Pan Jie analyzed that a club’s investment project needs to consider the user base, market conditions, league system, event viewing, etc. At present, the development of virtual sports is relatively limited. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Guoji participated in the Olympic Esports Week held in Singapore in June 2023, and he had a deep feeling. Among the competitions held in Singapore, 9 are virtual sports, such as shooting, taekwondo, dance games, etc. that require physical participation. &quot;With the continuous advancement of electronic equipment, under the current human environment, e-sports, especially virtual sports, has become a new form of sports. This is very positive and healthy, and it also has broad development prospects in the future.&quot; Wang Guoji believes , when humans enter the digital age, some new forms of sports will be born, and they may far exceed traditional forms of sports. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For a long time, people have believed that there are some problems in non-physical sports competitions. For example, sitting for a long time without exercise is not in line with a healthy spirit. At the same time, the hidden dangers of addiction have also aggravated the concerns of the outside world. Unlike traditional sports, e-sports are likely to be influenced by game copyright owners, which also increases people&#39;s doubts about fairness. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Qi Xin told Southern Weekend reporters that if e-sports is just a leisure and entertainment activity based on the original games in the future, the direction will be very limited: &quot;If in the future our e-sports is just an intellectual activity I think the challenge may become narrower and narrower. The future direction of e-sports is to develop towards sports, not just games.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The end of the industry is culture&lt;/h4>; &lt;p >;In eighteen years of relevant industry experience, Pan Jie believes that the development of the e-sports industry has always been a &quot;step-by-step&quot; process. Its prosperity is inseparable from the huge user base, especially the enthusiasm of young people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Different from the past “rectification of names”, after the professionalization of e-sports, “persuading people to quit” has become an important matter. &quot;Many children use e-sports as an excuse to play games. In fact, they lack talent and do not work hard enough.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2018年，电子竞技入选雅加达亚运会表演赛，中国代表队取得了两金一银的成绩。 2019年4月1日，人力资源和社会保障部、市场监管总局、统计局正式向社会发布了13个新职业信息，其中与电竞行业相关的新职业有电子竞技运营师、电子竞技员两项。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;那时候，应舜洁能感受到2018年雅加达亚运会和一系列国际赛事对电竞行业带来的改变。 2018年上半年招聘从业人员，“大多数过来的人都不知道电竞是干什么的，水平也参差不齐”。应舜洁询问他们关于电竞的认识，得到的答案往往就是与游戏挂钩。下半年开始，应舜洁收到了更多的简历，包括一些传统体育从业者也开始加入。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;应舜洁说，电竞人才缺口巨大，“要求从业者既了解电竞的行业规则，又具备良好的职业技能素养，这在2018年之前是很困难的一件事”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;雅加达亚运会四年后，《2022年中国电子竞技产业报告》显示，2022年中国电竞产业收入1445.03亿元，电竞人口规模约4.88亿，全年举办电竞赛事108项。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;杭州亚组委执行秘书长、杭州市副市长陈卫强在接受媒体专访时坦言，电竞“入亚”更加长远的考量在于产业——通过电竞“入亚”，带动杭州及整个中国电竞产业的发展。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“从游戏的策划、开发到运动员的训练、赛事的组织，还有直转播解说评论，以及大数据的统计，整个电竞产业链非常长，内容非常多。”王国基对南方周末记者说，除了标准化、职业化、国际化，产业化也是非常重要的。受国家人社部委托，电竞委员会制定了电子竞技员国家职业技能标准，编写的相关教材也即将出版。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;潘婕所在的俱乐部曾与法甲足球俱乐部巴黎圣日尔曼合作，她对南方周末记者说，当她来到圣日尔曼主场，发现人们不一定去看足球赛事，但是一定会去俱乐部周边参观，这几乎成为一种城市文化，这给了她很大触动。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;中央电视台体育频道2004年的一档电视栏目《电子竞技世界》中，有一期，栏目组编了一个情景剧。剧中，主持人前往葡萄牙报道欧洲杯，临行前做了一个奇怪的梦：一些FIFA足球和实况足球的游戏玩家，竟然成了欧洲杯16个国家队的主教练……&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这是一个来自二十年前的“预言”。 2023年杭州亚运会，包括《FIFA Online 4》在内的八个电竞项目已经是亚运会正式竞赛项目，9月24日至10月2日,杭州亚运会电竞比赛共将产生7枚金牌。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;（亦枫、陆知安、孙竞为化名。）&lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;会上，国家广播电视总局副局长杨国瑞介绍，电视“套娃”收费问题治理工作，中央高度关心，人民群众高度关注，广电总局深入贯彻以人民为中心的治理理念，下定决心，举全行业之力，将其作为政治工程、民心工程和系统工程予以解决。目前通过有线电视网络传送的有线电视、通过电信运营商专网传送的IPTV、通过互联网传送的互联网电视OTT形成了三大体系，一方面满足了群众多元化需求，另一方面由于多种市场主体不同程度参与电视的播送和收费，造成了“套娃”收费等问题，给人民群众带来困扰。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;前段时间专门成立工作组，针对群众反映强烈的收费包数量多、收费主体多元、收费不透明等问题，调研摸排了全部7家互联网电视集成平台、22家电视机厂商、31个省区市的所有IPTV和有线电视，开展了近万用户的问卷调研，与中央网信办、工信部、市场监管总局、中国消费者协会等部门进行沟通，并听取了产业链参与各方的意见和建议。在摸清底数的基础上，按照总体谋划、分步实施、先易后难、试点先行的思路，分三个阶段全力推进治理工作。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;第一阶段，今年内逐步实现收费包压减40%，提升消费透明度。第二阶段，明年上半年规范电视运营和收费。第三阶段，明年年底健全有线电视、IPTV、OTT三大业务体系长效管理机制，确保电视“套娃”收费问题“治得住、不反弹”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;最近已经开始了第一阶段的治理工作，确定了覆盖三大体系的北京歌华有线、山东省网、上海移动、广东电信、吉林联通以及小米电视和海信电视共7家试点单位。指导推动相关企业制定压减、合并收费包，增加订购管理页面，优化免费专区具体实施方案，其中歌华有线已经将14个收费包压减到5个，广东电信IPTV已经将原有10个影视类收费包压减为1个，新出厂的小米电视、海信电视不再预装APK。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;预计到今年10月底，试点单位收费包将压减40%以上，11—12月份在全国范围内开展集中整治，整体压减收费包40%，电视“套娃”收费现象得到显著改观。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 28 Sep 2023 16:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[凤凰传奇粉丝逆龄化？00后为何迷上父母辈偶像]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257629]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-28 15:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 28 Sep 2023 15:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[大同校园欺凌事件惊骇舆论场：未成年人施暴为何没有下限？ 家长如何应对和预防？丨快评]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257823]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-28 14:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;发生在山西大同大成双语学校的未成年人欺凌事件，震惊全国。大家在震惊之余也在追问：难道某些孩子是天生的恶魔吗？ &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;也许，只有我们深入未成年人的世界，才能正确且深刻理解此类事件的发生学。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;首先，看似弱小无力的孩子为何会欺凌同伴？ &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;其实，欺凌行为与体力关系不大。欺凌本质上是一种心态、手段，目的是为了在施害者与受害者之间构造与建立一种支配—服从的权力关系，欺凌给施害者带来的精神快感是一种支配快感，没有证据证明体力弱小者比体力强大者追求征服与支配的欲望更弱，反而在某些情形下体力弱小者为了使自己显得强大追求征服感、追求支配别人的诱因更足。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;体力弱只是相对而言，总有比TA更弱的。而且，体力弱的人施行欺凌往往有个特征，就是抱团。在有组织的欺凌面前，哪怕被欺凌者体力更强也没有意义。对这些人来说，把体力强的人制服、匍匐于他们的脚下，这种快感是无与伦比的。所以，一群体力上不怎么样的人抱团、有组织欺凌别人时，他们往往还会留下视频，记录自己的所谓成就。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;还需说明的是，未成年人施暴与性别无关。在大同事件引发空前的关切之时，实名认证的刑法学教师蔡雅奇收到了投稿：一位女同学被宿舍的其他女同学欺凌，同样有强迫性的涉性行为，施害者还拍下了视频。故而，在未成年人欺凌乃至性欺凌事件中，不要拿体力强弱与性别说事，这会把对欺凌本质与成因的理解走偏，然后得出错误的预防与应对方法。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;其次，欺凌是追求征服与支配关系的工具，初生牛犊未必不如虎。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;成年人由于“脸面”、道德感或“斗而不破”的需要，欺凌可能往往是有限度的；未成年人由于心智不成熟，没有那么多顾忌，一旦施行欺凌，往往没有下限，足以惊骇成年人，令人感觉怎么有些孩子是天生的恶魔。 “初生牛犊不怕虎”的另一面可没有那么美好。未成年人从欺凌走向性欺凌、性施暴，正是这一内在逻辑的体现。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;任何一个文明社会在某种程度上都多多少少是建立在性禁忌与性羞耻的基础上的。哪怕现代社会打破了一些，松弛了一些，但也难以改变这一事实。以你最引为私密与羞耻的事情，拿到公开场合当众强迫你、凌辱你，就可以从精神上打垮你、施暴者完成了对你的精神规训，实现了对你的精神支配，你就在精神上成为了施暴者的奴隶。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;以上两点，构成了未成年人欺凌乃至性欺凌事件的发生学。在此基础上，我们可以有一些应对与预防之道。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;第一，具体到大同校园事件，大家注意到事件发生在学校宿舍内。这么小的孩子离开父母去住校，是很成问题的。当然，由于学校关并数量减少，孩子的分布会越来越稀疏，导致每个孩子上学的平均距离就越来越远，可能到某个阶段不得不住校以节省每天通勤时间。不过，如果孩子只是上小学，还是就近入学为好，确保孩子每日回家，父母也能够了解孩子在学校的情况与精神状态，有问题可及早发现。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;第二，要明白孩子的世界并不是天真无辜的。人是社会性的动物，在一个有很多人的稳定环境中与两人或多人的固定互动交往中，不可避免会有隐性或显性的等级关系、主导与被主导或影响与被影响关系。这是没法消除的，只要建立在主导者人格魅力与跟随者自愿信从的基础上，那就基本上是无害的。但家长要关注此类关系中有没有涉及强制与施暴，有没有质变为支配—服从关系、施暴—受害关系，如果发现了此类苗头，就一定要及时干预。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;无论自己的孩子是施暴者，还是受害者，都应该干预与制止，这才是一个正派与负责家长的做法。千万不要认为自己的孩子是施暴者，就占了便宜，然后既拒绝干预，又在别的家长发现问题后推诿、不负责任。孩子的作为很可能就是被这样的家长言传身教、潜移默化塑造出来的，是把一个家庭的教育失败扩大为对其他人、对社会的伤害。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;第三，我们的孩子当务之急所需要的性教育是反强迫、反强奸、反性侵、反猥亵教育，在孩子进入幼儿园与小学之前，就要对孩子给与这方面的反复提醒与教育，让孩子树立这样的意识：我的身体是私密的、神圣的，不是随便什么人都可以碰的；有人试图碰自己的身体，应该喝止，并报告老师、父母；我的人格与尊严不容凌辱，我有勇气保卫自己的身体、权利、人格与尊严，敢于对一切欺凌说不。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 28 Sep 2023 14:25:04 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
