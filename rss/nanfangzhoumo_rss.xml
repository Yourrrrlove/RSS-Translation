Neither of us knew when we went there that Joshua Tree’s reputation came from a hallucination caused by an overdose of marijuana. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Joshua Tree is located deep in the desert in the outer suburbs of Los Angeles, so it can be said that this illusion is a type of mirage. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;My ex-boyfriend is from South Korea, a devout Christian, and a scientist by profession. His favorite movie is Nolan&#39;s &quot;Interstellar&quot;, and his fascination with the stars can be said to be a combination of science and faith. On the one hand, he has an endless thirst for knowledge about space and areas unknown to mankind. On the other hand, if we borrow Mr. Qian Mu’s metaphor and regard the known human beings as these little bits of starlight, and the vast and endless darkness as the unknown realm, then the ex-boyfriend’s response to this is: There must be a creator who created All of this, and we humans must spend our entire lives searching for the goodness of everything He created. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although I love reading theology books, I do not believe in any religion. At that time, the starry sky was more of a natural wonder to me. It&#39;s a pity that the two of us put on down jackets and raised our heads like nestlings begging for food in the cold desert night. The starry sky that caught our eyes was not as charming as the one I had seen on the Iowa farm. Sitting on the tractor in the Iowa farm, I was really shocked by the Milky Way above my head: the stars were like the stone bridges on the streams in the Yunnan-Guizhou region, intermittently extending from one bank of the river to the other bank. I tried to Trace each star point with your eyes, imagining that the Cowherd and the Weaver Girl are like this, carefully stepping on the stars to meet in the middle. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;My ex-boyfriend went stargazing for the first time, and the blurry starry sky over Joshua Tree captured his heart. He also became more convinced that it was the hand of God that created all of this. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;——Perhaps, the different attitudes towards Xingguang have already hinted that this relationship is destined to end in vain. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Now that I think of this past incident, it may be because I have been wandering around for these years. Some time ago, a teacher at Washington University in St. Louis asked me to write a letter of recommendation for her. Her resume was full of ups and downs in her academic career. She had held teaching positions in New York State, Pennsylvania, Texas, and Missouri. Now, After ten years of teaching in St. Louis, she finally had a chance to settle down. As a doctoral candidate, I also know that if I am looking for a teaching position, I am destined to face this kind of great migration experience every few years. To be honest, I&#39;m tired of this. The biggest difficulty with living a nomadic life is this: you never make lasting connections. It&#39;s not easy to make one or two close friends, or a lover who you thought would be a lifelong companion, but because of your own or the other person&#39;s migration, the relationship broke up. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Separation, to me, is like letting go of two people and falling into the vast abyss of the universe at the same time without a trace. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is no accident that many poems at home and abroad use starlight to compare separation. I have reached the age where my eyes well up with tears when I read Du Fu&#39;s &quot;If we don&#39;t meet each other in life, we will move like participating in business&quot;. When I was in middle school, the first time I read Xu Zhimo&#39;s &quot;Accidental&quot; I just thought it was romantic. I even thought it was a high-sounding excuse for a playboy because of various ancient moral prejudices. However, now, once again imagining &quot;you and me&quot; who &quot;disappeared in an instant&quot;, all we can remember in the end is &quot;the light that shined on each other when we met&quot;, and I feel more helpless. Because the lost relationship and friendship can no longer be traced in the dark night, the only thing that can be remembered is the memory as bright as the starlight. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Modern psychology classifies &quot;death of relatives and friends&quot;, &quot;broken love&quot;, &quot;unemployment&quot; and &quot;loss of money&quot; as &quot;loss&quot;. Loss is difficult to digest, because no matter how much we mourn, how much we regret, how much we grieve, we cannot get rid of the reality that it is hard to recover. I have not been close to people since I was a child, so once I lose someone close to me, it is difficult to recover. Even today, seventeen years after my grandfather passed away, I still miss him and walk with him on familiar streets in my dreams. Even though I am clearly aware that I am in a dream, I still hope that this dream can last longer. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Faced with losses, many people will eventually fall into the mentality of gamblers, constantly increasing their bets in order to win back everything they have lost before, so that they fall deeper and deeper into the trap. I have met friends who have always been in good schools. Because of a failure in an exam or failure in applying to a prestigious school, they kept applying year after year, so that all the meaning of life lies in whether they can get back this one. After falling out of love, many people will rush into the next relationship, eager to turn the previous failure experience into the next success. Unfortunately, this kind of eagerness for success will probably only suffer greater trauma. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This year, I also sat alone in the mire-like darkness, and almost fell into the never-ending gambler&#39;s mentality. Finally, the famous words of the ancient Roman Neo-Stoic philosopher Epictetus woke me up: &quot;Don&#39;t think of loss as loss, think of it as return.&quot; In other words, those dazzling moments when the stars meet are never It does not belong to me, but it is temporarily loaned to me by the universe. One day, I must return this gift. All I can do is try to cherish it while borrowing it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Who is opening this generous &quot;library&quot; behind the world? I don&#39;t know, I don&#39;t have the answer. All I know is that those who believe in gods are blessed, and they can draw more strength from their faith to survive the dark night. Let&#39;s take the loss as an example. A devout believer will shed his attachment to himself. Without attachment, there is no need to go bankrupt just to save face. Without attachment, he will feel that when he walks in the world, all encounters and companionship are worthy of gratitude. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the British poet WH Auden&#39;s famous work &quot;More Love&quot; (translated by Huang Canran), Auden regards the burning of stars as &quot;the unrequited passion of mankind&quot;, because of this love Only with the admiration and gratitude of the stars can he say: &quot;If all the stars fall or disappear, / I will learn to look at an empty sky / and feel the solemnity of its complete darkness, / although it may take me a while .&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 11 Oct 2023 23:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[浙江国祥 IPO申购前夕暂停，谁欲分享资本盛宴？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258403]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-11 22:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/11/EzqH3Y4F6QmiFFWlwVxyIw3QnpuhD4Fv75Ob7Szf.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1268&quot; height=&quot;845&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/EzqH3Y4F6QmiFFWlwVxyIw3Q npuhD4Fv75Ob7Szf. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253745&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Retailers play cards on the exchange. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhejiang Guoxiang, which plans to start subscribing in the secondary market on October 9, 2023, due to Public opinion surged, and the Shanghai Stock Exchange actually stopped the IPO. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 7, the first day of resumption of work after the holiday, the Shanghai Stock Exchange issued a response to reporters&#39; questions, saying that in the spirit of being responsible for the market and investors, it would respond to the situation reported by the self-media and treat Zhejiang Guoxiang Conduct a special inspection. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; According to the prospectus, Zhejiang Guoxiang was established in 2009 and is headquartered in Shaoxing City. It is mainly engaged in the research and development, production and sales of industrial and commercial central air-conditioning special equipment. It has served Luxshare Precision, BYD, and Ningde Well-known customers and projects in various industries such as Times, Hangzhou Metro Group, Shanghai Ruijin Hospital, and Beijing Winter Olympics. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In August 2015, Zhejiang Guoxiang was listed on the New Third Board, and submitted prospectus materials to the main board of the Shanghai Stock Exchange and the Science and Technology Innovation Board twice at the end of 2016 and in 2020, but the IPO failed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In March 2023, Zhejiang Guoxiang once again impacted the main board of the Shanghai Stock Exchange. It took 159 days to obtain approval from the China Securities Regulatory Commission for its IPO registration, which was just one step away from success. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On September 27, Zhejiang Guoxiang announced an issue price of 68.07 yuan per share, with an issue price-to-earnings ratio of 51.29 times. The plan was to open subscriptions on October 9. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Unexpectedly, after a short holiday, the clamor that its issue price was too high has become louder and louder. In addition, there have been doubts about Zhejiang Guoxiang&#39;s secondary listing of the same asset in the past, and the controversy has intensified. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 9, the Shanghai Stock Exchange once again issued a response to the suspension of IPO issuance by Zhejiang Guoxiang, introducing the Shanghai Stock Exchange’s preliminary review and supervision of the company, and stated that in response to the market and the majority of investors, Concerned, the Shanghai Stock Exchange will seriously organize a special inspection of Zhejiang Guoxiang and will decide on follow-up work based on the results of the special inspection. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Why did Zhejiang Guoxiang cause public outrage? &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Second listing of the same asset? &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;According to the prospectus, Zhejiang Guoxiang’s assets come indirectly from Zhejiang Guoxiang Refrigeration Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as Guoxiang Refrigeration), which is the first Taiwan-funded enterprise listed on the A-share market. , which is quite symbolic in the mainland capital market. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Taihai.com reported in 2008 that the parent company of Guoxiang Refrigeration was Guoxiang Refrigeration Machinery Company, which was established in Taoyuan, Taiwan in 1966. It was the largest manufacturer of industrial refrigeration and air-conditioning equipment in Taiwan at the time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The above report stated that in 1995, Chen Hegui, chairman of Guoxiang Refrigeration Machinery Company, went to Zhejiang to invest and established Guoxiang Refrigeration as a joint venture with Zhejiang Shaoxing Refrigeration Equipment Factory. After that, Chen Tianlin succeeded his father Chen Hegui and became the chairman of Guoxiang Refrigeration. Guoxiang Refrigeration was listed on the A-share market in 2003 with the stock code 600340. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Due to subjective and objective factors such as poor operating conditions, Guoxiang Refrigeration suffered continuous losses in 2007 and 2008. In May 2009, it was issued a delisting risk warning and became *ST Guoxiang. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In July 2009, Guoxiang Refrigeration announced that it planned to sell out all its existing assets and liabilities through major asset swaps and the issuance of shares to Xingfu Foundation, and at the same time inject the shares held by Xingfu Foundation into Real estate development and regional development business assets. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One month ago, Chen Tianlin resigned as chairman of Guoxiang Refrigeration, and Chen Genwei served as chairman and general manager of Guoxiang Refrigeration. Chen Genwei has been working for Guoxiang Refrigeration since 1997, and has successively served as section chief of the Quality Assurance Department, Secretary of the Board of Directors, and Director. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In September 2011, Guoxiang Refrigeration Asset Restructuring received approval from the China Securities Regulatory Commission, and the real estate company China Fortune Land Development successfully used its shell to go public. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since China Fortune Land Development’s main business is real estate investment and development and has no intention of operating central air-conditioning business, in 2012, Zhejiang Guoxiang Holdings Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as Guoxiang Holdings) controlled by Chen Genwei and his wife used 80 million to acquire the transfer Zhejiang Guoxiang has 100% equity, and Chen Genwei has also been promoted to chairman of Zhejiang Guoxiang. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Retailers therefore questioned Zhejiang Guoxiang’s IPO, which was considered a secondary listing of the same asset. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, during the IPO application process of Zhejiang Guoxiang in 2020 and this time, the Shanghai Stock Exchange made inquiries about the source of Zhejiang Guoxiang’s assets. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In March 2023, the Shanghai Stock Exchange asked Zhejiang Guoxiang to explain the proportion of its assets from the original listed company in its current assets and the role of its production and operations in its inquiry. It also asked the company to combine Past cases in the capital market indicate whether there are similar precedents in which the assets of a listed company were reorganized and then relisted with the same assets. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhejiang Guoxiang listed a number of similar cases in its reply, such as Sichuan Instruments (603100.SH), Leon Micro (605358.SH), etc., saying that their main assets came from listed companies’ acquisitions. out assets. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Regarding the secondary listing, the Shanghai Stock Exchange stated in its response to reporters on October 9 that after review, the transactions of this part of the assets occurred in 2011 and 2012, and the total book assets related to the acquisition at the end of 2022 The relevant net fixed assets accounted for 15% and 0.06% of Zhejiang Guoxiang’s total existing assets respectively. Zhejiang Guoxiang has shifted from focusing on commercial central air conditioners to mainly industrial central air conditioners. Its business, products, and technology Substantial changes have taken place in research and development, personnel and sales models, actual controllers and management. At the same time, there is basically no overlap between Zhejiang Guoxiang’s sales customers and suppliers and *ST Guoxiang. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Regarding listing standards, the Shanghai Stock Exchange quoted Zhejiang Guoxiang’s prospectus, saying that its cumulative net profit in the past three years was 387 million yuan, its net profit in the most recent year was 186 million yuan, and its cash generated from operating activities in the past three years The cumulative net flow was 600 million yuan, and the cumulative operating income was 4.226 billion yuan. &quot;Zhejiang Guoxiang complies with the first set of motherboard listing standards.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/IMsplTUYVODSvJG1Hixdfl4GpDumv6wy93BY5qAF.jpg &quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1268&quot; height=&quot;846&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/IMsplTUYVODSvJG1Hixdfl4GpDumv6wy93BY5qAF.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot; 253746&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The closing stock index of the day is displayed on an LED screen outside a building in Lujiazui, Shanghai. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Super Raising&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;1.4&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Billion Yuan&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In addition to the secondary listing, the trigger for IPO controversy is also the excessive issue price. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhejiang Guoxiang’s issue price is 68.07 yuan per share, and the issue price-to-earnings ratio is 51.29 times. Such a high issue price was also beyond Zhejiang Guoxiang&#39;s expectations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The announcement shows that the company is expected to use 737 million yuan in raised funds for this fundraising project. Based on the issue price of 68.07 yuan per share and the number of new shares issued of 35.0234 million shares, if this issuance is successful, Zhejiang Guoxiang is expected to raise a total of 2.384 billion yuan, after deducting the issuance expenses (excluding value-added tax) of 227.8 million yuan, The net amount of funds raised is expected to be 2.156 billion yuan, with an excess of 1.419 billion yuan raised. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhejiang Guoxiang&#39;s issue price-to-earnings ratio of 51.29 times is not only higher than the industry average, but also higher than the comparable companies in the industry it lists. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the &quot;special equipment manufacturing industry (C35)&quot; in which it is located, as of September 26, 2023, the static average price-to-earnings ratio of C35 in the CSI Index industry in the past month was 27.81 times. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhejiang Guoxiang disclosed five comparable companies in the same industry. After excluding the extreme value Jialitu (180.3 times) and the loss-making Yimikang, the average price-to-earnings ratio of the remaining three companies in 2022 is 45.82 times. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The market criticized Zhejiang Guoxiang’s operating performance as being unable to match the issue price. Within the industry, Zhejiang Guoxiang has not yet occupied a dominant position, and its sustained profitability has been repeatedly questioned by the Shanghai Stock Exchange. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhejiang Guoxiang stated in the prospectus that since its establishment, it has been focusing on the research and development, production and sales of industrial and commercial central air-conditioning. After years of efforts, it has grown into a relatively large player in the industrial and commercial central air-conditioning industry. An enterprise with high brand competitiveness. However, the company&#39;s market shares in 2020, 2021 and 2022 are only 1.20%, 1.28% and 1.77% respectively. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The announcement shows that Zhejiang Guoxiang’s revenue increased from 470 million yuan to 834 million yuan from 2015 to 2019. However, its net profit fluctuated greatly, which were 53.3466 million yuan, 47.1391 million yuan, and 28.3440 yuan respectively. Ten thousand yuan, 43.937 million yuan, 67.3813 million yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the three years of the epidemic from 2020 to 2022, Zhejiang Guoxiang not only increased its revenue steadily, but its net profit also increased significantly, reaching 99.7907 million yuan, 101.3427 million yuan and 185.9114 million yuan respectively. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During this IPO issuance process, the first question in the implementation letter of the Shanghai Stock Exchange Review Center required Zhejiang Guoxiang to disclose the matching of its net profit growth in 2022 with the company&#39;s revenue growth, and analyze the rapid revenue growth in 2022 The main logic of growth and the sustainability of future growth, and reveal the risks of unsustainable rapid growth and provide reminders of major matters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the Shanghai Stock Exchange Listing Committee meeting held on June 19, the Shanghai Stock Exchange once again required Zhejiang Guoxiang to explain whether its ability to continue operating has been significantly improved and improved based on the fact that its assets came from the original listed company *ST Guoxiang. , whether the relevant risk disclosure is sufficient. At the same time, the sponsor representative is requested to express clear opinions. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;The motivation for institutions to create new products at high prices&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The high issuance price is reported by institutional investors during the inquiry period. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The announcement shows that a total of 8,732 placement targets managed by 800 offline investors participated in Zhejiang Guoxiang’s preliminary inquiry. The quotation range is 7.80 yuan/share-103.50 yuan/share, corresponding to the total number of proposed subscriptions. The total number of shares sold was 51.074 billion, and the overall offline subscription multiple was 2,700 times the initial offline issuance scale before the callback. Quotation subscriptions were relatively active. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After excluding invalid quotes and the highest quotes, there are still 733 investors, corresponding to 8,547 allotment objects. The highest quotes excluded refer to allotment objects whose subscription price is higher than 81.49 yuan/share, and allotment objects whose subscription price is 81.49 yuan/share and whose planned subscription quantity is less than 3.8 million shares. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The lower of the average and the median quotes from offline investors is 73.6 yuan/share. Among them, the median quotations from public funds, fund management companies, insurance companies, securities companies, futures companies, trust companies and private equity funds are all around 74 yuan, which is higher than the final issuance price of 69.07 yuan per share. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among public funds, this is especially true for those who quote high prices. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Seventeen products of Golden Eagle Fund quoted a high price of 92.52 yuan per share, a 33.9% premium to the issue price, and were all eliminated. 29 products under Harvest Fund quoted 81.94 yuan per share. They were eliminated because the number of planned subscriptions was less than 3.8 million shares. Another 122 products with the same quotation met the subscription quantity requirements and were shortlisted. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among the valid quotes, Wells Fargo Fund (quoted at 80.75 yuan/share), Chuangjin Hexin (quoted at 80 yuan/share), Shenwan Lingxin Fund (quoted at 79 yuan/share), ICBC Credit Suisse Fund and CCB Credit Fund (quoted at 79 yuan/share) The quotations of public funds such as 78 yuan/share) far exceeded the issue price. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Why is a company whose performance is really not impressive so sought after by institutions? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A private equity fund person explained to Southern Weekend reporters that the issue price pricing rules are relatively complex, involving the average and median of institutional quotations, and the average and median of quotations from social security funds, pension insurance, etc. Compare. The inquiry for new stocks only eliminates 1% of the high prices. As long as the quotation is slightly higher than the average price, institutions can be shortlisted and finally get the new stocks at the issue price. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If new stocks in the market have a good profit-making effect recently, or the subject of new stocks is popular, institutions will increase their quotations to ensure shortlisting. The person said frankly, &quot;Regardless of the finalists, we all point to other institutions to look at the fundamentals. In fact, no one looks at it.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The main board’s new stock inquiry and pricing mechanism originally had an invisible ceiling of 23 times the price-earnings ratio. After the comprehensive registration system reform was launched, the company&#39;s issuance price was liberalized. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At that time, market voices generally believed that companies to be listed with good development prospects would obtain higher valuation levels in the issuance of new shares, and companies with relatively limited development space would see their valuations return quickly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Former senior sponsor Wang Jiyue told Southern Weekend reporters that after the new IPO policy, the supply of new shares was low and the risk of new shares was expected to be low, so prices went up. Not only the institutional quotations of Zhejiang Guoxiang are high, but the overall quotations of new shares are also high. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“There are some irresponsible quotations.” Wang Jiyue analyzed that the reason why institutions quoted high prices was because they expected that the stock price would not break within a few days after listing. Loss is a small probability event and does not affect the interests of fund managers. , the quotation is not binding. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Institutional quotations have become based on transaction expectations, rather than based on the company’s true value.” In his view, the meaning of the existence of institutional investors is to guide correct quotations. &quot;The power to set the issue price is in the hands of institutions, and there are not many practical constraints on institutional quotations.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Institutional investors who participated in the inquiry also attributed the motivation for high-priced new products to &quot;making money from new products in the near future.&quot; Private equity fund Shiva Mavericks has 6 products quoted at 73.65 yuan, which were shortlisted for Zhejiang Guoxiang’s effective quotes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liang Hong, the manager of Shiva Mavericks Fund who is known as the &quot;Ten Billion Private Equity Boss&quot;, responded to the quotation in Xueqiu and said, &quot;Monguli will have obvious profit-making effects in the future, and it will sell on the first day of trading.&quot; The average profit is 80%, so the main purpose is to seek finalists for quotations, and don’t care about the price. If you lose money after a few losses, then you have to be selective and quote a lower price.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Liang Hong’s view, the problem lies in the high-priced IPOs, rather than in recruiting new ones. &quot;Some people say that this or that company is not worth the money, so why should they pay a high price? I want to know even more, why do they take over the market at a high price after there is so much money after listing? If not, why should I call you?&quot; At present, Liang Hong is Messages have been deleted. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So after the new shares are listed, who will take over? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xueqiu user &quot;Xiaye Guapeng&quot; cleverly discovered that for stocks listed at the end of each quarter, through the top ten circulating shareholders disclosed by them, we can know what the new shares will be after 5 trading days. Which funds are taking over. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is no limit on the price of new shares in the first five trading days, and they are subject to special regulatory attention. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Based on this logic, he analyzed 9 stocks that were listed at the end of each quarter in 2022 and 2023, and found that securities companies, which are strongly related to the issuance of new shares, will use their own funds to make large-scale purchases a few days after listing. Buy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, Zhiou Technology (301376.SZ) and Guoke Military Industry (688543.SH), which were listed on June 21, 2023, the ten largest circulating shareholders disclosed in the interim report include the securities firm CICC , CITIC Securities, Huatai Securities, Guotai Junan Securities and China Merchants Securities, and they are all new shareholders. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Wang Jiyue’s view, high-priced innovation by institutions is not a single issue. &quot;New stock pricing rules, new stock supply and demand, stock circulation ratio, and behavioral finance under the tradition of new stock speculation all need to be taken into consideration.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Hundreds of millions of underwriting fees are suspended&lt;/strong>; &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Stock investors also have doubts about Orient Securities (600958.SH), the sponsor of Zhejiang Guoxiang, and believe that Orient Securities has not been diligent and responsible. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Orient Securities’ sponsorship fee for undertaking Zhejiang Guoxiang’s IPO this time is 2 million yuan. In addition, Orient Securities is also the underwriter, and underwriting fees are charged based on a certain proportion of the total funds raised. This is the more important income of Orient Securities in this IPO. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhejiang Guoxiang’s prospectus shows that the underwriting fees charged by Orient Securities vary according to the total amount of funds raised, and the rate ratio fluctuates in three levels: 7.50%, 7.70%, and 8.70%, and different fixed fees are also attached. cost. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Based on Zhejiang Guoxiang’s total fund-raising of 2.384 billion yuan, Orient Securities can receive over 184 million yuan in underwriting fees. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the first half of 2023, the total revenue of Orient Securities’ investment banking business was 741.5 million yuan. Zhejiang Guoxiang’s underwriting fee of nearly 200 million yuan is of great significance to its performance in the second half of the year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 10, Orient Securities issued an announcement on the investment banking project, stating that the underwriting rate for the Zhejiang Guoxiang issuance was 7.74% as determined through negotiation between the sponsor and the issuer. However, the specific calculation method was not disclosed. Zhejiang Guoxiang&#39;s issuance has been suspended, and Orient Securities has not yet collected underwriting fees. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to Zhejiang Guoxiang’s prospectus, the company also has indirect equity relationships with Orient Securities and its affiliates. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Orient Securities Hande holds 2.74% of the total pre-issuance share capital of Zhejiang Guoxiang, while Shanghai Orient Securities Capital Investment Co., Ltd., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Orient Securities, invested 11.11% in Orient Securities Hande. In other words, Orient Securities indirectly holds 0.03% of the shares of Zhejiang Guoxiang before its listing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhejiang Guoxiang’s controlling shareholder Guoxiang Holdings holds 16.34%, 14.71%, 4.44% and 12.51% of the capital contributions of Orient Securities Zhoude, Orient Securities Tangde, Orient Securities Xia De, and Orient Securities Hechuang respectively. share. Shanghai Orient Securities Capital Investment Co., Ltd., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Orient Securities, holds 15.03%, 19.12%, 18.89% and 19.99% of the investment shares of these four companies respectively. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The above-mentioned five companies named &quot;Orient Securities&quot; are all investment institutions mainly funded by Shanghai Oriental Securities Capital Investment Co., Ltd. and serving as executive partners. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Oriental Securities has been investigated by the China Securities Regulatory Commission. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On December 15, 2016, two penalty decisions issued by the China Securities Regulatory Commission disclosed the entire process of creating the &quot;demon stock&quot; of Anshuo Information (300380.SZ), which Oriental Securities was mainly involved in. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On April 30, 2014, a then computer industry researcher from Orient Securities sent an email to the chairman and general manager of Anshuo Information, saying that the stock price of Anshuo Information had fallen to near the issue price and that the value was absolutely underestimated. , expressed the hope to communicate with the company and then recommend it to the organization. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From June 22, 2014 to April 30, 2015, the then chief analyst of the computer industry at Orient Securities and the above-mentioned researcher used &quot;extremely business scalable, strongly optimistic, and the best quality banking IT&quot; We wrote emails with inductive and exaggerated words such as &quot;Target, Unparalleled, Absolutely Leading&quot;, and sent a total of more than 11,000 emails to 1,279 people in 128 funds, securities firms, private equity and other institutions, disseminating iShares information to carry out Internet financial services and the Internet. financial business situation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some fund management companies bought a large amount of iShares Information from November 1, 2014 to May 27, 2015. At the peak, a total of 221 public funds held more than 70% of iShares Information. outstanding shares. Anshuo Information&#39;s stock price rose from 28.30 yuan/share on April 30, 2014 to 450 yuan/share on May 13, 2015, an increase of 15.9 times. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the China Securities Regulatory Commission opened the case for investigation, the above two employees of Orient Securities were ordered to make corrections and were given administrative penalties of 200,000 yuan and 150,000 yuan respectively, and a warning was given to Anshuo Information and the company’s chairman and secretary. , and were fined 600,000 yuan, 300,000 yuan and 200,000 yuan respectively. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 11 Oct 2023 22:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[147万名“塔尖”客户金融资产21万亿，“最耀眼明珠”撑起银行逆周期重任]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258401]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-11 21:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;span>;After the existing mortgage interest rates were reduced in batches&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;,&lt;/span>;&lt; span>;Almost all deposit and loan business interest rate spreads fell&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;to&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;historical lows&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;,&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;very cyclical businesses Do banks still have countercyclical sectors?&lt;/span>;&lt;span>; &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The latest &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;2023&lt;/span>;&lt;span>; mid-year reports disclosed by various commercial banks revealed an unusual information&lt;/span>;&lt; span>;. &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;Researcher from Southern Weekend New Financial Research Center&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;Taked relevant data of 12 major banks as a sample, &lt;/span>;&lt;span>; combined with research reports from professional consulting institutions&lt;/span>;&lt; span>;, &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;from &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;Private&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;People&#39;s Bank of China&lt;/span>;&lt;span>; Bank&lt;/span>;&lt;span>; (&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Hereinafter referred to as &quot;private bank&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;)&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;Number of clients and &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;structure&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;, &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;Assets per capita&lt; /span>;&lt;span>;The development status and influencing factors of private banks were &lt;/span>;&lt;span>; sorted out, compared and analyzed from dimensions such as /span>;&lt;span>;, private bank asset management scale and other dimensions.

&lt;p>;&lt;span>;私&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;行&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;业务何以让各商行趋之若鹜？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;私行业务对银行来说基本属于表外业务，资本占用小&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;，&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;属于轻资本业务&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;。近年来，在面临净息差收缩、不良资产等问题时，银行业规模驱动的重资本发展模式承压。私行业务有望成为银行自身盈利增长&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;和&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;业务模式转型的新引擎。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;南方周末新金融&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;研究&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;中心研究员&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;梳理&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;上述12家银行&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;2023&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;年中报&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;发现，工行用了少量篇幅对私人银行的盈利数据进行描述。数据显示，截至6月30日，该行“个人理财及私人银行”项下实现手续费及佣金收入140.19亿元，占该行全部手续费及佣金收入的17.02%，占比排名仅次于“结算、清算及现金管理”项，位列第二。由于此项收入也涉及包含普通客户在内的个人理财项，因此无法对私行业务的收入情况进行精确统计。下表中关于私行AUM在零售业务AUM中占比或许能从侧面佐证其在零售业务领域的贡献率。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/yMbrIwXun5ui95CTO0MULgNQdfEVd7kptfYGJg9B.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1256&quot; height=&quot;953&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/yMbrIwXun5ui95CTO0MULgNQdfEVd7kptfYGJg9B.jpg&quot;

&lt;p>;&lt;span>;南方周末新金融研究中心研究员对比财报数据发现，&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;2023&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;年&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;前6个月，招行零售客户存款利率成本仅为1.36%，不仅远低于同等体量股份制银行2%&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;-&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;2.4%的区间标准，甚至低于国有行1.7%左右的水平。 &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;这证明&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;，当私行业务发展到一定规模之时，对降低银行存款成本具有正向作用。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/C8wIZtTf1G95F9pNss8iDxG1mQ6cxWOozLJemKrw.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;953&quot; height=&quot;1256&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/C8wIZtTf1G95F9pNss8iDxG1mQ6cxWOozLJemKrw.jpg&quot;

&lt;p>;&lt;span>;基于私行客户的特殊贡献和诉求&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;，&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;商业银行对私行客户储备和创新了哪些金融工具&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;南方周末新金融研究中心研究员发现，作为私行资产配置池中的工具之一，具备传承及破产隔离功能的家族信托正被广泛运用。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;工、农、中、建、交5家国有大行&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;和&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;招行、平安银行等&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;股份制银行&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;，&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;均在&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;中报&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;中&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;对&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;家族信托的业务增长数据进行了描述。截至6月底，工行家族信托累计实收规模291.8亿元，比上年末增长40%；建行实收资金规模为950.74亿元，较上年末增长6.82%；中行家族信托客户数较上年末增长52.5%；农行家族信托业务规模近800亿元，较上年末净增320亿元；平安银行家族信托及保险金信托规模为440.86亿元，同比增长39.3%；招行家族信托业务单数突破万单，业务规模较上年末增长22.79%。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;南方周末新金融研究中心研究员调研发现&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;，&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;保险信托因其有杠杆和传承等功能&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;，&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;最近两年也成为热门配置&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;有&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;私行&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;从业&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;人&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;员对南方周末新金融研究中心研究员称&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;，&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;受限于经营范围，目前银行为私行客户设立信托均以和外部信托公司合作的模式进行。但于投资者而言，透过银行委托其私人财产相当于在心理上获得了银行的品牌背书&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;。 &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;这两年银行私行客户数量和资产规模仍然呈现出不断增长态势，包括家族信托等财富的增长，显示出在面临着不确定的环境中，高净值人群仍然愿意将财富存放在银行体系。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;《2023中国私人财富报告》&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;也&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;提及，作为“先富”人群，&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;私行客户&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;的综合需求从关注个人、家庭、企业，扩展到社会责任、公益和慈善领域，期待有更好的慈善项目和慈善基金会、慈善信托等慈善架构设计服务。调研显示，73%高净值人群已开始或已在准备财富传承事宜，在代际传承的方式上，当前高净值人群首&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;选&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;方式是为子女购买保险和购置房产，未来预计拓展的方式包括创设家族信托和企业股权安排等。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&lt;span>;私行&lt;/span>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;&lt;span>;尚&lt;/span>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;&lt;span>;处于初级阶段&lt;/span>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;对标国际私行&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;，&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;国内愈加重视的私行处于什么水平&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;自金融&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;监管部门于2005年首次提出私人银行业务概念，中国私人银行业已走过十余年&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;历程&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;这十多年间&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;，&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;国内多家商业银行纷纷开设相关业务，&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;资产规模快速增长。 &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;其间&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;，&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;虽曾有多家银行将私行业务单独设置为事业部制&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;，&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;全国性垂直管理&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;，&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;但分设之后&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;，&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;又回归大零售体系&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;，&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;并且&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;有加速之势&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;若以欧洲发达国家成熟的私人银行体系为参照，国内私行无论是从财富管理的覆盖范围还是客户服务水平等方面，均处于初级阶段。这或许是目前国内多家银行仍将私行业务放入大零售框架中，未进行单独核算的原因之一。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;关于国内私行业务的发展，南方周末新金融研究中心研究员认为可从&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;如下&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;三方面着手：&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;一是加强投研及专业产品设计能力，并丰富产品体系。持续跟踪客户需求及市场变化，及时调整资产配置策略和产品结构。提高大类资产配置水准，通过海外多元化的资产配置，实现地域性的多元化和资产类别的多元化，帮助投资者保证投资收益及资产保值增值；&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;二是透过科技助力打造数字化私人银行。随着技术的飞速发展，金融科技与财富管理领域不断深化融合，其应用链条也将从客户端逐步渗透到产品研发、投资组合、估值管理等产品端环节。借助金融科技，为投资顾问提供投资建议，进行操作预警，跟踪客户投资进展，大幅提升私人银行服务效率和客户体验；&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;三是重视非金融业务。 &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;区别于传统财富管理业务，私行&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;的业务范畴&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;包含金融服务和非金融业务，其中非金融业务涉及的业务领域非常广泛，包含投资咨询、税务规划、生活消费、医疗健康、旅游等。 &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;在国际&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;成熟的私人银行体系中，非金融领域产生的咨询管理费有望占到总体收入的45%&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;。 &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;国内私行可以此为发力点，&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;链接各类专业机构&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;，&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;创造更多&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;收益&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;据上海蓝天应急救援服务中心（以下简称上海蓝天救援中心）工作人员的说法，上海4岁半女童于2023年10月4日傍晚在海滩走失后，他们第二天就从家属处接到了搜救需求。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但10月7日，该中心发布消息称，救援队“原本计划今晚开展搜救任务，由于某些原因被中止”。声明还称，后续任何以“上海蓝天救援队”名义在救援现场开展的活动，均与其无关。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;第二天，另一支带有“蓝天救援”标识的团队“BSR蓝天救援”也向媒体发布消息称，上述声明系另一拨人擅自发布，不代表蓝天救援队官方态度，蓝天救援队一直在现场搜救4岁女童，并未停止。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;南方周末记者发现，双方冲突背后是蓝天救援队持续数年的“分家”纠葛，蓝天救援队创始人张勇一方和北京蓝天救援目前的法定代表人曹伟伟一方都主张自己与“蓝天救援队”的正当性——“蓝天”品牌，成了双方争夺的焦点。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;同时搜救&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;上海蓝天救援中心一名工作人员告诉南方周末记者，10月5日，他们受家属委托，来到南汇新城海滩开展搜救，并将此次搜救行动上报了浦东新区应急管理局。 “天黑了以后，我们还用无人机（照明搜救）。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这名工作人员并未透露7日撤离的具体原因：“不方便说，只是撤离那个区域。”目前“政府一直在搜救”。但这位工作人员也表示，自己这两天在搜救现场同时也见到了其他“蓝天救援队”。 “对方开始以为我们是一起的，我说不是。他也奇怪，怎么会有另外一支蓝天（救援队）？”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;该工作人员愤慨地表示，此前在一些灾害现场，有一些救援队伍会打着“蓝天救援队”的名号开展行动，有的会在微信群里筹款，收款人却是个人账户，有的表示要收费才能消杀，以致他们要向警方报案。 “做公益就好好做公益，如果真有能力，就不要用别人的名字。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;现场确实有另外的“蓝天救援队”参与了救援。 10月9日下午，何冬平告诉南方周末记者，他作为上海机动蓝天救援队的队长，从5日到9日，受家属委托，一直参与女童的搜救，目前搜救还在进行。何冬平介绍，自己同时也是上文“BSR蓝天救援”的队员，“BSR”为蓝天救援队英文缩写。不过，他“不好评价”另一支队伍上海蓝天救援中心从搜救现场撤离的事件。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;企查查信息显示，上海蓝天应急救援服务中心成立于2014年7月，法定代表人为杨春明，长期以来，这也是上海唯一一家注册为蓝天救援的社会组织，直到2023年9月21日，一家名为“上海市宝山蓝天救援队”的民办非企业机构登记成立。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;何冬平介绍，上海市宝山蓝天救援队是他们在民政部门登记注册的名称，上海机动蓝天救援队、上海蓝天救援队、上海青浦蓝天救援队和上海大学生蓝天救援队都是其下辖的队伍。平日里，这四支队伍由一个名为“上海蓝天救援协调中心”的内部机构统筹，各支队伍按照不同的职能和地域开展救援工作。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;何冬平称，上海这四支“蓝天救援”队伍的品牌，是从北京蓝天救援队取得的授权。此前他和队友们已经以“蓝天救援队”的名义做了多年搜救，但2023年以前，地方民政部门不能注册以“队”字结尾的民非组织，“为了名正言顺”，他们2023年正式在民政部门注册成为“蓝天救援队”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;何冬平认为，上海蓝天救援中心虽然与他们有着一模一样的服装，实质上却是“多年前就取消了给他们的授权”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;据何冬平所述，搜救现场风急浪大，曾有政府部门工作人员找到他们核实，哪支是真正的蓝天救援队，以及队伍的技能和装备情况，“我们如实告知了过后，就请他们离开了”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;争夺“蓝天救援”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;但南方周末记者发现，上海蓝天救援中心同样是在民政部门注册的民办非企业机构。它们的区别，其实在于分属于不同的蓝天救援体系。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;上海蓝天救援中心及其队员的名单列在网站“蓝天救援信息公开平台”上；上海机动蓝天救援队等四支蓝天救援队的人员名单，则登载在网站“蓝天救援.中国”上。通过域名检索系统和天眼查，上述两个域名的所有人分别是广东蓝天救援队法定代表人池翔和上海小救星科技有限公司法定代表人何冬平。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“蓝天救援信息公开平台”登载的信息显示，张勇是蓝天救援队的总指挥；“蓝天救援.中国”则显示，曹伟伟是蓝天救援队品牌管理的负责人和队长。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2010年，全国最早的蓝天救援队在北京民政局登记注册，成为中国首支具备独立法人资格的、民办非企业性质的民间救援队。提议创立蓝天救援队的张勇曾长期担任北京蓝天救援队（以下简称“北京蓝天”）的法定代表人。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/b3e2a93676.png&quot;

&lt;p>;但张勇随后并不承认这份会议纪要的真实性。中国裁判文书网显示，张勇曾就将他“开除”的理事会纪要向北京蓝天提起诉讼，要求认定四份会议纪要不成立。张勇称，理事会纪要签字系曹伪造。但法院认为，张勇提交的证据不足以证明他的主张，判决张勇败诉。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;此后，微信公众号“远山说”成了张勇这方实际运营的账号。 2020年12月23日，“远山说”曾对事件始末进行说明，称该年初北京蓝天在审计时，发现巨大财务漏洞。经调查，目标指向时任北京蓝天救援队队长的曹伟伟，决定将曹伟伟开除出蓝天救援体系。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但张勇最后成了“被开除”的那个人。 2022年2月，北京蓝天的法定代表人变更为曹伟伟。同年4月，张勇在“远山说”发布一则视频，画面中，他身穿蓝天救援队深蓝色队服，对曾担任自己助理的曹伟伟提出多项质疑，称其为牟取个人利益，通过偷取公章、伪造材料等方式，将北京蓝天的法定代表人变更登记为其个人。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2023年5月31日，“北京蓝天救援队”官方微信公众号发布声明，宣布罢免张勇理事长、理事职务并开除队籍，同时选举曹伟伟担任理事长。 10月1日，该公众号又发布声明，解释张勇被北京蓝天开除的原因是“违纪”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;曹伟伟向南方周末记者解释，开除张勇有很多原因，有“个人问题”，也有他自称“总队长”违反社会团体不能垂直管理的相关规定。 “说白了，就是他现在又和其他人在外边干。”&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;总部与地方队伍的关系&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;上述纠纷背后，是北京“蓝天总部”与各地蓝天救援队之间“品牌授权”的关系。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;中国的民间救援队起初多由户外运动爱好者们自发组成，在经历了2008年汶川大地震和2010年玉树地震后，民间救援力量发展渐成规模。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;《社会团体登记管理条例》规定，社会团体不得设立地域性的分支机构。因此无论张勇方还是曹伟伟方，都声明过已注册的两千多个蓝天救援队与北京蓝天并不存在层级隶属关系。但北京蓝天的纠纷，还是会通过一些无形的资产影响全国其他的蓝天救援队。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2021年4月，“BJBSR”称，全国蓝天救援队沿用了数年的“蓝天救援信息公开平台”已属于池翔个人公司，北京蓝天于2020年与池翔解除合作。目前，北京蓝天持有公众熟知的“BSR蓝天救援圆形标”、BSR方形标、蓝天队服等蓝天救援队的著作权和专利权，张勇一方蓝天救援队的信息则通过“蓝天救援信息公开平台”“远山说”等渠道发布。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;9月30日晚，“远山说”宣布蓝天救援队更换VI标识系统、救援电话，各地包括上海蓝天应急救援服务中心在内的不少蓝天队伍纷纷响应。次日，“北京蓝天救援队”发布回应称“蓝天救援队相关标志、标识并未更新变更”，并再次强调张勇实因“违纪”而被北京蓝天“开除”“罢免”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在“分家”前，2014年，蓝天救援队制定《阜阳公约》，确立了“蓝天救援”的品牌授权模式。北京蓝天为品牌持有方，通过“北京队-各省品牌督导官-各地蓝天队”结构维持全国体系。各地有建队意愿的地方提出申请，北京蓝天派出联络官对其进行审核和考察，经考核符合蓝天建队标准的，可以获批建队。北京蓝天授权其使用蓝天救援队的名称和标志，并在各省设立“品牌督导官”，负责监督该省各地蓝天救援队是否按照北京蓝天规定的制度开展活动，不合格则予以除名。地方分队负有执行蓝天救援队各项管理制度、坚守发展理念的义务，但人、财、物由各地救援队独立管理，总部平时不干涉各分队的常规运作，只在进行统一救援时，要求分队服从总部和前线指挥部的调度指挥。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;此后近十年，遍及全国的蓝天救援体系快速发展，一些队伍和人员选择退出，也有更多志愿者希望加入。但从实际的法律地位来看，蓝天总部与全国各地的蓝天队伍是平等的。张勇曾经解释，民间救援队伍可以在当地民政部门登记成为“某蓝天救援”的机构，若这支队伍在登记后，不想加入蓝天救援体系，或已退出蓝天救援体系，也仍可以继续使用“蓝天救援”的注册名称。他们在开展活动时，也并不需要通过总部分派任务。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;曹伟伟向南方周末记者解释，“品牌管理”是一种意向型的合作，统一的商标和队服是为了不同队员间的资源共享和共同理念，除此之外，北京蓝天无法通过其他途径约束各地队伍的行为，“全凭志愿精神”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但一些民间救援队工作人员则有着不同角度的看法。蓝天救援队早期队员、青岛红十字救援队队长李延照向南方周末记者分析，不少民间救援队需要“蓝天”，是因为它有很高的社会知名度，靠着这块“牌子”，很多时候能够“保护自己”。李延照早年因不赞同《阜阳公约》而离开蓝天救援队，在他看来，与统一的“蓝天”品牌相比，民间救援队实际最需要的，还是“专业、规范的操作和救援”。 &lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;到底是工作氛围重要，还是薪资重要，是仁者见仁、智者见智的，并没有统一标准答案。只是大家要注意：工作氛围，不能用简单的“好”或“坏”去定义，关键看是否适合你个人。而考量适合与否，不能是自己模糊的感觉，而要有可衡量的标准，譬如：行业前景、公司发展、领导的能力与魅力、团队协作、工作性质、岗位分工、自己的适合程度，以及薪酬水平。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;如果是夕阳产业、缺乏前途的公司、官僚气息浓重、阿谀奉承盛行、团队勾心斗角、工作氛围压抑、恶意竞争激烈等真正的不良经营状态，选择离开无可厚非，良禽择木而栖嘛。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但如果产业蓬勃发展、公司前途良好、企业充满朝气、领导和业务骨干能力很强、团队合作密切、同事关系融洽、竞争虽激烈但制度公平、赏罚分明……仅仅是自己暂时不适应、跟不上节奏、自尊心暂时受挫，仅凭一些若有若无的感觉，就轻易放弃得来不易的Offer，这就不太好了。毕竟，入职仅仅几天，是很难全面、客观了解一个企业和相关产业的。而短时间内频繁入职离职，对个人在职场上的求职信用，也有不良影响。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;二十多年前，本人年轻时，也曾有几次入职时间较短就迅速离职经历，那是因感到公司较小、设备较落后、所承接的业务也较小较低端，对自己前途不利。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;后来有机会进4A广告公司，刚开始蛮受气的，工作氛围并不好，“资深创意”不愿教我这种“设计助理”新人，创意总监（Creative Director）基本不拿正眼瞧我。但是，看到公司那么多获奖作品、代理的都是大企业广告、CD和SC在开会时分析问题的精深见解，以及创意部那么多苹果“麦金塔”图形工作站……感到自己有幸进了殿堂级创意企业，只要人家不用脚硬踹我走，就一定要留下，并把他们的本领都学到手。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;后来，我做到创意总监，也面对过新员工入职几天即离职的问题，其理由是：觉得公司的大哥大姐们对其不够尊重，这位新员工在校时曾担任过学生会干部，大概其他同学平素对他都客客气气，习惯了，突然进入一家公司，成为团队之末，心理落差太大。这就不是公司“氛围不好”，而是他个人“心态不好”了。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一位猎头公司的HR朋友曾对我说：你打算长期成为打工人，还是以后有可能自己做，在职场上的应对方式不同。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;如果你打算长期做打工人，最后做到职业经理人，那么你的从业经历初期，就要频繁跳槽，以尽可能丰富阅历、寻找机会。而逐渐成熟后，就要减慢易职频率，以积淀自己的职场人设。因现在猎头市场都是联网的，Boss和董事会对高职管理人员的职场道德要求越来越严格，从以前的“唯才是举”逐渐向“德才兼备”发展。在创业初期，自己还在不太成熟的市场上横冲直撞，当然崇尚“唯才是举”。而现在，事业有成者渐入老年，要考虑自己的基业在未来传承给“二代、三代”，所以，他们的用人之道，也开始选择收成类的人才，而避免“不安分”的人升到高层。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;如果你打算以后自己做，那就得找到足够大、足够复杂的公司，充分了解一个产业是怎样运行的，一家企业究竟是怎样运营的，领悟市场和职场中的人们都是怎样生存的，重点是观察市场、领悟人心、参悟人性，而不是“工作氛围”也不是“薪资待遇”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这位HR朋友还认为：“大学生创业”要谨慎，刚从大学毕业，对市场不了解、对人性未洞悉，就负债去创业，甚至耗光了父母的养老金，那就不好了。全球每年几千万大学生毕业，有几个乔布斯、马斯克？ &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;大学生还是先就业，哪怕跳几次槽、经历些世事、初步了解下市场、接触复杂的人性，再自主去创业，成功的概率才会高些。即便如此，也不主张“入职三天就离职”，因为三天时间，啥也学不到，啥也了解不到，甚至这家企业存在啥问题，都发现不了。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;

&lt;p>;Car driving on Prince Edward Road, Kowloon , during the afternoon rush hour, it was suddenly blocked. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is nothing to do at this time, so I have to settle down. There is no way to advance or retreat anyway, so why be upset? Looking outside the car, there are trees on both sides, and all kinds of trees are fluttering in the wind under the sun. There are large clumps of green leaves with varying shapes, some pointed, some round, &amp;nbsp;some long, some short. Probably no one would pay attention to green leaves in normal times. Only in this season when there are no flowers to enjoy, only when the heat is overwhelming and you happen to be in an air-conditioned car, can you enjoy them so easily. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The leaves, lush and small, swayed in the wind. Under the sunlight, they flickered in the sun, as if thousands of small mirrors were vying for beauty. How many times have I passed by this scene? Why do I always turn a blind eye to this scene? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As people grow up, there are many times when they turn a blind eye and turn a blind eye. The rigid daily rhythm has dulled the once sharp mind, and it is no longer possible to feel the subtle and wonderful gifts in life. I don’t know how to cherish everything I have, nor do I think it will be lost in an instant. I always think that everything is inevitable. What is there today will still be there tomorrow. When it is lost in an instant, I am shocked to realize why I didn&#39;t take advantage of it in the first place. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The greenery outside the window reminds me of the years when I was studying in Taiwan when I was young. Materials were really scarce at that time, and broken appliances were repaired again and again; watches had to be worn for a lifetime; there were only three or two pieces of clothing, and they were passed down from brother to brother and from sister to sister. Still, it was a good time. For example, when we were in art class, the teacher often taught us to be ingenious, develop our creativity, and create magnificent and colorful pictures with limited materials. Once, let us draw leaves. The method is to first go to the wild to collect all kinds of green leaves, and then lay out the various leaves on white drawing paper according to your own preference, then cut out a piece of the old screen window to use as a sieve, and lightly paint it with light and dark watercolors. The colors pass through the fine grid and fall on the painting paper like rain and dew. Then the green leaves were uncovered one after another, and each time they were painted with different colors. Finally, a masterpiece with vivid patterns and brilliant colors was finally formed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since then, I have fallen in love with leaves. I like to look at flowers and don’t forget to admire leaves. At that time, I lived in a large courtyard on Heping East Road in Taipei. There were several simple bungalows built in the courtyard, and several families lived there. The martial arts novelist Gu Long also lived there when he was a child. He didn&#39;t like to study and only wanted to write novels. , everyone called him &quot;the son of the Xiong family&quot;. In the middle of the yard is a public open space where chickens are raised and dogs are let out. The remaining narrow corners are filled with some inconspicuous flowers and plants. I don’t know who planted them. There is an oleander tree next to the public toilet. It has bright pink flowers, pointed and long leaves, dark green leaves and light green backs. Several canna plants were planted beside the ditch, some red and some yellow, with egg-elliptical leaves. Although the variety is ordinary, it has swayed in the morning and sunset, adding a lot of interest to life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Taipei at that time, there was a lot of farmland and greenery everywhere. Before moving to Dazayuan, I lived in a place called &quot;Liuzhangli&quot; (what a pastoral name). There was only a fence between the residence and the large farmland. The fence is covered with morning glories. Every sunrise, the purple flowers are in full bloom, resembling trumpets, and the leaves are tender and green, smiling and waving in the morning breeze. No wonder this flower is called Morning Glory in English. In that rice field, you can see buffaloes working hard and farmers working hard all year round. Speaking of green, there is no more beautiful scene than the beautiful spring seedlings and the green color that fills the eyes! &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the way home from school, I often see piles of large green leaves on the streets and in puddles, similar in shape to lotus leaves, but I have never seen a lotus flower in bloom. When I asked an adult, I found out that they were taro leaves. Although taro leaves are ordinary, it turns out that this leaf has a special feature. Whenever it rains, the falling raindrops are sprinkled on the leaf surface, and they will condense into water droplets, rolling back and forth, just like diamonds. When the sun shines after the rain, It looks even more dazzling. I remember once I wrote this scenery into a composition &quot;After the Rain&quot;, which was greatly praised by my class teacher (called a grade teacher in Taiwan) Chen Wenbin. This inspired my love for words, and thus I embarked on a career in literature and translation in the future. the way. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many years later, when I returned to Paris, I was introduced by a friend to the works of French painter Chen Jianzhong. He was good at painting all kinds of leaves. The green leaves in each picture were crystal clear and glowed with the brilliance of life. , exciting. It&#39;s a pity that I didn&#39;t have enough money to buy a treasure back then, and now I can&#39;t even afford the astronomical current price. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;No matter! Just look out and enjoy the greenery outside the window! The layers of green are soothing to the eyes and the mind. I am already very rich and contented. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Canned food&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;When the epidemic is not over and the lockdown is over, I don’t want my Filipino maid to go to the vegetable market often, so just ask her to buy it in the supermarket. As a result, there were more canned soups, luncheon meats, etc. on the table. I usually have no interest in canned food, the only exception being tomato sauce beans. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Every time I go out with my daughter, we always order All Day Breakfast for lunch, and the must-have soybeans in tomato sauce in this dish is my favorite. Whenever my daughter watches me eating beans with gusto, she is always a little puzzled. What is so special about such ordinary food? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sour and sweet, glutinous and crispy, what you taste in your mouth is not just the melt-in-your-mouth feeling of beans in tomato sauce, but also the memory of hard work in your youth. When I was a sophomore in high school, I moved to Hong Kong from Taipei and was lucky enough to be admitted to Pei Ching Middle School. I was unfamiliar with the place and I didn&#39;t know the Cantonese language. I had to take the national college entrance examination a year later. I was caught off guard and I was in a hurry. Fortunately, the whole class did not exclude me, a transfer student from Taiwan. I hung out with everyone every day in school. Within half a year, I could speak Cantonese casually and became as fluent as I am today. At that time, I was only thinking about Taiwan&#39;s university entrance examination. I really didn&#39;t know much about Hong Kong&#39;s high school entrance examination. I only know that my classmates are nervously preparing for the exam, and I am also nervous. There were five or six girls in the class. Some time before the college entrance examination, we would meet from time to time to go back to school on Sundays to review their studies. Mathematics, physics, and chemistry were the highlight. For a new student like me, having someone to work hard with and solve puzzles with after school was certainly a blessing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Life was simple and materially scarce at that time. Five or six young people got together to buy a long loaf of white bread and a can of beans with tomato sauce&amp;nbsp; (This was my first experience with such a thing. canned food), not even soda and juice, so it was our lunch. After reviewing, when my head was dizzy due to the difficult laws of physics, the thorny mathematics problems, and the complexity of biochemical terms, I opened the can, spread the orange soybeans on the white soft bread, and chewed it, but I felt Extremely luscious. I still remember the sour, sweet, crispy and soft fragrance of beans. Along with a cheering gesture and an encouraging look among my classmates, it immediately aroused the feeling of &quot;having the same hatred and the same enemy&quot; in the exam room. A little trouble before the exam, That&#39;s why it was wiped out. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another kind of can is something I can never forget. Before coming to Hong Kong, I studied in Beiyi Girls&#39; School in Taiwan, from the first year of junior high school to the second year of high school. At that time, I lived in a large courtyard on Heping East Road. The landlord&#39;s surname was Yan and he was from Sichuan. Their family has three daughters and three sons. My daughters are all older than me, so after we moved there, I suddenly had three more sisters when I was alone at home. Lucy, the third sister of the Yan family, is a happy girl. She greets everyone with a smile all day long, dances and has many strange thoughts. It was a period of growth at that time. Soon after dinner, my stomach would growl and I couldn&#39;t find anything to eat, so I would follow my third sister around. Lucy said that there is a good way to take the leftover cold rice from dinner and wash it with hot water to turn it into soaked rice. No side dishes, right? Open a can of &quot;Dushan Salt Pickled Cabbage&quot;! &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Dushan Salted Pickled Cabbage&quot; was a famous brand in Taiwan back then. When you open the can, you will be greeted by the aroma of garlic. I don’t know why, maybe it was because I didn’t have any other choice back then! I just remember that every time it was almost midnight, I would hide in the small kitchen with my third sister, top up the hot rice with sour and spicy &quot;Dushan&quot;, and devour it with great joy. My empty stomach would also make me feel incomparable. of satisfaction. Since then, I have fallen in love with peppers and garlic, which seems a bit &quot;deviant&quot; to me as a Shanghainese. However, when I went to Paris to study in the future, I came across &quot;garlic, butter, wine&quot;. For Sanbao’s French cooking, it feels like a fish in water. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When Bei Yi was in junior high school, all students received Scout training. Once, the school asked everyone to go camping, but the camp was not in the countryside, but on the school playground. No matter this, the classmates are still happy and excited. Each class is divided into teams of six or seven people. After each team sets up camp, they have to be responsible for their own cooking. Each team shows off their skills and presents their specialty dishes, which the instructors can taste and rate to compete. I remember that our team had finally set up the tent and was already in a hurry. How could we still have time to cook? In desperation, someone came up with an idea, saying that it would be better to use a magic weapon like &quot;Dushan Salt Pickled Cabbage&quot;! It was almost dusk, and the instructor Shi Shiran came to the field. She may be like the Zao Lord Bodhisattva at the end of the twelfth lunar month. Along the way, she had tried big fish and meat in each team, and her mouth felt a little tired. As soon as she tasted our &quot; &quot;Dushan Salted Pickled Cabbage&quot;, he was so full of praises that he thought it was a supreme delicacy and almost gave us the first prize. This time, everyone was shocked. Isn&#39;t this behavior comparable to cheating in an exam? I no longer remember the result, but this unique experience remains firmly in my mind. I revisited the island many years later and wanted to find a can of &quot;Dushan Salt Pickled Cabbage&quot; in the supermarket. Unfortunately, this brand has long since passed away. As time goes by, the traces of fragrance are gone. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is also a kind of canned chicken that contains boneless chicken. I can’t remember the name. It’s a foreign brand. After graduating from university, he went to the United States to study for a master&#39;s degree. Not long after I arrived, I met Shi, a girl from Taiwan, in the dormitory of Washington University in St. Louis. The two hit it off immediately. The dormitory provides breakfast and dinner, and you can prepare lunch by yourself. In order to save money, the two of us decided to buy a loaf of white bread every lunch, open a can of boneless chicken, and eat it in my room. Shi is majoring in chemical engineering, and her hand strength is stronger than mine. She can do tasks like opening cans with ease. One day at noon, I went back late. When I entered the unlocked door, I found that the room was quiet and there was no one around. When I looked carefully, I saw a half-opened can on the small table with blood stains on the side. ,&amp;nbsp;A drop of blood first flowed to the ground, and then to the door. This scene was like a murder scene, so scary! I followed the bloodstains and hurriedly ran out. The bloodstains led me through the corridor and towards the room at the other end. When I rushed in, I was surprised to see Shi, who was usually tough, pressing his bloody fingers with a nervous look on his face. , at a loss! We hurried to the medical room, not remembering how many stitches she gave. Years later, whenever I think about the frugal years when I was studying in the United States, and the lifelong innocent friendship between our group of girls, I will accidentally think of this canned boneless chicken! &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Three kinds of cans carry three stages of life, from green to mature. Those years were quiet and peaceful, and we spent ordinary and comfortable days; what about now? The wind is blowing and the rain is blowing, and the weather is unpredictable. Looking at the future in the distance, I am speechless. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 11 Oct 2023 18:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[澳大利亚籍人员成蕾被国家安全机关依法执行驱逐出境]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258395]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-11 17:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;span>;On October 11, 2023, Australian citizen Cheng Lei was detained by Beijing after serving her sentence.

This scene has been going on for Palestinians in Gaza for nearly 30 years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But before Hamas launched a new round of attacks, Israel&#39;s intelligence system seemed to &quot;close its eyes.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hamas broke through the Palestinian-Israeli border barrier and sent hundreds of armed personnel to infiltrate into Israeli-controlled areas. Efraim Halevi, the former head of the Israeli intelligence service Mossad, publicly stated that they had not received any form of warning and that &quot;the outbreak of the war was a complete surprise.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;CNN reported that the Gaza Strip is blockaded and closely monitored by the Israeli army, and Palestinian armed personnel are rarely able to enter Israel. But Halevi said the number of rockets fired by Palestinian militants was &quot;unprecedented&quot; and that it was &quot;the first time&quot; they were able to &quot;penetrate deep into Israel and take control of villages.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although Israel is no stranger to Palestinian attacks, this time the Israeli military found itself &quot;unprepared.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“The entire intelligence system failed, it was just one component and failed to provide the necessary defense for Israeli civilians.” said Jonathan Conricks, former international spokesman for the Israel Defense Forces. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since Israel withdrew from Gaza in 2005, it has spent hundreds of millions of dollars building a smart border with sensors and underground walls to protect the border from attacks, Reuters said. The Israeli military also &lt;span>;with the help of the United States developed an &quot;Iron Dome&quot; defense system&lt;/span>; specifically designed to intercept rockets and mortars. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Israeli intelligence agency has been written into a &quot;myth&quot; by domestic and Western media because of a series of &quot;achievements&quot; over the past few decades. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But this time, the &quot;myth&quot; seems to have been shattered by Hamas. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Retired Israeli general Amir Avivi said that militants in Gaza have found ways to evade technical intelligence collection, preventing Israel from fully understanding their intentions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;They have returned to the Stone Age.&quot; Avivi explained that armed personnel do not use phones or computers, but handovers in specialized technical rooms or underground rooms. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Weijian, a researcher at the Foreign Policy Institute of the Shanghai Institutes for International Studies, analyzed to Southern Weekend reporters that although Israel has a complete intelligence system, looking at it conversely, for every set of Israeli practices, the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip The armed forces are also constantly summarizing and taking precautions, and they even have spies in Israel. &quot;It&#39;s entirely possible.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Israel&#39;s &quot;Haaretz&quot; revealed that hundreds of Hamas personnel had been preparing for the raid for months, even more than a year, &quot;but did not leak it&quot;, and the results were obviously disastrous. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Weijian said that by summarizing long-term struggle experience, the Palestinian armed forces may also have grasped some of Israel’s “preventive weaknesses” and found some “preventive rules.” Israel’s military intelligence team cannot be unilaterally assumed So powerful that it is invulnerable. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another point worthy of attention is that Israel’s judicial reforms and political disputes since the beginning of the year have brought about domestic divisions and confrontations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zou Zhiqiang, a researcher at the Middle East Studies Center of Fudan University, told Southern Weekend reporters that the current political instability and internal strife in Israel are higher than in the past, which has distracted Israel&#39;s own attention and energy and weakened morale. Therefore, Israel was unprepared for Hamas&#39;s &quot;innovative, multi-channel&quot; blitz attack. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;Sea, land and air&quot; all-round attack&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&quot;Hamas members penetrate from three routes: land, sea and air.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt; p>;Israel Defense Forces spokesman Daniel Hagari said that since 6:30 a.m. local time on October 7, more than 2,200 rockets have been fired from the Gaza Strip towards Israel. At the same time, dozens of armed men stormed the wall, blasting away barricades with explosives and attacking in multiple locations with bulldozers, hang gliders and motorcycles. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zou Zhiqiang believes that from the perspective of an irregular armed organization, Hamas’s operation has an overwhelming advantage. It has caused such a large amount of damage and blow to the tightly defended Israel, which is quite serious from a military perspective. Noteworthy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Judging from the attack method, Hamas armed personnel infiltrated into Israel through multiple channels of sea, land and air. Israeli police stations, settlements and multiple military bases were attacked, and Israeli heavy weapons including main battle tanks and armored vehicles were seized. A large number of Israeli soldiers and ordinary Jewish settlers were captured. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the view of military expert Zhang Xuefeng, the key to Hamas&#39; rapid &quot;results&quot; lies first in the &quot;battle surprise&quot; achieved by Hamas&#39; armed forces. According to Western accounts, Hamas has developed a coordination and communication system that does not rely on electronic systems such as mobile phones, making it impossible for Israeli intelligence agencies to spy on it, while hiding its offensive intentions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, Hamas used drones and missiles to attack Israeli air defense systems and military bases. It also sent submarines and speedboats to penetrate and land on the Israeli coastline, breaking through Israel&#39;s coastal defenses. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Before the raid, Hamas was ready to pay the price.&quot; Zou Zhiqiang said that the armed men who rushed into Israel never thought about going back. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As more details emerge, the outside world increasingly believes that this operation was &quot;well prepared.&quot; A training video released by the &quot;Qassam Brigades&quot;, an armed wing of Hamas, shows that Hamas has long built a simulated Israeli stronghold in Gaza, where its members practice landings and raids. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, Reuters reported that since 2021, Israel has sought to maintain basic stability in the Gaza economy by providing incentives including thousands of licenses. Also in the past two years, Hamas has not taken military action against Israel, which has caused Israel to relax its vigilance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zou Zhiqiang believes that from the perspective of Israel’s long-term strength advantage and reliance on technical means, they may have become lax and have a tired mentality due to their past experience in responding to the Gaza conflict many times. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But in the long run, Zou Zhiqiang said that Hamas may not be able to get Israel to make concessions this time. On the contrary, Israel may intensify its &quot;retaliation.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Copy&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;&quot;The Yom Kippur War&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;? &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;This time Hamas launched a blitzkrieg against Israel on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the &quot;Yom Kippur War&quot; (the Fourth Middle East War). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;October 6 every year happens to be the Jewish &quot;Yom Kippur&quot;. Israel will have a national holiday on that day, suspending all normal activities. On the afternoon of October 6, 1973, Egypt launched an attack on Israel. The Egyptian army forced across the Suez Canal and broke through the Bar-Lev defense line. Israel was caught off guard and faced the danger of national subjugation. Of course, Israel eventually reversed the situation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many Western media have commented that the major mistakes made by Israel and the United States on the intelligence front are comparable to Israel&#39;s performance before the outbreak of the &quot;Yom Kippur War&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before the war, the Egyptian army repeatedly recruited and demobilized reservists, causing Israel to lose its alertness. Active-duty troops frequently moved forward and retreated to cover up military deployments. The war started on the &quot;Yom Kippur&quot; day, which coincided with the Jewish fast, which was not conducive to rapid mobilization. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“There is a certain comparability and a certain correlation between the two.” Zou Zhiqiang believes that Hamas chose the second day of Yom Kippur to carry out a surprise attack. The method of the raid was similar, and Israel was caught off guard. The reaction is quite similar. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many experts and scholars interviewed told Southern Weekend reporters that Hamas&#39;s attack was not only to commemorate the same &quot;secret&quot; operation 50 years ago, but also to take advantage of the fact that that day was Israel&#39;s &quot;Sabbath&quot; , attack him unprepared. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The New York Times believes that although more than half a century has passed since the large-scale war, villages have been occupied again and civilians have been killed or taken hostage, awakening people&#39;s &quot;primitive fears.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zou Zhiqiang said that because the Fourth Middle East War involved Egypt and Syria uniting to attack Israel, it was a large-scale frontal battle between countries. Now Hamas is implementing an asymmetric guerrilla war. The intensity of the battlefield and the confrontation between the two sides cannot be compared with the former. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;What is different from 50 years ago is that the Palestinian-Israeli issue has been marginalized now. This has caused a very disappointing and even desperate mood in Palestine.&quot; Li Weijian believes that under the mixture of various emotions, the Palestinians People hope to make an impactful action by themselves in an attempt to draw the international community&#39;s attention to the Palestinian-Israeli issue again. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;The multi-party game behind the conflict&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The conflict between Palestine and Israel has been going on for a long time. In 2020, the leaders of Israel, the United Arab Emirates, and Bahrain signed the Abraham Accords at the White House, agreeing to normalize bilateral relations and cooperate in economic, technology, security and other fields. The agreement is considered a historic breakthrough in the Middle East. However, countries such as Palestine, Iran, and Turkey oppose and criticize this. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Hamas has always opposed Arab countries to go beyond the Palestinian-Israeli issue and improve relations or establish diplomatic relations with Israel.&quot; Zou Zhiqiang analyzed that the traditional consensus among Arab countries is to resolve the Palestinian-Israeli issue first and then resolve the issue. Arab-Israeli question. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is widely speculated that Hamas is only a local armed force in the Palestinian Gaza area, and its military strength is very different from that of Israel. Will this &quot;go all out&quot; raid be supported by other countries? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Up to now, countries and organizations such as Iran, Lebanese Hezbollah, Qatar, Kuwait, Iraq, and Syria have publicly spoken out in support of Hamas. Most of these countries have considerable conflicts with Israel and the United States. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The American &quot;Time&quot; magazine believes that Iran has always been the largest single &quot;sponsor&quot; of Hamas. In addition to military training and humanitarian assistance, more than $100 million in military assistance is provided annually. After Hamas launched a raid on Israel, Iran set off fireworks in &quot;public celebration&quot; on the evening of October 7. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hamas spokesman Ghazi Hamad also said in an interview with the British Broadcasting Corporation on October 8 that the organization has received support from its ally Iran and help from &quot;other countries&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, on October 8, the Iranian mission to the United Nations stated in a statement, &quot;We firmly support Palestine. However, we will not participate in Palestine&#39;s actions because this is entirely Palestine&#39;s own decision.&quot; ”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are also many people who side with Israel. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As soon as the conflict broke out, the United States stated that it &quot;will stand with the Israeli people and government.&quot; The White House also specifically stated that the United States will &quot;continue to provide support to Israel, including in-depth intelligence exchanges.&quot; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the US &quot;Time&quot; magazine, the United States provides more than $3 billion in defense assistance to Israel every year, making it the largest recipient of aid, and &quot;it is conceivable that this number may increase.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For a long time, the Middle East has been one of the &quot;core areas&quot; for great power competition. Now that the situation between Palestine and Israel has escalated again, secret games between all parties are indispensable behind the scenes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zou Zhiqiang believes that the conflict will still be limited to Palestine and Israel. In the short term, the Palestinian-Israeli issue may return to the center stage of Middle East diplomacy, but in the long run, it will still be difficult to change its marginalized status. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Weijian believes that if Israel goes on a killing spree and retaliates wildly, causing a large number of deaths, it may intensify internal conflicts in the Middle East. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 9, the spokesperson of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs called for a ceasefire as soon as possible to protect civilians. At the same time, the international community should increase its sense of urgency, increase investment in the Palestinian issue, and make practical efforts to promote the &quot;two-state solution&quot; . &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(Southern Weekend interns Lin Xi and Bao Jingyue also contributed to this article)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p >;</description><pubDate> Wed, 11 Oct 2023 15:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[墙塌压坏菜园成最高法案例，民间调解呼唤“新乡贤”丨快评]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258381]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-11 14:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Recently, the Supreme People’s Court issued a number of typical cases for resolving post-disaster conflicts and disputes. In one of the cases, the courtyard wall of a family in Zhuozhou, Hebei Province collapsed during heavy rain, crushing the neighbor&#39;s vegetable garden. The two parties had a dispute and wanted to go to court. The judge conducted mediation before the lawsuit, and the conflict was finally resolved. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The wall of my yard collapsed and destroyed my neighbor’s vegetable garden. Apart from some vegetables, there was no other major loss. This is a small matter, and in many places, it is possible for the two families to resolve it privately, or to resolve the dispute under the auspices of the village mediator, without going to court. For example, in a village in southeastern Shandong Province, there is an old man in his sixties who is the most senior member of his clan. He is very prestigious because of his eloquence and impartiality. When conflicts and disputes arise between villagers, they are willing to come to him to administer justice. Many disputes were resolved through his mediation. As &quot;Southern Weekend&quot; reported some time ago, &quot;Mazu consultation rooms&quot; set up in many places in Putian, Fujian also played an important role in resolving civil disputes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This kind of mediation mechanism, presided over by local &quot;mediators&quot; and based on the endogenous ethical norms of local society, is one of the important channels for resolving civil disputes. Not long ago, the &quot;Implementation Plan for the &quot;My Hometown, I Build&quot; Activity jointly issued by the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, the National Development and Reform Commission, the Ministry of Civil Affairs, etc. proposed that a group of prestigious and fair-minded returnees should be hired as mediators of neighborhood conflicts to actively Explore working methods such as &quot;package resolution&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Traditionally, Chinese society is a rural society. Most civil disputes in rural areas are resolved through local mediation. Because of the disputes between villagers, most of them were trivial matters such as the Zhang family&#39;s cow eating a few seedlings from the Li family, or the Wang family&#39;s chicken pecking a few vegetables from the Liu family, and the interests involved were not very large. The countryside is made up of acquaintances and even people of the same clan, who have close relationships with each other. In the long-term relationship, a common set of behavioral norms has been formed, which has become the customary law of the village. Those who preside over the mediation are mostly local respected people, either clan leaders, elders, or local sages who have retired and returned to their hometowns. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Most of China&#39;s rural areas live together in groups. The villagers in many villages are descended from the same ancestors. Of course, there are also some villages where two or more surnames live together, or there are a few families with small surnames. But generally speaking, these villagers have lived together for generations and have developed a way of getting along with each other, and they also have people they believe in in common. Especially within a clan, the patriarch has high authority. When conflicts arise among villagers, most of them are willing to seek their help. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the face of various contradictions and disputes within the village, this kind of mediation is not only a referee, but also a process of reasoning and education. Fei Xiaotong once said in &quot;Rural China&quot;, &quot;Mediation is a new term, and the old term is judgment. The so-called mediation in the countryside is actually an educational process.&quot; Therefore, these mediations are often more likely to lead to conflicts than official referees. Most will be implemented voluntarily if all parties are convinced. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, with the rapid social changes and increased population mobility in recent years, the original acquaintance society in rural areas has also begun to become unfamiliar and atomized. It has become difficult to find a &quot;mediator&quot; who is universally convinced by the residents. In some rural areas, especially those on the outskirts of cities, many outsiders come to rent houses. These tenants have no historical connection with the village and are “outsiders” to the village. They often do not fully identify with the original authority in the village. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the other hand, the number of villagers moving out has also increased significantly. Many villagers are away from home all year round and seldom return to the village. The contact with other villagers gradually decreases, and the relationship between clan members and neighbors becomes weaker and weaker. In addition, their long-term experience in stranger societies in other places also makes them more sympathetic to the legal rules of stranger societies, rather than the traditional rules of the countryside and the traditional authority under rural rules. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The defamiliarization and atomization of these two aspects have reduced the prestige of the original authority in rural society, and the function of determining divisions and ending disputes has been continuously weakened. There is no traditional authority that both foreign tenants and local villagers believe in. Villagers who have been away from home for a long time are increasingly less convinced by the elders in the village. As a result, when conflicts arise between foreign tenants and indigenous people, or even disputes among villagers, they are less willing to apply the previous local rules, and are more willing to turn to institutional authorities such as the government and courts for solutions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To rebuild the traditional civil mediation mechanism, it is necessary to find a new &quot;mediator&quot; with sufficient prestige in the community. &quot;Xinxiangxian&quot; is a possible option. Letting these &quot;new rural sages&quot; come forward to uphold justice can often resolve disputes. Compared with the formal judicial process, the social cost is lower. Their mediation is also more likely to be recognized by all parties to the conflict, and the mediation plan is easy to implement. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Even trivial disputes in rural areas are turned to the courts. This can indeed be said to be a &quot;modernization&quot; of the rule of law, but at the same time it dissolves tradition and makes the judicial system unburdened. To give full play to the role of civil mediation in settling disputes and resolving minor conflicts on the spot, it is necessary to rebuild the cohesion of the community and find &quot;Xinxiang wise men&quot; who are familiar and convinced by residents and have considerable modern legal knowledge to act as &quot;mediators.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 11 Oct 2023 14:25:05 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
