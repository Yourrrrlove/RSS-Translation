The style of writing is so sentimental! Yang Yi&#39;s calm narrative moved me very much while reading it. As for why Balao&#39;s novel was so popular back then, it may be that there were many young people from big families who had the same experience as the protagonist in &quot;Family&quot;, and they were particularly easy to relate to. We must use realistic memoirs to understand the true state of people&#39;s lives at that time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/06/274efc1f45.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;1573&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/06/274efc1f45.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;260841&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p >;&lt;strong>;&quot;Collection of Explorations of Recent People and Recent Events&quot;, Chen Xiaoping, Nanjing University Press, August 2022&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A textual research collection of modern history, the author is good at using archival document analysis , and field surveys to examine historical facts that were ignored or misunderstood in the past. His historical knowledge also has a strong flavor of the South China School, which pays special attention to the local perspective, thus correcting the one-dimensional perspective in the past. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/06/4d0849a53f.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;1531&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/06/4d0849a53f.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;260842&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p >;&lt;strong>;&quot;The Great Rebellion: Group Portraits of Death and Life&quot;, [Japan] written by Nobuho Tanaka, translated by Zang Zhijun, Shanghai Translation Publishing House, November 2023&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This book contains It tells the historical tracing of the &quot;Great Rebellion&quot; in the Meiji era and the story of the parties and their relatives striving to redress the injustice. In the long history, unjust cases of individuals and even groups are insignificant, and many people will not live to see the day when history reverses the verdict! So what is the meaning of history itself? One cannot help but ask the same question as Shi Qian: &quot;What if the so-called way of heaven is evil or not?&quot; What is touching is that although ninety years have passed and the parties involved are no longer alive, there are still people working hard to restore the historical truth. This effort It seems insignificant in the face of power, but it is a flickering light that illuminates the long and dark historical process. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/06/24d95e6214.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;1539&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/06/24d95e6214.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;260843&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p >;&lt;strong>;&quot;Critical Biography of Lu Zhengxiang&quot;, written by Tang Qihua, Social Science Literature Press, April 2023&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Based on a large number of surveys of archives at home and abroad, this book re-draws the story of the late Qing Dynasty The life of Lu Zhengxiang, the first generation of professional diplomat in the early Republic of China, also clarified many false accusations against him. It was said that a weak country had no diplomacy. It was indeed not easy to achieve some achievements in diplomacy in the early Republic of China. Most of the diplomats of that generation came from poor families. After graduating from translation schools, they were immediately sent overseas to serve as translators in embassies and consulates. After going abroad, Lu Zhengxiang studied diplomacy with the enlightened diplomat Xu Jingcheng. Xu was later executed for opposing Empress Dowager Cixi&#39;s declaration of war on the eight countries. Lu Zhengxiang himself is extremely Westernized. Not only did he learn Western languages, customs, and systems from an early age, he even married a Belgian woman who was 16 years older than him, despite everyone&#39;s opposition. The research on Lu&#39;s situation in his later years is also a highlight of this book. In his later years, Lu Zhengxiang went to Europe to treat his wife&#39;s illness and served as the Swiss minister. However, he was caught up in the troubled times in Beiyang and owed the embassy wages and fees for more than two years. As a result, after his wife died, he had no way to support him. He became more committed to Catholicism, and by chance, he stayed in a monastery. He became a monk and became a priest, completely completing the Westernization of his life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/06/19015edeeb.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;1485&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/06/19015edeeb.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;260844&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p >;&lt;strong>;&quot;As if I were here in person: Imperial Portrait Worship and Political Life in the Song Dynasty&quot;, written by Huang Bo, Shanxi People&#39;s Publishing House, January 2023&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A good topic selection is equivalent to a successful project Halfway through, Huang Bo used his spare time from research to write this popular book on the history of the Song Dynasty. He took a unique approach and analyzed the political life of the Song Dynasty from the perspective of the worship of portraits of emperors in the Song Dynasty. He skillfully used historical materials and used popular and humorous language to examine the people of the Song Dynasty in the pre-nation-state era. How to use imperial portraits to create a national (sovereignty) image takes into account both academic innovation and the readability of the work. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/06/d420660ca1.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;1573&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/06/d420660ca1.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;260845&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p >;&lt;strong>;&quot;Galicia: History and Imagination in Habsburg Political Culture&quot;, [American] written by Larry Wolfe, translated by Zheng Xinhe, Social Science Literature Press, January 2023&lt;/strong>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This book traces the history of a country that has passed away but still lives in people&#39;s memory. Although Galicia was an Eastern European provincial administrative region created by the Habsburg dynasty in the 18th century, the Habsburgs used the spirit of Enlightenment to reconstruct this multi-ethnic and multi-religious region, striving to create a diverse It is a dynastic autonomous territory with cultural and multi-ethnic coexistence, and has promoted the process of regional autonomy following wave after wave of revolutionary waves. However, all this came to an end with the collapse of the Habsburg dynasty in World War I. After that, Galicia had an ill-fated fate and experienced periods such as its return to Poland and Soviet occupation. However, an imaginary Galician country The construction of memory has been passed down into the 21st century, and returned to people&#39;s vision after Ukraine&#39;s independence, recalling Galicia as a fantasy paradise. Wolfe uses a large number of historical documents and even descriptions from many contemporary literary works to make this book have the rigor of historical research and the tension of literary imagination, triggering our thinking about the monster of the modern nation-state and what it is. The identity of the nation-state? Why does this concept bring hatred and division between groups in practice? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/06/24f8486513.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;1548&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/06/24f8486513.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;260846&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p >;&lt;strong>;&quot;Learning to &quot;Quarrel&quot; with Chizuru Ueno at Tokyo University&quot;, [Japanese] Haruka Yoko, translated by Lu Lingzhi, Beijing United Publishing Company, March 2023&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This The book is a record of a female variety show talk show artist studying with Chizuru Ueno. The writing is interesting and vivid, full of liveness and presence, and also shows the thinking process. It is interesting and profound, and it can stimulate the spark of thought. This book: &quot;Why do you need to read a lot of documents to study? Because a vacuum of information will not produce originality.&quot; &quot;What should you do if you can&#39;t remember the documents? Then try to forget it! What you can remember in the end is really valuable.&quot; Even more exciting I was surprised that this book was published in Japan over twenty years ago!

Today&#39;s calligraphy and painting circles still follow this tradition. This book originated from an elegant gathering at Tsinghua Garden Shengyinyuan in the autumn of 2015. The young scholar Gu Qing &quot;wrote the elegant collection because of the elegant gathering&quot; and left this research work of the elegant gathering as a commemoration of the elegant gathering. It is also a good story in the contemporary art world. What is even more rare is that in the book, Gu Qing systematically analyzes the characteristics of paintings related to elegant gatherings in Song Dynasty paintings, revealing the internal and external relationships, memorial concepts, model circulation, political affairs and leisure, &quot;portraits&quot; and &quot;records&quot; of elegant gatherings. The five distinctive features such as &quot;prosperity&quot; illustrate the profound connotation and the characteristics of the spread and evolution of Yaji Tu. It also puts forward many new insights, which are refreshing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/06/157d87ab46.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;1455&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/06/157d87ab46.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;260848&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p >;&lt;strong>;&quot;Modern Dream II: Designing Daily Life in Twentieth-Century Japan&quot;, [Japanese] Naojingwang, translated by Luo Yuan and Cai Huiying, Social Science Literature Press, November 2023&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Takehisa Yumeji&#39;s life is full of legends, but this book is a pure art commentary and does not involve any gossip about Yumeji&#39;s private life. The book comprehensively analyzes Yumeji&#39;s achievements as a popular illustrator and graphic artist in the Taisho era. It also shows Yumeji&#39;s unique artistic connotation based on different historical stages, from the Meiji socialist trend of thought, the Great Rebellion to the Great Kanto Earthquake. , the close relationship between skills and times. The author points out that Yumeji&#39;s creations not only embody the image of Japanese women in the &quot;Yumeji style&quot; and &quot;mono-sorrow&quot;, but also represent the trendy and fashionable aspects of consumerist culture guided by the mass media. There is also a sympathy for the weak that runs through Yumeji&#39;s life. and strong anti-war ideas. The appendix contains the complete newspaper series &quot;Tokyo Disaster Illustrated Letters&quot; created by Yumeji during the Great Kanto Earthquake, which is of great appreciation value. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/06/e13aaa2da5.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;1546&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/06/e13aaa2da5.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;260849&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p >;&lt;strong>;&quot;The Key to Power: A History of World Taxation&quot;, [English] written by Dominic Frisby, translated by Liu Shengxiao, Zhejiang People&#39;s Publishing House, October 2022&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is An introductory popular book, the author believes that the history of mankind&#39;s struggle for freedom is a history of resistance to taxation. Fiscal reform shaped modern society and enabled Britain to take the lead in entering the ranks of modern countries. The second half of the book has a future outlook. It is believed that the development of Internet finance, the rise of digital nomads, and the prevalence of cryptocurrency will make it increasingly difficult for the country to collect taxes, and the maximization of digital nomads will make the nation-state model Bankruptcy. However, the battle between collection and counter-collection will continue, and technological means will enhance the ability to collect taxes in ways that invade privacy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(The author is a scholar of literature and history)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 06 Dec 2023 22:25:05 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[五月天平均每周都有演唱会，背后公司是什么来路？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/262002]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-12-06 21:17:59&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;Mayday &quot;I really want to see you in concert&quot;.

Image source: Believe Music official Weibo. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In December 2023, the pop rock band &quot;Mayday&quot;, which has been in the industry for 26 years, was involved in a lip-synching controversy at a concert. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The blogger &quot;Wheatfield Farmer&quot; compared the vocals and song track lines at Mayday&#39;s Shanghai concert, and pointed out that 5 of the 12 songs performed by Mayday were lip-syncing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On December 4, Mayday’s management company Believe Music responded: There is no lip-synching and a statement will be issued. The concert audio has been submitted to the inspection department, and the relevant departments will conduct scientific evaluation and analysis and publish the investigation results. As of press time, there is no clear result on whether it was &quot;lip-syncing&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ding Dang, Liu Ruoying and other artists affiliated with Believe Music all expressed their voices for Mayday on Weibo. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On Zhihu, some Mayday fans mentioned that lip-synching is not new this year, it was discovered in 2019. Mayday lead singer Ashin (Chen Xinhong) also took a blockade injection for a performance, which caused many fans to feel &quot;heartbroken&quot; and repeatedly called on them to hold less concerts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2023, 48-year-old Ashin said at a concert in Chengdu, &quot;Some people say that music treats Mayday as a cash cow. If Mayday doesn&#39;t want to sing, no one can force us. If Monster, Martha, Shitou, Guanyou, and Ashin want to sing, and no one can stop us.&quot; Today, the five members are all between 46 and 50 years old. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;From 20 shows a year to 60 shows a year&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Mayday can be said to be an indelible imprint of youth in the hearts of a generation, and this sentiment has become the driving force behind its concert box office market. Appeal. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2023, Mayday held 6 concerts with 40,000 people at the Beijing Bird&#39;s Nest with the dual themes of &quot;I Want to See You So Much&quot; and &quot;Noah&#39;s Ark 10th Anniversary Evolution Reissue Limited Edition&quot;; Guangzhou Olympic Stadium There were 5 concerts, attracting 175,000 people; 8 concerts in Shanghai, the total audience exceeded 360,000. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In other words, Mayday held 19 concerts in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou this year, with an audience of about 700,000. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tickets for the Shanghai concert ranged from 355 yuan to 1,855 yuan each. They were sold out as soon as they opened, and many fans said it was hard to get a ticket. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The fans who went to the concert wore Mayday’s exclusive logo, waved blue fluorescent sticks in their hands, and some wore black Mayday peripheral shirts. Fans can purchase peripherals online in advance or at the concert. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Take light sticks as an example. A cloud-based interactive light stick costs 140 yuan, the light stick protective cover webbing is 50 yuan, and the light stick sticker is 40 yuan. During a concert, there were as many as 19 types of Mayday peripheral products, with prices ranging from 40 yuan to 1,050 yuan. If fans want to collect all peripheral products, they will need to spend a total of 5,244 yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Based on the number of viewers of the 8 concerts in Shanghai, the revenue from tickets and peripheral products (only counting the price of a single light stick) was at least 178 million yuan, that is, the average revenue per game started at 20 million yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Why should one city do multiple shows? The more tours there are at a single stop, the cost of clothing, video production, stage construction, etc. will also be diluted, and the profit margin will be larger. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to statistics from Southern Weekend reporters, in 2023, Mayday’s dual-theme switching tour will have a total of 68 performances, covering 21 cities, including 12 mainland cities. Among the singers who held concerts this year, Mayday ranked second in terms of number of concerts, with 40-year-old Joker Xue occupying the first place with 104 official concerts. Joker Xue once canceled a concert in Chengdu due to a sudden high fever that caused tonsil discomfort. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;68 concerts a year, which is equivalent to a frequency of five or six concerts per month. On average, it can be said that there are concerts every week. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Mayday’s role as a “model worker” in concerts did not start this year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From 2004 to 2006, Mayday held the &quot;Final Home When We Mix Together&quot; world tour concert, which traveled to 11 cities around the world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The then deputy general manager of Believe Music (Beijing) Li Yixun once told the media that they held two rounds of Mayday tours with different themes from 2007 to 2008, with a total of 23 performances and attracting more than 300,000 people. Watch. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2017 marks the 20th anniversary of the founding of Mayday. The youngest member among them is already forty years old, but they are more diligent than when they were young, singing almost from the beginning to the end of the year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;LIFE Life Unlimited Company&quot; theme concert was launched in March 2017 and lasted until January 2019, with a total of 122 concerts, an average of nearly 60 concerts per year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After only three months of rest, Mayday went to Osaka, Japan in April 2019 to hold a new theme concert &quot;Just Rock It!!! BLUE&quot;. They held 28 concerts in Osaka, Hong Kong, Beijing, Shanghai, and Taoyuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The new crown epidemic has forced the non-stop Mayday to stop. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In May 2020, in order to stick to the &quot;May Agreement&quot; with music fans, Mayday teamed up with Tencent TME to hold an online concert, which was watched by more than 35 million fans online. On the last day of 2020, Mayday launched a concert with the theme &quot;I Really Want to See You&quot; and performed six consecutive shows in Taoyuan, Taiwan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2021, the world is still affected by the epidemic. This year, Mayday held 14 concerts in Taoyuan, Tainan and Kaohsiung, Taiwan. In 2022, they will also tour Las Vegas, New York, and Singapore. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the end of 2022, another new-themed &quot;Noah&#39;s Ark 10th Anniversary Evolution Reproduction Limited Edition Concert&quot; will start in Taoyuan. At the same time, the &quot;I Really Want to See You&quot; concert is also going on. This theme spans four continents, with a total of 78 performances. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It can be said that after Mayday joined Believe Music, releasing records was no longer the main development path, and concerts became its main job. Concerts are held with different themes almost every year, and there are even two themed concerts in the same year, and the number of concerts has expanded from more than 20 a year to more than 60 a year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past five years, except for the two years affected by the epidemic, there have been more than 60 games every year, and this year it is close to 70 games. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The actual controller of Believe Music was once Mayday’s manager&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Believe Music was founded with the intention of adopting a different business model from traditional record distribution. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The profit logic of the traditional record era relies on the production and distribution of records. The better the record sells and the greater the distribution, the higher the profit. Royalties are distributed between record companies and creators. What major record stores compete for is the volume of releases. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The emergence of pirated optical discs has destroyed the original mature business logic. Coupled with the impact of digital music and online downloads, the record industry has plummeted. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2006, Believe Music founders Chen Yongzhi and Xie Zhifen recruited Mayday and Rene Liu to form a new company. Chen Yongzhi was the chief strategy officer of Rolling Stone Group at the time, and Xie Zhifen was Mayday&#39;s manager. The two established Believe Music International Co., Ltd. (referred to as Believe Music) in Taipei. According to Qichacha, the chairman is Chen Yongzhi, Wu Jieying and Xie Peiling are directors, and Hong Huizhen is the supervisor. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Rolling Stone Records is a local record company in Taiwan. Li Zongsheng, Luo Dayou, Liu Rene, Zhou Huajian, Tao Zhe, Liang Jingru, Mayday, etc. are all from Rolling Stone. At present, among the artists who believe in music are old Rolling Stones, such as Li Zongsheng, Rene Liu, and Su Huilun. For a certain period of time, Rolling Stone still played the role of a trusted music record publisher. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Chen Yongzhi’s intention to form a new company is also obvious. The industry’s original “record sales” model is no longer viable, and a new business model needs to be found. Looking at it today, the new model can be said to be the &quot;fan economy&quot;, with concerts, celebrity peripherals, and audio-visual product publishing as the main sources of income. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2007, Believe Music Culture Media (Beijing) Co., Ltd. was established. The actual controller is Xie Zhifen, accounting for 92.5% of the shares, and Chen Yongzhi 7.5%. This company is responsible for the music works managed by Believe Music in China. Matters related to the mainland area. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I believe that during the music period, Mayday did not put too much energy into record production, and usually only released new albums in three to five years. Especially after 2012, Mayday mostly released adapted versions of concert selections or singles, and the focus of their work every year was on tours. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Believe in Music even set up a department specifically for Mayday and Liang Jingru to serve concerts. The head of the department, Zhou Youyang, was called a &quot;foreign man&quot; by Mayday members. This department first became famous for planning the &quot;Left the Surface of the Earth&quot; concert in Mayday. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to reports from Taiwan Juheng.com, Mayday accounts for 70% of Believe Music’s annual revenue. Once Mayday does not have a film or concert that year, the revenue of Believe Music will fluctuate too much. This is also the case for Believe Music. The reason why music has never been released on the market. Taiwan Juheng.com is a professional financial website in Taiwan. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;Mayday Concept Stock&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In 2014, with the support of Believe Music, &quot;Foreign Man&quot; led the Believe Music concert production department and integrated four behind-the-scenes production companies in the industry to establish a separate company The company, called Bing Creates. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The official website of Bing Creation shows that the top three shareholders are Xiangzhi Co., Ltd., Rolling Stone Mobile Co., Ltd., and Believe Music International Co., Ltd., accounting for 12.25%, 8.65%, and 7.59% respectively. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xiangzhi Co., Ltd. was funded and established by Believe Music, and the actual controller is Chen Yongzhi. Based on this calculation, I believe Music holds a total of 19.84% of Bing’s shares, making it the largest shareholder. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2018, Bing Creation (6625-TW) was listed in Taiwan and was called a &quot;Mayday concept stock&quot; by investors. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The 2022 financial report shows that Bing generated revenue of NT$1.088 billion. After deducting costs and expenses, the net operating profit was NT$24.91 million, and the net operating profit rate was 2%. In non-epidemic years, the operating net profit margin is approximately between 4% and 8%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the first half of 2023, the operating net profit margin will rebound to 8%. Generally speaking, the peak season for concert activities is in the second half of the year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The main revenue generated by Bing is equipment rental, performance or event production design and hardware engineering, exhibition tickets, and sales of peripheral products for exhibitions and activities.

Mi Feng, spokesperson of the National Health Commission, said that at present, the National Health Commission, together with the State Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine and the State Administration of Disease Control and Prevention, continue to carry out winter respiratory disease monitoring and research and judgment, and are doing a good job in allocating medical resources, optimizing the medical treatment process, and playing a central role. Medical functions and other work are deployed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to monitoring, the currently prevalent acute respiratory diseases are all caused by known pathogens and have corresponding mature treatments. No new infectious diseases caused by new viruses or bacteria have been found. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The superimposed and high incidence of multiple pathogens makes this wave of respiratory disease infections another major test for the medical system after the COVID-19 epidemic. In addition to continuing to implement and improve the hierarchical diagnosis and treatment system and improving the general awareness of primary medical and health institutions, The old problem of long-term shortage of pediatric medical resources, including infection diagnosis and treatment capabilities and severe illness identification and referral efficiency, has once again attracted widespread attention. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On December 4, the General Office of the National Health Commission issued the &quot;Notice on Guiding Primary Medical and Health Institutions to Provide Health Services for Respiratory Diseases in Winter and Spring&quot;, which proposed requirements for pediatric diagnosis and treatment services in primary medical and health institutions. Multiple requirements: Primary medical and health institutions in various places must be fully open to children and must not refuse treatment; general hospitals should strengthen support for primary medical and health institutions; each primary medical and health institution should have at least one general practitioner to complete the diagnosis and treatment of pediatric diseases. For work training, at least two nurses must complete pediatric treatment training to speed up the improvement of grassroots capabilities in carrying out pediatric and respiratory disease diagnosis and treatment in winter and spring. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/06/7vnmI7YsuZVNfWIQF54VZRvqXibOtPiBWFsieCgq.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/06/7vnmI7YsuZVNfWIQF54VZRvqXibOtPiBWFsieCgq.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;260895&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On November 29, 2023, in Shanghai, many children patients were still queuing up for treatment in the emergency department at Children&#39;s Hospital at night&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/ Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;Immune gap&quot;? &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In November, the pediatric clinics of various hospitals in Beijing have been full. The waiting time for outpatient and emergency services at Daxing Hospital and Friendship Hospital even reached more than 24 hours. The emergency infusion center of Beijing Children’s Hospital received nearly 2,000 calls. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Dai Jia, a pediatrician at a comprehensive university hospital in Beijing, sees more than 120 patients every day. Even for night emergencies, the number of outpatient and emergency visits is two or three times that of 2019. Due to the large number of patients being treated, the department will rotate a doctor on duty in the ward to support the outpatient department every day. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Beyond Beijing, the pediatric wards of hospitals in Tianjin, Liaoning, Shanghai, Guangdong and other places are also operating at full capacity. The average daily emergency department attendance at the Panyu Campus of Guangdong Maternal and Child Health Hospital has reached more than 800, exceeding the spring flu peak in Guangzhou in March 2023. The outpatient and emergency departments of Sun Yat-sen University Affiliated Hospital are fully booked, and it is common to wait in line for several hours. Dozens of inpatient beds have also been reserved, waiting to be freed up to treat children with pneumonia. But in general, hospitals in Guangzhou are much more relaxed than Beijing. At least in the waiting hall, everyone has a seat and an infusion pole. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When influenza is prone to occur every spring and winter, there will be a peak period for consultations in pediatric clinics, but this year’s round of respiratory tract infections lasts particularly long. An Yang, a pediatric resident at a tertiary hospital in Guangzhou, has been working intensively for several months. “Since August and September, drug-resistant mycoplasma infections have been present, and they have eased for a while, but B and A have started again. , and may overlap, and the symptoms will be more severe.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The ward managed by Anyang is in a saturated state all year round. If a child who needs hospitalization is found, the outpatient and emergency doctors will first ask if there are any children in the ward. There are no beds. If they cannot be vacated temporarily, the doctor will provide emergency infusion and symptomatic treatment. At the same time, it is recommended to consult other hospitals for bed inpatient treatment. In fact, most children who come to the outpatient and emergency department have mild symptoms assessed by doctors and can be treated with oral medications and observe the effects. For children with more severe conditions, intravenous administration may be considered. Anyang and colleagues found that one of the characteristics of this round of Mycoplasma pneumoniae is the high rate of drug resistance. &quot;Azithromycin, commonly used in pediatric treatment, is not effective orally, and the intravenous effect is not as good as before.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot; Azithromycin is still used in pediatrics. Azithromycin has been used in pediatrics for a long time, and there is a lot of experience in clinical observation of drug effects and adverse reactions. If quinolones and tetracyclines are abused, the gains may outweigh the losses.&quot; Anyang said, the 2023 edition of &quot;Children&#39;s Guide&quot; issued by the National Health Commission In the &quot;Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Mycoplasma Pneumonia&quot; (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: italics, italics_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;hereinafter referred to as the &quot;Guidelines&quot;&lt;/span>;), in addition to the macrolide antibiotics represented by azithromycin, New tetracyclines and quinolones have also been recommended, but their side effects have been repeatedly emphasized: new tetracyclines may affect enamel development and cause yellowing of teeth, and are not recommended for children under 8 years old; quinolones may affect cartilage development and increase tendons. Risk of breakage, not recommended for use by children under 18 years of age. &quot;Nowadays, partial drug resistance gene testing of Mycoplasma pneumoniae can be done, and the results can be obtained quickly. However, azithromycin is generally used to observe the efficacy first. If clinical drug resistance is found, the drug resistance gene test will be used to determine whether to use other antibiotics for treatment.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Computational biologists at University College London said in a statement to the UK&#39;s Science Media Center that lockdown measures implemented to slow the spread of the new coronavirus have prevented the spread of seasonal pathogens and reduced people&#39;s ability to build immunity to these microorganisms. opportunity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The World Health Organization (WHO) mentioned a similar statement - the new crown epidemic may have caused an immunity gap (immunity gap). During the epidemic, the spread of other viruses and bacteria decreased sharply, which may cause some children to Lack of immune defense against influenza, respiratory syncytial virus and other viruses that cause colds. An immune gap is a deficiency in protective immunity caused by chronic low exposure to a specific pathogen, leaving a greater proportion of the population susceptible to the disease. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The above statement is still controversial, and Anyang is not convinced. He believes that this is related to the popular microorganism itself. There will be a pandemic year every few years. &quot;Maybe this year&#39;s mycoplasma is special.&quot; What he feels is special is that mycoplasma pneumonia is prone to occur in children aged 5 to 14 years old, but this year people of all ages are infected. He was also suspected of being infected before. He coughed continuously for two or three weeks and took medicine by himself for a week. , using an atomizer. He didn&#39;t have a diagnosis because he didn&#39;t have time to get tested. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/06/6q2cRNAHhyMqD2lD8A9CZVYx7gDgjYd1sTxmDwfq.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;694&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/06/6q2cRNAHhyMqD2lD8A9CZVYx7gDgjYd1sTxmDwfq.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;260903&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On November 29, 2023, Children&#39;s Hospital Affiliated to Capital Institute of Pediatrics, children and their families waiting outside the clinic&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(South People Weekly reporter Liang Chen/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;Big hospital superstition&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Ideally, tertiary hospitals should not be the first choice for pneumonia patients. &quot;Go to the community first.&quot; Hospitals provide oral antibiotics. Some people will recover gradually, but some people will not recover. Then they go to a large hospital and undergo outpatient treatment, and then screen out the severe patients.&quot; However, hierarchical diagnosis and treatment in pediatrics is generally more difficult, and An Yang has almost never seen patients who take antibiotics. Patients who come to see a doctor based on their community hospital visit records. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Actually, as long as you follow the guidelines, the medication is almost the same. It depends on whether they can judge the serious condition in time.&quot; As long as the judgment of the serious condition is not delayed, Anyang feels that the treatment in community hospitals is not much different from that in tertiary hospitals. &quot;Severe symptoms are more obvious, such as low blood pressure, shortness of breath, and obvious white lesions on the chest X-ray.&quot; The severe rate of Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection is relatively low. In the Third Affiliated Hospital of Zhongshan Hospital, which is densely populated, patients are transferred to the ICU every day (&lt;span style There are 1 to 2 critically ill patients in the Intensive Care Unit&lt;/span>;). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Part of the &quot;big hospital superstition&quot; in pediatrics stems from the reality. Pediatrics are highly dependent on clinical experience, and their diagnosis ideas are very different from those of adults. Parents will trust hospitals with greater patient volume; secondly, large hospitals The medical resources in China are more abundant, but some grassroots hospitals have limited conditions. There are no night clinics, no tests, and no X-rays. &quot;For more complex diseases, the local second-level hospitals will directly recommend them to us.&quot; Anyang said that over time, many people will skip the first- and second-level hospitals and go straight to the third-level hospitals. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhu Xiaochun, chief physician of the neonatal surgery department of the Panyu Campus of Guangdong Maternal and Child Health Hospital, believes that parents’ emphasis on their children is also the reason why they choose large hospitals. Not long ago, a friend of Zhu Xiaochun&#39;s child had a high fever. He had already seen the best pediatrician in the local county hospital and called Zhu Xiaochun to consult about his condition. He was still worried and had to drive hundreds of kilometers to the Provincial Maternal and Child Health Care Center. See a doctor in the hospital. I spent thousands of dollars on metagenomic testing of pathogenic microorganisms (mNGS) and found out that I was infected with a rare mycoplasma. “It actually doesn’t mean much, it’s still a mycoplasma infection. After becoming resistant to azithromycin, I switched to tetracycline and my fever went away.” Some.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Subsequently, a friend suggested that &quot;the child&#39;s mental state is not good&quot; and he saw the respiratory department and neurology department. The neurologist suggested that he stop taking the medicine for a few days and then consider whether to do anything based on his mental state. lumbar puncture. After my friend stopped taking the medicine for three days, he took his child to Chimelong Paradise and told Zhu Xiaochun that &quot;the child is fine.&quot; Zhu Xiaochun summed it up: &quot;Many times it is the parents&#39; nervousness that causes doctors to passively over-treat. If the doctor doesn&#39;t do this, the parents will blame you.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Gao Jie, a pediatric respiratory doctor, encountered Many parents ask for blood tests as soon as they arrive. She opposes excessive testing. If the patient&#39;s symptoms are very typical, she will directly provide empirical treatment to save time. But she also understands the parent&#39;s appeal, &quot;He will feel that he has been queuing for 8 hours and needs to get checked. If he doesn&#39;t do it, he will go back. Queuing for such a long time is a sunk cost. If it were me, I would get a test As a result, I feel confident.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;An Yang found that the biggest feature of this round of Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection is that &quot;parents are generally anxious&quot;, &quot;I was very anxious before hospitalization, and rushed to be discharged after staying for two days. After a slight improvement, they are asking when they will be discharged from the hospital. The children have to go to school. They have missed classes and mid-term exams. Especially for children who have just entered elementary school or the first grade of junior high school, parents are particularly worried about the long absence from school. If you can’t keep up, it will be difficult to integrate into the class.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the guidelines, the treatment course for pneumonia is 7 to 14 days, but even children who are hospitalized with severe symptoms will not be able to stay for a full course of treatment due to the shortage of hospital beds. . But this does not mean that children can go to school. &quot;In the later stages of (respiratory tract infections) diseases, the airways will be in a more sensitive stage and are easily infected by other bacteria and viruses again.&quot; Regarding this round of infection peak, Anyang In addition to public health common sense such as washing hands frequently and wearing masks, the advice also includes &quot;don&#39;t be so anxious to go to school.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/06/0LLECBPfqAVrF3oHxhPdqAFg7vxfhYzrpbcdadqa.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/06/0LLECBPfqAVrF3oHxhPdqAFg7vxfhYzrpbcdadqa.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;260901&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Guangdong Maternal and Child Health Hospital Panyu Campus, children using atomizers&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern People Weekly reporter Nie Yangxin/picture )&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;It is normal for pediatricians to be busy&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The continuation of this wave of infections has put direct pressure on pediatricians on duty in outpatient and emergency departments, but for those who have just worked for three years and are still serving as For An Yang, a resident physician, the impact is not big. &quot;The pediatric wards of tertiary hospitals are generally in full working conditions. There are no (empty) beds at any time. Either this disease or that disease, there is always one to be admitted.&quot; .&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Anyang chose pediatrics for a very practical reason, &quot;My score in the postgraduate entrance examination is not high, so I have to find a major with good employment first.&quot; The shortage of pediatricians is normal, both in large hospitals and primary hospitals. The &quot;2015 China Health Statistics Yearbook&quot; shows that since 2010, the total number of pediatricians in China has dropped from 105,000 to 100,000, with an average of only 0.43 pediatricians per 1,000 children, which is equivalent to the national average of 2.06 physicians per 1,000 people. They are far apart, so the conditions for admissions and employment in pediatrics are more relaxed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the comprehensive appeal of pediatrics is still not strong. It was not until after working that An Yang deeply understood why his brothers and sisters advised everyone not to study pediatrics. For new doctors, there are too many things to learn and memorize in pediatrics. Other doctors only need to be proficient in part of the content, while pediatrics requires further subdivisions. Moreover, children of different ages have different levels of organ growth and development and different physiological characteristics, which leads to poor diagnosis. The indicators and dosages are different. &quot;Many drugs do not have clear dosages for children, and most of them are still used empirically.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Anyang also needs to learn how to coax children from scratch, &quot;In the beginning, talk to children When interacting with others, it was difficult to behave in a childish way, but it gradually got better. Some children prefer funny voices, so you have to explain the problem to them in a child&#39;s tone.&quot; For children who really can&#39;t listen, you can only When he was crying, An Yang saw a doctor. Now his tolerance for crying has been greatly improved. &quot;I don&#39;t feel it if you make a fuss next to me.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sometimes the patient&#39;s cooperation will be poor. Directly affects diagnosis and treatment. Anyang would secretly perform liver and spleen palpation while the children were asleep, because when they cried, the entire abdominal wall was hard and &quot;impossible to touch.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Children will be given sedatives before doing some more complex examinations, but the examining doctor is unwilling to bear the risk of medication, so Anyang needs to accompany the child with sedatives for examinations - queuing, examination, It takes a lot of time to wait for the results, and there are other children&#39;s problems in the ward that need to be dealt with, so the working hours are extended indefinitely. Anyang only has half a day to one day off every week. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the pediatric department where Anyang works, according to the division of work responsibilities, an attending doctor only works with 1-2 resident doctors and has to manage more than a dozen beds. The shortage of staff is obvious, but the hospital has no plans to recruit people and relies entirely on the support of &quot;regular trainees&quot; - medical graduates with a bachelor&#39;s degree or above who are new to medical positions must undergo three years of standardized residency training. The low income of graduates during the training period is the main way for hospitals to alleviate staff shortages at low cost. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although he has not been working for a long time, Anyang has clearly understood that pediatrics cannot bring higher economic benefits to the hospital. &quot;The hospital also has to consider revenue and expenditure, so what incentive does it have to recruit pediatricians?&quot;&lt;/p>; p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/06/XUPRhTDWswffE5pT7YKoHNCSTRRDC2aFVXkulRBE.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640 &quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/06/XUPRhTDWswffE5pT7YKoHNCSTRRDC2aFVXkulRBE.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;260902&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: # 999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Parents and children waiting to be called in the emergency waiting room at the Panyu Campus of Guangdong Maternal and Child Health Hospital&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern People Weekly reporter Nie Yangxin/ Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;If you can choose, how to choose?&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&quot;Doctors are trained and hard-working.&quot; Zhu Xiaochun has been in Guangdong Maternal and Child Health Hospital Although he is the chief physician, he is still very busy. On the afternoon of the afternoon when he was interviewed by Southern People Weekly, he read all the patients who came to register, but the interview was still interrupted by patients who wanted to add more patients. A parent took his child to the imaging department after 4 p.m. The imaging department was already doing the finishing work, and the nurse asked him to do the examination again tomorrow. After Zhu Xiaochun heard about it, he called the imaging department to coordinate, &quot;The patient is from out of town. It is not easy to come here. It is a big help if he can help.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Usually there are 36 patients in a half-day consultation. Zhu Xiaochun could add up to 45 numbers at most. &quot;If you can see it, let others see it.&quot; The registration system was closed at 11:45 in the morning, but he continued to add numbers until 13:30. Patients who could not be registered were not counted. workload. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Pediatrics is a &quot;dumb department&quot;. Children cannot accurately describe their physiological conditions, which makes pediatric diagnosis more difficult. Doctors must be experienced and patient. Zhu Xiaochun sees several children with &quot;stomach pain&quot; every time he visits a doctor. The children can&#39;t tell where the pain is, so they just say it hurts everywhere. &quot;You have to find the cause accurately. If it&#39;s a complication from surgery, you have to make a prompt decision.&quot; Otherwise, serious complications may occur. Sometimes there is a lot of reasoning involved in the diagnosis process.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A child who complained of stomachache said he was beaten by two classmates. After punching him, Zhu Xiaochun first asked him to check to see if he had injured his internal organs, but no obvious problems were found. After careful questioning, I found that the child had some diarrhea. In the end, other causes were ruled out, and it was basically concluded that the stomachache was caused by diarrhea. &quot;You can&#39;t limit yourself to his words. Sometimes it just happens.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Pediatrics is periodically overcrowded with consultations every year. Internal medicine is at the peak of seasonal influenza, and surgery is during the summer vacation—every summer, urology is the place to go. Pediatric offices are crowded with surgically circumcised children. As the director of the pediatric surgery department, Zhu Xiaochun needs to balance the work intensity of the department. In 2022, he transferred an attending doctor from the cardiorenal surgery department to support the urology department. This year, he really can&#39;t find anyone. Some doctors want to go to the countryside for free clinics and have to work at the transfer center. The hospital has no new recruits, so he can only wait for himself. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“There are only more than 8,000 pediatric surgeons in the country.” Zhu Xiaochun said that he believed the main reason was that pediatric treatment was so poor. In late November, he went to a free clinic in the county. The chief surgeon of a hospital said that the pediatric surgeons in his hospital were no longer willing to work. “Surgeries in small hospitals are all on the first floor, and the breast surgery is next to the pediatric surgery. Breast surgery is so easy.” , low risk, high performance. If you treat the same number of patients, pediatric surgery will be exhausted. The difference in effort is clear at a glance, but the performance is similar. If you can make a choice, how to choose?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Exploring new Solution&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The &quot;pediatrics shortage&quot; has been around for a long time. In 1998, the pediatrics major was eliminated from the undergraduate education of medical schools and replaced by the clinical medicine major. The pediatrics major was not subdivided until the graduate level. In 1999, undergraduate enrollment in pediatrics was suspended nationwide, and it was not resumed until 2016, when the “universal two-child” policy was implemented. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2022, the National Health Commission issued an implementation plan for the implementation of the 2021-2030 Outline for the Development of Women and Children in China. The plan points out that by 2030, there will be 1.12 pediatric practicing (assistant) doctors per 1,000 children, and the number of beds will increase to 3.17. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A doctor interviewed believes that in order to attract more people to choose pediatrics, the scores for the postgraduate entrance examination and practicing physician examination have been lowered. The hospital’s recruitment conditions for pediatric medical staff are also looser than those for adult departments, but in fact The effect is not good, and there is still a shortage of people in pediatrics because the crux of the problem has not been solved. “If departments like pediatrics and emergency departments, which are tired, hard-working and have little money, want to attract talents and reverse the talent gap, the most direct stimulus is to increase the investment of resources in the department and increase the income of the medical staff in the department. ”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the context of the “pediatric shortage”, the promotion of hierarchical diagnosis and treatment is particularly important to alleviate the “difficulty in pediatric medical care”. In 2015, the &quot;Guiding Opinions of the General Office of the State Council on Promoting the Construction of a Hierarchical Diagnosis and Treatment System&quot; was released, which clarified the concept of hierarchical diagnosis and treatment and proposed a model of first diagnosis at the grassroots level, two-way referral, acute and chronic treatment, and linkage between the upper and lower levels. Article 30 of the Basic Medical Care and Health Promotion Law, which came into effect in June 2020, once again emphasizes that &quot;the state promotes the implementation of a hierarchical diagnosis and treatment system for basic medical services and guides non-emergency patients to seek treatment at primary medical and health institutions first.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the statistical bulletin on the development of my country&#39;s health industry, in the past five years, the number of diagnoses and treatments in hospitals at all levels accounted for about 45% of the total number of diagnoses and treatments in medical and health institutions nationwide, and primary medical and health institutions accounted for about 50%, of which townships The diagnosis and treatment volume of health centers and community health service centers (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 毷体, 毷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Station&lt;/span>;) is about 24%, which is more than 80% in developed countries. The number of medical visits that occur in medical institutions outside hospitals is still far behind. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to promote the implementation of hierarchical diagnosis and treatment, large hospitals will form a consortium of public medical institutions with grassroots hospitals. Zhu Xiaochun introduced that Guangdong Maternal and Child Health Hospital has established a medical consortium with more than 100 units to provide technical support and supplement medical resources. “We will go to villages and towns to give lectures to the specialty alliances of the medical consortium and conduct remote consultations online. , allowing patients with mild symptoms to stay at the grassroots level, and allowing patients who must be transferred to be transferred in time.

Wu Tianlong feels that they can basically meet the needs of the community. &quot;Now many community residents will first choose to see a doctor in the community health service instead of going to a big hospital. The number of outpatient clinics has increased several times compared with before.&quot; He usually sees basic medical care. Respiratory diseases are also essential skills for social health doctors. Wu Tianlong sees sixty or seventy patients a day, with an average of 8 to 10 minutes per patient. Two-thirds of them are children, and most of them are respiratory infections. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Shenzhen Shekang’s hierarchical diagnosis and treatment is at the forefront of the country. During the fever peak in December 2022, Shekang’s fever clinic “carried” 65% of the diagnosis and treatment volume. In order to mobilize the enthusiasm of ordinary people to go to social health centers, Shenzhen City requires participants in the second and third tiers of basic medical insurance to select a social health center in the city as a designated medical institution for outpatient treatment, and continue to devote themselves to hospitals, public health Information collaboration between institutions and social health enables mutual recognition of test results and exchange of medical resources. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The most critical thing is to “straighten out the internal interest mechanism.” Li Chuangzeng, deputy director of the Shenzhen Municipal Health Commission, concluded, “Let doctors in large hospitals have the incentive to transfer patients; doctors in social health centers have the incentive to move up.

The stamping workshop here is stamped and formed with a force of up to 10,300 tons to become the body of the BMW car. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Behind these seemingly &quot;heavy industrial style&quot; scenes is the support of lighter and more fashionable &quot;green electricity&quot; - the production of two factories inside and outside Shanhaiguan is Renewable energy electricity is used. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Looking across the country, green power trading, which was officially launched two years ago, now covers the whole country and the rules are more complete. In the first three months of 2023, the national green power transaction scale has reached 25.026 billion kilowatt hours, exceeding the entire year of 2022. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Southern Weekend&#39;s research found that despite the rapid growth of green electricity trading volume, the endogenous motivation of different market entities to participate in green electricity trading is still weak. At present, green power transactions are dominated by large enterprises and foreign trade companies, while small and medium-sized enterprises are still &quot;bystanders&quot; to green power transactions. Data also shows that the country&#39;s renewable energy power generation will reach 2.7 trillion kilowatt hours in 2022, of which green power trading volume only accounts for 0.84%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The reason is that the &quot;Research Report on China&#39;s Green Electricity Consumption Path&quot; released by the Energy Foundation to support the Jianheng Certification Center pointed out that the renewable energy power in most provinces The weight of consumption responsibilities is mainly completed by power grid enterprises to ensure consumption, and the assessment indicators have not yet been specifically broken down and implemented on the electricity sales companies or power users that should be assessed; the green electricity trading market has not yet effectively formed a market-based pricing mechanism, and various regions give priority to regional Green power consumption, &quot;Only when the green power supply in the region cannot meet the consumption demand, the purchase of cheaper external green power will be considered.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;From this perspective, how to promote market entities of different sizes to participate in green electricity transactions in the future will be the focus of decision-makers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Zheng Ying, a special researcher at the China Carbon Neutral Fifty Forum and director of the Dual-Carbon Business Department of Beijing Electric Chain Technology, believes that when the &quot;dual-carbon&quot; policy is gradually advanced Under this situation, both large enterprises and small and medium-sized enterprises are facing increasing internal and external emission reduction constraints and pressures, and participating in medium and long-term green power transactions or purchasing green certificates will become important ways to reduce emissions. &quot;In the future, dual control assessment of energy consumption and even dual control assessment of carbon emissions will become the main battlefield for the domestic application of green power/green certificates.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Favor green power, and the &quot;giants&quot; will take the lead&lt;/h4>; &lt; p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Looking at the 2021 and 2022 Chinese enterprise green power transaction rankings compiled by Bloomberg New Energy Finance, it can be found that companies active in the green power market are roughly divided into Internet companies, large state-owned enterprises and foreign companies. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Internet technology companies have always presented themselves as low-carbon and avant-garde. However, data centers, as important infrastructure of the Internet, are also large energy consumers. The most important thing is to reduce the carbon emissions of data centers. The effective way is to use green electricity. This has also made Alibaba Cloud, Tencent, Chindata and GDS become big buyers of green electricity. In 2022, Alibaba&#39;s green power transaction volume reached 860 million kilowatt hours, and Tencent&#39;s reached 504 million kilowatt hours, both entering the top five in corporate green power procurement rankings. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;However, even for leading Internet companies, the proportion of green electricity usage in total electricity consumption is not high. In 2020, GDS&#39;s renewable energy usage ratio was 22.6%, and this number increased to 34.3% in 2021; during fiscal year 2022, 21.6% of the electricity used by Alibaba Cloud came from clean energy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Compared to Internet companies, green electricity trading by steel companies, traditional large carbon emitters, is more urgent. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Green electricity trading practitioners believe that large steel companies are often local leading companies and have always been the main targets of environmental protection supervision. They must play a role in practicing green development. Take the lead. Compared with improving processes, using green electricity is an easier and faster-effective emission reduction measure. In addition, in recent years, coal prices have been high, and thermal power prices have risen accordingly, making green power “less expensive.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;What&#39;s more important is the pressure from the external market - a large part of the high-precision steel products developed by steel companies must be sold to foreign companies or exported overseas, facing meet the stringent requirements of product carbon footprint. For example, in March 2022, HBIS Group purchased 270 million kilowatt-hours of green electricity at the North Hebei Power Trading Center, partly because HBIS signed a &quot;Memorandum of Cooperation on Building a Green Low-Carbon Steel Supply Chain&quot; with BMW Brilliance, one of its major customers. , HBIS provides BMW with high-strength steel with a lower carbon footprint by using green electricity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Foreign companies favor green power and have chosen to sign medium- and long-term green power agreements. This is due to factors such as the lack of international recognition of domestic green certificates and the more convenient green power transactions. related. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Take the German-owned enterprise BMW Brilliance as an example. In 2021, it purchased 2.78 billion kilowatt-hours of green electricity and was the &quot;big buyer&quot; of green electricity transactions that year. It can meet the requirements of BMW Shenyang factory to use 100% green electricity for production. Guo Junhan, manager of BMW Brilliance&#39;s business development and corporate sustainability department, said that the company&#39;s purchase and use of green electricity will eventually be summarized in the non-financial statements of the German BMW Group and go through PwC (China) and PricewaterhouseCoopers. Audited by Road (Germany) to ensure that it meets the EU’s carbon emission control requirements for car companies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The EU&#39;s green electricity trading is very different from China&#39;s. Many European audit institutions are not familiar with China&#39;s green electricity trading model, making the entire audit process relatively lengthy. &quot;In view of the situation and types of China&#39;s green electricity transactions, including China&#39;s green certificate, we will have regular communications with the audit institutions to inform them of China&#39;s current development situation,&quot; Guo Junhan said. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;How to &quot;prioritize&quot; green electricity&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Compared with large enterprises that are the vanguard of emission reduction, the products of domestic export-oriented enterprises and foreign enterprises Suppliers are also feeling the pressure to reduce carbon emissions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Zhejiang Shenzhou International is one of the first companies in Zhejiang Province to participate in green electricity transactions. It is engaged in OEM processing for internationally renowned clothing brands. These clothing brands are relatively Pay attention to the carbon footprint of products and ask supply chain partners to get on board. Especially in the context of the EU&#39;s imminent imposition of &quot;carbon tariffs&quot;, purchasing green power is an important means to maintain orders from international partners. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The general manager of a Dongguan electronics company told Southern Weekend that 40% of the company&#39;s annual turnover comes from export business, and its overseas customers value the company&#39;s green electricity transactions. volume, the use of green electricity has become a bonus for the company’s exports. &quot;Green power has a premium over thermal power. Based on cost, we determine the proportion of green power to buy. It mainly depends on how much electricity is needed to manufacture export products. The rest still uses thermal power.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text- align: left;&quot;>;Song Yu, a trader of Envision Energy&#39;s environmental products, also told Southern Weekend that their customers are mainly export-oriented companies in the Yangtze River Delta and Pearl River Delta. &quot;The main purpose of buying green power is to meet the requirements of foreign customers.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;However, more domestic small and medium-sized enterprises have not yet &quot;prioritized&quot; green power. &quot;Whether it is total energy consumption control or the weight of renewable energy consumption responsibilities, these policies are issued by various ministries and commissions to local governments, rather than directly targeting electricity-consuming enterprises.&quot; This also makes it almost impossible for small and medium-sized enterprises to purchase green electricity. Endogenous motivation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The best way to inspire motivation is to discover business needs. For example, many small and medium-sized enterprises are concerned about whether green power purchases can be given priority or exemption from contract performance during special periods. From 2021 to 2022, many provinces in China will experience power shortages and even power rationing. Some companies asked Song Yu whether they can give priority to ensuring electricity consumption when buying green power. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Four Yunnan companies that have purchased green electricity also told Southern Weekend that Yunnan, which mainly relies on hydropower, will enter a power shortage every autumn and winter dry season. According to the state, enterprises must make concessions for residents&#39; electricity use. They have not heard that buying green electricity can avoid power restrictions. This shows that although the state and local governments encourage enterprises to participate in green electricity transactions, there is still a gap between the incentives and the expectations of enterprises. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Southern Weekend found that Qinghai Province&#39;s &quot;2023 Power Trading Plan&quot; stipulates that for users participating in green power trading within the province, the assessment exemption for deviations in power will be appropriately relaxed According to the standard, users who use more than 30% of green electricity will be exempted from the monthly deviation assessment; Shanxi Province&#39;s &quot;Implementation Plan for Promoting Green Consumption&quot; proposes that when implementing orderly electricity use on the user side during periods of tight power supply, the user&#39;s historical green electricity consumption during the year will be exempted. The proportions are reversely allocated to orderly power consumption tasks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;However, no similar policies have been introduced in the southeastern coastal areas where the demand for green electricity is stronger. Li Wei, an expert who works in the power system, once participated in the design of the green certificate system. She told Southern Weekend that inter-provincial green power transactions are subject to space and physical restrictions, and it is difficult for enterprises in the southeastern region, which is relatively short of electricity, to obtain priority for electricity use by purchasing green power. &quot;For example, in Zhejiang, the amount of green electricity that can be transferred from other provinces through UHV every day is limited. For example, there are 100 million kilowatt-hours. If Zhejiang itself can generate 100 million kilowatt-hours of green electricity, then there will only be 200 million kilowatt-hours of green electricity on the market. , while supplies last.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img img-id=&quot;74034&quot; group-id=&quot;0&quot; asset-id=&quot;70833&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/05/cbac554b2d.JPG&quot; img-title=&quot;August 21, 2023, photovoltaic panels Neatly arranged in the national renewable energy demonstration zone in Zhangjiakou, Hebei Province.

When the provincial-level energy consumption authorities completed the dual energy consumption assessment requirements, they actually followed the principle of &quot;grasping the big and letting go of the small&quot; and decomposed the task indicators to some key energy-consuming enterprises, but &quot;opened the door to small and medium-sized enterprises&quot;. &quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In addition, Zheng Ying learned from research on some companies that many companies have not been punished even if they have not completed the dual energy consumption control requirements issued by the government. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;This may be because under the pressure of economic downturn, local governments must consider not only the ability of enterprises to withstand punitive measures, but also the negative impact on investment promotion. Under the dual energy consumption control requirements, it is still unclear to what extent the willingness of enterprises to purchase green certificates and green electricity will increase. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;I think that when the time comes, we still need to consider forming a punishment mechanism for companies that fail to complete their targets, otherwise the green certificate/green electricity trading will be active The degree of improvement may still be limited. After all, at the current development stage of the green certificate market, if we want to enhance the willingness and motivation of enterprises to purchase on a large scale, we still need stronger policy guidance and constraints, rather than relying solely on independent and voluntary purchases by enterprises.&quot; Zheng Ying analyzed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The good news is that the &quot;14th Five-Year Plan&quot; has proposed to gradually transform from dual control of energy consumption to dual control of carbon emissions. By then, companies can achieve carbon emission standards by purchasing green electricity and other methods if the carbon indicators are insufficient. Before this change occurs, the dual energy consumption control system should improve its assessment indicator distribution, reward and punishment mechanism, and lay a solid foundation for the debut of dual carbon emission control, which is the proper meaning of the title. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The linkage between green power, green certificates and the carbon market is imminent&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;If green power can offset CCER (nationally certified voluntary emission reductions), It will undoubtedly greatly enhance the motivation of enterprises to purchase green electricity. &quot;Many of our customers are concerned about whether the green certificate they bought can be used in carbon trading in the future to offset part of the carbon emissions.&quot; said the person in charge of a Tianjin electricity sales company. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In fact, green power is the participant in carbon trading that can most accurately measure and verify. The green certificate records all attribute information of green power, which is natural and Accurate carbon emission reduction measurement methods are naturally connected with the carbon trading system represented by CCER. However, &quot;electricity-carbon linkage&quot; seems to be a matter of course, but in fact there are many difficulties. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In August 2023, the National Development and Reform Commission and three other ministries and commissions jointly issued the &quot;Notice on Full Coverage of Renewable Energy Green Power Certificates to Promote Renewable Energy Electricity Consumption&quot; ” (hereinafter referred to as the “Notice”), emphasizes the connection between the green certificate and the carbon market. On October 24, the Ministry of Ecology and Environment formulated and released the methodology for four voluntary greenhouse gas emission reduction projects, including grid-connected solar thermal power generation and grid-connected offshore wind power generation. It also specified uniqueness and required that the projects did not participate in other greenhouse gas emission reduction transactions. mechanism, there will be no double recognition of projects or double calculation of emission reductions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In this case, whether the environmental attributes of the power generation of relevant renewable energy projects will be classified as green certificates or CCERs in the future has attracted much attention in the industry. Zheng Ying said that the &quot;Notice&quot; makes it clear that the green certificate is the only proof of the environmental attributes of my country&#39;s renewable energy power and the only certificate for identifying the production and consumption of renewable energy power. If the environmental attributes of renewable energy can be recognized by both Green Certificate and CCER, it will cause the environmental attributes to be repeatedly developed and calculated in the two mechanisms. &quot;The worst result is that the green certificate and CCER are both restricted in international recognition.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Currently, more than 300 companies including Apple, Google, TSMC, and Coca-Cola have Many well-known international companies have joined the RE100 initiative. The green certificates purchased by many domestic export-oriented companies need to be certified by RE100. However, Li Wei introduced that RE100 does not fully recognize domestic green certificates, but &quot;conditional recognition&quot;. One of the reasons RE100 believes that &quot;after the China Green Certificate is issued, environmental rights and interests should follow the green certificate. However, some power generation projects have also obtained environmental certificates issued by CCER, which results in double measurement and double benefits. Electricity consuming enterprises It was forced to self-certify. For example, for the electricity it purchased from the wind farm, it did not apply for any other environmental certificates except for the green certificate.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On October 18, 2023, the Ministry of Ecology and Environment announced the &quot;Notice on Doing a Good Job in Reporting and Verifying Greenhouse Gas Emissions of Enterprises in Some Key Industries from 2023 to 2025&quot; &quot;It is mentioned that &quot;Enterprises that purchase non-fossil energy electricity through market-based transactions must separately report this part of the electricity consumption and provide relevant certification materials,&quot; and stipulates that the certification materials do not include green power certificates. The document also stipulates that the emissions corresponding to non-fossil energy power purchased by enterprises will be temporarily calculated based on the average carbon emission factor of the national power grid, which means that the green power purchased by enterprises will not play a role in carbon emission accounting for the time being. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img img-id=&quot;74035&quot; group-id=&quot;0&quot; asset-id=&quot;70834&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/05/08305028c4.png&quot; img-title=&quot;On October 18, 2023, the Ministry of Ecology and Environment announced &quot;About Doing a Good Job in 2023&quot; —Notice on Greenhouse Gas Emission Reporting and Verification of Enterprises in Some Key Industries in 2025&quot;.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;749&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm. com/cms/medias/image/23/12/05/08305028c4.png&quot; data-key=&quot;260832&quot; style=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center; &quot;>;On October 18, 2023, the Ministry of Ecology and Environment announced the &quot;Notice on Completing the Reporting and Verification of Greenhouse Gas Emissions by Enterprises in Some Key Industries from 2023 to 2025&quot; Official website of the Ministry of Ecology and Environment | Picture&lt;br>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Zheng Ying believes that in order to solve the coordination problem, it is first necessary to clarify what the environmental attributes of renewable energy power are. &quot;If it is recognized that the green certificate represents zero emissions, the electricity represented by the green certificate may be directly calculated as zero emissions when accounting for Scope 2 emissions in the future; if it is counted as an emission reduction, its application in carbon emission accounting will be different from that of CCER. The difference is that CCER is also an emission reduction. The only difference is that in order to prevent greenwashing, the emission reduction represented by the green certificate can only be used to reduce emissions from purchased power in Scope 2. In fact, what is shown on the current green certificate is Emission reduction.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;After clarifying the environmental attributes of green electricity, the problem of double counting still needs to be solved. The first is how to deal with the environmental attributes of the electricity represented by the green certificate when calculating the grid emission factor; the second is what grid emission factor should be used to calculate the purchased electricity when the consumer purchases or does not purchase the green certificate. carbon emission. How to improve the grid emission factors to ensure that the environmental attributes of the green certificate will not be reused or calculated on the power generation side or the consumer side. &quot;The core of the whole matter will eventually point to the construction of China&#39;s power grid emission factor system and whether the data of the two markets of green certificate and CCER can be shared.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; >;Li Wei believes that the best way is to directly apply the value of green certificates in carbon emission reduction to the carbon market. For example, for offshore wind power projects that are likely to be included in CCER, if the Ministry of Ecology and Environment recognizes the value of carbon emission reductions represented by the green certificate, it can allow the carbon emission reductions represented by the green certificate of the offshore wind power project to directly enter the CCER market without having to Offshore wind power projects are then issued a CCER certificate and given another environmental right to avoid double counting. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Increase the scale of cross-provincial and regional green power transactions&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;It should be pointed out that although the current cross-provincial and cross-regional power market trading platform has been established, However, in the medium and long-term direct electricity trading market, direct transactions within the province are still the mainstay. A report by PricewaterhouseCoopers pointed out that direct transactions between provinces accounted for only 2%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In addition to differences in trading rules, this current situation is also an important reason for the &quot;reluctance to sell&quot; green electricity in some western regions rich in scenery resources. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;According to the analysis of the &quot;Capital Green Power Trading Procurement Policy and Suggestions Report&quot; written and released by Beijing Nengjian Technology supported by the Energy Foundation, Inner Mongolia, Shanxi, and the three eastern provinces They are not very willing to sell green power to the outside world, which makes the capital Beijing face many difficulties in signing contracts with foreign provinces and cities to purchase green power. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Many provinces are reluctant to sell green electricity. The reason is to give priority to ensuring the completion of the province&#39;s renewable energy power consumption task. &quot;Another reason is that the western region, with its cheap electricity prices and abundant renewable energy, will attract certain high-energy-consuming companies to invest locally, leaving room for future growth in green electricity consumption,&quot; Zheng Ying said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;According to the above report, at present, cross-provincial and cross-regional green electricity transactions are mainly carried out through &quot;network-to-network&quot; and &quot;point-to-network&quot; transactions. &quot;The transaction method breaks the power grid company&#39;s control over the 13 cross-provincial and cross-regional power channels. However, the country has not yet clarified the specific implementation details of the &quot;point-to-point&quot; transaction, and the institutional barriers have not been completely broken. The State Grid has not yet liberalized the &quot;point-to-point&quot; transaction in the region. “Inter-provincial green electricity transactions lack market vitality. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;For provinces and regions that rely on external power transfer, they need to comprehensively consider their own location characteristics and seek diversified energy supply solutions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Zhou Feng, director of the clean power project of the Energy Foundation, pointed out that a typical southeast coastal province represented by Zhejiang can not only deploy new high-voltage channels, but also It can strengthen cooperation with the development of renewable energy and the upstream and downstream of the new energy industry chain between government and provincial enterprises between provinces and provincial enterprises. For example, Zhejiang Tianneng Group reached a cooperation with Gansu Province Baiyedon Color Group and Golden Silk Road Fund to jointly promote the construction of a new energy industry ecosystem in Zhejiang and Gansu provinces.

Since the asteroid impact in the 1980s, scientists have successively discovered evidence that evidence can prove the cause of this extinction, especially the discovery of the Hick Suruberry Pit on the Yicatan Peninsula in Mexico, which provides a reference for further research on the impact and extinction process. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;img alt = &quot;66 million years ago, asteroid hit the Mexican Yicatan Peninsula, a fire ball with a diameter of 10 to 15 kilometers hit a 180 -kilometer wide large at a speed of nearly 20 kilometers per second.

The 180 -kilometer wide pit released huge energy and gave a fatal blow to the dinosaurs that ruled the earth at the time. &amp; nbsp; &lt;span>; Visual China | Figure &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Regarding the basic process of great extinction, the scientific community generally believes that the material generated by the Hick Suruber was sprayed to the atmosphere, which led to the global climate Sudden changes and abnormally decreased temperatures, so that a large number of creatures cannot survive. But what material participation has promoted the sudden changes in the climate and the specific details, these problems are still controversial. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Recently, researchers from the Royal Observatory of Belgium, the University of Brussels Liberty and other institutions simulated the changes in the climate by analyzing the sedimentary data, thinking that silicate dust plays an important role in triggering this crisis. The size of these particles is 0.8 to 8 microns, forming a huge dust cloud group into a flat flow layer, and then spreads the world to cover the sky and obstruct the effective radiation of photosynthesis for a long time. The cooling effect of sulfur -containing gases such as sulfur -containing gases and high fires after the impact may cause the disaster of the great extinction of this creature. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;Our research clearly states that the impact of sulfur and smoke may have been overvalued before, and the impact of fine dust may be underestimated.&quot; Philip Kyk, a professor at the University of Liberty, who participated in this research, Philippe Claeys told the southern weekend reporter, &quot;We strongly advocate the latter is the main reason for extinction.&quot; &lt;/P>; &lt;p>; Because the simulation data shows that the amount of silicic acid dust is the largest after the impact, and these are these Dust and smoke can be suspended in the atmosphere for 15 years. In comparison, although sulfur -containing gases can also cover the sun and make the temperature of the earth cold, its settlement speed is fast, and it only stays in the atmosphere for nearly 8 years. From this comprehensive, after the impact of Hick Suruber, it may affect the climate at the time by interference in the atmosphere for 15 years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Related research was published in Nature Geoscience in November 2023. These impacts may include the global average surface temperature decreased by as much as 25 degrees Celsius, creating endless &quot;cold winter&quot;, and if the temperature wants to recover as early, it may take nearly 20 years. What is even more fatal is that due to the influence of a large amount of dust, the recovery of photosynthesis also takes about two years. During this period, the cold and cold environment will cause food deficiency, and species that cannot adapt to this environment for a long time may be extinct. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Many of the latest studies have also been confirmed by paleontological evidence. For example, research shows that the photosynthetic effect is first recovered in the summer of the southern hemisphere. Consistent. However, in the future, it is still necessary to study the records of related strata in different places around the world to better understand the differences and recovery of the extinction and recovery of various regions, so as to better confirm the impact of this extinction. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The sedimentary samples analyzed in the current research are originally from the fossil site of Tanis, North Dakota, and belong to the White-Cycles-Ancient Merchants Line of the Land. Three thousand kilometers. 66 million years ago, when the asteroid hits the position of the Yicatan Peninsula, a fireball of 10 to 15 kilometers in diameter is at a speed of nearly 20 kilometers per second at the ground. At the same time, the melted sphere and mineral debris shot out of the pit like an artillery shell, falling in the distance, and then deposited in the rock layer with the dust, smoke and other substances that settle down, and became a testimony of this incident. &amp; nbsp; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In 1980, Professor LUIS W. Alvarez, Professor of the University of California, who had won the Nobel Prize in Physics, has already won the Nobel Prize in Physics. Alvarez and others found that among some deep-sea limestals in Italy, Denmark, New Zealand and other places, the accuracy of the background base before the Baiji-Gujinji creatures is abnormally more than dozens or even hundreds of times before the Great Kondi Biostatic. It is speculated that these crickets do not come from the crust, but aliens. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Walter Alvarez was an associate professor at the Department of Geology and Earth Physics at the University of California, Berkeley. They together published an article in Science and proposed that asteroids hit the earth and caused the White-Clear-Ancients Premature hypothesis of Disciplinary Biostatic. According to the analysis at the time, after a huge little asteroid hit the earth, it would inject 60 times the rocks of its own quality into the atmosphere in the form of powder, and then floated along the flat stratum to the world to suppress the photosynthesis and cause biological extinction. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The latest research further proves the explanation of dust around the dust, and negates the more critical statement about the dangers of sulfur. Felip Chrys, who participated in the latest research, is also a geologist, planetary scientist, and celestial chemist. He is now a professor at archeology, environmental change, and Earth Chemistry Research Center of the University of Liberty of Brussels. Walter Alvarez cooperated to conduct research in this field. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; It is worth noting that in September 2022, researchers at Datmouth College, Princeton University and other institutions analyzed the data of the fire into the province of Rock Provincial and Potential Bio, and believed The main driving factor of great extinction. The reason is that from the perspective of the geological timeline, the emergence of the fire in the province of fire has a clear correlation with the time interval between the animals that appear to be replaced. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; This study was published in the &quot;Academy of Sciences&quot; (PNAS). The fire of the fire is a large -scale volcanic eruption, which usually includes more than 100,000 cubic kilometers of magma. Wherever it goes, hundreds of thousands of or even millions of square kilometers of magma can be formed. A large amount of carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide and other substances can be released. Researchers from Dartmouth College and other institutions believe that the two are not accidental at the same time. It may be a causal relationship, but it is not enough to determine the causal relationship with a certain extermination. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;Each extinction is a complex and different process, and it cannot be attributed to a single reason, such as large volcanic incidents. Because similar or almost similar time is not enough to prove that the volcanic effect is caused by extinction. An excessive simplified way. To find the culprit, the culprit requires excellent detective work. &quot;Philip Chrys explained to the southern weekend reporter that&quot; 66 million years ago, the impact of a large meteorite on the Yicatan Peninsula caused dinosaurs With most of the extinction of land and marine biospheres, scientists have a wide consensus on this. We have only studied the Baiji Period-Ancient Broker Line of 66 million years ago. Back is the cause of extinction, but we cannot explain other big extinction events accordingly. The collapse of these large biospheres is likely to be much more complicated than some people think. &quot;&lt;/P>; &lt;p>; &lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 06 Dec 2023 18:25:05 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[10万亿级中信集团迎来新任掌舵者]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261996]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;i>; 2023-12-06 17:42:27 &lt;/i>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>; According to the official website of CITIC Group, on the morning of December 6, China CITIC Group Co., Ltd. held a cadre meeting. .

Barking or not, according to Chen Qiang, the person in charge of the animal rescue organization, it is unreasonable for dogs to remain in this state for a long time in a dense space. (Screenshot of Southern Weekend reporter Weng Rongrong)&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The end of poor sales is to bring goods&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Since 2022, Xin Chaochao often visits the stray dog ​​live broadcast room. In the footage, most of the stray dogs are crowded In a small room, looking listless. Some dogs had signs hanging on them, saying things like &quot;Please feed&quot; and &quot;We&#39;ve been hungry for a long time.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Most of the live broadcast content is monotonous, and the specific conditions of the dogs are not introduced, but they are repeatedly sold miserably. Xin Chaochao felt sorry for these thin stray dogs and placed an order for dog food according to the anchor&#39;s prompts without hesitation. A serving of dog food costs about ten yuan, which is not high. She buys two or three servings at a time as a small act of kindness. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Later, Xin Chaochao went to an offline stray dog ​​rescue base. She found that the staff knew the life experience of each dog very well, and most of the dogs were very energetic, which was completely different from those in the live broadcast room. She tried to leave comments in the live broadcast room, asking the anchor whether she could adopt or volunteer, but these comments were always ignored by the anchor. She realized something was wrong. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Xue was once blocked by a stray dog ​​live broadcast room. She now volunteers at an offline stray dog ​​base. At that time, she had insomnia at night, so she would open the live broadcast room and watch the puppy sleep for a while. After watching more, she found that although many live broadcast accounts were displayed in different cities, the layout, decoration, dog status, etc. of the room were almost exactly the same. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Once, she saw a live broadcast room showing a stray dog ​​in the same city as herself, so she left a message in the live broadcast room, saying that she had rescue experience and asked if she could go and help. The anchor has repeatedly emphasized that he is short of food and people. Li Xue left several messages, but the anchor did not respond and later blocked her. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Guangzhou Apai Caring for Small Animals Social Development Center has been established for seven years and specializes in stray animal rescue. The person in charge, Chen Qiang, has also seen similar live broadcasts of stray dogs. In her experience, real animal rescues will let the animals out to walk around and bask in the sun, but the dogs in the live broadcast room are usually just sleeping. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She believes that if the density of animals is too high, it will be difficult to sleep peacefully for a long time, and dogs have territorial and spatial awareness, and too much concentration can easily lead to biting. &quot;In a crowded space, more than 20 animals are sleeping together, as if they are in love with each other, which is contrary to our understanding.&quot; Chen Qiang told Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for the operation of asking viewers to buy dog ​​food and send it to the base, Chen Qiang thinks it is also very suspicious. The goods taken may not actually be sent, and the transaction does not really happen. &quot;We don&#39;t know. All I know is that the money has been paid.&quot; Li Xue also believes that &quot;it&#39;s just a name, I don&#39;t know whether it will be shipped or not.&quot; She also observed that some new live broadcast rooms do not put out shopping links as soon as they are launched, but &quot;pretend to have no desires and desires for two days&quot; before starting to bring goods. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to dog food, these stray dog ​​live broadcast accounts will also sell pet products or common daily necessities, guiding viewers to click on links to purchase. Chen Qiang found that the origin of many products was unknown. “We cannot see where the products come from or whether they have been to the brand or factory for evaluation.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporter clicked on a purchase link. The product name is &quot;Rescue Station (Specialized Whole Dog Food)&quot;. There are eight specifications to choose from. The price ranges from 30 yuan to 1,000 yuan. It has been sold. 93 pieces. But looking at the store where the link is located, the business license shows that the operator is a stationery store, an individual industrial and commercial owner, and the registration date is 2020. The store has four types of dog food on sale. The link with the highest sales was put on the shelves on October 20, and 383 copies have been sold. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The store’s customer service told the Southern Weekend reporter that the dog food was produced in the warehouse and sent directly to the base, and then the Southern Weekend reporter was blacklisted. The other two dog food stores said they have cooperation with anchors, who promote the manufacturers or receive commissions for bringing goods. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;img alt=&quot;Window shopping link of a stray dog ​​live broadcast account.

(Screenshot by Southern Weekend reporter Weng Rongrong)&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Self-written and self-directed rescue script&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In addition to live broadcasts, such accounts will also shoot videos of rescuing stray dogs. Li Xue once watched a rescue video. The anchor claimed to have rescued an injured puppy. It was so seriously injured that its bones were even exposed. Every once in a while, the anchor will update its recovery status. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Xue sent the video to her rescue group, and a veterinarian told her that based on the tragic situation in the video, it would be impossible to return to the current state unless it was a medical miracle. Li Xue guessed that the owner of the account might be the dog abuser himself. He was directing and acting, and the video was actually a flashback update. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Xue once saw an anchor filming at a dog meat stall, claiming to have bought the dogs and calling on everyone to donate. She thought this was counterintuitive, &quot;As an animal rescuer, going to a place where dogs are slaughtered to take pictures is something you wouldn&#39;t do under normal circumstances.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In January 2022, according to media reports, Ma Changchun, a stray dog ​​anchor in Xuyi County, Huai&#39;an City, Jiangsu Province, was suspected of stealing dogs and using stray dogs to live broadcast to defraud rewards. Data shows that he has more than 1.51 million fans, and his total live broadcast income in 180 days is as high as 16.228 million yuan. A fellow anchorman said that Ma Changchun once went to his base to buy a dog for live broadcast, and when the dog got sick, he sold it directly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Man Yun was one of the first bloggers to expose this matter, and had previously donated money to some live broadcast rooms. At that time, people on Douyin began to question Ma Changchun&#39;s fraud. The evidence cited included: the videos posted by his account were labeled &quot;meat dog breeding&quot;, and there were dog catching nets in his courtyard. Man Yun synthesized this information and posted it on his account. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Due to the large traffic on Manyun’s account, more and more netizens are approaching her to provide clues. Some people claimed that a stray dog ​​in Ma Changchun&#39;s live broadcast room was the dog he had lost before, but his comments and private message requests were ignored; netizens asked Ma Changchun if he sells dogs, and he once gave an affirmative answer; a caring person donated 250 kilograms of rice and 60 kilograms of salmon mince, but Ma still said that the dog was not full. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Afterwards, Man Yun and some caring people called the police. Afterwards, the local police said that they had conducted an on-site investigation and found that there was currently no problem with the source of the dog and that no relevant illegal activities had been found. Soon after, Ma Changchun’s account was banned and removed from the platform, and this millionaire anchor disappeared from the Internet world. Since then, the live broadcast of stray dogs whose authenticity is difficult to distinguish has planted doubts in people&#39;s minds. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A stray dog ​​live broadcast room teacher told Southern Weekend reporters that in order to create this type of account, first of all, &quot;there must be a place to raise dogs, dogs, and dog food.&quot; He concluded that it is very simple to find a venue. It can be an old factory building or a simple greenhouse. Dogs can be adopted or bought cheaply from the dog market. “You can also cooperate with other dog farms and find the ones that can attract audiences, such as Dogs can be cute, unique, and capable of fighting, or they can be pitiful and sympathetic.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He mentioned that if he wanted to appear miserable, &quot;unless (he) adopts a stray dog.&quot; He also suggested, &quot;There is no need to have so many stray dogs at once. If you have a few stray dogs, each one has a name and has its own characteristics and stories. Isn&#39;t it better than having more than 70 stray dogs?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt; p>; &quot;It is too easy to get such a bunch of dogs in this society.&quot; Xin Chaochao speculated that the dogs in some live broadcast rooms may be &quot;dogs that people in the countryside do not want, or are stolen, or Dogs that are sold at low prices in breeding farms, or from the pet market.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;While doing volunteer activities at the rescue base, Li Xue learned that some stray dog ​​live broadcast rooms did not have their own dog farms, but rented them temporarily. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;span>;&lt;strong>;Is there support for offline adoption and rescue, and is there any follow-up? &lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Apai Care Small Animal Social Development Center currently has about 80 animals, almost all of which were rescued by caring people who notified the center after encountering them by chance. Chen Qiang told a reporter from Southern Weekend that at most, he would receive 70 or 80 stray animal rescue messages a day, and “sometimes it’s impossible to save them at all.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Most of the stray animals are seriously injured and sick. In addition to treatment, the center also bathes and deworms the animals regularly, so that they can be adopted smoothly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Any base that really helps stray animals is willing to adopt the animals, because only in this way can more resources be freed up to receive new animals.” According to Chen Qiang’s observation, many stray dog ​​live broadcast rooms do not They will respond positively to the audience&#39;s desire to adopt, and will not let anyone know its detailed address and go on-site inspection. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporters found that although some stray dog ​​live broadcast rooms claim to allow adoption on their homepages, the conditions are tied to money. For example, a live broadcast room claims to have more than 100 dogs. As long as you insist on &quot;cloud raising&quot; in the live broadcast room for three months, you can adopt one and take it home. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The so-called &quot;cloud feeding&quot; means &quot;adding meat to their daily meals&quot;, that is, donations. The anchor said, &quot;If you can&#39;t stick to them for three months, don&#39;t tell me how much you like them. Even if you take them back, you may not be able to live better than me.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Chen Qiang believes that Yunyang sounds &quot;like a bundled sale.&quot; The person in charge of another animal rescue center in Guangzhou told Southern Weekend reporters that in general animal adoption, the adopter&#39;s concept of pet care and sense of responsibility are valued, and they can have a general understanding during the communication process. After the animal is adopted, they will do some return visits in the first two years to understand the animal&#39;s living conditions. If there are no problems, they will not disturb it again. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Li Xue’s view, whether to support offline public adoption is also one of the ways to distinguish between genuine and fake live broadcast rooms. If the other party is willing to disclose the address and accept adoption, it is best to go to the homepage to see if the other party has been selling the dog. &quot;Regular rescues want to adopt the dog out more, and they prefer to take photos of the lively and positive side of the dog.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At present, the monthly expenditure of Apai Care for Small Animals Social Development Center is 70,000 to 80,000 yuan. As a legally registered public welfare organization, 80% of their funding sources rely on public donations. One of the channels is to launch fundraising projects through public fundraising platforms. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporters found that many stray dog ​​live broadcast rooms also have public fundraising links. When you click on the link, the project information shows that it has been registered with the Civil Affairs Bureau, but the content of the project is inconsistent with the situation mentioned in the live broadcast room. incompatible. In addition, Li Xue believes that whether there is a follow-up to the rescue is also one of the ways to identify it. Formal rescue will usually update the follow-up situation, including the details of the use of the money, and will also make it public. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;After all, it is something across the screen. Instead of distinguishing what is true and false on the Internet, it is better to understand the real things in the local area. What you can see is the real thing. No matter what you do on the Internet, Even if we try to identify it, we can&#39;t be 100% sure,&quot; Xin Chaochao told Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since the Ma Changchun incident, Man Yun has not watched the stray dog ​​live broadcast room for a long time. &quot;Because I was deceived, I am really sad. How can they take advantage of everyone like this? I no longer watch it.&quot; &quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Now, Manyun mainly rescues animals in real life and feeds stray animals when they encounter them. She rescued two stray dogs, which were eventually adopted by friends, and she also owns a stray dog ​​that a friend picked up. &quot;I feel like it&#39;s so tiring to distinguish this kind of thing, so just do it in reality. The things around you are more important and you can&#39;t see them online.&quot; Man Yun said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As the person in charge of a relief organization, Chen Qiang feels torn, “Sometimes I really hope to tell the public about things that are not really charity work, but sometimes I’m afraid that the public doesn’t have the ability to distinguish and will misunderstand many real ( (Rescue) organization. Anyway, I can’t tell the difference, so I just say you are all liars, which is really contradictory.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“It’s very helpless, there is no other way, your kindness is probably the reason why they wander. &quot;Li Xue said, &quot;When there is no way to identify, it is great to do a good job in helping people around you.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti; &quot;>;(At the request of the interviewees, Li Xue, Xin Chaochao and Manyun are pseudonyms)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 06 Dec 2023 16:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[多地健康码重出江湖？相关部门有必要澄清以释众疑丨快评]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261962]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-12-06 15:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;Recently, there are media reports that health codes in some places have &quot;reappeared&quot; &quot;Jianghu&quot; has aroused strong public attention. Nowadays, &quot;Category B and B management&quot; have been implemented to deal with the new coronavirus, and many places have also announced that the health code system will be offline and relevant data will be destroyed. Why is the health code back on the scene? &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;Recently, respiratory infectious diseases have broken out again. At this time, the health code has returned to the world, which makes many people wonder. However, some netizens said that this is just because the health code system in some places has not been offline and has always been there. It is not that it has just &quot;reappeared&quot; recently, so there is no need to worry. In response to relevant questions, the official citizen hotline in some places stated that as long as it does not affect life and travel, it is &quot;nothing&quot;, meaning that there is no need to worry about it &lt;span style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;>;, &quot;(epidemic) ) has passed.&quot;&lt;/span>;However, the health code is of great importance, and it is still necessary for relevant departments to provide further explanations to eliminate public doubts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;After the COVID-19 &quot;Category B and B&quot;, the future of the health code has aroused widespread discussion. Many places have announced that they will offline the health code system and delete the data. For example, on February 14, 2023, the relevant departments of a certain province issued an announcement announcing that from 11:00 on February 16, 2023, service entrances such as antigen self-testing, health declaration, digital space, and epidemic prevention workbench will be completely closed. Delete and destroy all data related to the service to ensure the security of personal information. Although the announcement at the time did not mention that the health code applet would be completely offline and all data deleted, the public generally believed that the health code had completed its historical mission and should completely withdraw from the historical stage and destroy all data behind the entire system. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;There is no doubt that the health code system stores a large amount of personal information. Information such as name, ID number, mobile phone number, and even face authentication are all extremely sensitive personal information. The health code system may also store travel information such as when and where each person has been, and medical and health information such as whether they have been vaccinated. This information is also personal privacy. During the epidemic, for the needs of prevention and control, the public can understand, accept and support. After the epidemic is over, the relevant systems have no reason to continue to save these users’ private data and should be destroyed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;At that time, Wang Chunhui, a member of the Information and Communication Economics Expert Committee of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology and director of the Network and Data Law Research Department of the Chinese Behavioral Law Society, also said in an interview with the media that itinerary cards, health codes The mission has ended, the purpose of processing personal information is no longer necessary, and all personal information should be deleted in accordance with the law. Many places have also announced that personal data in the health code system will be destroyed, and some cities have also held public destruction ceremonies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;However, judging from the current situation, there are still many places where the health code system seems to have not been offline, and some places still retain at least part of the data. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;Storing this data for a long time, even if the health code system is not completely offline, the risk of data leakage will increase dramatically. Because after the epidemic, the technical maintenance of the health code system has basically come to a standstill. If the data is not destroyed and the system is not offline and is exposed to the Internet, it is likely to be attacked by hackers. If the data is leaked, the consequences will be disastrous. Even when the health code system was still running, the information of 48.5 million users of a certain health code system was suspected to have appeared on the dark web for sale. Investigators checked 47 sets of data published by the sellers and found that the names, ID numbers, and mobile phone numbers of these users were all true, and they had indeed registered for the city&#39;s health code application. These leaked data will exist permanently on the dark web and will continue to be sold back and forth. The mobile phone number can be changed, but the name and ID number are used for a lifetime. You don’t know when this information may be used to commit telecom fraud. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;The health code system is independently developed by each locality, and each locality is responsible for the handling after deactivation. Some places have announced that they will stop services and destroy data, but judging from the current situation, some places have not actually done this. Of course, there are also health code applications in many places that have indeed stopped serving, and mini programs are no longer available. But users have no way of knowing whether the data behind it has been destroyed. It is necessary for an authoritative third party to supervise and verify the deactivation and data destruction of health code systems in various places to ensure that these data, which store a large amount of user sensitive information, are completely destroyed and will not be leaked or used without the user&#39;s knowledge. case for other purposes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;Whether the health code is &quot;reappearing&quot; or &quot;never offline&quot;, it shows that at least some data is still retained in some places. It is necessary for these places to issue official clarifications on this, and to take down the health code program under supervision as soon as possible and destroy the data to eliminate public doubts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 06 Dec 2023 15:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[“中印两国可以同时崛起”:访印度前驻华大使阿肖克·康特]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261956]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;i>; 2023-12-06 14:00:00 &lt;/i>; &lt;/div>; &lt;br>; &lt;hr>; &lt;div>; Get more RSS: &lt;br>; &lt;a href = &quot;https: //////////// Feedx.net &quot;style =&quot; color: orange &quot;target =&quot; _blank &quot;>; https://feedx.net &lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href =&quot; https://feedx.run &quot;style =&quot; Color: Orange &quot;target =&quot; _blank &quot;>; https://feedx.run &lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 06 Dec 2023 14:25:04 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
