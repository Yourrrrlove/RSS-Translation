Fosse had been carefully preparing for this call for ten years—after all, he had been part of the hot debate about the Nobel Prize in Literature for ten years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I was surprised, but at the same time, in a sense, I wasn&#39;t,&quot; he told Swedish public broadcaster. Fosse promised to drive home carefully. He is the most famous living playwright in the contemporary era and his works have been performed the most. He also writes prose, novels, poetry, children&#39;s literature and translation works. His works have been translated into more than fifty languages. After receiving the Nobel Prize, he complained that there would be no more big prizes to win in the future, &quot;Everything will go downhill from now on!&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Jorn Fosse was born in 1959 in Haugesund, a small town on the west coast of Norway. De, who made his debut in 1983 with the novel &quot;Red, Black&quot;, began drama creation when he was around 35 years old and completed 40 plays including adaptations in 20 years. According to The New Yorker, after a very successful and busy period working almost exclusively as a playwright, in 2012 Fother converted to Catholicism, gave up drinking, remarried, and rarely wrote plays again, &quot;writing another The idea of ​​a script no longer entertains”. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2022, John Fosse published his most important masterpiece of novels in recent years, &quot;September&quot;. This series of seven novels is written in the form of a monologue, nearly a thousand pages of stream-of-consciousness narration, with sentences never interrupted. According to the New Yorker, the narrator of &quot;Seven Parts&quot; is a painter named Asle, a convert to Catholicism who is mourning the death of his wife Ales. On Christmas Eve, Asler discovers his friend, a painter of the same name, unconscious in a Bergen alley, dying of alcohol poisoning. &quot;Their memories overlap, repeat, and gradually merge into A single voice, a vague consciousness capable of existing in many times and places simultaneously.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After winning the Nobel Prize, Fosse said in an interview that after completing &quot;Seven Parts&quot;, &quot;this announcement was expected to a certain extent.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fosse always insisted on writing in Nynorsk, a language spoken only in the western and central regions of southern Norway. Nynorsk, also known as New Norse, is a written language formed by a linguist who collected dialects from rural areas of Norway in the mid-19th century. Compared to Norway&#39;s other official language, written Norwegian, Nynorsk has a small footprint. In Norway, the first language in which students are taught is supposed to be decided by referendum in each school district, but as of 2016, only 12.2% of primary school students accepted Nynorsk as the main written language. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ninosk is a language that Fosse, who was born in the West Coast countryside, learned as a child. He attributed the award to the language itself, which he believed brought a sense of freshness. He is good at turning blank space and silence into speech, and even believes that &quot;Oriental audiences can best understand my works.&quot; Anders Olsen, chairman of the Nobel Prize Committee for Literature, mentioned in the Swedish Academy’s biography of Fosse that after completely simplifying the language and dramatic actions, Fosse used the simplest everyday language to touch human anxieties and emotions. uncertainty, and provide a profound experience of proximity to the divine. This brought him extraordinary public recognition and established him as a major innovator of contemporary theatre. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Anders listed several of Fosse&#39;s writing qualities. One of his key themes is to show, through minimalism and fragmentation, the harrowing transformations of critical moments of indecision. For example, a young mother left her apartment to take out the trash but locked herself out while her children were still inside. She needs to go get help but can&#39;t do that because she can&#39;t abandon her child. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Fosse presents situations that are immediately recognizable from our own daily lives.&quot; While in the 1995 play &quot;The Name,&quot; a pregnant young girl awaits the father of her unborn child, He was delayed. &quot;A tension is immediately built here due to this sense of uncertainty and the resulting fragmented sentences. Furthermore, these interruptions create a gap between the girl&#39;s desire for a new life with her child and her anxiety about being abandoned by her father Gully.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In &quot;Death Variation,&quot; a one-act play about a suicidal girl, Fother tells the story backwards from the girl&#39;s death. It is written in brief, staccato language by six nameless people from different eras, both living and dead. The play ends with the girl giving a moving speech from the other side of the grave, expressing a fundamental uncertainty about whether her decision to end her life was the right one. Jon Fosse considers his writing difficult to categorize, &quot;You don&#39;t read my books for the plot. But it&#39;s not because I want to be an incomprehensible writer, I never try to write in a complicated way. I always It’s about writing in a simple and—I hope—profound way.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Anders Olsen is the chairman of the Nobel Prize Committee for Literature. After the 2023 Nobel Prize in Literature was announced, Anders Olson Si received an email from a Southern Weekend reporter as scheduled. He said he was happy to be interviewed and responded within a day. However, he remained tight-lipped on some issues, such as whether the jury&#39;s decision to award the award to Jon Fother went smoothly and whether there were any other strong contenders. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The following is an exclusive interview with Anders Olsen by a reporter from Southern Weekend. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;The strongest and deepest emotions are contained in silence and pauses&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style= &quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;In the past ten years, John Fosse has been regarded as a strong contender for the Nobel Prize in Literature. When did his name enter the Nobel committee&#39;s short list? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Anders Olsen:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;For confidentiality reasons, I cannot answer this question. All I can say is that Fosse has been is a globally renowned author whose works have been widely translated since the 1990s and have been with us on the theater stage. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;On what writing qualities does the Swedish Academy pay attention to Jörn· Fother? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Anders Olsen:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Fosse wrote in a wide range of fields. He was a playwright, novelist and poet, especially his scripts and long or short narratives capture our attention. But in all this he was a poet, as he preferred to be called. You can feel it in his language processing. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;What works of Jon Fother are the main basis for the award? work? Which work does the jury consider to be his most important work? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Anders Olsen:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;We think (and Fox said so in the review) that after Fox completed his After releasing three volumes of his masterpiece, The Septology - a well-deserved achievement, this award couldn&#39;t come at a better time. This novel and more of his essays, and of course his highly innovative plays from the 1990s, are decisive for us. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;From a personal perspective, you like him Which works? What strikes you most about his writing? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Anders Olsen:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;He can make silences and pauses speak in the theater, and it is in silences and pauses that the strongest, The deepest emotion, that struck me. &quot;Somebody is going to come&quot;, &quot;Death Variations&quot; and &quot;Dream in Autumn&quot; are all wonderful plays. And in his prose, I was completely immersed in &quot;The Septology,&quot; but I especially loved &quot;Morning and Evening,&quot; a book about life written in sparkling and extremely sensitive prose. Short stories of coming and passing. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;“Give voices a special status”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family : Italics, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;The Nobel Prize for Literature was awarded to Jon Fosse: &quot;His innovative drama and prose give voice to the ineffable.&quot; Where does the jury think his innovation lies? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Anders Olsen:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Fosse is good at using silence, interruption and postponement of action to evoke deep anxiety in people. This is a striking feature of his drama. In his prose, his use of repetition and evocation is more typical. In both cases, something must be expressed that cannot be easily said. Fother does this in a very touching way. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;The word voice in the award speech , also seems intended to emphasize Fother&#39;s contribution to literary language. How do you see the connection between Fosse&#39;s literary achievements and his use of the Nynorsk language? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Anders Olsen:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;This is the first Nynorsk-language writer to win the Nobel Prize for Literature. I think his work should be read in his native language if possible, it has an unpretentious beauty and is not difficult to translate. Compared to written Norwegian, Norway&#39;s other official language, Nynorsk is more traditional, less urban and more closely related to Old Norse. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You are reading the Nynorsk version ? Are there any good translations to recommend? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Anders Olsen:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Yes, I read Fosse in Nynorsk, and it is highly recommended. I don&#39;t have much experience with translations, and both Urban Andersson and Lars Andersson&#39;s Swedish translations are excellent. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;How to understand the &quot;ineffable&quot; in Fosse&#39;s works What does it mean? He introduced his own writing ideas and quoted two sentences, one is Wittgenstein&#39;s &quot;Where there is no words, one must be silent&quot; and the other is Derrida&#39;s &quot;What cannot be said, one can only write&quot;. He thinks the latter is closer to his own ideas. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Anders Olsen:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I think both statements can be linked to Fosse&#39;s writing. In Wittgenstein&#39;s Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus, &quot;unsayable&quot; refers to the realm where we cannot formulate propositions, and it is also the realm where we can call it &quot;true&quot;. But literature, ethics, and religion do not use propositions; they belong precisely to the realm of the unsayable. Derrida does not have the same strict standard of truth as Wittgenstein. On the contrary, his &quot;saying&quot; gives writing a special position, which coincides with Fosse. Paradoxically, Fother&#39;s writing gave voice a special status, especially in his dramatic works. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Eon Fother believes that he has the greatest influence His writers include Tarje Wessos, the Austrian poets Georg Trakl and Samuel Beckett, and the ones he most admires are Kafka and Knut. Knut Hamsun. How do you think these writers influenced him? What were Fosse&#39;s own innovations? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Anders Olsen: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;It’s hard to give a short answer. Fother has a negative worldview in the Gnostic sense (Gnostic (ancient Greek philosophy, which believes that the material world is evil and can only be saved through &quot;spiritual knowledge&quot;)), which is very close to Beckett. The most important thing is the use of negation and questions. Fosse&#39;s play bears a striking resemblance to Waiting for Godot, but this does not lead him to nihilism. There was in Fosse a faith that Beckett did not have and a kind of passive mysticism, like that of Meister Eckhart, which appears in the Heptalogy. 》 is very obvious. I won’t talk about other writers. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;“It’s very difficult to give a great Fosse performance”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style= &quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You think the uniqueness of Fosse&#39;s writing lies in the fact that after completely simplifying language and dramatic actions, he uses simple daily life scenes to express human beings&#39; strongest anxiety and powerlessness. A lot of writers can do this, what’s so special about Fosse? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Anders Olsen:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;A certain strange confidence, almost childlike self-confidence, and a gentle humor in the negativity. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;In the interview after the award, you said you were blessed Ser&#39;s work touches on common human &quot;anxieties, insecurities, and thoughts about life and death.&quot; This is easily reminiscent of the unease that pervades the world. Are there any practical considerations in awarding the award to Fosse at this time? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Anders Olsen: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;You are always influenced by what is happening in the contemporary world, but I don’t think it is the decisive factor. Fosse is always with us. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Have you seen his plays on stage? ’s performance? How is it different from reading a script? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Anders Olsen:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;It needs to be pointed out that Fosse&#39;s dramatic works are extremely readable. But this is not always the case. In addition, due to Fosse&#39;s special language and less stage scenery, it is very difficult to give a wonderful Fosse performance on the stage. Please read his work first and then perform your own mental show! &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Why is the award given to a playwright? Although Jon Fosse is one of the most well-known playwrights in the contemporary theater world, compared with the popular candidates in the eyes of the outside world, such as Salman Rushdie and Margaret Atwood, this choice will not be the same. Will there be some niche? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Anders Olsen: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;For us it is of course important to focus on drama. Harold Pinter received this honor over twenty years ago and I think now is the time. Interestingly, Fosse also translated Pinter&#39;s work. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;In 2014, Fother accepted an interview with the British &quot;Guardian&quot; &quot;In an interview, he said that the Nobel Prize in Literature is usually awarded to very old writers. &quot;You will get it when it does not affect your writing.&quot; Coincidentally, Fosse rarely writes for the theater now. Last year, he told the New Yorker that he wanted to take a break after writing &quot;Seven Parts&quot; and that he is now very interested in literary translation. Does winning the award at this time confirm his previous views? Is this a &quot;lifetime achievement award&quot;? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Anders Olsen:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I think it can be regarded as a &quot;lifetime achievement award&quot;, just like Peter Handke (2019 Winner of the 2016 Nobel Prize for Literature) won the same award. Of course, this isn&#39;t always the case. In both cases, it is also important to note that they achieved great things before winning the award. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;This year Chinese writer Can Xue ranked in the British bookmaker Nicer It ranked first in the odds list on the Odds website, attracting enthusiastic attention from the Chinese people. How did the jury respond to the possibility of Can Xue winning? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Anders Olsen:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;For our confidentiality reasons, I cannot answer this question. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;In my opinion, the Nobel Prize for Literature Giving to the so-called unpopular outstanding writers is a promotion of literature. Do you think that influence is declining? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Anders Olsen: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;No. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 09 Oct 2023 12:55:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[706名缅北电诈犯罪嫌疑人分三批移交我方]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258285]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-09 11:26:07&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;In view of the severe situation of telecommunications network fraud crimes involving China in northern Myanmar, the Yunnan Public Security Bureau continues to strengthen its cooperation with Myanmar-related local law enforcement departments border police cooperation and continued to carry out multiple rounds of crackdowns. Recently, based on the remarkable results achieved in the previous work, the crackdown has achieved another major result. 497 telecommunications network fraud suspects were handed over to the Lincang Public Security Bureau in two batches, and 209 telecommunications network fraud suspects were handed over to the Pu&#39;er Public Security Bureau. Among them, online There are 26 people at large, which has effectively dealt a blow to the arrogance of overseas fraudsters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since September this year, the public security agencies in Xishuangbanna, Pu&#39;er and other places in Yunnan have carried out border police law enforcement cooperation with relevant local law enforcement departments in Myanmar. A large number of overseas fraud dens have been successfully eradicated, and a large number of telecommunications network fraud suspects have been successfully eradicated. The person was handed over to us. In order to continue to build momentum and advance the crackdown in depth, under the command and deployment of the Yunnan Provincial Public Security Department, the Pu&#39;er Public Security Bureau further expanded its results. 209 telecommunications network fraud suspects were successfully handed over to us on October 1. At the same time, Lincang Public Security Bureau&#39;s border police law enforcement cooperation has made significant progress. The relevant local law enforcement departments in Myanmar handed over 497 telecommunications network fraud suspects to us in two batches on September 25 and October 7 respectively. This is another important breakthrough made by the Yunnan public security agencies in border police cooperation, following the Xishuangbanna and Puer public security agencies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At present, relevant criminal suspects have been detained by public security organs in Inner Mongolia, Heilongjiang, Zhejiang, Anhui, Fujian, Henan, Chongqing and other places involved in the case. The public security organs will thoroughly investigate all the facts of his crimes, and while cracking down on fraud crimes in accordance with the law, they will also dig deep into related crimes such as black and gray products in the country to ensure that the entire chain is cracked down and severely punished in accordance with the law. After continuous and effective crackdowns, 2,317 suspects of telecommunications and cyber fraud in northern Myanmar have been successfully captured and handed over to us, including 23 behind-the-scenes &quot;financiers&quot;, organizational leaders and backbones, and 94 online fugitives, a powerful squeeze This has reduced the living space for overseas fraudsters, and the number of telecom network fraud cases across the country has recently shown a significant downward trend. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The relevant person in charge of the public security agency stated that the telecommunications network fraud crimes involving China in northern Myanmar mainly involve fraud types such as bill rebates, fake online investment and financial management, fake reseller logistics customer service, fake online loans, etc. The general public is advised to be careful Be vigilant, enhance your ability to detect and prevent fraud, and beware of being deceived. The public security organs will continue to keep a close eye on telecom network fraud criminal groups in northern Myanmar, continue to deepen border police cooperation, continue to organize special crackdown operations, make every effort to clear out fraud dens, arrest fraud personnel in accordance with the law, continue to expand the results of operations, and resolutely protect the people.

I wrote an article about an interview with a girl who quoted a poem called &quot;The Book of Songs: Biyang&quot; to express her desire to work hard. But there is no poem called &quot;Beyond the Sun&quot; in the &quot;Book of Songs&quot;. The forged poem is all homophonic. It is written in seemingly elegant words, but when read out it is full of swear words. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This editor has probably not done any real interviews or face-to-face conversations. The swearing in this poem is so obvious that you can hear it right away. However, if you think of looking for materials in the Book of Songs, this idea is correct. The function of the &quot;Ode&quot; part in &quot;The Book of Songs&quot; is traditionally believed to be &quot;to describe the beauty and virtue, and to report success to the gods&quot;. Although the gods no longer believe in them today, the Book of Songs is still the highest example of how to declare success, speak solemnly but not rigidly, and be elegant but not pretentious. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, although &quot;Beyond the Sun&quot; is fake, and it only plays homophonic jokes, it is not considered clever, and it is &quot;joking and sadizing&quot;. But the poem seems to mean one thing, but actually it means another thing. It is also within the cultural context represented by the Book of Songs. There are so-called &quot;changing style&quot; and &quot;changing elegance&quot; in &quot;The Book of Songs&quot;, which pays great attention to this technique. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Daya·Dang&quot; repeatedly emphasized, &quot;King Wen said to consult, and the daughter of the Yin Shang Dynasty was consulted.&quot; King Wen of Zhou couldn&#39;t help but sigh. What he sighed was the fate of the Shang Dynasty, and then he mentioned Shang Zhou in the poem. The various atrocities committed by the king were listed in detail and criticized repeatedly. The last sentence of the poem is the famous &quot;Yin Jian is not far away, in the time of Queen Xia&quot;. Shang Zhou wanted to know his own ending, and the mirror was at hand, it was Xia Jie. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some people have always emphasized that Shang Zhou was vilified by the Zhou people. The reason is that subsequent dynasties must vilify the previous dynasty&#39;s subjugated king, otherwise it will not be enough to establish their own legitimacy. It cannot be said that this reason does not exist, but the poem &quot;Dang&quot; was obviously not written for this purpose. This poem was written during the Western Zhou Dynasty. The author was clearly criticizing Shang Zhou, but his actual intention was to criticize King Li of Zhou. Firstly, the artillery fire was not directed at King Li of Zhou Dynasty, but was rebounded by Shang Zhou; secondly, it was not the poet who fired the artillery fire like this, but King Wen of Zhou Dynasty. The foundation of this dynasty was created by King Wen. As a descendant of King Wen, can you still oppose him? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Book of Songs&quot; initiated this tradition of borrowing from the past to satirize the present. Confucius especially emphasized to his disciples that they must study &quot;The Book of Songs&quot; carefully. Naturally, later generations of Confucian scholars played this trick very well. Why did Qin Shihuang burn poems and books? Just because &quot;Poetry&quot; is indeed an excellent teaching material that reflects the past and the present. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The author of &quot;Dang&quot; was probably an important minister in the Western Zhou Dynasty. Traditionally, it is believed that he was Duke Zhaomu who pointed out that &quot;it is better to guard against the people&#39;s mouth than to guard against the river&quot;. At least it is reasonable. Most people can&#39;t talk about such advanced topics, but they also have a technique for venting their resentment through poetry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Those who have not read &quot;The Book of Songs&quot; have probably heard that &quot;under the sky, is it the king&#39;s land, and on the shore of the land, is it the king&#39;s ministers&quot;, and then judging based on intuition, they will also think this sentence The majestic praise comes from the official propaganda of the Western Zhou Dynasty. It cannot be ruled out that this sentence was originally propaganda. However, we can read this sentence today because the author of &quot;Xiaoya·Beishan&quot; was a small civil servant in the Zhou Dynasty. These four sentences are followed by two sentences: &quot;Doctors are not equal.&quot; , I am engaged in being an independent scholar.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The six sentences strung together mean: The world is the king&#39;s land, and the land is the king&#39;s ministers. The leadership is really unfair, and the burden is heavy on me. ——Xian means more. It probably means that those who are capable work hard, and the boss assigned all the work to the author. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The following section of &quot;Beishan&quot; elaborates on how uneven the work of this department is: some people &quot;sleep in bed&quot;, which is a more elegant way of saying &quot;lying down&quot;; some people &quot;don&#39;t know how to call&quot; , no matter how miserable the people are, it’s none of my business, I’ll just do it if I can; some people are “Qi Chi Yan Yang” and will definitely be late for work and will definitely leave early after work; some people are “Zhan Le Drinker” and indulge in drinking and having fun; &quot;Come in and out of the discussion&quot;, and the reason for going to work is to talk loudly. If there are more people like this, the work will naturally be particularly miserable. He &quot;does not do anything extravagantly&quot; and is &quot;miserably afraid of blame.&quot; The more he does, the more blame he will bear. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This poem pursues the effect of a majestic slogan that seamlessly connects with the fly camp and the dog dog below. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If you turn two pages back in &quot;Beishan&quot;, you will read another song called &quot;Xiao Ming&quot;. ——There is a poem in &quot;The Book of Songs·Daya&quot;, the first sentence is &quot;Mingming is down&quot;, and there is a poem in &quot;Xiaoya&quot;, the first sentence is &quot;Mingming is going to heaven&quot;. So the song in &quot;Daya&quot; is called &quot;Da Ming&quot;, and the song in &quot;Xiao Ya&quot; is called &quot;Xiao Ming&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xiao Ming said: &quot;I have passed away in the past, and the sun and the moon are gone. Will the clouds return? There will be no clouds in the year.&quot; I came to work after the Chinese New Year. When can I go home? In the blink of an eye. It&#39;s the end of the year. &quot;I miss me alone, and I am a common man. I am worried, and I am afraid that I will not have enough time.&quot; I miss me alone, and the more things I do, the more busy I am. I feel really sad, and I am afraid that I will never be able to finish my work. &quot;Thinking of our common people, caring deeply for them! Don&#39;t you want to return home? I&#39;m afraid of the punishment and anger.&quot; I miss my family, I really do. &quot;Don&#39;t you want to return home? I&#39;m afraid of this wrath.&quot; Does it mean that I don&#39;t want to go home? I&#39;m afraid of being scolded by my boss. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The last chapter of &quot;Xiao Ming&quot; especially demonstrates the skill of converting grievances into official language:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Sigh, gentlemen, I will never rest in peace.&quot; In fact, it is talking about you stewards Yeah, don&#39;t get too comfortable. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Jing shares your position&quot;, please stay in your position. The implication is that when I report the work and ask you to make a decision, don&#39;t be unable to find someone. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;The good thing is integrity.&quot; You have to be an upright person. In fact, it means being a kind person and approving what should be approved. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;God listens to you, and you will be blessed.&quot; God is also watching you. Don&#39;t make things difficult for others, and you will be rewarded with blessings. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Well, after more than two thousand years, Xiao Ming is still Xiao Ming. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 09 Oct 2023 10:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[中国光大集团原党委书记、董事长李晓鹏被“双开”]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258279]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-09 10:07:33&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;With the approval of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection and the State Supervision Commission investigated Li Xiaopeng, former Party Secretary and Chairman of China Everbright Group Co., Ltd.

However, on September 22, the environmental organization Institute for the Public and Environmental Affairs (IPE) released &quot;Suspicious Clouds about the Carbon Neutrality of Apple Products&quot; (hereinafter referred to as &quot;Suspicious Clouds&quot;), questioning Apple&#39;s lack of information on the use of clean electricity and carbon offsets for carbon-neutral products. Adequate disclosure and explanation, and failure to push suppliers to disclose factory-level carbon data. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On September 28, Apple responded to Southern Weekend reporters, promising to share strategies and progress, and responded to some details. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;carbon neutral&quot; label has been controversial for a long time. Carbon neutrality simply means that greenhouse gas emissions can be offset. After companies save energy and reduce emissions themselves, they often offset carbon emissions by purchasing “carbon credits” (such as forest carbon sinks). However, recently Nestlé, Gucci, easyJet and other companies have announced their withdrawal from the carbon offset market, and the third-party consulting company Carbon Trust will no longer provide carbon neutral label certification from September 2023. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Behind the controversy is the increasingly common practice of &quot;greenwashing&quot; - companies exaggerating their environmental protection behavior and misleading consumers into believing it is true. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To prevent greenwashing, many interviewees told Southern Weekend reporters that the key is &quot;openness.&quot; However, there is currently no consensus on the granularity of carbon neutral product information disclosure, and standards need to be unified. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Europe has taken the lead. France has put forward mandatory information disclosure requirements for “carbon neutrality”-related publicity. The EU reached a provisional political agreement on September 19, 2023. If it cannot provide proof, &quot;climate neutral&quot;, &quot;nature&#39;s friend&quot;, &quot;biodegradable&quot; and &quot;ecological&quot; Eco)&quot; and other labels will be prohibited. If passed, this agreement will take effect in 2026. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The six industry insiders interviewed by Southern Weekend reporters had relatively consistent views. They both affirmed that Apple’s information disclosure on its first carbon-neutral product is remarkable, and at the same time believed that there is room for improvement. Regarding IPE’s doubts, half of the respondents agreed that Apple needs to further disclose information on clean electricity use and carbon offsets. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Apple’s level of data management and disclosure of suppliers leads the world, but it still needs to fully prove whether it has gone all out to achieve product carbon neutrality.” Founder of Climate Futures, &quot;Carbon Neutral&quot; &quot;Times&quot; author Wang Jun said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/07/jM1wpQhW07Op9WGsVGUG1fvHbtcFiggO5v2c38y6.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;639&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/07/jM1wpQhW07Op9WGsVGUG1fvHbtcFiggO5v2c38y6.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253292&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On September 12, 2023 local time, the new Apple Watch was on display in California, USA. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;What the first carbon neutral product disclosed&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt; p>;How does Apple Watch become carbon neutral? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the first year of announcing that its products were carbon neutral, Apple played a creative advertisement called &quot;Mother Nature&quot; at the press conference and on social platforms - Apple CEO Cook and others paid tribute to &quot;Mother Nature&quot; &quot;Mother&quot; reported on environmental protection work. The environmental report of the latest product was also published on the official website, disclosing the carbon footprint of the carbon-neutral Apple Watch. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Take the carbon-neutral model of Apple Watch Ultra 2 as an example: the baseline carbon emission is 63.2kg, and after the carbon emission is reduced by 81%, it is reduced to 12kg. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;81% of carbon reduction starts from materials, electricity, transportation and other aspects: the weight of recycled materials accounts for more than 30%; 100% clean electricity is used; 50% and above product logistics are transported by non-air transport. The remaining 12kg of emissions are offset using carbon credits from the Restore Fund project. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/07/hPC956MeD0XOs6ChYcF3UQgWM84eRnMypDAreBcP.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;928&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/07/hPC956MeD0XOs6ChYcF3UQgWM84eRnMypDAreBcP.png&quot; data-key=&quot;253291&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Carbon emission data of Apple Watch Ultra 2 carbon neutral model. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Apple official website, IPE compilation/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporter learned from Apple that after drastically reducing product emissions, Apple has to deal with the current situation. High-quality carbon credits based on nature projects will only be used where solutions cannot yet avoid or reduce emissions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Shi Han, director of the ESG Center at the China Business School of the University of Hong Kong, told Southern Weekend reporters that Apple has adopted a clear and strict product carbon reduction method, giving priority to reducing the three largest emission sources in the product life cycle - electricity, Materials and Shipping. But he also suggested that Apple could refer to the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) requirements for setting corporate net-zero standards, carry out the product carbon neutrality process, and strive to achieve a carbon reduction of no less than 90%. emissions, and then look for ways to offset carbon emissions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among various global initiatives related to combating climate change, SBTi is known for its strictness and is consistent with the Paris Agreement&#39;s efforts to achieve a temperature control path of 1.5°C&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: italics, italics _GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(For details, please see Southern Weekend&#39;s report&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.infzm.com/content/258230&quot;>;&quot;More than 100 companies have been &quot;publicly delisted&quot;.

Southern Weekend reporters found out that Apple has also joined SBTi. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;81% mentioned that 90% is not without space. Wang Jun told Southern Weekend reporters that although Apple explained its progress in reducing emissions in materials, electricity, and transportation, it lacked comparison with its peers and failed to demonstrate whether it had reached its own emission reduction limits, such as 50% non-air transport. Logistics and 30% recycled materials, why can’t the ratio be higher? &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;How to prove&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;100%&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;use of clean electricity&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In Apple’s carbon emission reduction path, Clean electricity contributes the most. How to confirm that 100% clean electricity is used in the production process of Apple products is the first question of &quot;Suspicious Cloud&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Data collected by IPE through different channels show that some of Apple’s suppliers’ carbon emissions have only declined slightly, while some are even still growing. &quot;Suspicion&quot; raised concerns that the proportion of clean electricity actually used by these suppliers is very limited, resulting in double-counting - claiming to allocate clean electricity to Apple, but actually allocating it to other brands. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liao Xun, chief sustainability expert of Quantis, an environmental sustainability consulting company, also believes that the supply chain of electronic products involves multiple layers of suppliers, and it is relatively easy to require first-tier suppliers, but second- to fourth-tier suppliers Suppliers are difficult to control. Without disclosing the proportion of renewable energy, it is difficult to prove that suppliers at all levels use 100% clean electricity to produce Apple products. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this regard, Southern Weekend reporters learned from Apple that Apple closely monitors, reviews and verifies the data submitted by suppliers every year, and hires a third party to conduct independent reviews of suppliers’ clean energy plan methods to track and verify suppliers’ clean energy contributions and provide assurance on reported data. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In response to interview questions such as double counting, SCS Global Services (hereinafter referred to as SCS), a third-party company that provides carbon neutrality certification for Apple, told Southern Weekend reporters, &quot;We will not provide non-public information about our customers to the media. information&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Suspicious Cloud&quot; also believes that according to data disclosed by Apple, 24% of the more than 250 suppliers that have committed to using renewable electricity to produce Apple products are unable to purchase through on-site renewable electricity or renewable energy. To achieve clean electricity substitution, you need to purchase renewable energy certificates. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ma Jun, founder of the Institute of Public and Environmental Affairs (IPE), said that the use and procurement of clean electricity in foundries is quite complicated. Many of them are not directly connected to renewable energy, but through the purchase of green power or green certificates. Achieve carbon emission reductions. In this case, how to distribute the limited green power among its different product lines becomes the key. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Apple responded to a Southern Weekend reporter saying that newly committed suppliers will need some time to obtain clean energy solutions, so some of the clean energy already committed in the Apple Watch supply chain has not yet been put into operation. In the interim, Apple has used its own renewable energy projects to close the gap, reducing the electricity footprint of manufacturing the Apple Watch to zero. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/07/oPvV6ckNV7gVCA15OIB0hUt2r2x56wnMeiu6J5MY.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/07/oPvV6ckNV7gVCA15OIB0hUt2r2x56wnMeiu6J5MY.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253295&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On September 27, 2023, local time, Denmark, Apple CEO Tim Cook (right) and Apple&#39;s head of sustainability Lisa Jackson (middle), CEO of European Energy Company Erik Anderse, behind the solar panels that power Apple&#39;s data centers in Europe. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Concentrate resources on one product line&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;? &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Suppliers often serve multiple customers.

However, no details were given on the project. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Apple&#39;s &quot;2023 Environmental Progress Report&quot; released in April 2023 shows that the Restore Fund will be jointly launched by Apple, Conservation International and Goldman Sachs in 2021.

Shi Han believes that Apple’s first carbon-neutral product report did not disclose the specific details of the carbon offset projects it used, such as project type, location, quantity and price. This makes it difficult for outsiders to assess the quality and effectiveness of its carbon offsets. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On September 28, 2023, Southern Weekend reporters obtained six carbon neutrality certificates for Apple Watch straps and watches from SCS.

The Mayo Forest Conservation Project and the REDD+ project in the Kaiuru Mountains region in southeastern Kenya include a basic description of the project, year, repayment amount, and the project&#39;s registration link with Verra, a third-party carbon credit verification agency. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Regarding the Restore Fund, you can currently check the location, planning, start time and other specific information of a completed project - Forestal Apepu on the Verra official website. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ma Jun said that Apple’s response to demands and disclosure of carbon neutrality certificates to the public is a step worthy of recognition. However, the current carbon neutral certificates still lack specific information on carbon credits. Now that carbon neutral products have been promoted and marketed, more detailed information on carbon offset projects should be disclosed to the public in a timely manner. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Suspicious Cloud&quot; cited the PAS2060 carbon neutrality standard issued by the British Standards Institute (BSI). When companies submit applications for carbon neutrality verification to verification agencies, they should submit the amount, type, and issuance time of carbon offsets. , validity period, cancellation date, etc. Although the PAS2060 standard does not require companies to disclose the above information to the public, Ma Jun believes that there is currently a lot of controversy over carbon-neutral products internationally, and it is necessary to review and improve the current standards, improve data disclosure requirements, and build a publicly verifiable chain of evidence. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Data Disclosure&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Granularity&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Dispute&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Ma Jun believes that the best way to resolve disputes is The way is to fully disclose carbon data to society. However, &quot;Suspicion&quot; pointed out that Apple &quot;has regressed in its position on environmental information disclosure.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since 2014, IPE has successively launched the &quot;Green Supply Chain CITI Index&quot; and &quot;Corporate Climate Action CATI Index&quot; to evaluate the environmental management performance of brands in China&#39;s supply chain. Apple has ranked among the best for many years in a row, becoming a CITI &quot;Outstanding Brand&quot; &quot;one. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2023, the IPE carbon disclosure platform will be officially launched. Companies need to change the way they submit carbon data. IPE has repeatedly confirmed with Apple about changes in its disclosure policy, hoping that Apple will push suppliers to fill in the disclosure form, and Apple told IPE that “suppliers will not be required to disclose factory-level carbon data to the public.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to this, IPE suspects that Apple has &quot;regressed.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Apple has had several rounds of communication with IPE. &quot;Suspicion&quot; published Apple&#39;s email in response to IPE. Apple stated that &quot;there has been no regression in the requirement for suppliers to report carbon emissions to Apple&quot; and &quot;we continue to encourage suppliers. Publicly disclose its Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, participate in IPE’s initiatives, and advocate for transparency.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporters learned from various sources that both IPE and Apple support the disclosure of carbon data by suppliers. The difference lies in the granularity of disclosure. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;IPE encourages companies to disclose factory-level data. &quot;Some supplier groups have many factories, and some are even distributed around the world. If we only publish data at the supplier group level, it cannot be mapped to specific factories, and we cannot clearly judge the emission reduction progress of actual OEM factories.&quot; Ma Jun explained. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Apple encourages suppliers to disclose carbon data at the company level rather than at the factory level. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Apple responded to a Southern Weekend reporter saying that the most impactful action suppliers can take to combat climate change is to transition to renewable energy. Because this positive impact (of supplier access to renewable energy) spans regions and potentially many plant sites, it is best measured at the company level, with renewable projects additive and localized to the same grid where manufacturing operations occur. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;factory level&quot; data also involves disputes over whether it is a trade secret. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Guan Weijia, general manager of Guangzhou Jie Carbon Technology Co., Ltd., a comprehensive dual-carbon service provider, told Southern Weekend reporters that carbon data is associated with many core confidential data, and companies have the right to disclose and share such data. There are also trade-offs necessary, and gaps in some data are understandable. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If only third-party organizations can obtain and verify corporate carbon-neutral product data, it will be difficult for other relevant parties to verify it. Ma Jun believes that in the process of promoting carbon-neutral products, Apple should not &quot;outsource&quot; its disclosure responsibilities to third-party organizations that do not have the right to disclose. Unless a third-party organization is authorized to disclose on its behalf, &quot;pollution and carbon emission data should not be Classified as commercial secrets, disclosure is the principle and non-disclosure should only be the exception. The starting point to curb climate greenwashing must be, and can only be, comprehensive and complete information disclosure. At a time when the concept of carbon neutrality is widely controversial, we hope Seeing publicly proven carbon neutral products emerge on the market.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“What needs to be acknowledged is that the current basis and standards for accurate inventory of carbon emission data in the manufacturing industry are still not rigorous and complete enough. It is normal to be questioned, and doubts will also help promote the development and progress of the entire carbon industry. Guan Weijia said. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Should we first create a carbon-neutral product? &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;It is also controversial whether to first create a carbon-neutral product. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Shi Han believes that choosing a product to achieve carbon neutrality throughout the life cycle is a key start for companies to gradually achieve carbon neutrality for all products. But he also pointed out that when consumers buy Apple Watch, they may not know which combinations are carbon neutral - because only when they choose a specific watch and strap combination can they meet the requirements. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Jun also holds a similar view. Through the carbon neutrality pilot demonstration of Apple Watch, Apple can run through the process and help achieve the goal of carbon neutrality for all products in 2030. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liao Xun opposed it. He believes that there is nothing wrong with running through the internal process, but it is not appropriate to market the concept of &quot;product carbon neutrality&quot; at this stage. Carbon neutrality practices by companies are completely different from promoting carbon neutrality in products. The former is an action taken by companies out of social responsibility, while the latter is a market behavior directly facing consumers. “When carbon neutrality standards have not yet been perfected, companies Self-declared carbon neutrality has no practical significance and will face the risk of &#39;greenwashing&#39;.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ma Jun said that the carbon neutral label is controversial internationally, and some stakeholders have begun to formulate more stringent requirements. Under the condition that relevant standards need to be improved, companies that label their products with carbon-neutral labels have the responsibility to support green marketing through comprehensive information disclosure to avoid misleading consumers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Apple’s carbon neutral green logo is five eye-catching green leaves, but some companies have indicated that they will abandon the carbon neutral label. For example, in May 2023, Evian posted on its website that Evian was proud of the Carbon Trust certification it had obtained, but would not seek re-certification on a global scale. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In September 2023, the Carbon Trust also announced that it would no longer provide carbon neutral label certification. The Carbon Trust is headquartered in the UK and has more than 20 years of consulting and certification experience. In 2007, it released the world&#39;s first carbon label based on product carbon footprint certification. Zhao Lijian, president of Carbon Trust China, told Southern Weekend reporters that &quot;carbon neutral labels are still in high demand around the world. The cancellation of carbon neutral labels is not because Evian or other companies will no longer continue to use them,&quot; but because &quot;the market is constantly changing.&quot; To support local development, more ambitious carbon labels need to be provided.” The updated label was well thought out and not a hasty cancellation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhao Lijian said that consumers hope that companies will take more active and transparent climate actions. The Carbon Trust’s updated carbon label no longer emphasizes carbon neutrality to avoid consumers mistakenly thinking that products have no carbon emissions or zero emissions. Instead, the focus is on carbon reduction and product carbon footprint comparisons. For example, the carbon reduction label will show how much the product&#39;s carbon footprint has been reduced through emission reduction measures compared with before; the low-carbon label will list: the carbon emissions of this product are lower than similar products of the same company; or the carbon emissions of this product are lower than similar products on the market Products are lower. Labels also display more comprehensive information via URL/QR code. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“We should face the issue of carbon neutrality with more humility, recognize the complexity behind successfully achieving carbon neutrality, and face up to the difficulties.” Ma Jun said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 09 Oct 2023 09:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[钱伟长 最厉害的偏科生丨那年今日]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258236]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-09 08:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 09 Oct 2023 08:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[把家庭财产、公司财产洗为个人财产？拆解三种洗钱类型]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258204]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-08 23:45:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Beijing TV station&#39;s &quot;Rule of Law in Progress&quot; column reported such a case, from free to high fees, over the New Year Ms. Chen, who was in her sixties, couldn&#39;t help being &quot;fooled&quot; again and again in a medical beauty institution in Haidian District, Beijing. She made 370 transfers in just 10 months, spending a total of 5.44 million yuan on beauty care, and even some The consumption in a single day reached 790,000 yuan, which consumed all the family’s savings and the life-saving money of my wife and children. The news triggered heated discussions, with some netizens asking, &quot;Is such an abnormal move suspected of transferring family assets?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Judging from the report, on the one hand, the medical beauty institution first claimed that it was free, and then gradually Ms. Chen introduced a fee-based item, and the sales consultant even said that he could &quot;help advance payment&quot; of part of the expenses and was unable to provide relevant medical records. This was indeed a violation of regulations. However, on the other hand, Ms. Chen knew that her husband was suffering from cancer, so she actually transferred the medical expenses and the entire family&#39;s expenses. He invested all his savings into it, but his behavior is also strange. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The money at home cannot be used by either spouse as they wish. In 2022, the People&#39;s Court of Fangshan District, Beijing heard a divorce case. My wife loves beauty and other high-end purchases, and has squandered all the family savings of 600,000 yuan. After trial, the court held that the 600,000 yuan deposit involved in the case was the husband and wife&#39;s business income and was the joint property of the husband and wife. Both spouses have equal rights to dispose of common property, but when exercising the right to dispose of common property, one spouse should adhere to the principles of moderation, rationality and prudence, use it reasonably and standardizedly, and must not be squandered or damage the property rights of the spouse. In this case, the court protected the part where the wife exercised her right of reasonable disposal. The part where excessive consumption was done without the consent of the spouse, was not for the purpose of daily household expenses, and was squandering, which infringed upon the property rights of the spouse. In the end, the court ruled that the woman should pay her ex-husband 200,000 yuan in compensation for her deposit. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Based on this reasoning, Ms. Chen spent more than 5 million yuan in family savings and her husband’s medical expenses on “exorbitantly expensive beauty treatments”, which is also suspected of harming her husband’s property rights. It is worth noting that the above report also mentioned a detail, &quot;The medical beauty institution gave a consumption details. Among them, there are many discrepancies between the total consumption amount, consumption records and the transfer details transferred by the bank.&quot; The actual expenditure It is inconsistent with the accounts. Are the relevant funds used for beauty expenses, or are they transferring family assets in the name of beauty? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As relevant departments intensify their publicity on &quot;anti-money laundering&quot;, the public has become aware of its concept. Money laundering is essentially the act of disguising, concealing, and transforming illegal assets or other assets that do not belong to individuals in various ways to make them legal in form. It can be roughly divided into three types: laundering family assets into personal assets, Criminal gangs or corrupt officials use their money to launder and turn company assets into their own. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the above-mentioned &quot;sky-high price beauty&quot; case, the onlookers lamented the greed and foolishness of the person involved in &quot;spending thousands of dollars for beauty&quot;. Perhaps some people&#39;s abnormal behavior is just in response to the old saying &quot;Others laugh at me for being crazy, but I laugh at others because they can&#39;t see through it.&quot; In the name of large consumption, they convert family property into personal property. Once the subsequent marriage relationship changes, , and preparations are made for property cutting. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are many ways to &quot;launder&quot; family assets into personal assets. For example, use the joint funds of the couple to buy valuable jewelry and put it in their own names; regularly give a large amount of &quot;red envelopes&quot; to their parents, and then ask their parents to transfer the money into their own accounts; and so on. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The whitewashing of funds with unknown future is common among corrupt officials, criminal gangs, etc. Corrupt officials clean up their corruption gains by investing in companies, purchasing art, and even regularly giving their children huge amounts of living expenses. Public officials use overseas companies to inflate the import price when importing equipment and raw materials, then receive huge kickbacks from them, and then keep the illegal gains abroad. This not only makes public funds their own, but also realizes the transfer of assets overseas. . Public officials can also use &quot;white gloves&quot; to set up shell companies to invest overseas, that is, first set up shell companies abroad, then use their powers to provide various conveniences, and finally remit domestic income abroad in the form of overseas investment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Criminal gangs launder illegal gains into legitimate gains through investments in film and television dramas, virtual currency transactions, etc. There are criminal gangs that are linked to casinos, convert cash into tokens in casinos, and then deliver the tokens directly to the beneficiaries of the money laundering. Then he will exchange the tokens back into cash (usually requiring a handling fee of about 5%), and he can claim to have won the money by gambling in the casino. This avoids directly tracing the beneficiary of money laundering through the serial number on the banknote. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to the above two methods of money laundering, rich people complete the transfer of company assets to personal assets by purchasing overseas bonds issued by their own companies abroad and then using their authority to pay them first. For example, a company may be in debt due to poor business operations and face bankruptcy. As the actual controller of the company, the rich people let the company issue US dollar bonds with annual interest rates as high as ten percent or even higher, and then the rich people subscribed in large quantities. In this way, the rich man, as the actual controller of the company, theoretically only has limited liability within the scope of equity. It is the company&#39;s business to pay off its debts. In this way, through &quot;due process&quot;, the company was hollowed out, Jin Chan escaped from the shell, converted the company&#39;s assets into personal assets, and then took his family and children to enjoy the rest of his life abroad. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 09 Oct 2023 00:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[男子持刀列车上杀人，广铁集团通报]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258276]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-09 00:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;After review by judicial authorities, it was found that on the evening of May 4, passenger He used a black folding knife (blade) About 10.5 cm long) was hidden behind a belt buckle.
