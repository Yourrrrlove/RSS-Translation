The Huaxian Municipal Supervision Bureau issued a situation report on November 1, saying that law enforcement officers did not interpret the policy in a standardized manner, causing misunderstandings, and suspended them. However, this report was vague about the nature of the incident, which aroused greater doubts among netizens. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to netizens, they were preparing to have a dinner in their yard when several law enforcement officers suddenly arrived. In the video, a uniformed staff member said, &quot;As long as you set up a fire, it is considered a business. If you have a group dinner, you must apply for a food safety license and a food business license. If you do not apply, you will be fined.&quot; Faced with doubts from netizens, law enforcement officers Take out a copy of the Food Safety Law and indicate that there is a legal basis for requesting a certificate. This aroused great doubts among netizens. Many people commented under the video: &quot;Do I need a permit to cook at home?&quot; &quot;I invited some relatives to my house for dinner a few days ago and didn&#39;t apply for a permit. Is it illegal?&quot; &quot; I plan to invite a few friends to my home for dinner in the next few days. Where can I apply for a certificate?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After becoming a hot spot on the Internet, the Huaxian Municipal Supervision Bureau reported that on October 17, the bureau received a report that a certain village There was a dinner party in a courtyard. After the law enforcement officers arrived at the scene, they &quot;found that this was not a normal wedding and wedding gathering in rural areas. Five people were preparing dishes and cleaning tableware on the scene. The processing environment was simple and open-air. There were no &#39;three prevention&#39; facilities. The operators did not hold valid health certificates. There were Serious safety hazards can easily lead to food safety incidents and endanger people&#39;s health. Law enforcement officers explained relevant laws and regulations to the above-mentioned personnel and persuaded them to stop processing behaviors.&quot; &quot;During the law enforcement process, law enforcement officers did not interpret the policy in a standardized manner, which caused The masses misunderstood. The comrade was ordered to make an in-depth inspection and be suspended from duty.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To be honest, this announcement is confusing. The previous paragraph seems to say that law enforcement is no problem. It’s just that law enforcement officers’ interpretation of the policy is not standardized enough. If that&#39;s the case, it&#39;s just a small mistake and doesn&#39;t warrant suspension, right? Just criticize and educate, and then learn standardized policy interpretations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But if I read the first paragraph carefully, the more I read, the more confused I become. The scene was &quot;not a normal wedding and wedding gathering.&quot; What kind of dinner was that? Is it normal to gather for weddings and weddings, but is it abnormal to gather for other gatherings? Do we need a certificate for “normal” weddings and weddings? Or is it only needed for “abnormal” dinner parties? What kind of dinner party is this? How many people are at the dinner party? Are the five people preparing food on site also part of the party, or are they the chefs they hired? The answers to these questions are different, and the nature of the events may be completely different. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If this is just a dinner party between family and friends, and the person preparing the food is also part of the dinner party, then there is absolutely no reason for the so-called law enforcement. If you have a dinner party with relatives and friends and cook and eat by yourself, do you need to apply for a food safety certificate or food business license? Of course not. There is no such provision in any law. The so-called &quot;simple processing environment, open-air operation, no &#39;three prevention&#39; facilities, and operators without valid health certificates&quot; and so on do not violate any laws. Rural gatherings, no matter whether they are weddings, weddings or other reasons, if there are many people, it is common for the host to cook in the open air in his own yard. The host is too busy, so relatives and friends help out. Do we still need relatives and friends to provide health certificates? As long as your relatives don&#39;t dislike it, the regulatory authorities have no reason to intervene. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is also possible that the person preparing the food is a chef specially hired by the host. For events with large gatherings of people, it is very common in some rural areas to hire professional chefs to serve at your doorstep. These chefs generally have a fixed team and provide mobile services in neighboring villages and charge service fees. This is indeed a commercial catering service, and it seems that the relevant personnel are required to apply for health certificates, food business licenses, etc. There are laws to follow. But the problem is that the food business licensing regulations formulated by the former State Administration of Food and Drug Administration require &quot;one license for one place&quot;, which means that to conduct food business in one place, you must obtain a license. For mobile catering services, this requirement is difficult to achieve. It is impossible to go to the regulatory authorities in advance to apply for a license every time you serve a place. Not to mention that it is difficult for these temporary venues to meet the conditions stipulated in licensing regulations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some people say that it may be managed as a food vendor. The Food Safety Law has relatively loose provisions on small food production and processing workshops and food vendors, and authorizes provincial governments to formulate specific management measures. However, in the &quot;Henan Provincial Small Food Workshops, Small Business Stores and Small Stalls Management Regulations&quot; passed by the Henan Provincial People&#39;s Congress in 2017, small food workshops and small business stores are required to have fixed production and business premises. Although small food stalls do not have fixed stores, they Stalls must also be set up at approved locations and within the specified time. Therefore, this regulation does not apply to mobile door-to-door catering services. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What should we do if there are no clear regulations to follow? Based on the abstract provision in the Food Safety Law that &quot;people engaged in food production, food sales, and catering services must obtain a license in accordance with the law,&quot; teams that provide mobile catering services are forced to apply for a license, and then they are refused and banned on the grounds that they do not meet the license conditions. , or should we follow the principle of modesty in administrative law enforcement and intervene as little as possible when there is no clear legal basis to rely on? The right choice should be self-evident. After all, rural areas are not full of restaurants like cities. Some places may be more than ten miles away from restaurants in towns, and transportation is not that convenient. It is unrealistic to travel across mountains and rivers to eat after finishing errands. Ignoring the actual needs of the rural public and using mechanical enforcement will only drive this market underground. Regulatory authorities should provide more services and less &quot;enforcement&quot;, and especially should not threaten fines at every turn. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 05 Nov 2023 21:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[深秋川西：最美季节，斑斓画卷]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259992]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-05 20:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 05 Nov 2023 20:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[首位博士说丨葛剑雄：不要指望通过玩来学历史]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260009]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-05 18:30:06&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 11/05/kEzg0k24CbQPfWdjHliBiwF8uZki3OYbTjMcSGYG.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/05/kEzg0k24CbQPfWdjHliBiwF8u Zki3OYbTjMcSGYG. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;257126&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On October 6, 2023, Ge Jianxiong was in a bookstore on Daxue Road, Shanghai&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern Weekend reporter Wei Cuicui/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Doctoral profile:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Ge Jianxiong , the first doctor of history in New China (tied with Zhou Zhenhe). &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;On December 15, 1945, he was born in Nanxun Town, Wuxing County, Zhejiang Province (now Nanxun District, Huzhou City). &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;September 1957-July 1960, studied in junior high school at Chang&#39;an Middle School in Shanghai. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;From September 1960 to July 1964, he attended high school at Shibei Middle School in Shanghai, during which he took a year and a half of sick leave. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;September 1964-July 1965, teacher training class of Shanghai Institute of Education, internship at Shibei Middle School. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;From August 1965 to September 1978, he served as a teacher and secretary of the Youth League Committee of Gutian Middle School in Shanghai. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;From October 1978 to November 1981, he was a graduate student in the History Department of Fudan University, studying under Mr. Tan Qixiang, and received his master&#39;s degree. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;In December 1981, he stayed at the school to work. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;In March 1982, he was an on-the-job doctoral candidate at the Institute of Chinese History and Geography at Fudan University, tutored by Professor Tan Qixiang. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;In June 1983, he graduated early with the approval of the Ministry of Education. In October, he was awarded a doctorate in history from Fudan University. Together with Zhou Zhenhe, he was among the first batch of liberal arts graduates in the country. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;In 1985, he was appointed associate professor; in 1991, he was appointed professor; in 1993, he was appointed doctoral supervisor. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;From 1996 to 2007, he served as the director of the Chinese Institute of Historical Geography. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;From 1999 to 2007, he concurrently served as the director of the Historical Geography Research Center, a key research base of the Ministry of Education. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;From 2007 to 2014, he served as the Director of the Library of Fudan University. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;From 2008 to 2018, he served as a member of the Standing Committee of the 11th and 12th National Committee of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;In 2014, he was appointed as a senior professor of liberal arts at Fudan University. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;In 2016, he was hired as a librarian of the Central Research Institute of Literature and History and a librarian of the Shanghai Research Institute of Literature and History. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Retired in January 2020. &lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In October 1978, green crops and soybeans were planted on the lawn of Fudan University. 32-year-old Ge Jianxiong entered the school and became a graduate student in historical geography. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;More than two months later, there were more lectures, and &quot;ballroom dancing&quot; became popular on campus. Ge Jianxiong, who was among them, also felt the vigorous vitality. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Returning to college is not easy. In December 1945, Ge Jianxiong was born in Nanxun Town, Wuxing, Zhejiang. He hoped to apply for the classical literature major at Peking University, but he was diagnosed with lung disease during a physical examination in his sophomore year of high school, and his studies were forced to interrupt. After losing the chance to take the college entrance examination twice in a row, he followed the teacher&#39;s advice and began training for teaching qualifications while preparing to take the college entrance examination. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In August 1965, Ge Jianxiong officially became an English teacher at Shanghai Gutian Middle School. He thought he would be able to enter college after his health recovered, but instead he received news that the university had suspended admissions. Ge Jianxiong has spent more than ten years teaching at Gutian Middle School. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The college entrance examination was resumed in 1977, and the age limit for taking the exam was 30 years old. The 31-year-old Ge Jianxiong was not eligible to take the exam. In 1978, graduate student enrollment was resumed and the age limit was relaxed to 40 years old, allowing Ge Jianxiong to quietly sign up. With a high school education, he was admitted to the History Department of Fudan University with the first score in the preliminary examination, and studied historical geography under Mr. Tan Qixiang. A few years later, by chance, Ge Jianxiong and his fellow student Zhou Zhenhe became the first two PhDs in history independently trained by China after the reform and opening up. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ge Jianxiong often mentioned Mr. Tan Qixiang’s ingenious metaphor about historical geography: If history is a drama, then geography is the stage, and history cannot work without this stage. Mentioning the relevance of this subject to ordinary people, Ge Jianxiong said that historical geography is omnipresent. &quot;Whether it is the changes in the natural environment or the development of human geography, such as today&#39;s folk customs and intangible cultural heritage, they are all products of the historical geographical environment.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for the reason why he entered historical geography, Ge Jianxiong explained that even if he liked history since childhood, it was just a manifestation of blind curiosity in his youth until he became a graduate student at Fudan University in October 1978 and stayed at the school to work three years later. , only then decided to take historical geography as a lifelong career. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ge Jianxiong is also a scholar with quite a personality. He often said, &quot;Don&#39;t be a nerd, don&#39;t be a hypocrite.&quot; Whether as a scholar or a member of the CPPCC, he always expressed his views outspokenly. In addition, he has traveled to Antarctica as a member of China&#39;s 17th Antarctic Expedition, climbed Mount Kilimanjaro, the &quot;King of Africa&quot;, and visited Ali, Tibet, the &quot;Roof of the World&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the last day of the National Day holiday in 2023, a Southern Weekend reporter met Ge Jianxiong in a bookstore on University Road in Shanghai. The 77-year-old man is white-haired and slightly stooped. He is wearing a dark blue cotton and linen shirt and dark gray trousers. He is carrying a white canvas bag filled with documents and books. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Missed the college entrance examination&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti; &quot;>;You once mentioned that you were unable to take the college entrance examination due to physical reasons in high school. What was the situation like at that time? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Ge Jianxiong:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;My goal in high school was to major in classical literature at Peking University, but I was diagnosed with lung disease in May of my second semester of high school. Due to widespread malnutrition, three people in our class were diagnosed with lung disease. My condition was the most serious and I had to suspend school. I originally thought that I would be able to start my senior year of high school in time after taking a three-month break, but after an examination, I found that the lesions were not completely absorbed, so I ended up taking a year and a half out of school and studying with the next class in my senior year of high school. In May 1964, I still failed the physical examination for the college entrance examination and was unable to register. Under such circumstances, I could only work as a social youth, but my teacher suggested that I join the workforce. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;What work have you done and what do you hope for the future? Planning? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Ge Jianxiong:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Shanghai Institute of Education was running a teaching qualification training course at that time, which was equivalent to a one-year college. We were sent to various key schools to receive training, and after one year we were officially assigned as teachers. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At that time, I planned to become a teacher first, and wait until I recovered before taking the college entrance examination. I trained at my alma mater, Shibei Middle School. I like literature and history, and I wanted to teach Chinese. But the teacher in charge of my class was the Chinese teacher. He said that the Chinese teacher had to correct the compositions of two classes and the burden was too heavy. He knew that I planned to enter college and suggested that I teach English so that I could have more spare time for self-study. After one year of internship, on August 5, 1965, I reported to Gutian Middle School and officially became a teacher. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;What other preparations have you made for the college entrance examination? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Ge Jianxiong: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Not long after I started working, in September 1965, the night school department of Shanghai International Studies University enrolled students, and I applied. Starting from October of that year, we had English classes two nights a week. I thought I would have the opportunity to enter university after working for two years, but when the Cultural Revolution began in 1966 and the university closed down, my hope was dashed. The university resumed enrollment in 1977, but the age requirement was 30 years old. I was over the age and had no chance. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Applying for graduate school with a high school degree, similar exceptions are available for admission Was it common at the time? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Ge Jianxiong:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;When the country resumed postgraduate enrollment, the &quot;People&#39;s Daily&quot; published an article proposing to reduce talents in any way. Many regulations have been broken. For example, a high school diploma is required to enter college, but nothing is required to enter graduate school. The age is also relaxed to 40 years old. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It was reported in the news at that time that some people graduated from elementary school and were admitted to graduate school. There was also a Shandong student who had studied with his father since he was a child and had never set foot on campus and was admitted to graduate school. The oldest among the first batch of graduate students was Qian Liqun, who was born in 1939, and the youngest recruited by Fudan was born in 1957. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You originally wanted to study classical philology, but why did you apply for Fudan University? Historical geography? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Ge Jianxiong:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I got married in March 1978 and registered for the exam in May or June. My wife wanted me to stay in Shanghai. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I really wanted to study classical philology when I was in high school, but later I found that history was more practical and safer. I didn’t know what historical geography was at first, but I liked both history and geography, so I applied for this subject. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Did the application process go smoothly? What was your mentality at the time? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Ge Jianxiong:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I prepared quietly for the first test and did not dare to tell the employer. I don&#39;t place any hope on the exam. If I can pass it, I will take it. If I fail, I won&#39;t be ashamed. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The examination room was at Shanghai Institute of Technology, which is now the Yanchang Road campus of Shanghai University, two or three kilometers away from Gutian Middle School. At eight o&#39;clock in the morning, I organized the flag-raising on the school radio and lectured the students. It took about a quarter of an hour to complete these tasks, and then I rode a bicycle for ten minutes to take the exam. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the preliminary test results came out, I ranked first. Only after I was able to take the re-examination did I start preparing seriously. I went to the public reading room of the Shanghai Library to borrow professional reference books, such as &quot;Selected Readings of Ancient Chinese Geography Classics&quot;. At that time, there was only one copy. It had been borrowed when I went there on the first day. I went to borrow it very early the next day to get it. , and it was also at this time that I met the classmates who later re-examined together. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But in fact, middle school has known it for a long time. After I enrolled in the school, the old branch secretary of the school accidentally told me that after seeing the preliminary test scores, Fudan University suspected that I had falsified my high school diploma and had sent someone to Gutian Middle School to learn about the situation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You had been working at Gutian Middle School for more than ten years when you were admitted to graduate school. Did you Are you still worried that the school won’t let you go? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Ge Jianxiong: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Yes. I was responsible for student affairs at the school and also served as the full-time Youth League Committee Secretary. I introduced the first batch of League members in the school. In 1977, I was selected as an advanced worker in education in Shanghai, and later became a deputy to the Shanghai Municipal People’s Congress. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the leaders of the Zhabei District Education Bureau specifically called the school to express their attitude - if I am admitted to graduate school, it means that the country needs me to go to graduate school more, and the school must release me unconditionally. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/05/8CTAl7WVPMKw6hkp1USDjvszLxnrwA6urOi61djs.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;614&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/05/8CTAl7WVPMKw6hkp1USDjvszLxnrwA6urOi61djs.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;257127&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In October 1983, President Xie Xide of Fudan University (left) awarded Ge Jianxiong a doctorate degree. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of interviewee)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Exceptional award of doctorate degree&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;October 1978 was the time you entered school.

After the plenary session, the big-character posters were removed, scar literature caused heated debates among students, and more and more lectures were given. Some students proposed improving the treatment of intellectuals. While the views they put forward were not necessarily mainstream, they were passionate. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Deng Xiaoping’s speech proposed that it must be ensured that scientific and technological personnel must spend at least five-sixths of their time in business work a week. Our political study time has been significantly reduced, to half a day a week. In the past, we would have meetings and study all day long, and individuals had to attend. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;What are the course arrangements after enrollment? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Ge Jianxiong: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;During the master’s period, the school offers public courses, including politics and foreign languages. I chose English, German and Japanese. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Mr. Tan offers professional courses. When he enrolled, Mr. Tan was still hospitalized. He gave us the first class in the foyer of Shanghai Longhua Hospital. After two lectures, I thought the foyer was too noisy. Mr. Tan happened to have a student working at the Shanghai Dictionary Publishing House, so he asked someone to find a house for the publishing house near Longhua Hospital. In this way, Mr. Tan gave us a semester of professional courses. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The school does not offer other professional courses and requires tutors and departments to resolve the issues themselves. Most of the courses are offered by tutors. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We have geography internships starting from this year. In 1979, two teachers took five of us graduate students to Yangzhou, Zhenjiang and Nanjing to conduct formal &quot;academic mountain climbing&quot; and observe geological structures. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You chose to stay in school after graduation and started working and studying at the same time Bo, what&#39;s the opportunity in this? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Ge Jianxiong: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;After I graduated with my master&#39;s degree, I was assigned a job. My family is in Shanghai, so I stayed in school smoothly, serving as Mr. Tan&#39;s assistant and undertaking scientific research tasks. In the spring of 1982, the country began to officially recruit doctoral students. At that time, doctoral supervisors had to go to Beijing for evaluation. It was not until 1992 that Peking University, Tsinghua, Fudan and other universities could evaluate at their own school, and they had to report to the Ministry of Education for registration. After Mr. Tan was named a doctoral supervisor in 1981, he recruited Zhou Zhenhe and me in 1982. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the whole, the number of doctoral students recruited in the first batch is very small, with only a dozen or so in the Liberal Arts Department of Fudan University. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;As the first batch of Ph.D.s, what is your training method? Is there a relatively clear training plan? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Ge Jianxiong: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;There is no standardized training method, and I don’t know what the above requirements are. After discussing with us, Mr. Tan decided to study on his own first and ask him for advice if he had any questions. Since I am his assistant and follow him all day long, I can ask for advice at any time. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Because the number of doctoral students is small, the school does not offer courses specifically for doctoral students, so we don’t know what courses are available. However, considering that there is a thesis requirement for doctoral graduation, we began to prepare the doctoral thesis shortly after the semester started in 1982. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;In September 1983, after more than a year of doctoral studies, you and Zhou Zhenhe was specially approved by the Ministry of Education to graduate early, which seems incredible today. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Ge Jianxiong:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;In May 1983, the first batch of Ph.D.s in science appeared in China. The evaluation is based on the master&#39;s thesis, and if it reaches the doctoral level, it can be recognized as a doctorate. At that time, 18 people from across the country passed, and 4 from Fudan, namely Hong Jiaxing, Zhang Yinnan, Tong Yusun and Li Shaokuan. At the meeting of the school’s academic degree committee, Mr. Tan asked whether Zhou Zhenhe’s and I’s papers could also be recognized as doctoral thesis because they were also of high quality. However, Principal Su Buqing objected. He believed that the expressions of science subjects such as mathematics and physics have international standards, while liberal arts are Chinese subjects and have no international standards. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At that time, the school already had the first batch of science Ph.D.s, but no liberal arts Ph.D.s. If you wanted to strengthen your strength, this was an entry point. Jiang Yihua, the then department chair, learned that Tsinghua University and Peking University did not yet have liberal arts PhDs, so he asked whether Fudan could strive to cultivate the first batch of liberal arts PhDs in China. They specifically approached the Vice Minister of Education Huang Xinbai, and the result was that exceptions could be made, but all courses must meet the standards. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;How do you meet the standards required by the Ministry of Education? No twists and turns? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Ge Jianxiong:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Zhou Zhenhe and I completed the closed-book politics exam. For professional courses, Mr. Tan prepared test papers based on our situation. In addition, foreign language scores are also required. Zhou Zhenhe and I both took English and Japanese during our master&#39;s degrees, and our Japanese scores were over 80 points. We proposed that the first foreign language test be English, and the second foreign language should be replaced by the Japanese scores during the master&#39;s degree. The Ministry of Education agreed. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For the thesis defense in August 1983, we invited Hou Renzhi and Shi Nianhai. However, after the defense date was set, the written approval from the Ministry of Education for our early graduation has not yet been issued. When the school learned that Huang Xinbai was having a meeting in Harbin, it sent someone to Harbin to find him to sign. The night before the defense, they made a long-distance call and said that our defense was &quot;legal&quot; only after Huang Xinbai approved it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The degree awarding ceremony will be held in September. At that time, the doctoral certificates were numbered nationwide. The first 18 numbers were for science. Zhou Zhenhe was numbered 19th and I was numbered 20th. With a clear conscience, although we graduated early as an exception, we did not take things lightly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is another episode. We were supposed to have professional titles after graduation, but due to the rectification of professional titles, it was not until 1985 that the assessment of professional titles was resumed, and Zhou Zhenhe and I were promoted to associate professors. I was named a professor in 1991 and became a doctoral supervisor in 1993. From the time I was studying for a Ph.D. to becoming a professor, I was able to continue doing academic work. If not for the reform and opening up, I would never have had these opportunities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/05/5gv0PjMm2R0vUVItxmyHEVQp06V6hOrmR2hxAVs3.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;698&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/05/5gv0PjMm2R0vUVItxmyHEVQp06V6hOrmR2hxAVs3.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;257128&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In May 1981, Ge Jianxiong (3rd from left) and his mentor Tan Qixiang (2nd from left), Zhou Youguang (1st from right) and Zhang Yunhe (1st from left). &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of interviewee)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;How come toys must make you lose your mind? &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You often mentioned Mr. Tan’s opinions on acting and The metaphor of a stage, so what is the value and significance behind studying the stage where history takes place? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Ge Jianxiong:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Historical geography is the study of geographical conditions in historical periods, including natural topography such as mountains, rivers, and humanities, Such as politics, economy and culture. The stage is an abstract metaphor, which actually refers to all geographical conditions, geographical elements and geographical distribution in the past. The value behind it lies in how we apply it.

But for a subject to become a knowledge, at least there must be people studying the basic fields. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When the Fudan University Library held its centenary exhibition, it asked me for a topic, and it was finally decided to be &quot;The Legend of the End of the Fire&quot;. I took out a few exhibits. The first one is Mr. Tan&#39;s university graduation thesis - &quot;History of Chinese Immigration&quot;. His instructor was Mr. Pan Guangdan. This manuscript also contains Pan Guangdan&#39;s comments. The second item is a six-volume history of Chinese immigration that I edited. The third thing is the books published by my students on the history of Chinese population and Chinese immigration. There are about six kinds of books. There are also many doctoral theses written by their students. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Our four generations have focused on the topic of Chinese immigration history, from unpublished university thesis manuscripts, to compiled six volumes, to so many papers, and we have truly passed it down. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Combined with your own experience and feelings, the development of historical geography and What is the connection between reform and opening up? &amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Ge Jianxiong:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;In general, historical geography used to be a very small subject. Later, thanks to Mr. Tan&#39;s &quot;Atlas of Chinese History&quot; and everyone&#39;s continuous efforts after the reform and opening up, the social visibility of the subject was improved. If he could not seek truth from facts when studying historical geography, Mr. Tan would be very painful. However, the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee restored the line of seeking truth from facts. On such a major issue as historical maps, Mr. Tan received support from the central government. Mr. Tan was very moved. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;After so many years of research, what is your understanding of historical geography? What deeper understanding has there been of the subject? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Ge Jianxiong:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;After entering this discipline, I feel that the development of the discipline is inseparable from the line of seeking truth from facts. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, Marx’s historical materialism fully affirms the role of material foundation in history, and historical geography studies the stage and material foundation of history. If Marxist materialism can be used as technical guidance, historical and geographical research can naturally serve reality. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some major issues can be explained from the perspective of historical geography, while exploring the positive and negative roles played by geographical conditions in the process of historical development. For example, Mr. Tan proposed in 1962 that the fundamental reason for the long-term steady flow of the Yellow River after the Eastern Han Dynasty was the change in land use patterns in the middle reaches, which greatly reduced soil erosion. The good degree of vegetation maintenance in the middle reaches of the Yellow River determines the severity of soil erosion. Therefore, farming or animal husbandry in the middle reaches directly affects the safety of the lower reaches of the Yellow River. He proposed that the middle reaches of the Yellow River cannot be all engaged in agriculture, and should be adapted to local conditions. Farming should be done if it is suitable for agriculture, pastoral should be used for grazing, and forest should be used for forestry. It needs to be comprehensively developed and utilized comprehensively. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although this view has been criticized, its advanced accuracy has been fully proven after the reform and opening up. This is now the case in the middle reaches of the Yellow River, with some returning farmland to forests and some returning farmland to grassland. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;After becoming a doctoral supervisor in 1993, based on your past life experiences, you What are the differences in admissions? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Ge Jianxiong:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I am an eclectic person, and several students were recruited with the approval of the school. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Like my student Ma Menglong, he failed the doctoral entrance examination, but after talking with him, I found that he has great potential, has strong logical thinking, and is very good at using his brain. I encouraged him to go back and review before taking the exam. Later, I felt that it was not enough to let him review by himself, so I decided to recruit him specially. The school stipulates that academicians and tutors who have produced hundreds of outstanding doctoral theses across the country can be specially recruited. I took advantage of this right and came up with the questions myself. After he answered the questions, I graded the results and handed the papers to the school. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the first year of recruitment, Ma Menglong couldn’t understand the class and was very anxious. I advised him not to worry, I believe you can follow me. Later, he slowly came to his senses, and his graduation thesis was of a very high standard, and even won the top 100 in the country. If I were not given autonomy, this kind of student would never be able to get in. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, Fudan has this tradition, which stipulates that academicians and doctoral supervisors who have produced top 100 papers have the right to recruit special talents. Then we should make full use of this right to discover special talents. As Mr. Tan advocates, on the one hand, we must abide by the system, but on the other hand, we must leave room for special circumstances. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;In addition to academic research, Notice You is also a mobile game Academic consultants participate in the construction of the historical values ​​​​of the game.

In ancient times, it was said that playing with things makes you lose your morale. How come playing with things must make you lose your morale? Can you keep your ambition without playing? Modern society is all about production, material rather than spiritual, but people have the right to play, and citizens&#39; right to play should be protected. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But don’t expect to learn history by playing, that’s ridiculous. A nation that does not pay attention to history is pathetic, and a nation that can only learn history through games is even more pathetic. History is very serious and must be studied seriously. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I serve as an academic advisor for mobile games, just to make sure that the values ​​of the game are okay. As long as the game is harmless, it is fine, but the values ​​​​must be correct. I once suggested to them to avoid causing harm to young people, and later strengthened supervision through secondary certification. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 05 Nov 2023 18:55:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[“小姐姐报警称被同行人抛弃”：做旅游搭子应摒弃巨婴心态丨快评]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260007]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-05 18:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Recently, an incident in which &quot;a young lady called the police and claimed that she was abandoned by a travel partner&quot; has attracted public attention. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 27, a woman posted a video on social media, saying in tears that &quot;she was abandoned by her travel partner&quot; and that she had already called the police. According to her description, there were five people in this &quot;travel group&quot;, including a couple and two men besides her. The group started traveling by car from Chengdu, and Daocheng Yading was the last stop. We originally agreed to drive back to Chengdu in the evening after climbing the mountain on the 27th. The woman involved said that when she came back at seven o&#39;clock that night, she found that the other four people had abandoned her and gone back first, and had stored her luggage in the hotel. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 29, events took a turn. Another woman who was traveling with her posted a clarification, pointing out several facts. First, the pick-up group had repeatedly emphasized to the woman in advance that they would meet at the foot of the mountain at 16:30 that day and then drive back to Chengdu, but the woman ultimately ignored this; second, everyone urged her many times to no avail and could not contact her. at 18:30, she finally gave up and left, but stored her luggage at the hotel and shared her experience on the return route; third, after the woman involved called the police, the police also confirmed that they were not responsible for the matter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Looking at the entire incident, it can be seen that the woman involved completely ignored the agreement between the &quot;travel partners&quot; and acted arbitrarily in the AA-style escort group, and always asked others to &quot;help her&quot; in the process. &quot;Leave her alone&quot;, claiming that it is not your prerogative. The most critical thing is that she failed to fulfill the punctual obligation of &quot;meeting at 16:30&quot; that the group had repeatedly confirmed, and she couldn&#39;t be contacted in the middle of the trip, so the other partners had no choice but to leave early. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To be fair, after all, travel groups are very different from travel agency group tours. It is completely possible to &quot;discuss everything&quot; on specific matters, as long as it wins the consent of the majority of people or does not hinder other members rights and interests. Taking this incident as an example, the woman involved could have disagreed with the meeting time in advance and tried to persuade others to postpone the meeting. Of course, the woman involved could also offer to give others a certain amount of financial compensation and wait until she came back before setting off; that was really not possible. , you can also declare to &quot;leave the group&quot; without interfering with each other, eliminating the need for subsequent disputes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, problems similar to &quot;tourists not arriving at the meeting point at the specified time&quot; will also occur in group tours of travel agencies, which has also caused many disputes. Whenever a similar situation occurs, there are always two directions. The first is that &quot;a group of people are waiting for one person&quot; but they dare not speak out and allow tourists who do not abide by the contract to damage the rights and interests of others; the second is that the travel agency &quot;does not tolerate him&quot; after seeking the consent of the tourists present and gathers them to leave first. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In March 2023, during a dispute over the &quot;One-day trip to Beijing Olympic Park&quot; involving a tour group from Tianjin, the tour guide asked to gather at 15:00, but tourist Song and four other people did not arrive until 15:30 because of their children. At the meeting point, the tour guide car has left at this time, and tourists have to return to Tianjin on their own. Song and others requested the travel agency to refund a total of 8,490 yuan including all travel expenses, liquidated damages, self-return expenses, and mental damages. After the trial, the court held that Song and others had breached the contract and the travel agency had no liability for compensation, and dismissed the plaintiff&#39;s lawsuit. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If travel agencies have obligations to abide by contracts and need to bear liability for breach of contract, then the same is true for tourists. Put it in the scenario of &quot;travel hook-ups&quot;, that is, every hook-up has an obligation to keep the contract, and they also need to bear the same liability for breach of contract. Of course, partners can also reach different proportions of rights and obligations distribution plans, and women can also receive some care, such as &quot;help her and let her&quot; in this incident, but this does not mean that the woman involved can Regardless of breach of contract, unless she really treats other partners as personal tour guides. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Details of this case show that the five-person group that set off this time did not reach any form of written contract, so there is no way to talk about their respective rights and obligations stipulated in black and white. The travel agreement between the group members was reached in the form of a verbal contract, and the only written form was nothing more than &quot;WeChat group chat records.&quot; After the woman in question withdrew from the group, the chat records became incomplete, which once affected the determination of facts and gave the woman in question room to gain a head start and &quot;preemptively draw pictures&quot; on social media. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, although &quot;travel partners&quot; are much more flexible than travel agency group tours, they still have to abide by the contract reached between each other so that the entire team can successfully complete the journey. &quot;Travel partner&quot; can be regarded as a tiny autonomous group. The success of the journey depends on the contractual spirit, organizational ability, communication and coordination ability of each team member. To put it bluntly, it is how to adjust the relationship between &quot;individual&quot; and &quot;team&quot; The relationship of rights and obligations between each other, so that each partner has &quot;equal rights and responsibilities&quot; in the itinerary, only in this way can the situation of everyone be improved. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Compared with the standard contracts and team formats of travel agencies and group tours, the travel format of &quot;travel partners&quot; is full of more flexibility and uncertainty, which also tests the comprehensive skills of team members. Qualities include but are not limited to physical fitness, interpersonal skills, self-rescue ability, adaptability, etc. This case also shows that in addition to safety issues, contract issues have arisen in the emerging business of travel hookups. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Freedom is not free, it also means responsibility. Even if it is a &quot;go as you please&quot; and &quot;flexible&quot; travel group, this kind of freedom does not mean that you can do whatever you want, and it cannot evolve into the behavior of letting others foot the bill at any time. Since the tour group has delegated the freedom of travel to each partner, it also requires each partner to fulfill their own responsibilities, abide by the contracts reached with other partners, and be responsible for their own choices at any time and bear the costs. , you can enjoy the joy of traveling with strangers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 05 Nov 2023 18:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[成都地铁被疑偷拍案开庭，涉事女子“差一个道歉”]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260000]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-05 17:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;He Jun described the incident on Weibo, with diagrams of each scene .

For the first time, He Jun wrote a long article on Weibo based on his own memories, and always kept this article at the top of Weibo. After the case entered the investigation and evidence collection stage, He Jun made additional corrections to some details based on the contents of surveillance videos and law enforcement recorders, and gradually updated them on Weibo. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On June 11, 2023, He &lt;span>;Jun&lt;/span>; took the subway home from Xipu, Chengdu. When he arrived at the South Railway Station, there was Two girls said they saw the green light flashing on his shoes and suspected that he was filming secretly. According to the video provided by passengers in the same carriage, two girls pointed at his shoes and said, &quot;It&#39;s shining, it&#39;s not reflecting light, it&#39;s shining.&quot; &quot;When we were filming, he put it on closed&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;After the train safety officer of the car arrived, He Jun took off his shoes in public according to the girl&#39;s request. After the train safety officer and the two girls checked, no camera was found. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;He Jun recalled to Southern Weekend reporters before the court session that during this process, everyone on the train suddenly focused their attention on him, and some people deliberately looked out. When he looked up, he saw someone was taking pictures with a mobile phone, which already made him feel uncomfortable. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Another place that made him feel uncomfortable was when he arrived at the station. The security officer and the station attendant arranged for him to stand against the wall and take off his right shoe. He Jun said that the environment he was in at that time was a public place connected to the platform. Passengers coming and going could see him taking off his right shoe and socks and standing next to the wall. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;I think this matter is not final. I was just a suspect at the time, so we should consider reducing some of the impact, such as taking me to a In a place with few people, maybe use something to block me, that’s what I thought.” He Jun believed that this was something Chengdu Metro did improperly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Liu Dan, He Jun&#39;s attorney, told Southern Weekend reporters that they added Chengdu Metro as a defendant precisely because Chengdu Metro had problems with expanding the damage. It is true that the subway security officer did not force He Jun to take off his shoes or search him, but after a preliminary check that he was not secretly photographed, he could consider finding an office where the two parties could sit down and negotiate and wait for the police to arrive. Liu Dan said that in the case, He Jun also took the initiative to call the police. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;After the police took off He Jun&#39;s shoes for inspection, they confirmed that there was no camera. The police also showed a restored video taken at the same location on the subway, and speculated that the advertising plates on both sides were reflected on the shiny surface of the shoes, reflecting green light. After mediation by the police, the two &lt;span>;&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;girls&lt;/span>; apologized to He Jun. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;He Jun is not satisfied with this apology. He said that according to the video content of the law enforcement recorder reviewed afterwards, the older female student said &quot;I&#39;m sorry, handsome man&quot;, and the younger female student said immediately &quot;We I have wronged you.&quot; &quot;The entire sentence did not take more than two seconds,&quot; He Jun said. They were &lt;span>;wearing&lt;/span>; masks and could not hear clearly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In the long article recorded by He Jun afterwards, the police mediation was still continuing, and the girl &lt;span>;&lt;/span>; emphasized that she was speaking for the public. , to prevent other people&#39;s privacy from being infringed, and He Jun emphasized that the two &lt;span>;girls&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;girls&lt;/span>; had a &quot;meal-eating&quot; mentality to share their experiences with their friends. &lt;p>; &quot;After they apologized, I think they may have made up their minds (to defend their rights),&quot; He Jun said. The next day, he took the initiative to post the experience online with the subject &quot;I was falsely accused of being secretly filmed by wearing a shoe-covered camera on the Chengdu subway.&quot; &quot;, hoping to record the progress of his rights protection, and also hope to find &lt;span>;eyewitnesses&lt;/span>; in the same carriage through the Internet.

At first, He Jun could not find any evidence such as video of the scene to prove the place of occurrence, which made it impossible to file a case in court for investigation and evidence collection. After many twists and turns, a man in the same carriage provided a signed certificate stating that the incident had occurred on Chengdu Metro Line 1, and the case was officially filed on August 15. During subsequent evidence collection, Chengdu Metro informed the platform that the monitoring equipment was damaged and the video was missing. On September 27, after communicating with his lawyer, He Jun added Chengdu Metro as a defendant in the prosecution case. The main reason was that Chengdu Metro was suspected of breach of contract and infringement. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Although some netizens demanded &quot;severe punishment&quot;, He Jun has not disclosed the two &lt;span>;names&lt;/span online in the six months since he posted this experience >;&lt;span>;Girls&lt;/span>; appearance, name and other private information.

She believes that the two women involved suspected that someone was filming secretly and found the subway security officer to intervene in the verification. There was no problem in itself. In some situations where sexual harassment is alleged, finding a third party to intervene can help resolve the dispute. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The key is that after the facts were clarified, this man spent time and energy to cooperate with the investigation and was scrutinized in public. &quot;He felt bad.&quot; Therefore, it is necessary and reasonable to demand an apology and explanation. &quot;The core problem for the girls in this case is that the process of &lt;span>; and &lt;/span>; apologizing was not explained in the end.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On the other hand, Ding Yaqing believes that Chengdu The train safety officers of the subway do not have the power to enforce the law, and their actions may not be appropriate in this regard. &quot;I noticed that the person involved said that the security officer carried him away,&quot; Ding Yaqing said. This &lt;span>;suggested&lt;/span>; whether the security officer exceeded his authority to conduct a search. She suggested that in places such as subways where sexual harassment accusations are prone to occur, staff should be trained, such as how to respond when such accusations occur, what are the staff&#39;s scope of authority, how to appease both parties, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;She believes that the response to sexual harassment accusations in public places can be compared to passengers encountering theft on the subway or bus - find a third party, The police, who have law enforcement powers, do not need to raise the issue of differences between men and women and gender antagonism. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Ding Yaqing analyzed that in general personality rights infringement cases, the responsibilities stipulated by law include stopping the infringement, eliminating the impact, making an apology, etc. He Jun&#39;s current demands One is to publicly apologize, but whether the scope of disclosure refers to the place where the incident occurred or on social media such as Weibo, and to whom the incident will be made public, etc., will also depend on the circumstances of the court trial. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Liu Dan said that since the case is not open for trial, the form of a public apology cannot be revealed. &quot;But it must be public, because the infringement is also public, and the apology It should also be made public.” After the court hearing that day, Liu Dan said in an interview that there was a fierce debate in the court and the other party also provided tenable arguments.

Ji Shuteng also gradually sees another side of his nature.

After the troubled times, God gave him the most suitable arrangement for him who was both civil and military. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The rest of his life seems to prove that he has been on a smooth road since then. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Zhou Tao who left Kashgar, like Ji Shuteng in &quot;Journey to the West&quot;, had no nostalgia for the yellow land where he had lived for a long time. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;&quot;Why are you so unsympathetic? The answer is: This is not my place in the first place.&quot; He believes that wherever a person grows up before the age of 18, that place will become His eternal home. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Before the age of 9, Zhou Tao lived in Beijing. Before receiving re-education in Yili and being transferred to Kashgar, he lived with his parents in Urumqi - clearly &quot;higher&quot; than southern Xinjiang in his eyes. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The sense of superiority is innate. The first is appearance. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;He has been born with white skin and big eyes since he was a child. Among the dolls with foreign children, he is also the most eye-catching one. The whole Zhou family has fair skin. He once asked his aunt, what is grandpa like? My aunt said, &quot;Your grandfather can&#39;t be compared to any of you. He&#39;s so handsome.&quot; Zhou Tao felt that his family&#39;s bloodline should be mixed, because his hometown in Yushe, Shanxi, is a mixed race area, &quot;where the Xiongnu, Qiang, and Jiedi gather.&quot;&lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Xiao Qiao, a military writer who is nearly 10 years younger than him, said that Zhou Tao was born with a &quot;face and figure that make people doubt God&#39;s favoritism. Coupled with his humor, cunning, quick reactions and sharp words, This kind of person can easily make people jealous and at the same time create a desire for friendship.&quot; &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Beyond the skin, family background is the foundation. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Zhou Tao’s father, Zhou Wenjie, participated in the Shanxi Anti-Japanese Youth Death Team in his early years&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;（&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot; >;The non-party groups at that time were actually anti-Japanese groups led by the Communist Party. They later became regular troops&lt;/span>;)&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;, engaged in mass work, served as cultural teachers, and later became Chen Geng&#39;s subordinates. During the founding ceremony of the People&#39;s Republic of China, Zhou Wenjie, a battalion-level cadre, stood in the first row below the Tiananmen Gate. Later, he was admitted to the army as a diplomat and was assigned to the School of Foreign Languages. Before the &quot;Cultural Revolution&quot;, he was a cadre at the fourteenth level. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Zhou Tao’s primary school classmates include many children of senior cadres. A sense of superiority was invisibly injected into Zhou Tao&#39;s mind during his childhood. He remembered that when his younger brother was born, the hospital made egg fried rice for his mother at noon. She refused to eat it and gave it to 4-year-old Zhou Tao. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;At the age of 4, Zhou Tao was standing on a hillside in Haidian District, just in time for work in the morning. He felt like a general. &quot;Looking at the gray, blue and black crowds of people under my feet, I suddenly felt a sense of superiority in my heart.&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Zhou Tao will remember this idea throughout his life. Strange: &quot;How could such an idea come to mind at such a young age?&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;That idea was the bud from the foundation of his thoughts throughout his life. The buds grow and are associated with him throughout his life. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;His classmate Zhao Nan once saw a beggar on the street and said, what if we end up in this situation one day? Zhou Tao replied: &quot;Even if we are reduced to this point, others will look different when we stand.&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;&quot;Many revolutionary children have that sense of superiority. In fact, compared to this Judging from decades of history, it is very superficial. The concept of &#39;the world&#39; is also very decadent.&quot; Yin Shi said. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Zhou Tao was not aware of it. He wrote about the pride and stubbornness of Ji Shuteng&#39;s class in &quot;Journey to the West&quot;:&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;blockquote>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 凯体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>; There is a little guy who is only in the third grade of elementary school and can memorize the names, positions, and military ranks of dozens of marshals, ten generals, and more than sixty generals. The man was surprised and asked: &quot;Then what kind of general can you be when you grow up?&quot; The answer was: &quot;At least a general.&quot; When he grew up to sixteen or seventeen years old, he became more and more handsome, talented in sports and arts, just like the revolutionary career of his father&#39;s generation. There really is some kind of blood inheritance. But after entering society, most of them cannot adapt. ...As for the spiritual legacy of the Chinese revolution: the pursuit of social equality and the new culture of advocating altruism, they have completely disappeared. There is no doubt that Ji Shuteng himself is one of these people. He knows very well that he was &quot;fed by strictly selected food.&quot; He is also convinced: &quot;This is exactly how our generation is full of ambitions.&quot; Faith grows like a stone, water cannot be poured into it, needles cannot penetrate it, and it is difficult for anything else to penetrate into our minds.”&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;/blockquote>; &lt;p>; &lt;span>;Among such a group of stubborn leaders with high vision, Zhou Tao&#39;s unruly attitude is even more prominent. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;As evidenced by his father’s memories: “When Tao was fourteen or fifteen years old, he loved horseback riding and bicycle riding. Once, he went to Nanshan with a party school cadre and rode a Kazakh horse alone. The horse galloped on the mountain road, and the witnesses were horrified. The leader yelled and cursed before stopping.&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;He has good physical fitness and once won the Xinjiang college men&#39;s table tennis singles championship. . But when I was in junior high school, I went to Beijing for a year of training, and I didn’t want to do it anymore. I deliberately trampled the ball and threw the racket on the wall. &quot;I felt particularly awkward after the head coach asked me to change the crossboard, because my personality is offensive rather than defensive. If I was asked to play defense, I wouldn&#39;t want to. If I didn&#39;t want to, I would destroy it and quit.&quot;&lt;/ span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Although he is unrestrained and youthful, he also has a way of assessing the situation that is different from his peers. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;At the age of fourteen or fifteen, he already understood that playing table tennis would not accomplish anything. It&#39;s not about physical condition or mind, it&#39;s about starting too late. &quot;If I were to be in Beijing, I would definitely join the national team. The conditions are sufficient.&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;There is another thing that he doesn&#39;t mind. Wu Guomei, a middle school Chinese teacher, gave Zhou Tao a score of 95 for his composition and gave him great encouragement. Other students regarded note-taking as a chore, but he was the only one who found joy in taking notes. &quot;Why did I win as soon as I wrote prose? Because I had written it a long time ago, and the ten notebooks are prose.&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Literature is talent, and it is also Zhou Tao&#39;s upward path. The clearest one. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/05/73a2271d659b7a2e6a6d7fc959a3ccde.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;869&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/05/73a2271d659b7a2e6a6d7fc959a3ccde.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;257103&quot; data-mce-width=&quot; 0&quot; data-mce-height=&quot;0&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span>;In 1965, Zhou Tao won the Xinjiang college student table tennis singles championship&lt; /span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4 data-css=&quot;box-sizing: border-box;color: inherit;margin: 0px;padding: 5px 15px 0px&quot;>;&lt;span data-css=&quot;box-sizing:border- box;color:inherit;font-size:18px;margin:0px;padding:0px&quot;>;&lt;strong>;An Inhuman Year&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;《Twenty &quot;Four Ploughshares&quot; was often requested by Zhou Tao to be placed at the top of his collection of essays, which shows that he attached great importance to this article. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;That came from the year he received re-education at Yili 9901 Farm. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;When we went there, everyone sat in a big sedan and sang along the way, such as &quot;Prairie Pastoral&quot; and &quot;Red Plum Blossoms on the Red Rocks&quot;.

My ear was bitten off.&quot; The arrogant and ruthless instructor refused to allow the sick students to see a doctor.

Sexual judgment is tantamount to denying one&#39;s own guilt. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Zhou Tao did not respond at all. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;&quot;Have you shown the description in the autobiography to Teacher Marvin?&quot; I asked him. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;&quot;No.&quot; Zhou Tao smiled. There was an understanding in the smile that &quot;even if she saw it, she would just laugh it off&quot;, but also a trace of fear. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4 data-css=&quot;box-sizing: border-box;color: inherit;margin: 0px;padding: 5px 15px 0px&quot;>;&lt;span data-css=&quot;box-sizing:border -box;color:inherit;font-size:18px;margin:0px;padding:0px&quot;>;&lt;strong>;No more poetry after the age of 40&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;span >;In the late 1970s, fortune befell Zhou Tao, who had an unappreciated talent. Relying on his literary talent and his relationship with his father, he successfully transferred to the Military Region Creative Office in Urumqi and concentrated on making a living through literature. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;When writers Cao Yu and Xu Chi went to Xinjiang in August 1978, after reading Zhou Tao&#39;s poem &quot;North and South of Tianshan&quot;, they praised at a symposium that &quot;it is sentimental and interesting. real poetry&quot;. Zhou Tao was caught off guard by this great news and thought of Liu Shaotang, the former &quot;prodigy writer&quot; who sparked his literary dream. &quot;The teacher in high school was telling his story &quot;The Green Mule&quot; on the podium. He&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;(Liu Shaotang)&lt; /span>;&lt;span>;Sitting in class with classmates and listening to lectures. What a feeling that must be!&quot; When I was 30 years old, I met an expert who appreciated me, and I felt happy in my heart. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The next two or three years became the explosive period of Zhou Tao&#39;s poetry. Xiao Qiao remembers that almost every two days in 1981, a new poem by Zhou Tao would gush out of magma from the ground. &quot;Look at their dates, they are as dense as the footprints left by poets when they go out every day!&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Zhou Tao once collaborated with Yang Mu and Zhang Deyi to create &quot;New Frontier Poetry&quot;, It is not about war, but about reflecting the unique features of the Xinjiang region. For a time, their names occupied the pages of &quot;Poetry Magazine&quot;, &quot;People&#39;s Literature&quot;, and &quot;Shanghai Literature&quot; one after another, and they were at the forefront of the literary trend. Liu Xiaowu, chairman of the Xinjiang Federation of Literary and Art Circles, objected to this on the grounds that &quot;frontier poems were originally about conquering the northwest, but now Xinjiang is part of the motherland, who are you going to conquer?&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Wait After starting to write hazy poetry, Zhou Tao once gave himself a direction - &quot;Guo Xiaochuan&#39;s voice, Wen Jie&#39;s color&quot;, but found that this combination &quot;doesn&#39;t work very well&quot;. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/05/0e32231c9649e4b49505957342ee2a0b.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 984&quot; height=&quot;579&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/05/0e32231c9649e4b49505957342ee2a0b.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;257108&quot; data-mce-width=&quot; 0&quot; data-mce-height=&quot;0&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span>;In 1984, three military writers were at Kunming Airport, preparing to take a flight The helicopter flew to Laoshan.

At first, he even told writers who had not gone up the mountain about the dangers of going up the mountain to scare them; later, he witnessed with his own eyes soldiers who were blinded by Vietnamese army mines. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;After getting used to it, the soldiers can sleep well at night. &quot;The helmets were lying beside the pillows, and their faces were sleeping like sculptures. They were all people who escaped from the hands of death.&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Tiantian and Soldiers They ate and slept together and became familiar with each other. Zhou Tao did not hear any heroic words from their mouths. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;How does it feel to fight? The soldier said, &quot;It&#39;s so scary when the enemy&#39;s shells are covering it. I wish I could crawl under the ground and climb up quickly, regardless of my posture. There&#39;s no way to express the terror. It&#39;s absolutely irresistible to human will. If you can escape, That&#39;s pretty good.&quot; Zhou Tao imagined that it would be the same when our artillery fire covered the other side. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;He wrote a long poem of 2,000 lines, &quot;Mountains, Mountains, Jungles.&quot; The poem not only contains the cruelty of war, but also a writing perspective that transcends victory, defeat and cause and effect: &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;blockquote>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot; >;My poor and stubborn neighbor&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: italic, italic_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;My distant relative who has a melancholic temperament and is prone to disputes&lt;/ span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 凯体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;When I fight you&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot; font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;My heart is actually angry and painful&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti ;&quot;>;Almost crying while beating&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 凯体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;I beat another part of myself with tears &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Dongfang——is the name of our common grandmother&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot; >;Generation after generation of dead did not make the earth rot&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 凯体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;but it was the living people who made it crowded and chaotic &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;All forms of death&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot; font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;The purpose is to remind and explore the meaning of life&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti ;&quot;>;The dead are no longer afraid of death&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 凯体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;The living are fearful&lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;——&quot;Mountains, Mountains, Jungles, Jungles&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;/blockquote>; &lt;p>; &lt;span>;This long poem has only been published in two not-so-famous frontier publications, and the single version has not been published due to the publishing company splitting the edition, so it has not entered the eyes of more readers. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;&quot;It&#39;s a bit of a pity. It has been ignored for no reason. If this poem can be published in full in a publication like &quot;People&#39;s Literature&quot;, the impact will be great.&quot; Yin Shi et al. Many critics and friends expressed injustice for Zhou Tao. The author himself thought about it, &quot;It was too easy to write, very casual. I just started writing it in the notebook for fun, and then it became longer and longer without changing a word. No one else believed it.&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Zhou Tao said that his only enemy is himself. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Writing poems was very exciting, but his requirement for himself was: my poems should reach the national level&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;(top)&lt;/span>;&lt;span >;Level, I won’t write it down. Sure enough, when he won the National Award on his 40th birthday, he felt that his poetry career had come to an end. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The next hill to attack? Prose. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Zhou Tao believes that his contribution and originality lies in &quot;liberation prose&quot;: &quot;What is important in prose writing is not testing and dismemberment, but feeling and embracing&quot;. He does not like &quot;research&quot; &quot;, preferring to indulge in endless daydreams, leisurely reflections, and tastes, so he doesn&#39;t care about the abruptness of the beginning, the transition and correspondence between the upper and lower paragraphs, and writes prose based on the logic, structure, and writing style of poetry. He even said arrogantly, &quot;Prose has no rules. I am the rules.&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;So in Zhou Tao&#39;s words, various memories, thoughts, emotions and imaginations rush together and cross paths. The river water on the embankment spreads in all directions on the endless grassland. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;He is disgusted with the idea of ​​&quot;traveling in mountains and rivers&quot;, thinking that it is just &quot;treating mountains and waters as spiritual prostitutes.&quot; In the famous work &quot;Gonnas&#39;s Horse&quot;, he regards the appreciation of the horse&#39;s spirit and muscles as an artistic enjoyment; in &quot;Bird of Prey&quot;, he focuses on a horse that fought with an old wolf, its claws were dug into the bones of the old wolf and the trunk of the tree, and finally ran away. An eagle torn apart by wolves; in &quot;Crossing the River&quot;, I marvel that a thin old Kazakh woman over eighty years old subdued a fierce horse that refused to cross the river...&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span >;Whether it is a sacred mountain, a wild horse, or a human being, in Zhou Tao&#39;s passionate and bold expressions, there will always be a strong &quot;master&#39;s self-statement&quot; color, thinking that he is strong and sympathetic to the strong. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/05/869c4630e5db9b2e0e06a7b6a78217b2.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 498&quot; height=&quot;828&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/05/869c4630e5db9b2e0e06a7b6a78217b2.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;257110&quot; data-mce-width=&quot; 0&quot; data-mce-height=&quot;0&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;His prose is characterized by its length&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;(&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312 , STKaiti;&quot;>;Several articles are more than 20,000 words&lt;/span>;)&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;, famous for his strong expression and impulse to think. Zhou Tao once had a calm understanding of this: &quot;Speculation is a component in prose. If it is excessive, it will harm art. Therefore, I particularly value Jia Pingwa&#39;s prose. He does not focus on speculation but captures the hidden meaning of life. He pays more attention to the direct sensitivity to the original form of life. My recognition of him actually shows my recognition of some of my own shortcomings.&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Although it was over 20 years ago, Although he had the above understanding, his habit of eagerly expressing his thoughts has not changed since then. It can still be seen in &quot;Journey to the West&quot;. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Zhou Tao has the complacency of a proud man and the fear of &quot;losing what he has gained&quot; hanging over his head. He is obsessed with literature, thinking that it is free, fair and unfair. As complex as politics is. 20 years ago, he won the Lu Xun Literature Award for the first time for his collection of essays, but he did not go to accept the award. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The reason? &quot;The various literary awards are far from what I imagined. The awards must be fair. They must not be mixed up, and they must not be sprinkled with pepper. They must be awarded to those who are most worthy of the award. No matter who that person is, it may not be me.&quot; &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;He said that in the 1980s, the national goal was clear and everyone was full of hope. The entire era was the emotion exaggerated by &quot;The Toast Song&quot;. But in the early 1990s, he inevitably developed a feeling of nihilism, drifted away from society, and was no longer so direct. &quot;The Panic of Winter in Bortala&quot; was written in such a state - but only a few people understand it. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/05/569f47056b7b988679b14a3928354a6f.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 984&quot; height=&quot;712&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/05/569f47056b7b988679b14a3928354a6f.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;257109&quot; data-mce-width=&quot; 0&quot; data-mce-height=&quot;0&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span>;In March 1986, Zhou Tao (first from right) won the first place in the country The second New Poetry (Collection of Poetry) Award, the first from the left is the famous poet Ai Qing, and the award recipient is Hu Qiaomu&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4 data-css=&quot;box-sizing: border-box;color: inherit;margin: 0px ;padding: 5px 15px 0px&quot;>;&lt;span data-css=&quot;box-sizing:border-box;color:inherit;font-size:18px;margin:0px;padding:0px&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Destined? &lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In &quot;Journey to the West&quot;, which was completed more than 20 years later, Zhou Tao wrote that Ji Shuteng and other cadres went to the countryside and enjoyed a meal of grilled fish under the Populus euphratica forest by the Yarkant River. Feast: &quot;The ancient Maigaiti people used magic to catch big and lively fish from the river! ... The tray was presented, and the taste was really fragrant!&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt; p>;&lt;span>;What is worth noting is not the delicious food, but the attitude of the food provider and the user: &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;blockquote>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 毷体, 凯体_ GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;The leaders of the inspection team sat cross-legged in the open space among the Populus euphratica trees, and the floor was covered with gorgeous Hotan carpets. The villagers held the trays, bowed their heads, and crouched like they were serving an emperor. Who taught them these great rituals? When did this tearful civilization develop? Ji Shuteng suddenly felt guilty, feeling that he was not worthy of such a feast and pious etiquette, and felt sorry for these desert people who danced the sword dance beside the campfire and painted peasant paintings in the orchard. What have we done for others to deserve such grand reception? ” &amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;——&quot;Journey to the West&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;/blockquote >; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;This reminds me of Zhou Tao&#39;s long essay &quot;Essays on Halashal&quot; written in the 1980s. In that article, he associated the chapped lips of his fellow travelers with Ma Zhongying&#39;s Hui people more than half a century ago. The soldiers fought bloody battles with the Uyghurs of Hoja Niyazi, but now, the relics of the past are left by the thirsty lips of the north.&lt;/span>; &quot;>;Waterless ravines&lt;/span>;)&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;ate up all.&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;He saw in the Hui people living in Yanqi A kind of &quot;hundred years of loneliness&quot; that not everyone can feel: &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;blockquote>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Forbearance and silence Behind the eyes of suspicion and sly distrust is the most sincere promise and life-saving friendship; the pain caused by the contradiction between the humiliating inferiority complex and the strong self-esteem deep in the heart; not being understood But they stubbornly want to preserve the barriers they have formed; the sadness and stubbornness caused by the great contrast between the backward lifestyle of remoteness and poverty and the self-confidence of the sky are the result of this kind of hundred years of loneliness.&lt;/ span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;/blockquote>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;He pointed out, &quot;The history of the Chinese nation is not just the history of the Han people. There are countless emperors, famous ministers, and military generals who have served the country in the past generations who are from ethnic minorities. . &quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Such ink and views are rare in his decades of rich writing.&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt; span>;Yin Shi, who has been friends with him for many years, sharply pointed out his problem: &quot;He still doesn&#39;t express enough about the land of Xinjiang and the Uyghurs and other ethnic minorities. Zhou Tao also expressed the shrewdness of a Han man on this point. He did not learn from the language, classics, secular culture, or any other aspect - he did not go deep into Xinjiang. &quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In the analysis of &quot;Journey to the West&quot; just written, Yin Shi said bluntly: &quot;If each of them&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;(protagonist)&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;&#39;s inner world can also be unfolded like Ji Shuteng&#39;s, especially if the personal spiritual world, cultural character and even national attributes of the Uyghur character Simayi Ahematijiang are deeply explored and presented. Then the many voices in this work, including the dialogue between different &#39;voices&#39;, will create great tension. &quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Why can&#39;t it be expanded?&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;&quot;The language barrier is one, and the fear of being real is the other. It can only go so far. &quot;Zhou Tao answered me.&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;He has expressed his admiration for Zhang Chengzhi, but he also admitted that the latter has reached the extreme in his faith. In fact, Zhou Tao&#39;s major in university is Uyghur, but within half a year, the road to higher education was cut off by Yili&#39;s &quot;re-education&quot;.&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The angle from which he expressed his regrets and lamentations was: &quot;If I have completed four years of study, When I learn the Uyghur language, I can work as a secretary in a commune in southern Xinjiang, and then as a county-level cadre. I will learn more about ethnic relations and human affairs, and then go into historical research and ethnic investigation, and I will be able to organize a full-length novel. But I didn’t have much interest in learning Uyghur during that half year, and I couldn’t see it that far. ”&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;He is psychologically very close to grassland peoples like Kazakhs, and compares himself to “a semi-nomad who is used to yurts and mutton, and loves grasslands and riding horses.” As for Xinjiang, where he grew up, he considered this place his hometown, but he always observed and experienced it based on the roots of the Central Plains culture.&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In the literary critic Wei Qi In Hong&#39;s view, Zhou Tao rarely describes life in the market, nor does he take it as his duty to express the joys, sorrows, joys, and aesthetic tastes of the people. Instead, he tries his best to publicize his own personal life experience. Therefore, his writing also presents a kind of &quot;aristocratic&quot; style. tendency.&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/05/97d629aae0ecf1617113532ed8d97452.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;479&quot; height=&quot;663&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/05/97d629aae0ecf1617113532ed8d97452.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;257111&quot; data-mce- width=&quot;0&quot; data-mce-height=&quot;0&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Looking back on most of his life, Zhou Tao said that he was somewhere between civil and military: Born in the army, it was martial; Background: studying literature and going to school; becoming an athlete and joining martial arts; coming back to school and liking literature and then following literature: after studying literature, he eventually went to the barracks to study literature. They are all nourishing you, and they are all restricting you; restriction is also nourishment. &quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;When he was old, he was considered to be the highest-ranking civilian cadre in the army and enjoyed military-level treatment. On the contrary, his mother, who had been caring for him all his life, heard his son Tao say, &quot;Mom, I&#39;m going to be a general.&quot; He replied, &quot;You haven&#39;t fought a day in a battle, how can you be a general? &quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;&quot;What have the eight years in Kashgar taught you? &quot;I asked him.&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;He replied: &quot;It&#39;s not what you are born with. Your personal conditions must be displayed and expressed under the general trend of a society. Otherwise it&#39;s worthless. &quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;&quot;Are you a fatalist? &quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;He nodded. &quot;Everyone has his own destiny, and destiny is the possibility given to you by society. Those who are courageous but not ignorant are &quot;two poles&quot;, and those who are knowledgeable but not courageous are nerds. Only with courage and luck can you achieve great things. Me and Marvin? It&#39;s not luck, it&#39;s fate. ”&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In an era when the whole family was torn apart by political movements, he questioned: “From being a free boy born in a family, to becoming a person who is influenced by society and his own conditions. Adults embedded in a certain profession, fate, how will you send us? Do you show special favor to us or are you particularly indifferent? Regarding the latter possibility, we were unwilling to consider and could not accept it at that time. ”&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Fifty years have passed, and the answer to the mystery has been completely revealed. What surprised him infinitely was that the answer to today’s mystery had been revealed to him one after another.

The development of farming literature is divided into three stages. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Born out of SLG (strategy) games in the early days, the protagonist, like the player, recruits troops and horses in a different world, completes tasks, and develops the economy or agriculture with the purpose of &quot;building walls high, accumulating food widely, and becoming king slowly&quot; , and continue to expand its own power. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The middle period focuses on the literal meaning, allowing the protagonist to make a fortune in feudal society, and the narrative style becomes warm and peaceful. In addition to &quot;Rebirth of a Little Landlord&quot;, the original work of &quot;Tian Geng Ji&quot;, popular novels such as &quot;Daily Life of Farming and Raising Children in Ancient Mountain Houses&quot; and &quot;I Sell Hotpot in the Song Dynasty&quot; also belong to the category of farming literature in this period. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The style of farming literature and painting in the later period is clear&lt;/span>; Strange. It integrates infinite flow, fantasy, suspense and other factors based on the basic thinking of &quot;farming&quot; to achieve the fusion of genres. For example, &quot;After rebirth as the Dragon King, I make a fortune from seafood&quot;, &quot;I rely on farming to save mankind in the interstellar world&quot; and so on. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If we want to find &lt;span>; a source for farming literature in traditional literature, then the closest source is local literature. Both of them focus on the rural landscape, but the background of rural literature is thick and usually carries narratives of suffering, while farming literature is written in a light and soothing vacuum. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/03/49e2fb8f4e551fbc1fb45b218c4791fe.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;1080&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/03/49e2fb8f4e551fbc1fb45b218c4791fe.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;256831 &quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The road to film and television adaptation of Zhongtian novels has been relatively bumpy. Compared with other web novels with strong conflicts and many reversals, it is actually&lt;/span>; not that suitable for being adapted. onto the screen. What are now being adapted into &quot;farming dramas&quot; are generally medium-term farming dramas that are slow and steady, and are less difficult to shoot than early farming dramas and later farming dramas. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Chef Fang Holding a Pot in the Flower Room&quot; and &quot;&lt;span>;The Sparkling Chef in the World&quot; are relatively successful examples. There are no grudges or resentments, and they only revolve around women pursuing careers. The protagonist unfolds a small incision narrative. Both dramas weakened the farming attributes, amplified the food elements, and used delicious dishes to evoke the audience&#39;s empathetic experience. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/03/79d11908058c277cff63481c61f129db.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;718&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/03/79d11908058c277cff63481c61f129db.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;256832 &quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The annual hit drama &quot;Do you know whether it should be green, fat, red and thin&quot; is adapted from the farming novel of the same name, which tells the story of Sheng Minglan, the concubine of the Sheng family, who uses her intelligence and talent to succeed in the big family. A story of surviving and overcoming the many challenges of life. The drama version deletes the time-travel elements in the original work, making the heroine&#39;s logic of acting according to the rules in a feudal society with strict hierarchies and distinctions between descendants and concubines more consistent. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;&quot;Do You Know&quot; while weakening the farming elements, highlights the family fighting and business elements, and enhances the dramatic conflicts.

If you click on any idol drama, you can get handsome men and beautiful women falling in love in any era and any industry; it is so annoying. Relatives who will not pay for their lives have also watched a lot of costume dramas and urban dramas in recent years, so it is inevitable that they feel the same. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Therefore, it is not difficult to understand that &quot;Tian Geng Ji&quot; was ultimately popular for the seemingly insipid farming line, rather than anything else. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;It can&#39;t help but be reminiscent of &quot;Farming&quot;, a phenomenal variety show in the first half of this year. 10 young guests spent 190 days on 142 acres of land. of sowing and harvesting. Maybe even they themselves didn&#39;t expect that there would be so many viewers willing to watch them farming. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/03/97ce23d7460c454ac135cfad19543d0e.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/03/97ce23d7460c454ac135cfad19543d0e.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;256837 &quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The nostalgia for farming is engraved in the DNA of the Chinese people. Ten years ago, the virtual vegetable growing game QQ Farm became very popular. Some people stayed up late at night and drove to see the sea. Some people got up early and went to bed early just to set the alarm clock and steal vegetables. Ten years later, people moved to WeChat farms, raising chickens, fish and pigeons in the status bar. Turn on your mobile phone, and all major e-commerce platforms have launched virtual services such as watering trees, planting trees, and operating orchards, and linked them to real benefits. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For Chinese people, &quot;farming talent&quot; is an initial skill that can be obtained without &lt;span>; lighting it up. For thousands of years, Chinese society has been dominated by agricultural civilization, which has condensed the wisdom of the working people and given birth to a broad and profound Chinese culture. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Tao Yuanming&#39;s poem &quot;Picking chrysanthemums under the eastern fence, leisurely seeing the Nanshan Mountain&quot; also symbolizes the Chinese people&#39;s pursuit and yearning for pastoral life. New. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Contemporary young people read Tao Yuanming and also pursue farming essays and farming dramas (comprehensive). If the utopian imagination constructed by the former is distant and ethereal, and somewhat unreal through the silk curtain of the times, then the comfort provided by the latter is within reach and approachable. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/03/1f0b0900204242054072a0cdc952588e.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/03/1f0b0900204242054072a0cdc952588e.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;256838 &quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In the era of rapid development, everything&lt;/span>; is rushing forward like clockwork. Young people are rushing forward in the rapid current, but occasionally they also think about it. Take a breather after dinner and look for an emotional outlet. Therefore, slow-paced and beautiful farming dramas are an excellent way to relieve stress. And compared with radical entrepreneurial stories, farming also has a certain sense of security. Every time you work, you will gain, and the effort and reward are generally proportional. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the 1960s, Taiwanese health realism films had a binary opposition of urban or rural narratives, with implicit praise and blame in the beautiful rural scenery. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Today, sixty years later, the &quot;farming flow&quot; actually also hides a certain creative tendency. The countryside is often a healing utopia, while the city is a heterotopia that confused young people want to escape from. . Through a small screen, urbanites can also become farmers remotely. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although the farming literature and farming dramas have shortcomings such as outdated narratives, stereotyped characters, and a slightly dull rhythm, they accurately hit a spreading and popular public sentiment. We might as well give them more room for growth, and I believe there will be more hits. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 05 Nov 2023 12:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[贵人鸟转型卖吃的，国产运动鞋三巨头正在分岔路口]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259989]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-05 11:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 11/04/eaa4eb85be65a96bdaa301cfe2d17880.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;631&quot; height=&quot;841&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/ 23/11/04/eaa4eb85be65a96bdaa301cfe2d17880.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;257037&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As one of the most sought-after items in the fashion circle, the popularity of sneakers is receding. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On September 22, Guirenniao issued an announcement stating that in view of the decline in revenue and continued losses of the sports shoes and apparel business since the judicial reorganization, and the increasingly fierce market competition, the company will end the sports shoes and apparel business that has been in business for 36 years.
