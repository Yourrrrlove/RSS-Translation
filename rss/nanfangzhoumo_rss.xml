Owner. According to the latest report from the joint investigation working group of Chongzhou City (a county-level city under the jurisdiction of Chengdu City): At about 3:00 on October 17, Tang Mou, the owner of the black Rottweiler, arrived at the case. At present, the police have opened a case for investigation into the incident and have taken criminal coercive measures against Tang, the owner of the black Rottweiler dog, in accordance with the law. The case is under further investigation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The video posted online showed a big black dog wandering in the open space in front of the building. As soon as a child and his parents walked out of the corridor, the black dog stepped forward and bit the child. The parents quickly protected the child. , but the big dog threw them both to the ground and continued to bite. It wasn&#39;t until the neighbor brought a mop and stick that the big dog was driven away. On October 16, the Chongzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau reported that in the morning, when Deng and her daughter Tang were walking downstairs in the community, a black dog attacked Tang and bit her. Tang suffered multiple bites all over his body, contusion and laceration on his right kidney, and fractured ribs on his right side. After all-out treatment, the wound debridement surgery was completed and his vital signs were stable. Deng suffered abrasions on his body. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The police have taken criminal coercive measures against the owners of vicious dogs, but this wounding incident has once again reminded us that illegal dog-raising must be severely cracked down on, and we must take precautions before it happens. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, there have been many similar incidents of vicious dogs hurting people recently. In April 2021, a second-grade student in Chongqing was bitten to death by a neighbor&#39;s dog on his way to school, and a pit bull bitten four adults in Huangshi, Hubei; in December 2020, a 3-year-old child was bitten to death by a dog in Hebi, Henan. ; In November, a mother and daughter were bitten by their own dogs in Dujiangyan, Sichuan. The mother died and the daughter was injured...&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some of the dogs that killed and injured people were stray dogs, and many had owners. Raised. Is it because similar incidents occur frequently because there are no regulations regulating dog breeding? No. From the national level, the Animal Epidemic Prevention Law, which will take effect on May 1, 2021, has a special provision for dog breeding, requiring dogs to be vaccinated regularly and to wear dog tags and leashes when taking dogs out of the house. Major cities have already enacted local regulations regulating dog keeping. The Standing Committee of the Chengdu Municipal People&#39;s Congress formulated regulations on the management of dog breeding in 2009, which stipulates that individuals are prohibited from raising aggressive dogs and large dogs. In restricted areas, dogs must be registered with the public security organs and apply for certificates. When taking dogs out of the house, dogs must be put into dog cages and dogs. The dog must be held in a bag or led by a person with full capacity for civil conduct using a dog leash to promptly stop the dog from barking and attacking pedestrians. In 2018, Chengdu police also carried out the work of collecting and disposing of prohibited dogs in restricted areas. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the 2018 police interpretation, the restricted breeding areas in Chengdu include Wuhou District, Chenghua District, Jinniu District, Jinjiang District, Qingyang District and High-tech Zone, as well as restricted breeding areas designated by other districts, cities and counties. It is not clear whether Yangma Street in Chongzhou City, where the vicious dog wounding incident occurred, is a restricted area. Rottweilers that bite people are not among the dog breeds banned in Chengdu’s restricted areas. However, even if it is not illegal to raise a Rottweiler, if the owner allows the dog to roam freely in the public area downstairs, without a leash, without a lead, and fails to stop the dog from attacking others in a timely manner, he must bear corresponding consequences for these actions. legal liability. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The first is civil liability for compensation. The dog owner must bear the medical expenses of the bitten girl and the injured parents, and must also compensate the victim for her mental losses. Being bitten by a vicious dog not only causes serious physical injuries, but also causes huge psychological trauma to young children, and they should receive corresponding compensation. It should be pointed out that China’s mental damage compensation standards have always been on the low side. For example, in the case of a primary school student in Chongqing who was bitten to death, the dog owner only paid 550,000 yuan in compensation. It should be greatly increased so that dog owners who cause harm to others pay a high price. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Dog owners should also bear criminal responsibility. If the injuries suffered by the bitten girl are judged to be minor injuries, the dog owner can be held criminally liable for the crime of intentional wounding (an adult should be presumed to know the consequences of not restraining a vicious dog). If the injury does not amount to minor injuries, you can also be convicted of &quot;crime of endangering public safety&quot; because allowing ferocious dogs to roam freely in public areas has seriously threatened the safety of unspecified members of the public. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What’s more important is that dog-raising laws must be strictly enforced in normal times, and illegal dog-raising behaviors must be severely punished. You cannot always wait until the damage is caused before dealing with it, because it will be too late. If the law stipulates that aggressive dogs and large dogs cannot be kept, dogs must be tethered when taking them out of the house. But in reality, there are quite a few people who keep aggressive dogs and walk their dogs without leashes. Dog-raising management regulations in various places stipulate the management departments for dog-raising behavior. These departments should take responsibility and strictly punish illegal activities in accordance with the law. Those who illegally raise vicious dogs, neglect their management, and allow dogs to roam freely in public places must be strictly punished in accordance with the law. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, the demarcation of restricted areas and prohibited dog breeds in various places should be more detailed and scientific. The Rottweiler that bit people this time is also a violent dog that is banned in Hangzhou, Beijing and other cities, but it is not on the banned list in Chengdu. It is necessary for all localities to delineate the list of prohibited dogs in a more scientific and detailed manner, and at the same time, individuals should be prohibited from keeping aggressive dogs, regardless of whether they are in restricted areas or not. The very few who need care and need to keep aggressive dogs must obtain permission in advance, but the dogs must be kept in captivity and must not be allowed to go out. Violators will be severely punished. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Perhaps it was influenced by the vicious dog bite incident in Chongzhou. Targeted measures such as the &quot;Special Action on Civilized Dog Breeding&quot; have been carried out in many places recently. I especially hope that all parts of the country will take action and continue to do so, so as not to become a gust of wind and &quot;nephew lighting up lanterns&quot; again in a few days. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 17 Oct 2023 21:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[海底捞拒绝给玩偶过生日：应尊重企业的自主经营权丨快评]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258738]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-17 20:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Recently, some netizens posted on online platforms to complain, &quot;Does Haidilao discriminate against people who bring cotton dolls?&quot; , became a hot search topic. The post wrote that when he and his friend each brought a cotton doll to Haidilao for dinner, the waiter showed incomprehensible emotions when he asked for the doll to sit in a baby chair in the store. During the meal, the two also experienced bad experiences such as service that felt like they were being neglected, missing dishes that were not replenished until almost finished, and being rejected by the waiter when they wanted to celebrate the birthday of Cotton Doll. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Cotton dolls are a type of doll that has frequently appeared in the entertainment industry in recent years. By matching clothes and changing hairstyles, you can create a unique and exclusive doll, which is sought after by many young people. Regarding whether the doll can sit in a baby chair, Haidilao customer service said that the company has no relevant regulations and needs to consult the store. Regarding whether it is possible to celebrate the birthday of the doll, the customer service said that it is also necessary to consult the store. &quot;Under normal circumstances, birthdays are celebrated for customers.&quot; This matter has caused waves on the Internet, and it is worthy of discussion and analysis. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Haidilao is well-known in the industry for its &quot;god-like service&quot;. Many unique service categories have also won the reputation of &quot;Haidilao, you can&#39;t learn it&quot;. &quot;Celebrating birthdays for customers&quot; is one of them. As a special service, we even created derivatives such as &quot;Birthday Culture&quot; and &quot;Haidilao Birthday Song&quot;, which have won the favor and recognition of customers. If a customer goes to eat hot pot alone, Haidilao will also place a doll opposite to provide this kind of personalized service to &quot;accompany you when you go to Haidilao alone.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The customer’s behavior of “giving the doll a birthday” may be inspired by this special service. There is no shortage of posts on social media about &quot;birthday for Cotton Doll&quot;, and there are also popular posts that read &quot;Waiters are forced to stay open&quot;. The person involved this time also mentioned this in the article. I am afraid that he did this after seeing similar &quot;experience posts&quot;, intending to follow the same example and enjoy Haidilao&#39;s birthday service. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But the question is, do waiters have an obligation to be &quot;forced to open for business&quot;? Obviously, there is a difference between &quot;can&quot; and &quot;should.&quot; Haidilao &quot;can&quot; celebrate the birthdays of previous cotton dolls, but it does not mean that they &quot;should&quot; celebrate the birthdays of future cotton dolls. It can also be seen from Haidilao&#39;s response to this incident that they only have a service habit of &quot;celebrating birthdays for guests&quot;, but they do not have a service commitment of &quot;celebrating birthdays for guests&#39; dolls&quot;. Celebrating a doll’s birthday is not written into Haidilao’s service contract, nor is it an agreed-upon special service. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After all, Haidilao is just a catering company. Its main business is to provide catering services to customers, providing consumers with a variety of drinks, food, consumption venues and facilities, integrating &quot;instant processing and production, commercial sales and Service labor&quot; in one. Unique and special services are additional &quot;add-ons&quot; and are no different from marketing methods such as discount coupons, consumption coupons, and membership coupons. In addition to birthday celebrations, Haidilao also provides free manicures, free snacks and other special services, which all fall within the scope of the merchant&#39;s independent operating rights. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In other words, Haidilao’s starting point for providing these special services is to enhance customers’ consumption experience, increase the reputation of its own brand, and bring positive feedback to business operations. However, these special services are a matter of affection, not duty. Therefore, Haidilao certainly has the right to operate independently on &quot;how to provide goods or services&quot; and has the right to adjust the rules and scope of special services. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, Haidilao has also made many adjustments, such as canceling free beef cubes, canceling free manicures in some stores, requiring at least one pot base to be ordered, no longer allowing bring-in dishes, etc. Similar measures have triggered great discussions, but they still fall within the scope of autonomous business rights and do not involve public interests such as food safety. Haidilao has the right to decide how to adjust the transaction rules, and customers also have the right to decide whether to come and consume. Everything will be left to the market to judge and let consumers choose. There is room for two-way choices between the two parties. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is not difficult to imagine that if the waiter really fulfills the client&#39;s wish and gives the cotton doll a &quot;birthday and a doll chair&quot;, then it may also squeeze out the opportunity for customers with children to obtain the doll chair service. , or push up Haidilao’s operating costs. If some kind of incentive is formed, more dolls and even pets will celebrate their birthdays. Who will bear the rising costs? If the dining environment is regressive for ordinary customers, it is a lose-lose situation for both Haidilao and ordinary customers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Therefore, the party’s “let me go” mentality displayed between the lines of the text is also suspected of emotional blackmail: asking the merchant to provide special services that it is not obliged to provide, or even It is also unreasonable to satisfy its emotional value and cater to certain preferences of subcultural groups. Haidilao naturally has the right to refuse certain excessive or unreasonable requests. The parties concerned can look for restaurants willing to provide such services, or simply organize their own friends to open a Cotton Doll themed hot pot restaurant at their own risk and bear their own profits and losses. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, even if it is &quot;celebrating a customer&#39;s birthday&quot;, members and non-members can enjoy different services in Haidilao. After all, the cotton doll is not a real baby, and the store has the right to decide whether to treat the two-dimensional and three-dimensional dolls equally. In short, the &quot;controversial points&quot; in this incident are still within the scope of independent management rights. &quot;Whether to celebrate Cotton Doll&#39;s birthday&quot; should be left to Haidilao itself to decide. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 17 Oct 2023 20:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[第134届广交会开幕，展览总面积、展位数和参展企业数量均创历史新高]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258741]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-17 19:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;On October 16, 2023, in Guangzhou, Guangdong, two overseas buyers visited the Canton Fair venue The bustling crowd inside took photos in the background.&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/17/218f8aca90.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height =&quot;721&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/17/218f8aca90.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254274&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot; color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On October 16, 2023, in Guangzhou, Guangdong, two overseas buyers took a group photo with the bustling crowds in the Canton Fair venue as the background. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On October 15, 2023, the 134th China Import and Export Fair (Canton Fair) was officially launched.

That scenery is my hometown in a previous life. This feeling is very strong and real.&quot; Tanimura said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1980, this feeling became the creative inspiration of Shinji Tanimura. He wrote his most famous masterpiece &quot;Subaru&quot; (also called &quot;Subaru&quot;) in the future. In China, fans are accustomed to (called &quot;Star&quot;): I closed my eyes, my heart was at a loss, I looked up sadly, my eyes were full of desolation, there was only one road leading to the wilderness... I will travel far, see you again, the Pleiades hang high! ——The Pleiades star cluster is located in the constellation Taurus and consists of more than 3,000 stars. It is extremely bright in the night sky and is especially dazzling in autumn and winter. The brighter ones form the Pleiades. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In May 1980, this song was included in the album of the same name. On the album cover, a line of light and shadow cuts across the darkness. Half of Tanimura&#39;s body is buried in the darkness, and half of his body stretches out from the light. He nods slightly, eyes fixed forward, and is ready to go. This song has a melancholy tone, bleak lyrics, and sad images, but its perspective is bright. After the song came out, it became very popular in Japan and sold more than 600,000 copies. In 1987, Shinji Tanimura participated in Japan&#39;s annual &quot;Red and White Song Festival&quot; for the first time, singing &quot;Subaru&quot;, and the TV ratings exceeded 63%. Since then, he has participated in the &quot;Red and White Song Gala&quot; for many years and has become a veteran singer in this most representative show at the end of the year in Japan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In September 1980, the ATV TV series &quot;The Love of the Earth&quot; was launched. In early 1981, singer Guan Zhengjie included the Cantonese version of &quot;Star&quot; in his TV original soundtrack album &quot;The Love of the Earth&quot;, with lyrics written by Zheng Guojiang . In 1982, Teresa Teng sang the Japanese and Cantonese versions of &quot;Star&quot; at the Elizabeth Stadium concert in Hong Kong. As a result, this song became popular in southern China and radiated to the north. Singer Shen Xiaocen included the Japanese version of &quot;Star&quot; in his second album. Since then, this song has been covered by singers such as Alan Tam, Xu Xiaofeng, Feng Feifei, Han Baoyi, and Cheng Lin. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A friend told Shinji Tanimura that the picture in his mind seemed to depict Northeast China, so going to China became his dream. &quot;I have always wanted to visit China, but I don&#39;t know why. But I know that as long as I go, I will understand why I want to go to China.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http ://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/17/ErfVwIuysKLtiuXt85wPVpvEalqyFAaBsvloZd0K.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm .com/cms/medias/image/23/10/17/ErfVwIuysKLtiuXt85wPVpvEalqyFAaBsvloZd0K.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254292&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;2004 On November 5, 2019, Shinji Tanimura participated in the &quot;Jewel Heart&quot; Shanghai Concert&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1981, Tanimura Shinji participated in the &quot;Hand in Hand Beijing&quot; concert held at Beijing Workers&#39; Stadium with Chinese singers. He recalled that as soon as he landed at the Chinese airport, he felt like going home. &quot;Even the earthy smell that hit my face felt very familiar. .&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The concert lasted for two days. At this time, pop music was in its infancy in China. The tens of thousands of spectators in the work hall sat in silence, with no applause or cheers. They were used to the warm live atmosphere in Japan. Tani Cun was very uncomfortable with it. He and the members of his rock band Alice tried every means to mobilize the audience. After they sang a rhythmic song, people in the venue stood up and applauded continuously. Shinji Tanimura was very excited: &quot;Everyone feels the same about music, and music has no national boundaries.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He sang &quot;Subaru&quot; live. This was the beginning of his singing reaching the ears of Chinese audiences. So far, nearly 50 of his works have been adapted into Chinese songs, including Leslie Cheung&#39;s &quot;Who Resonates&quot; (adapted from &quot;Like a Dream&quot;), Anita Mui&#39;s &quot;Walking Alone&quot; (adapted from &quot;This&amp;nbsp;is&amp;nbsp;my&amp;nbsp;trial&quot;) &quot;), Jacky Cheung&#39;s &quot;The Distant Her&quot; (adapted from &quot;Romantic Railway&quot;), Priscilla Chan&#39;s &quot;Forgetting Sorrow&quot; (adapted from &quot;Autumn Stoppers&quot;)...&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http: //images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/17/ggCgEZS20DHJmkrzEv4rKCSqGjdClLEWCol2l890.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;597&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm. com/cms/medias/image/23/10/17/ggCgEZS20DHJmkrzEv4rKCSqGjdClLEWCol2l890.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254294&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;2007 On September 20, in Nantong, Jiangsu, at the opening ceremony of the 9th China Asian Arts Festival and the Gala &quot;Under the Same Starry Sky&quot;, Shinji Tanimura sang &quot;Flower&quot; &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>; (Visual China/Photo) &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2001, Shinji Tanimura, who was already successful, came to the Yellow River specifically to try to find similar feelings from his childhood, but found nothing. From this, he became more certain that the scene should be near Heilongjiang in Northeast China. Tanimura said with a smile: &quot;Maybe I was Chinese in my previous life.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2003, China suffered from the SARS epidemic. In order to help China fight against SARS, Shinji Tanimura held a &quot;Concert to Support China in Fighting SARS&quot; in Osaka and donated all the 15.34 million yen (approximately US$120,000) raised to the Red Cross Society of China. After SARS ended, he flew to China and held a concert to thank medical workers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the 2010 Shanghai World Expo, Teng Junjie, the chief director of the opening and closing ceremonies, invited Tanimura to perform on stage at the opening ceremony, and Tanimura agreed. For this reason, he canceled several performances in Japan and made compensation. On the evening of April 30, 2010, at the Shanghai World Expo Cultural Center, Asian girls walked out from both sides holding stars in their hands. They complemented the lights of the audience and seemed to stretch out into a galaxy. Shinji Tanimura, China&#39;s overseas promotion ambassador for the 2010 Shanghai World Expo, brought the audience to the audience. The familiar classic song &quot;Subaru&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Teng Junjie and Tani Cun have been friends for nearly 20 years. He recalled in an interview: &quot;When Abe and Koizumi were in office, (Japan) had trouble getting along with China, he went directly to Koizumi and told him that his attitude towards China must change. Japan must stand with China, and we two Asian countries must Take this responsibility.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tanimura is very willing to spend time face-to-face with young Chinese people. In March 2004, the Shanghai Conservatory of Music hired Shinji Tanimura as permanent professor of the Department of Music Engineering and consultant of the Sino-Japanese Music Culture Research Center. This job lasted until 2008. While serving as a visiting professor at the Shanghai Conservatory of Music, Shinji Tanimura spent one week every month in Shanghai. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The theme of Tanimura&#39;s class is &quot;How to express music.&quot; Start with the lyrics first. A reporter visited his class. Tanimura entered the classroom, first put half a glass of water on the table, pushed the glass over, and the water came out. He asked the students to write lyrics about it. He left the classroom for 20 minutes and came back to check. The lyrics of a classmate impressed him deeply: When water flows outside, water never knows what its own shape is... &quot;The most important thing is the inner feeling. Only there are people, and I am. If people want to be connected, music is The best medium. Music can best enter people&#39;s hearts, resonate and move, and hearts can meet.&quot; Shinji Tanimura told the reporter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The inspiration and core of the song &quot;Subaru&quot; became one of the important narratives of Shinji Tanimura&#39;s future life. As written in the song, he has always felt that &quot;starlight leads the way.&quot; When the 32-year-old Tanimura composed this song, he had no idea of ​​its vast magic, which could transcend time and travel through space, and continue to echo throughout his artistic career. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;At that time, Japan&#39;s economy was developing rapidly, giving people the illusion that as long as they had money, they could buy everything. But this song tells people: truly precious things need to be felt with the heart. Care, tenderness , consideration, love, etc., these invisible things are crucial to us.&quot; Tanimura said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For more than 40 years, he has performed and visited various Asian countries and often heard local people singing this song, regardless of gender, young or old. The other person even thought it was the song of his own country. He was once asked: &quot;Do you know this song?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;&quot;Subaru&quot; is the key to opening the door to all Asia and can connect everyone together. .&quot; Tanimura said, &quot;There is no doubt that &quot;Subaru&quot; changed my life. This song took me on a magnificent journey.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http:// images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/17/ySeRpyen0Uwh75lRWyAvnWYQHCCcx08ReNwaKxuB.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;589&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/ cms/medias/image/23/10/17/ySeRpyen0Uwh75lRWyAvnWYQHCCcx08ReNwaKxuB.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254293&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Shinji Tanimura and Teresa Teng Singing on the same stage &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>; (video screenshot/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Showa &quot;Legendary&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; On September 21, 2018, Shinji Tanimura, who was almost 70 years old, held the &quot;38th Year of Stars&quot; concert at the Shanghai Grand Theater. At the age of 25, Tanimura&#39;s hairline began to recede, and he began to grow a beard to achieve visual balance on his face. Nearly 45 years have passed, and his works have stayed at a certain point like his hairline, becoming synonymous with his achievements. And his voice is inevitably aging like his hair color. His beard and hair are all white. Even if he sings &quot;Pleiades&quot; with exactly the same arrangement, you can hear the decline in function, but there are gains and losses. At this time, It has the mellowness and sweetness given by age. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tanimura Shinji grew up and became famous during the Showa period, and he has obvious Showa characteristics. Shinji Tanimura appears in public and has a decent image. He always had a smile on his face, and his eight teeth were gleaming white. He is diligent, confident, vigorous and friendly, and uses subtle strokes to outline the complexity of the grand narrative. Since his debut, he has held 3,620 concerts in Japan and is still the number one in Japan. He has released 63 albums and 62 singles, with a total sales volume of more than 30 million. He is called the godfather of the Japanese music industry. In the media description, he always promotes Sino-Japanese friendship from the bottom of his heart, cultivates young people with full expectations, and pours his blood into music. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Perhaps partly due to the language barrier, Chinese reporters said his voice was soft and slow. If you don’t prick up your ears to distinguish it carefully, it may even be masked by the sound of the indoor air conditioner. &quot;People are as quiet as songs.&quot; But if you listen to his works and understand his experience, both the premise and the conclusion of this sentence will be invalid. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1948, Shinji Tanimura was born in Osaka. When he was a child, he was overweight and was nicknamed &quot;Fat Pig&quot; by his classmates. His self-esteem was greatly affected. When he was in elementary school, he heard singer Xiao Linxu singing &quot;Migratory Bird&quot; in a performance. He was attracted by Xiao Linxu&#39;s gesture of strumming the guitar and started learning guitar, deciding to regain his confidence. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1965, he formed the band Rock Candie with his classmates. Their style was more country folk and their rebellious playing style made the audience feel novel. In 1970, this band held an &quot;American Continent Tour&quot;. They first arrived in Vancouver. Because they were too poor, they had to take a bus across the North American continent all the way to New York. After ten days of tossing, they finally reached their destination. In New York, Shinji Tanimura watched a local rock performance. He shed tears at Janis Joplin&#39;s performance, &quot;It turns out that music still has such a possibility.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After returning to China, He formed a new band, Alice, but the band&#39;s American blues style was not accepted by the Japanese audience. Alice had to perform in various places to meet daily expenses and continue her acting career. During her frequent performances, Alice set a record of holding 303 concerts a year. As the band&#39;s popularity expanded in various places, their songs such as &quot;Winter Thunder and Lightning&quot; and &quot;The Pledge of Tears&quot; also gradually became popular. In 1978, they became the first group of Japanese artists to successfully hold a three-day concert at Nippon Budokan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/17/Ampapw9ET99MTYyV8EyROgmZOTbNC7vffFfSy6l6.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/17/Ampapw9ET99MTYyV8EyROgmZOTbNC7vffFfSy6l6.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254291&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On September 28, 2018, in Beijing, Shinji Tanimura held the &quot;38 Years of Stars&quot; concert &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>; (Visual China/Photo) &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In November 1974, Shinji Tanimura&#39;s first solo album &quot;蜜&quot; was released. He wrote the lyrics and music for the entire album. One year later, in December, Tanimura Shinji released his second solo album &quot;Umimako&quot;. In this quiet work, there are many shining works, such as &quot;Port Lights&quot;, &quot;Sunflower&quot;, &quot;Warmth&quot;, &quot;Sunset&quot;, &quot;The Road of Sand&quot;... After entering the 1980s, Tanimura produced more and more excellent works. In the 1990s, the theme song &quot;Fengzihuaden&quot; of Toei animation &quot;Three Kingdoms&quot; was released, and &quot;Hometown&quot;, a collaboration with singer and actor Yuzo Kayama... are all Widespread. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tanimura’s life is very interesting. After a concert, he once walked into a small bookstore and offered himself to collect money for the store manager while he was having dinner. Fans who come to the bookstore after listening to Tanimura&#39;s concert will receive an oncoming surprise when paying. In Japanese variety shows in the 1990s, he was experienced, relaxed, unencumbered, and spoke humorously. One second he was not ashamed to share his embarrassing story with the host: due to a bad gastrointestinal condition, the stool collapsed in his pants when he farted; the next second he picked up the guitar and taught them his valuable experience in the music industry for many years: the most important thing is the song Express your heart, not whether it can be passed down to the world or how many people will sing it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In his later years, Tanimura conducted a deeper exploration of musical expression. The subtleties of his singing have been accurate to every modal word. In the song &quot;Woo Hu&quot;, he poured different techniques into each &quot;ah&quot; to achieve the emotions he expected, such as the feelings in his heart that he wanted to suppress but couldn&#39;t. Sigh while staying. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2017, Tanimura held a concert &quot;Commemorating the 45th Anniversary of the Normalization of Diplomatic Relations between China and Japan - 2017 Shinji Tanimura&#39;s 45th Anniversary of His Performing Career in Shanghai&quot; at the Shanghai Grand Theater. At the scene, a beam of chasing light hit the side of the stage and enveloped an empty chair. The prelude of &quot;Restaurant Corner&quot; sounded, and on the other side of the stage, Tanimura picked up the microphone and said: &quot;Next, I will sing a set of narrative love songs for everyone...&quot; &quot;Narrative Love Songs&quot; is his new attempt ——&quot;Explain&quot; the ins and outs of creating the song at the beginning of each song by chatting and heart-to-heart with the audience. In a set of five &quot;narrative love songs&quot;, Tanimura uses the woman&#39;s mood and the man&#39;s perspective to connect the ups and downs of love emotions, just like a love short film. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To commemorate the &quot;two 45th anniversaries&quot;, Tanimura released a set of three albums called &quot;Standard&quot;, each with 15 songs, for a total of 45 songs. The first album is representative works selected from the songs he composed; the second album is taken from Alice&#39;s period works; and the third album is Japanese classic songs sung by him. His criteria for selecting tracks to enter this album are: &quot;Children 100 years from now will think that these works are indeed classics.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These tracks are also arranged in the order of the ups and downs of life and the ups and downs of emotions. The first part is full of ambition, and in the end there will be a starry reverie like &quot;Pleiades&quot;: &quot;A person&#39;s daily life must be ups and downs, but he will not stick to these emotions and feelings every day. Life and music have something in common . I want to reflect the ups and downs of life into music... Even if the melody on the stage is occasionally sad and disappointing, it must be exciting and upward in the end!&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;September 28, 2018, The &quot;38th Year of Stars&quot; concert in Beijing became Shinji Tanimura&#39;s last public performance in China. On October 8, 2023, Shinji Tanimura died of illness at the age of 74. The funeral was held on October 15, with only close relatives in attendance. On October 16, the news of his death was made public. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(Comprehensive reports from Global Figures, The Paper, Xinmin Evening News, etc.)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br >;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/ a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 17 Oct 2023 18:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[2023年前8个月基本医保基金收入同比增长9.3%]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258746]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-17 17:30:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;The National Medical Insurance Administration recently released data showing that from January to August 2023, the basic medical insurance fund (including maternity insurance ) total revenue was 2.092333 billion yuan, a year-on-year increase of 9.3%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among them, the income of the basic medical insurance fund for employees (including maternity insurance) was 1.473806 billion yuan, a year-on-year increase of 13%; the income of the basic medical insurance fund for urban and rural residents was 618.527 billion yuan, a year-on-year increase of 1.3%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Data show that from January to August 2023, the total expenditure of the basic medical insurance fund (including maternity insurance) was 1.786477 billion yuan, a year-on-year increase of 18.3%.

In the history of the Nobel Prize, it is the class with the second most female winners and the second highest proportion. In 2009, there were the most female award winners, with 5 women winning the award, accounting for the highest proportion of 38% (5/13, a total of 13 people won the award that year). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This year&#39;s four female winners are Katalin Karikó, the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine; Anne L&#39;Huillier, the Physics Prize ); Narges Mohammadi for the Peace Prize and Claudia Goldin for the Economics Prize. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Interestingly, the achievement that won the economics prize was the study of gender differences. US economist Claudia Goldin was awarded the prize for her research on key drivers of gender differences in women&#39;s participation in the labor market. The award citation said her research &quot;has advanced our understanding of women&#39;s labor market outcomes&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In layman’s terms, Goldin won the award for studying why women’s income is not as good as men’s. This can be seen as the gender difference in labor remuneration between men and women. Gender differences exist in all aspects of social life, and even the winning of Nobel Prizes has huge gender differences. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Golding not only studies the difference in income between men and women, but even after winning the award, he complained that there were more men than women in the economics prize. She said that &quot;serious inequality still exists&quot; between men and women in the Nobel Prize in Economics. Indeed, Goldin is the third female economist to win the Economics Prize. From 1969 (the Nobel Prize in Economics began to be awarded in 1969) to 2023, the Nobel Prize in Economics has been awarded 55 times, with a total of 93 winners, of which women account for only 3.2%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Looking at the Nobel Prize comprehensively from the statistical data on the Nobel Prize official website, the gender gap between men and women winning prizes is also quite disparate. From 1901 to 2023, the Nobel Prize was awarded a total of 621 times, with 970 individuals and 30 organizations (groups) winning the prize, and a total of 1,000 people and organizations winning the prize. Among them, 65 are women. Looking at individual proportions, the proportion of women is about 6.7% (65/970). However, if we consider that Marie Curie won the award twice (in 1903 for Physics and 1911 for Chemistry), only 64 women won the award, so the actual proportion is 6.6% (64/970). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Looking at the various Nobel Prize categories, due to wars and various reasons, different Nobel Prize categories in history have had different awards and number of winners. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since 1901, the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine has been awarded 114 times, with a total of 227 winners, of which 13 were women, accounting for 5.7%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Physics Prize was awarded 117 times, with 225 winners, of which 5 were female winners, accounting for 2.2%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Chemistry Prize was awarded 115 times, with 194 winners, of which 8 were female winners, accounting for 4.1%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Literature Prize was awarded 116 times, with 120 winners, of which 17 were female winners, accounting for 14.2%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Peace Prize has been awarded 104 times, with 141 winners, of which 19 were female winners, accounting for 13.5%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Looking at the six awards, the highest proportion of female winners is the Literature Award, which is 14.2%, and the lowest is the Physics Award, where women account for 2.2%. The economics prize that Golding complained about is considered good. Women account for 3.2%, which is not the bottom. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Why is the proportion of female winners so low? Looking at the total number, they only account for 10.3%. In this regard, Goldin analyzed that the reasons why women earn less than men can also be used to explain. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although Goldin believes that there are many reasons for the gender pay gap, such as gender discrimination, she coined a term - greed for work to explain it, believing that this is the main reason. Greedy work is when a person works longer hours or has less control over their hours and is paid disproportionately more per hour, effectively penalizing women who need to seek flexible labor. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, this situation also creates a lose-lose situation for both sexes. For men, they give up time with their families, while for women, they often give up their careers. The essence is that many jobs pay much higher hourly rates when working longer hours, being on call, busy schedules, evenings and weekends, or unpredictable hours. However, in most couples who are highly educated, have careers and children, the woman is the on-call professional at home, and the man is the on-call professional at work. Therefore, men earn more than women. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The reason behind this is that women have to have children and take care of the family, so they have less time to work, and of course their income is less than men. If this reason is used to explain why women have only accounted for 10.3% of Nobel Prize winners over the past 100 years, it is also valid. Because women devote less time to work and research than men, this prevents them from achieving higher achievements in different fields and therefore winning Nobel Prizes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Whenever career and work achieve results, one is talent and the other is diligence. There may be different opinions on the proportion of the two, but it cannot be denied that diligence is the most important factor in producing results. factor. &quot;A person who is capable of one thing can benefit himself by a hundred, and a person who is capable of ten can benefit himself by a thousand.&quot; This is the true meaning of it. As long as you engage in a job or profession, and persevere over a long period of time, practice makes perfect and results will come. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The importance of professional perseverance can also be seen from the history of the Nobel Prize. As long as women participate in scientific research and work, the chances and number of awards will increase. From 1901 to 1925, 4 women won the award; from 1926 to 1950, 8 women won the award; from 1951 to 1975, 3 women won the award; from 1976 to 2000, 15 women won the award Award-winning, from 2001 to 2023, 35 women won the award. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In comparison, in the 50 years from 1901 to 1950, 12 women won the award, but in the 22 years from 2001 to 2023, 35 women won the award. This not only shows that the number of female award-winners has increased with the development of the times, but also shows that modern women’s large-scale participation in work and scientific research is an important reason why they can achieve the same results and win awards as men. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These explanations and facts are also reflected in Golding&#39;s research. In her latest book, &quot;Career and Family: Women&#39;s Centennial Journey to Equality,&quot; she mentions the impact of multiple factors on women&#39;s careers, such as the history of women&#39;s pursuit of careers and families, coeducation in higher education, and the impact of birth control pills on women&#39;s careers. The impact of women&#39;s career and marriage decisions, women&#39;s married surnames as a social indicator, and the reasons why women make up the majority of undergraduate students. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Goldin analyzes more than two hundred years of data to demonstrate how and why gender differences in earnings and employment rates have changed, such as the use of birth control pills, which has provided new insights into women&#39;s career plans. opportunities, giving them more time and opportunity to work and participate in scientific research, so that they can achieve the same results as men, and these results may win the Nobel Prize. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Therefore, receiving higher education, participating in work and scientific research are important foundations for women to gradually win more Nobel Prizes and increase their income. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 17 Oct 2023 16:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[独臂船长徐京坤和他的超级赛船丨封面人物]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258546]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-17 15:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/11/3KlQURn8IAiq75Cy8HWajQ9l7ECu7pLrtLJOg8Ig.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/3KlQURn8IAiq75Cy8HWajQ9l7ECu7pL rtLJOg8Ig. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253648&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On September 23, 2023, at Qingdao Olympic Sailing Center, Xu Jingkun sailed a sailboat out to sea&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern People Weekly reporter Liang Chen/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the autumn of 2021, Xu Jingkun decided to buy a super racing boat to participate in the 2024 Vendée Singles.

This is the first time a Chinese team has been selected for the world&#39;s top two-person transoceanic competition, and it is also the first Asian team in the history of Coffee Road. Although the Café Road is not one of the five single qualifying events designated by Vendée Globe, it, like other world-renowned high-difficulty championships, can help racing boats accumulate difficult sailing miles. When the team that has obtained Vendée Globe qualification review exceeds the limit When the quota is determined, help the team win in the competition of selecting the best among the best.

He himself does not take it too seriously. Only when he talks about his identity as &quot;rowing captain&quot;, he is full of pride. . &quot;Although I used to sail my own boats and others called me &#39;captain&#39; very early on, in my mind, I didn&#39;t really consider myself a captain until I drove IMOCA60 and managed the racing team.&quot;&lt;/p >; &lt;p>;IMOCA60 is the designated boat type for the 2024 Vendée Globe. In 2007, Xu Jingkun was training overseas in Rhode Island, USA as a member of the Chinese Disabled Sailing Team. He saw the IMOCA racing boat on the cover of a sailing magazine for the first time. &quot;It&#39;s so dreamy, like a spaceship!&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/esXSHu2ovTOfUKr558ukBPh2CzYb143BbZNgzYBv.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/esXSHu2ovTOfUKr558ukBPh2CzYb143BbZNgzYBv.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253646 &quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Xu Jingkun gathered with friends at the restaurant bar where he worked back then&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern Characters Weekly reporter Liang Chen/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;With the continuous upgrade of IMOCA racing performance, traveling around the world in 80 days has long since become a reality from science fiction. The route of the Vendée Globe is not the most economical and safe trade wind route. Instead, it tries its best to incorporate dangerous capes, equatorial windless zones, and stormy waves into the course. Even so, there have been five captains in the history of the Vendée Globe. After reaching the 80-day mark, the fastest record is 74 days, 3 hours, 35 minutes and 46 seconds. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xu Jingkun never thought that one day after the Paralympic sailing team was disbanded, he would go out to sea alone, own a super racing boat, and race against the waves with the captains of the world&#39;s top professional racing boats. In 2021, there are less than 20 hydrofoil super single-hull racing boats in the world. Standing on the boat, he had a strong sense of unreality. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;IMOCA60 integrates the most cutting-edge monohull sailboat design and shipbuilding technology. The signature design is the swinging keel inserted vertically into the sea and the hydrofoils extending from both sides of the hull. The carbon fiber hydrofoils are light and elegant but strong enough to When standing in the wind, it looks like the wings of a flying fish, helping the ship reduce the friction of the water and achieve faster speeds. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/igg3a26AZN6NW6OYjC1NyCVraXPlAaupJur759F5.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/igg3a26AZN6NW6OYjC1NyCVraXPlAaupJur759F5.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253641&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Xu Jingkun and his wife Xiao Shuyao in their first year of circumnavigation&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo provided by interviewee)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p >; &lt;p>;It can sail unimpeded in the world&#39;s dangerous sea areas and harsh sea conditions, with a maximum instantaneous speed of more than 40 knots (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: italics, italics_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;1 knot Equivalent to 1 nautical mile per hour, which is 1.852 kilometers per hour&lt;/span>;). If captains want to stay ahead of others in the Vendée Globe, they must maintain an average boat speed of more than 20 knots day and night for several months. The resistance of sea water, the load of ships and the attack of storms mean that the optimal speed of modern warships can only be about 30 knots. For a full carbon fiber monohull ship, traveling at such a speed in the deep sea is already equivalent to traveling at sea. Driving an F1 car. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Before I boarded a ship for the first time, I had never experienced it in real life. I only learned about it from watching videos. When I got on board, I found that the ship was really ‘flying’ on the sea.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since Xu Jingkun was selected into the Chinese Disabled Sailing Team in 2005, he has been constantly exposed to various types of boats. He has completed extreme challenges such as a solo circumnavigation of the China Sea and a non-stop solo transatlantic crossing in a 6.5-meter boat. He also used it with his wife Xiao Shuyao. It took three years for the Chinese to complete the first catamaran circumnavigation of the world. &quot;Among the many boats I have sailed before, none of them can compare with it. It is a completely different concept.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; A brand-new IMOCA60 sells for more than nine million euros. He bought a second-hand boat with excellent performance for &quot;only&quot; two to three million euros. Parking the ship at the pier of the port of Lorient, France, he carefully hung a sign on the bow to remind passing ships to keep their distance, &quot;Don&#39;t touch my ship, I can&#39;t repair it.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p >;From then to now, he is always short of money. “The money on hand is not enough to overhaul a racing boat.” The money to buy the boat is sponsored by various brothers who love sailing. “I have never had a dedicated business team to help I found all the big sponsors myself.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When he bought the boat, he insisted on going to France alone. &quot;I didn&#39;t even bring any luggage, I just carried a backpack.&quot; He had already done it.

In his words, &quot;Buy The boat is the first step. To maintain the racing boat every offseason, you have to spend money to buy a boat.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The labor cost alone for a large racing team is one to two hundred per season. 10,000 euros, &quot;We have kept the funds to a minimum.

It was the &quot;Chinese feast&quot; that the two had in the port of Brittany, France.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xiao Shuyao never thought that Seeing that Xu Jingkun complained about suffering, Xu Jingkun said nothing and secretly marveled in his heart, &quot;Actually, I often think about it now. She has not been suffering like me since she was a child. Why can she suffer like this with me? ”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When Xu Jingkun was 12 years old, he was injured in an accident. Two-thirds of his left hand and left forearm were amputated. His brain deleted many painful memories out of self-protection. He only remembered being carried away. On the stretcher going to the hospital, a fellow countryman’s voice sounded in my ear, “This child is useless! ”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since 2015, the competitions Xu Jingkun has participated in have been the world’s top offshore sailing competitions. There is no special preferential treatment for people with disabilities. He must prove that he has the same competitive ability as normal people to be qualified. &lt; /p>; &lt;p>;Xiao Shuyao once asked him why he had such a difficult journey but never thought of giving up, &quot;Because I have no way out. When I retreat, I just say, &#39;This kid is useless!&#39; &#39;&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/7V9ZkmW2b7jpDZyeanHEPJMDCt4IYAkAAAn2hCQC.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/7V9ZkmW2b7jpDZyeanHEPJMDCt4IYAkAAAn2hCQC.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253654&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style= &quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Electricity, machinery, hydraulics, structural maintenance, and sail painting are all Xu Jingkun&#39;s jobs. What requires the most physical strength is cleaning the bottom of the boat twice a week. Two or three hours &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(provided by interviewee/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Defeat to the angry sea&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Xiao Shuyao and Xu Jingkun were just in When we were together, many friends around me didn’t understand, but as soon as I got in contact with them, they would naturally forget that Xu Jingkun was missing an arm, “My friends said he didn’t feel disabled. &quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xu Jingkun always naturally exposes his left arm, using it to hold his mobile phone to make calls and hold the microphone during sharing meetings, &quot;I can cut vegetables and meat, and I can also make dumplings... …Many times when I fell into the sea, I relied on it to hold me up. It’s great! It followed me really hard and this is my mark. &quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xiao Shuyao believes that sailing cured Xu Jingkun, &quot;He has encountered numerous doubts and accusations, which stimulated him to a certain extent and gave him a desire to fight when he set sail. As the voyage progressed, he felt more and more care, help, and kindness. He became peaceful and rational, and his voyage became more pure. ”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xu Jingkun agreed, “Sailing has completely changed me. &quot;Since entering the sports school at the age of 16, he has always felt insecure in competition. &quot;If it weren&#39;t for sports, you wouldn&#39;t be able to get out at all, so I would say that I must stay here. He often had the fear of falling into hopelessness. He was once very angry. When he was participating in the Paralympic team selection, he said to himself every day, &quot;If you fail this time, you don&#39;t have to go back. You can just jump into the sea and die.&quot; . &quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the Paralympic team was disbanded, he couldn&#39;t find his life goal for a long time. He hated a life without a sense of goal. Captain Zhai Mo&#39;s return from a global voyage gave him a direction, &quot;It turns out that the team After disbanding, I can still sail on my own. ”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;His first ship and first voyage around the China Sea were full of tragedy. “A man lived alone in a small shipyard in Laoshan, busy like a madman every day, separated from life, and lost everything.” Contact may even seem to be starting to be forgotten. &quot;He spent more than 7 months repairing and renovating an almost abandoned ship and named it &quot;Dream&quot;. He set sail from Qingdao on September 18, 2012, &quot;taking the brave man away and never returning it. That kind of tragic mood, even with some resentment, why does my life have to be so difficult? Why couldn&#39;t my parents come to the scene when I set sail? If you don’t believe it, I will fight to the death! With such energy! &quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fa Xiao &quot;Monkey&quot; shouted on the shore, &quot;Jingkun! &quot;Jingkun!&quot; &quot;Oh, he yelled so sadly, I didn&#39;t dare to look back. I was gambling with fate in my heart. If I die, I will die. What&#39;s going on?&quot; ”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/4AwubDVqVgNDKraQShoUGUTLCudu23xeqOlwKoPZ.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height =&quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/4AwubDVqVgNDKraQShoUGUTLCudu23xeqOlwKoPZ.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253652&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot; color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Electricity, machinery, hydraulics, structural maintenance, and sail painting are all Xu Jingkun&#39;s jobs. What requires the most physical strength is cleaning the bottom of the ship twice a week. It takes two hours to wait in the water. Three hours &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(provided by interviewee/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Courage and Love&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In these years, when Xu Jingkun completed a Another goal. After feeling that he could take control of his life, his worries receded and his anger subsided. He became more and more relaxed and more professional. Friends, elder brothers and sponsors around him did not know much about him at the beginning of his career. Many people knew him through Xiao Shuyao. It was only after writing his book &quot;The Humble Dreamer&quot; that I learned about those past experiences.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I read that book carefully and was very touched. &quot;Yin Zhicheng is the deputy general manager of the Dolphin Club of Qingdao Maritime Vocational School and has come into contact with many sailing people. &quot;Jingkun is very focused and will not be easily distracted. He is persistent in his goals and moves forward step by step. When others look up, they will find that He has reached unattainable heights. ”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“The biggest characteristic of Jingkun is rigor and professionalism,” Noah Tianze Insurance Brokerage Company has been a partner of Xu Jingkun and Xiao Shuyao since they started sailing around the world on a catamaran in 2017, and has been providing services to them until now. The racing team provides insurance services. Tianze Chairman Tian Feng pays close attention to the status of the racing boats. &quot;In the Coffee Road 1,200 nautical mile qualifying competition, they must pass through the storm stage according to regulations and chase the storm. The racing boats are intact, which fully proves that He does his job very carefully. For such a big boat, he has to personally maintain every detail to achieve such a state. This professionalism is responsible for himself, his sponsors, and his family. ”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Actually, I still occasionally have (emotional) outbursts at sea. &quot;When Rum Road crossed the Atlantic alone in 2022, he passed through three major storms in a row, with the maximum wind force exceeding 70 knots. &quot;The whole sea surface was howling like ghosts, which was very scary. &quot;Alone in the wind and waves, Xu Jingkun roared at the sea, &quot;Come on! How about it! &quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He laughed, &quot;No one has seen me like that, and I haven&#39;t told anyone before. Very dramatic, shouting and driving my boat into the wind and waves! ”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“I also did a very risky thing that time.” There were 8 sails on the IMOCA60 racing boat, each of which weighed more than 100 kilograms. When running down Rum Road, the strong wind blew Three sails were damaged. &quot;One sail fell directly into the sea, and the ship was still running. The more than 300 square meters of sail carried dozens of tons of seawater, and it was impossible to pull it up by human power. Xu Jingkun jumped into the cold Atlantic Ocean with a sharp blade, &quot;cut it bit by bit, cut it into pieces and brought it back.&quot; &quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The most taboo thing about deep-sea navigation is the separation of people and ships. In the depths of the ocean, even rescue forces are unable to reach it. &quot;After thinking about it afterwards, I still can&#39;t do this in the future. Xu Jingkun said that this kind of behavior was seriously inconsistent with his rational and steady nature, and he couldn&#39;t even explain it. &quot;But these are the thoughts of people on the shore under normal circumstances. In emergencies, your thoughts will be different.&quot; If I don&#39;t jump into the sea, the sail may sink the boat and the game will be terminated. I have paid so much for this game and I am absolutely not willing to give up like this. My boat is not just a boat, it is like my child and it is impossible not to save it. ”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to courageous adventure races, there are also many transmissions of love between people and ships and people in extreme sailing. In 2020, Vendée Globe staged the 61-year-old legendary sailor Jean. The story of Le Cam and several captains risking their lives to rescue Captain Kevin whose ship suffered a catastrophic breakage, Xu Jingkun, who rarely sheds tears, said, “These stories can easily touch my tears. ”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Captains know how to express love. Sailors who have helped each other in the most dangerous seas often participate in the Coffee Road Double Transatlantic Race. Xiao Shuyao posted on the “Xu Jingkun Global Sailing Team” public account In addition to publishing news about Xu Jingkun’s racing team, it also introduces many sailing heroes and maritime legends. She wrote this paragraph-&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“In 1997, the year before, I was in the Vendée Globe in an 80-knot storm. Pete Goss, who saved Rafael Dinelli from almost hypothermia, attended Dinelli&#39;s wedding as the best man, and the two teamed up to come to Café Road and won the CLASS2 category championship, becoming a leader in the offshore sailing industry. A beautiful talk. In 2012, 18 hours after the Vendée Jean Le Cam (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: italics, italics_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Yes, the one who rescued people in 2020&lt;/span>;) capsized , Vincent Riou came to save his life, and the two teamed up to win the IMOCA category championship on Café Road. It seems to have become a tradition for the combination of life and death in the Vendée to come to the Café Road to win the championship. &quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Ah Jiu knows how to sail! &quot;Although he always likes to jokingly call Xiao Shuyao &quot;unreliable Ah Jiu&quot;, he knows her preciousness in his heart.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xu Jingkun sincerely praised these maritime legends that transcended victory and defeat, &quot;I like to hear them very much. She told me these people and stories, but when I asked her, she couldn&#39;t stop, so I shouted stop, stop, I&#39;m going to work...&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Reporter from &quot;Southern People Weekly&quot; When I met Xu Jingkun in Qingdao at the end of September, it was less than a month before the coffee road started. “I was too tired some time ago and I have to adjust. There was basically nothing arranged when I came back this time. &quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We walked to the Olympic Sailing Center together. The autumn wind blew over, and he squinted his eyes, &quot;Awesome! This is the best season! Very comfortable! &quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;What happened to your left arm? ”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The janitor of the Qingdao Olympic Sailing Center had a tanned face. He may not have been in the city for long, and he still spoke with a local accent. Xu Jingkun and a group of people passed by him, and the eldest brother blurted out such a question. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“I had an accident when I was a kid. &quot;Xu Jingkun&#39;s tone and expression were very calm, and he stopped and looked at the eldest brother with a smile.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The janitor brother sat still, raised his face, his eyes were full of concern and love , continued to ask with the directness and enthusiasm of a villager, &quot;How is your life now? ”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“It’s okay, pretty good. ”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He pointed us to the place where his “Dream” once docked, “There, next to the red ship.” ”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 17 Oct 2023 15:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[患认知障碍的老人“被消费”60万：公检法对“坑老”现象应有力介入]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258702]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-17 14:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;According to a report by Shanghai&#39;s &quot;Xinmin Evening News&quot; on October 14, 2023, citizen Aunt Ren reported that her brother was suffering from She has severe cognitive impairment and is unable to communicate normally with others. She is still unmarried. Aunt Ren said that her brother lived with them every day and went out for more than 20 years. In 2016, a beauty shop in Beijing brought many aunts into the shop for free pedicures. They recommended massage items that &quot;can cure diseases&quot; and asked customers to spend money to apply for a card. , defrauding more than ten people of more than one million yuan. In the first instance, the Haidian Court sentenced beauty shop manager Zhao and store manager Feng to 10 years in prison for fraud, and sentenced three beauty technicians to fixed-term imprisonment ranging from 4 to 5 years in prison and fines. It can be seen that the beauty and hairdressing industry commits fraud against the elderly, especially the disabled elderly. Whether it is the staff who handle specific matters or business managers, those with serious cases must bear criminal liability for this. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The judiciary should give the law teeth and strengthen accountability for more similar cases, and also issue a warning to businesses in various industries: setting up various consumption traps for the elderly, and even using their physical or mental illness to induce To curb their consumption, the public security organs and the law should intervene effectively. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If you go one or two kilometers, your family will accompany you. In 2019, he went to the Wenfeng Wanping store in front of his home alone to get a haircut. So far, he has been &quot;consumed&quot; nearly 50 times at the Wenfeng Beauty Salon Wanping store and Tianyaoqiao store. His sisters have saved money for him over the years. All the nearly 600,000 yuan in medical expenses and pension funds accumulated were spent. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The so-called cognitive impairment, according to Jia Jianping, chief physician of Xuanwu Hospital of Capital Medical University, cognitive impairment is also called cognitive deficit. It is often divided into two categories: mild cognitive impairment and dementia. Patients can have personality traits at the same time. , mood changes, abnormal behaviors and other manifestations. A single elderly person with cognitive and communication impairments is a person with limited capacity for civil conduct. Article 22 of the Civil Code stipulates that adults who cannot fully identify their own behavior are persons with limited capacity for civil conduct. When performing civil legal acts, they shall be represented by their legal agent or with the consent or ratification of their legal agent. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Judging from the feedback from Aunt Ren and her brother, the store not only sent &quot;special personnel&quot; to follow them to the bank to withdraw cash or transfer money, but also &quot;helped&quot; the &quot;stupid uncle&quot; in their eyes to borrow money. Such behavior is obviously taking advantage of the elderly&#39;s cognitive impairment to deceive or force them to consume. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Aunt Ren also discovered that her brother not only spent nearly 600,000 yuan in the beauty shop, but also had recharge and electronic payment records that were inconsistent in time and amount. For tens of thousands of yuan, he only had handwritten recharge vouchers but no Abnormalities appeared in Wenfeng&#39;s payment records, the payee was shown as an out-of-town advertising company, and a single consumption of &quot;Wenfeng Body Care Golden Classic Essential Oil&quot; reached 10,000 yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If Aunt Ren’s statement is true, the Wenfeng beauty shop has been suspected of fraud. &quot;Provisions on the Standards for Filing and Prosecution of Criminal Cases under the Jurisdiction of Public Security Organs (II)&quot; stipulates that: in contract fraud cases for the purpose of illegal possession, during the process of signing and performing the contract, the other party&#39;s property is defrauded, and the amount is more than 20,000 yuan. File a case for prosecution. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Article 224 of the Criminal Law on the crime of contract fraud: Whoever defrauds public or private property, if the amount is relatively large, shall be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of not more than three years, criminal detention or surveillance, and shall also or solely be fined; If the amount is huge or there are other serious circumstances, he shall be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of not less than three years but not more than ten years, and shall also be fined; if the amount is particularly huge or there are other particularly serious circumstances, he shall be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of not less than ten years or life imprisonment, and shall also be fined or his property shall be confiscated. Article 1 of the Judicial Interpretation &quot;Interpretation on Several Issues Concerning the Specific Application of Laws in Handling Criminal Cases of Fraud&quot; stipulates: Those who defraud public or private property worth 3,000 yuan to more than 10,000 yuan, 30,000 yuan to more than 100,000 yuan, or more than 500,000 yuan, shall It should be determined as &quot;relatively large amount&quot;, &quot;huge amount&quot; and &quot;especially huge amount&quot; as stipulated in Article 266 of the Criminal Law. Comparing the criminal law and the relevant interpretations of the Supreme People&#39;s Court and the Supreme People&#39;s Procuratorate, Auntie Ren and her brother &quot;spent&quot; nearly 600,000 yuan at Wenfeng Beauty Shop, which is an &quot;extremely huge amount,&quot; and the judicial authorities should open a case for investigation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What happened to Aunt Ren and her brother is not an isolated case. As China gradually enters an aging society, the protection of the rights and interests of the elderly has attracted much attention from all walks of life. In 2016, the results of the fourth sample survey on the living conditions of the elderly in urban and rural areas in China jointly released by the National Office on Aging and the Ministry of Civil Affairs showed that there were approximately 40.63 million disabled or semi-disabled elderly people in my country, accounting for 18.3% of the elderly population. Among them, the proportion of elderly people with dementia is also not low. Disabled or semi-disabled elderly people often lose all or part of their ability to take care of themselves, and their spouses and children, who are guardians, are unable to be with them at all times due to various reasons, which makes it easy for some criminals to take advantage of them. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Old people and old people&quot; are social ethics, but some people regard the elderly as lambs to be slaughtered. In recent years, illegal cases targeting the elderly have been repeatedly exposed. In April 2022, the Ping An China Construction Coordination Group took the lead in deploying a nationwide special operation to crack down on pension fraud. In June, the Supreme People&#39;s Procuratorate announced 6 typical cases to crack down on pension fraud crimes. The 6 typical cases covered various types of pensions such as investing in the pension industry, booking pension apartments, selling collectibles, providing diagnosis and treatment services for the elderly, and handling &quot;pension pensions&quot;. Typical fraud methods involve crimes related to fund-raising fraud, illegal absorption of public deposits, fraud, infringement of citizens’ personal information and other crimes related to pension fraud. The deeper the schemes that harm the elderly, the more accountability the law should have. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 17 Oct 2023 14:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[公费定向师范生违约屡见不鲜，多集中于工作后]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258728]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-17 13:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;A few days ago, the Education Bureau of Lufeng City, Guangdong Province issued the &quot;Guangdong Province Publicly Funded Targeted Training of Primary and Secondary Schools in Eastern Guangdong, Western Guangdong and Northern Guangdong&quot; Teacher (directed to Shanwei Lufeng) List of defaulters&quot; has attracted social attention.

If students&#39; personal sense of gain can be increased from policy and other levels, a win-win situation between public and personal interests can actually be achieved.

Some students also hope to further their studies. And breach of contract. For working graduates, the main problem is that their development demands are not met. Since they have accumulated enough experience and capital, graduates hope to move to better jobs and have enough financial foundation to pay liquidated damages and default. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, some public-funded normal school students who are already working are unable to adapt to the actual local work conditions, culture and atmosphere, and leave their posts before reaching the contracted working period. According to investigations, some local competent authorities failed to scientifically predict, rationally plan, and make timely adjustments when formulating the needs of public-funded directional training plans, which led to problems in job matching for public-funded oriented normal school students after graduation, and the phenomenon of &quot;sending teachers wherever there is a shortage.&quot; &quot;Go&quot; and other situations where &quot;teaching profession and job position do not match or do not match&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Generally speaking, most defaults occur after graduation, and it is more common to default after working for several years.&quot; Xie Ailei said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As the head teacher of the orientation class, Xie Ailei also observed that not all students knew the actual situation of the project when they first enrolled. &quot;Including the students I teach, some of them were chosen with the help of their parents. They don&#39;t know much about the position of orientation teachers and their future work conditions.&quot; He told Nandu reporters: &quot;I have noticed some trends. Students who have just entered school are At that time, many people paid more attention to the cost and responsibility of breach of contract, but did not fully understand the place where they would work in the future. By the time they are in their sophomore year, students began to be anxious, thinking about what to do when they go back to work, whether there are other options after graduation, etc. In their junior year, students think about what to do if they don’t adapt when they go back, what will happen after six years of orientation, etc.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From a sociological perspective, one of the major reasons for breach of contract is that students In the early stage, the reality was not recognized when making choices, and in the later stage, career identity was not fully developed. From the perspective of educational economics, breach of contract actually reflects the conflict between personal interests and public interests, and students cannot be blamed blindly; if it can increase students&#39; personal sense of gain, it can also achieve a win-win situation for public and personal interests. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To this end, Xie Ailei has carried out targeted intervention since the beginning of freshmen&#39;s enrollment. Through regular one-on-one communication, class meetings and other forms, he has popularized the rights and obligations of publicly funded normal school students and the connotation of teachers&#39; work. , future workplace environment, etc., and lead students to conduct surveys of schools in counties in eastern Guangdong, western Guangdong, and northern Guangdong, in order to enhance students&#39; sense of career and job identity. &quot;It has been observed that students who default after graduation mainly leave their jobs, but rarely leave the teaching profession. If schools and teachers can consciously intervene, students&#39; professional identity, career identity, and job identity will have better results.&quot;&lt;/ p>; &lt;h4>;Recommendation: Implement &quot;post-incentive&quot; measures on the basis of &quot;pre-compensation&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Although there is a restriction mechanism at the policy level for defaults. But in Xie Ailei&#39;s view, punishment can only be said to be a cover-up, but it cannot fundamentally solve the problem. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He suggested that students need to think more fully about their career plans and understand the work content and actual working conditions of rural teachers before entering publicly funded targeted projects. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For training institutions, it is necessary to focus on grasping the key time points in the early stage of volunteer application and increase publicity. After students enroll, colleges and universities must also start from a management perspective. While allowing students to fully master professional skills, they must continue to pay attention to and guide students&#39; career and job identity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For local education departments, it is necessary to combine the actual situation of teacher education reform and development, scientifically predict the supplementary demand for teachers in shortage subjects in the basic education field in the region, and reasonably prepare annual public-funded targeted training plans. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, relevant government departments should also carry out more &quot;post-incentive&quot; measures on the basis of &quot;pre-compensation&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, government departments can implement a classified and hierarchical reward mechanism based on the remoteness of the school, environmental conditions, etc. &quot;One of my students did a survey using data from middle school teachers in counties in eastern Guangdong, western Guangdong and northern Guangdong. It was found that the farther the school is from the economically developed areas of the Pearl River Delta, the more teachers want to move. If we look at this situation, is there a difference? A personalized reward mechanism.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, rewards will be provided based on the number of years of performance, and more opportunities and preferential treatment policies will be given in terms of professional development and promotion channels to enhance the work motivation of public-funded normal school students. The &quot;Implementation Measures&quot; propose that targets of public-funded targeted training are encouraged to improve their academic qualifications through self-study examinations, correspondence courses, and on-the-job postgraduate studies. Xie Ailei also mentioned that high-level normal universities can be jointly established to establish targeted teacher training collaborative training centers to provide qualified graduates with high-level master&#39;s degrees in education and solve their worries in terms of institutional mechanisms. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Whether students can obtain high-quality mobility after they have completed their obligations is also one of the methods worth considering.&quot; Xie Ailei said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 17 Oct 2023 13:25:02 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
