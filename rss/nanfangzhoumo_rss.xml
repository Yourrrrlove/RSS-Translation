Hangzhou’s business cards include the Qiantang River, the Grand Canal, West Lake and Xixi Wetland are closely related to water. Therefore, in terms of creative concept, the opening ceremony uses water as the core element throughout the entire venue. The overall theme of the opening ceremony is &quot;Tide Asia&quot;, which means that China in the new era is integrating with Asia and the world, rushing forward like a wave. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/23/97ae74e566e74fa893a8f8ace87d3203.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;427&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/23/97ae74e566e74fa893a8f8ace87d3203.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;251745&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span>;The Qiantang River flows through Hangzhou. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The opening ceremony will be divided into three chapters. Through the presentation of &quot;National Style and Elegance&quot;, &quot;Qiantang Tide&quot; and &quot;Hand in Hand&quot;, it will show the national style and national trend, the trend of nature and the trend of science and technology. , the collision of the tide of sports and the tide of the times. The embodiment of the &quot;water&quot; element is not only the source of the Liangzhu culture of Chinese civilization, but also the traceability of Zhejiang culture and Hangzhou culture. It is also the connection between the mountains and rivers of Asian countries and expresses the wish for a better China in the future. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Technology and art go in both directions&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In the three major chapters, Hangzhou has more than 5,000 years of civilization history, a thousand years of Song Dynasty culture and the characteristics of the digital city Integrated display. The Liangzhu culture, which has a history of more than 5,000 years, allows the audience to appreciate the power of the light of civilization to illuminate the progress of history; the cultural spirit of the Southern Song Dynasty and modern civilized and intelligent Hangzhou are connected through a Gongchen Bridge, forming an ancient and modern world. Cultural dialogue and time travel; through 3D Dual Wire technology, the majestic Qiantang River tide will be presented to the audience in a new way...&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At that time, through the cooperation of ground screen, three-dimensional perspective screen, and naked-eye 3D The design of the visual effects and virtual images directly &quot;moves&quot; the thousands of miles of rivers and mountains, the mist and rain in the south of the Yangtze River, the tide of the Qiantang River, and the green waters and green mountains on the stage, creating a scene where people are walking in the painting and swimming in the painting. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/23/3f2db9212a4b5ea0998548e36ac08a8f.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;427&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/23/3f2db9212a4b5ea0998548e36ac08a8f.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;251750&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span>;Hangzhou Olympic Sports Center stadium complex. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the last moment, you can see the scene of ancient Lin&#39;an and modern Hangzhou facing each other. The director team used virtual technology to present to the public a scene of thousands of lights of ancient and modern cities. . “We know each other no matter how far away we are, but we are still neighbors thousands of miles away.” Hangzhou will extend the most sincere invitation to all of Asia. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Electronic fireworks are expected to be full&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In order to reflect the green, smart, frugal and civilized hosting concept of this Asian Games, no physical fireworks will be set off during the opening ceremony. fireworks. Although there is no grand fireworks display, the excitement of the opening ceremony will not be greatly reduced. The creative team innovates and uses the power of technology, 3D animation, AR technology, etc. to display fireworks in front of TV audiences and live audiences. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/23/522cc071258c7f54ec6dba0b4830ef76.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;427&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/23/522cc071258c7f54ec6dba0b4830ef76.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;251749&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span>;Hangzhou Olympic Sports Center Tennis Center. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fireworks made with virtual technology are even more brilliant and beautiful than real fireworks. To this end, Sha Xiaolan, chief director and chief producer of the opening ceremony of the Hangzhou Asian Games, also gave a viewing guide: everyone can watch the opening ceremony electronic fireworks show through TV, mobile phones and other ports, and the overall viewing effect is better than on-site. The creative team will use digital technology to present a 360-degree panoramic view of the electronic fireworks performances on both sides of the Qianjiang River, the Hangzhou Olympic Sports Center venue complex, and the &quot;Big Lotus&quot; from angles such as upward, downward, and side views. This will be a highlight of the opening ceremony. time. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;The suspense of the lighting ceremony will be revealed&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;As a traditional ceremony of modern large-scale sports events, the lighting ceremony conveys the spirit and concept of the games. The lighting ceremony of the Hangzhou Asian Games adheres to the concept of &quot;green, smart, frugal and civilized&quot; and follows the requirements of &quot;simple, safe and exciting&quot;. It is environmentally friendly without losing creativity and is full of technology. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This Hangzhou Asian Games launched the Asian Games Digital Torch, pioneering the concept of &quot;Asian Games Digital Torchbearers&quot; and inviting netizens around the world to compete to be the Asian Games Digital Torchbearers and participate in online torch relay activities, so that the Asian Games flames can Delivery breaks through the limitations of time and space. At the opening ceremony on the evening of the 23rd, the creative team will complete the lighting of the main torch in the form of &quot;digital and real integration&quot;, creating the first digital ignition ceremony in the history of the Asian Games. Judging from current real-time statistics, more than 100 million digital torchbearers will participate. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/23/edb657b938fa64cb2f741b5ba6f49727.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;427&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/23/edb657b938fa64cb2f741b5ba6f49727.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;251746&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span>;Hangzhou Asian Games fire collection ceremony. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the evening of the 23rd, each online and offline torchbearer was a small flame and a shining point, gathering on the Qiantang River to form a concrete &quot;digital person&quot; walking on the Qiantang River. The tide surged and the steps were determined, rushing to the sky above the &quot;Big Lotus&quot;, breaking the barriers of time and space, leaping into the 185-meter three-dimensional screen, meeting the sixth torchbearer, &quot;digital and real fusion&quot; lighting the main torch tower, completing the lighting ceremony.

I am from Beijing but I don’t have a house because I used the money that could have been used to buy a house to study abroad. I thought my room for appreciation was higher than that in Beijing. House prices are high.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“My major in the United States was economics. I used the money to buy a house to study economics, which is equivalent to spending a lot of money. I learned that I shouldn’t spend this money. ”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Jiu Gu put her own experience into a short video, with four big words “Losing Privileges” in white letters on a red background, which became the most popular content on Jiu Gu’s video account. She intentionally made this short video The video adds elements that bring traffic, &quot;privilege&quot;, which points to the imbalance of regional development and the gap between rich and poor; &quot;cannot afford a house&quot;, which resonates with the general anxiety caused by housing prices; &quot;study abroad&quot;, which is related to education involution and the aura of prestigious schools. . She also hugged cats and dogs in the video, and said this frankly: &quot;It&#39;s also for traffic. ”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Jiu Gu’s narration, she played her “good cards” to pieces, but in fact, she did not feel that her choice was wrong. She believed that everything she did was in the direction of the country. She is moving towards a goal - to become a world superstar. This goal was set early, starting from the age of 4, without any feasibility assessment, all relying on self-confidence.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She changed her online name to &quot;Jiu Gu Yao&quot; &quot;Fire&quot;, making no secret of his ambitions and desires.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So, can a person who just wants to tell the truth, appear in photos without makeup, and has a moderate view really become popular on the current Internet?&lt; /p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/0eq17pfRpfExYoj6yLeFzpCsLV51ZCoWo5kh4tXw.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot; 720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/0eq17pfRpfExYoj6yLeFzpCsLV51ZCoWo5kh4tXw.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251343&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Jiu Gu travels around the United States&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(provided by the respondent/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Average &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Finding that it was difficult for her to buy a house in Beijing as a Beijinger, Jiu Gu realized that she had missed the advantages of being a local. At that time, she returned from studying abroad and did not want to live with her parents all the time. , renting an apartment in Beijing, and encountered a second landlord who ran away with money, and her job was not going well, she fell into a low point in life.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Why did she choose to study abroad? Jiu Gu believes that the main reason is that she was isolated in school. From elementary school to high school, Jiu Gu attended one of the top five public schools in Beijing. As grades went up, grades became more and more important. By high school, Jiu Gu felt that everyone cared about grades, and only top academics would be punished. Respect, people like her who like to participate in club activities are &quot;deviants&quot; who are not doing their job properly.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The conflict broke out at a chorus festival. Jiu Gu was responsible for organizing rehearsals, but her classmates thought that rehearsals took up study time, and they were against The rejection of the chorus focused on Jiu Gu personally, and the cold violence spread throughout the class like a virus. Jiu Gu felt that she was not wrong. The liberal arts experimental class in the school often had the opportunity to rehearse dramas and participate in cultural and sports activities, while the students in the ordinary class could only As an audience, she just wants to participate once.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Jiu Gu has liked to do activities since she was a child, which is called Zanju in Beijing dialect. For example, she holds a Spring Festival Gala at home and lets her family put on a show. She wants to study abroad. In the early years, many literary and art planners in Beijing had overseas study backgrounds in order to have access to more cultural resources. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It was around 2010. The family was originally planning to use their savings to buy a house. Because of Jiu Gu’s sudden decision, the money was instead used for her study abroad expenses. &quot;At that time, I felt that buying a house was meaningless. Why trap myself in a space? There is a vast world outside, and there is a lot to do.&quot; In her imagination, after returning from studying abroad, she would live a glamorous and dreamy life, save games every day, and attend meetings. Activity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Jiu Gu failed to study her favorite musical because her mother thought she would not be able to find a job after graduation, so she chose economics and was admitted to the University of California, Davis. She chose economics because she was interested in marketing. She wanted to know why people decide to buy something. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Later she discovered that economics was not what she studied, and it was equally difficult to find a job after graduation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Looking back on her educational experience, despite having excellent educational resources, Jiu Gu felt that she had made many detours. Some people did not have many resources when they were young, but they knew clearly what they wanted to do and started from scratch. For example, Qiao Xiaodao, &quot;was a welder, held art exhibitions in Beijing, became a folk singer, and now does installation art in Dali. He is self-taught by reading books.&quot; , always moving in your own direction, unlike us, who have to go to school, take exams, learn more things for exams, and suppress what you really want to learn. Being born in Beijing is my privilege, but this environment It’s just dragging me toward the average.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After graduating and returning to China, Jiu Gu participated in a teaching aid company that provides innovative education, designing project-based learning courses to inspire students’ creativity. She didn&#39;t do it for long because she found that domestic innovation education was biased toward &quot;extremes.&quot; &quot;One type is the privilege of the rich. Even if they fail, they still have the resources to send their children to a good system; the other type is schools that provide re-education for low-income dropouts or migrant children. People in the middle are following the big trend. Stream.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/jTMHHDwvhx13OLfolt3PXAd4y77UrZI3vvdkMurM.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960 &quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/jTMHHDwvhx13OLfolt3PXAd4y77UrZI3vvdkMurM.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251345&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style =&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In order to shoot a short video, Jiu Gu put makeup into a heart&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(provided by interviewee/picture)&lt;/ span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Outside the mainstream&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;When she was studying in college in the United States, Jiu Gu switched from economics to psychology, and took advantage of elective courses to learn a lot of linguistics and music that she was interested in. courses. Besides studying, Jiu Gu found something more interesting - living in a hippie community. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the 1970s, the University of California, Davis, launched a community housing experiment and built a unique dormitory area in order to explore sustainable lifestyles. When Jiu Gu saw those small white hemispherical houses for the first time, she thought they were cool. There were gardens, vegetable fields, and chicken sheds between the houses. She then applied to move in and lived there for a total of three years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The community is jointly shaped by the residents. There is a community meeting every week to collectively discuss public decisions and follow the consensus principle, &quot;Everyone agrees to do something before that thing can be done.&quot; Everyone gathers for dinner every weekday evening in the felt room in the community center and takes turns cooking. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When faced with strong cultural differences at first, Jiu Gu felt alienated. She used a long and slow process to adapt and hoped to maintain a more equal cultural interaction. She would initiate Chinese culture in the community The activity uses original poetry recitation (slam poetry) and talk show to introduce &quot;who am I&quot; and &quot;what is China&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Most of the first generation residents of the community were young people who participated in the hippie movement. When Jiu Gu moved in, the community still retained the critical spirit of sovereign culture and resisted sexism, racial discrimination, etc. &quot;It was different. What&#39;s more, it&#39;s not so confrontational, not so radical, and more sustained.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After returning to China, Jiu Gu maintained her concern for public affairs and equal rights issues. After seeing a video of one person laughing causing the whole carriage to laugh, she initiated an action to spread laughter on the subway. After experiencing it, her feeling was, &quot;Don&#39;t suppress it when you want to laugh, laugh generously.&quot; Come out, I believe someone will respond.&quot; Feeling that there were few female rock singers, she interviewed women in &quot;atypical&quot; occupations to explore the gender barriers erected by their professions. She also joined a feminist group, participated in the creation and performance of the group&#39;s original play &quot;The Way of the Vagina&quot; based on Eva Ensler&#39;s &quot;The Vagina Monologues&quot;, and created rap songs related to women&#39;s rights. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But Jiu Gu’s career is not going well. She likes more creative jobs and is looking for entrepreneurial companies, such as making maker education and developing social communities for young people. The failure rate is very high. &quot;These companies themselves are not very profitable, and they are all going downhill in the end.&quot; In more than four years, she changed six or seven jobs. After she became unemployed again in 2019, she did not find a job for most of the year, whether it was an entrepreneurial company. She was not hired by any of the major Internet companies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The most direct job in front of her is that of an overseas study agency, with a commission of tens of thousands per order. However, Jiu Gu cannot agree with this job from her heart and feels it is meaningless. &quot;It belongs to a rich man.&quot; The shortcut is that as long as you have money, you can find someone to help you write materials and package yourself.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Furthermore, &quot;it is difficult to prove that studying abroad has a future&quot; when you return from studying abroad and work as a study abroad agency. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the beginning of 2020, Jiu Gu found a job in Shanghai. Her mother said that she was a traitor in Beijing. &quot;There are so many jobs in Beijing, can&#39;t you find any one?&quot; Jiu Gu changed this sentence into a joke. , &quot;The capital city cannot accommodate you.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This job did not last long, and she was fired again two months later. She stopped looking for a job, opened her own marketing studio, and created a personal account to showcase her creativity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to increase her popularity, she decided to become an internet celebrity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/O05PXWYwVL73B42xg3PqMdxE8guoB35VPgt4PLOR.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/O05PXWYwVL73B42xg3PqMdxE8guoB35VPgt4PLOR.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251342&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Jiu Gu’s offline talk show stage&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(provided by interviewee/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4 >;Keep it real&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;When she first started writing articles and making videos, Jiu Gu found it difficult to attract traffic. One video only had dozens of views. She turned to talk shows in Shanghai and accumulated offline popularity. She had been giving English talk shows before, and the jokes she came up with were more in line with the English sense of language and humor. It took a lot of effort for her to re-cultivate the Chinese sense of language. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One time, Jiu Gu failed at an offline open mic talk. When she got off the stage, she met Li Dan and asked him how to overcome the language difficulty. Li Dan suggested that she listen more to Guo Degang, so she watched Deyunshe&#39;s variety show to practice her accent, sense of language, learn talk show techniques, and study text structure. Her talk show business performance went from being watched by only 8 people to 30, 60, and 700 people, and her income began to exceed her job. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She writes her unemployment, failure to be single, and failure by all worldly standards into talk show jokes, and uses self-dissolution to arouse the audience&#39;s resonance with negative emotions. But she claimed that she has never regretted the past. As she said in the video, &quot;When I say these failed experiences, it does not mean that I am not confident. It is precisely because of my confidence that I dare to use these failed experiences as material.&quot; .&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2022, as a talk show actor, Jiu Gu participated in the filming of an offline blind date documentary. Perhaps to increase the sense of conflict, the program team arranged a 61-year-old male blind date for 28-year-old Jiu Gu, Lao Wu, one year older than her father. After the show was aired, Jiu Gu&#39;s clip caused a lot of controversy and discussion. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When greeting her, Lao Wu pretended to be humorous and said, &quot;Long time no see.&quot; and asked her, &quot;Do you think the Huangpu River is beautiful today?&quot; Jiu Gu replied directly, &quot;I can&#39;t see the river here.&quot;&lt;/p >; &lt;p>;Lao Wu put on a preachy attitude, &quot;Do you think women should be independent?&quot; Jiu Gu asked, &quot;What is independence?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lao Wu quoted from classics, &quot;Have you seen Simon... Beauvoir&#39;s &quot;The Second Sex&quot;? They are experimenting with how to turn women from the second sex into women as the first sex.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Jiu Gu did not accept the move, &quot;I don&#39;t think Beauvoir She knows better than me on the topic of women’s rights, and I don’t think I know better than her.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The performance in the show made Jiu Gu a little popular, and she began to insist on updating videos every day. Take advantage of the opportunity to make a popular account. The topic of women&#39;s rights discussed during the blind date became her first traffic point. Jiu Gu does not talk about theory or academics. A publishing house sent her feminist books. When making a short video, she bluntly said that she did not read it. “I personally extracted my understanding of women’s rights from my life experience.” I don’t think these so-called authorities with a higher social status than me understand my demands for women’s rights better than I do.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although Jiu Gu believes that she advocates gender equality, and even wrote “Equality between men and women” &quot;You can do whatever you want, you can be a charmer, you can be a charmer, you can be a charmer.&quot; However, her views on gender rights continue to attract controversy. Some netizens accused her of being a &quot;feminist&quot;, while others called her a &quot;charmer&quot;. male&quot;. From time to time, Jiu Gu will &quot;retaliate&quot; to these comments. She found that &quot;gender opposition&quot; is indeed a traffic password. If there is opposition, there will be controversy, the number of controversial comments will be high, and it will be easy to be recommended by the algorithm. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When she used &quot;equal rights&quot;, she was deemed by the video platform to be &quot;not in line with community norms.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What attracts the most traffic is chasing hot spots. “Platform push traffic is directly related to hot spots. As long as it is a hot spot, it doesn’t matter how bad you say it is. There is a qualitative difference between having a hot spot and not having a hot spot. The traffic is at least The difference is 10 times.&quot; In September 2023, the hot spots that Jiu Gu chased include &quot;Xiucai&#39;s live broadcast room was blocked&quot;, &quot;Moutai Coffee&quot;, &quot;Li Jiaqi&#39;s live broadcast room overturned&quot;, etc. Although she chased hot spots, she said that not saying a word would go against her inner will. if. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for the middle-aged and elderly aunts who reward talented people, Jiu Gu said, &quot;We women have worked hard for half our lives, so we should spend money to make ourselves happy.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Pulling others is also a kind of diversion. The way is, &quot;You can let their fans scold you and increase my popularity.&quot; For example, Jiu Gula once stepped on another Internet celebrity Ququ, &quot;She is still not as good as me because she teaches you to please others, but I teach you to be self-consistent... …Although I am single, have no money, and have bad skin, I am very self-contained. I can say whatever I want, and I can still be popular.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Faced with the accusations of trying to attract traffic and trolling, Jiu Gu is very Frank said, &quot;Yes, that&#39;s a marketing tool. It&#39;s what a marketer must do, and I&#39;m doing it openly.&quot; There were four big words written on the cover of the video where La Tia Qu Qu was involved - - &quot;Pull and step on each other&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Keep it real, I find everyone is too unreal.&quot; Jiu Gu said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/3van6XHDJ2rAF6FAJ3i56jKkLcrL9GsFYAI2T7v0.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;460&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/3van6XHDJ2rAF6FAJ3i56jKkLcrL9GsFYAI2T7v0.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251349&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Offline blind date documentary &quot;I want to ask you if you dare&quot;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(provided by interviewee/picture)&lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Become a world star&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;One of the biggest features of Jiu Gu’s videos is that she appears without makeup and without filters. Her reason is also very real, &quot;I change my makeup every day. It&#39;s so tiring to put on makeup for 30 minutes every day, and I can&#39;t put it on well.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the bottom of almost every video, there are comments about her appearance. &quot;Wear something on, I can&#39;t stand it anymore.&quot; There are almost no female Internet celebrities who don&#39;t wear makeup. This has shaped the aesthetic and polite standards of the Internet. Some netizens will criticize even if they don&#39;t judge from the perspective of beauty and ugliness. Jiu Gu is disrespectful to others. “In public places, putting on makeup and tidying up is a sign of respect for yourself and others.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Jiu Gu firmly believed that this was not her problem, so she responded with a short video, &quot;If you think I don&#39;t respect you by not wearing makeup, then you don&#39;t deserve to be respected at all. If you don&#39;t like others and still have to say it, then there is something wrong with your eyes. People who like to comment on other people&#39;s appearance are not well-educated. At the end of the video, she used self-mockery to dispel the serious atmosphere, &quot;Unlike me, she is super beautiful without makeup. It is better not to wear makeup after putting it on.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The comment area may still be considered words. In a gentle place, online violence in private messages is rampant. Jiu Gu has received countless insults with swear words and dirty jokes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Judging from their names, avatars, and account content, it’s hard to imagine that they would be so rude to others. Someone called “Wen Wen Zhi Advance and Retreat” said, “How dare your parents treat you like this?” Give birth.&quot; Someone whose profile picture was in a bachelor&#39;s uniform repeatedly called her &quot;ugly.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Jiu Gu’s self-confidence prevented her from feeling hurt, but she didn’t want to be silent either. She posted several videos, advocating using “cyber hugs” to resist “cyber violence”, “I can’t control what other people say about me. Malice, I can also choose not to be affected by them, but actively spread kindness and push the world to be what I want.&quot; After a video about feminism caused a quarrel about &quot;gender opposition&quot; in the comment area, for Instead of creating confrontation, she replaced &quot;feminist rights&quot; with &quot;equal rights&quot;. Because she wanted to be a &quot;problem solver&quot;, she compiled a collection of videos called &quot;Resolving the Contradiction between Men and Women&quot; to explain prejudices about gender and rights. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Jiu Gu&#39;s popularity on the Internet has brought many orders to her marketing studio, and also added a lot of fun to her life. &quot;I&#39;m very monotonous in reality. I don&#39;t have an office or colleagues. If I don&#39;t go online, I rarely chat with people. I just go to a friend&#39;s shop.&quot; Even though I receive a lot of negative comments online, in reality Here, all interactions between people were suppressed in silence. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Jiu Gu feels that she is very popular now. Four or five people recognize her on the street every day, and the traffic data of each video is good. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But that’s not enough. Her goal is to become a world star. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;What happens after becoming a superstar?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Influence the world, do valuable things, eliminate poverty, promote environmental protection, and empower women.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p >;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 23 Sep 2023 18:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[运动员如何开启亚运生活？南周记者带你探营运动员村]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257474]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-23 17:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 23 Sep 2023 17:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[一起冲“亚” | 杭州亚运会专题报道]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257329]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-23 16:29:12&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;The 19th Asian Games in Hangzhou opens today (September 23), and the world’s attention is once again focused on China.

In March 2022, the Cyberspace Administration of China issued the &quot;Regulations on the Internet Protection of Minors (Draft for Comments)&quot;, which set forth requirements for the responsibilities of parents, schools and platforms. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A year and a half later, the bill was passed. Sun Hongyan, director of the Children&#39;s Research Institute of the China Youth Research Center, analyzed to Southern Weekend reporters that there are currently 191 million minor Internet users, and the rate of minors accessing the Internet has reached 96.8%, showing the characteristics of large groups and younger age, and the introduction of special Regulations on the protection of minors on the Internet are inevitable. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Why is the time span as long as 7 years? &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;From the release of the &quot;Regulations on the Internet Protection of Minors (Draft for Comments)&quot; in September 2016 to the release of the &quot;Regulations on the Internet Protection of Minors (Draft for Comments)&quot; in March 2022 》, which spans five and a half years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;21st Century Business Herald&quot; quoted Yao Zhiwei, a professor at the School of Law of Guangdong University of Finance and Economics, as saying that one of the main reasons why the two releases were so long apart is that the higher-level legal minors protection law did not exist at the time. It is of little practical significance to revise and separately formulate and issue regulations on the online protection of minors. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In October 2020, the Law on the Protection of Minors was revised for the second time, adding new provisions related to online protection. This change is of great significance to the introduction of regulations on the protection of minors. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sun Hongyan believes that the newly revised Law on the Protection of Minors has added a special chapter on Internet protection, which is nearly 10,000 words long, and a large part of it is about Internet protection. This makes the Regulations on the Internet Protection of Minors The newly revised Law on the Protection of Minors can be used to provide more detailed provisions on network protection. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In August 2021, the 30th meeting of the Standing Committee of the 13th National People&#39;s Congress voted to pass the Personal Information Protection Law. The law added a special chapter on network protection to protect minors. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On August 30, 2021, the State Press and Publication Administration issued the &quot;Notice on Further Strict Management to Effectively Prevent Minors from Addicting to Online Games&quot;, which aims to strictly implement the real-name system and limit game duration. Solve the problem of online game addiction among minors. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for the seven years it took before and after, Sun Hongyan analyzed, “During this period, experts from different disciplines and fields also conducted multiple rounds of discussions, revisions, and improvements. Regulations cannot just be a call-to-action, so specific requirements are particularly needed. , operable regulations as action guidelines.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2023, the process of legalization of minors&#39; online protection is accelerating. In May 2023, the State Council&#39;s 2023 legislative work plan mentioned the &quot;Regulations on the Internet Protection of Minors&quot;, which was among the 17 draft administrative regulations to be reviewed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Two months later, in July 2023, the Ministry of Justice and the Cyberspace Administration of China conducted a special study and review of the &quot;Regulations on the Internet Protection of Minors (Draft)&quot; to accelerate the legislative process of the regulations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On September 20, 2023, when the State Council executive meeting reviewed and approved the &quot;Regulations on the Internet Protection of Minors (Draft)&quot;, it was pointed out that it is necessary to build a solid legal support for the Internet protection of minors. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;How to classify user age more scientifically? &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The 2016 draft had a total of 36 items. By 2022, the draft has been expanded to 67 items. The main content is divided into 4 parts: strengthening the cultivation of network literacy among minors, Strengthen the regulation of online information content, strengthen the protection of minors&#39; personal information, and strengthen the prevention and treatment of minors&#39; Internet addiction. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&amp;nbsp;Sun Hongyan analyzed that the draft regulations passed this time will have two obvious characteristics: detailed provisions and specific provisions on many problems that minors may encounter on the Internet; and operable The responsibilities of parents, schools, platforms and other entities have been stipulated in detail, so that &quot;three monks will not be left without water to drink.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zheng Ning, director of the Law Department of the School of Cultural Industry Management of Communication University of China, also analyzed the Southern Weekend reporter. Judging from the previous draft for comments, this draft focuses on the improvement of Internet literacy and Internet minors. Issues such as personal information protection, network anti-addiction, etc. In addition, the &quot;youth mode&quot; on smart terminal products has been upgraded to &quot;underage mode&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sun Hongyan also noticed that although multi-level government departments have relevant requirements, the applicable age threshold for &quot;youth mode&quot; set by many social apps is in name only. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Her conclusion is that guardians do not have a strong awareness of protecting minors and do not even know how to set up a youth mode. They always want to put all responsibilities on the major platforms, but the platforms lack good content. pool, resulting in &quot;teen mode&quot; failing to attract teenagers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zheng Ning emphasized that the draft regulations passed this time “have also systematically organized and stipulated the obligations and responsibilities of Internet companies in the protection of minors, especially requiring them to carry out corresponding social Responsibility Assessment”. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zheng Ning further explained that at present, companies have insufficient motivation to invest in the protection of minors. Only when there is a relatively sufficient supply of content can they divide users by age and provide different content to users of different age groups. &quot;The protection of minors is actually more about fulfilling social responsibilities for companies, which requires a lot of costs. Many companies lack motivation. Objectively speaking, some companies do not have the ability to purchase large amounts of copyrighted content. ”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 23 Sep 2023 15:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[新情景喜剧《鹊刀门传奇》]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257440]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-23 14:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/20/qBDTFnpRo1XELhYjuM1A5VRL7zpx5B9x1lsrUzsa.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/ qBDTFnp Ro1 a series of stories. After 40 episodes, the Douban score was 8.1, and the audience regained the familiar taste of domestic sitcoms. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The development of sitcoms in my country can be summarized into several stages. In the early 1990s, works such as &quot;The Story of the Editorial Office&quot; and &quot;I Love My Family&quot; appeared, winning the ratings at the time and marking the beginning of China&#39;s local indoor sitcoms. The scenes in this form are relatively simple and fixed. The stories and jokes usually unfold between several characters. The language is vivid and rich in philosophy. It was loved by the audience at that time. In the ten years from 2000 to 2009, sitcoms developed rapidly. Well-known works such as &quot;Story of the Cooking Class&quot;, &quot;Wulin Gaiden&quot; and &quot;A Daughter in the Family&quot; are still watched and discussed repeatedly by the audience. They have broad influence and a significant long-tail effect. However, after 2010, there are few similar classic sitcoms on the market, and related creations seem to have entered a period of stagnation. The reasons are, first of all, because the development of the Internet and short videos has profoundly changed the way the public watches, making it easier for the audience to get jokes; secondly, sitcoms are limited to &quot;family-friendly&quot; content and are difficult to expand in other fields. It is also an important reason for his loneliness. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The appearance of &quot;The Legend of Magpie Sword&quot; (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;hereinafter referred to as &quot;Magpie Sword&quot; &lt;/span>;) breaks the tradition The sitcom has a single indoor scene, but the scenes in the play are diverse, both indoors and outdoors, and martial arts elements are integrated into it. The high-quality fight scenes and a lot of baggage and plots that follow current events make the audience feel fresh and new. In addition, Zhao Benshan The performance of the comedian doubled the comedy effect. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Aidou Media Screenwriting Studio stated that it has always wanted to create dramas with a strong sense of contrast. The planners and screenwriters in the team are very fond of Jin Yong&#39;s martial arts works. Everyone generally believes that in recent years, there have been no traditional martial arts works that meet the standards they want. And because the team has a high &quot;content&quot; of Northeasterners, everyone joked that they would create &quot;Northeastern literature and art&quot; &quot;Revival&quot;, therefore, the idea of ​​&quot;a martial arts comedy starring Zhao Benshan and taking place in the Northeast&quot; was born. This was the initial idea of ​​&quot;Magpie Sword Gate&quot;. In addition, one of the directors, Wu Di, is a world martial arts champion. He once participated in Tsui Hark&#39;s &quot;Flying Swords of Dragon Gate&quot; and has his own opinions on martial arts and martial arts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the beginning of &quot;Magpie Sword Sect&quot;, Zhao Benshan plays a pair of twin brothers, one is Ximen Changhai, the head of the Magpie Sword Sect who is highly skilled in martial arts, and the other is the timid cook Ximen Changzai. He had to go out for important matters, so in order to stabilize the hearts of both people inside and outside, he asked Chang Zai to be his substitute, which led to a ridiculous storyline that followed. This &quot;dual identity&quot; setting is the basis for the dramatic and comedic effects of the opening chapter. But in fact, this setting was not included in the original script, because Zhao Benshan was confused about &quot;how to play a hero well.&quot; The screenwriting team thought about how to make Zhao Benshan feel like a &quot;hero&quot; and make this character more interesting. level, so I thought, let &quot;the characters in the play come to this martial arts world just like Zhao Benshan doesn&#39;t understand martial arts in reality&quot;, so that his performance will be very comfortable and natural. Therefore, the screenwriter designed two brothers who look the same, one is a hero and the other is a cook, with Zhao Benshan playing two roles. The studio explained: &quot;This is very consistent with Teacher Zhao&#39;s current state. He does not need to really know much about martial arts. The real hero is performing the task. The replacement comes to the martial arts world, and the replacement is the state of Teacher Zhao himself.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/pL2jTW2MAbI8Whm9ea6pDkEx4NiGkE9jgU0IeCdV.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;540&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/pL2jTW2MAbI8Whm9ea6pDkEx4NiGkE9jgU0IeCdV.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251392&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Except Zhao Benshan plays the leader of the Magpie Sect, and his disciples all have different personalities. In the impression of Chinese audiences, martial arts are often romantic, and the protagonists are all fairy-like and beautiful characters. &quot;Magpie Sword Gate&quot; breaks this inertial perception. The hero is an old man, the heroine is an old lady, and the apprentices are all silly, foolish, and stupid in their own way. The studio said that from the perspective of comedy creation, contrast must be set. These characters first contrast with the heroes in the traditional martial arts world. They want to be &quot;people in martial arts&quot; in the real world - they are Reckless played by Song Xiaofeng. The idiot second apprentice Zhao Dezhu and the stupid eldest apprentice Hao Meng played by Cheng Ye; of course, there must be someone who is not so stupid and can take on the audience&#39;s perspective, that is Jiang Yulang played by Wen Song. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Magpie Sword Gate&quot; is essentially a sitcom. If you want to do something different, the creator&#39;s approach is: the fight is real, and the funny is really funny. The large story structure and main line of this drama are left to the screenwriters who normally work on drama series. In addition, several screenwriting teams are set up to be responsible for submitting contrasting topics. Then the screenwriters work together to see what interesting topics can be arranged into the story, screen the topics multiple times, and ensure the quality and comedy effect through voting, interpretation, etc. The screenwriter of the selected topic needs to implement the burden of these topics based on the number of episodes he has been assigned and the development nodes and status of the corresponding characters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the barrage when &quot;Magpie Blade Gate&quot; was broadcast, the audience applauded for the satire of domestic entertainment chaos in the play. Many scenes follow hot topics and are spicy and sharp. For example, in order to become famous in the world, the sect in the play seeks the help of a storyteller to help arrange bizarre life experiences, hype up shocking scandals, and gain popularity; Position&quot;, the contestants obtained rankings through secret operations and character design, and immediately cut leeks to make quick money after their debut... All of this satirizes the strange phenomena in most of today&#39;s entertainment industry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although the final presentation of the series was good, the main creator still remembers some difficulties when looking back on the creative process: &quot;The most difficult thing is communicating with the actors.&quot; Because there are many people in the team Young screenwriters, many of whom are &quot;5G surfers&quot;, will inevitably incorporate the latest hot events and jokes into their scripts. Most of the actors are born in the 70s and 80s, and Zhao Benshan is even born in the 50s. How to make them truly understand the things in the script? A difficult point. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;The second most difficult part is the martial arts part.&quot; Because the director is a martial arts athlete, he has very high requirements for fighting scenes, but the comedian is not a martial arts actor after all, so the running-in process for this part is also quite intense. In the end, the fighting scenes in &quot;Magpie Sword Gate&quot; received many praises. The action moves are simple and neat, and have a traditional martial arts atmosphere. According to the creative team, this was a firm request from the director. &quot;We must make everyone believe that this world is real, and that is by returning to nature and fighting for real.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the opinion of the main creator, the show is made for the audience, and the audience&#39;s laughter is more important than anything else. In addition to &quot;laughing&quot;, what &quot;Magpie Sword Gate&quot; wants to convey and express is probably the word &quot;xia&quot;. As the ending of the play shows, being a hero is not about how much kung fu you know, but about a pattern and attitude towards doing things. &quot;I just want to say this to every ordinary person who is struggling in his or her position. Although we are not heroes in the traditional sense, we are actually already heroes in our own lives.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 23 Sep 2023 14:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[“十分审慎”“不宜推广”：“预制菜进校园”，争议彰显哪些问题？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257466]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-23 13:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Recently, some parents posted videos on social media: A school uniformly delivers pre-made meals, and meat dishes are Semi-finished products, vegetables are washed, cut, sealed in plastic bags, and sent to school the next day. This was strongly opposed by parents. Subsequently, there was a huge discussion and controversy on the Internet about the safety of prepared dishes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to Xinhua News Agency’s report on the evening of September 22, the head of the relevant departments and bureaus of the Ministry of Education said in an interview with reporters that in view of the fact that there is currently no unified standard system, certification system, traceability system, etc. for pre-made dishes. The supervision mechanism should be very cautious about &quot;prepared dishes entering campus&quot; and should not promote them into campus. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Ministry of Education expressed its position on &quot;prepared dishes entering schools&quot; and responded to many parents&#39; questions. Looking back on the discussions and controversies that have occurred on this topic these days, the views and attitudes of those directly involved, especially parents, should be fully respected. Although some experts say that prepared dishes are as safe as fresh meat and vegetables, many parents do believe that compared to meals made on site, prepared dishes pose more food safety risks. The safety and nutrition of school meals is by no means a trivial matter. Ensuring children’s dietary health is more related to the future. Only based on this premise can our understanding and analysis of this issue have real value. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First of all, after this debate, the safety of prepared dishes should be given full attention. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It must be clear that it is biased to simply draw the conclusion that pre-prepared dishes are safe or unsafe, because pre-prepared dishes are different from pre-prepared dishes. They have the same name &quot;pre-prepared dishes&quot;, but each person The understanding of the denotation and connotation of this concept may vary widely. The pre-made dishes with the same name are obviously different from those produced by small workshops. They also sell pre-made and ready-to-eat beef and salad. Big supermarkets use refrigeration to keep fresh, while roadside stalls allow them to be exposed to the scorching sun. The safety and quality are also guaranteed. different. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The following are common pre-prepared dishes: 1. Self-heating hot pot, high in oil and salt, stored at room temperature. It is very convenient to eat, but obviously cannot be eaten often; 2. Frozen storage introduced by some manufacturers . Heat-and-eat dishes, such as &quot;Kung Pao Chicken&quot; and &quot;Ma Po Tofu&quot;, are also high in oil and salt, and their taste is obviously inferior to those freshly made in restaurants; 3. From breeding and planting bases to industrialized assembly lines, they are processed into semi-finished products, and then The whole process is uninterrupted cold chain transportation and distribution, and restaurants and canteens purchase it and then make it into finished products. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From the perspective of health and taste, the first two are obviously not eaten frequently, so they cannot become mainstream. The third type is the development direction of prepared dishes worthy of discussion. If they are not stored properly or the cold chain cannot be guaranteed to be uninterrupted, these three types of prepared dishes may have safety issues. Prepared vegetables have a long chain of production process, from breeding and planting to slaughtering, processing, and cold chain transportation and distribution. Every link has safety risks, so scientific management is required to control risks and strictly follow operating procedures. Production. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Secondly, some parents are opposed to the introduction of prepared dishes into schools, which also reflects parents’ dissatisfaction with school cafeterias and schools for ignoring their rights to know, supervise and choose. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some parents reported that the school did not seek their opinions and made a unilateral decision to bring pre-made dishes to campus. To say what parents are opposed to in their hearts, in addition to concerns about the prepared dishes themselves, they also include but are not limited to the opacity of school management in the canteen, which makes their rights to know, supervise and choose missing or in vain, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is a parent group in my child’s primary school, which fully described a parent’s experience of supervising the canteen: Because some children reported that the dishes were small and tasted bad, some parents went to try them at noon one day ( This is the right of parental supervision recognized by the school). As a result, the dishes on that day were rich and tasted good. A parent who went to supervise said: &quot;My daughter came back and said that the food was unpalatable in the past two days. On the day I went, I was satisfied. There was plenty of meat in the dishes on the day I went.&quot; This may not have anything to do with the school, but this is how the catering company deals with parents. I believe there are more than one or two parents who are dissatisfied with their children’s meals at school. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Think about the fact that the right to operate a canteen in some schools can be sold for millions. Parents often have no say in the selection of catering companies. It is not difficult to understand parents&#39; distrust of schools and school cafeterias. In fact, even if there are no pre-prepared dishes, the meat bought freshly from the market may contain illegally added clenbuterol, and the vegetables may also contain excessive pesticide residues. Therefore, deciding whether it is safe or not based on fresh vs. frozen or pre-made is not the core or the most critical point of the problem. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;How to build parents’ confidence in schools and school cafeterias? The solution is also simple: take necessary measures to establish or re-establish the trust that should exist. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First, parents should have a certain right to speak and full rights to know and supervise in selecting the dishes cooked by catering companies, canteens or catering companies every day. If every parent wants to understand and participate informedly, they can do so at any time without hindrance. Sunshine is the best disinfectant. Transparency, openness and frankness can dispel all kinds of suspicions, concerns and worries. Schools, canteens or catering companies should be open-minded and act in accordance with conscience, operating procedures and professional ethics, and are not afraid of routine or surprise supervision from parents. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Second, all teachers and administrators in the school should eat the same dishes as the students. It can not only demonstrate the equality between teachers and students, but also, if both teachers and principals eat it, any concerns about food safety can be instantly eliminated, killing two birds with one stone. On this basis, parents&#39; trust in the school can be rebuilt. Only with trust can there be healthy and effective communication, and we can clarify various misunderstandings and solve various problems at any time. Children will also have more trust and identification with the school. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If you achieve these two points, many things will be solved easily. &quot;Whether prepared dishes can be brought to campus&quot; should be a matter of public discussion: What are the pros and cons of using prepared dishes or fresh meat and vegetables, and what is the difference in cost? Which catering company should you choose that is more conscientious and has guaranteed food safety? If canteens and catering companies use pre-prepared dishes, which company should they use? etc. Moreover, when parents have the right to speak, know, and participate, I believe that whether it is a catering company or a food production company, the first consideration is how to win the trust of parents, and the school cafeteria will have better safety. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（本文仅为作者个人观点，不代表本报立场）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 23 Sep 2023 13:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[杭州亚运运动员村——身在“村里”，如在“家里”]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257464]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-23 12:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;The Asian Games Village is the largest non-competition venue for the 19th Asian Games in Hangzhou.

&lt;p>;Previously, the Canadian government accused &quot;Indian government personnel&quot; of being involved in the murder of Canadian citizen Hardeep Singh Nijjar, but this was firmly denied by India. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Nijar is the leader of the Canadian Sikh community. On June 18, he was murdered outside a Sikh cultural center in British Columbia, Canada. The case triggered strong protests from the Canadian Sikh community, demanding that the Canadian government solve the case as soon as possible and bring the murderer to justice. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On September 18, Canadian Prime Minister Trudeau mentioned the matter when speaking in the House of Commons, saying that he had obtained &quot;credible&quot; evidence that the Indian government was involved. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;India and Canada are far apart. Why does a case that happened thousands of miles away involve the Indian government? Why did the latter react so violently? This is related to the &quot;Khalistan&quot; (that is, the Sikh independence movement) movement in India. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;How to solve the issue of the status of the Sikhs has always been a family scandal that successive Indian governments have tried hard to cover up. The incident of India and Canada expelling diplomats from each other has once again attracted widespread attention from the international community. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Are you no longer afraid of having your family scandal exposed? &lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>; &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Successive Indian governments have always been highly vigilant about the return of the &quot;Khalistan&quot; movement. When the governments of countries where overseas Sikhs live show support and condone behavior, India will use various channels to implement measures. pressure, but generally adhere to the principle of low-key handling in order to minimize the opportunity for the &quot;Khalistan&quot; movement to express its claims. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After taking office, the Modi government has shown new thinking on ethnic issues, and its domestic and foreign policies and statements have become increasingly stronger. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Domestically, the Modi government’s economic and social development policies continue to sacrifice the well-being of India’s minority groups. Violent incidents against ethnic minorities by Hindu extremist organizations occur from time to time, and the economic and social conditions of the Sikhs in India are deteriorating day by day. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Abroad, Modi insists on exporting Hindu nationalist ideas among overseas Indians. Whenever he visits foreign countries, he will use Hindu elements to hold large gatherings to build support for the cause of Hindu nationalism among overseas Hindus. . The Modi government&#39;s ethnic policies have successfully brought sharply antagonistic ethnic relations at home to Indian groups overseas. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2002, Modi was serving as Chief Minister of Gujarat. The state government led by him was accused of adopting a policy of inaction in response to riots and even condoning attacks, resulting in thousands of casualties. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After taking office as Prime Minister of India, Modi took a very strong position on the issue of overseas Sikhs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The first is to increase pressure on host governments and require these countries to take practical measures to combat so-called anti-India activities in their own countries. Senior Indian officials have repeatedly accused the United States and Europe of using the &quot;Khalistan&quot; movement to involve issues of Indian sovereignty in public. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The second is to support overseas Hindus and rush to the forefront of opposing overseas Sikhs. Overseas, when Sikh demonstrations occur, overseas Hindus are often arranged to hold tit-for-tat activities at the same time. People from both sides exchanged insults, and overseas Hindus and overseas Sikhs even caused conflicts in the streets, forcing the host government to intervene by creating social security incidents. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As the United States has deepened its reliance on India, European and American countries have been less concerned about issues such as the status of the Sikhs for some time. The Modi government has emphasized its strong strategy to deal with overseas Sikh issues. It seems to be quite effective. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since the Russia-Ukraine conflict, India has not followed the United States and Europe in imposing comprehensive sanctions on Russia. Disappointed, the United States and Europe will no longer tolerate concessions to India&#39;s actions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In recent years, the intention of the United States and Europe to use the status of the Sikhs to attack India has become increasingly obvious. The United States took the lead in attacking India. For example, in May 2022, the state of Connecticut passed a resolution declaring that April 29 was recognized as the &quot;Sikh Declaration of Independence Day.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As we enter 2023, &quot;Khalistan&quot; gatherings have occurred one after another in the United States, Australia and the United Kingdom, and activists have also had violent clashes with local Indians. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Canada, anti-India demonstrations have also occurred frequently since 2023, and India-Canada relations have continued to be tense. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Confrontation&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Canada has expressed its views on the Sikh issue from time to time. India has always been quite dissatisfied and regards Canada as the overseas base camp of the &quot;Khalistan&quot; movement. one. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At present, the number of Sikhs in Canada is about 770,000, accounting for about 2.21% of Canada’s total population, which is equivalent to the proportion of Sikhs in India’s total population. Sikhs generally develop well in Canada, have higher economic and social status, and have greater political influence in the local area. For example, when Trudeau became Prime Minister of Canada in 2015, his cabinet included four Sikh ministerial officials. Sikhs also have a relatively high representation rate in Canadian parliaments at all levels. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When Modi first took office as Prime Minister of India, he had quarrels with Canada over the Sikh issue. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In April 2015, when Modi paid his first state visit to Canada, India attached great importance to it. However, some organizations in Canada immediately held protests and marches, demanding that the Canadian government investigate Modi’s 2002 murder in Gujarat. A high-profile state visit was tarnished by his dereliction of duty amid ethnic riots. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As the United States and Europe begin to revisit this disagreement, India and Canada have had many confrontations over the Sikh issue, adding uncertainties to the already troubled bilateral relations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Canada, two incidents occurred in June 2023, exacerbating tensions between the two sides. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First, on June 4, the Sikhs held a parade to protest against the &quot;Operation Blue Star&quot; launched by the Indian government that year, and used a float parade to recreate the scene of Indira Gandhi&#39;s assassination. . The Indian government protests that Canada has violated its sovereignty and dignity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Then on June 18, Nijar, the famous leader of Canada’s “Khalistan Independence Referendum”, was shot dead by two gunmen in the street. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Even if Canada’s concerns about the Sikhs in India are not taken into account, the Indian government’s involvement in the assassination of a Canadian citizen has involved Canadian sovereignty and is a serious criminal case. This can be said to have touched the bottom line of the Canadian government. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During the G20 summit in early September, the host Modi did not hold a one-on-one meeting with Trudeau. Instead, he expressed &quot;strong concern&quot; about &quot;Canadian extremists&#39; continued anti-India activities&quot;, which triggered strong opposition from Canada. dissatisfied. Then came Trudeau’s latest briefing on the Nijar incident mentioned above, emphasizing that he had obtained “credible” evidence and that the Modi government could not escape its involvement. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;India and Canada not only expelled diplomats from each other, but also interrupted negotiations on a free trade agreement. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;The Sikh Question&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;,&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;India’s&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Thunder&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>; strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;India&#39;s &quot;dissension&quot; on the Sikh issue has a lot to do with the historical grievances of ethnic conflicts in India that led to the emigration of Sikhs overseas. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the latest census by the Population Registration and Survey Commission of India, there are about 20 million Sikhs, accounting for about 2% of the total Hindu population. The Indian state of Punjab has one of the largest concentrations of Sikhs.旁遮普邦总人口2770万，其中信奉锡克教的人口占57.69%，约1600万人。在旁遮普，锡克人是多数族群，从印度全国范围来看，锡克人又是绝对的少数族群，这种态势造就了锡克人独特的政治地位。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;锡克教起源于15世纪的印度，创始人那纳克上师因反对印度教的种姓压迫，提出了“人人平等、平等待人”的口号。锡克教族群内部凝聚力强且有尚武风气，勤劳肯干，在印度有着较高的经济和社会地位，但锡克人政治地位问题，是印度最敏感的内政问题之一。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;自印度独立以来，锡克人一直希望在印度联邦体制下获得更多自治权，在不同时期开展的分权运动也取得一定成果，包括1966年原旁遮普邦被一分为二，这使得锡克人历史上首次成为一个地方邦的多数族群。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;20世纪70年代末，印度旁遮普邦的锡克人再次掀起了一场非暴力的地区自治运动，但印度政府采取了强力镇压，其中尤以1984年6月3日“蓝星行动”造成的影响为最大。当时，印度武装部队动用坦克、火炮和直升机在内的重型装备，攻入武装分子盘踞的阿姆利则大金庙，造成巨大伤亡，也对神圣的金庙建筑造成损坏。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;锡克人把“蓝星行动”与历史上自身遭遇的外族入侵和大屠杀相提并论，激起了印度国内外锡克人同仇敌忾的情绪，印度多地出现锡克士兵哗变。 “蓝星行动”造成了锡克教徒与印度教徒之间的严重对立。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;作为报复行动之一，1984年10月31日，时任印度总理英迪拉·甘地被自己的两名锡克族保镖刺杀，英迪拉遇刺一事又激发印度国内大范围的印度教徒袭击锡克教徒事件，至少有3000名锡克人遇难。此后，两个族群之间的关系走向完全对立，事件也逐渐演变成锡克人争取独立的武装分离主义叛乱。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;到1993年，这场“卡利斯坦运动”叛乱被认为基本平息，在此期间共造成了21443人死亡，包括11694名平民、1746名武装部队士兵和8003名武装分子。此后，很多锡克人移居海外，主要散落美加英澳等国。如今，约150万锡克教徒生活在印度国土之外，成为海外印度人的重要组成部分，而印度政府在“蓝星行动”中冒犯大金庙以及大规模追铺和杀害锡克民众的记忆，在海外锡克人中一直存续。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;截至目前，事件仍在发酵，美国、澳大利亚和英国都表达了严重关切。到底是印方笃定特鲁多不会公开案件关键证据，还是特鲁多拿出证据将莫迪钉在持续迫害锡克人的耻辱柱上，目前尚未可知。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;其实，整个事件最受伤的，反而是第三方即美国。美国拜登政府近年来倾力打造所谓民主国家联盟，无论是美日印澳四国集团，还是美英加澳新“五眼联盟”，事件的两个当事方都是重要成员。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;如今民主同盟尚未建成已现裂痕，作为盟主的美国是否亲自斡旋？斡旋效果能有几何？我们拭目以待。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;（作者为复旦大学南亚研究中心副研究员）&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 23 Sep 2023 11:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[教育部：对“预制菜进校园”持审慎态度]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257458]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-23 10:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;近期，一些地方“预制菜进校园”话题受到社会广泛关注。近日，记者就“预制菜进校园”采访教育部有关司局负责人。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;据这位负责人介绍，学校食品安全和营养健康事关学生健康成长，教育部长期以来会同相关部门，切实落实党中央、国务院决策部署，严格落实食品安全法等法律法规，先后制定实施了《学校食品安全与营养健康管理规定》《营养与健康学校建设指南》等制度规定，不断加强对学校食品安全和营养健康的管理。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;食品安全法第五十七条规定，学校等集中用餐单位的食堂应当严格遵守法律、法规和食品安全标准；从供餐单位订餐的，应当从取得食品生产经营许可的企业订购，并按照要求对订购的食品进行查验。供餐单位应当严格遵守法律、法规和食品安全标准，当餐加工，确保食品安全。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这位负责人指出，党和政府高度重视学校食品安全，十分关心学生健康成长，广大家长期望孩子在学校吃得既绿色安全又营养健康。经研究，鉴于当前预制菜还没有统一的标准体系、认证体系、追溯体系等有效监管机制，对“预制菜进校园”应持十分审慎态度，不宜推广进校园。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;获取更多RSS：&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 23 Sep 2023 10:25:03 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
