With a head weighing 800 kilograms, it is quite a battle to &quot;move&quot; such a big man over a long distance. It not only requires cranes and large trucks, but also requires more than 20 adults to carry it. So the question is, how many steps does it take to &quot;move&quot; a pilot whale? What is the greatest difficulty? What preparations have the staff made to protect the pilot whales? &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;What are the steps to “move” a pilot whale? &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;It is not an easy task to &quot;move&quot; a pilot whale weighing about 800 kilograms, and to move both animals together. So, what are the steps to &quot;move&quot; a pilot whale? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The staff said that there are five steps to &quot;moving&quot; the pilot whale this time. The first step: Capture and transportation, after capturing the pilot whale from the breeding tank, transport it to the box; The second step: Putting into the box and hoisting; The third step: Inspection before transportation, including the pilot whale’s breathing frequency, Check the mental state, etc.; Step 4: Monitoring during transportation, including monitoring of water temperature, air temperature, mental state, activity state, respiratory rate, etc. of animals during transportation; Step 5: After arriving at the destination, hoist into the water . &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;What are the living habits of pilot whales? Why did it get its name? &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;To successfully &quot;move&quot; a big guy like a pilot whale, you need to understand its physiological characteristics and living habits. Next, let’s get to know the large marine creature-pilot whale. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Pilot whales are mammals in the family Cetacea, Delphinidae, and are also called &quot;pilot whales&quot; because of their huge size. Pilot whales are divided into two types: long-limbed pilot whales and short-limbed pilot whales. Long-limbed pilot whales are mainly distributed in high-latitude waters, while short-limbed pilot whales are distributed in tropical and temperate waters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/19/22f69f961e179bf7552d09428fac69b7.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;1280&quot; height=&quot;659&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/19/22f69f961e179bf7552d09428fac69b7.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;258780&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Sun Dong, associate researcher at the Second Institute of Oceanography of the Ministry of Natural Resources:&lt;/strong>;Pilot whales generally like to gather in large groups in the natural marine environment. The size of this group can usually reach 200 to 300. , this is a very large scale, which is rare among whales. Pilot whales are the liveliest among cetaceans. Pilot whales are often seen by sailors willing to accompany sailboats or ships when the ship is sailing on the sea. Their playful behavior. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In recent years, due to the destruction of the marine environment, the number of pilot whales has been declining, and they have been included in the second level of my country&#39;s &quot;List of National Key Protected Wild Animals&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;What are the difficulties for the &quot;big&quot; pilot whale to &quot;move&quot;? &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In addition to their large size and heavy weight, what are the difficulties in &quot;moving&quot; pilot whales? Come on and listen to the expert’s introduction. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Sun Dong, associate researcher at the Second Institute of Oceanography of the Ministry of Natural Resources:&lt;/strong>;From the most professional perspective, the most important thing about the &quot;movement&quot; of whales is that we call this whale Cetaceans need to use their lungs to breathe, so the vent on its back, or in layman&#39;s terms, its nostrils must be exposed above the water to prevent it from drowning. Cetaceans can drown. But the water cannot be put in very little. If it is put in very little, one will cause its skin to become dry and dehydrated. Dehydration is a very serious event for cetaceans. The second is the huge body of cetaceans. , it needs the buoyancy of water to support its weight. Another factor is temperature. For cetaceans, especially when the temperature rises, it will cause them to suffer from overheating shock. This should be strictly avoided. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Why do pilot whales need to apply Vaseline when they “go out”? &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;When it comes to &quot;moving&quot; a &quot;big guy&quot; like a pilot whale, every detail is important. There is such a detail in the transfer process that the reporter just photographed. After the pilot whale came out of the water, the staff smeared Vaseline on the pilot whale. Why did they do this? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Liu Quansheng, technical director of a polar marine park in Hangzhou:&lt;/strong>;The pilot whales apply Vaseline to prevent dehydration, because when the temperature is too high, cetaceans can easily dehydrate. After covering it with Vaseline, it will prevent moisture from dispersing. After applying Vaseline, we will cover it with a layer of wet towel. In this way, it has a water-retaining effect, that is, one is to prevent dehydration and the other is to moisturize. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Experts told reporters that this time the two pilot whales &quot;moved&quot;, they were smeared with medical Vaseline which had almost no harm to their skin. The main area of ​​application was the back skin exposed to the air, but Avoid air vents when applying. Two pilot whales arrived at their &quot;new home&quot; in Zhoushan. Before entering the water, the staff used a towel to wipe off the Vaseline on the pilot whales. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;How to reduce the stress response of pilot whales during transportation? &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;From Hangzhou to Zhoushan, it spans more than 200 kilometers. To ensure the safety of the animals, the vehicle must maintain a stable speed of 90 kilometers per hour during transportation. This extended the original drive of more than 2 hours to 5 hours. How can pilot whales reduce their stress response during long-distance transfers and reach their &quot;new home&quot; safely? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Liu Quansheng, technical director of a polar marine park in Hangzhou:&lt;/strong>;We will stop eating 24 hours before transportation, and gradually reduce the amount of food in the first three days. This is the first ; Second, we will ensure appropriate water and air temperatures during transportation. This time we set the water temperature for the pilot whale at 23.5°C, which is a water temperature that is more suitable for raising it; third, we We need to ensure that the air in this transport vehicle circulates, that it cannot be too hot or too windy, and that it must be enclosed. Fourthly, we will have accompanying veterinarians and keepers who have raised it for a long time, who will caress and carry it out. An exchange. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to allow the pilot whales to adapt to the new environment as quickly as possible, the room temperature, water temperature, lighting and other aspects of Zhoushan&#39;s &quot;new home&quot; are set according to the natural environment in which they live. However, in the first two days after arrival, the staff will feed a small amount of food, and then resume a normal diet after the pilot whales slowly adapt. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 19 Nov 2023 16:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[商务部清理歧视外资措施，废除“特斯拉禁入”是个好的开始丨快评]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260899]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-19 15:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;A spokesman for the Ministry of Commerce recently stated at a regular press conference that the Ministry of Commerce has recently organized a special cleanup to further investigate Regulations and measures that may exist that discriminate against foreign-funded enterprises will create a fairer market competition environment for foreign-funded enterprises. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the website of the Ministry of Commerce, the Department of Foreign Investment of the Ministry of Commerce issued a document on November 8, requiring a special cleanup of regulations and measures containing unreasonable differential treatment of domestic and foreign capital. The scope of the cleanup includes laws, regulations, normative documents, and other policy measures issued by local governments and departments, as well as various measures related to business entities formulated by relevant departments. The document also lists a number of specific cleanup matters, including restrictions on foreign investment in access areas, discriminating or excluding foreign-invested enterprises and their products and services on the grounds of foreign brands, excluding or restricting foreign-invested enterprises from participating in government procurement, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Ministry of Commerce’s special clean-up operation is targeted. In recent years, with the improvement of China&#39;s economic strength and external trade frictions such as &quot;decoupling and breaking links&quot;, there has been a domestic argument that &quot;it is strong enough and no longer needs foreign investment.&quot; There are also more and more comments on social media that are hostile to foreign brand products, and there are even restrictions on foreign brand products in some places. Some time ago, Hunan Yueyang Sanhe Airport banned Tesla electric vehicles from entering the airport on the grounds of &quot;confidential control.&quot; After attracting great attention, Yueyang Airport lifted this restriction, but similar phenomena still exist in many local departments. In addition to Tesla, Apple&#39;s mobile phones and other electronic products also receive special &quot;care&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This kind of restriction on foreign brands has no legal basis. In September 2023, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning stated at a press conference that China has not issued laws, regulations or policy documents prohibiting the purchase and use of foreign brand mobile phones such as Apple. The reason why some departments and companies ban Tesla cars, Apple mobile phones, etc. is that their cameras, microphones and other sensors may obtain surrounding environment information and upload it abroad, which involves &quot;state secrets&quot; and &quot;personal information security&quot;. However, according to Tesla&#39;s statement, the video captured by its car&#39;s &quot;Sentinel Mode&quot; is only stored in the vehicle&#39;s local storage device and will not be uploaded to the Internet. Other vehicle data will only be uploaded to the company&#39;s data center in China. The iCloud service used by Apple&#39;s domestic users is also operated by the domestic big data company &quot;Cloud Guizhou&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although Tesla and Apple are foreign brands, their products sold domestically are basically produced in factories in China. Their super factory in Shanghai has more than 10,000 employees. In addition, the localization rate of Tesla&#39;s auto parts has exceeded 95%, which has stimulated the development of many domestic companies in the upstream industrial chain, not only bringing income to the employees of these companies, but also improving the production level of the companies. The improvement of the production capacity of these enterprises has also provided energy for the development of other domestic automobile manufacturers. The same is true for Apple. Not only does its domestic foundries directly provide jobs for hundreds of thousands of people, but it also greatly improves the capabilities of the domestic industrial chain through strict management of domestic suppliers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Introducing foreign capital is not just about hundreds of millions or even billions of money, but more importantly, entrepreneurial spirit and talent, which is to discover or even &quot;create&quot; market opportunities and seize them. , the ability to create social wealth. During the process of reform and opening up, the introduction of foreign investment has played a huge role in promoting China&#39;s economic development. This impetus does not only come from money itself. China&#39;s goal of introducing foreign investment is not only to solve the problem of insufficient domestic development funds, but more importantly, to &quot;learn advanced Western technology and management experience.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, it may be the competition, management and other concepts that come with foreign investment that play a greater role in promoting China&#39;s development. It is precisely because of the pressure of foreign capital that China&#39;s market-oriented reform has been accelerated, and domestic enterprises have also strengthened their bodies and developed in the competition with foreign capital. Even though China has now become the world&#39;s second largest economy, it still needs to introduce foreign investment. Because in many areas, China still needs foreign technology and entrepreneurial talents. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In August 2023, the State Council issued the &quot;24 Policies and Measures for Attracting Foreign Investment,&quot; emphasizing the need to create a &quot;market-oriented, legal, and international first-class business environment.&quot; A market-oriented and legalized business environment requires that foreign-invested enterprises be treated equally and receive national treatment. As long as they are not within the scope of the negative list stipulated by the state, there cannot be any discrimination or restrictions on foreign investment. The products and services provided by domestic foreign-funded enterprises should also be treated equally with those of other domestic enterprises. Just like although the &quot;Government Procurement Law&quot; stipulates that under normal circumstances government procurement &quot;should purchase domestic goods, projects and services,&quot; the Ministry of Finance issued a special document in 2021 requiring that except for procurement projects involving national security and state secrets, government procurement must not distinguish Treat products produced in China by domestic and foreign-funded enterprises. As long as it is produced within China, regardless of whether its suppliers are domestic or foreign, their equal participation in government procurement should be guaranteed. This special clean-up operation by the Ministry of Commerce also includes the issue of restricting foreign-invested enterprises from participating in local bidding and government procurement as a clean-up matter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the Ministry of Commerce’s cleanup operation began, social media information showed that some local agencies’ “No Tesla Entry” signs had been removed. Prohibiting discrimination against foreign-owned enterprises is a good start. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 19 Nov 2023 15:25:05 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[人为什么变胖，问题可能没那么简单]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260883]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-19 14:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;The global obesity and overweight problems have become increasingly apparent in recent decades. According to data from the World Health Organization, in 2016 Nearly 40% of adults worldwide are overweight, of which 13% are obese. There are approximately 2 billion overweight people. This increase continues despite public health measures to prevent and slow obesity in many countries. Along with the obesity epidemic comes a large disease burden. How to better manage weight has become an urgent problem in the field of health sciences. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Balancing the quality and quantity of carbohydrates&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Carbohydrates, as a major source of dietary energy for people, have long been the focus of weight loss. Coping strategies such as the &quot;ketogenic diet&quot; of eating less or no staple food, or even strictly limiting carbohydrate intake have been derived. The &quot;ketogenic diet&quot; cuts off carbohydrates as an energy source and attempts to promote weight loss by burning fat to provide energy. Although this method has some short-term experimental support, what will happen if it is persisted in the long term is still a mystery. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Moreover, the &quot;ketogenic diet&quot; requires maintaining a high level of fat intake while maximizing carbohydrate intake, which may increase the risk related to cardiovascular disease. In addition, it will also put pressure on the liver, kidneys and maintenance of nutritional balance, and there is a risk of a series of adverse reactions such as cognitive decline, constipation, fatigue, and nausea. Therefore, long-term adherence to such a diet for weight loss remains controversial. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, compared with the controversial &quot;ketogenic diet&quot; that strictly limits carbohydrate intake, a diet that reasonably controls carbohydrates has actually been widely recognized, including paying more attention to nutritional balance and simplicity. Processed “Mediterranean Diet” etc. Recently, scientists from Harvard School of Public Health and other institutions also found through long-term observational studies that instead of focusing generally on the total amount of carbohydrate intake, it is better to pay more attention to the quality and source of carbohydrates, so as to achieve better long-term weight management. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Because their research data shows that some carbohydrate-containing foods do make you fatter as you eat them, but there are also some carbohydrate-rich foods that may actually have a weight loss effect if you eat too much of them. Overall, higher glycemic index and glycemic load will lead to weight gain. Adding 100 grams of starch or added sugar per day increased weight gain by 1.5 kilograms and 0.9 kilograms respectively over four years. Relevant research was published in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) in September 2023. The main sources of daily starch are seeds and tubers such as wheat and rice, which are various staple foods. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Starchy vegetables such as potatoes and peas, and refined grains are also associated with weight gain. A 100-gram daily intake increase will increase weight gain by 2.6 kilograms and 0.8 kilograms respectively. But if it is non-starchy vegetables and whole grains, the increase in intake will actually reduce weight gain and help control weight. Increasing the intake of non-starchy vegetables by 100 grams per day will reduce weight gain by 3 kilograms, and the intake of 100 grams of whole grains will reduce weight gain by 0.4 kilograms. Similarly, consuming carbohydrates through fruits can also help reduce weight gain, with a daily intake increase of 100 grams corresponding to 1.6 kilograms less weight gain. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The reason why these data are limited to four years to assess weight change is because some health data in the study are updated on a four-year cycle. Using data from more than 130,000 people in projects such as the Nurses&#39; Health Study, researchers analyzed the relationship between people&#39;s diet and weight changes over more than two decades and discovered these overall patterns of carbohydrates. Over the past two decades, people&#39;s average weight has increased by 8.8 kilograms, about 1.5 kilograms every four years. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Highly processed carbohydrates have become a target&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;If a person pays more attention to the management of carbohydrate quality and sources, use equal amounts of non-starchy vegetables, fruits and Substituting whole grains for foods like refined grains, starchy vegetables, and sugary drinks will result in less weight gain. In addition to foods such as vegetables and whole grains that are consumed in large amounts, an increase in dietary fiber intake also helps with weight management. Every 10 grams of increase per day corresponds to a reduction of 0.8 kilograms of weight gain. Considering that the age of the people in the study happens to span the middle-aged and elderly stages, including the critical period of weight gain in middle age, this large-sample long-term follow-up study has important reference significance for middle-aged people to strengthen weight management. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, although the latest research data has the advantages of large volume and long follow-up time, and can capture more changes in diet and health, there are still some limitations, such as carbohydrate intake and Information such as weight is reported by the respondents themselves. There may be certain errors in these data, which will affect relevant conclusions and interpretations. To better understand the long-term health effects of carbohydrates, more randomized, controlled, long-term studies are needed to further confirm the conclusions in the latest findings. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for why people become obese, the most popular explanation is energy imbalance, which is commonly known as &quot;eating more and moving less&quot;, but this is not the exact answer to the common obesity phenomenon in humans. As obesity rates remain high, some scientists think the problem may not be that simple. Two common explanations currently take into account more complex body system factors. For example, one view is that on the basis that energy intake exceeds consumption, because modern people eat too much ultra-processed food with high energy density, there may also be endocrine, metabolic and nervous system effects, making it more difficult for people to eat food. Self-control. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another explanation related to insulin is that the hormonal response triggered by a large amount of ultra-processed carbohydrates causes the body to store more energy in fat, resulting in a lack of energy required for basic metabolism of the body. , after the brain recognizes this state, it will issue a hunger command, thus entering a vicious cycle of getting fatter and overeating. While the understanding of obesity remains controversial, these analyzes and a host of health studies have focused on carbohydrates in processed foods, including all types of so-called &quot;junk food&quot; that are high in sugar and fat. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ultra-processed carbohydrates are classified as &quot;junk food&quot;, which is not unrelated to the current scientific community&#39;s understanding of the functions of carbohydrates. Carbohydrates are the only macronutrient for which there is no minimum intake requirement. In reality, in some places people eat a lot, but in other places people eat very little. What specific ranges of carbohydrate intake humans need to maintain in order to survive, be healthy, and even live longer are specific questions that need to be answered by scientific evidence. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;The risks and costs of eating out&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;From an evolutionary perspective, larger brain capacity is consistent with the evolutionary process of humans, and larger brain capacity is consistent with the evolutionary process of humans. The brain needs more energy support. After humans entered agricultural civilization, typical lifestyle changes included growing and eating grains, which are foods rich in carbohydrates. For this reason, the human digestive system has become more adapted to starch, but accordingly, new eating habits have also brought about a series of new health problems. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Latest research suggests that the mechanisms by which carbohydrates, glycemic index, and glycemic load may have negative health effects on weight may include enhanced responses to changes in insulin and other hormones that favor fat accumulation. . In recent years, some studies have shown that in addition to weight gain, the quality of carbohydrates may also increase a series of other health risks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2019, a systematic analysis study published in The Lancet showed that compared with those who ate the least dietary fiber, people who ate the most dietary fiber had better health outcomes. The risks of a range of diseases are 15% to 30% lower, including lower cardiovascular disease mortality, coronary heart disease incidence, stroke incidence and mortality, and lower risks of type 2 diabetes and colorectal cancer. In addition, clinical trial data also shows that eating more dietary fiber will lower blood pressure and total cholesterol. The lowest risk dietary fiber intake is 25 to 29 grams per day. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Similarly, studies have found that whole grain intake may also help reduce overall disease risk. Increasing the intake of dietary fiber in the daily diet, replacing refined grains with whole grains, and eating more coarse grains will not only help with weight management, but also improve people&#39;s health. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is worth noting that with the epidemic of obesity in recent years, scientists have tried to verify a variety of weight loss and weight management strategies, most of which are related to &quot;eating&quot;, including the total energy of meals and the amount of food consumed. time. In 2022, a one-year intermittent fasting trial carried out in China found that while restricting food energy, arranging eating times from 8 am to 4 pm every day and not eating at other times, such a The weight loss effect of this dietary pattern is no better than that of energy restriction alone, indicating the importance of controlling energy intake for weight loss. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, in April 2023, Australian researchers further narrowed the eating time window to 8 am to 12 noon every day, limiting the intake of 30% of the required energy to only these four hours. And you stick to this eating method for three non-consecutive days in a week, and you can eat whatever you want at other times. The experimental results found that under certain circumstances, intermittent fasting that limits meal times still has its own unique effect, not only can Lowering the weight of trial participants could also improve people&#39;s glucose tolerance and reduce their risk of type 2 diabetes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Leonie Heilbronn, a professor at the University of Adelaide School of Medicine and others who have long studied fasting and meal times, explained to Southern Weekend reporters that human metabolism is governed by biological rhythms The brain operates downwards, alternating between day and night 24 hours a day. Improper eating time will cause the brain&#39;s light and dark rhythms to be out of sync with the biological clocks in other organs and tissues. Moving meals earlier and avoiding eating at night will help the body coordinate these rhythms. combine. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2022, a randomized controlled trial in the UK also supported the conclusion of eating early, but it was not because of differences in metabolism at different times, but because the study at that time found that if you eat more in the morning, your overall health will be reduced throughout the day. If the meal time is moved forward, people will not feel too hungry that day, and appetite and total energy intake will be controlled. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Weight management should be a long-term plan&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;For weight control, no matter what the strategy is or how difficult it is, whether it can be persisted in the long term is the key to weight management. key. Otherwise, no matter how radical and rapid the weight loss method is, it will rebound when you can&#39;t persist, and destroy people&#39;s confidence in weight management during the continuous rebound. Some people whose obesity problem is particularly serious and whose weight loss through conventional methods has been ineffective can only reduce their health risks through extremely limited methods such as bariatric surgery. However, this method requires the removal of part of the stomach, which is extremely invasive and does not work. Not suitable for most people who have less severe weight problems. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From this perspective, the latest research controls weight by managing the source of carbohydrates, which does not involve harsh food intake restrictions or long fasting times, and has positive implications for people&#39;s long-term weight management. significance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Moreover, the researchers also found that the relationship between carbohydrate sources and weight management was more obvious in overweight or obese people than in people of normal weight, indicating that these people may be more susceptible to weight changes. Sensitive, more fragile, but in turn suggests that those who pay more attention to the sources of carbohydrates in their diet may benefit more from this type of weight management. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Reflected in specific foods, it is necessary to limit sugary drinks and various types of steamed, fried, and baked refined rice noodles, and instead eat more roughly processed grains, fruits, and non-starchy foods. Vegetables etc. The &quot;Mediterranean diet&quot; widely praised by scientists is actually more scientific in managing carbohydrate sources and maintaining nutritional balance. In addition to consuming more vegetables, fruits, and whole grains, it also eats more beans and nuts, and more Fish and moderate amounts of poultry and dairy, but not a lot of red meat. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 19 Nov 2023 14:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[拿电动汽车对比主战坦克：券商的“奇葩研报”为何层出不穷？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260891]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-19 13:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Recently, a screenshot of a research report comparing BYD’s U8 and T-90 main battle tanks was exposed. This screenshot of the research report comes from the special research report on BYD released by the Western Securities R&amp;D Center on October 24, 2023: &quot;BYD (002594.SZ) first coverage report: Cost is the shield, technology is the spear, and the sword points at the global automotive leader&quot; . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On page 26 of the research report, in order to present the output power of BYD&#39;s Yi Sifang four-wheel motor, Western Securities compared the output power, engine, and body of BYD&#39;s U8 and T-90 main battle tanks. , amphibious, on-site U-turn, lateral travel, zero-hundred acceleration and the number of driving wheels, and concluded: &quot;The technical indicators of Yi Sifang&#39;s four-wheel motor are comprehensively leading the industry.&quot; Looking up at the amphibious and lateral travel functions of U8, T -90 tanks are &quot;none&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to Blue Whale Finance, a relevant person from Western Securities responded that the report was not written by an intern, and that the comparison of BYD’s U8 with main battle tanks was affected by relevant publicity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What is the impact of relevant publicity? Previously, many self-media compared BYD’s U8 with tanks. Regardless of whether the research report of Western Securities was influenced by self-media, but comparing electric vehicles with main battle tanks, and then claiming that its technical indicators are comprehensively leading the industry, whether the relevant arguments and conclusions are rigorous and reasonable will naturally be questioned by investors and public opinion. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, in June this year, Western Securities and analysts were punished for research reports. According to the warning letter from the Shaanxi Supervision Bureau of the China Securities Regulatory Commission: After investigation, the internal control mechanism for the securities research report publishing business of Western Securities is not sound, individual surveys did not fulfill the pre-approval procedures, sales staff participated in the assessment of research report analysts, and compliance management did not cover expert consulting services. The main business links; the quality control and review of research reports are not strict, and some research reports have unreasonable valuation forecasts and imprudent conclusions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The relevant securities research report produced by Luo Yamein, the signed analyst of BYD’s research report, has problems such as imprudent research methods, lack of reasonable justification for some assumptions, and insufficient basis for some conclusions. Not only was it shown The warning letter is also recorded in the securities and futures market integrity files. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Less than half a year later, Western Securities and the same analyst released another controversial research report. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, this was not done by a securities firm called Western Securities. In recent years, there have been numerous cases of securities companies being fined for &quot;weird research reports&quot;. On December 30, 2021, the Jiangxi Securities Regulatory Bureau issued two law enforcement documents, punishing Guosheng Securities and its researchers for their conduct related to the research report &quot;A Preliminary Study on the Application of Heavenly Stems and Earthly Branches in Timing&quot;. On October 18 of that year, a report titled &quot;A Preliminary Study on the Application of Heavenly Stems and Earthly Branches in Timing&quot; by Guosheng Securities attracted public attention. In the report, it is explained in detail how the &quot;Heavenly Stems and Earthly Branches&quot; dominate the market&#39;s time cycle, and how to apply the &quot;Heavenly Stems and Earthly Branches&quot; in timing. Liu Fubing, who issued this research report, has been in the industry for more than 12 years and has been listed as the best analyst of New Fortune 8 times, including No. 1 6 times. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If we say that the above-mentioned research report is &quot;even if it is not shocking, it will never stop&quot;, so it has become a talking point for people. There is also a type of &quot;weird research reports&quot; that are more likely to mislead investors. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In July 2020, the Jiangsu Securities Regulatory Bureau posted an administrative penalty decision against two analysts Ma Haobo who signed the research report &quot;Fucheng In-depth Report 2: Three 10 billion to support doubling of market value&quot; , Tang Weiliang were fined a total of 200,000 yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2016, a research report released by Soochow Securities boldly predicted that Fucheng Shares (600965.SH), &quot;the number one A-share funeral stock&quot;, would be the absolute leader in the funeral industry in the future. And gave Fucheng shares a &quot;buy&quot; rating. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, on October 25 of that year, Fucheng Shares issued a &quot;clarification announcement&quot; to clarify the relevant contents of the research report. Soochow Securities&#39; &quot;Fucheng Research Report&quot; stated that the number of tombs after the completion of the third phase of Fucheng&#39;s pagoda cemetery will reach 400,000. Based on this data, it was concluded that Fucheng&#39;s net profit would be 15.5 billion yuan. After investigation, Fucheng Co., Ltd.&#39;s pagoda cemetery plans to build about 125,000 tombs. &quot;Fucheng Research Report&quot; also stated that the industrial merger and acquisition fund jointly established by Fucheng Co., Ltd. and an investment company has a total scale of 10 billion yuan. The current scale is 1 billion yuan, and the follow-up fund scale will be 9 billion yuan. After investigation, as of October 2016, the size of the above-mentioned M&amp;A fund was only 1 billion yuan. The status of subsequent funds will need to be made by Fucheng Shares based on the progress of the first-phase fund and the quality of the assets acquired. Third, &quot;Fucheng Research Report&quot; stated that the company&#39;s major shareholders have 10 billion in cash and have sufficient funds to serve as the backend of the above-mentioned merger and acquisition funds. After investigation, as of October 2016, the major shareholders had not made a decision in this regard. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the research report released by Soochow Securities, the relevant cited data are far from the actual data of Fucheng Shares. I am afraid that the source of the information and whether the data has been investigated and verified are all a mess. How can a research report like this deserve market credibility? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The so-called research reports are analysis reports prepared by financial institutions such as securities companies, fund companies, banks, etc. They mainly include company analysis reports, industry analysis reports, investment strategy reports, etc. The purpose of the research report is to help investors better understand the market, the company, and the industry so that they can be used as a reference when investing. However, the content is full of errors and omissions, pointing the research direction towards Feng Shui, or making gimmicks of comparing electric vehicles with main battle tanks, which reflects that some brokers do not pay attention to the professionalism of the research report, and even use the research report as a tool for speculation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The motivation behind securities firms’ “weird research reports” cannot simply be attributed to sensationalism. In financial markets, information release is a form of power to some extent. Therefore, regulatory authorities have corresponding standards for financial institutions, listed companies, and media to release various types of investment-oriented information. As professional information providers, brokerage research reports influence investors&#39; decisions to a considerable extent. However, in the process of pursuing so-called market influence, some securities companies make some shocking remarks to attract attention and attention. There will be traffic or profit considerations, and they may even interfere or distort market trends. Since brokerages are also one of the important stock holders in the stock market, if a brokerage publishes a research report that is &quot;bullish&quot; or &quot;short&quot; on a listed company or a certain sector in an exaggerated way, and secretly buys or sells the corresponding stocks, wouldn&#39;t it be typical? Manipulation of the stock market? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this regard, regulatory authorities have also promulgated relevant new management policies many times in recent years. In May last year, the regulatory authorities sent the &quot;Notice on the &quot;Double Random&quot; On-site Inspection of the Securities Research Report Business to all securities firms. The report shows that in 2022, a special &quot;double random&quot; on-site inspection of research and reporting business will be carried out in the entire industry, covering a total of 45 securities companies and 300 research reports. In September of that year, the China Securities Association reiterated the self-regulatory management of the securities research business of securities firms, including that holdings of more than 1% of the research target stocks must be disclosed and that reverse operations are not allowed within two trading days of the release of the research report; however, various management measures do not seem to hinder The continuation of &quot;Weird Research Reports&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This shows that for strange research reports, the regulatory authorities’ punishment and supervision need to be strengthened. Warning letters, inclusion in integrity files, etc. cannot touch the core interests of relevant personnel and securities companies, so that they would rather have short-term market effects than adhere to compliance. Only by clarifying the responsibilities of securities firms in the production and release of research reports and continuing to increase penalties for violations can the regulatory authorities stop the vicious cycle of &quot;bad coins eliminating good coins&quot; in securities firms&#39; research reports. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 19 Nov 2023 13:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[18亿元起拍，衡阳政务数据资源特许经营权转让为何暂停？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260897]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-19 12:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;This round of transfers in Hengyang is considered the &quot;first sale&quot; of government data and has attracted widespread attention.

Resources include information resources collected by various government departments directly or through third parties in accordance with the law, authorized and managed in accordance with the law, and information resources formed by relying on the government information system to perform their duties. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Encourage the open utilization of information under the conditions of ensuring data security, personal privacy and corporate commercial confidentiality.&quot; The management measures state that it is necessary to promote the registration and confirmation of open data, value assessment and other work, and actively explore the data market operations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The management measures state that public data that involves national security, business secrets and personal privacy, or that is not allowed to be opened in accordance with laws, regulations and other regulations, are parts that are not allowed to be opened. Any leakage of state secrets, work secrets, business secrets and personal privacy will be dealt with in accordance with the National Secrets Law and relevant regulations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In June 2023, Guizhou issued a document requiring that big data authorities at all levels authorize qualified market entities to operate government data at the same level and develop data that does not involve state secrets, commercial secrets, or personal privacy. Data services and products and trade through Guiyang Big Data Exchange. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The above-mentioned management measures of Hengyang state that the data rights belong to the government, and Hengyang Development Investment Group Co., Ltd. is authorized to develop and operate it through a franchise. According to the Enterprise Alert, the company is the largest urban investment platform in Hengyang, with assets exceeding 140 billion yuan, and is 100% owned by the Hengyang Municipal State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the Hengyang Municipal Party Committee and Municipal Government believe that the government data operation effect of Hengyang Development Investment Group needs to be improved. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On July 27, 2023, the official website of the Hengyang Municipal Commission for Discipline Inspection and Supervision released the &quot;Notice on the Progress of Inspection and Rectification by the Committee of the Communist Party of China Hengyang Development Investment Group Co., Ltd.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The second issue reported is &quot;Ineffective implementation of the decisions and arrangements of the municipal party committee and municipal government.&quot; In this regard, the rectification situation reads, &quot;Accelerate the injection of some asset resources that have been expressly determined by the municipal party committee and government...

It is disclosed in the transaction attachment that the starting price is the appraisal price of the target, but the columns for the appraisal agency and the appraisal base date are both blank. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Why did the project evaluation price reach 1.8 billion yuan? Staff from the Hengyang Administrative Approval Service Bureau did not respond. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Currently, the pricing of data resources is an industry problem. In February 2023, Zhao Jingwu, associate professor at Beihang University School of Law, wrote an article stating that data valuation indicators are not unified and data quality standards are difficult to determine. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He believes that even in general data trading activities, the so-called market pricing is just the result of self-negotiation between the parties to the transaction. This &quot;one thing, one discussion&quot; data valuation model is difficult to achieve for digital purposes. The market provides sufficient reference basis. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Government data faces the same problem. On November 16, at the main forum of the 2023 China Data Element Industry Innovation Conference, Wang Jiandong, deputy director of the Price Monitoring Center of the National Development and Reform Commission, said, “Before the end of this year or early next year, management measures for government-guided pricing of public data may be introduced. ”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The official website of Hengyang Public Resources Trading Center shows that the return mechanism of the government data resource franchise project is “user pays”. During the franchise period, the franchisee can charge fees from users within the scope of the franchise in return for project construction. However, the official website did not announce the specific number of years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One interviewee’s company is responsible for building a government data platform for a southern province. He explained to Southern Weekend reporters that users who will pay mainly refer to enterprises in various places that have information business needs, rather than individuals. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Prior to this, Hangzhou, Qingdao and other places have also tried to authorize operations for public data. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In September 2023, Hangzhou released the &quot;Public Data Authorized Operation Implementation Plan (Trial)&quot;. The document states that the next step is to determine the operating entity of the authorized operation platform, and with the consent of the municipal government, will be specifically responsible for the construction and operation, data management, operation and maintenance, and security of the authorized operation platform. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hangzhou’s plan states that priority will be given to supporting the development of public data authorization operations in the fields of credit, transportation, medical care, health, employment, social security, education, technology, finance, enterprise registration and supervision, housing construction, provident funds, and public security. , led by the competent departments in the field.

He was tall and thin, wearing a fitted black casual suit and a trousers. He was wearing trousers and holding a red paper bag in his hand, which contained three volumes of &quot;Governing the Country by Law and Criminal Procedure - Collected Works of Bian Jianlin&#39;s Legal Studies&quot;. For his 70th birthday this month, the publisher specially planned this collection of essays. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In 1979, eight years after graduating from high school, Bian Jianlin left his hometown in Jiangsu and entered Beijing Political Science and Law School, which had just resumed school after the Cultural Revolution. College, which is now China University of Political Science and Law. Relying on employee scholarships provided by the state, Bian Jianlin completed his bachelor&#39;s and master&#39;s degrees. Just before life was about to reach another fork in the road, &quot;a major event happened.&quot; In 1986, the third batch of law doctoral programs in the country was confirmed, and two law professors from China University of Political Science and Law were appointed as doctoral supervisors. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In 1987, Bian Jianlin studied under Professor Chen Guangzhong, who is recognized as the &quot;founder of criminal procedure law&quot; in China. Four years later, he became the first doctoral student in criminal procedural law independently trained by the People&#39;s Republic of China, and embarked on a career development path similar to that of his mentor. To date, Bian Jianlin has trained 87 doctors and 11 postdoctoral fellows. He also serves as the honorary dean of the Procedural Law Institute of China University of Political Science and Law, the executive director and academic committee member of the China Law Society, and the honorary president of the China Criminal Procedural Law Research Association. He works as a professor at Jilin University, Wuhan University, Zhongnan University of Economics and Law, East China University of Political Science and Law, Northwest University of Political Science and Law, People&#39;s Public Security University of China, and National Prosecutor&#39;s College.

This collection of essays has a profound impact on my academic work. It means life summary, so I said a few words in the preface. I was admitted early at the University of Political Science and Law, and was in the first class after the school was re-established. However, compared with other scholars who entered earlier, I was still relatively older when I entered. Fortunately, I completed my bachelor&#39;s degree, master&#39;s degree and Ph.D. in one go, so I gained some time back. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>; What were you doing before you were admitted to the Beijing University of Political Science and Law in 1979? How did you think of studying law? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Bian Jianlin:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;After graduating from high school in 1971, I went to work in a provincial factory. Later, the college entrance examination was resumed, but after all, it was not a required option. Very few of my high school classmates went on to college. At that time, everyone had a job and even got married and had children. But I still have a little bit of ambition, and I have such an ambition to take the exam. As for studying law, it is almost an inevitable choice. First of all, during the ten years of turmoil, our generation was wasted. Basically, we did not learn mathematics, physics and chemistry, and we were seriously partial to subjects. It was not easy to take the science and engineering exams, so we had to choose from liberal arts. Foreign languages, Chinese, history and law, among which law is definitely the most attractive. The main reason is that many of the books I read in the past were about solving crimes, about identifying doubts and clearing grievances, punishing evil and eradicating evil, and upholding justice, so I naturally developed a legal feeling. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>; Why study Criminal Procedure Law? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Bian Jianlin:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;When I was an undergraduate, the school had only one law major, and there was no further subdivision. major. When I was about to graduate, I decided to take the postgraduate entrance examination. According to my personality and interests, I didn’t really like civil law. What I liked most was the “study of criminal justice”, so my major choice should be criminal law. However, there is a certain degree of chance in choosing criminal procedure law. The school&#39;s master&#39;s entrance exams for Criminal Procedure Law and Criminal Law only differed in one subject, Criminal Procedure Archeology Chinese, while Criminal Law was the history of the legal system. In the year of the postgraduate entrance examination, I went home to celebrate the Spring Festival. After the Spring Festival, I had to take the exam. I thought that I would have to work hard to prepare for the legal history course, and there is always some basic knowledge in ancient Chinese, so it was just a matter of thought. The choice of exam subjects suddenly determined the direction of my major, so it was not that I realized the procedure from that time on. value and importance, because in fact substantive law was still ranked ahead of procedural law at that time. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>; Law is a practical subject. During your studies, didn’t you ever think about getting into practice? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Bian Jianlin:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;To learn the law, you must use it. Logically speaking, you have to work in the practical department , plus I was relatively old when I entered school. At that time, a bachelor&#39;s degree was enough, and I also studied for a master&#39;s degree. So I faced two choices at the time. One was to follow my family&#39;s wishes and return to Jiangsu. The Provincial High School wanted to recruit a Mature judges are more interested in me; if they stay in Beijing, they want to go to the Interpol China National Central Bureau through an old leader of the Ministry of Public Security. I did have some thoughts, but in the end both options were given up, and they were not implemented to the extent of signing a contract. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>; Why gave up? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Bian Jianlin:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;In 1986, before I graduated with my master’s degree, the school was approved for two doctoral programs, including Two teachers were identified as doctoral supervisors, namely Professor Wang Xuan and Professor Chen Guangzhong. Teacher Chen is responsible for the litigation law major. They are also the first batch of doctoral supervisors at China University of Political Science and Law. After receiving the PhD approval, Teacher Chen once talked to me. First, he told me that I had the opportunity to continue my studies; second, he expressed his affirmation to me. After Teacher Chen chatted with me, I was more tempted, although I didn’t fully appreciate the school’s advantages at the time. The most important thing is that my nature is that I am always uneasy about the status quo and have an upward spirit. I have never thought of being rich and settling down. In this way, I decided to continue studying for a Ph.D. after graduating with a master’s degree. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>; You obtained your master&#39;s degree in 1986 and your doctoral program was approved in the same year. How come it was only a year later that you started studying for your Ph.D.? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Bian Jianlin:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I started preparing for the Ph.D. exam before and after I graduated with my master’s degree. However, although the doctoral program was approved at that time, there were insufficient preparations for public announcements and enrollment listings. Due to various reasons, neither doctoral program enrolled students that year. However, Teacher Chen happened to be the deputy dean of the Graduate School at the time, and the school established a new research institution, the Chinese Legal Research Institute, with Teacher Chen also serving as the director. So I stayed in school and worked at the China Legal Research Institute, doing full-time research, doing projects, and writing articles. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>; How many doctoral students studied with you under Professor Chen? Why were you the first doctoral student to graduate? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Bian Jianlin:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Frankly speaking, in the first year of enrollment, the instructor has candidates in mind , but you still have to follow the formal process when applying. At that time, unlike now, the papers were basically judged on the spot after the exam, and the results were known quickly. Finally, Teacher Chen recruited me, and also recruited someone from our school. He was a master&#39;s student in criminal law in 1984, just one class after me. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Speaking of this, it is also a coincidence. If the school had recruited doctors in 1986, he had not graduated with a master&#39;s degree at that time, and we would not be classmates. . However, although we are both in the first batch of doctoral students, he is a full-time student, while I am a part-time PhD student because I have already stayed in school to work. According to the country&#39;s degree regulations at that time, those studying for a PhD on the job would have to study longer than those studying full-time. As for how long, there is no clear regulation. So I extended my studies by one year and graduated in 4 years. If calculated according to this time, it is possible that he graduated before me, then I will not become the first doctorate in criminal procedural law. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;But the students in the same class later went to study in the United States and never came back, leaving me alone to hold on. Later, I joked that if he didn&#39;t leave, he would definitely graduate before me, and the title of the first doctor of litigation law would belong to him. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;&quot;Follow the teacher&#39;s steps&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekends:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;The first batch of 18 Ph.D.s was produced in 1983, but the first recipient of a doctorate in law was graduated in 1987. Among all disciplines, law is not a niche, and it is not too early to cultivate a doctorate in law. What do you think?&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Bian Jianlin:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I think the reason for getting a doctorate in law is a little later. First, the doctoral program was of high value at that time. At that time, the approval of the doctoral program and the determination of the doctoral supervisor required the approval of the Academic Degrees Committee of the State Council, which was very strictly controlled. The second reason is that from the perspective of faculty and research level, law was still a discipline with relatively scarce talents and did not have the conditions to train doctoral students. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>; In 1988, Professor Chen Guangzhong edited the book &quot;Comparative Research on Foreign Criminal Proceedings&quot;. Three years later, your doctoral thesis &quot;Comparative Research on Criminal Prosecution Systems&quot; was approved. From a professional research perspective, did Professor Chen have a great influence on you? big? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Bian Jianlin:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Teacher Chen has always attached great importance to understanding and learning from foreign litigation systems. When we were still studying for master&#39;s degrees, there was a very lack of teaching materials. Basically, each school compiled and printed its own teaching materials. It happened that when Mr. Chen was the deputy dean of graduate students, he brought a topic from the Institute of Law of the Academy of Social Sciences on foreign criminal litigation. A comparative study of procedures. At that time, reform and opening up had already begun, and we were encouraged to study China&#39;s issues from a global perspective. Based on a group of experts from the Law Institute, Teacher Chen recruited some scholars from our school and other schools who studied this field to work together on this work. . Several of our classmates who are still studying for master&#39;s degrees also participated in part of it. I participated in writing a chapter, that is, compulsory medical measures, but I did not sign my name separately. I completed it under the guidance of my supervisor. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;At that time, this book was the first domestic comparative and systematic study of foreign criminal procedure. It was both authoritative and precious. If you want to know more about it, If you know something about it abroad, you must read this book. For those of us who participated in writing this book, because writing required research on foreign materials, only the University of Political Science and Law had this condition at the time, so it was the first step for me to broaden my academic horizons. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;In the previous In an article, you called Professor Chen &quot;the leading figure in criminal procedure law in New China.&quot; Do you have any observations about his academic studies and his conduct as a person? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Bian Jianlin:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Teacher Chen is a recognized master and an important founder and leader of our discipline. people. I feel that my husband&#39;s biggest specialty in learning is to learn from the best of other schools, to be open to all rivers, and to be tolerant, so later on he suddenly surpassed other teachers of his generation and was beyond the reach of others; the second is to know people and make good use of them, and make full use of their talents. Every time he writes something or works on a project, he can always hand over the relevant content to the most suitable person; the third thing is to be able to pay attention to and accept new things, and constantly improve himself by guiding students. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In addition to learning, the teacher also has a strong sense of responsibility and mission. He cares about current affairs and is now 93 years old. He is still paying attention to social phenomena and judicial practice. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Professor Chen’s Do personal traits influence you? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Bian Jianlin:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Mr. Chen has had a great influence on me. Over the years, I can say that I have been closely related to him. He followed suit every step of the way. In addition to the master-disciple relationship, my position also determines why my behavior, knowledge and knowledge are closer to those of my husband. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>; You and Professor Chen have been promoting the localization and application of some overseas experiences. In this process, what impact has reform and opening up had? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Bian Jianlin:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Mr. Chen is an iconic figure in the field of criminal procedure law in my country. The development and improvement of the criminal procedure system can be said to have made a great contribution and deserved the most credit. In terms of participation in legislation, when the Criminal Procedure Law was formulated in 1979, there were relatively few scholars involved. Mr. Chen was still in Guangxi at that time. I feel that this was his regret. The revision of the Criminal Procedure Law in 1996 was an opportunity to make amends, and Mr. Chen played a great role in the revision of the law. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;I still remember that in the winter of 1992, after Mr. Chen became the president of China University of Political Science and Law, his first symposium was held at the school. In the now demolished international student building, the director of the Criminal Law Office of the Legal Affairs Committee of the Standing Committee of the National People&#39;s Congress came with the director. At that time, the law was being revised. In 1993, because I assisted Mr. Chen in promoting the first revision of the Criminal Procedure Law, I was sent to study at New York University as a core member of the research team. Later, I participated in an inspection delegation led by Mr. Chen to several European countries. The director of the Criminal Law Office of the Legal Affairs Commission also participated in the inspection. After returning to China, the Legal Affairs Committee formally sent a letter to the school, entrusting Mr. Chen to lead a research team to provide opinions on the revision of the law. A year later, Mr. Chen’s research team submitted a 350,000-word “Recommendation Draft for the Criminal Procedure Law of the People’s Republic of China” to the Legal Affairs Commission, of which 65% of the provisions were absorbed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In addition to domestic projects, I assisted Mr. Chen in conducting some international exchanges and cooperation and conducting some comparative law research. For example, it selects students to study abroad, translates and publishes the criminal procedure codes of some representative countries, promotes the implementation of international human rights conventions and United Nations criminal justice guidelines in China, etc. It should be said that it has done a lot of useful things to promote the development and improvement of my country&#39;s criminal procedure system, and also promoted the discipline construction and talent cultivation of procedural law at China University of Political Science and Law. These were unique to the University of Political Science and Law at that time. Other schools neither had this team strength nor the necessary conditions and capabilities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Amending the Constitution in 2004 At that time, Professor Chen proposed that &quot;the state respects and protects human rights&quot; be written into the Constitution; in 2012, when the Criminal Procedure Law was revised for the second time, this article was written into the Criminal Procedure Law. As his student, you have always advocated that criminal procedure law should protect individual rights. Why have you been so concerned about this issue? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Bian Jianlin:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Human rights protection is very closely related to criminal proceedings. Criminal procedure law is a typical field where public power operates and an important tool for national governance. For a long time, influenced by concepts, systems and even ideologies, we have regarded criminal proceedings as a contest between the state and crime, emphasizing the punishment of crimes, resulting in the lack of effective restrictions on the power of specialized state agencies in litigation activities. Correspondingly, the rights and interests of criminal suspects, defendants and other litigation participants cannot be fully protected. From the perspective of social development trends, the country&#39;s comprehensive promotion of governing the country according to law and building a country ruled by law means regulating public power through the rule of law and procedures to prevent power from being alienated and abused. Mr. Chen has a full understanding of this and has done a lot of work , through their own efforts to strengthen human rights protection in the judiciary, influence legislation, and improve the judiciary. Under the leadership of Mr. Chen, we have also made our own efforts and contributions to this end. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;&quot;It is not enough to do it yourself&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left; &quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;In a previous school lecture, you and the students discussed the vindication of unjust, false and wrongful convictions. Judging from past news reports, lawyers representing many cases are known as &quot;hard-nosed lawyers&quot;. What do you think of this group? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Bian Jianlin:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;The defense system and the lawyer profession reflect the level of the rule of law in a country. If the level of lawyers in a country is very weak and the defense system is not perfect, it is impossible to progress in criminal litigation. When the Criminal Procedure Law was formulated in 1979, there were basically no lawyers. Interim Regulations on Lawyers were only introduced in 1980. Therefore, the legislative provisions on lawyer defense are relatively backward. However, several revisions to the Criminal Procedure Law since 1996 have improved the lawyer defense system. Overall, the progress of the defense system is obvious to all. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;But at the same time, it should be noted that there are still many problems in the legal provisions regarding lawyer defense, especially in judicial practice. I think one of the important reasons is that we have not found an accurate positioning of the lawyer profession and lawyer defense. In criminal proceedings, the defense lawyer&#39;s duty is to defend the defendant, find faults and discover problems from various angles such as facts, evidence, legal application, procedural operation, etc., so as to promote the fair handling of the case and thereby improve the level of the rule of law. By nature, lawyers do not exercise public power and are not members of the case-handling agency. Our management of lawyers is different. Lawyers are managed by judicial administrative agencies, which are part of the specialized state agencies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In judicial practice, in order to provide effective defense, to protect the legitimate rights and interests of the parties, or to ensure that legal procedures are complied with, lawyers need to be more truthful when performing their defense duties. Sometimes there are conflicts with the case-handling agencies, so some lawyers are called &quot;die-hard lawyers.&quot; But if they are not serious and fight to the death, they will not be able to protect the interests of the parties involved, and they will not be able to carry out defense work normally. Recently, some extreme examples have occurred, such as a court in Laibin, Guangxi, which forced lawyers to undergo security checks, made things difficult for them, and violated their legitimate rights and interests. This had a very bad impact, which attracted the attention of people across the country and was named by the Supreme Court. I think after such an extreme thing happens, the entire court system should take a warning. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Seems like this contradiction This is found in many of our legal systems. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Bian Jianlin: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;It is not enough to do it yourself. It does take time for the law on paper to become law in action, and various problems will arise during the implementation process. In a certain sense, many of the problems or difficulties faced in my country&#39;s current judicial practice are caused by the development of the system. Some things that seem good are actually very difficult to do. It may touch the interests of some people and even intensify conflicts. I believe that problems in development must still be solved by development. On the one hand, we must know more about the situation and pay attention to practice when designing the system; on the other hand, once the law is revised, the authority of the law must be maintained, and the case-handling agencies must strictly enforce the law. Take the lead in abiding by the law and earnestly abide by the procedures prescribed by law. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>; In the past, everyone said that law is a humanities and social science, but now it is said that law is an engineering discipline within the humanities and social sciences. What do you think of this view? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Bian Jianlin:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;There is no doubt that law is a humanities and social science, at least a discipline, or It is science, and it does have some attributes of engineering. Especially our discipline is very applicable and operable. When we studied in the past, we studied &quot;Criminal Procedure Law&quot;, but now it is called &quot;Criminal Procedure Law&quot;. The addition of the word &quot;study&quot; actually means that we realize that this is a science and a knowledge system. It is not just about interpreting the meaning of the law, but also using it to govern society and achieve good results. Taking the ascertainment of case facts as an example, it is not only an epistemological issue, but also involves axiology and methodology. Due procedures must be used to regulate the exercise of power by the case-handling agencies. Generally speaking, procedural law is an operational norm. It must have a specific set of principles, rules, methods, procedures and institutional norms, and it must be meticulous and operable, so that litigation activities can be followed by law. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>; With more than 40 years of study and academic experience, do you have any experience that you can share with young students? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Bian Jianlin:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Whether I am a scholar or a teacher, I actually learned from Mr. Chen , he set an example for us, teaching us to be patriotic and caring for the people, to have an open vision, and to have a spirit of research. This is what I strive to follow when doing academic work. In addition, I often remind students to care about current affairs and pay attention to the present. Many things happen around us every day, or there are examples closely related to our profession every day. Don&#39;t turn a deaf ear or be indifferent. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;As for how to learn and how to write articles, this is indeed not an easy task. I think that first of all, individuals need to work hard, and at the same time, they also need opportunities. When we were studying, we should say that there were more opportunities. There was a shortage of people in front of us because of the passing of generations, and the society was in urgent need of talents, so that we would be the first in this and the first in that way. Nowadays, law has become a prominent school. Young people are under great pressure, but there are not many opportunities. Then they need to be more diligent, redouble their efforts, be calm, endure loneliness, and never let go of their youth. If they really learn, they will achieve something. There are times when you can use force and give appropriate rewards. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 19 Nov 2023 11:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[《等待戈多》作者最喜欢的戏剧来中国，观众看得很精神]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260887]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-19 10:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;A black box stood on the stage. &quot;Endgame&quot; had not officially started, but the two characters were already inside. Extremely similar clips are repeated over and over again, as if the stage has turned into a machine that plays on a loop due to malfunction. The servant Clover wrung his fingers and walked the same route repeatedly with a strange gait. He stepped back from the door to the right of Master Ham&#39;s wheelchair, walked to the corner on the left, and then to the door on the right, taking fourteen precise steps, every time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The dialogue has not changed either. &quot;Do you want me to leave you?&quot; &quot;Of course.&quot; &quot;Then I will leave you.&quot; &quot;You can&#39;t leave me.&quot; &quot;Then I won&#39;t leave you.&quot; The door was opened and closed again and again. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1953, &quot;Waiting for Godot&quot; brought Beckett worldwide fame, but his favorite work was &quot;Endgame&quot; written four years later. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/18/9nCi5R8eQ6GQ8MC2uGTpV2Pz4rT7J40RVwMq7Zrj.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/18/9nCi5R8eQ6GQ8MC2uGTpV2Pz4rT7J40RVwMq7Zrj.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;258749&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Beckett&#39;s play &quot;Endgame&quot; will be performed at the 10th Wuzhen International Theater Festival in 2023. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of the organizer)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This play shows four deformed people in an empty house that is approaching the end of the world. : The master Ham is paralyzed from the lower body, blind, and has been sitting in a wheelchair; the servant Clover has a disease in his knees and cannot sit down. Ham&#39;s parents, Nag and Nell, have lost their lower limbs and live in two trash cans. The relationships between masters and servants, husbands and wives, and parents and children all show an extremely cruel side, but they are interdependent and inseparable. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the impression of Tobias Bianconi, Director General of the International Theater Association, in the past, the audience&#39;s reaction to Beckett and even absurdist plays was sometimes &quot;very frustrating and unhappy&quot;, but After he walked out of the theater, he found that after watching this version of the Vienna Volkstheater&#39;s performance, the Chinese audience was full of energy and had lively discussions. They all felt that the play was very fresh. &quot;Why is there such a reaction? What is the background that makes the audience like this play so much?&quot; he was curious. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the 20th century, which experienced the ravages of two world wars and was immersed in industrialization and the post-industrial era, the rationalism admired by Western civilization fell into crisis, belief in God collapsed, and self-doubt and self-denial became the themes of the times. This also brought profound conceptual changes to drama. What Beckett&#39;s drama expresses is the antagonistic relationship between human beings and nature, society, self and others who are completely alienated in social crisis. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Absurd drama, which was born in Paris, France, in the early 1950s, was echoed again in Wuzhen, China, seventy years later. &quot;At the beginning, we thought the most exciting thing was this very unhealthy and toxic relationship. Later we discovered that it had some parts related to war. As it slowly developed, we found that it might be related to climate change. Recently, We found that it was combined with the COVID-19 epidemic.&quot; During the dialogue, theater director and German director Kai Vogels said that this version of &quot;Endgame&quot; has been performed for eleven years. &quot;The point of it being constantly performed is that it is always new. , what we see from this drama keeps changing.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/18 /yJd8u4hbNeQQHztSBQk6L0OvaD60hZLYPPyafubF.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/18/yJd8u4hbNeQQHztSBQk6L0OvaD60hZLYPPyafubF.j pg&quot; data -key=&quot;258748&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Beckett&#39;s play &quot;Endgame&quot; was written in the late 1950s. The version that came to China has already been sold in Europe Acted for eleven years. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of the organizer)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Vogels refined the four characters into two clown-like people, retaining the main theme A very tense contrast between servants: Ham is physically disabled, but has the power to control Clover; Clough is relatively able to move freely, but is always dominated by his master to do unnecessary trivial things, and his spirit tends to be paralyzed. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The most eye-catching adaptation is Vogels’ emphasis on the sense of looping. The line, which was on an infinite loop before the show even started, only appeared once in the original script. Vogels uses this as the opening or closing line of every dialogue, repeating it a dozen times throughout the play. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A new plot in the play brings an &quot;anti-climax&quot;: after Clover struggled, he shot Hamm, but the expected relief brought by death did not happen. After the monologue, Ham suddenly answered and got up from the ground, as if nothing had happened. Clover and he returned to their usual endless conversation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Beckett actually demonstrated a ritual cycle on the stage. The ending of this ritual cycle is satisfaction, nothingness, or the end of the world. Everyone can see it differently. Each point has its own interpretation, and what I present on the stage also has this meaning.&quot; At the beginning of the rehearsal, Vogels hoped to show the inextricable cycle of repetition on the stage without making the audience feel bored. This balance Feeling is what he is looking for. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since 1998 Vogels has been a theater and opera director in Austria and Germany. German theater is relatively lagging behind in digital innovation. From 2010 to 2020, while serving as the artistic director of the Dortmund Theater in Germany, Vogels began to try to combine digital media with theater and introduce digital thinking to the theater stage. He is a pioneer. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among these works, digital techniques such as VR, real-time imaging, and on-site editing are emerging in endlessly. &quot;Endgame&quot; pursues Beckett&#39;s minimalist style. However, the artificially isolated cramped space, heavy metal-style amplified sound effects, The sudden switching of dazzling lights, the characters&#39; mechanically looping movements and lines, all give this picture of the human spiritual wasteland a cold science fiction color. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The more traditional images such as &quot;desert&quot; and &quot;dead branches&quot; in Beckett&#39;s original work are missing. In terms of stage design, the play chose a form that abstracted away from reality. Like the door, the few sets and props are all outlined with white chalk lines. Three-dimensional life seems to be locked in two-dimensional space. Machine guns and toy dogs are just thin wooden boards hanging on the wall when they are not picked out by actors and held in their hands. The clock has no hands and the flowers in the vase are out of proportion. The only two real objects are the wooden chair with armrests in the center of the stage and the light bulb hanging in the air. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The actors&#39; performances are consistent with German precision, and they achieve the ultimate in repetitive movements with slight changes. The actor who played Ham sat in a chair with his eyes closed throughout the performance, but still showed a strong sense of dominance and oppression in the relationship through his tone and gestures. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The voice can be called the third &quot;starring&quot; of this drama, expanding the information and emotional density in the minimalist world. Clough&#39;s footsteps continued to echo in the space, powerful, but as flat as the scenery, with no specific sense of direction. Footsteps create a strong conflict with directionlessness. Every time Clover dropped something he was holding, there was a loud cracking sound, whether it was a telescope, a machine gun, or a toy dog. The laws of the physical world break down here. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The two people, who are both master and servant and father and son, are imprisoned in a lifeless atmosphere. The room they were in was, in a sense, like the final game board in a chess game. Ham is the general on the chessboard and needs to ensure that he is in the &quot;center&quot; of the room, controlling his pieces. The little soldier Clover could barely move a few steps, but under the command of blind Ham, the situation was certain to lose, but they could not and did not dare to leave the room, just like the chess pieces could not leave the chessboard. &quot;There is no nature anymore&quot; outside the house. Even when I opened the window, I saw &quot;ZERO&quot; written on the blackboard. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;They passed the time by teasing, controlling, and torturing each other, telling the old stories again, and looking at the window that they had looked at countless times, hoping that something would happen. What happened in front of my eyes was that other people passed by the window. However, their expectations were all in vain, and all their actions no longer made much sense. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the end of the play, I realized that the beginning was the end. &quot;What time is it?&quot; &quot;Same as usual.&quot; They repeated the dialogue at the opening. Everything stopped suddenly, leaving silence and darkness. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 19 Nov 2023 10:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[冒充专家行医十年，靠秘方自制抗癌药：无证“神医”的罪与罚]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260877]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-19 08:59:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot;Miracle Doctor&quot; sells a bunch of titles to patients.

Nongjian Illustration&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Qingdao’s “old Chinese medicine doctor” Hou Yuanxiang, who pretended to be an expert and professor and practiced medicine illegally for more than ten years, fell for his homemade “anti-cancer drug” - in February 2023, Hou Yuanxiang was arrested by Qingdao at first instance The Huangdao District People&#39;s Court of the city sentenced him to 12 years in prison and fined him 12 million yuan for &quot;producing and selling counterfeit drugs.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Like Hou Yuanxiang, his daughter, son, wife and former son-in-law were also sentenced for &quot;producing and selling counterfeit drugs&quot; and were sentenced to prison terms ranging from 11 to 3 years respectively. In addition, the son of Hou Yuanxiang&#39;s third sister was also involved in the case. He was sentenced to 11 years in prison for &quot;fraud&quot; and &quot;harboring&quot; in the first instance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The total prison term for the above six people is 50 years, and the total fine is 29.8 million yuan. Southern Weekend reporters searched online for judgment documents and found that among counterfeit drug cases in recent years, the first-instance verdict in Hou Yuanxiang&#39;s case was extremely rare in terms of heavy sentencing and high fines. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the case has not yet been settled. After the first-instance verdict, as Hou Yuanxiang and others filed an appeal, many self-media appeared on the Internet to &quot;cry out injustice&quot; for them. Some associated the case with the &quot;folk traditional Chinese medicine&quot; group, believing that &quot;if this lawsuit is lost, almost all folk Chinese medicine practitioners must close their doors.&quot; (For details, please see the report &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.infzm.com/content/260879&quot;>;&quot;The Online Public Opinion War on the &quot;Miracle Cancer Doctor&quot;&lt;/a>;)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hou Yuanxiang&#39;s agent The lawyer questioned the characterization of the drugs involved in the case, arguing that after the revision of the Drug Administration Law in 2019, the threshold for identification of counterfeit drugs has been raised. Hou Yuanxiang’s self-made medicine is made of traditional Chinese medicinal materials and should not be identified as counterfeit drugs. Hou Yuanxiang does not constitute “production.” , the crime of selling counterfeit medicines.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On August 30, 2023, the Qingdao Intermediate People’s Court ruled to revoke the original judgment and remand the case for retrial on the grounds that the first-instance judgment “had unclear facts and insufficient evidence.” &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The &quot;old Chinese doctor&quot; who can&#39;t take the pulse&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;After being criminally detained on February 17, 2022, Hou Yuanxiang only stayed in the detention center for more than 20 days. After that, the police changed the enforcement measures to &quot;residential surveillance&quot; because of his illness. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Gang, the second-instance attorney, met Hou Yuanxiang after the National Day in 2023. According to him, two policemen worked in three shifts, watching him 24 hours a day, &quot;maybe because there are more patients coming to him.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the first-instance verdict, 66-year-old Hou Yuanxiang is from Shandong A native of Yishui County, Linyi City, the province, he once worked as a teacher in the county, but later took a leave of absence without pay and became a doctor. After that, he moved his family to Weifang and settled down. Around 2019, after purchasing real estate in Qingdao, Hou Yuanxiang and his wife and their daughter Hou Jing and his wife both moved their household registrations to Qingdao. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hou Yuanxiang’s confession cited in the first-instance verdict did not explain his medical experience. Some self-media said that Hou Yuanxiang studied under two &quot;famous Chinese medicine doctors&quot; Zhang Moumou and Lou Moumou, but Southern Weekend reporters did not find any information about the latter two as &quot;famous Chinese medicine doctors&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, it is certain that Hou Yuanxiang is not from a &quot;family of traditional Chinese medicine&quot; or &quot;six generations practicing medicine&quot; as some self-media said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to what Hou Yuanxiang’s wife and sister told China News Weekly, Hou Yuanxiang was originally a primary school teacher and started studying medicine when he was about 40 years old. He had “several teachers” but “all of them are gone.” This relative emphasized that Hou Yuanxiang was &quot;excellent&quot; in taking his pulse - he could tell whether it was cancer or what kind of cancer it was by just touching it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As a daughter-in-law, Li Jianying told Southern Weekend reporters that she did not know how Hou Yuanxiang learned Chinese medicine. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Most patients call Hou Yuanxiang &quot;Professor Hou&quot;, and Hou Yuanxiang&#39;s WeChat signature is also &quot;Professor Hou&quot;. The &quot;Central Health&quot; website, which claims to provide communication, display, and promotion services for &quot;folk doctors,&quot; still has Hou Yuanxiang&#39;s personal introduction, calling him an &quot;international doctor of medicine&quot; and &quot;an authoritative international cancer expert.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, according to Hou Yuanxiang’s confession, his online profiles, including “Professor of Chinese Medical College” and “Doctor of International Medicine”, “are all false” and “are intended to expand influence and make patients believe I&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, Hou Yuanxiang did not even obtain a medical practicing certificate. Since the implementation of the Practicing Physician Law in 1999, regardless of whether it is traditional Chinese medicine or Western medicine, all practitioners must have a physician&#39;s practice certificate. Otherwise, it will be regarded as &quot;illegal practice of medicine&quot;, and they will be subject to administrative penalties in the lightest case and criminal liability in the worst case. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A patient surnamed Xu testified that she began to seek medical treatment from Hou Yuanxiang in 2014. Since then, she has introduced many patients to Hou, and also asked Hou to attend a consultation at his winery. In 2019, she and Hou Yuanxiang co-organized When he went to the hospital, he found that Hou could not produce his medical license, so he doubted his identity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Not only patients, but also some senior medical professionals had no doubts about Hou Yuanxiang&#39;s identity and ability. According to the first-instance verdict, Hou Yuanxiang had been a doctor at Deyi Hall, a private traditional Chinese medicine hospital in Qingdao for a long time. Later, the person in charge of Deyi Hall asked Hou Yuanxiang to attach his medical qualification to the hospital. However, Hou Yuanxiang refused, and the two parties terminated the cooperation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the testimony of Shen Yufa, director of Zibo Yiyuan Ruikang Hospital, around 2010, he met Hou Yuanxiang at a medical academic conference in Beijing. “Many people attending the conference at that time said that Professor Hou was a doctor of traditional Chinese medicine. He is famous for tumors, cancer, and cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Later, Shen Yufa’s wife got cancer and took Hou Yuanxiang’s homemade medicine. Shen Yufa also hired Hou as a &quot;part-time professor&quot; at Ruikang Hospital and sold Hou&#39;s medicine at the hospital. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to Hou Yuanxiang’s confession, Shen Yufa once invited him to sit in Ruikang Hospital, but he refused because he did not have a medical license. The two parties only cooperated on selling medicines. However, Shen Yufa&#39;s son and another employee of the hospital confirmed that Hou Yuanxiang did not attend the hospital regularly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to private hospitals, Hou Yuanxiang has also worked with public hospitals. In 2016, Weifang Municipal Government Hospital, a public hospital, posted on its WeChat official account that Hou Yuanxiang was an &quot;authoritative expert in international cancer research&quot; and would conduct monthly consultations at the branch of traditional Chinese medicine. This article disappeared only recently. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Patients trust Hou Yuanxiang not only because of his impressive online resume, but also because of his “accurate” pulse numbering. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Dong Shijie is a relative of Hou Yuanxiang, a Jilin patient. According to him, Hou Yuanxiang once traveled to Changbai Mountain and hosted meals by himself. Hou Yuanxiang took his pulse on the spot. &quot;I have a friend who has high blood lipids and high blood pressure, and he can detect it,&quot; Dong Shijie told a reporter from Southern Weekend. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, according to the first-instance verdict, Hou Yuanxiang admitted to the investigators that he actually could not take a pulse. The reason for pretending to know the pulse is &quot;to put it bluntly, it is to let the patient buy medicine.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When he learned that Hou Yuanxiang could not check the pulse, Dong Shijie was shocked: &quot;He is a traditional Chinese medicine doctor. What kind of disease would he treat if he could not check the pulse?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;The whole family went into hiding&quot; after the incident&lt;/h4 >; &lt;p>;According to the first-instance judgment, since 2011, Hou Yuanxiang, Hou Jing and others, without obtaining a drug production license, a drug business license, etc., posted Hou Yuanxiang’s false personal profile on the Internet to spread information in many places in Shandong Consulting and selling drugs claiming to be anti-cancer. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Hou Yuanxiang’s counterfeit drug case, the first person to be involved was his daughter Hou Jing—like her father, she did not have a medical certificate. On January 16, 2022, after receiving complaints and reports, multiple departments in Huangdao District, Qingdao City jointly conducted law enforcement and captured Hou Jing on the spot. Later, Hou Jing confessed to Hou Yuanxiang, his brother Hou Lei and others. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the first-instance verdict, Hou Yuanxiang was at his home in Weifang at the time. He didn’t seem to care at first. It wasn’t until Hou Jing was detained and he was interrogated by the police that he realized the seriousness of the situation and transferred the self-made medicine to Qingdao Clinic overnight. and production tools, but it was too late. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The court of first instance found that after Hou Jing was detained, Hou Yuanxiang&#39;s wife went to the police station handling the case to inquire about information, and &quot;hidden the whole family&quot; after returning home for an excuse. The police then pursued the Hou family online. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to Hou Lei’s confession, Hou Yuanxiang called him the day after Hou Jing was arrested. &quot;Two or three days later, my father said that this was a serious matter and asked me not to use my current mobile phone and to go out and hide. After hanging up the phone, I took out the phone card and threw it in the trash.&quot;&lt;/p >; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;As for how Hou Lei participated in these businesses, Hou Lei said that in the winter of 2019, Hou Yuanxiang &quot;asked me to apply for a bank card in the name of my wife Li Jianying... and asked me to pretend Director Li of the hospital, if a patient wants to buy medicine, call me and ask me to give the patient a bank card so that the patient can transfer money.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to Hou Yuanxiang’s confession, Hou Jing and Hou Lei had a bad relationship. After Hou Lei knew that Hou Jing was making money, he also wanted to sell medicine with his father. He asked him for the formula many times, but Hou Yuanxiang did not give it. He just asked Hou Lei to follow him and pay him a salary. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Jianying told Southern Weekend reporters that Hou Lei helped Hou Yuanxiang deliver goods in Weifang, &quot;equivalent to a courier.&quot; In the first-instance verdict, Hou Lei was sentenced to &quot;producing and selling counterfeit drugs&quot; according to law, and was sentenced to 8 years in prison and fined 5 million yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to Hou Lei&#39;s confession, after hiding for a few days, he received a call from Hou Yuanxiang from an unknown number, suggesting that he go to the third aunt&#39;s house in Qingdao to celebrate the New Year, and then the whole family went to the third aunt&#39;s house. According to Hou Lei&#39;s confession, because he felt that &quot;the matter was quite serious&quot;, he once suggested that his father surrender. &quot;My father was very angry and said that I was not his biological child.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Shuai, the son of Hou Lei’s third aunt, told Hou Lei that he had the connections to settle the matter, but he would need 4 million yuan. After several communications, Hou Lei asked his ex-brother-in-law Fu Songjie to send 2 million yuan in cash to Li Shuai after he had already paid 500,000 yuan. Li Shuai confessed that when he saw Fu Songjie coming to the door with a sack of money, he was stunned: &quot;This is the first time I have seen so much money.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fu Songjie was originally from a district in Weifang City In 2019, he resigned and went to Qingdao at the request of his ex-wife Hou Jing. Before resigning, Hou Yuanxiang approached him and asked him to serve as the legal representative of a private hospital in which Hou was a shareholder. After Fu Songjie arrived in Qingdao, he caught up with the epidemic and had no job, so he helped his father-in-law and his ex-wife, and ended up becoming an accomplice. Fu Songjie was sentenced to 3 years in prison and fined 500,000 yuan in the first instance. The sentence was the shortest among all those involved in the case, and Fu was the only one who did not appeal. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After Hou Lei was arrested, he confessed Li Shuai. In the next three days, Li Shuai, Fu Songjie and Hou Yuanxiang were arrested one after another. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to Hou Yuanxiang, in addition to the above 2.5 million yuan, Li Shuai also defrauded him of more than 2 million yuan. The first-instance judgment confirmed the matter and stated that &quot;it will be separately investigated and handled by the public security organs.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the Hou Yuanxiang counterfeit drug case, the police seized a total of 8 houses in the Hou family. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In late February 2022, a week after Hou Yuanxiang was arrested, the Ministry of Public Security announced the first batch of eight major typical drug crime cases to be supervised, and Hou Yuanxiang’s fake drug case was among them. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;Secret Recipes&quot; of Unknown Origin&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In the Hou Yuanxiang case, the medicines that were classified as fake were four self-made medicines by Hou Yuanxiang and his daughter, two of which were named &quot; Anti-Cancer No. 1” and “Anti-Cancer No. 2”. According to Hou Yuanxiang&#39;s confession, these two medicines were made according to a &quot;secret recipe.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, Hou Yuanxiang has different opinions on the origin of this &quot;secret recipe&quot;. During the investigation stage of the case, he said that the secret recipe came from one of his &quot;second grandfathers.&quot; This recipe originally contained five kinds of medicine. On this basis, Hou Yuanxiang added shiitake mushrooms, ganoderma lucidum, and cordyceps. &quot;Even if this recipe is my own creation, I I have always wanted to promote this prescription and sell the medicine to make money.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, during the trial stage of the case, Hou Yuanxiang’s statement about the “secret recipe” changed—he claimed that the recipe was given to him by his “teacher” at the end of 2019. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hou Yuanxiang’s different statements about the source of the secret recipe puzzled a second-instance attorney: “Perhaps only he himself knows the truth.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The first-instance judgment quoted an attorney of the Hou family According to the lawyer, Hou Yuanxiang&#39;s anti-cancer &quot;secret recipe&quot; contains many Chinese medicinal materials such as shiitake mushrooms, cordyceps, Ganoderma lucidum, Prunella vulgaris, black dates, kelp, burdock root, dandelion root, ginseng, astragalus, angelica and so on. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A Chinese medicine practitioner who has been practicing for more than 40 years told Southern Weekend reporters that the Chinese medicinal materials in Hou Yuanxiang’s prescription include both “tonifying” and “attacking” ingredients, such as ginseng, Astragalus, when cancer patients reach the middle and late stages, most of them are relatively weak, so it is beneficial to use some tonics; &quot;attack&quot; medicines such as kelp, which has the effect of clearing away heat and dissipating stagnation, is only suitable for some early-stage cancer patients and is not suitable for late-stage cancer patients. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among Hou Yuanxiang’s patients, there are many terminal cancer patients, and some came to Hou Yuanxiang because they were “sentenced to death by the hospital.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Different from traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), which treats patients according to prescriptions, Hou Yuanxiang’s anti-cancer drugs are prepared in advance, bagged and then sold to patients. According to his confession, around November 2020, Hou Jing purchased a decoction-making machine online. Since then, the father and daughter have taken turns using this machine to make decoctions, &quot;and can make about 80 bags a day.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The price of &quot;Anti-cancer No. 1&quot; is 4,620 yuan per serving, and &quot;Anti-cancer No. 2&quot; is 1,920 yuan. One dose is taken for one course of treatment, and one course of treatment lasts for 12 days. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for Hou Yuanxiang’s homemade anti-cancer drugs, Zhao Yin, a lawyer who graduated from the University of Traditional Chinese Medicine and has worked in the clinical department of traditional Chinese medicine in the hospital for many years, believes that it is definitely illegal. According to her, Hou Yuanxiang&#39;s self-made medicines are similar to &quot;medical institution (TCM) preparations&quot; in hospitals, which refer to fixed prescription preparations prepared by medical institutions for their own use after approval based on the clinical needs of the unit. However, hospital preparations, like medicines, generally need to be approved by the drug regulatory department before they can be produced and sold. In principle, they can only be produced by the hospital for their own use and cannot be sold externally. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhao Yin said that after the promulgation of the Traditional Chinese Medicine Law in 2017, the state has relaxed its management of traditional Chinese medicine preparations. Traditional Chinese medicine preparations that only use traditional techniques do not need to obtain a preparation approval number and only need to apply for a preparation approval number. It can be prepared after registration with the provincial drug regulatory department. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, Hou Yuanxiang’s self-made medicine has also not been registered. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Traditional Chinese Medicine Law stipulates that medical institutions that prepare traditional Chinese medicine preparations that should be registered but fail to do so will be punished as producing counterfeit drugs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhao Yin also doubted whether Hou Yuanxiang’s homemade anti-cancer medicine really contained a sufficient amount of Chinese medicinal materials such as cordyceps claimed in the “secret recipe” because the medicine was made by Hou Yuanxiang and his daughter themselves and there was no formula. The production process standards lack proper supervision and supervision. However, quantitative detection of Cordyceps sinensis is very difficult. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to Fu Songjie’s confession, Hou Jing would send Liuwei Dihuang Pills and other Chinese patent medicines to patients together with the boiled Chinese medicine liquid. In Zhao Yin&#39;s view, in this way, even if the patient feels effective after taking the medicine, it may be the effect of the proprietary Chinese medicine. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to avoid the characterization of &quot;fake medicine&quot;, Hou Yuanxiang once tried to defend himself by claiming that &quot;medicine and food have the same origin&quot;, which means that what he sells is food. However, due to the labeling of drug names such as &quot;Anti-cancer No. 1&quot; and &quot;Anti-cancer No. 2&quot;, his defense is difficult to establish. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhao Yin believes that the drug names &quot;Anti-cancer No. 1&quot; and &quot;Anti-cancer No. 2&quot; are nondescript, because cancer is a concept of Western medicine, and traditional Chinese medicine generally does not have the term &quot;cancer&quot; or &quot;tumor&quot;. Instead, it is called &quot;accumulation of symptoms.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for Hou Yuanxiang’s practice of making homemade anti-cancer drugs, the above-mentioned traditional Chinese medicine doctors interviewed by Southern Weekend reporters called him “too courageous”. In his opinion, many Chinese medicine practitioners have secret recipes. In order not to reveal the secret recipes, they usually only sell the medicinal materials to patients. At most, they cook them for the patients. They certainly dare not make their own medicines and sell them to patients. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Have any cancer patients been cured?&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;However, supporters &quot;voted injustice&quot; against Hou Yuanxiang on the Internet because he cured many cancer patients. However, a Southern Weekend reporter&#39;s investigation found that it is questionable whether any cancer patients were actually cured by Hou Yuanxiang. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the first-instance verdict of the Hou Yuanxiang case, a list of cancer patients who claimed to be &quot;cured by Hou Yuanxiang&quot; leaked online. There were a total of 31 personal information of patients or patients&#39; family members on the list. This list is consistent with that provided to Southern Weekend reporters by Gong Feiyun, one of Hou Yuanxiang’s supporters. According to Gong Feiyun, at the end of June 2023, he went to Qingdao to meet Hou Yuanxiang, and it was Hou Yuanxiang himself who gave him this list. Gong Feiyun is a partner of a local traditional Chinese medicine clinic. A few years ago, he was involved in a controversy when self-made medicines were deemed to be counterfeit. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporters made all 31 calls on the list, of which 11 were not answered and 13 were refused. Of the 7 calls answered, 6 admitted that they were patients on the list or Family members, and another person denied that he was Che Moumou, the &quot;Director of the Provincial Environmental Protection Bureau&quot; written on the list, saying that he was &quot;running business.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among the 6 people, 3 people refused to be interviewed on the grounds of &quot;something happened&quot; and &quot;privacy involved&quot;, and only 3 people accepted the telephone interview. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The patient, Song Yuanjia, is from Qingdao, Shandong. He claimed that he was &quot;sentenced to death by the hospital.&quot; He approached Hou Yuanxiang with the mentality of giving it a try, and &quot;it was fine once he tried it.&quot; &quot;It has been 7 years now. Nothing&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Song Yuan’s family told Southern Weekend reporters that Hou Yuanxiang’s medicine was an “ancestral medicine” and he spent more than 200,000 yuan without giving a prescription, first taking “Anti-Cancer No. 1” and “in the end he became poor. Feel better, take &#39;Anti-Cancer No. 2&#39;&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the first-instance verdict, when Hou Yuanxiang moved his homemade medicine and production tools overnight, he asked the Song Yuan family for help, and the Song Yuan family found a warehouse for him to store the items Hou Yuanxiang moved. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Song Yuanjia told Southern Weekend reporters that he had read Hou Yuanxiang’s first-instance verdict, but he was more willing to believe the “crying out injustice” video on the self-media. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another interviewee, Wang Jingjiang, is a villager in a village in Zibo, Shandong, and the patient is his mother-in-law. He said that Hou Yuanxiang once planned to build a sanatorium in the village. He was driving for the village party secretary and got to know Hou. Later, his mother-in-law got cancer and there was no possibility of surgery. After undergoing chemotherapy for a period of time, he contacted &quot;Professor Hou&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Jingjiang said that Hou Yuanxiang&#39;s medicine was &quot;good&quot; and his mother-in-law felt &quot;strong&quot; after drinking it. However, she stopped drinking it because she couldn&#39;t stand the taste. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the opinion of lawyer Yang Fengzhu, one of the experts in drafting and demonstrating traditional Chinese medicine laws, Hou Yuanxiang’s “anti-cancer drugs” are several Chinese medicines mixed together. Although Chinese medicine treatments rarely have “immediate results”, they are not It has no effect. &quot;Once you take the (Chinese medicine) that replenishes qi, it will definitely have an effect.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Jingjiang also emphasized that his mother-in-law was not &quot;cured&quot;, but &quot;has not (re) committed the crime or been transferred.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The third interviewee, Li Cheng (pseudonym), is from Yanbian, Jilin. He told Southern Weekend reporters that the patient was his grandfather, and he had indeed seen Hou Yuanxiang for medical treatment and taken his homemade medicine. The old man passed away in September 2022. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Cheng said that his grandfather was diagnosed with rectal cancer in July 2019 and had spread to the lymph nodes. Relatives introduced him to Hou Yuanxiang. He has never met Hou Yuanxiang so far, and the two mainly communicate through WeChat. He said that after adding WeChat, Hou Yuanxiang once sent his personal profile, &quot;I also searched on Baidu about world cancer, committees, and cancer treatment experts, and I could indeed find this person. I thought this person was quite good.&quot; sharp&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When receiving a call from a Southern Weekend reporter, Li Cheng still called Hou Yuanxiang &quot;Professor Hou.&quot; When he learned that Hou Yuanxiang was not a professor and did not even have a medical license, he was surprised and said that if he had known about this situation, he would &quot;definitely consider&quot; whether to seek medical treatment from Hou Yuanxiang. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Cheng said that in addition to drinking Hou Yuanxiang’s anti-cancer drugs, his grandfather also ate the “nutritious meals” recommended by Hou Yuanxiang. &quot;After about three courses of treatment, (grandpa) recovered very well.&quot; Li Cheng said, for this reason, he also introduced many patients to Hou Yuanxiang. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, Li Cheng could not confirm whether his grandfather&#39;s condition improved for a time. &quot;Whether Professor Hou&#39;s medicine played a greater role or my grandfather&#39;s personal mentality played a greater role.&quot; Li Cheng said, &quot;We all say that (Hou Yuanxiang&#39;s medicine) is effective and easy to use, and it may have played a supporting role in grandpa&#39;s mental state.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yang Fengzhu has participated in many clinical trial demonstrations of drugs. . In his opinion, when patients undergo treatment, &quot;psychological effects are very important and can affect 30% of the (treatment) effect.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Cheng also said that while his grandfather was taking Hou Yuanxiang&#39;s medicine, he also underwent other treatments, including surgery, and &quot;Chinese and Western medicine worked simultaneously.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;After &quot;slimming down&quot; with fake medicine&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Neither the attorney nor Hou Yuanxiang himself expected that the first instance would impose such a severe sentence. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, according to relevant legal provisions and the amount of money involved ascertained by the driver’s agency, once Hou Yuanxiang’s self-made medicine is deemed to be counterfeit, the sentence will not be lenient. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During the first trial, many attorneys representing the Hou family argued that Hou Yuanxiang’s self-made medicine did not cause any harm to the patient. Hou Yuanxiang himself also stated that &quot;children can drink&quot; his medicine. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the lack of any harm does not mean that Hou Yuanxiang does not commit the crime of &quot;producing and selling counterfeit drugs&quot;, nor does it mean that he cannot be severely sentenced. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the criminal law before the 2011 revision, the crime of &quot;producing and selling counterfeit drugs&quot; requires &quot;serious harm to human health&quot; and causing death or serious injury in order to be sentenced to more than ten years in prison. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhao Yin said that in order to increase the crackdown on counterfeit drugs, the Eighth Amendment to the Criminal Law in 2011 amended the &quot;crime of producing and selling counterfeit drugs&quot; and no longer included &quot;seriously endangering human health&quot;. &quot;As a threshold for criminalization, as long as the production and sale of counterfeit medicines constitutes a crime. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, the Eighth Amendment to the Criminal Law no longer requires death or serious injury as the only condition for a heavy sentence. It stipulates that &quot;other particularly serious circumstances&quot; can also be harshly sentenced. In 2014, the Supreme People&#39;s Court and the Supreme People&#39;s Procuratorate issued a judicial interpretation that as long as the production and sale of counterfeit drugs reaches 500,000 yuan, it constitutes &quot;other particularly serious circumstances&quot; under the Eighth Amendment to the Criminal Law. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The first-instance court determined that Hou Yuanxiang’s production and sales of counterfeit drugs amounted to more than 14.36 million yuan, far exceeding 500,000 yuan. This means that once Hou Yuanxiang’s homemade medicine is determined to be counterfeit, he will be sentenced to more than ten years in prison. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Whether Hou Yuanxiang’s self-made medicine can be identified as counterfeit medicine must be based on the Drug Administration Law. Zhao Yin believes that before the law was revised in 2019, the identification of counterfeit drugs was relatively simple - as long as the drug did not obtain a batch number, it would be &quot;treated as a counterfeit drug&quot;, thus constituting a counterfeit drug in the sense of criminal law. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the Drug Administration Law revised in 2019 has made major changes to the definition of counterfeit drugs. Drugs without batch numbers are no longer automatically treated as counterfeit drugs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The industry generally believes that the above-mentioned modifications to the Drug Administration Law are related to the Hunan Lu Yong case. Lu Yong, a leukemia patient, purchased generic drugs from informal channels and helped his patients purchase the drugs. In 2018, the movie &quot;I&#39;m Not the God of Medicine&quot; based on it was released, triggering widespread public discussion on China&#39;s drug management system. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The revised Drug Administration Law stipulates that counterfeit drugs can be classified as counterfeit drugs only under four circumstances (see the information link at the end of the article for details). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to Cao Guoying, director of the Beijing Changjiang Pharmaceutical Development Foundation, who has long been engaged in anti-counterfeiting practice and research on drugs, after the revision of the Drug Administration Law, the number of counterfeit drug cases handled by the drug regulatory department showed a &quot;cliff-like decline.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to data from the website of the State Food and Drug Administration, in 2019, the number of counterfeit drug cases investigated and dealt with by drug regulatory departments across the country was 14,041. In the following year after the revision of the Drug Administration Law, the number of such cases There were only 7,361 cases, a decrease of nearly half. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A reporter from Southern Weekend searched the Judgment Documents Network using the keyword &quot;counterfeit drugs&quot; and found that based on the revision of the Drug Administration Law, the number of judgments in criminal cases of counterfeit drugs dropped sharply from 5,044 in 2019 to 2020. Of the 2,361 pieces, more than half were missing. There was also a downward trend in the following years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The 2019 version of the Drug Administration Law has significantly increased fines while &quot;slimming down&quot; counterfeit drugs. &quot;The starting point of the fine is 15 times the production and sales amount, and if it is less than 100,000, it will be calculated as 100,000.&quot; Zhao Yin said, &quot;As long as you are producing and selling counterfeit drugs, you will be fined at least 1.5 million, and you will be punished to death (for production, sales, etc.) Selling counterfeit medicines).&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Are Chinese medicinal materials medicines? &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In Cao Guoying&#39;s view, under the current overall environment of drug counterfeiting, it is &quot;very difficult&quot; for Qingdao to investigate the Hou Yuanxiang case. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, whether Hou Yuanxiang should be held criminally responsible for &quot;producing and selling counterfeit drugs&quot; has caused controversy in both the legal and traditional Chinese medicine circles. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Hou family’s attorney cited the revised Drug Administration Law in 2019 as an excuse to believe that Hou Yuanxiang’s self-made medicine is made from traditional Chinese medicinal materials and should not be regarded as counterfeit medicine. Hou Yuanxiang and others do not constitute “production.” , the crime of selling counterfeit medicines.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, according to the first-instance judgment of Hou Yuanxiang’s case, the public security organs initially opened a case against Hou Yuanxiang and others for “illegal business operations.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One month after the case was filed, the Qingdao Municipal Supervision Bureau issued a counterfeit drug identification certificate, identifying Hou Yuanxiang’s four self-made medicines as counterfeit drugs. According to the relevant judicial interpretations issued by the Supreme People&#39;s Court and the Supreme People&#39;s Procuratorate in 2014, if it is difficult to determine &quot;fake drugs&quot; or &quot;inferior drugs&quot;, the judicial authorities can make determinations based on the identification opinions issued by the drug regulatory authorities at or above the prefectural or municipal level. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the above-mentioned certification, Hou Yuanxiang’s self-made &quot;Anti-cancer No. 1&quot; and &quot;Anti-cancer No. 2&quot;, &quot;Liver&quot; which claims to treat liver cancer, and &quot;Wild Heart and Brain Decoction&quot; used to treat heart disease The medicine was deemed to be counterfeit. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the case entered the review and prosecution stage, at the request of the Huangdao District People’s Procuratorate, the Qingdao Municipal Supervision Bureau issued a supplementary explanation explaining why the product involved in the case was identified as a counterfeit drug. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The description pointed out that Hou Yuanxiang’s four self-made products “have no drug registration certificate number, no medical institution preparation record, no drug production license, no medical institution preparation license, no national standards, etc., but they are produced Drugs promoted for the treatment of cancer, liver cancer, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, etc. were sold to patients for treatment. The products involved were non-drugs. Everyone agreed that the above four involved products met the definition of drugs in the newly revised Drug Law...&quot;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;A lawyer representing the second instance pointed out that on the one hand, the above discussion said that the product involved in the case &quot;conforms to the definition of a drug&quot;, on the other hand, it also said that it was a &quot;non-drug&quot;. In his opinion, the reason why the Qingdao Municipal Supervision Bureau made such a statement is because according to the new drug management law, &quot;the only thing that can be caught is this one (non-drugs counterfeiting drugs)&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Regarding the issue of identifying counterfeit drugs produced by Hou Yuanxiang’s self-made medicine, Southern Weekend reporters contacted the Qingdao Municipal Supervision Bureau. The bureau refused to interview because Hou Yuanxiang’s case was under trial. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During the first trial, almost all the lawyers representing the Hou family questioned the determination of counterfeit drugs in the case. One of the lawyers pointed out that most of the medicinal materials used in &quot;Anti-cancer No. 1&quot; and &quot;Anti-cancer No. 2&quot; are in the 2020 edition of the &quot;Chinese Pharmacopoeia&quot;, which does not qualify as &quot;passing off drugs as non-drugs.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, in Zhao Yin&#39;s view, Chinese herbal medicines are not necessarily considered medicines - Chinese herbal medicines are only raw materials for making medicines and can be sold in the medicinal materials market, but the medicines must have a pharmaceutical business license. Sale. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Where did Hou Yuanxiang and his daughter buy the medicinal materials used in their homemade medicine? There was no explanation in the relevant confession cited in the first-instance judgment, and Hou Jing was unable to provide the purchase notes and legal supporting documents. According to the confession of Hou Jing&#39;s ex-husband Fu Songjie, the herbs Hou Jing purchased were sent via express delivery and logistics, and the consignees usually used pseudonyms. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Gang, the attorney for the second instance, questioned the identification of counterfeit drugs on which the first-instance judgment was based on the grounds that the identification of counterfeit drugs involved in the case had not been inspected by the provincial drug regulatory department. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the new judicial interpretation issued by the Supreme People&#39;s Court and the Supreme People&#39;s Procuratorate in 2022 (the old judicial interpretation in 2014 will be abolished after it takes effect), for the situation of &quot;non-drugs passing off as drugs&quot;, only when there is no dispute Only then can the municipal drug regulatory department directly identify the drug as counterfeit. If there is any dispute, it must be inspected by a drug inspection agency set up or determined by the drug regulatory department at or above the provincial level. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Li Gang’s view, the identification of counterfeit drugs involved in Hou Yuanxiang’s case is obviously controversial and should be tested. However, he believes that folk traditional Chinese medicine prescriptions lack national standards, and even if the results are tested, they lack scientificity and legality. Moreover, Hou Yuanxiang’s medicine was not tested at the time, and it has been detained for more than a year now. “It has already spoiled, how can it be tested?”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On November 5, 2023, another lawyer representing Hou Yuanxiang told Southern Weekend reporters, After the case was remanded for retrial, the procuratorate added a lot of evidence to the court, including an inspection report on Hou Yuanxiang&#39;s self-made medicine. According to this inspection report, Western medicine ingredients used to treat diabetes were detected in Hou Yuanxiang’s self-made medicine. Based on this, the Qingdao Municipal Supervision Bureau still determined that the product involved was a counterfeit medicine. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The above-mentioned attorney Hou Yuanxiang said that this shows that the drug regulatory department may no longer identify the products involved as counterfeit drugs according to the &quot;non-drug counterfeit drugs&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for the crimes involved in Hou Yuanxiang, Yang Zhiwei, a lawyer at Guangdong Faquan Law Firm, put forward another point of view to Southern Weekend reporters: If Hou Yuanxiang’s &quot;Anti-Cancer No. 1&quot; and &quot;Anti-Cancer No. 2&quot; are clearly related to the treatment of cancer &quot;There is no boundary.&quot; Hou Yuanxiang&#39;s purpose is to sell drugs to make money, so he may be guilty of fraud. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporters found such a case on the Judgment Documents Online: In 2019, Li Mouxiang, who had no medical qualifications, was arrested for producing and selling counterfeit medicines, but the procuratorate arrested him and charged him with fraud. He was prosecuted and the court sentenced him to 14 years in prison for fraud. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Is Hou Yuanxiang possibly suspected of fraud? A reporter from Southern Weekend asked Hou Yuanxiang&#39;s first-instance lawyer about this. After a few seconds of silence, the lawyer asked: Fraud? Isn&#39;t that heavier? Later, he said that Hou Yuanxiang was &quot;unlikely&quot; to commit fraud. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another first-instance attorney for Hou Yuanxiang believed that Hou Yuanxiang committed the crime of &quot;obstructing drug administration.&quot; This crime was newly established by the Eleventh Amendment to the Criminal Law promulgated in 2020. It refers to the criminal act of producing and selling drugs that have not obtained batch numbers but have not been identified as counterfeit drugs. This crime is stricter than the crime of &quot;producing and selling counterfeit drugs&quot;. light. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The lawyer did not accept an interview with Southern Weekend reporters, but said this: &quot;If his (Hou Yuanxiang) family is found not guilty, then we can all do anything in the name of traditional Chinese medicine. .&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>;Data link: Different definitions of &quot;counterfeit drugs&quot; before and after the 2019 revision of the Drug Administration Law: &lt; /span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>;Before revision: Any drug that meets any of the following circumstances is considered to be counterfeit:&lt;/span>;&lt; /p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>;(1) The ingredients contained in the drug are inconsistent with the ingredients specified in the national drug standards;&lt;/span>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>; (2) Passing off non-drugs as drugs or other drugs as such drugs. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>;Drugs that fall under any of the following circumstances will be treated as counterfeit:&lt;/span>;&lt; /p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>;(1) Use prohibited by the drug regulatory department of the State Council;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p >;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>;(2) Production or import without approval, which must be approved in accordance with this Law, or sold without inspection if it must be inspected in accordance with this Law &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>;(3) Deteriorated; &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p >;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, Kaiti_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>;(4) Contaminated;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti , italics_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>;(5) Production using raw materials that must obtain an approval number in accordance with this law but have not obtained an approval number;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style= &quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>; (6) The indicated indications or functions are beyond the prescribed scope. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>;Revised: If one of the following circumstances occurs, it is a counterfeit medicine:&lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>;(1) The ingredients contained in the drug do not comply with the ingredients specified in the national drug standards;&lt;/span>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>;(2) Passing off non-drugs as drugs or other drugs as such drugs;&lt;/span>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>;(3) Deteriorated medicines;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font -family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>;(4) The indicated indications or main functions of the drug exceed the prescribed scope. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 19 Nov 2023 09:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[“抗癌神医”的网络舆论战]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260879]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-19 09:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;During the investigation of Hou Yuanxiang, a large number of self-media videos of him &quot;crying out for injustice&quot; appeared on the Internet.

(For detailed reports on Hou Yuanxiang’s case, please see &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.infzm.com/content/260877&quot;>;&quot;Pretending to be an expert and practicing medicine for ten years, relying on secret recipes to make homemade anti-cancer drugs: the crime and punishment of an unlicensed &quot;miracle doctor&quot;&quot; &lt;/a>;)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The media mentioned by the lawyer refers to online self-media. In fact, mainstream media outlets reported on the Hou Yuanxiang counterfeit drug case only after the second-instance ruling remanded the case for retrial. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;With the help of self-media, Hou Yuanxiang, who was originally unknown, was described as a &quot;miraculous cancer doctor&quot; who was wrongly convicted. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;A woman with a public security background&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In mid-March 2023, more than a month after the first-instance verdict of Hou Yuanxiang&#39;s counterfeit drug case, an article titled &quot;Nine-year-old Xinxin asks for help: Mom The article &quot;Treat more than 3,000 cancer patients but was sentenced to 11 years in prison and fined 30 million yuan&quot; began to spread on the Internet. The article stated that Hou Yuanxiang’s daughter Hou Jing cured many difficult and complicated diseases using secret recipes of traditional Chinese medicine passed down from her ancestors. However, the traditional Chinese medicine liquid she prepared was deemed as fake medicine by the Qingdao Municipal Supervision Bureau “without any basis”. Hou Jing was sentenced to 11 years in the first trial. , the whole family is implicated. The article also attached a photo of Hou Jing&#39;s 9-year-old son asking for help: &quot;Mom, why are you guilty of treating illnesses and saving people? Let netizens across the country comment for you...&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This article sparked heated discussions among netizens. Southern Weekend reporters noticed that this article emphasized that Hou Jing graduated from a university of traditional Chinese medicine and was a herbalist, but avoided mentioning that Hou Jing did not have a medical certificate. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Jianying, Hou Yuanxiang’s daughter-in-law, told Southern Weekend reporters that after the first-instance verdict, Hou Yuanxiang wanted to use the Internet to “cry out injustice.” At that time, she asked for photos of her children. She was worried that the children would be affected, so she did not give them. Only later did I use a photo of Hou Jing’s son. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the end of June 2023, self-media person Wu Pengfei began to intervene in Hou Yuanxiang’s fake drug case. Wu Pengfei calls himself an &quot;old journalist&quot; and a &quot;well-known Internet writer&quot; and has accounts on Douyin, Kuaishou, Toutiao and other platforms. Southern Weekend reporters found out that Wu Pengfei worked for a media in Hubei Province in his early years and established a planning and marketing company after leaving the media. When he started to get involved in Hou Yuanxiang&#39;s counterfeit drug case, Wu Pengfei exposed a big news: a woman with a public security background once offered 10 million to buy Hou Yuanxiang&#39;s secret treatment recipe. After being rejected, she threatened to make Hou Yuanxiang&#39;s family wait. Go to jail. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many self-media bloggers quoted Wu Pengfei&#39;s above statement, so that &quot;a woman with a public security background cannot report Hou Yuanxiang by forcefully buying prescriptions&quot; has become the mainstream online public opinion on Hou Yuanxiang&#39;s fake drug case. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, Li Gang, Hou Yuanxiang’s second-instance attorney, told Southern Weekend reporters that although he heard Hou Yuanxiang talk about the matter, he did not see relevant evidence, and Hou Yuanxiang did not report to the judicial authorities that someone was blackmailing him. Accusation. As a lawyer, he had &quot;no comment&quot; on this claim. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hou Yuanxiang’s first-instance attorney Yang Zining also told Southern Weekend reporters that the above statement “cannot be reflected in the (case) file.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporters noticed that during the 2020 COVID-19 epidemic, Wu Pengfei once praised another &quot;miracle doctor&quot; - Li Yuehua, an unlicensed doctor who claimed that phenol injection can cure COVID-19, and also released news that Li Yuehua He was invited by South Korea to fight the epidemic, but the news was denied by South Korean officials. Li Yuehua himself also told the media that he did not know about it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporters tried to contact Wu Pengfei, but as of press time, the other party had not responded. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;How reliable are private investigations?&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;After publishing the above article, Wu Pengfei continued to publish short videos titled &quot;Unjust Cases of Private Traditional Chinese Medicine&quot; on multiple platforms. Now The 100th episode has been broadcast, and the number of views on the Douyin platform alone has exceeded 16 million. In these short videos, Wu Pengfei calls Hou Yuanxiang &quot;Mr. Hou&quot;, saying that he is &quot;the first person to treat cancer with traditional Chinese medicine&quot;, has &quot;unique medical skills&quot; and &quot;amazing curative effects&quot;, &quot;can be called a national treasure&quot;, and &quot;has many cancers in his body&quot;. Every hair on your head is gold.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, Wu Pengfei also cited a set of data to show that Hou Yuanxiang is a &quot;miracle doctor in cancer treatment.&quot; He said that &quot;a national non-governmental traditional Chinese medicine organization&quot; conducted a survey on the efficacy of China&#39;s top ten famous traditional Chinese medicine doctors in treating cancer: &quot;The first one is Hou Yuanxiang. At that time, it was confirmed that he cured 1,166 cancer patients. The second senior traditional Chinese medicine doctor confirmed that he had cured 1,166 cancer patients.&quot; Only 11 people have been cured.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Jianying also told Southern Weekend reporters that Hou Yuanxiang &quot;cured&quot; 1,166 cancer patients. &quot;He (Hou Yuanxiang) has records,&quot; she said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, Wu Pengfei did not say which organization the &quot;national non-governmental organization of traditional Chinese medicine&quot; is. In fact, even Li Gang had doubts about the data mentioned by Wu Pengfei: &quot;How reliable are private surveys?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In another short video, Wu Pengfei said that Hou Yuanxiang cured more than 3,000 cancer patients patient. In the personal introduction of the &quot;Yangdi Health&quot; website (a website that claims to provide communication, display, and promotion services for &quot;folk doctors&quot;), Hou Yuanxiang has &quot;cured more than 20,000 cancers.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some self-media have also questioned Hou Yuanxiang, but the number of clicks is not the same as Wu Pengfei’s short video. The self-media &quot;Chinese Medicine Doctor Chen Lei&quot; posted a video, calling Hou Yuanxiang a &quot;liar who manufactures and sells fake medicines&quot; and called on the public to view the case calmly: &quot;If you ignore the facts, you are not loving Chinese medicine, you are harming Chinese medicine.&quot;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;After the video was released, &quot;Chen Lei, a Chinese medicine doctor&quot; was immediately besieged by many supporters of Hou Yuanxiang on the Internet. Wu Pengfei even posted 8 short videos to refute the video. It didn’t take long for the video of “Chinese Medicine Doctor Chen Lei” to be removed from the shelves. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After seeing Hou Yuanxiang’s counterfeit medicine case online, Qian Hui, general manager of Nanjing Guishitang Traditional Chinese Medicine Clinic, decided to express support. Qian Hui once had a similar experience to Hou Yuanxiang. According to media reports, Qian Hui does not have a medical license. In order to avoid &quot;illegal medical practice&quot;, his traditional Chinese medicine clinic hires regular doctors to prescribe prescriptions for patients, while Qian Hui will &quot;guide&quot; on the side. The medicines prescribed by the doctors are all Guishitang. Homemade medicine based on our own &quot;secret recipe&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the end of 2017, Guishitang was reported. Because it did not obtain a batch number, its self-made medicine was deemed to be counterfeit by the Nanjing Food and Drug Administration. Qian Hui and many employees of Guishitang were suspected of &quot;producing and selling fake drugs.&quot; He was once criminally detained by the police for &quot;drug crimes&quot;, among which Qian Hui was imprisoned for 28 days. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Why do we support Hou Yuanxiang&#39;s innocence? The main reason is from the perspective of protecting traditional Chinese medicine, because once Hou Yuanxiang&#39;s case is found guilty, many traditional Chinese medicine practitioners will no longer be able to practice.&quot; Qian Hui Speaking to Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the view of Gong Feiyun, one of the &quot;partners&quot; of Guishitang, traditional Chinese medicine is &quot;folk Chinese medicine&quot;, and Hou Yuanxiang is one of many &quot;folk Chinese medicine&quot;. He defines &quot;folk traditional Chinese medicine&quot; as follows: a general term for traditional Chinese medicine outside the system, which has not received formal education in traditional Chinese medicine at a university and does not have a physician&#39;s license. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the end of June 2013, Gong Feiyun went to Qingdao to meet Hou Yuanxiang. According to Gong Feiyun, although Hou Yuanxiang was under &quot;residential surveillance&quot; by the police at the time, the control was not strict at the time. He tried to find a way to invite him out and took a video. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;Folk University of Traditional Chinese Medicine&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Gong Feiyun also participated in the mediation of the Guishitang counterfeit drug case. According to him, during the handling of the case, Guishitang engaged in a &quot;war of public opinion&quot; with the Nanjing police: first, a Nanjing media exposed the case from the police&#39;s standpoint, and then Gong Feiyun contacted a foreign media and issued a notice about Guishitang. the sound of. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the end, the case stayed at the public security investigation stage and failed to enter the procuratorate for review and prosecution. After this disaster, Guishitang has since focused on the Shanghai market. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before Qian Hui and Gong Feiyun, another &quot;folk Chinese medicine&quot; supporter Guan Yue also supported Hou Yuanxiang online. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Guan Yue calls himself &quot;the first president of a folk university of traditional Chinese medicine&quot;, &quot;a figure engraved on the Great Wall&quot; and &quot;president of the World Federation of Traditional Chinese Medicine Halls&quot;. He described the &quot;Folk University of Traditional Chinese Medicine&quot; as the &quot;Whampoa Military Academy&quot; of folk TCM. However, this university announced its establishment three years ago, but has not yet been established. Guan Yue once said publicly that after the establishment of this university, it will select &quot;folk traditional Chinese medicine practitioners&quot;, &quot;folk traditional Chinese medicine doctors&quot; and &quot;folk traditional Chinese medicine professors&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Relevant information shows that in June 2020, as soon as the slogan of establishing a &quot;private university of traditional Chinese medicine&quot; was shouted, the band announced that it would hold an founding meeting of a branch of the university. The day after the conference, Guan Yue posted an advertisement for a medical training class in multiple Chinese medicine groups, claiming that people without any medical foundation could learn it on the spot, and the training fee was 18,000 yuan for two days (discounts available). Unexpectedly, this move and the &quot;private university of traditional Chinese medicine&quot; were publicly questioned by Gu Jingyu, a doctor from a tertiary hospital in Jiangsu. Guan Le responded: &quot;The private university of traditional Chinese medicine&quot; is an innovation: &quot;Since it is an innovation, there must be no certificate. Since Without a certificate, it is definitely illegal...&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After going to Qingdao to meet Hou Yuanxiang, Gong Feiyun and Guan Yue met in Shanghai. The two also visited a professor at East China University of Political Science and Law who supports folk traditional Chinese medicine. , and asked him to speak out on the Hou Yuanxiang case. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On September 9, 2023, the second preparatory meeting for the establishment of a private university of traditional Chinese medicine planned by Guan Yue was held in Beijing. Qian Hui, Gong Yunfei, and Wei Baixing, who had spoken out on the Hou Yuanxiang case, all participated in this meeting. During the meeting, the Hou Yuanxiang case was discussed specifically. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“(Hou Yuanxiang’s case) is equivalent to uniting all folk Chinese medicine practitioners.” Gong Feiyun told Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the second-instance ruling in Hou Yuanxiang’s counterfeit drug case was remanded for retrial, Hou Yuanxiang’s supporters were jubilant and posted “good news” online one after another, believing that there had been a “major turnaround” in the case. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Shortly thereafter, another piece of news was revealed by self-media - Hou Yuanxiang was on a hunger strike, and the news was &quot;absolutely true.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, Wu Pengfei quickly sent a short video to clarify, saying that Hou Yuanxiang was unable to eat because of his physical weakness. His apprentice &quot;deliberately released news of the hunger strike because he was afraid that someone would assassinate Mr. Hou in order to attract the attention of the whole society.&quot; &quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A few days later, Wu Pengfei posted another short video, saying that &quot;Mr. Hou&quot; had recovered and started &quot;drinking a little wine&quot; with every meal, while the police officer guarding him could only cook noodles for three meals a day... …&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the second-instance lawyer Li Gang, after the second-instance remand for retrial, the police changed Hou Yuanxiang’s place of residential surveillance because “too many people knew (Hou Yuanxiang’s original place of residential surveillance).” &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;I am no longer involved in this matter&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Li Cheng (pseudonym) is the grandson of Hou Yuanxiang, a cancer patient from Jilin. He claims to be &quot;ignorant&quot; of many things. Under such circumstances, he also participated in the public opinion war to &quot;cry out injustice&quot; for Hou Yuanxiang. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On June 8, 2022, after Hou Yuanxiang filed an appeal, a person named &quot;Meteor and Sunset&quot; on WeChat added Li Cheng&#39;s WeChat account, claiming to be the daughter-in-law of &quot;Professor Hou&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Can you write a joint letter to Professor Hou to ask for mercy?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;What happened to Professor Hou?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I was reported by others. , Now he is being treated in the hospital and cannot take his own medicine.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Cheng then learned that Hou Yuanxiang was in trouble, and he told &quot;Meteor and Sunset&quot; that he could write a joint letter for Hou Yuanxiang. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Two months later, &quot;Meteor and Sunset&quot; pulled Li Cheng into a WeChat group of cancer patients supporting Hou Yuanxiang. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Cheng has a number labeled &quot;Director Li&#39;s Anti-Cancer&quot; stored in his mobile phone. This number was given to him by Hou Yuanxiang. When he bought medicine for his grandfather, he contacted this &quot;Director Li&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before receiving a call from a reporter from Southern Weekend, Li Cheng had always thought that &quot;Director Li&quot; was called &quot;Li Jianying&quot; and that he was the person in charge of pharmaceuticals in the hospital where Hou Yuanxiang worked. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But in fact, &quot;Director Li&quot; is Hou Yuanxiang&#39;s son Hou Lei, and &quot;Meteor and Sunset&quot; is Li Jianying. She is also the only adult in the Hou family who is not involved in the case. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the first-instance judgment, in Hou Yuanxiang’s case, Hou Yuanxiang was known as “Professor Hou” and was responsible for providing formulas, diagnosing and treating cancer diseases, and selling medicines. His daughter Hou Jing was responsible for diagnosing and treating diseases other than cancer, selling medicines, and purchasing medicines. Chinese herbal medicines, brewing Chinese medicines, etc., while his son Hou Lei pretended to be &quot;Director Li&quot;, the doctor in charge of taking and withdrawing medicines in the background, that is, Li Jianying. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;More than a month after adding &quot;Meteor and Sunset&quot; on WeChat, Li Cheng and Hou Yuanxiang also got in touch. &quot;He (Hou Yuanxiang) said to put my information online, and I said yes, as long as it is helpful to your case.&quot; Li Cheng said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Cheng also suggested that Hou Yuanxiang talk about this matter on the self-media platform to increase attention. &quot;He said yes, I will let my family do it.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Later, Hou Yuanxiang sent some case materials to Li Cheng and asked him to help contact the media. Nothing was heard from him since. Li Cheng also failed to help Hou Yuanxiang contact the media. Until late July 2023, he sent a message to Hou Yuanxiang, &quot;He replied to me and said that the (second trial) trial was about to start and the problem was not big.&quot; This was the last time Li Cheng contacted Hou Yuanxiang. Prior to this, the Hou family proposed to put Li Cheng&#39;s personal information online as one of Hou Yuanxiang&#39;s cases of &quot;curing&quot; cancer patients, and he agreed. However, before the list was posted online, Li Cheng&#39;s grandfather passed away. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After learning the truth, Li Cheng realized that the matter was &quot;not that simple&quot; - &quot;I didn&#39;t know any of this, I didn&#39;t know at all. I was just a patient&#39;s family member, thinking if I could help If you want, please help, but the prerequisite must be within the framework of the law...I will no longer be involved in this matter.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS: &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https: //feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 19 Nov 2023 09:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[床虱危机或已蔓延至香港：为何太阳晒不倒，杀虫剂无效？丨硬核唠科]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260875]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-19 08:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https:// feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange &quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 19 Nov 2023 08:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[同性性行为进化的逻辑]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260881]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-18 22:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Same-sex sexual behavior cannot directly produce offspring, and has long been regarded as a paradox of Darwinian evolution. . Because according to general understanding, in nature where natural selection and survival of the fittest occur, same-sex sexual behavior consumes precious energy and time but fails to produce offspring. Such behavior should have been eliminated in evolution, but the reality is that same-sex sexual behavior is still in the process of evolution. There is no shortage of them in nature and human society. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Scientists have discovered same-sex behavior in more than 1,500 species of animals. Such behavior is not affected by gender and can occur between two males or two females. It appears in artificial breeding environments and also in the wild. It is not an accidental behavior forced by extreme environments. This also poses a difficult problem for scientists to understand its evolutionary logic. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In October 2023, researchers from the University of Granada in Spain and other institutions tried to verify some relevant explanatory hypotheses through germline analysis of a large number of mammal same-sex sexual behavior information. Their latest research, published in Nature Communications, suggests that the evolution of same-sex sexual behavior is likely an adaptation to nature. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Maintaining same-sex social relationships&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;“Same-sex sexual behavior occurs in many mammalian species, including our relatives the great apes. Rather than classifying it as maladaptive or abnormal behavior, our study shows that this sexual behavior in mammals is a convergent adaptation that helps maintain social relationships and reduce same-sex conflicts.&quot; Lead author of the latest study, while at the Spanish Arid Zone Experimental Station Function and Evolution José M. Gómez, a professor at the Department of Ecology and the University of Granada, told Southern Weekend reporters that although same-sex sexual behavior occurs in many species, it is especially common among primates. This may Precisely because primates are more social than many other groups of mammals. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From a data point of view, research has found same-sex sexual behavior in more than 260 species of mammals. In more than 80% of the cases, it takes the form of back crawling or genital contact, and less than 30% Some species even display same-sex behavior through courtship or pairing. Judging from the age, same-sex sexual behavior mainly occurs in adult mammals, and young same-sex sexual behavior is only found in 10 species of animals. From an environmental perspective, more than 80% of the samples had same-sex sexual behavior occurring in wild or semi-wild environments. In terms of gender, same-sex behavior is relatively evenly distributed among mammals. Female same-sex behavior has been recorded in more than 160 species, and male same-sex behavior has been found in more than 190 species. Combined, about half of all species have same-sex behavior. Homosexuality involving two genders at the same time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is worth noting that the latest study is only based on existing records of same-sex sexual behavior in mammals and does not represent the entire situation of mammals. In fact, because the discovery of same-sex sexual behavior in nature relies on observation, and in some species females and males look very similar, and it is even difficult to distinguish between male and female. Some scientists estimate that the current records of same-sex sexual behavior in nature should be underestimated. Moreover, compared with mammals, birds, reptiles, fish, insects and other invertebrates are either small in size or live far away from the ground, making observation difficult, but they have all recorded same-sex sexual behavior. Therefore, patterns of same-sex sexual behavior in nature are far more complex than what has been observed in mammals. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Previously, many hypotheses interpreted same-sex sexual behavior as maladaptive or abnormal behavior, speculating that this behavior may be a manifestation of specific conditions such as incorrect gender identity, lack of opposite-sex peers, or frustration with opposite-sex sexual behavior. From the perspective of sexual behavior scenarios, the latest research has found that same-sex sexual behavior does not necessarily require extremely special occasions. Although same-sex sexual behavior is rare in some species and can only be observed in very special circumstances, for about 40% of the mammals studied, same-sex sexual behavior can be regarded as moderate to high frequency activity during a specific period of time, and during mating Seasons are easy to observe. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Same-sex and opposite-sex coexist&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;And some behavioral observations have long shown that same-sex sexual behavior may play a positive role in some populations. For example, some same-sex behavior among male bottlenose dolphins may help strengthen alliances among small groups, and same-sex behavior among female bonobo groups may promote reconciliation among members. However, the latest study&#39;s germline analysis does not focus on the mechanisms of same-sex sexual behavior in specific species, but uses large-scale statistics to link same-sex sexual behavior to social behavior. This research shows that same-sex sexual behavior is similar to many other behavioral traits that have evolved through natural selection. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Professor Jose Gomez reminded that the meaning of same-sex sexual behavior here should be understood within the framework of evolutionary biology, which is still different from the current human society’s views on gender and other related issues. Because in the study of evolutionary biology, same-sex sexual behavior is a temporary behavior of individuals in a certain period of time, not a permanent behavior or life choice. They may also have heterosexual sexual behavior at the same time. Therefore, it cannot be directly related to human society. behavior analogy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In human society, issues related to same-sex sexual behavior are rooted in different cultural environments and historical traditions in different places, and are more complicated to understand. But in recent years, the discussion of distinguishing human same-sex sexual behavior has also attracted the attention of scientists. The core concern is to what extent people who have had same-sex sexual behavior can be defined as homosexual. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2019, researchers from Harvard University and other institutions published a large-scale genetic study in Science magazine, trying to reveal the genetic characteristics of same-sex sexual behavior, which is the so-called &quot;homosexuality&quot; Gene&quot;. Through collaboration with the British Biobank and genetic testing analysis company 23andMe, researchers finally identified multiple genetic loci related to same-sex sexual behavior from hundreds of thousands of genetic samples, indicating that the &quot;gay gene&quot; is similar to other behavioral characteristics. It is also polygenic. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But in 2021, scientists from sex and gender research institutions such as Indiana University’s Kinsey Institute publicly expressed opposition to this research, believing that it only distinguishes people by whether they have had same-sex sexual intercourse. It conflates heterosexuality, bisexuality, and homosexuality, and does not accurately measure people&#39;s sexual behavior, sexual attraction, and sexual identity. Therefore, the genetic characteristics ultimately discovered may not reveal the tendency to have same-sex sexual behavior, but only reveal the preferences. The personality trait of pursuing novelty. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Because in the view of sexology researchers, heterosexuality should be a continuous pattern of sexual attraction. Just because a person has had same-sex sexual behavior does not mean that he is not heterosexual. Alfred Kinsey, the pioneer of sexology research, developed a scale very early to distinguish people who have had same-sex sexual behavior. According to the frequency of same-sex sexual behavior, people can be divided into multiple types, rather than Either gay or straight. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;It may help reproduction&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The controversy in human society about how to distinguish same-sex sexual behavior from homosexuality also reflects a difficulty in understanding the logic of evolution to a certain extent. Compared with human society, which highly binds concepts such as &quot;same-sex sexual behavior&quot;, &quot;homosexuality&quot; and &quot;no offspring&quot;, same-sex sexual behavior may never mean &quot;no offspring&quot; in the long evolutionary history. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Darwin&#39;s paradox of evolution should be put aside; it no longer exists because the existence of bisexual behavior in various animal species ensures that same-sex behavior does not hinder reproductive success.&quot; Empire Vincent Savolainen, a professor at the Department of Life Sciences of the Polytechnic Institute of Technology, told Southern Weekend reporters that there are many concepts surrounding same-sex sexual behavior, but from a biological perspective, same-sex sexual behavior may be the same as homosexuality, bisexuality, etc. There are some similar mechanisms and evolutionary logic, which biologists can continue to study in the future. At the same time, psychologists can also delve into other aspects of this complex behavior, such as sexual preferences, to better understand the evolution of same-sex behavior. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From a historical perspective on same-sex sexual behavior, the key reason why evolutionary logic is difficult to understand is that it is speculated that its adaptation cost is too high and the cost of behavior is too high. However, including the latest research, many studies in recent years have shown that same-sex sexual behavior does not mean &quot;no offspring&quot; in the evolutionary process, but may have a positive impact on the reproduction of offspring in other indirect ways. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In 2021, the scientist Brendan Zietsch, a scientist at the University of Queensland, Australia, used hundreds of thousands of samples of genetic data to simulate human evolution, which also contains a lot of heterosexuality Data from partner. Analysis shows that among people with heterosexual behaviors, genetic genes related to homosexual behavior can at the same time allow people to have more heterosexual partners, which means that they have obtained sexual mating advantages. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Further analysis shows that behind this is also related to the characteristics of openness and adventure. People with more open personality will be more willing to try new things, and have stronger curiosity and imagination. Researchers speculate that genetically -related genes related to the tendency of homosexual behavior also give people related personality traits, which makes people with related genetic genes more advantageous in finding heterosexual partners. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; As a result, although homosexual behavior itself does not produce offspring, related genes can allow people to gain the advantages of fertility offspring, which leads to homosexual behavior to this day. However, Brundan Ziqi emphasized that although this study has the advantages of data, the relevant interpretation is still exploratory, and more research needs to understand the performance related to homosexual behavior to understand The foundation of its evolution. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>; The hereditary of the long -term primary &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; Professor Vincent Savolina has also carried out research on homosexual behavior, and obtained the conclusion of similar support for fertility advantages . In August 2023, through analysis of the three years of observation of data from the Ganges monkey, they found that homosexual behaviors in the Ganges monkey community were common, and they were basically not affected by age or community structure. What adaptability, instead, the same sexual behavior regulates the relationship between companions and improves the success rate of reproduction. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Related research published in &quot;Nature Ecology &amp; Amp; Evolution&quot;, which observed the social and sexual behavior of more than 200 male Ganges monkeys. Combined with the bloodline data of decades ago, studies have shown that the same sexual behavior in the male Ganges monkeys is both duplicate and hereditary, with a genetic rate of 6.4%. The first evidence that can be inherited. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;Ganges monkey shared more than 70%of DNA with humans, tracing back to about 25 million years ago, and we also have a common ancestor with us. They are the main non -human long categories used in biomedical research. Animals are also an excellent model of ecological problems such as homosexual behavior. However, it is worth noting that there are still differences between the Ganges monkey and humans. We hope to study these intricate mysteries and find it. Our common behavior of evolutionary history. &quot;Professor Vincent Savarinen explained to the reporter from the south weekend that the latest research shows that homosexual behavior may be a common feature of the long -awaited ecology of spiritual long animals. Simplic behavior is inspired, but due to some unique social factors in human society, homosexual behavior in human society does have a great price. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;Humanity seems to be the only species that shows strict homosexuality.&quot; Professor Vincent Savolina said that cultural factors will affect this phenomenon. For example, in Samoa, although some gays have no descendants, they actually assume the role of women in the society and help children who support relatives. &quot;I hope that our research can play a role in cultivating more tolerance culture, and to inclusive gender diversity in nature and human society.&quot; &lt;/P>; &lt;p>; &lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 18 Nov 2023 22:25:23 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
