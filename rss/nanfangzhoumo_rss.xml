It is reported that the &quot;takeaway boy&quot; is Yegor Semyonov, a 32-year-old man from Melitopol, Ukraine. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Russian Armavir City Court arrested Yegor Semyonov for &quot;disturbing the peace&quot; and detained him for 15 days. He may face more serious &quot;terrorism&quot; next accusation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Victor Fisen, chairman of the Veterans Committee of Russia&#39;s Armavir Higher Military Aviation School, said that this was a large-scale poisoning attempt against the school&#39;s graduates. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This incident also aroused public attention on the &quot;secret war&quot; between Russian and Ukrainian intelligence agents. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;Poisonous Big Cake&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;On October 21, 77 alumni of the Armavir Higher Military Aviation School in Krasnodar Krai, Russia, from the class of 2003, returned to school to attend Graduation 20 The anniversary celebrations included a number of active Russian Air Force pilots and senior officials. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During the restaurant party, a &quot;takeaway boy&quot; suddenly delivered a 20-kilogram cake and several boxes of whiskey, claiming to be a gift from an alumnus who could not attend the party. The huge two The layer cake immediately grabbed everyone&#39;s attention. Everyone immediately started taking photos and posting in the chat group to express their gratitude. At the same time, everyone was asking each other who was the person who sent this gift. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, since no one &quot;claimed&quot; the gift, partygoers became suspicious of the origins of the cake and whiskey. A Russian military officer who attended the event prevented the pilots present from drinking and eating cakes and immediately reported it to the Russian Federal Security Service. Subsequently, the Russian Federal Security Service tested the cake and whiskey and found that they contained highly toxic substances. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, a school security officer captured the figure of the &quot;delivery boy&quot; from the surveillance video. Agents of the Russian security service identified the &quot;takeaway boy&quot; as 32-year-old Yegor Semyonov. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Russian police quickly identified Semyonov and arrested him. After graduating from high school, Semyonov became a weightlifting coach, often participating in various weightlifting competitions, and later worked as a security guard. Since 2015, Semyonov has lived in the suburbs of Moscow, the Russian capital, and has been engaged in the installation of video surveillance systems and walkie-talkies. In recent years, he has developed a keen interest in firearms and sports shooting. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After delivering the poisonous cake, Semenov planned to fly back to Moscow, but was intercepted and taken away by Russian security personnel at the airport. Semyonov confessed to his actions and told prosecutors how he learned about the celebrations. He even painted the military academy&#39;s logo onto the cake for a greater realistic effect. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Russian side believes that Semyonov may be a spy sent by Kiev to Moscow. This &quot;toxic plot&quot; to murder the Russian pilot was probably carried out under the instruction of Kiev. This is Ukrainian defense intelligence An assassination planned by the General Administration. If Russia relaxes its vigilance and becomes paralyzed this time, it will pay a heavy price for this incident. Currently, Russian security services are &quot;looking for the person who made the cake and others involved in this sabotage.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Russian-Ukrainian Unrestricted War&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The national security department or the military intelligence department serves the needs of national security military struggle. To a certain extent, it can kill the opponent or be defeated by the opponent. If put to death, one of the two must be one. The competition between the Russian and Ukrainian intelligence services can be described as each other’s shadow. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At a time when the war between Russia and Ukraine is raging, the &quot;poisoning of a delivery boy&quot; incident in Ukraine shows that both Russia and Ukraine have the characteristics of &quot;unrestricted warfare&quot; in terms of means, strategies, and moral integrity. This kind of Although the lethality of &quot;underhanded tactics&quot; cannot change the outcome of a conflict, it will have certain negative effects on changing the local situation on the battlefield, damaging the opponent&#39;s morale, and selecting combat methods. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At present, Ukraine’s intelligence system structure and confrontation capabilities have been greatly improved. The U.S. intelligence agency is huge, and with the human and technical intelligence support provided by the U.S. intelligence agencies to Ukraine, Ukraine and Russia are launching an intelligence &quot;secret war&quot; on the &quot;hidden&quot; front. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Ukrainian Military Intelligence Agency has been involved in many assassinations in Russia. In 2022, the National Security Service of Ukraine planned and executed the car bombing that killed Dukina. A Ukrainian security official said: &quot;Dukina is the daughter of a Russian propagandist. The car bombings and other actions on Russian soil were meant to show Ukraine&#39;s enemies that even for those &#39;disrespecting Ukraine, punishment is at hand&#39; .&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A former official of the Fifth Directorate of the Ukrainian National Security Agency said that these actions can only leave a &quot;deep impression&quot; on Zelensky, but cannot help the Ukrainian army move towards victory. “Kill one and another will soon take his place.” The assassination campaign in Ukraine was clearly driven more by impulse than logic, and not only lacked a strategic objective but may have exposed Ukrainian intelligence agents. This kind of &quot;assassination squad&quot; may be free from the hands of the president or the military and become a source of &quot;terrorism&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the Russia-Ukraine conflict, Western countries’ intelligence support for Ukraine has even more impact than arms assistance. Ukraine’s new intelligence capabilities proved their worth at the outset of the Russian-Ukrainian conflict. The Ukrainian Security Service obtained intelligence about high-value Russian targets and carried out strikes, killing several commanders. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The top priority target of the Ukrainian National Security Agency is the bridge connecting the Russian mainland and the island of Crimea. In 2022, the Ukrainian Security Bureau attacked the bridge twice. The Ukrainian Security Bureau placed powerful explosives in a truck and later used drones to launch a second sabotage attack on the bridge. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ukrainian military intelligence also used its own drone fleet to launch dozens of attacks in Russia, including penetrating Russian air defense systems and attacking buildings in Moscow. In May 2023, an operation affected part of the roof of the Kremlin. The attacks were carried out by both long-range drones launched from Ukraine and by agents and guerrillas working in Russia. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Regarding the series of assassinations and sneak attacks carried out by the U.S.-backed Ukrainian intelligence agencies, the Russian government has repeatedly accused Ukraine of adopting a &quot;terrorist attack&quot; strategy and has also taken a series of powerful counterattacks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On August 9, 2023, ITASS reported that the Russian Federal Security Service arrested a Russian citizen recruited by Ukrainian intelligence services and accused him of trying to blow up a bomb in Crimea in June. A natural gas pipeline. On August 13, the Russian Ministry of Defense released a video of a Russian drone destroying the &quot;Starlink&quot; satellite system communication terminal used by the Ukrainian army. The Russian drone operator discovered the &quot;Starlink&quot; satellite system communication terminal supported by the US military and disguised by the Ukrainian army. The drone accurately struck and destroyed the communication terminal. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Russian Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Zakharova said on a TV program on October 24: &quot;Whether it is in Russia or in its surrounding areas, a large number of terrorist attacks will not start in 2022, but will start later. Start early. It is no secret to anyone that the security services affiliated with the Kiev regime are responsible for these large numbers of terrorist attacks.&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;An opponent is an opponent&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Historically, Russia and Ukraine The intelligence system was born out of the KGB during the Soviet period. After the disintegration of the Soviet Union, the Russian and Ukrainian intelligence agencies adopted an administrative system with decentralized powers and separate administrations.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1995, Russia established the new Federal Security Service and the Foreign Intelligence Service. , the Federal Security Service of counterintelligence. The Russian General Staff established the &quot;GRU&quot; responsible for military intelligence, which is the General Intelligence Directorate of the Russian Armed Forces General Staff. Its director is concurrently served by a Russian Deputy Chief of General Staff. The main goal is Collect military intelligence from strategic to tactical levels.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ukraine established the National Security Agency in March 1992, maintaining a special system directly led by the President of Ukraine, and inherited almost all functions of the KGB during the Soviet period. 1993 In July 2020, Ukraine established a Military Intelligence Bureau in the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, similar to Russia’s Intelligence Bureau of the General Staff.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The current construction of Ukraine’s intelligence system has also received full support from the United States.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To control the risk of &quot;serious penetration by Russia&#39;s FSB,&quot; the CIA spent tens of millions of dollars to transform Ukraine&#39;s Soviet-style spy agency into a powerful ally against Moscow. The CIA and Ukraine&#39;s National Security Service Cooperate to establish a new department against Russia, the &quot;Fifth Directorate&quot;, intended to implement &quot;urgent measures&quot; against Russia.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The National Security Service of Ukraine has also added a Sixth Directorate to cooperate with the British MI6. Training base Based outside Kiev, CIA personnel mentor hand-picked trainees, requiring agents to &quot;be able to operate behind the lines and work as covert teams.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In helping the Ukrainian Security Service establish the &quot;Secret Service&quot; At the same time as the &quot;Fifth Directorate&quot;, the CIA also invested &quot;tens of millions of dollars&quot; to transform Ukraine&#39;s military intelligence agency. A former US intelligence official who has worked in Ukraine said: &quot;We have calculated that the Military Intelligence Agency is a smaller, A more agile organization where we can have a greater impact. MI is our little baby. We provide them with new equipment and training. ”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At bases in Ukraine and later the United States, Ukrainian MI agents were trained in a variety of skills ranging from covert exercises behind enemy lines to weapons platforms and explosives. The CIA provided state-of-the-art surveillance and electronic eavesdropping systems, including mobile devices that could be placed along Russian-controlled routes in eastern Ukraine and software used to eavesdrop on the cell phones of Russian officials visiting the occupied territories from Moscow, with all information collected being shared with the United States.&lt;/p>; &lt; p>;A former senior military intelligence officer said: &quot;In one day, we can intercept 250,000 to 300,000 individual communications from the Russian army and the Federal Security Service, and the amount of information is so large that we cannot manage it ourselves. ”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Thousands of data were transmitted back to Washington through the CIA’s newly constructed facilities, where they were scrutinized by CIA and NSA analysts.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Military Intelligence also A network of informants was established within the Russian security apparatus. As a measure of mutual trust between the United States and Ukraine, the CIA was allowed direct contact with agents recruited and managed by Ukrainian intelligence services.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Russian-Ukrainian Intelligence Special Operations , due to different countries, different social systems, different war backgrounds and natures, the tactics and methods are also very different, and the effects are very different.&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The incident of Ukrainian takeaways delivering poisonous cakes to Russian pilots shows that Ukrainian agents It has been trying to launch raids on Russia through various channels in an attempt to weaken its military power and national security. The Russian intelligence agencies have taken timely and powerful countermeasures. This shows that both Russia and Ukraine have strong intelligence systems to support them to varying degrees. .&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 08 Nov 2023 18:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[收容两百万阿富汗难民的巴基斯坦为何“变脸”]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260164]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-08 17:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In the early morning, gunfire rang out again in Pakistan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On November 4, 2023, the Pakistani military stated that it killed 9 militants that day. The militants attempted to attack an air force training base in Miyanwali, Punjab. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;After the incident, the &quot;Pakistan Jihad Movement&quot; issued a statement to the media stating that it was responsible for the attack. This is a newly emerged armed organization affiliated with the Pakistani Taliban (referred to as &quot;Bata&quot;). &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Many interviewed experts and scholars told Southern Weekend reporters that the Bata Organization has recently frequently launched various forms of terrorist attacks in Pakistan in an attempt to achieve its political goals. The purpose has brought great pressure to Pakistan&#39;s security situation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;It is noteworthy that Pakistan announced a large-scale &quot;deportation order&quot; on October 3, indicating that there are more than 1.7 million undocumented foreigners (mostly Afghan refugees) who are in Pakistan illegally must leave the country by November 1 or face arrest and deportation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;This decision has caused concern among tens of thousands of Afghans. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Major host countries for Afghan refugees&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;&amp;nbsp ;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Majda, 31, was born in Pakistan and lives with her husband and six children in an apartment building in Sohrab Goth. Here, Saurabh Goth is a seedy suburb with narrow streets littered with garbage. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;We have no home and no job in Afghanistan,&quot; she told the media. Her family had relevant documents but were still harassed. &quot;Pakistan is our home, we have been living here for a long time.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;We have our own barbecue restaurant and butcher shop here.&quot; Mohammad &quot;This country is driving away its guests,&quot; he said before boarding the bus back to Afghanistan.&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Sayyid Muhammad is an undocumented Afghan refugee and One of the immigrants. When he carried the doctor&#39;s prescription for his ailing mother on his shoulders to the Afghanistan-Pakistan border, he found no store where he could buy the medicine. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Detention centers&quot; have been set up in four provinces of Pakistan to detain &quot;illegal&quot; foreigners who have not left the country within the time limit. Most refugees and migrants gathered at border crossings, awaiting exit procedures. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Most Afghan refugees entered Pakistan at three points in time: the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan in 1979, the US invasion after the &quot;911&quot; incident, and the Afghan regime change in 2021 After the change. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The United Nations Refugee Agency announced that there are approximately 2 million Afghan refugees in Pakistan, making it the country hosting the largest number of Afghan refugees. But the process for refugees to obtain a legal residence permit in Pakistan is by no means easy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;span>;“Many Afghan refugees have their own businesses and houses in Pakistan, and their children go to school there&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;,&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;Their descendants have not even seen Afghanistan&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;.&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;”&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;Atta Nassib, professor of international affairs at George Washington University, said&lt;/span>; &lt;span>;,&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;But given that Pakistan does not have a dual citizenship law, most Afghans cannot obtain Pakistani citizenship. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;During the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, it was a time when the United States and the Soviet Union were competing for hegemony. The United States and other NATO countries hope that Pakistan can accept Afghan refugees and provide financial and material support to Pakistan to ease the pressure on Pakistan to accept refugees. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;With the help of international aid, Pakistan not only built refugee camps, but also helped refugees work and receive education, and also provided certain policy support. For Pakistan at that time, hosting refugees became a win-win choice, and the domestic economy also developed to a certain extent. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Zhang Jiadong, director of the South Asian Studies Center at Fudan University, believes that during the war, Pakistan received aid from many countries, and Pakistan also used part of the aid money to help Afghan refugees. . But now, many countries have reduced or even stopped aid. Pakistan&#39;s economic burden has also risen. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Pakistan&#39;s expulsion may cause more contradictions and conflicts with Afghanistan in the short term.&quot; Zhang Jiadong said, but from the perspective of Pakistan , driving some people back will make it easier to control the remaining refugees, that is, &quot;long-term pain is worse than short-term pain.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;In addition to economic issues, the grievances between Pakistan and Afghanistan are particularly deep.&quot; He said that Pakistan and Afghanistan also have many cross-border ethnic issues, which have led to constant border disputes. At present, these contradictions have not been properly resolved. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;&quot;Love and hate&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The terrorist attack on November 4 is not uncommon in Pakistan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On September 6 this year, fierce conflicts broke out between Pakistani and Afghan border guards, and Pakistan subsequently closed a key crossing point with Afghanistan in the northwest. On the same day, armed men attacked two Pakistani security posts near Pakistan&#39;s northern border, killing four soldiers and 12 attackers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The Pakistani military noted in a statement that the attackers were &quot;equipped with the latest weapons&quot; and suggested they may have crossed the border from Afghanistan. Pakistan urges not to allow terrorists to use Afghan soil to carry out long-term terrorist acts against Pakistan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In the past two years, the violence of &quot;Bata&quot;-led attacks has increased. Just in January 2023, a suicide bombing occurred at a mosque in Peshawar, the capital of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province in northwestern Pakistan on the afternoon of the 30th. Hundreds of people died and more than 200 were injured. On the night of the incident, &quot;Bata&quot; members said that the attack was revenge for the previous police crackdown on Bata. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Ma Jianfu, director of the Pakistan Studies Center at Northern University for Nationalities, believes that after the change of Afghan regime, the bilateral relations that Pakistan expected were not established. Instead, conflicts and frictions continued, especially There have been many exchanges of fire in border areas. Pakistan has also become the target of terrorist attacks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Since 2023, in addition to frequent attacks by traditional terrorist forces in Pakistan, the Khorasan branch of the &quot;Islamic State&quot; has also begun to attack Afghanistan. Transfer within Pakistan. This has caused tremendous security and domestic pressure on Pakistan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;It is difficult for Pakistan to control border security issues, and the cost is extremely high in reality.&quot; Zhang Jiadong said that a large number of weapons are now flowing from Afghanistan to Pakistan, which has become a problem for many Equipment of anti-Pakistani militants. &quot;Afghanistan is not particularly active in helping Pakistan, which makes Pakistan quite annoyed.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The Pakistani government also accused Afghanistan of providing provision for militant groups that carried out these attacks. provided a &quot;safe haven&quot;, causing tensions in Pakistan-Afghanistan relations. It said that of the 24 suicide bombings in Pakistan in 2023, 14 were carried out by Afghans. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;But what is noteworthy is that as early as the 1990s, when the Taliban first seized power in Afghanistan, some Taliban members came from Pakistan. Many media reports stated that Pakistani military officers even directly participated in the Taliban&#39;s operations at that time and received support from the Pakistan Intelligence Agency. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Pakistan is an important regional player in the power game in Afghanistan.&quot; Ma Jianfu said. However, the rise of the Taliban has stimulated the development of religious extremism and ethnic separatism in South Asia, causing refugee and drug problems to further spill over into South Asia, resulting in severe challenges to the regional security situation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Other armed organizations saw that they could successfully seize power, and they also tried to imitate and follow suit. This is a major incentive for terrorist forces in Pakistan to become active again.&quot; Zeng Xiangyu Analysis shows that the security situation in Pakistan had improved in the past few years, but has worsened significantly recently. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;It is undeniable that Baa has a unique relationship. For example, the two countries share a border of about 2,570 kilometers and are also important trading partners. There are also many close ties with each other such as culture, race and religion. The outside world believes that Pakistan and Afghanistan are &quot;love-hate&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Pakistan has hosted millions of Afghan refugees for many years. This is not an easy task.&quot; Zeng Xiangyu said that not every country can do this Not to mention that Pakistan is not a rich country. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Ma Jianfu believes that Pakistan has tried to expel or repatriate Afghan refugees many times over the past decades, but with poor results. The regular flow of Afghan refugees to and from the Pakistan-Afghanistan border area has become the norm. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Deportation order&quot; is also a &quot;pressure order&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot; text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Today we say goodbye to the people of Afghanistan as they begin their journey home .&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Earlier, Pakistan’s interior minister publicly tweeted on social media and attached a video of Afghans boarding a bus, adding &quot;This action proves that Pakistan is determined to deport any individual living in the country without proper documentation.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;span>;&quot;If they don&#39;t send us Send it back and we will live here for the rest of our lives.&quot; 35-year-old Afghan Mohammad Rahim&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;,&lt;/span>;&lt;span>; was born in Pakistan.

Mohmand has no family in Afghanistan. She didn&#39;t know where to go next. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;For decades, millions of Afghan refugees have lived in Pakistan for a long time, bringing huge financial burdens and various risks to Pakistan. A large number of illegal refugees The detention of Afghan refugees not only brings certain security risks, but also has a certain impact on the employment of Pakistanis.&quot; Ma Jianfu analyzed that Pakistan&#39;s expulsion of Afghan refugees is also due to economic pressure. Undocumented immigrants and refugees are widely believed to have drained the country&#39;s resources for decades. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;For Pakistan&#39;s &quot;deportation order&quot; operation, the United Nations Refugee Agency and the International Organization for Migration condemned Pakistan&#39;s plan to bring &quot; Serious protection risk”. Restrictions on female NGO staff in Afghanistan have resulted in fewer employment opportunities for women in the country. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Data from the United Nations Refugee Agency shows that among Afghans who have recently returned home, 78% said that fear of being arrested in Pakistan was the reason for their departure. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Pakistan&#39;s expulsion of Afghan refugees this time will further worsen the relationship between Pakistan and Afghanistan and put tremendous pressure on Afghanistan.&quot; Ma Jianfu told Southern Weekend reporters, Due to complex reasons, it will be difficult for Pakistan&#39;s expulsion work to proceed normally, and it may also trigger armed resistance and worsen the anti-terrorism and security situation in both countries. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Zeng Xiangyu analyzed that this is not the first time that the Pakistani government has expelled Afghan refugees. Pakistan only uses the refugees as a tool to put pressure on Afghanistan. Pakistan’s expulsion will not go too far, because some terrorist forces and extremist forces are trying to take advantage of this opportunity, so Pakistan’s move is likely to be “loud and rainy”, using large-scale propaganda to achieve the desired effect. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Pakistan&#39;s pressure strategy has been tried and tested time and time again.&quot; He said. As long as the relationship between Pakistan and Afghanistan is tense, Pakistan will expel the refugees &quot;until Afghanistan cannot bear it anymore and will give in to Pakistan.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On November 2, local time, the Ministry of Refugees and Repatriation of the interim government of Afghanistan stated that the Taliban government is currently providing assistance from multiple locations to families returning to Afghanistan from Pakistan. , and placed them in temporary camps. At the same time, some families with residential houses left the camps and went to the provinces where they lived, but there were also some families who did not have shelter and faced challenges in their lives. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The Taliban government also stated that it will try its best to find jobs for the returnees. However, according to World Bank data, Afghanistan&#39;s unemployment rate more than doubled from the time the Taliban took over to June 2023. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Many experts and scholars told Southern Weekend reporters that international sanctions on Afghanistan’s banking industry and the reduction of international aid to Afghanistan after the Taliban took over would lead to return Immigrants and refugees put enormous pressure on already limited resources. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 08 Nov 2023 17:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[当引进的高学历人才决定离开县城]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260140]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-08 16:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;On the morning of February 13, 2019, a city&#39;s talent service &quot;one-stop&quot; platform The window was opened, and applications for housing security for the first batch of imported talents in the city began to be accepted.

The city’s first batch of imported talents applied for housing security. (Visual China/Photo)&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In September 2023, when tens of millions of college graduates are flocking to job fairs, 27-year-old Lu Min I was worried about how to resign from the bureau. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;A year ago, she returned to her hometown of Henan through talent introduction and was admitted to the Human Resources and Social Security Bureau of a county in northern Henan. The reason for her choice is also very simple. Five years ago, she graduated from a 985 university in Shanghai with a bachelor&#39;s degree in human resources management. She changed many jobs but could not satisfy her parents. &quot;They felt that I must have an establishment.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;There is no need to repeat the enthusiasm of parents and students for public examinations and compilation examinations. In the past, it was a stereotype unique to certain provinces, but now it has become The other side that everyone dreams of reaching. But there is obviously more than one road leading to Rome. In addition to the conventional paths such as national examinations, public examinations, and selection and transfer, the relatively low-key talent introduction policy that has been in place for many years has attracted more and more attention. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Talent introduction, as the name suggests, is a recruitment method used by local institutions, usually in counties or urban areas, to recruit graduates with master&#39;s and doctoral degrees from well-known universities to work within the system. . Different from the administrative establishment provided by selection and recruitment of civil servants, talent introduction can only provide career establishment. Places that adopt the talent introduction method will omit the written examination link and promise candidates a certain talent subsidy, settling-in allowance, etc., which is intended to reflect the needs of the local area. The wise are like thirsty. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;After the opening of autumn recruitment in 2023, a new round of talent introduction has also begun. On various recruitment consultation websites, there are many announcements about remote counties offering high salary subsidies and hiring masters or even PhDs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;But at the same time, some young people who were attracted found that the balance between ideal life and reality was far more difficult than imagined. The problem is not new. If the county can still provide the &quot;one-stop-seen&quot; life that our parents did, it may not be able to match the talents they are vying to introduce. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In an article published in 2022, Fang Changchun, a professor at the School of Social Sciences at Nanjing University and director of the Employment Quality Research Center, once pointed out that various regions are actively recruiting highly educated talents. While being open-minded, we should also accurately select and use materials based on the actual economic and social development of the county, and treat the use of talents with caution. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“I was a little anxious to go ashore at that time”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Back to a Thursday in May 2022, Lu Min was attending tutoring She was in class and preparing for a teacher preparation exam when she got a call asking if she could participate in the county talent recruitment interview on Saturday. She signed up three months ago. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;There are only two days left before the interview. The day before the exam, Lu Min dug out the high school uniform from the bottom of the box - a black suit jacket, paired with a light blue shirt and dark suit pants, to make up a complete formal suit. In the evening, I made a phone call with a friend who was familiar with public examinations to improve my interview skills. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;This is a one-person interview. The examination room was a classroom in a local middle school. In the middle, there was a table prepared for interviewers, covered with a piece of white paper. Opposite, five examiners sat side by side, with timers placed beside the table. 10 minutes, the countdown has not started yet. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;It was hard to contain the tension, but fortunately, the temporary assault content came in handy. Similar to the exam preparation guide, among the three interview questions Lu Min encountered, the first question was pragmatic and asked about work attitude; the last two questions were pragmatic and asked what to do if agricultural products are unsaleable and how to properly place trash cans in the community. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Lu Min later reviewed his performance on that day and consciously answered well, &quot;I took the impact of the epidemic into consideration for the last two questions,&quot; but for the first question &quot;I should quote more materials, but I was nervous and forgot about it.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;This is not the first time Lu Min has sought to enter the system. After graduating from college in 2018, in order to meet her parents&#39; expectations, she took the civil service exam in her hometown city once, but stopped taking the written exam. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In the spring of 2021, Lu Min joined a private vocational and technical college as a teacher. This job has no establishment, but the teaching pressure is low and there are many vacations, which once made her very satisfied. However, her parents gave her an ultimatum and she must take the entrance examination in 2022. To this end, starting from February 2022, Lu Min &quot;cast his net everywhere.&quot; Most of the positions applied for were for teachers, but the only one who heard back was the one for talent introduction. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;One ​​week after the interview, Lu Min received the notification that he had successfully landed. She was happy at first, &quot;I can finally shut my parents&#39; mouths.&quot; But worries soon struck that this was not a job she really wanted after all. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;A year has passed, and Lu Min is always wandering around the personnel files. Compared with many other government agencies, this job is considered gentle. Except for the employment season, she only needs to send and receive three or four files a day. However, she was never sure whether this was her ideal life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Unlike Lu Min, Meng Qiping was already 35 years old before he successfully landed through talent introduction, and his life was full of frustrations and dissatisfaction. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In 2017, Meng Qiping graduated from a general state university in the United States with a science major. After returning to China for employment, he worked as a programmer and an IELTS training teacher. In 2020, before the &quot;double reduction&quot; was implemented, he went to the UK to study for graduate school. After graduating in 2022, he applied for a doctorate from a school in Malaysia. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Although at that time, going to Southeast Asia to study for a Ph.D. had become synonymous with &quot;mixed&quot; academic qualifications, the pressure of studying for a Ph.D. was still beyond his expectation, and &quot;the frustration was relatively strong.&quot; . In October 2022, Meng Qiping dropped out of school and returned to China again. This time, he set his sights on the hottest thing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;As a native of Kunming, recruiting talents from this province is his first choice. However, after several interviews, Meng Qiping discovered that the salary offered by Yunnan was very attractive. The competition is too fierce, and it is normal for &quot;about ten people to compete for one or two positions&quot;. After many failures, at the end of 2022, Meng Qiping decided to move to northern Guangxi to participate in a talent introduction interview in a certain county. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Recruitment information shows that the position Meng Qiping applied for at that time was a &quot;party and government talent position without restriction on majors&quot;, with a total of 10 positions open. On the day of the interview, he unexpectedly discovered that due to the epidemic, only 6 applicants came to participate. &quot;This means that as long as you attend the interview, you can get a job,&quot; Meng Qiping said happily. He didn&#39;t know it at the time, but this job would just add to his years of wandering life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On September 18, 2023, one month after resigning from the county’s Culture, Broadcasting, Sports and Tourism Bureau, Meng Qiping once again recalled the choice he made a year ago, admitting that “at that time Some are eager to get ashore.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;On October 13, 2023, a job fair in Mengzi City, Yunnan Province.

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;孟启平后来得知，和自己同批通过面试的五人，无一例外，都是硕士研究生，其中一人也有海外留学背景，两人被一起分到县文广体旅局，“刷新了该局历史上的职工最高学历”。而在豫北县城的陆敏提到，与她一起被引进的人，均毕业于985、211高校。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;2022年底，中&lt;span>;国社会科学院社会学研究所与社会科学文献出版社联合发布&lt;/span>;的《社会蓝皮书：2023 年中国社会形势分析与预测》中提到，2018-2021年间，越来越多大学生想要放弃北上广深等一线城市和二线城市，回到三四线中小城市、小县城、基层乡镇和农村工作。 2023年8月，教育研究机构麦可思研究院发布的2022届大学生返乡就业调查报告中也提到，毕业生返乡就业比例呈上升趋势，且近半数在体制内工作。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;人才流向县城体制内，正是地方政府所期待的。浙江省德清县，一个常住人口仅有65万的县城，2020年初的一次面试活动中，共有316位来自复旦大学、浙江大学、上海交通大学、哥伦比亚大学等国内外名校的硕博研究生参与，&lt;span>;最终只有23人通过，有望获得事业编制&lt;/span>;。官方宣传中，“人才竞争热度创历史新高”的解读被着重加粗。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;南方周末记者不完全统计，2023 年8月以来，有超过10个省份公布所在县市的事业单位人才引进计划，单次招聘开放岗位数量大多过百，其中，全日制硕士、博士毕业生为主要引进目标。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;“拿出一部分编制到外地高校院所去招人这件事，很早以前我们就在做，只是这几年人才引进的说法提得更明确了。”王蒙在西南某市市委组织部工作，据她回忆，2021年省里曾召开一次人才工作会议，专门将人才工作列为重点，并在省级、市级层面建立人才工作先行区。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;据王蒙观察，能够大力招才的县区通常都有一个主导产业或龙头产业，“像鞍山那样的，当地肯定会挑一些钢铁方面的专业人才，可以做研究，也有发展前景” 。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;小城市尽可能地展现它们的热情。王蒙所在的地区为研究生高层次人才提供了免费的人才公寓和购房补贴，工作达到5年以上，还有一笔现金奖励，子女就学、父母就医、免费体检等也都是配套福利。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;不过一个无法回避的事实是，人才引进火爆也有政策因素的驱动。南方周末记者检索发现，人才引进工作首次出现在公众视野，可以追溯到15 年前。 2008年，山东日照、河南鹤壁、江西抚州等地率先提出，开放部分事业单位岗位，引进高层次、高素质人才。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;两年后，2010年5月，第二次全国人才工作会议召开，《国家中长期人才发展规划纲要（2010-2020年）》下发。山西省太原市清徐县人事考试中心经济师张磊在论文中提到，政策影响下，全国各地的党政机关、事业单位也开始注重人才工作，并将之当成事业单位改革的一项重要内容开展。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;甘肃省永靖县委组织部一名工作人员向南方周末记者回忆，&lt;span>;他所在的县从2020年起开展人才引进，最初两年，每年能招聘两三次&lt;/span>;，往后次数就少了。 “下次什么时候说不上，有可能明年不招，有可能还招。编制是死的，单位缺人了肯定就招了。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;随着参与的县市增多，人才的“层次”也越码越高。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;2023年8月，山东省德州市下辖县级市禹城，一座以大禹治水而闻名的城市，发布了一则公告，计划引进6名博士到禹城市政府办公室、科学技术局、农业农村局、商务局等5个部门主管的市直单位工作。这是当地第一次专门针对博士开展人才引进。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;“以前我们人才引进的标准是，硕士研究生及以上就可以。”南方周末记者以应聘为名联系对方，负责此次招聘的人社部门工作人员在电话中解释，提高标准的原因“主要是想吸引人才”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;专为人才制定的选拔方式亦随之产生。与事业单位常规招考必需的初审、资格审查、笔试、面试等流程不同，工作人员介绍，博士引进，人社部门会在一到两个月内，不定期组织一批报名者集中面谈，经过双向选择即可。截至9月下旬，第一批报名者的集中面谈已经结束。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;“引进来的人才还是比较好用的。”王蒙介绍，其所在市的人才引进，会安排用人单位和求职者面对面沟通，“问你的意向、未来的发展方向，所有的都可以问，对一个人的评价和了解会更明确、更深入”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“经济发展水平在这儿摆着”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;更为丰厚的薪酬、更好的福利待遇，前述论文中，张磊提到，为了吸引人才，“送钱、送房、送户口”已然成为地方政府的“三板斧”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;作为人才引进工作的直接负责人，王蒙很清楚，许多高学历人才是冲着安家补助和现金奖励来的。疫情前，她所在的地区，人才流失率一直比较严重，要解决这个问题，福利待遇不可或缺，“毕竟每个地方都在打人才战”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;然而如愿捧上铁饭碗之后，高学历人才也可能会在实际工作中遭遇失落。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;入职前，孟启平特意留意过，县城为引进人才开出的“每月基本工资是四千，年底绩效是三万”，在当地而言，条件已相当不错。但直到2023年3月正式入职，他才知道，除了前五年每个月有4000元人才补贴外，月底到手的四千多，已经包括了每月1500元的预发绩效，在年底发放的实际绩效不超过一万。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;与孟启平一样，陆敏入职后的实际薪资也低于预期，“到手两千多，加上最近取消了考核，每月还降了三四十块”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;孟启平事后总结，“各个地方的薪资水平不太透明，相当于要进去之后才能了解到真实的薪资水平”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;大多数人才引进的县市能够开出的待遇条件有限。在前述电话咨询中，南方周末记者尚未询问目标薪资水平，仅是提起另一地级市，禹城市人社部门工作人员便补充说，“我们是县级市，和你预想的薪资待遇肯定是有所差别的，因为经济发展水平在这儿摆着。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;据该工作人员介绍，硕士研究生学历的引进人才转正后，每月到手工资约为4300元，如毕业于“双一流”高校，每月还有额外的1300元补助，博士学历的薪资待遇则要参照政府官网公布的文件标准。不过，南方周末记者未在官网上查询到相关文件的详细内容。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;“水土不服”也是杜琳的遭遇。 2022年，她通过人才引进，在甘肃中部一座人口不足50万的地级市获得了一份事业编的工作。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;杜琳本硕毕业于西部一所普通高校，是单位第一位通过人才引进招录的职工，同事大多为专科毕业。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;“多读了几年书，总被说年龄大，不好找对象。几个三四十岁的男同事还给我介绍了当地一个无业的男人，他们总是问我，你们聊得怎么样了。”这种十分传统的价值评价让杜琳感到不适。 &lt;span>;虽然她也来自另一个县城&lt;/span>;，但“家里人从来没说过让我尽快嫁人，也从来没说过年龄大了就别读书了”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;入职近两个月后，杜琳也没获得关于自己岗位的明确信息，“部门、办公室、工位，这些都没有”。她曾被安排去调试线上会议设备，会议开始后，一位男同事凑过来说，领导办公室需要打扫卫生，“要我先把做人学会”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;“单位本来就有保洁员。”杜琳猜测，或许使唤自己能给同事带来“优越感”，但往更深处探究，原因则可能是，高学历人才的入场给他们带去了职业焦虑。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;孟启平也有类似感受。他模仿起同事的语气：“唉，这个有什么困难？不用怕，有研究生在这顶着，研究生什么都会。”&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;过度教育之困&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;“什么都会”的研究生，可能正在做着自己最不擅长的工作。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;入职之初，杜琳和孟启平都在单位的综合办公室工作。这被视为磨砺新人的一种常规方式。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;在综合办公室工作的那段时间，孟启平和其他同事都需要遵从一张轮值表。轮到自己时，他要一大早赶到办公室，然后开始各种杂事：泡茶、订公车、跟拍、打印名牌。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;在孟启平看来，这份工作并不需要研究生。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;积攒的压力和迷茫，最终在五一期间一场篮球比赛结束后的深夜爆发了。凌晨一点多回到家，孟启平突然质疑起自己的多年苦读。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;“其实人才引进和通过其他方式考入事业单位的人，在提拔和工作内容上并没有什么差别。”作为人才引进的招聘方，王蒙并不否认，县城对人才的承载能力并不如想象的那般足够。曾有一名博士通过选调方式考入她所在的市区，但因为“干的是非常基础的工作”，与其预期不符，最终没能留住。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;在山东大学（威海）劳动经济研究所所长罗润东看来，这种受教育者从事与自己学历不匹配的工作，并导致其所学技能不能得到充分发挥的现象，便是过度教育。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;2010年发表的一篇论文研究中，基于社会综合调查数据CGSS，罗润东曾和南开大学经济研究所博士生彭明明一起，对不同类型单位受过高等教育员工的教育过度情况进行统计。结果显示，行政机关和事业单位的过度教育比例总体高于企业单位，而在企业单位中，国有或国有控股企业又高于外资企业和私营企业。与此同时，当其他条件相同，党政机关、事业单位、国有或国有控股企业等单位将进一步持续提高教育过度化的比例。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;时至今日，人人向往高学历、处处需要高学历的现象较论文发布时更为显著。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;2023年9月25日，当南方周末记者以某211大学硕士生身份向贵州省荔波县人才办咨询时，工作人员先是反复强调工作内容和所学专业不冲突，紧接着又透露，工作初期，单位为引进人才分配的工作一般都很轻松，像是收发文件或撰写材料。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;过去一年，陆敏自认不过是做着“螺丝钉”的工作。收发档案，对于人力资源管理专业毕业的她来说，只消很短时间就能上手，一年试用期很快过去，她站到了转正的拐角。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;最近又到招聘季，局里迎来了一批又一批面试者。有天，陆敏一眼认出，其中一名面试者是自己的高中同学。对方很快也认出了她，“你竟然在这里上班？”语气中的诧异掩饰不住。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;“对方在高中时成绩并不如我，这次是以研究生学历来报的名。”想到自己的本科学历，陆敏生出一种耻感。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;但更让她感到“低人一等”的，还是自己工作、生活的小县城。 “大学同学大都在上海。初高中的同学里，待北京的比较多，也有深圳、广州的。他们常常在朋友圈里晒，去哪里旅游了，周末又看了一个什么展。”而县城里，连购物中心都没几个。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;陆敏心想，“如果能考上研究生，我的人生或许可以打开另一番局面。”2023年9月18日，她瞒着父母递交了辞职信，专心备考研究生。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;8月，在入职四个月后，孟启平也决定离职。他了解过，当初上岸的6个人，有一人在入职前放弃。剩下5人中，除了自己，有一人也有离职的想法，还有两个人希望“考上公务员”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;他看到一种独属县城的人才困境。 “县城一方面需要人才去建设它，但人才真的来了以后，好像很多时候也发挥不了该发挥的作用。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;像是一个闭环，孟启平的下一步计划又变回了读博。他希望读完博士后，能在国内高校得到一份教职。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;（陆敏、孟启平、杜琳、王蒙为化名）&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 08 Nov 2023 16:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[男子有偿代骂被拘：Al正推动新业态进化，购买服务者是否担责？丨快评]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260134]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-08 15:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;近日，一起治安案件引发关注。据株洲警方通报，男子易某把在互联网上进行有偿“代骂”当成赚钱渠道，按照客户要求，通过微信和电话对特定对象进行人身攻击和侮辱，按照20—30元不等的价格收取费用，对受害人的工作生活造成严重影响。 2023年2月至今，易某凭借此类非法服务已获利3000余元。目前，易某已被行政拘留。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这不是“代骂”从业者第一次遭到处罚。 2023年8月，湖南长沙警方就依法将在网上发布“代骂”广告的李某东抓获归案，对其行拘。据警方调查，李某东以100元一天的价格帮助客户在指定社交平台上对他人进行网络言语辱骂，2022年10月至今已非法获利近万元。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“代骂”的风险在于被骂者可能会报警。 《中华人民共和国治安管理处罚法》第42条规定，“多次发送淫秽、侮辱、恐吓或者其他信息，干扰他人正常生活的”构成违法，处五日以下拘留或者五百元以下罚款；情节较重的，处五日以上十日以下拘留，可以并处五百元以下罚款。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;而在警方惩处“代骂者”不法行为的同时，也有几个问题值得深入考量。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;其一，代骂者已经违法，购买“代骂服务”的人是否需要负起法律责任？或者说，购买者花了这笔钱就可以“借嘴骂人”，从而达到“借刀杀人”的效果，还能免除自己的责任？从本案看，易某至少代替了一百个人辱骂他人，如果其中存在“严重后果”案例的话，那么出钱购买“嘴替”的人，倒成了不显山不露水的“幕后操纵者”，可以大喇喇地“买凶骂人”，这是因为每笔业务标的太小而不处理吗？ &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;《中华人民共和国民法典》规定，二人以上共同实施侵权行为，造成他人损害的，应当承担连带责任。教唆、帮助他人实施侵权行为的，应当与行为人承担连带责任。理论上，购买代骂服务的人才是侵权行为的源头，符合“教唆、帮助他人实施侵权行为”的认定标准。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;其二，“骂人”本身是个非常宽泛笼统的概念，存在如何界定的问题。哪些言语攻击属于骂人行为，又有哪些骂人行为属于人身攻击与侮辱从而涉嫌违法犯罪，其中尚有非常之大的区间分布，不宜一概而论。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;同样是广义上的“骂人”，遭遇不公之后的言语反击，与有组织有预谋的语言霸凌、侮辱显然不能相提并论，前者怎么说都称得上是语言上的正当防卫。而在“代骂服务”之外还有“代吵架服务”，这种“茶壶里的风暴”就不大容易涉嫌违法犯罪。顺着这个思路推下去，老派文人“知己知彼”“适可而止”“出言典雅”“以退为进”这些今天用来仍不过时的“雅骂”招数，恐怕就更难归类为触法言行了。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;不难想见的是，这些代骂者之所以被行拘，还是因为骂人言行符合人身攻击与侮辱的定义，构成对受害者的侵权，乃至涉嫌违法犯罪，而不是笼统的“骂了人”。移动互联网技术的发展，只是让本来就有的人身攻击、侮辱、污蔑诽谤行为变得更为便捷，甚至还让其变成了一款可以在平台上交易的“服务”而已。技术本身是中性的，有“夸夸服务”自然也会有“代骂服务”，这些“情绪需求”植根于人性深处。 “代骂服务”看起来是个新事物，但其内核却相当古老。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;其三，既然“代骂服务”是互联网技术加持下的新业态，那么技术进步恐怕还会催生出更新的“骂人”业态，这恐怕才是值得审慎考量与严加警惕的。以大语言模型ChatGPT为代表的生成式AI，带来的恐怕会是更为疯狂与难以想象的未来。可以设想的是，如今的“代骂服务”还只是真人在互联网上“接单开骂”，那假如是“AI代骂”呢？ &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;如今，AI训练的换脸、拟声、作文都已近乎以假乱真，完全可以在赛博空间克隆一个真人的数字生命，再凭借虚拟号码/账号介入现实。如果你被音色与现实生活中完全一样的真人的AI假人骂了，或是被完全虚拟的AI假人骂了，辱骂的内容又与你的个人信息高度吻合、涉事者又难以追踪的话，由此产生的各种麻烦与法律风险，肯定要比如今的真人代骂高出好几个数量级，给人格权的保护带来更大难题。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;例如你以为现实生活某个人骂了你，其实只是第三方购买了AI骂人服务，只是提取与使用了真人的音色与语音特征，你可能错误地与该真人产生实际的冲突，而这一切是某个第三方操纵的结果。这造成的问题在某种程度上与“视频换头术”是同构的。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;以近期爆火的“AI配音”为例，从特朗普到歌星泰勒•斯威夫特都可以开口用自己特色的音色讲中文普通话，“AI正在取代语音工作者”的前景并不遥远。如果这项技术也被拿来“代骂人”的话，后果势必比真人代骂更为耸动。设想有一天你的通讯工具收到了亲友乃至名人的“辱骂音视频”，光是精神损害恐怕都够你喝一壶的，消除误会也势必费时费力。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;因此，面对尚在苗头的“代骂服务”，及如火如荼的生成式人工智能，确实需要前瞻性地廓清其边界，界定哪些骂人行为侵权，哪些涉嫌违法犯罪，购买骂人服务者又是否需要担责。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 08 Nov 2023 15:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[雨季炮火，“三兄弟联盟”联军激战缅北]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260158]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-08 14:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;2023年11月2日，不断有新的逃难者来到果敢125难民营。受访者供图&quot;

&lt;p>;当天，果敢同盟军在社交平台上分享了一段战场视频。视频中，同盟军的红色军旗高高飘扬。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;10月27日，果敢同盟军、若开军和德昂民族解放军三支缅北民地武装结成“三兄弟联盟”，对缅北多地的缅军军事据点发动武装袭击。此后的十余天，果敢同盟军在社交媒体保持日更频率，高调公布战果。按照果敢同盟军的说法，缅北联军已占领120多个国防军营地，目前仍在持续向老街推进。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;而缅甸军政府则鲜少表态，只是回应称有三个政府控制区失控。11月2日，缅甸国防军宣布进入紧急状态，不日将发动反击。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“以往，民地武装往往是单独向缅甸政府军发起行动，即使有联军协助，也是分线孤军作战。但此次果敢同盟军的军事行动不仅有民地武装加入，也得到其余反军方力量的响应和支援，这将会导致战局更加复杂。”缅甸华人学者、华侨大学华侨华人与区域国别研究院助理教授亨凯向南方周末记者分析。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;目前，战火持续升级，缅北联军与国防军交火不断，并日渐围绕果敢形成对峙局势。连绵的枪炮声之下，数万缅北民众被迫逃离家园，难民人数持续增加。而与缅北隔河相望的云南边境小镇畹町，也被战火殃及。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;11月2日，中国外交部发言人呼吁各方立即停火止战，坚持通过对话协商，以和平方式解决分歧，避免事态升级，并采取切实有效措施，确保中缅边境安全稳定。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;2023年10月31日，果敢125难民营，志愿者正在卸物资。受访者供图&quot;

&lt;p>;阿仁是缅甸人，长期居住在云南昆明。10月25日，他从云南返回腊戌探亲，没想到到家后的第三天，就意外亲历了缅北冲突。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;而在缅甸果敢老街工作了13年的智祥似乎更加幸运一些。10月16日，智祥有事离开老街，恰好避开了。他本来计划28日返回，结果战事一起，地面交通陷入瘫痪，智祥没能回到果敢。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;10月27日凌晨4点开始，掸邦北部清水河、勐古、贵慨、滚弄、腊戌等多个地区同步遭遇缅北联军袭击，收费站、警察哨所、城市军队以及警察局均受到攻击。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“当天的枪炮声特别密集，感觉就像是在耳边爆炸一样，十分吓人。”阿仁回忆说，“怎么也没想到会遇到这样的事情，我感觉记事以来从来没有出现过如此紧张的情况。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;腊戌是缅甸北部掸邦首府，也是缅甸军方东北军区司令部所在地，“在城市中心山顶上，政府军连续十几天发射了多枚炮弹。”阿仁说，为了安抚民众，腊戌当地媒体曾特意发文提醒，这些炮弹主要是为了支援其他战区。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“1027行动”以其发动日期10月27日命名。《外交学者》杂志政治分析员Kyaw Hsan Hlaing估计，大约有2万缅北联军参与了此次行动。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“与果敢地区往年发生的冲突相比，此次军事行动不仅规模大，而且战略覆盖面更广更全。”亨凯指出，“三兄弟联盟”不仅对包括清水河在内的果敢战略要地发起攻势，而且同时攻打腊戌，试图牵制缅甸国防军，阻止其支援缅北。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;11月2日，缅甸国家管理委员会发言人佐敏吞回应，在多个地方连续交战之后，清水河、捧线、棒赛三个政府控制区失守。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;清水河位于果敢，捧线和棒赛则隶属于木姐，均是重要的中缅贸易口岸。三地紧邻中缅边境线，最近处不过一水之隔。据缅甸政府商务部统计数据，2023年4月至9月，缅甸与中国的边境贸易总额为18亿美元（约25亿新元），其中超过四分之一是通过清水河交易。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;缅甸民族地方武装表示，封锁从腊戌到清水河和木姐的道路，可以切断缅甸政府军进入掸邦北部的陆上通道。但对于缅北民众而言，这些陆上通道更是重要的生命补给线。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“果敢老街的物资大多依赖清水河，现在中国和缅甸的货物都进不来，大米的价格已经暴涨了逾三倍。”缅籍华人阿兰告诉南方周末记者，“原来一袋大米大概二三百人民币，现在已经涨到了1400元。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;由于担心后续买不到物资，阿兰的朋友想囤几箱泡面以备不时之需，但却无处购买。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;而在胶脉和腊戌，由于货物难以外运，反而出现了降价销售的情况。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;阿金一家在缅北胶脉从事养殖业。“胶脉有大量的养殖户，他们通常会将鸡蛋运到曼德勒和其他城市销售。由于现在公路被限制通行，鸡蛋只能在城内便宜销售。”阿金对南方周末记者说。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;2023年11月6日，果敢125难民营，身穿黄色马甲的工作者正在打扫卫生。受访者供图&quot;

&lt;p>;但在冲突更为激烈的其他战区，民众却难以在退和留之间从容选择。有的人不得不慌忙逃难，有的则被迫在惶恐中留下。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当冲突进入到第二周，缅北联军相继在滚弄以及果敢东山区、西山区连续作战，逐渐对老街形成包围之势。果敢同盟军单方面称，已拔除老街周边多个缅军据点。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“老街的局势越来越紧张。”智祥说。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;然而缅北民众却面临着难以逃离的困境。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“从老街回腊戌，需要经过清水河、滚弄、南扎拉和木邦，这些地方要么被缅北联军占领，要么正在交火。他们不是不想离开，而是没法离开，就怕路上更不安全。”阿兰告诉南方周末记者，她有很多朋友现在被困在老街，“他们很恐慌，但又别无选择”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2023年11月6日，联合国秘书长发言人斯特凡·杜加里克表示，自10月26日以来，缅甸北部已有近33000名男女老少流离失所。据缅甸当地媒体报道，仅仅在125果敢边境线附近设立的安置点，目前已收容逾12000人。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;智祥过去13年一直在果敢从事志愿服务工作。缅北冲突以来，他所在的服务机构和果敢联合青年会，共同承担起其中一处难民营的运转工作。短短十几天，难民营已经接收了1300多名难民。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在智祥发给南方周末记者的一段难民营视频中，红黄蓝绿各种颜色的简易帐篷，密密麻麻地排列在一片旷野之上，帐篷下则是咯人的石头和黄土。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“目前营区的供电还好，但我们最缺的是水和大米，而且现在米价越来越高，越来越难买。”智祥说。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;缅北联军和缅甸国防军连番激战之下，大量滚弄民众纷纷外逃。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;南方周末记者联系上一位曾在社交平台上求助的人士，她告诉南方周末记者，“已经安全撤离”，但其中的具体细节并不愿意谈及。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但即使安全撤离并不意味着可以免受战火之苦。一家人外出逃难，回来后发现房子被烧成空壳，过去这些年，智祥已见过太多类似场景。“只要是跑到偏远山区逃难，回来时基本上一无所有，我想这一次也不例外。”智祥说。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;2023年11月6日，果敢125难民营的早餐。受访者供图&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/08/123db821dd.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;810&quot;

&lt;h4>;“和平才最重要”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;在果敢地区工作13年，智祥经历了当地发生的多次冲突。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;与云南接壤的果敢自治区及其首府老街镇，曾长期是果敢同盟军的据点。2009年8月8日，缅甸政府军以果敢枪械修理厂制毒为由，派出30名警察，欲强搜该厂，遭拒绝后与果敢同盟军形成对峙。随后，果敢同盟军内部发生内讧，副司令白所成率部投靠缅甸政府。8月30日，缅甸政府军全面控制果敢，同盟军余部败退山林。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;此后，果敢同盟军先后于2015年和2017年连续发起两次军事行动，试图重新拿回果敢掌控权，但均被缅甸政府军瓦解。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;此次，缅北联军发表联合声明称，“1027”行动旨在联合所有革命组织推翻缅军人集团的独裁统治。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;10月29日，是缅甸军政府上台执政的第1000天。在亨凯看来，缅北民地武装选择这样的时机发动袭击并非偶然，而是基于战略目标的综合考量。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“2021年政变以后，缅甸掀起了声势浩大的反军方行动，政府军与反对力量冲突不断，缅北联军以&#39;反独裁&#39;的名义发动军事行动，更易于获得反军方势力响应。”亨凯分析，其最根本的目的，还是要重新夺回果敢。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;十余天来，缅北联军持续向果敢推进。其称，从10月27日到11月5日，三家民地武装已经夺取了120多个国防军营地。但缅甸军政府并未正面回应。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“缅北联军声势浩大，攻下这些据点不难，但想要守住却并不是一件容易的事。”亨凯指出，而且从目前来看，果敢同盟军拿下的大多只是城市周边的据点，很难说会对城镇管辖权产生多大影响。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;11月3日，缅甸军政府最高领导人敏昂莱警告，军方将向掸邦的少数民族地方武装组织发起反击。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“缅甸国防军仍具有压倒性的实力，但自2021年以来缅甸军政府始终四面受敌，甚至连首都内比都也曾遇袭。”亨凯分析。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2021年2月1日，缅甸政局突变，国家权力被移交给缅甸国防军总司令敏昂莱。部分反军方人士则随即成立民族团结政府和人民防卫军，采取军事行动对抗国防军，并不时和民地武装采取联合行动。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;据缅甸战略与政策研究院统计，自缅甸政变至2022年11月15日的21个月里，缅甸全国至少爆发了7855起冲突。其中，军方与少数民族武装组织交火4548次，与人民防卫军交火2267次，军方与少数民族武装组织和人民防卫军的联合交火达925次。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;此次缅北联军发起军事行动以来，缅甸各地已有14支“革命组织”宣布支持“1027行动”，其中部分宣布将加入战斗。另据缅甸当地媒体报道，在连续四天进攻后，克钦独立军联合当地人民防卫军，已于11月6日占领了实皆省高林镇。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“在缅甸军政府腹背受敌的情况下，战局究竟会走向何方，目前还很难说清。”亨凯说。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但对于饱经战乱之苦的缅北民众而言，讨论政治或许太过于遥远，稻田中待收获的水稻才更为重要。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“缅甸一年有三个季节——热季、雨季和凉季，眼下正是雨季水稻收割的季节。”阿仁说。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;腊戌一位农民告诉当地媒体，“过去两周，因为下雨，无法收割水稻，雨停后，战斗就开始了。由于经常听到飞机和武器声音，大家都不敢去田里收割，接下来也只能视情况而行。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在采访中，南方周末记者询问了多位受访者对这场冲突的看法，得到的回答几乎一致——不管谁打赢，对于我们老百姓来说，“和平才是最重要的”。&lt;/p>;

After retirement, he joined the Henan Elderly Cultural Development Foundation (hereinafter referred to as the &quot;Old Foundation&quot;) and was responsible for collecting private funds from the county. In the eight years he witnessed, people were able to get their principal and interest back as scheduled. Until August 2021, no more money could be withdrawn, and savers began to &quot;visit&quot; every now and then. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At dawn on October 24, 2023, the first guest welcomed into Zhang Shihe’s home was 69-year-old Zhang Fenglan. Six years ago, she deposited the 100,000 yuan she had saved for most of her life into the Lao Foundation and became a &quot;five-star member.&quot; Zhang Shihe is the person in charge. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhang Fenglan’s reminder voucher is not a passbook or an IOU, but two membership certificates. The issuing organization is the Old Foundation. If you deposit money to it, you will receive consolation money, which is interest. In Shangshui County, for every 10,000 yuan saved, you can get 570 yuan/year in consolation payment, with an annualized rate of return of 5.7%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“I thought I had saved my money in the safest place, but I never imagined that something like this would happen.” Zhang Fenglan sighed repeatedly to the Southern Weekend reporter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhang Shihe persuaded the other party in a low voice, saying that he was also a victim and felt very guilty for &quot;losing&quot; everyone&#39;s money. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He revealed that the entire Shangshui County involves more than 300 depositors, with a total of more than 41 million yuan in deposits. Looking at the entire Henan Province, the tentacles of the Old Foundation are everywhere. Several insiders of the old foundation revealed to Southern Weekend reporters that the old foundation may absorb as much as 500 million yuan in depositors&#39; funds in Henan Province, involving 18 offices in Zhoukou, Nanyang, Luohe, Luoyang and other cities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 20, 2023, the Henan Provincial Department of Civil Affairs mentioned in its reply to Li Yazhong and others’ letter of complaint that in June 2020, the Henan Provincial Department of Civil Affairs transferred Henan Herong Industrial Group Co., Ltd. ( (hereinafter referred to as &quot;Herong Group&quot;) suspected illegal financing-related materials were handed over to the Henan Provincial Public Security Department in the name of the Lao Foundation. The official website of the Henan Provincial Department of Civil Affairs also records that on July 28, 2020, the Lao Foundation was included in the list of social organizations with serious violations of laws and breach of trust. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many heads of old foundations confirmed to Southern Weekend reporters that under the guidance of the Henan Provincial Public Security Department, public security bureaus in many places have launched investigations into county-level old foundations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In late October, Southern Weekend reporters visited several counties and districts in Zhoukou and Luohe cities and found that the Lao Foundation used local political and private network resources to weave a huge deposit-absorbing network. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;How did a provincial public foundation “self-raise” such huge sums of money in the past ten years? Where do these huge sums of money ultimately go? &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;Network&quot; retired cadres and farmers&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;How to become a veteran foundation member? A &quot;Membership Instructions&quot; found by Southern Weekend reporters states that applicants fill out the membership application form, and after review and approval by the Old Foundation, register information and pay membership fees. After receiving the membership card, they become a formal member. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhang Shihe said that these membership fees will be returned to members when they expire (one year), and you can also receive consolation money by presenting your membership card to the issuing agency. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Membership fees are essentially deposits, and the amount is replaced by points on the membership card.

He has a monthly pension of more than 3,000 yuan, plus a front-end house, and an annual rent of more than 30,000 yuan. He and his wife cannot spend this money. How many. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He recalled that in the early days of the establishment of the Lao Foundation, Chen Zhihong, the person in charge in Shangshui County, often invited people to have dinner together to promote the Lao Foundation in order to build momentum. As a fellow villager, he even participated once. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Because it is a public foundation, I think there is no problem. Even if you deposit money in a bank for a fixed period, it doesn&#39;t have much money.&quot; He remembered Chen Zhihong motivating him like this, &quot;This foundation is managed by the Civil Affairs Department, so it can&#39;t be wasted.&quot; . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lu Zhiqiang hid the deposits of the old foundation from his children, not even his wife. &quot;If you tell them, they will stop it.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Guo Fenghua, 77, is the former head of the financial section of the Shangshui County Industrial and Commercial Bureau. She has deposited 250,000 yuan in the old foundation. She only learned about the old foundation through the introduction of a retired cadre from the Shangshui County Civil Affairs Bureau. &quot;I only knew that the interest rates were high and the certificates issued had the seal of the Civil Affairs Department, so I thought it was more reliable.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I didn&#39;t dare to tell my child at that time, for fear of exposing that my child was asking for the money. I wanted to save it so that I could hire a nanny when I get old.&quot; Guo Fenghua sighed, &quot;It&#39;s too late to regret it now. ”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to retired cadres in the county, the Lao Foundation has also extended its tentacles to the vast rural areas of Henan Province. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Shang Fugui, 70, is from Chengding Village, Guxiang Township, Linying County, Luohe City. He is responsible for helping the Lao Foundation collect deposits in the village. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He recalled to Southern Weekend reporters that at first the villagers saved little money, &quot;but because of the high interest rates, you saw me saving, I saw him saving, and word spread slowly.&quot; Some villagers even offered to give him cigarettes in order to do something for him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He absorbed 2.75 million yuan in funds, involving about 40 depositors, accounting for half of the village&#39;s population. There are also a few savers from other villages who are his relatives. Shang Fugui said that for every 10,000 yuan deposited, depositors can receive a condolence payment of 600 yuan per year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Actually, we are a small bank down there.” A head of the county-level office of the old foundation told a Southern Weekend reporter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Luohe, the old foundation showed the first signs of trouble. In October 2015, the Provincial Lao Foundation said that its funds were broken and gradually stopped local principal and interest payments. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Shang Fugui recalled that after the payment was stopped, the depositors became enemies with him. Seven years later, in October 2022, he was beaten once by villagers. &quot;Sometimes the tricycles are not dared to be released outside. They will poke holes in you and vent your anger.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Every Spring Festival, Shang Fugui and his wife would run to the city. &quot;What if I don&#39;t run away? They all gather at the door of my house to ask for money.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;A depositor has as many as 22 membership cards.

Their personal status provides credit endorsement to local people. Choosing such a group of &quot;hands-on&quot; is also a reason why similar foundations can always grow rapidly among the people. One of the &quot;mysteries&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The second floor of No. 8 Zhengxin Street, Shangshui County, Zhoukou City is the local office of the Old Foundation. When Southern Weekend reporters visited on October 23, the place was deserted and the door was locked. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhang Shihe said that there are five &quot;volunteers&quot; in the office, basically all retired cadres. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among them, Chen Zhihong is the person in charge of the Shangshui County Lao Foundation. He once served as secretary of the Party Committee of Tangzhuang Township in Shangshui County and deputy director of the Propaganda Department of the Shangshui County Party Committee. Zhang Shihe is the former vice president of a commercial bank in Shangshui County. The other two &quot;volunteers&quot; have served in the Shangshui County Finance Bureau and the Procuratorate respectively. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A former staff member of Weiji Township Government in Shangshui County told Southern Weekend reporters that he and Chen Zhihong are fellow villagers. I often sit at the same table with Chen Zhihong during meetings in the county. I am familiar with her, so I also saved some money. &quot;He is not like a liar, he is a very down-to-earth person.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In a criminal verdict obtained by Southern Weekend reporters, Yang Yiting, a &quot;volunteer&quot; at the Linying County Office in Luohe City, mentioned in his testimony that the old man When the foundation&#39;s Linying office was established, the director of the office, Xue Xiaoge, came to him and said that the provincial veteran foundation hoped to find a local cadre with prestige, popularity, and retirement to serve as the honorary director. &quot;The foundation is engaged in charity. Shang Qi had been retired at home for two years and wanted to do something.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xue Xiaoge confessed that Yang Yiting was the former political commissar of the Linying County Public Security Bureau and the honorary director. &quot;When there is an event, he takes part in it. He doesn&#39;t usually go to work.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to retired cadres from government agencies, former rural loan officers are also an important force for the old foundation to sink into the rural market. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;70-year-old Feng Junfu is a villager in Guzhuang Village, Daguo Town, Linying County, Luohe City. In 1975, he was elected as a loan officer of Daguo Township Credit Union by the Guzhuang Village Committee and worked there for 34 years until 2009. Get fired. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Feng Junfu said that township residents are accustomed to depositing funds in local rural credit cooperatives or township banks, and loan officers play the role of handling business for villagers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Loan officers must first be ideologically progressive, trustworthy by the people, and have no stains.” Feng Junfu told Southern Weekend reporters that there are 20 old foundation “volunteers” in Linying County, most of whom have worked as loan officers in township banks. , and people from all over the country regard them as their &quot;own people&quot; who are worthy of entrustment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In March 2013, Xue Xiaoge found Feng Junfu and showed him the approval document of the old foundation from the Henan Provincial Department of Civil Affairs, the foundation’s legal person certificate, tax registration certificate, organization code certificate, etc., saying that it was formal. organization and invite him to join. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“The most important thing is that we have depositor resources in our hands.” Feng Junfu told Southern Weekend reporters that he thought about staying in his old business and the process was roughly the same, so he readily agreed. In Guzhuang Village, Feng Junfu developed more than 50 villagers into members of the Lao Foundation and collected a total of 1.85 million yuan in savings. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Provincial Veterans Foundation stipulates that for every 10,000 yuan taken in, 300 yuan will be set aside for &quot;volunteers&quot; and another 200 yuan will be used for office expenses of the county and district offices. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Origined from the Henan Song Qing Ling Foundation&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Tracing back to the source, the old foundation is inextricably linked to the Henan Soong Ching Ling Foundation (hereinafter referred to as the &quot;Henan Song Qing Ling Foundation&quot;). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As early as 2005, the Henan Song Foundation collected deposits from villagers in the name of public welfare medical insurance. (See Southern Weekend’s September 2011 series of reports on “Where is the Money of China’s Most Fundraising Charitable Organization—Who Controls the Henan Soong Ching Ling Foundation”)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In February 2013, the old foundation officially It was established and Lu Dawei was appointed as the president. According to the Henan Provincial People&#39;s Government website, Lu Dawei served as assistant to the governor. In addition, Southern Weekend reporters learned from the Henan Song Foundation website that he is also the vice chairman of the Henan Song Foundation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A county-level person in charge of the old foundation revealed that the management method of the old foundation is under the leadership of the president, with the secretary-general taking responsibility. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The person in charge told Southern Weekend reporters that Guo Jianxin is the secretary-general of the Old Foundation and is responsible for the overall work, while the deputy secretary-general Huang Yuejun is responsible for specific work. &quot;Huang Yuejun turned out to be from the Song Foundation. Basically, we follow the management style of Song Foundation, otherwise we wouldn’t be able to get this thing done.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In interviews with reporters from Southern Weekend, we found that most of the county-level directors of the old foundations had working experience in the Henan Song Foundation. After the Henan Song Foundation&#39;s savings-absorbing business ceased, Guo Jianxin and Huang Yuejun recruited these people. “In the past, we were all familiar with the business at the Song Foundation. Huang Yuejun gave us advice and introduced us to the old foundation,” the person in charge said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 30, a reporter from Southern Weekend contacted Huang Yuejun by phone. The other party said that he had left the Lao Foundation at the end of 2015 and was currently residing in a nursing home in Sichuan Province. He did not know much about the past and then hung up. Disconnect the phone. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu Cuiyun was originally a depositor of the Henan Song Foundation. After the Song Foundation ceased its deposit-taking business, she withdrew the original 100,000 yuan from the Song Foundation and transferred it to the old foundation. Then save another 50,000 yuan every year until 450,000 yuan. &quot;Generally (every year) I don&#39;t ask for the principal, I get the interest, but I add some money to make up 50,000 and deposit it again.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Left-hand foundation, right-hand open Company&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Tianyancha shows that the Elderly Foundation is located in Zhengzhou City, Henan Province, and its purpose is to &quot;promote the development of social welfare, culture, sports, education and other undertakings for the elderly in Henan Province.&quot; Access to the foundation’s official website is currently closed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporters obtained a reply from the Henan Provincial Department of Civil Affairs on the establishment and registration of the Henan Provincial Elderly Cultural Development Foundation (Yu Min Han [2013] No. 47). According to the &quot;Foundation&quot; According to the provisions of the Management Regulations, after review, the old foundation, which was donated a total of 4 million yuan as the original fund by Guo Jianxin, meets the conditions for establishing a public foundation. It is hereby approved to register and obtain the legal person status of the foundation in accordance with the law. Its business supervisory unit is Henan Provincial Department of Civil Affairs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In November 2023, Southern Weekend reporters repeatedly contacted the Henan Provincial Department of Civil Affairs to verify many issues regarding the old foundation, but no one answered the relevant calls. Inquired through &quot;12345&quot;, but still no reply after waiting for many days. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For many savers, they are willing to deposit money in the foundation. On the one hand, they trust the &quot;volunteers&quot;, and on the other hand, they see the business scope on the foundation&#39;s legal person registration certificate. On this certificate issued by the Henan Provincial Department of Civil Affairs, the business scope reads &quot;raising social funds in accordance with the law and carrying out elderly cultural activities such as loving and helping the elderly.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the eyes of many savers and &quot;volunteers&quot;, being able to &quot;raise social funds in accordance with the law&quot; means that they can legitimately accept deposits. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A search shows that many foundations do mention &quot;raising social funds in accordance with the law&quot; in their business scope. For example, the business scope of the Henan Province Yellow River Cultural Foundation is “raising funds in accordance with the law, rescuing cultural heritage, and establishing cultural undertakings”; the business scope of the Henan Province Youth Entrepreneurship and Employment Foundation is “raising funds in accordance with the law, subsidizing youth entrepreneurship and employment, and conducting research on youth entrepreneurship, etc. &quot;Related social charity activities&quot;; the business scope of the Henan Province Old District Construction Foundation is &quot;raising funds in accordance with the law and supporting poverty alleviation&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lawyer Zeng Jie of Guangdong Guangqiang Law Firm told Southern Weekend reporters that there is an essential difference between raising funds and deposits. Deposits mean a commitment to guarantee principal and interest. “The foundation can absorb funds from the society within its business scope. However, returns cannot be promised, and projects that repay principal and interest are not allowed.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He explained that deposit business requires a formal banking license. The old foundation used consolation money instead of interest without approval, which is a disguised form of absorbing savings. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;The business scope on the registration certificate makes depositors and volunteers think it is &quot;natural&quot; to save money here.

(hereinafter referred to as &quot;Herong Group&quot;) bears joint liability for compensation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What is the relationship between Herong Group and the Lao Foundation? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As the secretary-general of the Lao Foundation, Guo Jianxin is also the chairman of Henan Herong Elderly Care Industry Group and was once the major shareholder of Herong Group. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tianyancha shows that Herong Group was established in 2010 and is an enterprise mainly engaged in business services. On March 15, 2010, Guo Jianxin, as the major shareholder, participated in 90% of the shares for the first time. Another shareholder, Wang Shuling, is also a member of the board of directors of the Lao Foundation and holds 10% of the shares. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;To put it bluntly, Herong Group and the Lao Foundation are one and the same to the outside world, but in reality they are the same.&quot; A person close to Guo Jianxin told Southern Weekend reporters that there are people under the Lao Foundation and Herong Group. Division of labor, top management is a group of people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The registered office address of Herong Group is also the same as that of the Old Foundation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On March 5, 2013, the Lao Foundation and Herong Group officially signed a letter of authorization. The Lao Foundation will authorize Herong Group to invest in projects with the raised funds to ensure the maintenance and appreciation of the funds. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;An investigation by Southern Weekend reporters found that in order to avoid supervision, most of the private funds absorbed by the old foundation went through personal accounts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As can be seen in a criminal verdict, the financial personnel of the Provincial Veterans Foundation are Zhang Xiaodan and Wang Jie. Wang Jie is responsible for receiving funds (he resigned in September 2015), and Zhang Xiaodan is responsible for disbursing funds. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhang Xiaodan mentioned in his testimony that the Provincial Veterans Foundation has bank cards in its offices in various counties and districts. The bank card account names are all the names of provincial and ministerial personnel, and most of the funds are transferred through China Construction Bank. Yes, a small part is transferred through ICBC and Postal Savings Bank of China. After the various offices in the county and district paid dues, Wang Jie transferred the money to the Herong Group&#39;s account. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Wang Jie swiped directly from the POS machine at the foundation headquarters and transferred it to the account given by Herong Group.&quot; Zhang Xiaodan saw Wang Jie transfer like this with his own eyes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhang Xiaodan said that the foundation transfers the dues transferred from each office to Herong Group. &quot;This is the case every day.&quot; Any money received is transferred to the company and transferred to his personal bank card. superior. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Judging from the available annual reports of the old foundation, from 2014 to 2016, the donation income was 300,000 yuan, 460,000 yuan, and 270,000 yuan respectively, and the corresponding public welfare expenditures were 25,000 yuan. Ten thousand yuan, 220,000 yuan, 360,000 yuan. But by 2017, both donation income and public welfare expenditures were 0. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This means that the huge &quot;membership dues&quot; of the old foundation did not go through the foundation&#39;s public account, but were transferred privately through personal bank accounts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;If a lawsuit is filed and we check the old foundation&#39;s public account, we will find that our money is not in the account. The old foundation&#39;s public account only accepts donations. Depositors&#39; money cannot be added to it. Even if it’s a donation,” a county-level head of an old foundation told a Southern Weekend reporter. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Huge sums of money flow into real estate&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;From a province-wide perspective, the difficulties faced by the old foundation in repaying funds are concentrated in the second half of 2021. But there are early signs of bank-run difficulties. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2014, guarantee companies and investment companies in Henan Province went bankrupt on a large scale. &quot;As soon as they closed down, the old foundation was also affected.&quot; An insider close to Guo Jianxin told Southern Weekend reporters that one year after the establishment of the old foundation, the capital chain began to break. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The source revealed that from August to September 2015, depositors began to withdraw money from the county-level offices of the Old Foundation on a large scale. &quot;Not only the customers panicked, but the directors and volunteers of the Old Foundation offices also panicked.&quot; . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A person in charge of a county-level office recalled that in October 2015, Guo Jianxin, the head of Herong Group, said at a meeting with county-level leaders that the company had debts and the funds could not be paid temporarily. , let everyone go back and wait, and protect themselves first. &quot;We didn&#39;t tell the depositors when we got back. We thought it would be fine after a while.&quot; In order to repay the interest to the depositors, we also asked relatives and friends for help, did not hesitate to borrow money, and even sold the house, paying more than 1 million yuan in interest to the depositors. It wasn&#39;t until 2021 that he couldn&#39;t survive anymore, then he confessed to savers and stopped paying interest. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;There is no way, in order to encourage depositors to continue depositing. If we stop (payment), we will have to go to (jail). Will ordinary people be willing to not pay interest?&quot; The person in charge of the office said that if we continue to do so, Those who went down were paupers and were in debt. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On February 20, 2023, Herong Group issued the &quot;Explanation on the Inability to Redeem the Funds Raised by the Henan Elderly Cultural Foundation on Time&quot;, saying that it held a meeting to study and decide that the payment will be made from the end of February 2023. 10%-15% of the funds will be paid, and 20%-25% of the funds will be paid at the end of February 2024; 30%-35% will be paid in February 2025, and the rest will be paid at the end of 2025. However, the above promises have never been fulfilled. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Where did the money go? This is the mystery lingering in the minds of savers and &quot;volunteers&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yi Jiadong is the legal representative of Herong Group. He confessed in a criminal verdict that &quot;Herong Group invested in two real estate projects in Mengzhou City in Jiaozuo and Yuanyang County in Xinxiang , invested in an apartment project for the elderly in Zhengzhou Port District, and also invested in a real estate project in Shangqiu City. All the social funds raised by the Lao Foundation were used in these projects.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among them, the Zhengzhou Port District project is Herong International Health Care Demonstration Park (hereinafter referred to as &quot;Health Care Park&quot;) is considered to be the benchmark project of Herong Group. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Public information shows that Kangyangyuan is located at the southwest corner of the intersection of Yingang Avenue and Ruyun Road, Airport District, Zhengzhou City. The total land area is 41,398.22 square meters, the total construction area is 76,754.40 square meters, and there are 2,000 designed beds. It mainly constructs 6 elderly apartment buildings, 1 comprehensive service building, 1 elderly research center building, and 1 elderly medical care center building. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Feng Chunlai is the head of a county-level office of the Lao Foundation. On September 15, 2022, he was elected as the director of Kangyangyuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He revealed to Southern Weekend reporters that the elderly care projects in the port area are positioned as high-end and have received the attention of many local leaders. There is a lot of room for imagination in the future. In addition to construction subsidies, bed subsidies, and nursing subsidies, the land price also has advantages compared with other investors. &quot;I heard that the land price in Zhengzhou Port District cost more than 2 million yuan per acre, but here it was only a few hundred thousand. At that time, the house price was 10% per year. growth, this alone will not make us lose anything.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, its construction was not smooth. Feng Chunlai said that the construction of Kangyangyuan started in 2016, but due to environmental problems such as dust and noise, the superior authorities asked it to stop construction. It was not until December 18, 2019 that the first phase of the park was successfully opened. According to the Henan branch of CCTV, Lu Dawei and Guo Jianxin also delivered speeches at the opening ceremony. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Feng Chunlai revealed that the main construction of the nine buildings of the senior care project in Zhengzhou Port District was completed in 2018, but due to financial constraints, there has been no renovation. At the beginning of 2019, eight county-level offices under the old foundation established project promotion teams to continue to collect deposits from the society and provide loans to renovate Buildings 5 ​​and 4. The remaining seven buildings have not yet been renovated due to funding problems. &quot;If we don&#39;t renovate the building, this place will collapse long ago.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Today, about 80 elderly people live in the No. 5 complex. However, as of now, the Kangyangyuan has not yet been inspected and has not obtained a business license. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Multiple people familiar with the matter confirmed to Southern Weekend reporters that in the second half of 2022, Guo Jianxin and several company managers were arrested by the public security organs for involvement in other cases. Subsequently, the offices of the Old Foundation and Herong Group were moved from No. 8 Shangdu Road, Zhengdong New District to Kangyangyuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;Now almost no one is working in the Old Foundation and Herong Group. They come if they have something to do, but they don&#39;t come if there is nothing. They basically go back to their homes.&quot; An insider of the Old Foundation said that No. 5 in Kangyang Garden The second floor of the complex building was originally the office space of the bosses, but now it is hard to find anyone. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 30, a reporter from Southern Weekend contacted an external relations director of Herong Group as an investor. He said that Kangyangyuan currently still has debts of more than 200 million yuan, of which the construction work is in arrears. The team&#39;s project payment is less than 100 million yuan, and the other more than 100 million yuan is funds collected from some elderly customers before the epidemic and needs to be refunded. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Feng Chunlai said that Kangyangyuan currently has 30 employees and spends 200,000 to 300,000 yuan a month. The largest expense is water and electricity bills. Although we can collect 3,700 yuan per month from each elderly person, &quot;it&#39;s basically not enough, and we are trying every means to delay and owe money.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Can this retirement apartment make money to replenish the principal of the old foundation’s depositors? They can&#39;t think that far ahead. At the moment, the operations here are barely surviving on the money of the elderly living in retirement apartments. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(At the request of the interviewee, Zhang Shihe, Zhang Fenglan, Lu Zhiqiang, Guo Fenghua, and Liu Cuiyun are pseudonyms in the article.)&lt;/p>; &lt;p >;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 08 Nov 2023 12:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[消失的课间十分钟，学校何以成樊笼：“绝对安全”发生学丨快评]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260132]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-08 11:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;In response to the &quot;disappearing ten minutes between classes&quot; for primary and secondary school students in some places, the Ministry of Education stated that it will resolutely correct it to &quot;ensure The practice of simply restricting students’ necessary recess and activities on the grounds of “student safety”. Subsequently, some schools began to respond, such as media reports: The bell rang, and Dang Xinlong, the vice principal of Shanhaitian Experimental Primary School in Rizhao, Shandong Province, kicked out the students who were still in the classroom. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, this chronic disease has been infiltrated for a long time, is widespread and deep, and I am afraid it cannot be cured by a single statement. Article 8 of the &quot;School Protection Regulations for Minors&quot; that will be implemented on September 1, 2021: Schools shall not set up management measures that infringe on students&#39; personal freedom, and shall not impose any restrictions on students&#39; legitimate communication, games, or activities during recess and other non-teaching time. Unnecessary restrictions are placed on freedom of speech and behavior such as classroom activities. The target is the &quot;disappeared ten minutes between classes&quot;. The problem is that it is difficult for students to make their own decisions. No school believes that it is &quot;unnecessary&quot; to restrict students from leaving the classroom, the teaching building, and the playground during recess. So, the problem remains to be solved. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Beiqing.com recently reported that a parent said: If children want to leave the classroom during recess, they can basically only go to the toilet and get water. They are not allowed to talk loudly or run or jump on the way; some &quot;loose&quot; schools , the child will be allowed to walk in the corridor and cannot go up or down stairs or to the playground; in more serious cases, the child can only stay in the corridor of his own group and cannot cross the boundary. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another media reported in July this year that in Beijing, primary schools generally strictly limit the scope and intensity of students’ recess activities. The reporter randomly visited 27 schools in the central city and found that at least more than 20 schools have strict restrictions on students’ recess activities. restrictions on activities during the period. In addition, some schools in Zhengzhou, Henan, Baoding, Hebei and other places have adopted similar regulations, including not being allowed to leave the teaching building, not leaving the classroom, and not allowed to speak loudly or play around inside or outside the classroom. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When I was a child born in the 70s and 80s, I could go out for ten minutes between classes to skip rope, play shuttlecock, hopscotch, play freely and even chase each other, letting go of my nature; outdoors, in the playground, be quiet or active No matter what, it is always suitable, with the blue sky above your head, your feet on the earth, let the sun hit your face, let the breeze blow on your face, and be close to nature, which can instantly rejuvenate and heal the body and mind, and also cultivate simple, strong and resilient character and values. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;And now, while restricting or even prohibiting children from leaving the classroom, leaving the teaching building, or going to the playground for even ten minutes between classes, they still naively ask: Why are our children so mentally fragile? Why are our boys so fragile? A general lack of masculinity? Isn&#39;t this funny? How can we become strong physically and mentally if we are not even allowed to chase, play and fight? Where does masculinity come from? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;How did this distorted philosophy and practice come to be? On June 1, 2021, the Director of the Department of Physical Health and Art Education of the Ministry of Education responded to CCTV: &quot;We are afraid that students will be easily injured once they move. Now all schools put safety first... This can also be said to be a failure to eat due to choking. .&quot; Viewed in this way, the pursuit of &quot;absolute safety&quot; and its mechanism are worthy of analysis and reflection. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First of all, some parents have problems and believe that the school should be responsible for any personal injury to their children while in school. This imposes unlimited liability on the school. Not to mention that schools can’t do it, parents themselves can’t do it either. Theoretically, there is no one in the world who is more concerned about the safety of their children than parents, but under the care of parents, there are endless incidents of children being injured or even killed. No one wants to see something like this happen, but the world itself contains various known and unknown risks, and we cannot make anti-human demands on schools. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Furthermore, identifying risks, preventing risks, responding to risks, and coexisting with risks are an integral part of everyone&#39;s life, and they are also the basic education that every child must learn to grow up. Very young children do not know what risks are. Of course, they must be kept away from risks and isolated as much as possible. However, children are constantly growing and need to learn the skills to identify, prevent and respond to risks as they grow. This is the most important survival skills education. In a way, it is much more important than knowledge education. And so many schools actually succumb to the ideas of some parents of students and strive to build schools into an absolutely safe space that is isolated from any risks. To this end, they do not hesitate to suppress children&#39;s love of freedom and love of play. This is anti-education in itself and also In vain. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Secondly, there will always be some weird parents who want to blackmail the school financially when their child has an accident at school, even though it is clearly not the school’s responsibility. But this is not the crux of the problem. The key lies in how schools, education authorities, public prosecutors and law respond. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If these three parties can handle the matter according to its merits and legal principles, it will not be the responsibility of the school. The school will not shoulder the responsibility, nor will it be allowed to the school. He Xini will resolutely fight back those who mess around. In this way, righteousness can rise and decent values ​​and correct incentives can be established. Does the school still need to engage in &quot;absolute security&quot; that is anti-education and anti-human? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Obviously it was not the school’s responsibility, but due to the parents’ unreasonable fuss, the school had to compensate the loss on its own or under the pressure of superior departments. This is a bad incentive for some parents who have evil intentions or like to shirk responsibility. In order to avoid another hemorrhage, the logical approach for schools and education authorities is to restrict children&#39;s freedom of movement, confine them to the smallest possible space, and approach the &quot;absolute safety&quot; that isolates all risks. This is the root of the problem. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To a certain extent, this is a social issue and a conceptual issue: children who cry have milk to drink. Whoever has a louder voice and can make more noise will get greater benefits. This phenomenon is still prevalent in public opinion and in all walks of life. &quot;I am weak and I am reasonable&quot;, &quot;I am making trouble and I am justified&quot; and &quot;I am loud and I am justified&quot; have become unspoken rules. Pretending to be weak, being miserable, and using the weak to bully the strong has created another jungle. The children locked up in the classroom are just another group of victims of this jungle law. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;获取更多RSS：&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 08 Nov 2023 11:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[记者节之思：新闻理想的坚守与开拓]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260074]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-08 10:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;The annual Journalists’ Day is here. This is also the time for reporters who are working non-stop and running around all year round to stop and reflect. , an important moment for self-examination. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Today&#39;s world is full of chaos, the century-old changes are accelerating, the media field is deeply integrated and reconstructed, instability and uncertainty factors are significantly increasing, internal and external factors are stirring in the hearts of journalists... At this moment, Journalists&#39; Day, Perhaps each of us journalists should ask themselves the question: Do you still have journalistic ideals? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For a journalist, the news ideal is the &quot;beacon light&quot; that guides the direction; the news ideal is the &quot;engine&quot; that drives forward; the news ideal is the &quot;ballast&quot; &quot;Stone&quot; has the function of calming the mind; news ideal is the &quot;regulator&quot; and has the function of prompting and warning. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, today, the traditional journalism industry is facing an unprecedented industry shock: the circulation of newspapers and periodicals and radio and television ratings have declined, and the influence of the media has declined; the media industry has operating difficulties, and the income of news practitioners has decreased. ; The number of people leaving their jobs has increased, and people quitting the industry have been heard from time to time; the number of enrollment in journalism and communication majors in colleges and universities has been reduced, and the employment situation of graduates has become tighter... There is no shortage of comments on the Internet about candidates who plan to apply for the journalism and communication major. Although it is not without bias, This is by no means groundless. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the founding words of &quot;Xiangjiang Review&quot;, Mao Zedong enthusiastically asked: &quot;What is the biggest problem in the world? The biggest problem is the problem of food.&quot; When the traditional journalism industry is climbing up and over the hurdles, a group of people who are confused and emotionally anxious have emerged. Psychological Inevitability – Will Traditional Journalism Die? Is there a future for journalism? Do we still need journalistic ideals? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As long as we carefully study the history, reality and future development trends of journalism, we will find that traditional journalism will not disappear. Journalism still has its own future, and we still need journalistic ideals. This is because: From the perspective of the origin of journalism, news originates from people’s curiosity. As long as people’s curiosity does not die, journalism will not disappear. From the perspective of the evolution of journalism, although the carrier of news is constantly changing, the functional role of journalism has not disappeared. However, compared with the traditional ways of reading newspapers, listening to radio, and watching TV in the past, people now obtain news in a different way. It’s just a new carrier such as a mobile phone. From the perspective of audience needs, news focuses on meeting people&#39;s communication needs. As long as people&#39;s communication needs exist, the demand for journalism will always exist. From the perspective of journalism production, the authoritative news, in-depth reports, news reviews, elegant programs and other products provided by traditional media cannot be replaced by the vast number of new media and self-media. Therefore, traditional journalism is unlikely to disappear in any of the above senses. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since it is impossible for traditional journalism to disappear, it is impossible for journalists to disappear. The ideal of journalism will inevitably accompany and advance together with journalists. Otherwise, we will lose our way and lose our way. Without motivation, lack of soul, and chaos, you will be at a loss, useless, muddle along, and do nothing. Therefore, in such a special context of the times, each of us journalists must still have journalistic ideals in mind, promote journalistic ideals, adhere to journalistic ideals, and practice journalistic ideals. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Always have a loyal heart. Loyalty means that as a journalist, don’t ask what the country has done for me, but ask what I have done for the country; loyalty means not being confused in the face of major events, not wavering at critical moments, and being able to withstand various complex situations and problems. The test; loyalty means being indifferent to fame and wealth, willing to work as a coolie, working hard, sweating, and traveling thousands of miles for journalism, and striving to become an excellent journalist. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Always maintain a keen sense. Sensitivity is an essential quality for professional journalists. Only journalists who are sharp-minded, have unique vision, are good at seeing the subtleties, react quickly, and have a pen with a sharp eye can effectively enhance the dissemination, guidance, influence and credibility of news and public opinion work. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We must always practice seeking truth. The world-famous journalist Farage once said: &quot;A reporter&#39;s duty is to reveal the truth.&quot; In an era of widespread media communication, despite the excess of news information, real news is always valuable. We should always maintain the spirit of truth-seeking, practice truth-seeking skills, and provide the public with truth, true knowledge, true feelings, and truth in a timely and rapid manner in the turbulent world of massive information. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Always hold the ruler of justice. Some people say: &quot;The reporter&#39;s pen contains countless fortunes, reputation and reputation, loyalty and villainy, right and wrong, and life and death.&quot; This shows how heavy the reporter&#39;s pen is. Therefore, we reporters should be very clear about why we write, what we write, how we write, and to what extent we write. We must always grasp the yardstick of &quot;fairness&quot; and must not be influenced by some kind of power, money, or interest relationship. Those pens soaked in grease and booze can&#39;t possibly do them justice. This is why we need to always be in awe of &quot;justice&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the occasion of Journalists’ Day, I wish every journalist’s journalistic ideals to be evergreen and never wither! &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(The author is from the media in Hebei)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;• &lt;span>; 163.com)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 08 Nov 2023 10:25:04 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
