The amount of assistance is the difference between the actual charges for staying in a nursing home after deducting the minimum living security allowance and two subsidies for persons with disabilities that the elderly have received. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to statistics from a few years ago, there are more than 40 million disabled or semi-disabled elderly people in China, many of whom are also suffering from dementia, such as Alzheimer&#39;s disease. As the population ages, this number will only continue to increase. Data from the Ministry of Civil Affairs shows that as of the end of 2022, there were 280.04 million elderly people aged 60 and over in the country, accounting for 19.8%; among them, there were 209.78 million elderly people aged 65 and over, accounting for 14.9%, a year-on-year increase of 0.9 and 0.7 percentage points respectively. Increases of 12.68 million and 9.22 million. Due to China&#39;s sluggish fertility rate, the number of newborns has almost halved in six years, and the rate of social aging is quite fast. This has led to many social problems that require our serious concern. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Based on the age and physical and mental conditions of the elderly, we can sort out the specific problems they face according to the timeline. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First of all, when the elderly are still &quot;younger elderly&quot;, their physical condition is generally better, and their ability to live, work and study has not significantly declined; there are also a few elderly people who have always been in good health and mentality. These two types of elderly people do not need or need the care of young adults for the time being and do not pose any social problems. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, as we get older, our physical functions and mental abilities will continue to weaken. A considerable number of elderly people will be driven by the instinct of seeking life and hating death, and they will turn to health regimens that claim to help health and longevity. They are particularly keen on health care products and health care equipment. It is not uncommon for people who used to be very frugal and spend two cents of a penny to suddenly turn into buying and selling or even spend a lot of money; there are also a considerable number of elderly people who long for the warmth and affection of family. Although I have no children or my children are not around, I feel extremely lonely. Under the meticulous care and emotional attack of the sales staff, it is very refreshing to spend money. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This &quot;elderly economy&quot; is essentially a careful hunt for the elderly and &quot;defrauds the elderly economy.&quot; The public prosecutor and the law should show their teeth and carry out a powerful crackdown to protect the legitimate rights and interests of the elderly. Children should also care about their parents&#39; mental and emotional needs, make more phone calls and spend more time with them; if possible, try to live with their parents so that parents can enjoy the rewards of raising children in their later years, so as to avoid the situation of &quot;the children want to be raised but the parents don&#39;t wait&quot; regret. In this regard, some young people may make reasonable remarks, such as &quot;small family&quot;, &quot;independent space&quot; and &quot;border&quot;. If you have never accepted or asked for a large amount of financial support from your parents as an adult, and you have repaid your parents for their upbringing financially and emotionally, you may have the confidence to say this. But it is unjustifiable if you receive a large amount of financial support from your parents as an adult and then refuse to fulfill reciprocal responsibilities. According to natural law and customary law, parents have the right to assert their own rights. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Secondly, now is the era of smartphones and mobile Internet, and many public transportation services, government services, and convenience services have become online and digital. A considerable number of elderly people have been left far behind in this era and have become &quot;digitally disabled groups&quot;. They do not use mobile phones or use simple-function elderly machines, cannot understand how to use those apps, and do not know how to make electronic payments. On the one hand, the government and enterprises should reserve non-digital service channels for the elderly and provide them with guidance in a conspicuous way; on the other hand, the platform should demonstrate social responsibility and launch an &quot;aging-friendly&quot; APP version to make the operation quick, simple and convenient. Older people get started. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Children should have patience and love for their digitally disabled parents, teach them to use the apps they need, or provide regular guidance and help, just like your parents patiently taught you ancient poems over and over again when you were a child. Like arithmetic, this is about feedback and feedback. In addition, parents should be alert to prevent telecommunications and network fraud, and should &quot;not give any personal information, do not give money, and do not cooperate with the other party in any operation.&quot; They should inform themselves when they have questions or before making major financial decisions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Thirdly, as body functions and organs continue to age, the vast majority of the elderly will experience a stage of disability, semi-disability or even dementia. The resulting need for medical care will have a negative impact on the lives of their children. constitute a great challenge. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The national elderly care strategy is &quot;9073&quot;, that is, 90% of the elderly are provided with home care, 7% are provided with community care, and 3% are provided with institutional care. A 2023 Beijing survey found that more than 99% of the elderly in Beijing choose home care, while less than 1% choose institutional care. Therefore, except for some completely disabled elderly people who are supported by the government, the vast majority of disabled elderly people still rely on their children to take care of them. Children generally have to contribute both money and effort, and the most important part is contribution. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Disabled elderly people can only eat three meals a day in bed or in a wheelchair. If they lose the function of their hands or have dementia, they need to be fed, just like parents feeding themselves when they are one or two years old, and they must also help with defecation. , wipe your body or take a bath regularly; use a wheelchair to push outdoors on sunny days, so that the disabled elderly can enjoy the sunshine and breeze, feel happy and refresh their spirits; lying in bed for a long time, you must turn over regularly, otherwise the blood circulation will not be smooth, which will lead to vascular embolism or bedsores. ; If dementia is superimposed, it will be even more troublesome. Some elderly people will have delusions, become violent, and even smear feces all over the house, making it difficult to clean up. The odor will also attract complaints from neighbors... Disability and dementia For the elderly, it is generally impossible to hire a nanny to take care of them. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At this time, as the mainstay of the family, you are in middle age, you have seniors and juniors, you have unlimited responsibilities on your shoulders, everyone relies on you and you have no one to rely on, this kind of pressure It&#39;s unprecedented. If you add a mid-life workplace crisis, it will be even more stressful. Therefore, as aging intensifies, this social problem will become more serious. But it is obviously difficult to solve this problem with a &quot;socialized&quot; system solution that transfers costs to society, unless robots are smart enough to replace human care. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Aging, two kinds of disability, and three major problems are all social problems that require serious consideration and treatment by the whole society. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 24 Oct 2023 22:25:05 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[探访“山地之王”：高仙芝的高原足迹]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259129]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-24 20:55:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/23/9f8Kpn5eNv9GuiP2GOXSS097RDqjQpFK5sNsyUlf.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/23/9f8Kpn5eNv9GuiP2GOXSS097RDqjQp FK5sNsyUlf. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254965&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Aerial view of the Pamir Mountains&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot; >;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In mid-August, I set off from Kashgar and cycled along the Karakoram Highway to Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. Since my country’s Khunjerab Port does not allow cycling to pass customs, I need to take a transit bus in Taxkorgan County, check the bicycle as luggage, and continue riding after arriving at Khunjerab National Park on the Pakistani side. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Khunjerab Pass is 4,783 meters above sea level. On one side of the border with my country is the wide-open and wide-open valley terrain of the eastern Pamir Plateau. The climate is arid and the vegetation is sparse. It is rare to see a tree at the foot of the mountain. Surrounded by a courtyard wall - it is a family of Tajik herders; entering Pakistan, it quickly transforms into a valley terrain with surging rapids - this is a canyon cut by the Hunza River in the southeastern part of the Pamir Plateau. It collided left and right in the mountain knot formed by the intersection of the Karakoram Mountains, Himalayas and Hindu Kush Mountains, and fell rapidly. From the border line of Khunjerab Pass to the entrance of Khunjerab National Park where Pakistan conducts border inspection, it is a short 40-kilometer journey, and the altitude drops by about one thousand meters; from the border inspection to Sost, the Pakistani port ), a distance of about 38 kilometers, and the altitude has dropped by nearly a thousand meters - which is naturally great news for cyclists. By the time I rode all the way downhill to the Ganish village in the eastern part of the Hunza Valley, the altitude had dropped to about 2,400 meters, which was only half of the Khunjerab Pass. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Not far south of Ganish, I saw a pedestrian rope bridge flying north and south over the raging Hunza River, and a warm current suddenly surged in my heart - more than 1,200 years ago , Gao Xianzhi, a famous general in the Tang Dynasty, used a similar rope bridge in the lower reaches of this river to block the way of the fierce enemy troops. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/23/xWctTRMmRc2MxiLpdWwLNYWZpCV4uwzyTRNSw53W.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;763&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/23/xWctTRMmRc2MxiLpdWwLNYWZpCV4uwzyTRNSw53W.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254966&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;A pedestrian rope bridge over the Hunza River&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Wang Zaitian/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong >;Kashmir&#39;s &quot;Great Game&quot;: Smoke and dust flying to the west of Jinshan Mountain&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Before Gao Xianzhi rushed to the rope bridge, the prospect of the expeditionary force he commanded was not good: facing a surrendering enemy The fortified city, as well as a large number of enemy reinforcements coming all the way, while our own army has been on the march for more than three months, traveled more than 1,500 kilometers, and faced the extremely harsh geological and climatic conditions in Congling (&lt;em>; After continuous fighting in the wind and snow, the lone expeditionary force advanced deeply into the enemy&#39;s territory. They did not understand the language, had no siege equipment, lacked logistical supplies, and could not get reinforcements. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Such a difficult situation may have been encountered by Alexander the Great during his legendary expedition to Asia and Europe. However, Alexander stationed his troops to the west of Congling and never crossed over. Gao Xianzhi&#39;s mission was precisely to cross the Congling to regain the lost territory. What&#39;s more, his military strength, animal power and material resources were far less than Alexander&#39;s expeditionary force. This may be why Gao Xianzhi later He was called the &quot;King of the Mountains&quot; by one of his rivals, Sahib jibal al-Sin. Sahib is the Turkic word for &quot;master&quot; , jibal is &quot;mountain&quot; in Arabic, and al-Sin is of China)&lt;/span>; reason. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Gao Xianzhi is a descendant of the Goguryeo royal family. His ancestors were the Fuyu people who emerged in the Hunjiang River Basin and the middle reaches of the Yalu River in Northeast China. &quot;Gao was their surname&quot; and established the Goguryeo regime during the Western Han Dynasty, which lasted seven hundred years. For a long time, it once occupied Liaodong to the southwest, and then crossed the Yalu River to the southeast and entered the Korean Peninsula. After the Goguryeo regime perished under the military attacks of the Sui and Tang dynasties, the Tang Dynasty moved the defeated Gao royal family to the Central Plains and Longyou. Gao Xianzhi followed his father Gao Sheji into the army and became a border guard in the Tang Dynasty. He grew up in the Hexi Corridor. He grew up in a military camp, and when he was a boy, he was transferred to the Anxi Protectorate with his father, which is today&#39;s southern Xinjiang, Pamir Plateau and Central Asia Hezhong region. He rose to prominence in his twenties and was promoted to general, the same level as his father. Later, he was further recognized by the leader of the Qiang people and the governor of Anxi, Meng Lingjin, and was promoted to deputy governor of Anxi and commander of the four towns. The horse envoy is equivalent to Fumeng Lingjin&#39;s deputy and the military chief of the entire southern Xinjiang. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the sixth year of Tianbao&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>; (747 AD)&lt;/span>;, Gao Xianzhi received an edict from Emperor Xuanzong of the Tang Dynasty, appointing him In order to serve as a military envoy, I made my fourth expedition to Congling after the failure of my three predecessors to recapture Xiaobolu - the Pakistani-controlled Kashmir where I rode to. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/23/fKtCWOawnzDSfDbU6a8InBuv60cCYamb90OjqJHx.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;579&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/23/fKtCWOawnzDSfDbU6a8InBuv60cCYamb90OjqJHx.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254967&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Cycling in Hunza, Pakistan&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Today&#39;s Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (Gilgit-Baltistan) is divided into two parts, Gilgit and Baltistan. The origin of the division can be traced back to the Greater and Lesser Bulu. The original name of this place was Boloristan, which means &quot;mountain country&quot;, where &quot;stan&quot; means &quot;country&quot; in Turkic language. Today, there are five &quot;stan&quot; countries in Central Asia, including Kazakhstan, and Pakistan in South Asia; Bolor means plateau and mountainous area - this place name is famous in the Western Regions of the Tang Dynasty and is translated as &quot;Bolu&quot;. It is the junction area of ​​the four kingdoms of Tang, Tubo, Tianzhu and Dashi, and is divided into the western and western regions. Xiao Bolu in the Sa Valley and Big Bolu in the upper reaches of the Indus River in the east - the goal of Gao Xianzhi&#39;s expedition was Xiao Bolu. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Big and Little Bolu were originally one country, and their territory included most of today&#39;s Pakistan-controlled Kashmir and the northern part of Indian-controlled Kashmir. It was a must-win place for Tubo in its Western Region strategy. At the beginning of the seventh century, Tubo annexed the ancient Shangshung Kingdom in the Ali region and unified the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. From then on, it began to implement its Western Region strategy based on the Ali region, and launched a nearly two-year-long war with the Tang Dynasty around Bolu, that is, the Kashmir region. The &quot;Great Game&quot; between Tang and Tibet for centuries. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/23/BPoP6sb1xhgMaISzFXsrbGNTYIjafKo87zl8Qs4z.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/23/BPoP6sb1xhgMaISzFXsrbGNTYIjafKo87zl8Qs4z.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254969&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Hunza Valley&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Wang Zaitian/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tubo is backed by the Himalayas. It borders the Tang Dynasty in three directions: north, east and south. Why do we have to choose Kashmir to decide the outcome? Tubo initially launched the main attack on Datang on the Hehuang and Jiannan fronts, but failed to open up the situation. After occupying the Ngari region, Tibet tried to seize southern Xinjiang via the northern Qiangtang Prairie and across the Altyn Mountains. After being blocked again, they had to turn to expand northwest along the Shiquan River/Indus River Basin, intending to bypass the Himalayas and enter through the Ladakh region. Kashmir eventually joined forces with the Western Turks in the north to deal with the Tang Dynasty. In short, Tubo was like a lion trapped on a high platform. It was attacked head-on by the Tang army in Qinghai, Sichuan, Yunnan and Xinjiang. It was unable to get down to the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. In the end, it had to choose to go down the mountain from Kashmir, where there was no Tang army, and take a detour. Congling attacked the western border of Tang Dynasty. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Belu Kingdom, located on this expansion route, became a &quot;soft persimmon&quot; that Tibet fought against with all its strength, and soon split into two countries: the Belu Homeland became a Tubo vassal state, known as &quot; The Great Burud&quot; was roughly located in today&#39;s Baltistan area; another royal family moved westward to the Hunza Valley and established the &quot;Little Burud&quot;, which was roughly located in today&#39;s Gilgit area, relying on the Hunza River and Gilgit The Te River&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(called Suyi River in ancient times)&lt;/span>; and the Indus River line up with deep valleys and natural chasms to resist the Tibetan invasion. King Xiao Bolu did not hesitate to send an envoy to ask for help from the Tang Dynasty, saying that Bolu was the gateway to the Western Regions of the Tang Dynasty. If it fell, all the countries in the Western Regions would fall to Tubo, and the Western Regions would no longer be controlled by the Tang Dynasty&lt;span style =&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(Bo Lu, Ximen of the Tang Dynasty. If he loses it, all the Western countries will fall to Tubo)&lt;/span>;, and was finally canonized by Emperor Xuanzong of the Tang Dynasty and became the Tang Dynasty Subject to the country. In the tenth year of Kaiyuan (722 AD), the Beiting Protectorate of the Tang Army sent 4,000 cavalry reinforcements to Xiaobolu to attack Xiaobolu. He repelled the attack of the Tibetan army and won nearly twenty years of peace for Xiaobolu. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 740 AD, Tubo instigated the Tuqishi Khanate in the northern grasslands to rebel against the Tang Dynasty through marriage, and contained the main force of the Tang army in the Western Regions in the northern Xinjiang. On this occasion, he proposed to Xiao Bolu to &quot;borrow a road&quot; and build a rope bridge on the Suyi River. The Tubo army, which successfully crossed the natural barrier of the Suyi River, immediately turned against the foreigners and occupied Xiaobolu. King Su Feng of Xiaobolu was forced to marry the Tibetan princess, and together with more than 20 surrounding small countries, they rebelled against Tang and surrendered to Tibet. The Tibetan army was able to occupy the entire Bolu and get a glimpse of Congling: they captured Lianyun Fort, the fortress of the Tang army guarding the Wakhan Valley, the main road to Congling, opening the way to the north to Central Asia to make friends with the Turks, and cutting off the capital of Anxi. The road from Hufu to the Zhaowu Kingdoms in the Hezhong region also formed a condescending military advantage over the four Anxi towns of the Tang Dynasty located in the Tarim Basin. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Under the unfavorable situation that a gap was opened in the defense line of the Western Region, the Anxi Protectorate had to concentrate all its efforts in order to regain Bolu and block the &quot;downhill&quot; channel of Tubo. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/23/bZT8JG7NjiRBsR7Doyj7Jnnki6xEICEQfr28g9Y1.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/23/bZT8JG7NjiRBsR7Doyj7Jnnki6xEICEQfr28g9Y1.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254970&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The barren and pure river valley in Hunza region&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt; strong>;Recovering the Wakhan Valley: The captives should be frightened after hearing this&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Nowadays, the most convenient way to go from China&#39;s Pamir Plateau to Pakistan-occupied Kashmir is to go south along the Hunza Valley, or That is to say, follow the Karakoram Highway, which was historically one of the important passages along the southern route of the Silk Road to South Asia. It’s just that in ancient times, caravans used to go through the Mingtie Gaidaban, and when China and Pakistan planned and built the Karakoram Highway in the 1960s, in order to avoid the military threat of the Soviet Union—Tajikistan, which today occupies most of the Pamir Plateau, was Afghanistan, a republic of the Soviet Union, was also under Soviet hostage at the time. The Soviet army deployed an army division in the Wakhan Valley and built missile launch sites and airports. It was eyeing my country&#39;s southern Xinjiang - so it chose the east of Mingtie Gaida Ban. , far away from the Sino-Soviet border and the Khunjerab Pass with complex mountains to achieve better strategic concealment. The cost is that the China-Pakistan Highway on the Pakistani side has a large gap and is easily damaged by natural disasters such as landslides and mudslides. For example, in 2010, a landslide formed a barrier lake, causing the China-Pakistan Highway to be interrupted for five years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When Gao Xianzhi went on an expedition to Xiaobolu, he neither took the Mingtiegaida Ban nor the Hongqilafu Pass, because this line of mountainous terrain was already controlled by the Tibetan army at that time. If he took these passes, it would be difficult. Faced with the huge risk of being attacked from the front and rear by the Tibetan army stationed in Lianyunbao, cutting off the food route. Therefore, what he chose was to first pull out Lianyunbao, the nail that was driven into the Congling Mountains, and then go south through the Yasin Valley parallel to it on the west side of the Hunza Valley, and attack Xiaobolu in a roundabout way. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lianyun Fort in the Tang Dynasty was located in Sarhad, the last village in eastern Afghanistan today. It guarded the east entrance of the Wakhan Valley, and continued eastward into the Sino-Afghan border area. desert areas. The Wakhan Valley, also known as the Penchi Valley or the Wakhan Corridor, is a valley between the Pamir Plateau and the Hindu Kush Mountains. It stretches more than 600 miles from east to west and is an important cultural passage in the history of China and India. An important part of the southern route of the Silk Road. Zhang Qian of the Han Dynasty &quot;emptied out the Western Region&quot; and went through Congling to the Hezhong area to search for the Dayue clan; nearly 120 years before Gao Xianzhi&#39;s expedition to Xiaobolu&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312 , STKaiti;&quot;>;(629 AD)&lt;/span>;, &quot;Tang Monk&quot; Xuanzang crossed the Wakhan Valley into South Asia after seven days and nights; the two great empires of Britain and Russia in modern times launched the &quot;Great Game&quot; in Central Asia, and finally used this As the dividing line and isolation zone between the north and the south, the valley demarcated the respective spheres of influence of the two countries, thus introducing the name &quot;Wakhan Corridor&quot;, and generously arbitrarily assigned this then Chinese territory to Afghanistan. It became an abrupt appendix at the eastern end of Afghanistan&#39;s territory. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tibet defended the Lianyunbao Fortress at the east entrance of the Wakhan Valley, &quot;weaving wood into a city based on mountains and rivers, cuttings and cliffs in the valley&quot;. To the east, you can enter southern Xinjiang along the Taxkorgan Valley, and to the north you can cross The Pamir Plateau enters Central Asia. To the west, you can bypass the Hindu Kush Mountains and enter South Asia, or you can go to the Transoxiana region along the Pench River. To the south, you can rely on the Hindu Kush Mountains to protect the newly occupied Big and Little Burrows. It can be said that it is connected in all directions. , strategic location. In order to fight steadily, Gao Xianzhi must first clear out the Tubo advance position, and then go south to regain Xiaobolu. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I was unable to go to the Wakhan Valley to visit Lianyunbao in person, so I had to first take the China-Pakistan Highway to reach the small Buludu city of Gilgit - today&#39;s capital of Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (Gilgit), and then walk along the Gao Xianzhi&#39;s march route went in the opposite direction, first going westward along the Gilgit River, then northward along its tributary Yasin Valley, and reaching the southern slope of the Hindu Kush Mountains. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/23/ItRbcoHPJdl4kV2Y35bCnG8BbEqBsEmisEeqIQWS.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;641&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/23/ItRbcoHPJdl4kV2Y35bCnG8BbEqBsEmisEeqIQWS.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254968&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Tashkorgan Stone City&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Based on the old and new Tang books According to records, Gao Xianzhi commanded 10,000 infantry - equivalent to half of the mobile troops of the Anxi Protectorate - from Qiuci in the fourth lunar month of 747 AD >; (Today&#39;s Kuqa)&lt;/span>; Set out and spent more than a month along the southern foot of Tianshan Mountains via Diazhuangcheng &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(today&#39;s Aksu)&lt;/ span>;, hold Sede&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(today&#39;s Bachu)&lt;/span>; and go west to Shule&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 凯体, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(Today&#39;s Kashgar)&lt;/span>;, and mobilized some border guard cavalry along the way, and then followed the Taxkorgan River Valley southward to Congling to guard the capture&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312 , STKaiti;&quot;>;(&quot;Shouchu&quot; is a small military town in the Tang Dynasty)&lt;/span>;, which is the stone city outside Taxkorgan County today - &quot;Tash&quot; means &quot;stone&quot; in Turkic language. In the first ten days of the seventh lunar month, the Tang army, together with about 20,000 vassal troops from the Western Regions, crossed the Congling Mountains and arrived at Telemanchuan&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 毷体, 毷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>; (now Khorog, Tajikistan )&lt;/span>;. Gao Xianzhi divided his troops into three groups here. He led the main force of the Tang army back to the west side of Lianyun Fort. He also sent two groups of troops from Kashgar and Aksu to surround Lianyunguo from the north and east respectively. It was agreed on the 13th day of the seventh lunar month. A surprise attack was launched at the same time at day and night. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Historical records show that the Tubo army held on to the mountain and rolled logs and stones to &quot;cover the sky&quot;, making it difficult for the Tang army to succeed. Gao Xianzhi issued a strict order to his brave generals Li Siye and Tian Zhen: &quot;If we don&#39;t reach the sun, we must break the enemy!&quot;. The &quot;Old Book of Tang&quot; once wrote a biography of Li Siye, saying that he was born in the military and was &quot;seven feet long and extremely brave.&quot; Facing the intensive defense of the defenders, he and Tian Zhen held the double-edged Mo Dao and led a troop of Mo Dao soldiers. The commando team found another way and &quot;climbed first at the most dangerous place&quot;, that is, climbed up from the cliff that the Tubo defenders did not expect, and rushed into the enemy&#39;s stronghold from a high position. As expected, they captured the building before noon, which was garrisoned by more than 10,000 Tubo troops. , a fortress with a compound defense system composed of mountain fortresses and mountain foot camps, beheaded 5,000 people, captured more than 1,000 people, and won the largest tough battle of the expedition. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Tang army recaptured Lianyun Fort, drove the Tubo out of Congling, and regained the Wakhan Valley, the passage connecting the Western Regions. The next step was to cross the Hindu Kush Mountains, recapture Xiaobolu, and clear out the The threat of the Tibetan army to the Wakhan Valley. It was mid-August at that time. Today&#39;s Wakhan Corridor is only passable from June to August of the year. The mountains are blocked by heavy snow at other times. The climate in the Tang Dynasty was also the same. Presumably considering the weather factors, Gao Xianzhi did not delay at Lianyun Fort, leaving more than 3,000 weak soldiers behind. He led his elite infantry to march lightly and quickly, and ran for three days and nights, arriving at Darkut Pass (Darkut Pass, &lt;span style =&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Today&#39;s translation is Dakot Pass). &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/23/8kscrApbrsiJFCskX9KcLqRJ1jVIPF19O4ElMSvA.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 960&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/23/8kscrApbrsiJFCskX9KcLqRJ1jVIPF19O4ElMSvA.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254971&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Wakhan Corridor, with the Hindu Kush Mountains in the background. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Crossing the Hindu Kush: The vast sea is covered with hundreds of feet of ice&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Pakistan and Afghanistan are bounded by the Hindu Kush Mountains in the Wakhan Corridor. This Persian name was first seen in the narrative of the medieval Arab traveler Ibn Battuta. It is literally translated as &quot;Hindu (Hindu Kush)&quot;. &quot;Hindu&quot; killer (Kush)&quot;, which means that a large number of Indian slaves captured from the hot areas of South Asia froze to death while crossing this high and cold mountain; some people also interpret it as the &quot;Mountain of India&quot;, which means crossing southward This mountain range enters the Indian subcontinent. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Tanjuling Pass is located in the eastern section of the Hindu Kush Mountains, but it is not a pass that runs through this mountain range - because there are two watersheds and two mountain passes here. The eastern end of the Hindu Kush Mountains originates from the Pamir Plateau and has the characteristics of mountain twists and turns. It is divided into parallel north and south branches near the Tanju Ridge: the north branch is the border line between Pakistan and Afghanistan, and south of the south branch is the north and south branches. The Yasin River Valley runs east-west, while the Yarkhun River runs east-west between the north and south branches. Tanjuling Pass is a pass on the South Branch, with an altitude of 4688 meters. There are glaciers on both sides of the pass, making it difficult to cross. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So is there any other way? In fact, there is. After crossing the northern branch of the Hindu Kush Mountains, you can go west along the Yakun Valley, bypass the southern branch, and then cross the famous Shandur Pass (Shandur) eastward into the Gilgit Valley, and then you can go down the river to Xiaobo. law. However, this route is still extremely rugged and difficult to travel today in the 21st century. There are no paved roads in the Yaquin Valley. Most of the road sections are simple gravel roads located on steep cliffs and halfway up the mountain, and can only accommodate one vehicle passing through at low speeds. I was going to get a flat tire every minute, so I had to store my bike and hire a motorcyclist to take me into the Yaquin Valley. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/23/An6dIyETx5jIvnAWAGpM9XcSmAmAeJBj4xm0BGXR.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/23/An6dIyETx5jIvnAWAGpM9XcSmAmAeJBj4xm0BGXR.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254972&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Shandur Pass is the birthplace of polo. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Wang Zaitian/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is conceivable that the road conditions here 1,300 years ago would have been much worse than now. If Gao Xianzhi led his troops to go around the Yakun Valley, it would probably take an extra month to go. It would be mid-to-late September. The Tibetan reinforcements were already waiting in Xiaobolu Yiyi, and the Hindu Kush Mountains and the Pamir Plateau would soon be It will be impassable due to the severe cold, which means that the Tang army&#39;s return route will be cut off - I guess this is why Gao Xianzhi decided to race against time and led his army to risk crossing the Tanjuling Pass &quot;straight down for more than forty miles.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the soldiers who serve as soldiers and eat food do not have such strategic insight. After finally climbing up the ice and snow to Tanju Ridge, they looked at the rolling glaciers at their feet and asked Gao Xianzhi in panic: &quot;Where does the ambassador want me to go?&quot; - &quot;Ambassador&quot; is the honorific title given to Jiedushi in the Tang Dynasty - —Do you want us to slide down from the top of such a steep glacier? Are you taking us to Little Bolu or Yama Hall? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Thousands of years ago, Stein, a British-Hungarian explorer, wrote after an on-site inspection of Gao Xianzhi’s march route: &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;When I stood From the shimmering snow at the top of the mountain pass, peering down to the steep slopes that lead to the end of the Yasin Valley at 6,000 feet, we can understand why the Tang army refused to move forward at first, how difficult it was for them to struggle forward later, and how brave Gao Xianzhi was. clear! &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/23/QmEoteO6T3NeHWtoJELvU9xOW5FmFYpLIBb5Wihg.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1200&quot; height=&quot;668&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/23/QmEoteO6T3NeHWtoJELvU9xOW5FmFYpLIBb5Wihg.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254973&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Tanjuling&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Wang Zaitian/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, Gao Xianzhi Soldiers cannot be driven by personal bravery. He anticipated the weakness of human nature and knew that soldiers did not dare to climb the ice and go deep into the enemy&#39;s territory, so he quietly sent more than 20 of his trusted aides, dressed in Berrut clothing, to climb up Tanju Ridge in advance to wait for the large army. While the soldiers of the Tang Dynasty were wondering on the top of the mountain, these impostors came forward with smiles, claiming to be the defenders of Xiaobolu stationed opposite the mountain pass. They came to surrender to the king on behalf of the defenders of Anuyue City. Bo Lu has cut off the only way for Tibetan reinforcements to pass. This great (&lt;em>;false&lt;/em>;) news made the soldiers of the Tang Dynasty suddenly feel that victory was in sight, so they obeyed the general&#39;s order with confidence and crossed Tanju Ridge and entered the Yasin Valley. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to historians’ research, Anuyue City is located in today’s Gupis Town, where the Yasin River merges into the Gilgit River. The biggest pass on the way to the capital. I cycled along the paved road from Gilgit to Chitral. When a primary school on the roadside was getting out of school, three to five hundred girls wearing black hijabs happily poured out of the school gate&lt;span style=&quot; font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(local boys and girls each attend half-day school)&lt;/span>;, which temporarily blocked the road. After they dispersed into the streets, I saw the chain bridge built with Chinese aid on the north side of the highway across the fast-flowing Gilgit River. After crossing the bridge and going up the river a short distance away, I could see a clear tributary flowing from the northwest. Entering the big river, it is the Yasin River, which is formed by melting snow from Tanjuling Glacier. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/23/a3WXffZ5FQu5EWQchTj2pAmrlpm6JAxX4OpDzaI8.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/23/a3WXffZ5FQu5EWQchTj2pAmrlpm6JAxX4OpDzaI8.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254974&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The Yasin Valley under Tanju Ridge&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Wang Zaitian/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Conga The total distance from Nuyue City to the southern foot of Tanju Ridge at the source of the Yasin River is nearly 70 kilometers. It is also an unpaved simple dirt road. It took me three hours to arrive by car. Gao Xianzhi led his army over the mountains and ridges. Four days. When there was only one day left on the mountain road, good news came: Anuyue City had really sent an envoy to greet the Tang army. Perhaps the guard knew that the main force of the Tibetan army had been gathered and annihilated in Lianyun Fort, and the Tang army had crossed the dangerous Tanju Ridge. The Suyi River could no longer stop its troops, so they decided to surrender to the Tang Army in Kaicheng. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But what came to my mind was another scene: the Tang army soldiers looked at the two groups of Hu people in surprise. They both claimed to be the defenders of Anuyue City, and both claimed to be surrendering, but each other I don’t know each other, and I can’t communicate with them. The latter group had a Persian look, with their high noses and deep eyes, but the former group looked similar to me. They spoke in a nonsensical way and looked at each other awkwardly...&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Cut the Indus Valley: Ximen, the charioteer, stands to show off his victory&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Starting from Anuyue City, go east along the Suyi River to Niduo, the capital city of Xiaobolu, the distance is about One hundred and ten kilometers. Niduo City is located at the intersection of the Hunza Valley and the Sui River Valley. The original site of the city is unknown, but according to historical records, it should be located on the west bank of the Sui River. Today it is Gilgit, the capital of Pakistan-occupied Kashmir and is named after the river. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;About sixty miles further down the Sui River from Niduo City is the mouth of the Sui River where it merges into the Indus River. From there, going down the Indus River is what was known in ancient times as the &quot;Land of Five Rivers&quot;. &quot;Punjab Plain&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 毷体, 毷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(&quot;Punjab&quot; means &quot;Five Rivers&quot; in Hindi)&lt;/span>; - the five rivers originate from the Himalayas The tributaries at the southern foot of the mountain range merge into the Indus River one after another, forming a fertile alluvial plain that gave birth to ancient Indian civilization. From here, you can go upstream and pass through the spectacular grand canyon from the river mouth to Skardu. You can enter Dabolu and finally cross the Himalayas to reach the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Karakoram Highway goes south along the platform on the right side of the Hunza River, Gilgit River and Indus River, taking a beautiful U-shaped bend near the mouth of the Gilgit River and descending to the shore. Then cross the Gilgit River through a road bridge, and on the other side is Highway S1, which leads along the Indus River to the India-Pakistan confrontation area in Kashmir. Its strategic value is very important. During Gao Xianzhi&#39;s expedition, a rope bridge made of rattan was built where the highway bridge is now. It was built by Tibet by tricking Xiao Bolu into &quot;borrowing the road&quot;. It is &quot;one arrow wide&quot;, which means that the span of the vine bridge reaches the archery range of the time - about two hundred meters. This vine bridge is the only way for the Tibetan army to pass from Dabolu to Xiaobolu and even north to Congling. It can be said to be the key to the throat. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But it was said that Gao Xianzhi led his army to Niduo City, and the Xiaobolu nobles who were loyal to Tibet held on to the capital and refused to let the Tang army enter the city. Gao Xianzhi fell into the dilemma described at the beginning of this article: if Niduo City is not captured as soon as possible, once the Tibetan reinforcements arrive, the Tang army, which has lost its retreat, will inevitably fall into a pincer attack from both sides and be surrounded and annihilated under Niduo City in the coming severe winter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, Gao Xianzhi did not assume the posture of attacking the city - of course, he did not have the manpower and material resources to storm the fortified city. The top commander of the expeditionary force first sent an envoy to stabilize King Xiaobolu, claiming that the Tang army neither planned to attack the city nor destroy the Tengqiao, but intended to pass through the Tengqiao to attack the Tibetan army of Dabolu; secondly, he used The gold and silver property lured the pro-Tibet nobles who guarded the city, and tricked them into the Tang camp and beheaded them all; and the most important task, Gao Xianzhi handed over to the pioneer Xi Yuanqing: rush to the mouth of the Suyi River to destroy the Tengqiao. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The road from Niduo City to the mouth of the Suyi River was a military road laid by the Tibetan army. The road condition must be good, but by the time Xi Yuanqing marched sixty miles to Tengqiao, the sun had already set on the snow peak on the west side of the canyon. behind. In the deep dusk, he saw a flock of birds flying in the mountains opposite, and smoke and dust rising up - that was another army coming at full speed. Xi Yuanqing didn&#39;t waste any time and immediately ordered his soldiers to cut off the cane together. As soon as Tengqiao fell into the extremely fast Suyi River, which the ancients called weak water, a large group of Tibetan reinforcements rushed to the other side. Unfortunately, it was too late to cross the river. GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(&quot;Old Book of Tang&quot;: It was late in the evening, and it was just cut. The Tubo soldiers and horses arrived, and it was no longer possible). &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/23/PnJOz5W8HdgAwZ8xG3Di00h5CaRC2mXr2W1STqHx.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 960&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/23/PnJOz5W8HdgAwZ8xG3Di00h5CaRC2mXr2W1STqHx.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254976&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The fast-flowing Suyi River is also called weak water. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Wang Zaitian/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This vine bridge took a year to build.

The defeat of Xiaobolu King Su suddenly became the party that was besieged on all sides and had to surrender to Gao Xianzhi. The king and his Tibetan queen were sent to Chang&#39;an as prisoners, while Xiao Bolu was renamed the Quy Nhon Army and guarded here by a thousand Tang troops. The entire battle to recapture Xiaobolu lasted four months, but the actual combat process lasted only more than ten days. Except for the half-day bloody battle at Lianyun Castle, it could be said that the victory was achieved without any bloodshed in Xiaobolu. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Stein once commented: &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;A large number of armies passed through the Pamirs and Hindu Kush.

Only two years later, the Anshi Rebellion broke out, and the Central Plains fell into raging war. The Tang Dynasty, which was on the verge of extinction, was no longer able to manage the Western Regions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At this time, Tubo also changed its strategy against the Tang Dynasty. When faced with the strong troops of the Tang Dynasty, it detoured to Bolu to attack one of its four towns in Anxi. Instead, it used the Tang Dynasty to repeatedly mobilize Hexi elites to quell rebellions in the interior, which led to local rebellions. With the opportunity of empty troops, they resumed their main attack on the Hehuang area, seizing the Hexi Corridor connecting the Western Regions of the Tang Dynasty and the Central Plains, and then defeated the towns and countries in the Western Regions that had lost contact and were isolated. The ruling system of the Western Regions of the Tang Dynasty collapsed. By the beginning of the ninth century, the Anxi Protectorate had completely fallen, and the north and south of the Tianshan Mountains were not re-incorporated into the territory of my country until the Qianlong period of the Qing Dynasty. Therefore, it was called &quot;Xinjiang&quot;, which means &quot;new return to the homeland&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for why Gao Xianzhi was transferred out of the Western Regions at the height of his military power, that is another story of ups and downs. &lt;p>; The two moved to the Western Regions and traveled all over the north and south of the Tianshan Mountains.)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https: //feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color :orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 24 Oct 2023 21:25:05 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[制造数字人]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259222]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-24 20:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 24 Oct 2023 20:55:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[李尚福被免去国务委员、国防部部长职务，秦刚被免去国务委员职务]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259226]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-24 19:19:58&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;video id=&quot;contents-video-0&quot; data-fileid=&quot;3270835011391102109&quot; data-media=&quot; video&quot; data-resource=&quot;tencent&quot; data-filename=&quot;Xi Jinping signed Presidential Order No. 12, No. 13, and No. 14.mp4&quot; data-cover=&quot;http://1251434507.vod2.myqcloud. com/48276b87vodtransgzp1251434507/35d229ad3270835011391102109/sampleSnapshot/sampleSnapshot_10_0.jpg&quot; data-url=&quot;http://1251434507.vod2.myqcloud.com/93ffc8dfvodgzp12514 34507/35d229ad3270835011391102109/DQLOOyhweoEA.mp4&quot; poster=&quot;&quot; controls=&quot;controls&quot; width=&quot;640 &quot; height=&quot;360&quot;>; &lt;source src=&quot;http://1251434507.vod2.myqcloud.com/93ffc8dfvodgzp1251434507/35d229ad3270835011391102109/DQLOOyhweoEA.mp4&quot; type=&quot;video/mp4&quot;>;&lt;/video>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p >;According to CCTV&#39;s &quot;News Network&quot;, Chairman&#39;s Order No. 14 said that according to the decision of the Sixth Meeting of the Standing Committee of the 14th National People&#39;s Congress of the People&#39;s Republic of China on October 24, 2023:&lt;/p>; &lt; p>;1.

More than 40 million elderly people in my country fall at least once every year, and bathrooms are the hardest hit area for elderly people to fall. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to solve the problem of &quot;unsuitable for aging&quot; in some rural housing, Lishui City, Zhejiang Province has carried out aging-friendly renovations on more than 2,300 rural elderly households since 2021, allowing the elderly to have night lights to wake up at night and assistive devices to walk. , There are seats in the bath. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;——Care services come into the home, allowing the elderly to have a peaceful life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Peng Hanquan, a subsistence allowance recipient who lives in Guangfu Village, Qingshanpu Town, Changsha County, Hunan Province, has limited mobility in both lower limbs and can only rely on his wife to take care of him. The local government purchased home care services for him. Based on the needs of the elderly, caregivers at the local care center provide home care services more than 8 times a month, including haircuts, meal assistance, rehabilitation guidance, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Jiashan County, Zhejiang Province, the local government has explored and piloted a long-term care insurance system to accurately identify the needs of the elderly with disabilities and dementia, and has provided a total of more than 9,500 elderly people with life care, rehabilitation care and other services. Ensure the life of disabled and dementia elderly people in their later years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The reporter found in interviews that rural elderly care services in some areas also face many practical difficulties. Some grassroots civil affairs cadres reported that due to the low population density in rural areas, the cost of providing meal assistance, medical assistance and other services is high. The supply of health care services in rural areas is insufficient, and some severely disabled and demented elderly people are prone to difficulty in providing care and poor quality of life. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The community elderly care service model continues to innovate&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Opinions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council on Strengthening Aging Work in the New Era&quot; issued in 2021 proposed &quot;innovating the home community elderly care service model&quot;; in May this year , the &quot;Opinions on Promoting the Construction of Basic Elderly Care Service Systems&quot; issued by the General Office of the CPC Central Committee and the General Office of the State stated that &quot;property service companies should be supported in providing home-based and community-based elderly care services according to local conditions&quot; and &quot;supported by elderly care institutions in operating community elderly care service facilities.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The reporter’s interview found that some cities rely on communities to develop diversified home-based elderly care services, allowing community services and home-based elderly care to be nested and integrated with each other. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Gongshu District, Hangzhou City, there are 8 built-in elderly care institutions and more than 580 home elderly care beds, which can effectively meet the personalized needs of the elderly in the community. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/23/e443db73131a798f830e2b794e0c77db.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;809&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/23/e443db73131a798f830e2b794e0c77db.png&quot; data-key=&quot;255019&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Medical staff help the elderly with rehabilitation training in Desheng Community Nursing Home, Daguan Street, Gongshu District, Hangzhou City.

Every morning around 8 a.m., the staff picks her up from the institution and takes her home in the afternoon after her children get off work. The day-care fee is 80 yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Changsha, Hunan, the “elderly care + housekeeping” service model has achieved initial results. The reporter saw at the Comprehensive Elderly Care Service Center in Mapoling Street, Furong District, Changsha City that caregivers can not only provide basic services such as nutritious meal preparation, cleaning assistance, and bathing assistance, but also provide professional nursing services, such as health monitoring, rehabilitation exercises, Assisted medication, etc.; it can provide long-term residential services, or provide door-to-door services by &quot;ordering&quot; the elderly or their children. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Beijing, personalized services provided by “elderly care butlers” have become popular in some communities. The Beijing Civil Affairs Bureau divided the pilot streets into several areas. Each area established a &quot;2+N+X&quot; management unit, equipped with 2 high-quality chief elderly care service stewards, N professional elderly care service personnel and several volunteers. , responsible for the elderly care services in 2 to 3 communities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The reporter’s interview found that some urban community elderly care services still have some shortcomings and insufficient service guarantee capabilities. Many old communities have few public spaces, making it difficult to build senior care canteens, care centers, etc.; most community senior care stations operate in a &quot;small workshop&quot; business model, lacking industry-influential business entities; there is still a shortage of senior care nursing talents, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Multiple parties share the responsibility to allow the elderly to spend their old age peacefully &quot;at home&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Opinions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council on Strengthening the Work on Aging in the New Era&quot; proposed that &quot;building coordinated home-based community institutions , an elderly care service system and a health support system that combine medical care and health care” and “promote the gathering of various high-quality service resources to the elderly’s side, home and surroundings.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/23/acbb9f4950eac6f42eaf4ffa3216b614.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;809&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/23/acbb9f4950eac6f42eaf4ffa3216b614.png&quot; data-key=&quot;255021&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Elderly people are having lunch at the Comprehensive Elderly Care Service Center in Xijiao Street, Kongtong District, Pingliang City, Gansu Province. Photo by Xinhua News Agency reporter Wang Zixuan&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Where there are many elderly people, we will set up elderly care service institutions.” The Ministry of Civil Affairs and other departments stated that during the “14th Five-Year Plan” period, they will promote the development of old urban areas and completed residential areas. The (community) district has basically completed the community elderly care service facilities, and promoted the construction of a &quot;15-minute&quot; home elderly care service circle in urban communities, making home community elderly care services richer, more convenient, and of higher quality. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xu Jiazeng, president of the Zhejiang Elderly Service Industry Association, believes that the focus of rural elderly care services should be on the provision of social services for people with disabilities and dementia. It is necessary to strengthen assistance and assistance to low-income groups, accelerate the establishment of a long-term care insurance system, give full play to the network advantages of township health centers and rural doctors, and encourage rural doctors to provide regular physical examinations, home visits, home hospital beds, etc. for the elderly, seriously ill, disabled and other elderly groups. Basic services. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Guo Hanqiao, deputy director of the Beijing Municipal Civil Affairs Bureau, suggested encouraging social capital to enter the elderly care industry, cultivating diversified business entities, and jointly making the elderly care service industry bigger and stronger. At present, Beijing has explored the establishment of a unified information platform for elderly care services to smooth resource docking, supply and demand matching, and support and guide business entities to actively participate in elderly care services. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In response to problems such as the shortage of elderly care talents, Ding Fujun, director of the Civil Affairs Bureau of Shangyu District, Shaoxing City, Zhejiang Province, suggested improving the treatment of nursing staff and increasing the public’s recognition of nursing staff. At the same time, we will guide the majority of social welfare organizations, charities, and young volunteers to participate in elderly care services. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, we must vigorously promote the application and digital management of smart devices to empower elderly care services. At present, some places are already exploring this aspect. For example, Hangzhou City has carried out a housing protection project, and installed intelligent monitoring equipment such as smoke alarms and emergency callers on demand for aging-appropriate renovation objects; Changsha City has carried out targeted aging-appropriate renovation projects. Some elderly people are equipped with &quot;anti-lost&quot; technology clothing, sleep monitors and other smart devices, and their health data are synchronized to the cloud in real time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 24 Oct 2023 19:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[1840年以来的中国与美国（中）丨倬彼云汉]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259193]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-24 18:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/24/t0J4qtLpFTF6UmbRCvw4UEB36ori63tp3iVUJbVg.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;962&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/t0J4qtLpFTF6UmbRCvw4UEB36ori63tp 3iVUJbVg. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255064&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;The international landscape under the &quot;containment policy&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In 1949, the Kuomintang retreated to Taiwan. During this period, the United States conducted an in-depth review and determined its national policy: How to prevent and block the joint front between the Soviet Union and China? How should the so-called &quot;free world&quot;, that is, Europe and the United States led by Britain and the United States, face the socialist lineup? Will countries advocating a capitalist free economy and countries pursuing a socialist planned economy coexist peacefully, or will they be in constant confrontation? This was something the U.S. government was very concerned about at the time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1947, President Truman adopted a containment policy after consulting Marshall, Eisenhower and MacArthur on the above issues. On February 22, 1946, George F. Kennan, Charge d&#39;Affaires of the U.S. Embassy in Moscow, sent the famous &quot;Long Telegram&quot; to the State Department. Kennan&#39;s suggestion established the United States&#39; plan for the postwar world: the &quot;Strategy of Containment.&quot; From the Truman era to the Nixon era, various diplomatic measures were taken in this direction. During the Nixon era, Kissinger planned the &quot;Engagement&quot; policy. However, from the overall principle, &quot;connection&quot; is only a means, trying to break out a gap in the &quot;containment&quot;. Therefore, the &quot;containment policy&quot; can be said to be the highest principle for the United States to deal with world affairs for decades. Until recently, this policy evolved into a frantic situation that was not anticipated at the time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Looking back from 1947 to the present, for more than seventy years, most of the Western world has been ruled by this &quot;containment policy&quot;: the United States hopes that it should take on the role of &quot;free world&quot; and &quot;free economy&quot; defender&quot; responsibility. All possible &quot;gaps&quot; must be plugged as much as possible - extending from the North Sea to the Sea of ​​Okhotsk, and from Berlin to Sakhalin. This long front was dominated by the Soviet Union, and China, as an unspecified &quot;partner&quot; - which side China&#39;s &quot;partner&quot; status was on, was not stated in this cable. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for the implementation of this policy, the United States decided to use the three important figures mentioned above as the main executors. The first step was for Marshall, as Secretary of State, to preside over the &quot;Marshall Plan&quot; (officially known as the &quot;European Recovery Program&quot;) aimed at promoting European recovery, and at the same time use US dollars to assist Greece and Turkey - these two countries are The Soviet fleet entered the Mediterranean Sea from the Caspian Sea and the Black Sea. In the East, after Japan surrendered, MacArthur wanted to build Japan and South Korea into &quot;the democratic fortresses of the East&quot; and personally preside over the defense of the Eastern Front. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After Truman retired, Eisenhower took over, and the three maintained this situation for decades. One of the episodes was that Truman could not stand that MacArthur &quot;would not be ordered by the king&quot; and recalled this warrior from South Korea. However, Marshall and Eisenhower faithfully implemented this policy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The first step of this policy in the East was that the U.S. Seventh Fleet began patrolling the Taiwan Strait, allowing Kinmen and Matsu, the two remaining bases of the Kuomintang Taiwan authorities, to be isolated on the coast of mainland China. preservation. Qingdao was originally a naval base for the US military stationed in China, but the Americans withdrew before they were actually involved in the battlefield on China&#39;s mainland. Otherwise, the US military stationed in Qingdao will echo the US military stationed in South Korea. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This decision triggered a series of changes in East Asia. The United States strengthens its bases in the Philippines and uses Japan and Ryukyu as important strongholds in the United States&#39; eastern defense line. Together with Taiwan, it forms the &quot;first island chain&quot; to contain mainland China. This policy has been maintained for a long time, implemented vigorously, and has far-reaching influence until today. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since then, the United States has refused to communicate with mainland China. Even though the &quot;Republic of China&quot; was forced to withdraw from the United Nations in 1971, the United States still maintained relations with it until 1978, when Beijing and Washington formally established diplomatic relations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the Cold War began, defending Taiwan became one of the tasks of the United States. As far as the Taiwan authorities are concerned, without the &quot;reassurance&quot; of the United States - the United States has drawn its defense line in the Taiwan Strait - the construction of this base in Taiwan would not have been possible. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The grievances and grievances between Taiwan and the mainland on the other side of the Taiwan Strait cannot be resolved to this day. How will these disputes be resolved in the future? How can we &quot;reunify&quot;? How can the results of Taiwan&#39;s construction, Taiwan&#39;s talents, Taiwan&#39;s economic foundation, and the mainland&#39;s economic construction support each other? This depends on the wisdom of us Chinese people, thinking about how to take into account the Chinese blood. Of course, the DPP and I have different ideas regarding the words &quot;Chinese blood.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, the two sides of the Taiwan Strait have supported each other in economic construction, and this has not stopped since the 1970s. Mainland China&#39;s economic construction is about twenty years later than Taiwan&#39;s, because it experienced thirty years of bumps caused by trying various policies. From the time when Deng Xiaoping came to power to today, the cooperation and communication between the two sides has been carried out by the Straits Affairs Committee of both sides as the &quot;bridge&quot;, and by foreign heads of state such as Lee Kuan Yew as the &quot;middleman&quot;. Before Hong Kong and Macao returned to China, they were natural points of contact between the two sides. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The second very important thing is the institutional reform of Taiwan initiated by Chiang Ching-kuo. He declared: &quot;We, the Chiang family, will no longer be involved in politics.&quot; Later, Lee Teng-hui changed Taiwan&#39;s basic law. But paradoxically, the U.S. government continues to promise to &quot;defend Taiwan with all its strength.&quot; This statement has become a rare example in the history of international relations. People familiar with international affairs once described this arrangement as &quot;intentional ambiguity.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Chinese history, from the Spring and Autumn Period to the Warring States Period, the Jin State was the de facto leader of the &quot;Five Hegemons&quot;. Jin took possession of the cognac of its ally Weiguo. The hegemony of the Jin State was already declining at that time, and its interior was eventually divided among the three families of Korea, Zhao, and Wei. Chinese history entered the &quot;Seven Heroes&quot; era of the Warring States Period. At that time, those who really had the strength to compete for hegemony were the two marginal powers, Qin and Chu. The two hegemons Wu and Yue that appeared in the gap were just short-lived. The two marginal powers, Qin and Chu, competed. In the end, Qin unified China and became the predecessor of the &quot;Chinese Empire&quot;. The process of Qin&#39;s unification of the Central Plains and the system it established actually restricted the form of the Chinese Empire for two thousand years, and it was only changed in 1911. Here, I use this example from Chinese history to foresee possible future changes in the hegemony of the United States over the past few decades. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since the establishment of U.S. hegemony, East Asia has encountered many crises: a Korean War and two Vietnam Wars - Japan and South Korea have become de facto &quot;dependencies&quot; of the United States, and Okinawa&#39;s status has become unclear. white. And these are all the consequences of the &quot;containment policy.&quot; The United States was so hegemonic that it could do the same thing in other countries that the Jin State obtained the cognac of the Wei State - Cognac was a stronghold in the eastern half of the Central Plains at that time, and the Jin State could not command the northern half. This situation is very similar to the &quot;island chain&quot; situation in East Asia. Paradoxically, the Zhao State, which was separated from the Jin State, finally took away the Cognac. We cannot predict whether the United States will transform Taiwan into an &quot;extension&quot; of Japan and South Korea in the future. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Look at the situation in Europe. After the &quot;Marshall Plan&quot;, the United States established NATO and the European Union, focusing on the three countries of Britain, France, and Germany—the past enemy Germany—to guard the heart of Europe. Decades later, the European Union now feels that the United States was there to protect them, but now the United States has become their master. The United States spent a lot of effort to defend Europe. The &quot;Marshall Plan&quot; really rebuilt a world full of flowers and flowers from the ruins. Today&#39;s Germany has a prosperous economic foundation that is different from the United States we see today - Britain and France were defeated, and Germany came up. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the war, the United States divided Germany into two: half occupied by the West and half occupied by the Soviet Union - just like North Korea was divided into South Korea, South Vietnam and North Vietnam. Berlin is an independent city, and a &quot;Berlin Wall&quot; was built in the middle. During the first Berlin Crisis in 1948, the Soviet Union blocked Berlin. The United States airdropped food, hamburgers, hot dogs, milk, eggs and even paper and other daily necessities for several months. The planes never stopped on the runway. That&#39;s a staggering expense. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On June 25, 1963, Kennedy gave a speech in Berlin - &quot;As a free man, I am extremely proud to say: I am a Berliner.&quot; After becoming president, Kennedy also said: We Don&#39;t forget that Churchill and our old President Roosevelt once proposed that human beings should have &quot;four freedoms.&quot; (The &quot;Atlantic Charter&quot; signed by Roosevelt and Churchill actually has two &quot;versions&quot;: one is a long &quot;treaty&quot;, and the other is a short slogan of the &quot;Four Freedoms&quot; - freedom from fear, freedom from want , freedom of speech, freedom of belief.) It is our unshirkable duty to be the guardians of the world and safeguard these &quot;four freedoms.&quot; Back then, Kennedy swore an oath based on the &quot;Four Freedoms&quot;: Our mission is long and arduous. Don’t ask what the country can do for us, ask what we can do for the country. After President Roosevelt implemented the New Deal, the country fulfilled its responsibilities to its citizens and maintained their minimum standard of living. The responsibility of our government is to realize the &quot;four freedoms&quot; on American soil. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These declarations are very touching, and Americans are indeed working very hard in practice. The boundaries drawn at the time still exist today - the recent conflict between Ukraine and Russia was caused by the US &quot;containment policy&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What I said above is to explain the cultural background of Kennan’s “containment policy”, the United States’ expectations of itself, and its efforts. From then to now, for more than seventy years, the hegemony of the United States has been presented under the discourse system of &quot;containment policy.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There was also the Cuban Missile Crisis. The Soviet Union wanted to set up a missile base in Cuba, but the United States would not allow it. Kennedy and Khrushchev confronted each other and refused to give in. Eventually the Soviet Union gave in and withdrew its missiles from Cuba. The United States still occupies Guantánamo Bay in Cuba and refuses to give it up until death: it is a prison without legal control. The spies and prisoners the United States interrogates here are not protected by any human rights laws and are forced to water and whip. , electric shock and other torture, and the body was thrown away after death. I often use the word &quot;paradox&quot; to describe this kind of behavior: the United States claims to safeguard the &quot;four freedoms&quot;, but in fact there is always such a &quot;scar&quot;, but it turns a blind eye. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1957, mankind’s first artificial satellite was successfully launched by the Soviet Union. The United States spent a lot of money and tried hard to maintain the balance of power in space. Finally, in 1969, during the Nixon era, American astronauts landed on the moon for the first time. The year before, 59 countries, including the United States, the Soviet Union, and the United Kingdom, jointly signed the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. Restricting new countries from developing nuclear weapons is a good thing for the world. As for countries that already possess nuclear weapons, it is unknown whether someone will use nuclear bombs first. Until the Reagan era, the arms competition between the United States and the Soviet Union continued, and even developed to the point where satellites could be used to carry nuclear bombs into space. The United States crushed the Soviet economy with its huge space arms race. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The previous description of U.S. foreign policy in history is used as a background to illustrate that U.S. foreign policy is the most important &quot;medicine&quot; in Sino-U.S. relations and is also intended to maintain the hegemonic thinking of Western culture and &quot;Containment&quot; thoughts. This is a very important principle for us to understand the complex chess game of the world since World War II. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Chinese in the United States under &quot;McCarthyism&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Since World War II, many Chinese students have studied in the United States, including me. We come here to study because the curriculum and equipment of American schools are among the best in the world. At this stage, the United States is indeed recruiting a large number of foreign students, and we take this opportunity to learn skills. Of course, Chinese people like to return fallen leaves to their roots. Most of the hundreds of international students who came to the United States through the &quot;Geng Geng&quot; funds in the early days returned to China, and their main jobs were either in education or industry. At that time, China&#39;s scientific and technological development was not yet mainstream, and scientific and technological talents were roughly distributed in the above two categories. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the war, with the civil war between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, China was divided into two and the straits were blocked. This became a big problem: under the &quot;containment policy&quot; stance of the &quot;containment policy&quot;, the United States would not allow students from mainland China to They return to the mainland. The most important example is Qian Xuesen. At that time, American physics was at the forefront of the world. If China wanted to develop modern technological weapons, Qian Xuesen&#39;s participation would definitely make a contribution. I believe Qian Xuesen did his best in inventing missiles. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When the &quot;Iron Curtain&quot; began to fall, the United States began to be suspicious of &quot;left-leaning&quot; people in the United States. This incident occurred during Truman&#39;s term. &quot;McCarthyism&quot; not only wanted to block those intellectuals who chose to return to China or Eastern European countries, but also wanted to eradicate &quot;left-leaning&quot; elements in the country. The so-called &quot;left leaning&quot; is defined as &quot;liberal elements&quot; - anyone who is not &quot;right&quot; is labeled as &quot;left&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The person mainly responsible for this matter is the Pacific International Society. Their surveillance network is very wide and covers all the bases for China research-Pittsburgh is okay because it is not a big base. Such a situation has made Chinese people all over the United States fearful. One day, agents from the FBI or CIA will check your correspondence and check your tax payments. Everyone was in disbelief and fearful. When I came to Pittsburgh in 1970, I saw the remnants of this phenomenon. An old overseas Chinese named Yu - he changed his name to &quot;Lin Pan&quot; when he came here because he bought the Lin family&#39;s &quot;birth certificate&quot;; our current dentist belongs to the Yu family. The old gentleman came to my office to talk. He closed the door first, then gently talked to me about their fears, and asked me in a low voice: &quot;When will this situation end?&quot; Because they have many children from their hometown who want to come out. But the &quot;Iron Curtain&quot; has dropped; there are still dozens of fellow villagers who died in foreign lands, so they have to be cremated first and wait until one day to take them back to their hometowns. Recently, Quanzi also visited the location where the ashes are stored, and there were indeed dozens of jars there. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Later, &quot;McCarthyism&quot; was subsided, and Taiwan resumed exchanges with the United States. I returned to Taiwan in 1962 and spent the next two or three years working in the History Department of my alma mater, National Taiwan University, arranging courses according to the modern scale and direction. My main job was to liaise with academic institutions and sinologists in the United States. My supervisors are Mr. Wang Shijie, president of Academia Sinica, and Mr. Li Ji, director of the Institute of History and Philology. This job is very difficult, and many people question my position: If we go to Taiwan, will it increase the United States&#39; suspicion of me? I said: &quot;I can&#39;t answer your question, but I went back, and I have no problem.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It was not until 1971, after Nixon launched &quot;ping pong diplomacy&quot; with mainland China, that there were a large number of overseas Chinese Young people and international students returned to the mainland; subsequently, a large number of international students came from the mainland as well, more than ten times more than those from Taiwan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/Wcb0MkQeDfGn11pLogqeywCkeBau6ADMYXoj9kSS.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;709&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/Wcb0MkQeDfGn11pLogqeywCkeBau6ADMYXoj9kSS.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255065&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1956, Mr. Yang Zhenning and Li Zhengdao proposed the &quot;law of non-conservation of parity&quot;; subsequently, Ms. Wu Jianxiong proved this theory through experiments - these three are world-famous physicists.

They later underwent two historic reforms: shareholding split and registration system. But for a long time, every investor has suffered from short-term bullishness and bearishness. What loopholes have been left behind by the share-trading reform that once inspired the Long Bull market? How to fix blockage? What loopholes have arisen from the registration system? How to fix it quickly? How can the positioning of China&#39;s capital market mature through changes? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the occasion of the 45th anniversary of the reform and opening up of China&#39;s financial industry, Wu Xiaoqiu, former vice president of Renmin University of China and director of the China Capital Market Research Institute, emphasized in an exclusive interview with Southern Weekend that the establishment of the Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Exchanges and the split of shares Reform and comprehensive registration-based reform are three monuments in the more than 30 years since the establishment of China&#39;s capital market. While they have achieved great success, they have also left some loopholes. These loopholes are the important institutional constraints that have caused the capital market to stagnate over the past decade. At present, regulatory authorities have realized and stepped up efforts to improve system design and plug loopholes. In the longer term, the main function of China&#39;s capital market is to transform from financing enterprises to a wealth management platform for investors, and from a financing market to an investment market. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wu Xiaoqiu is the youngest professor of economics in the history of Renmin University of China and the first doctoral supervisor in the field of securities investment in China. He has been engaged in securities teaching and research for more than 30 years. He led the compilation of the first edition of China Securities Practitioner examination materials. He is also the promoter and witness of many major reforms in the capital market, such as the share-trading reform and the registration system reform. He has made many suggestions for active capital markets. Among them, his consistent assertion that &quot;the time is not ripe for the implementation of the T+0 trading system&quot; is in line with the China Securities Regulatory Commission. The current stance is consistent. The &quot;Phaseically Tightened Securities Lending and Strategic Investors Placement and Lending of Shares&quot; notice issued by the China Securities Regulatory Commission on October 14, 2023 is also related to the loopholes in the shareholding reduction rules and systems that Wu Xiaoqiu has been paying attention to. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/raTGJwAtxKIRGrHUUoBIlw9OS03pZ4c1M2TYy5Y4.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;569&quot; height= &quot;854&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/raTGJwAtxKIRGrHUUoBIlw9OS03pZ4c1M2TYy5Y4.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255051&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Wu Xiaoqiu: former vice president of Renmin University of China; currently dean of the National Institute of Financial Research and China Capital Market Research Institute of Renmin University of China, national first-class professor, and executive director of the China Society for Finance and Banking . &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of interviewee)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;“&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Engaged in the economy&lt;/strong>;&lt; strong>;,&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Financial and Capital Market Research&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Forty&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Years”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You are a college student in the &quot;New Third Class&quot; (1977-1979).

Before college, he worked as a carpenter and later as a secretary in the county commerce bureau. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The resumption of the college entrance examination and reform and opening up changed the destiny of my life, just as it changed the destiny of thousands of my contemporaries in China. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee was held in December 1978, but the college entrance examination was resumed in 1977. Putting the resumption of the college entrance examination before the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, I think this is to prepare for reform and opening up in terms of ideology, talent, and public opinion. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The resumption of the college entrance examination is a reform in itself. It is equivalent to a fundamental adjustment of the talent training system during the ten-year &quot;Cultural Revolution&quot; period, bringing order to things.

When my father found out, he asked me to change my major. He believes that he should study at Jiangxi University of Finance and Economics. The major in national economic planning is very good and the economy may still be very important in the future. This change is also a &quot;decisive move&quot; for me personally. I later thought about my father&#39;s decision. He foresaw the future development direction of China. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In my first year of college, I got to know Sun Yefang, Yu Guangyuan, Xu Dixin, Song Tao, Dong Fuzhen and other seniors. They are monuments in my mind. The dream of a scholar and the dream of an economist have been with me since I was in college. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the postgraduate entrance examination in 1983, I ranked second overall and was admitted to the National Economic Planning major of Renmin University of China. For the National Economic Planning major, Renmin University is a palace. Later, I studied for a Ph.D. and stayed at the school to teach after graduation, and I never left. I first did economic research for about 10 years. From 1993 to 1994, I officially switched to financial research and capital market research, which now has a history of almost 30 years. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;If you don&#39;t emancipate your mind, you can&#39;t find the right path to development&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style= &quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;At the beginning of his studies (1983-1986), reform and opening up developed from rural areas to cities, urban economic system reform began, township enterprises began to sprout, and opening up to the outside world continued to expand. During this period, which reform events impressed you the most? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Wu Xiaoqiu:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;There are four things that impressed me deeply: The first time was attending an economic system reform seminar in Chaohu, Anhui. In 1985, the central government issued the &quot;Decision on Economic System Reform&quot; and launched the economic system reform that combined planning and market. It was a historic decision. I was a second-year graduate student at the time, and my supervisor, Mr. Hu Naowu, and I attended this seminar. That was my first time to participate in a national, high-level forum. It touched me greatly and expanded my horizons. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The second time was in 1985, when I participated in the Second Youth and Middle-aged Economic Forum held in Tianjin. The young people participating in the forum were active in thinking, participating in various debates, thinking about China&#39;s future, and exploring the focus of reform. I was writing an article about corporate bankruptcy. Bankruptcy is a thing of the market economy. There was no such thing as bankruptcy in China under the planned economy at that time, only &quot;shut down and transfer&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The third time in 1985, I participated in a forum held in the Great Hall of the People. That forum was hosted by Mr. Dong Fucheng, and my speech attracted the attention of Li Chengrui, then director of the National Bureau of Statistics. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The fourth time was in 1986, when I participated in another discussion meeting on economic leverage in Leshan, Sichuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I was only in my twenties at the time. It can be seen that that era gave young people many platforms and opportunities to speak freely at high-level forums held in the Great Hall of the People. This activates your mind. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Those were sparkling days, full of youthful dreams and pursuits of young people everywhere. Only when the mind is liberated can academics prosper and the country develop. Without emancipating our minds, we cannot find the right path to development. Everything must be explored, discussed and even debated before you know which is the right path. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;Cracking the mystery of China&#39;s special economic phenomenon&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: italics , Italics_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;During your doctoral studies (1987-1990), the basic line of &quot;one center, two basic points&quot; and &quot;science and technology are the primary productive forces&quot; were proposed. In the meantime, what are your views on China’s economic reform? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Wu Xiaoqiu:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;The most important thing when studying for a PhD is to learn advanced theories, study the Chinese economy, and how to solve the mystery of the special phenomena of the Chinese economy at that time. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The book that had the greatest impact on me at that time was &quot;The Economics of Shortage&quot; by the Hungarian economist János Korny. In the mid-to-late 1980s, many people read this work. &quot;Shortage Economics&quot; is a book that describes the basic characteristics of socialist economic operations under the traditional planned economic system. It is rich in strong theoretical logic, including soft budget constraints, paternalism, etc. Inspired by his thoughts, I started writing &quot;Theory of Compact Movement&quot; in 1987. &quot;The Theory of Tight Operation&quot; and my doctoral thesis &quot;Analysis of Socialist Economic Operation&quot; were published in 1991 and 1992 respectively. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Why did this book receive such special attention at that time? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Wu Xiaoqiu: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;The real value of these two books is their attempt to explain the characteristics and laws of socialist economic operation under the traditional system. Because of these two books, as well as articles and papers published in People&#39;s Daily, Guangming Daily, Economic Research and Journal of Renmin University of China, I was promoted to professor by Renmin University in 1993. That year, Renmin University made an exception and promoted five professors, and I was the youngest among them. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Transforming securities research and taking a road less traveled&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font -family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;In 1994, you were transferred to the Department of Finance and Economics as a professor in the field of securities research in finance. The following year, you became the first doctoral supervisor in the field of securities investment in my country. Since then, you have been closely associated with China&#39;s securities industry. The relationship has been developing for thirty years. Why focus on securities research from now on? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Wu Xiaoqiu:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I was already studying finance at that time, so I offered to be transferred. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are two opportunities: one is to alleviate poverty. In the early 1990s, I was about to become a professor and still lived in a Tongzi building with only 800 yuan in savings. At that time, someone gave me an idea, saying that you write a best-selling book, we will be responsible for selling it, and then give you a share. I thought of stocks and bonds. So I edited the &quot;Complete Book of Stocks and Bonds&quot;, which contained about 5 million words in two volumes. It was a great seller as soon as it was launched. Later, I was given some money, and I got out of poverty. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Because I am the editor-in-chief, people ask me to speak. This forced me to really learn securities knowledge and securities investment. This has begun to deviate from the direction of my economics research, which is entirely the study of capital markets and finance. At that time, people did not think it was a science, and even thought it was a bit &quot;crooked&quot;. An important scholar among my predecessors once talked to me. The core idea was that I should return to the mainstream track of economic research such as economic operation analysis, macroeconomics, macroeconomic management and inflation theory. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The path of securities research was a sparsely traveled path at that time. There were few professional researchers, a lot of noise, and very little rational research. But in my opinion, the more in-depth securities research is, the more valuable it is. I am one of the few people left who has done research in the early stages and is still doing front-line research now. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The then president of Renmin University, Mr. Huang Da, was a professor in the Department of Finance, so I applied to go to the Department of Finance. I taught a course on securities investment. At that time, there were not many securities investment courses offered in colleges and universities. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;I first entered the stock market both for making money and for research&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: italics , Italics_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;There was a movie called &quot;Stock Crazy&quot; in 1994, which tells the story of the various crazes caused by mass speculation in the stock market in the early days of the stock market.

The stock market has begun to enter people&#39;s lives, more and more people are investing in the stock market, and various theories, methods and stock reviews have begun to appear. Because I wrote &quot;The Complete Book of Stocks and Bonds&quot;, I also started doing research on it. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;As a research expert on securities investment, what will happen to you?

After entering, I found that practice was more profoundly helpful to my theoretical research. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;What is the difference between securities research and stock trading? &amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Wu Xiaoqiu:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;My goal in entering this market is not only to make money, but also to do research. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I set two goals for myself at that time: first, not to lose money, and to see through practical operations whether what I learned theoretically would work in practice; second, to establish a direct perceptual understanding of the research object. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Slowly, I understand the rules of securities investment and the market better. When I write textbooks, I will be more enriched and my writing will be more vivid. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During that period, I presided over the compilation of the first set of teaching materials for the securities practitioner qualification examination in China. The first edition consisted of six volumes. The general structure of the later textbooks compiled by the China Securities Regulatory Commission did not deviate from this edition. It plays a very important role in the qualification examination for securities practitioners. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Have the expectations of making money been met? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Wu Xiaoqiu:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I also wanted to catch the bull market and make a fortune.

What have you been involved in promoting? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Wu Xiaoqiu:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I participated in the share-trading reform and promoted the pilot registration system. The share-trading reform was launched in May 2005. However, since the theoretical preparation failed in 2001 when the reduction of state-owned shares failed, we began to think about how to carry out share-trading reform. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Why did the reduction of state-owned shares fail in 2001? What inspiration did it provide for the subsequent share-trading reform? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Wu Xiaoqiu:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;At that time, the regulatory agency believed that the reduction of state-owned shares could be reduced at market price, but it was hastily stopped due to the huge market reaction. Later analysis concluded that reducing state-owned stocks based on market prices lacked both logic and theoretical support, so it was bound to fail. As a result of this failure, we were reflecting on how to promote split-share reform. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During that period of reflection, the academic community organized many discussions, and I was probably one of the people who participated the most, whether in small-scale discussions hosted by the China Securities Regulatory Commission or in large-scale discussions. I participated in almost every discussion. Among them, the most impressive one was when Shang Fulin, then chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, called me one day in 2004 and discussed with me alone how to change the split share structure. Later, I went to his office many times to participate in discussions, with about ten people in a small group and twenty or thirty people in a large group. After discussion, we reached a consensus on two points. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The first point is that the split share structure reform must be promoted. If we do not promote the reform, China&#39;s capital market will have no future. This is what I also emphasize; the second point is what method should be used to reform the split-share structure reform. The design of this path is very difficult. We slowly considered that consideration reform is appropriate. Consideration reform is only a direction. It becomes more difficult to determine the appropriate consideration. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I clearly remember that during a meeting of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, Tu Guangshao, then vice chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, asked me, what do you think is the appropriate proportion of the consideration? I said 30% or 30% off, because the price of additional issuance of stock is 30% off the circulating price. This provides a reference for the consideration of the share-trading reform. Later, practice proved that the consideration plans for the share-trading reform of various listed companies fluctuated around 30% off. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;In the early days of the share-trading reform in 2005, the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock markets did not Too big a reaction. The big bull market seems to have started only after 2005. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Wu Xiaoqiu: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Yes. The share-trading reform was launched in May 2005. At that time, the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock markets had been in the doldrums for more than four years since 2001, and the market response was lukewarm. Later, the market gradually learned that this thing was serious, and more and more people had a premonition that this was an opportunity for a big bull market. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We judged at that time that the long bear market in the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock markets would be reversed during the share-trading reform process. After the reform is completed, it will lay a good foundation for the long-term healthy development of the capital market. From today&#39;s perspective, the general direction of the share-trading reform is correct. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;The share-trading reform took about two years. What shortcomings does it have? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Wu Xiaoqiu:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;From May 2005 to March 2007, 95% of listed companies completed the share-trading reform. It is a monument, but it does have flaws. This flaw is the lack of effective constraints on the reduction of major shareholders and actual controllers. This policy loophole had an important impact on the subsequent stagnation of the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock markets for more than ten years. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I have also said recently that the most important thing that seriously restricts the development of China’s capital market is the institutional design of the asset supply side. Among them, the asset supply side is mainly the reduction rules of existing assets, which is the actual Controllers and controlling shareholders do not have financial constraints to reduce their holdings, which makes it difficult for the market to grow. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;How do you think this loophole is being fixed now? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Wu Xiaoqiu:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;On August 27, 2023, there have been some amendments in the China Securities Regulatory Commission policy. This is a loophole left by the share-trading reform, and we must make up for it. Because it seriously damages the ecological chain of capital supply and demand in the capital market and causes a serious imbalance in the capital supply relationship. At present, major loopholes are being patched, so at least we know where they are. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;“&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Registration reform has had mixed effects”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt; span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;The third monument you mentioned in China’s capital market is the registration-based reform. Why start the registration system reform? &amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Wu Xiaoqiu:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;After 2007, the theoretical research, or policy formulation, that I participated in was mainly the registration system reform. Why should we carry out registration reform? Because the approval system has major flaws. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First of all, the biggest problem with the approval system is that the choice of listing a company is not left to the market, but to the Issuance Review Committee and to visible hands. The second problem is that the pricing is not market-oriented, so there is a strange phenomenon of 20 daily limit after listing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The third problem is that the regulatory body and the auditing body are not separated. The China Securities Regulatory Commission both audits and supervises. This is of course problematic. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Based on the fact that the approval system has at least these three problems, if we want to correct these three defects, we must carry out the registration system reform. In accordance with the principle of marketization, the exchange adopts a flexible system, and at the same time does not adhere to the requirement that companies to be listed must be profitable. Compared with the approval system, which requires companies to be listed to be profitable for three consecutive years, one of the biggest innovations of the registration system is that major high-tech companies that are planning to be listed are allowed to have losses in the past three years, but they must have sustainable operating capabilities. This is a major change. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;2023 is the first year of the comprehensive registration system reform. As a promoter and policy participant of the registration system reform, are you satisfied with the current results of the reform? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Wu Xiaoqiu: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Bittersweet. Fortunately, some unicorn companies and high-tech companies have become listed companies through this mechanism. Although they are losing money in the short term, they have the ability to operate sustainably. The registration system reform naturally serves specialized and high-tech innovative enterprises, and is naturally coupled with high-tech enterprises. Only under the registration system can technology and capital markets be coupled, and we will still work in this direction in the future. I think this is of great value and significance to us in promoting the development of high-tech enterprises, transforming my country&#39;s industrial structure and upgrading and iterating industries, improving the structure of listed companies, and enhancing the investment value of China&#39;s capital market. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What is worrying is the generalization of the definition of loss in the registration system. This is a serious misunderstanding, which damages market confidence and is not in line with the original meaning of the registration system. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Why does this vulnerability occur? What are the dangers of this vulnerability? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Wu Xiaoqiu:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Like the share-trading reform, the registration-based reform also has a loophole. Frankly, no one realized it at the time. Just like designing a spacecraft, there are a lot of details and a lot of sparse details. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The loophole of the registration system is that it generalizes the market-oriented functions, or it generalizes the indicators that listed companies do not strictly require profitability. So later, some listed companies seized on such a loophole and established a so-called high-tech enterprise. Under the banner of the so-called &quot;breaking the bottleneck project&quot;, they hired dozens of researchers and started to apply for IPO after two or three years. . This has done huge damage to market confidence. They do not comply with the basic spirit of the registration system, and also exceed the requirements of the risk boundaries that a public market, exchange market, and public investors can bear. The financing of this type of enterprise should mainly be completed by PE and VC, and direct IPO is not allowed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I define this loophole as: a generalized understanding of the non-profit requirement under the registration system. This is a very serious misunderstanding, which is closely related to the subsequent stagnation of the stock market. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 凯体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Is this vulnerability currently being patched? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Wu Xiaoqiu:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I once made it clear to the China Securities Regulatory Commission that the requirement that companies to be listed be unprofitable cannot be generalized. Judging from the recent IPO situation, the China Securities Regulatory Commission and exchanges have also paid special attention to the listing requirements of companies with negative financial indicators, especially those with negative net assets, negative cash flow, and negative profits. These major financial reporting indicators are all negative, and such companies cannot be listed. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;After fixing the loopholes, the registration system reform is completed What? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Wu Xiaoqiu: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Far from it. The registration-based reform is an all-round, whole-chain reform. The market-oriented reform of the issuance system is only its historical and logical starting point. It will also be followed by transactions, mergers and acquisitions, information disclosure, supervision, delisting, penalties for violations and illegal acts, legal models, etc. Adjustments in many other aspects must be incorporated into the model compatible with the registration system reform and continuously improved. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;&lt;strong>;Twin Peaks model is the ideal compromise&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong >;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;In 2022, you proposed the &quot;twin peaks model&quot; of China&#39;s financial system. What are the deep observations and thoughts behind it? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Wu Xiaoqiu:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Frankly speaking, the first thing I proposed was the &quot;single bee mode&quot;. Around 2002, I believed that China’s future financial model would be dominated by the capital market. Twenty years have passed, and I have found that the &quot;single bee model&quot; is very difficult to achieve in China. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Despite this, in the past 20 years, the scale of China&#39;s capital market has expanded relatively rapidly. From a market capitalization of two to three trillion in the past to a market capitalization of more than eighty trillion today, its proportion in the financial system has increased significantly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2022, I finally realized that China’s commercial banks play a huge role in China’s economic life, and China can only implement the bimodal model-the banking system and the capital market jointly dominate. This is an ideal compromise and a realistic situation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Why is it difficult for the capital market to become dominant? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Wu Xiaoqiu:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;The development of the capital market has not changed the dependence of the Chinese economy on currency and credit. From the perspective of the capital market itself, the stock prices of listed companies have not increased in the past 20 years, and the market index has not increased. Only the market value has expanded. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, the number of listed companies has increased from 1,000 to more than 5,300 in the past 20 years. Almost China’s largest and best companies have achieved IPOs, including many state-owned enterprises and central enterprises. and “unicorn” companies. In a sense, the function of China&#39;s stock market in facilitating enterprise financing has been realized, but it itself is a pie-spreading expansion, constantly expanding outwards without intensive cultivation, and the unit output rate of enterprises after obtaining financing is very low. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Why is our index not growing? A very important reason is to go back to the two loopholes I just mentioned, especially the first loophole, which is the reduction rule, which has a huge inhibitory effect on growth. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;China’s stock market&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Why&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;is still immature&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong >;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Our capital market has developed for more than 30 years. At the age of thirty, can it be considered a mature market? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Wu Xiaoqiu:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;China’s capital market has slowly found a basic direction in practice and reform, but it is still an immature market. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The first immaturity is that there are many loopholes in the system design. The second immaturity lies in the lack of a deep understanding of what the capital market means to China and what it means to financial reform. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past, we often said that the main purpose of establishing the stock market was to facilitate corporate financing. This is an incorrect positioning and perception. The securities market appears to be financing, but is actually investment. If you don’t continuously strengthen your investment function, financing will be unsustainable, and people will vote with their feet. If you leave, how can you raise funds? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Therefore, we need to transform China’s capital market from a financing market that facilitates corporate financing to a wealth management platform and investment market for investors. Transforming from a financing market to an investment market is our future direction. It will take a long time to achieve this goal. For institutional effects to take effect, it will take time for corresponding institutional arrangements to be put in place. Our current institutional arrangements are closing loopholes and moving closer to this aspect. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;A-shares are bullish and bearish. The main problem is the loopholes in the system design and Don’t really understand the significance of the capital market to financial reform? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Wu Xiaoqiu: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;The reason for this phenomenon in China’s capital market is not only the profound cultural and legal background, but also the misalignment of rules at the meso level. For example, there are two loopholes in the share-trading reform and the registration-based reform mentioned earlier. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, part of the reason is that our entrepreneurs do not have a deep understanding of what going public means to them. Originally, going public was a means, but these company founders suddenly discovered that it was so easy to make a fortune by going public, which was much easier than working hard in the real economy. This corroded their original intention to start a business in the past. He will take listing as his goal and stop doing the real economy. He will find a way to cash out and leave as soon as possible. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To correct this misdirection, we can only guide it through institutional reform - only by doing a good job can you cash out. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;What specific suggestions do you have for this? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Wu Xiaoqiu:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;To achieve a fundamental transformation of the functions and orientation of the capital market, the first step is to transform the overall macro-system design. On the asset supply side, the system design must be conducive to the transformation of market functions, the introduction of transparent and growth-producing assets into the market, and the attraction of more and more new investors and the entry of new funds into the market. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Secondly, we should have certain restrictions on all pre-listing shareholders reducing their shareholdings, especially controlling shareholders and actual controllers, including second shareholders, third shareholders, etc. How to use Financial indicators constrain shareholding reductions and require innovative system designs to allow all shareholders to focus their attention and efforts on how to do a good job in the company, create profits, and improve distribution. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Third, we must continue to improve the ecological environment of the capital market. Whether institutional investors or individual investors, in this market, they can obtain returns commensurate with their risks, and only then will the market grow. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;&lt;strong>;The stock market continues to not improve, and we need to come up with the right response&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;At the end of July, the central government clearly proposed to &quot;activate the capital market.&quot; What signal does this send? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Wu Xiaoqiu: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;It should be said that the supervisory authorities have seen the problem. No field in China covers such a large scope as the capital market. There are at least 200 million investors in the capital market, and behind them may be 200 million families. Almost half of the people in China have something to do with the capital market. Second, although the global capital markets have gone through the epidemic, China&#39;s capital markets among major economies have not performed well. We need to pay more attention to the problems behind it. Third, activating the capital market is also an important measure to boost market confidence. We need to come up with the right response. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;There are also many expert suggestions for activating the capital market A shares switch from T+1 to T+0. But regulators have long said the opportunity is premature. What do you think? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Wu Xiaoqiu: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;The transaction reform has no substantive significance, T+0 is not conducive to the growth of the market, and the logical basis of the T+0 reform is unclear. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First, the biggest benefit of T+0 is to securities companies. T+0 will directly lead to an increase in brokerage commissions, thereby driving the rise of brokerage stocks. The goal of our reform is not to make securities companies prosperous, and the original intention of activating the capital market is not to increase commissions. An increase in commissions will instead mean the leakage of capital market funds. As for what some people say that T+0 has a correction mechanism for market prices, I think more empirical research is needed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Second, the trading rules based on T+1 were chosen in the early days of the birth of China’s capital market and against the background of many trials and errors of trading rules. After more than 30 years of practice, they have become very mature and more Suitable for China&#39;s national conditions. I like the T+1 system very much. Why do stocks bought in the morning have to be sold in the afternoon? Since you are going to sell in the afternoon, don’t buy in the morning. The logic is very clear. If you buy it wrong, it will be the same if you sell it tomorrow. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Thirdly, the T+1 system is not unique to China and is also very mature internationally.不见得有些国家用T+0，我们也用。从我个人来说，不太喜欢T+0，因为这个制度会把人们搞得癫狂。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;南方周末：你对中国股市有信心吗？ &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;吴晓求:中国股市好起来的前提是中国经济要好起来。我一直说中国经济只要想搞好，是一定能搞好的。从本质上说，中国经济基础是好的。只要发挥市场的主导作用，适应历史的趋势，遵守市场规律，尊重企业和企业家精神，推动改革开放，走市场经济之路，中国经济就一定能搞好，怎么可能搞不好？ &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当下中国经济的问题，主要不是周期性因素带来的。我一直坚信，只要把过去45年改革开放中被证明是成功的经验坚持下去，进一步完善，中国经济就能继续保持良好趋势，中国资本市场也就有了成长基础。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 24 Oct 2023 16:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[公安部：已缉捕电信网络诈骗集团重大头目和骨干387名]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259195]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-24 15:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;In the morning of the 24th, the State Council Information Office held a series of press conferences on the theme of &quot;Authority Departments Start Talking&quot; According to the relevant person in charge of the Ministry of Public Security, since August this year, the number of telecom network fraud cases nationwide and the number of property losses caused have dropped by 24% and 20.5% respectively year-on-year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In accordance with the unified deployment of the Ministry of Public Security, local public security agencies have continued to strengthen their crackdowns and carried out in-depth special operations such as &quot;Cloud Sword&quot;, &quot;Card Break&quot;, &quot;Cut Off&quot; and &quot;Pull Out the Nail&quot;.

Guide local public security agencies to establish hierarchical and classified early warning and dissuasion mechanisms, and promote the implementation of the &quot;Xiamen Experience&quot; nationwide. Since the beginning of this year, a total of 310 million early warning instructions have been pushed to various regions, and 130 million pieces of early warning information have been independently produced by various regions; in conjunction with the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, the 12381 fraud early warning and dissuasion SMS system has been built, and a total of 640 million early warning SMS and flash messages have been sent; Together with the Cyberspace Administration of China, we built and promoted the National Anti-Fraud Center App, with a total of 15.785 million early warnings. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Ministry of Public Security and the Central Propaganda Department jointly launched the &quot;National Anti-Fraud in Action&quot; centralized publicity month activity with the theme of &quot;Don&#39;t ignore early warnings and dissuasion, pay attention to property safety&quot;.

When they went to the hotel and took apart the chandelier, they found that the camera was still there, which shocked them. People are extremely frightened when they think about it carefully. If someone is secretly photographed while staying in a hotel, what responsibility should the hotel bear? Hidden photography has been banned for many times. How can we eradicate the industrial chain behind it? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to a recent report from Guangxi TV, Mr. Hu from Nanning recently received an intimate video of himself and his fiancée staying in a hotel a year ago. When he arrived at the hotel, he discovered that the two cameras hidden in the chandelier were still there. The hotel manager said that they were also victims. There was no abnormality in other rooms after checking, and they only wanted to refund the room fee. The report attracted a lot of attention online. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;News about being secretly photographed while staying in a hotel appears frequently. Searching for &quot;hotel sneak shots&quot; on a certain search engine can yield tens of millions of related information. Recent news, in addition to the above mentioned, also appeared in Lianyungang, Jiangsu, Loudi, Hunan and other places. A few years ago, the person in charge of a hotel in Zhengzhou, Henan Province even claimed that 80% of hotels had secret cameras. In fact, hidden cameras are not only found in hotels, but also in fitting rooms of clothing stores, toilets in office buildings, and even in the toilets of high-speed trains. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These hidden cameras seriously violate the privacy of others and are undoubtedly illegal and criminal acts. If a hotel installs a camera without permission, the hotel will certainly be held responsible. But if someone else secretly installed it without the hotel’s knowledge, does the hotel need to take responsibility? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are indeed many such situations. According to industry insiders, bad guys can pretend to be guests staying in hotels, install cameras in just ten minutes at a time, and then change rooms for various reasons, and can secretly install several rooms at a time. In the case of a camera being discovered in a Lianyungang hotel, the suspect captured by the police was an unemployed person, not a hotel employee. In a guiding case released by the Supreme People&#39;s Procuratorate in 2022, criminals also secretly installed cameras in the rooms of many hotels to take photos. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this case, is it true that, as the manager of the hotel in Nanning claimed, they are also victims and do not need to bear responsibility for the infringement of their guests? Of course not. When travelers check into a hotel, they certainly regard the hotel room as a private place and have reasonable expectations for their privacy in the room. The hotel should fulfill its reasonable obligations to protect the privacy of guests. Guests were secretly photographed and their privacy was invaded, which is inseparable from the hotel&#39;s failure to fulfill its safety and security obligations. As for this hotel in Nanning, the camera is still there more than a year later, which shows how neglected management it is. If a candid camera incident occurs, the hotel will not only have to close down for rectification, but also compensate the guests. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The hotel has an obligation to protect the privacy of its guests. In fact, there are now portable detection instruments specifically for pinhole cameras on the market. As long as the hotel equips cleaning or security personnel with a set, most hidden cameras can be detected in a short time. The cost of doing this is not high. The key is that anti-candid photography should become a standard in the hotel industry and something every hotel must do, just like cleaning. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The reason why candid photography in hotels is frequently banned is because there is a black industrial chain behind it. Criminals do not secretly shoot videos for excitement, but put these secretly shot videos on the dark web and other illegal websites for sale. Some websites and social accounts use the banner of &quot;hotel secret photography&quot; to attract users to pay to watch private videos. The entire black industry of candid photography may be worth hundreds of billions of dollars every year. In the aforementioned guidance case issued by the Supreme People&#39;s Procuratorate, criminals used illegal websites, instant messaging software, etc. to publish information and sell secretly filmed private videos. In 2021, Liaoning police also eliminated a black industry chain that used hidden cameras to secretly photograph and live broadcast in hotels for profit. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to selling on the dark web, some people also use the private videos captured to extort money. At the end of 2022, after a woman in Loudi, Hunan was secretly filmed in a hotel, someone sent the video to her and extorted money. This time Mr. Hu from Nanning, Guangxi received a secretly filmed video. The other person probably did not remind him that he was secretly filmed, and it was also very possible that he was trying to blackmail him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We must intensify our crackdown on secret photography. Now that all communication accounts implement real-name systems, it shouldn&#39;t be too difficult for the police to find criminals. For those who send messages for extortion, the police can find the blackmailer through the account that sent the message, and then follow the clues to find out how the blackmailer obtained the video, as well as the customer&#39;s contact information and other private information, and eliminate the entire chain. At the same time, they can Find out whether the hotel has any issues with leaking guest privacy. After all, even if criminals secretly install cameras, it would be difficult to know the guests&#39; contact information without a hotel insider, and there would be no way to extort money. Only the secret camera was found, and the police also have the means to find the installer. The police quickly caught the suspect using the cameras of Lianyungang Hotel and the women&#39;s restroom of an office building in Tianjin. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the face of rampant candid photography, on the one hand, the police must intensify their crackdown on the black industrial chain. Management of secret photography and recording equipment must also be strengthened. Nowadays, various miniature hidden cameras can be purchased everywhere on the Internet, as well as various teaching videos on camera cracking and vulnerability exploitation, which have contributed to the proliferation of candid photography. The hotel industry should also formulate standards and incorporate anti-peeping cameras into the daily management of the industry to protect the privacy and security of guests as much as possible. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 24 Oct 2023 14:25:03 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
