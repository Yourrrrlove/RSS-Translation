Among the current Chinese women’s basketball players, four players including Han Xu, Li Yueru, Yang Liwei, and Li Meng have realized their WNBA dreams. As early as 2019, the Minnesota Lynx offered an olive branch to Li Meng, but because the national team still had a series of games at that time, she ultimately gave up the opportunity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Washington Mystics official website recorded Li Meng’s outstanding performance in 34 games in his first season in the WNBA: averaging 5.6 points, 1.1 rebounds and 1.0 assists per game.

Able to participate in the semi-finals and finals, the Chinese women&#39;s basketball team still won the silver medal. Yao Ming said in an interview after the game, &quot;The results achieved this time can be said to exceed expectations, but the growth of a team certainly does not happen overnight. In fact, many people on the team began to emerge 10 years ago, such as the main scorer. Li Meng already achieved good results when he participated in the World Youth Championship in the National Youth Team.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Meng started playing basketball at the age of 5. At first, he was rejected by the coach because he was too young and was difficult to coach. At her mother&#39;s insistence, she started practicing dribbling on the sidelines. There is a competitive side to her character. She could not grab the ball from the coach&#39;s hand. After being pointed out, she dared to &quot;fall to the ground and grab it&quot; and she actually hit the ball. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/06/ST1n4DyBXt93N6XobeOyOo1g3u4AHmZt4G1mcNti.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/06/ST1n4DyBXt93N6XobeOyOo1g3u4AHmZt4G1mcNti.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253082&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On October 5, 2023, in the women&#39;s final of the basketball event at the Hangzhou Asian Games, Chinese team player Li Meng (left) communicated with teammate Han Xu&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa; &quot;>;(Xinhua News Agency/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the age of 5, she didn’t know what basketball could bring to herself, she just thought it was fun. &quot;But when you get in touch with it slowly, you like it and it turns into love, and it continues to this day.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2010, young Li Meng became a blockbuster at the U17 Youth World Cup Basketball Tournament. At that time, the Chinese team finished third, and at the age of 15, she won the tournament&#39;s Most Valuable Player (MVP) title by averaging 15.4 points and 6.2 rebounds per game, becoming the first player in Chinese history to win this honor. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is no smooth road. Li Meng, who has just emerged, has been plagued by injuries from ruptured anterior cruciate ligaments in both legs. Injuries have always been a problem that every athlete has to overcome, but for the teenage Li Meng, it was indeed a solid blow. &quot;Actually, it was okay after the first injury, but after the second injury, I started to think about whether this path would not be suitable for me.&quot; She told her mother that she wanted to go to school, but the coach felt it was a pity and rushed Come to persuade. After months of arduous recovery, she was able to return to competition. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From 2012 to 2013, Li Meng landed in the WCBA. In his rookie season, he averaged 14.7 points, 3.9 rebounds and 1.5 assists per game, and was awarded the Rookie of the Year. In the following years, she was always the top scorer in the WCBA. However, due to her personal characteristics of strong offense and weak defense, she missed the 12-man national team roster led by Maher and missed the 2016 Rio Olympics. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/06/B2KEJKf7PkXLw1WLrhShsBHJDFvy3Wu6Vv61me5s.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;632&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/06/B2KEJKf7PkXLw1WLrhShsBHJDFvy3Wu6Vv61me5s.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253079&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On October 1, 2022, in the 2022 Women&#39;s Basketball World Cup finals in Sydney, Australia, the Chinese team lost to the United States and won the runner-up.

At 19:00 on October 5, Beijing time, the winner was announced, Can Xue lost. But this does not mean that the odds have no reference value. In fact, Norwegian writer Jon Fother ranks second after Can Xue on this odds list. Unlike Gurner, the 2021 winner, Fauser is not an unpopular choice. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the more than 100-year history of the Nobel Prize for Literature, only 17 female writers have won the prize, and 8 of them won the prize in the 21st century, including the American female poet Glück in 2020 and French female writer Ernault in 2022. Undoubtedly, the Swedish Academy, which has been questioned by public opinion, is turning its attention more and more to outstanding female authors. Therefore, Can Xue still has a good chance of winning this award in the future. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The citation for the award was &quot;for his innovative plays and essays that give voice to the ineffable&quot;. Fosse&#39;s award &quot;quite reasonably follows the tradition of the Nobel Prize in Literature not forgetting outstanding playwrights, from Maeterlinck, Shaw, and Beckett to Dario Foe, Pinter, and Handke. It is quite brilliant. Even more convincing than the list of novelists,&quot; poet and critic Liao Weitang told Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Eon Fosse is one of the most famous figures in contemporary theater and a popular candidate for the Nobel Prize in recent years. His works also cover poetry, novels, essays, children&#39;s literature and translations. Fother&#39;s plays have been staged thousands of times around the world, including &quot;The Girl on the Sofa&quot; in China in 2004 and &quot;One Summer&quot; produced by the Shanghai Dramatic Art Center. Fosse once watched his own play &quot;Somebody&#39;s Coming&quot; in Shanghai and felt that it was one of the best stage presentations of his work in the world, and he developed a respect for Chinese drama and Chinese culture. Fother&#39;s honors include the Scandinavian National Theater Award (2002), the Norwegian Arts Council Honor Award (2003), the Swedish Academy&#39;s Nordic Prize (2007), and the International Ibsen Prize (2010). ). The work &quot;New Title: Heptata 6-7&quot; was shortlisted for the 2022 International Booker Prize. Anders Olsen, chairman of the Nobel Prize Committee for Literature, said his works &quot;touch upon your deepest feelings, anxieties, insecurities, questions of life and death.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fosse was born in Haugesund on the west coast of Norway on September 29, 1959. He began his creative career at the age of twelve, which he calls &quot;ashamingly early&quot;. Fosse loved to play guitar and at one time was in a rock band. Translator Zou Lulu believes that &quot;his early musical experience brought a unique Fother-like color and style to his later writing - a strong sense of rhythm and musicality in his dramatic language.&quot; Since the late 1970s, Fosse has lived in Bergen, Norway&#39;s second largest city and the country&#39;s cultural capital. In recent years, he has also gone to southern France and Austrian towns on the outskirts of Vienna to write. Fosse is very energetic and often starts writing at four or five o&#39;clock in the afternoon and works until nine o&#39;clock the next morning. When asked if he had any advice for writing, he said: &quot;Write, don&#39;t think! Think before you write, think after you finish, but don&#39;t think about anything while writing.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;About En Fauser&#39;s earliest reading memory is a small book. In the book, a major felt that his town needed a fire truck, and then he and some citizens built it. It looked more like what children built out of wood. Car. “I used wood to build cars when I was a kid,” Fosse said. He admired Trakl, Kafka and Beckett, and at the same time, Beckett was an important object of &quot;resistance&quot; when he wrote dramas. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fosse uses a rare language, &quot;New Norwegian&quot;. Even in Norway, which has a population of only more than five million, its speakers only account for one-tenth of the total population. Fortunately, New Norwegian can be easily understood by Norwegian, Swedish, and Danish speakers. But it is with the help of translation that Fosse&#39;s works are known to more readers. Currently, his books have been translated into more than forty languages. At first, he only wanted to write poems and novels. In 1993, he was invited to write his first script because he was short of money. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Currently, there are John Fother&#39;s drama selections &quot;Somebody&#39;s Coming&quot; and &quot;Autumn Dreams&quot; published by Shanghai Translation Publishing House. Wenjing is about to publish &quot;Trilogy&quot;, one of Fosse&#39;s masterpiece novels. This work won the Nordic Council Literary Award in 2015 and demonstrates his cold, solemn and concise epic style. The novel contains three closely connected parts: &quot;Awakening&quot;, &quot;Olav&#39;s Dream&quot; and &quot;Tiredness&quot;. The story begins with the young lovers Asle and Alida leaving their hometown for Björgven (the city of Bergen). Alida is about to give birth, but the couple has difficulty finding a place to live. They later found a place to live and gave birth to a son, Sigvald, who began to adopt different names, Olav and Åsta. But someone recognized Asler, and it was very clear that Asler and Alida seemed to be carrying murder cases, although Asler might have acted out of helplessness. Asler was eventually hanged. In the last part, the story time advances to the life of Asler and Alida&#39;s daughter Ales. By this time Ales is already an old woman. She recalls her sister who died young and herself. His brother Sigvald left him when he was young...&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Wan, the editor-in-chief of &quot;Trilogy&quot;, is a young writer and translator. In her opinion, John Fother&#39;s After the work was introduced to China, it has not attracted widespread attention from readers, and even senior readers rarely know about him. &quot;Fosse is not an issue-oriented writer. He has very consistently inherited the Nordic expressionist drama tradition. His language is concise and full of tension. His profound depiction of the character&#39;s spirit and his analysis of the relationship between people have reached a very high level. He will not write about trivial daily life, but pay attention to people&#39;s mental state.&quot; Li Wan told Southern Weekend reporters, &quot;The protagonist of Fosse&#39;s work is somewhat similar to himself. He is an alcoholic. He has some mental problems and has many extreme fringe experiences. He faces his own heart very directly and exposes himself. He is a writer who can share with others the most helpless side of a person.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;With this, At the same time, Jon Fother has developed a unique style of writing. Periods are rarely used. A sentence is often very, very long. He uses many commas to connect it, giving people the feeling that the inner monologue is constantly rolling forward. This may not be the case. Due to the sensitivity of a playwright, he brings dramatic elements into the novel. In addition, he will use some repetitive sentences in different parts of the novel, but this repetition is not exactly the same, but changes with the changing context and the change of words. Subtle changes produce variations and variations, bringing a rhythm that is cyclical and constantly advancing,&quot; Li Wan said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 06 Oct 2023 11:55:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[被上司“甩锅”怎么办？当首先秉直做好自己的分内事]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258030]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-06 11:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Complaining about your boss in the workplace is a long-lasting and endless &quot;program&quot;. Regarding the question &quot;What is the most shameless sentence you have ever heard from a manager?&quot;, some netizens&#39; answers resonated: A subordinate proposed a plan, and the leader said it was no good and must be modified according to his wishes. The subordinate insisted, and the leader was angry, &quot;Listen to me. That’s fine.” There was a problem with the implementation of the leader&#39;s revised plan. The leader went to his subordinates and said, &quot;Why didn&#39;t you insist on it in the first place? You should insist on what you think is right. You have to find a way to convince me. You have no opinion at all.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p >;&quot;Why don&#39;t you persuade me properly?&quot; In essence, this sentence represents a kind of shirk of responsibility. Isn&#39;t there a saying, &quot;The merit is for oneself, the fault is for others&quot;, which refers to this kind of person. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This kind of leader is indeed the kind that easily arouses public anger. It is clear that his subordinates have opinions but their opinions are &quot;beaten to death&quot;, and they still say that others have no opinions, which is simply a hooliganism. But it’s not too weird, because he at least hinted that the subordinate’s original plan was correct, and it is extremely difficult for a leader to admit this. Leaders who do things like this are really rare nowadays. Leaders who shirk responsibility will not do it so obviously and without skills, because it is impossible to sit in this position with such a simple and crude IQ. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A situation a little more &quot;shameless&quot; than this was mentioned by a netizen: Under normal circumstances, the leader will tell you that you have messed up such a good plan of mine, how to implement it? of? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This sentence really impressed me. Yes, some leaders have this tone and taste. They are &quot;always reasonable&quot; in front of their subordinates. But this is not the best of &quot;pass-and-pass leadership&quot;. The real best is that he never says what his plan is, he just asks you to implement it, and then keeps making changes. Such leaders are either unpredictable and disdainful of mediocre plans, or they are extremely poor and like to &quot;hide their clumsiness&quot; while using their subordinates as &quot;guinea pigs&quot; for plans. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The latter situation is not uncommon in reality. To put it bluntly, some people get into important management positions without knowing how, and then start a happy life of being guided by laypeople. To be honest, I&#39;m most afraid of this. If a lay leader values ​​your talent and ability and therefore chooses to respect your plan, that&#39;s not bad. The worst thing is that he doesn&#39;t know how to pretend to understand and is stubborn and uses a lot of jokes to explain &quot; Management wisdom&quot; to force subordinates to &quot;obey&quot;. When I was young, I encountered bosses who would always say, &quot;You just need to be obedient.&quot; Ninety-nine percent of those who advocate &quot;obedience and learning&quot; are ambitious and talented bosses who love to pretend. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Relatively speaking, a leader who is &quot;overbearing&quot; but can handle things and take responsibility is much better. Those leaders who want to show leadership authority but have no structure are just &quot;dwarf&quot; leaders. The reason why they dare not take responsibility or take responsibility is because of selfishness and face. They do not have the courage to admit that they are inferior to their subordinates and are jealous of their talents. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is said that management is an art. There is nothing wrong with this, but one thing should be added: management must first be about human touch. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What follows is what should subordinates do in the face of the aforementioned leaders who love to shirk their responsibilities? In other words, where is the boundary of responsibility between superiors and subordinates in the workplace? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In any unit, superiors and subordinates are the &quot;community of goals&quot;. Considering that most units adopt a project responsibility system, superiors and subordinates should be of one mind, be capable, and be wise. Out of wisdom, in short, judging by talent. But in reality, this kind of situation is rare. In many cases, the game and internal friction between superiors and subordinates fill the time and space of a unit, which is suffocating and sighing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this regard, although the &quot;pass-through leader&quot; bears the greatest responsibility, is there no way for subordinates to reflect on it? it&#39;s not true. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In a unit, there are always the most &quot;honest people&quot;. They often just want to do things well and get paid on time. But if everything went so smoothly, there would be no such thing as &quot;workplace troubles.&quot; The biggest confusion a dutiful employee encounters is being blamed by his boss or even making things difficult for him. In this kind of environment, no matter what you do, it won&#39;t be satisfactory. Just looking at the leader&#39;s face every day is enough. In this regard, many people&#39;s bad emotions inevitably accumulate in their hearts, and there seems to be no other way except to find reliable people to complain about from time to time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But it’s useless to complain behind your back. If the leader can’t hear it, won’t it end up being scattered in the wind? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, as a subordinate, after encountering a strange leader, you are not just helpless and let others &quot;abuse&quot; you, but you can deal with it according to the actual situation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For a matter or a plan, if subordinates are not assigned responsibilities and bear the final consequences, it goes without saying that under normal circumstances, just listen to the leader. If you have a responsibility, it is your duty to do it well. If you do not do it well, you will bear the final consequences. Even if the leader puts forward opinions, they can only be used as a reference. If something is wrong, you will not blindly follow it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If the &quot;ultimate person in charge&quot; of this matter is your boss, and you are just an executor, then when you encounter the leader making an obvious mistake, you can do it in two situations. The first is to persuade when necessary, state the interests and harms, and let the leader hear the correct point of view. As for whether the leader adopts it or not, the decision lies with the leader; the second is that if the leader is stubborn, he will not only be unable to listen to different opinions, but will even put forward opinions. If the behavior is not tolerated, then it would be uninteresting to stay in such a department. Instead of being blamed and taking the blame for a long time, it is better to consider changing departments - which is equivalent to changing the leader. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Persuading leaders is indeed risky. In the workplace, there are leaders who like to put small shoes on those who give opinions, but if you are a decent subordinate, why would you dare not to give opinions? Are you just worried about what your boss will think of you? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Years ago, when I was a middle-level cadre in a company, I often gave advice to my superiors, even arguing. Sometimes, my opinions are adopted, for example, to protect employees in my department from being punished indiscriminately; sometimes, my opinions are ignored, such as when the leader handles things unfairly in the elimination of the last place, resulting in people who should not leave. Being &quot;eliminated&quot; but refusing to correct his mistakes. This kind of nest had too much to worry about, and I felt uncomfortable. After careful consideration, I chose to leave. Although I lost some visible &quot;benefits&quot; as a result, I won the respect and understanding of those who knew me. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the final analysis, if a subordinate wants to have a good relationship with his superiors in work and life, and coordinate various affairs well, it is the basic principle to be neither humble nor arrogant, and to stick to the bottom line. Without this principle, the relationship between the two parties will inevitably be distorted. A person with a strong sense of right and wrong cannot really change the adverse effects caused by insisting on the correct position, nor can he be as &quot;well-rounded&quot; as some people, but he should still insist on being an upright and outspoken person. Otherwise, even if we have achieved &quot;maximization of interests&quot;, we have lost our bottom line and character. Can we still have a clear conscience? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 06 Oct 2023 11:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[尹学芸：故乡是一枚爱人丨月是故乡明⑥]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257348]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-06 10:30:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/ 09/04/73f60a5ff76ba4f9050678f79d1cf516.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;1620&quot; data-src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/ image/21/09/04/73f60a5ff76ba4f9050678f79d1cf516.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;159101&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Reading Yin Xueyun&#39;s &quot;The Hermit Seekers Are Not Encountered&quot; for the first time, readers may feel a little confused. His novels always &quot;talk right from the beginning, without any pretense&quot;, like green seedlings growing in the ground, simple and pretty, with a fresh earthy smell. A writer who is used to writing about villages, counties, officialdom, and wine shops, How did you come up with the idea of ​​writing an urban romance novel that looks like flowers in the fog? The 2021 novel collection of the same name includes several novellas such as &quot;The Hermit Seekers Are Not Encountered&quot;, &quot;Wanghu Tower&quot;, &quot;Feeding the Ghosts&quot;, &quot;The Apple Tree&quot; and &quot;Faster Than the Wind&quot;. Continue reading, this &quot;strange&quot; novel The origins of the story are gradually revealed, and a Yin Xueyun familiar to old readers slowly emerges. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The origin of Yin Xueyun’s writing is Jizhou in the northernmost part of Tianjin City&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #888888;&quot;>; (formerly known as Ji County before 2016) &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;. There is an artificial lake in the small town, which was once an important water source for Tianjin. In the past, people often fished, took boats, and swam in the lake, but in order to protect the water source, these projects were canceled and many buildings around the lake were demolished one by one. She walked along the lake when she had nothing to do. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;&quot;The Hermit Seekers Are Not Encountered&quot; tells the story of two women, Xue Xiaoli and Su Mei, and a young man who went to an abandoned manor to search for her in &quot;pairs&quot; several times. The story of a reclusive master. The novel originated from an encounter with Yin Xueyun himself. During a stroll, she walked into an abandoned manor and saw different flowers and plants inside, as well as swings, a sports field, a fish pond, and a lake-view pavilion. The old luxury was clearly visible, and she even saw something familiar to her. man&#39;s inscription. There used to be many well-decorated sanatoriums in the small town. They were built by various departments in places close to mountains and rivers. It was difficult for ordinary people to enter, and they were later demolished. Such a manor could be hidden in the small Jizhou, and even the locals would find it difficult to find it. She guessed that this garden was also one of those sanatoriums. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/09/04/ec25f82eb0ee551da14bf69a97e2a8f0.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;800&quot; data-src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/09/04/ec25f82eb0ee551da14bf69a97e2a8f0.jpeg&quot; data-key= &quot;159102&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;There are only a few scenes in the small town. One scene can be looked back and forth, guessed, and used. This secret manor has been written by Yin Xueyun in &quot;Wanghu Tower&quot; and &quot;Looking for the Lake&quot;. Hidden people are not seen&quot;. When it is prosperous, the garden is the Wanghu Tower where retired workers from the county town spend all their money to treat guests to a meal; when it is desolate, the garden has become an elusive place for veteran cadres who are walking in official steps with their hands behind their backs. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;It seems to be her writing instinct to repeatedly salvage, wash and chew her own life without wasting a grain of inspiration. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/09/04/8ded87050634cf1d3cb1a36b522a0991.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;900&quot; height=&quot;171&quot; data-src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/09/04/8ded87050634cf1d3cb1a36b522a0991.png&quot; data-key= &quot;159097&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;&lt;span>;From Hancun to Xuncheng&lt;/span>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;&lt;span >;Jizhou is the only semi-mountainous area in Tianjin. It is high in the north and low in the south. Mountains, plains, large depressions and reservoir areas gather here. The earliest history can be traced back to the Spring and Autumn Period. There is a poem in the Ming Dynasty that goes: &quot;When you come to the west to reach the end of the mountains, you will see the city of Jizhou.&quot; Life in the mountainous areas rarely changes, and people are not good at adapting. The characters in Yin Xueyun&#39;s works all have a persistent background. Color: Sisters Li Xun and Li Quan who persisted in love and pursued light in the war-torn years in &quot;The Wind and Dust&quot;, Feng Nuo who persisted in searching for her missing friend despite opposition in &quot;The Ballad of Cai Gen&quot;, and firmly believed in the power of the apple tree in &quot;The Apple Tree&quot; Suspicious Liu Ping... Some historians told Yin Xueyun that when the Qing army entered the Pass, the people of Ji County refused to surrender until death, and were massacred three times. The character of the people here was to be cruel, sluggish, and twisted. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Jizhou is a place where obsession arises, and Yin Xueyun’s literature is also the fruit of persistence. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Some people went to visit Yin Xueyun’s village after reading her works, but were disappointed to find that the river was not that clear, the streets were not that long, and there were not always cows braying when entering the village. and fried grasshoppers. Yin Xueyun has actually seen these beauties, but the rare village she writes about is neither a peach blossom garden nor a foreign land where strange legends are born, but a place of life, with all kinds of villagers passing through, providing three meals a day. Running around and calculating, the relationships between people are intricate and intricate. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;To be precise, the village where Yin Xueyun was born and raised is in the lowest depression in southern Jizhou, surrounded by water on three sides, with only one road on the south side. The &quot;Uncle Li Hai&quot; who won her the Lu Xun Literature Prize followed this road every year and came to &quot;my&quot; house empty-handed, bringing the family a glory that only existed in their imagination, and then loaded up with everything they had cobbled together. Food and supplies go back. The friendship that never returned lasted for more than 20 years and finally overdrawn. The family kept a secret about Uncle Li Hai. Only then did &quot;I&quot; know about the humiliating life history of my uncle. He did not live in an urban community with gardens and high-rise buildings, but in a remote place. In the barren Kuli Valley, the family is extremely poor, and several members of the family wait for Uncle Li Hai to bring flour from &quot;my&quot; house every year to make dumplings for the New Year. The two families looked up to each other and secretly compared each other to get through the difficult period. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;When Yin Xueyun was a child, the days in the village moved at an almost solid speed. The only changes were who died and who got married. Some people wear the same clothes in winter and summer, but they take out the cotton wool in summer and stuff it in in winter. The village is nicknamed &quot;Nagging Village&quot; because there are many people who are not doing their job properly and enjoy good food and drink. Meat that cannot be sold in other villages will be sold here. Her parents are both farmers, and there is no one around her who is involved in writing work. She looked for the source of her literary genes, which was her grandfather who could read scripts, sing operas, and shout trumpets. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Many writers remember their reading history. She also wrote down in her notebook: &quot;Wild Fire and Spring Wind Fighting in the Ancient City&quot;, &quot;Fighting Youth&quot;, &quot;Golden Avenue&quot;...from elementary school She had memorized 147 titles of books she read from first grade to junior high school graduation. This number made her wonder if she had remembered it wrong. But in her words, these books are all about war, which may not be very nutritious for literature. When she was a teenager, she didn’t even know there were magazines in the world, let alone come into contact with foreign literature. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Even so, you must read, read one book at a time, and come out bit by bit. Because of scarcity, the memory of books is strong. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;It is not easy for rural children to get access to books, and sometimes they have to &quot;match wits and courage&quot; with their brothers and sisters. When she was a child, her sister, who was seven years older than her, loved reading and would often bring books to the house but would not read them to her. Once my sister hid a book that was said to be &quot;not suitable for children&quot;. She turned the house upside down and finally found it in an old cotton shoe. When she took the book out, she only smelled the smell of feet. When she was not at home, she took it out and read it, stuffed it back after reading it, and secretly finished reading the book about &quot;sexual intercourse&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #888888;&quot;>; (later she found out it was &quot;Song of Youth&quot; 》)&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/09/04/7f8bae790b16dddbf271186d99de917a.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;1080&quot; data-src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/09/04/7f8bae790b16dddbf271186d99de917a.jpeg&quot; data-key= &quot;159107&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;When she was not at school, she was reading a book while herding sheep. There was a lamb beside her and a copy of &quot;A Dream of Red Mansions&quot; without a book cover on her lap. The book was written in traditional Chinese characters. , she couldn’t understand it at all, but she could still remember the plot of “Second Sister You swallowed her own gold and died by herself”, and the stories in the book took root in her mind. On the way to school in the town, she walked in the wheat field with the children in the village. The children rushed to her side. She held a spindle in her hand and spun the cotton randomly pulled from the cotton field into thread, while talking about Mix books and memories with imagination to make a story, and tell it to your friends. She began to dream that one day her writing would be turned into type. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;After graduating from high school, Yin Xueyun went to work as a seamstress in a village-run garment factory. As long as she had a day off, she would go to the county town and buy ten magazines and read them all night long. She also started to contribute articles to publications after work. At the beginning, she didn&#39;t pay attention to the differences between different publications. She couldn&#39;t remember the names of the writers she read, didn&#39;t understand anything, and her manuscripts were rejected many times. Sometimes, the editor criticized her in the rejection letter for imitating a certain writer. She was confused and didn&#39;t know who the writer she was &quot;imitating&quot; was. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;At heart, she is still a farmer who relies on the weather. If it rains too much, the seedlings will grow wildly, and if there is a severe drought, there will be no harvest. The same is true for writing. There is no chance of winning awards or becoming famous. My ambition is to work step by step and write whatever comes to my mind. During this period, she relied on her innate spirituality and affection to write about life in the countryside and the ecology of the countryside, expressing those around her who were &quot;thinking of ways to live&quot;. She published publications ranging from &quot;Jixian Literature and Art&quot; to &quot;Tianjin Literature&quot; &quot;Tianjin Daily&quot;, the efforts are slowly paying off. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In the late 1980s, Yin Xueyun’s novel &quot;A Woman Called Suyue&quot; was adapted into a TV series and broadcast on CCTV. The background music of this TV series was composed of a song called &quot; Yin Xueyun was deeply moved by the sound of Xun&#39;s musical instrument and decided to use &quot;Xun&quot; to name the cities in her future works. From then on, &quot;Xun City&quot; became another literary landmark of hers. At that time, she was helping the county write county chronicles. Due to the influence of CCTV, the county party committee specially gave her a quota, and she was directly transferred from a temporary worker to a national cadre. Speaking of this, Yin Xueyun couldn&#39;t help but sigh: &quot;Literature changes destiny, it is really literature that changes destiny.&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms /medias/image/21/09/04/48d2bb4bfb153e940de848008ae8bbf9.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;810&quot; data-src=&quot;http://images.infzm .com/cms/medias/image/21/09/04/48d2bb4bfb153e940de848008ae8bbf9.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;159106&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms /medias/image/21/09/04/8f8e08f82497d537eb26d7520546f685.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;900&quot; height=&quot;171&quot; data-src=&quot;http://images.infzm .com/cms/medias/image/21/09/04/8f8e08f82497d537eb26d7520546f685.png&quot; data-key=&quot;159099&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;&lt;span>; Emerging from deep waters&lt;/span>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;From a farmer to a cadre, Yin Xueyun worked in many different departments such as the Cultural Center, the Tourism Bureau, and the Housing and Urban-Rural Development Committee, and her work exposed her to She kept a distance from all kinds of people, observed how people think and act at work, and what kind of relationships needed to be coordinated, and wrote down each and every image of grassroots cadres. In the early years, someone from her workplace warned her not to write a novel about herself. She secretly asked, &quot;Which single character can constitute a novel?&quot; She likes to let the characters wash away in the long river of time, washing away their temporary moments. They are high-spirited and disgraced, leaving behind their usually faint but real humanity, and then weave a story frame for them. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;What is different from the countryside is that the government divides people into many levels. Leaders and non-leaders, older people and younger people, and even the background behind them will be deliberately divided. Measurement and speculation, in the workplace, people always have to face many different people and deal with many different relationships. In such a complicated and tame daily life, she expands the depth of people&#39;s soul introspection. &quot;Ten Years of Farewell&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #888888;&quot;>;(published in 2015)&lt;/span>;&lt;span>; is a typical story about the transformation of human nature in agency work. This novel I started writing very early, and was left on the computer for ten years. During these ten years, Guo Yingzi, a young literary and artistic woman who &quot;always sees things with wishful thinking, cannot see any formalism, and cannot tolerate a grain of sand in her eyes&quot;, He learned to watch people&#39;s words and restrain his sharp edges, and became a well-rounded director in the office and an all-rounder at the bar. Chen Danguo, who was in a very similar situation to Yingzi at the time, could not bear the harassment from his boss and the isolation from his colleagues, so he committed suicide by jumping off the building. Chen Danguo&#39;s death made Yingzi realize that he had sunk into Accomplices also poses a thought-provoking question to readers: Does worldly success come at the cost of losing common sense and normal life? This novel resonated with many people and was recognized by the Hundred Flowers Literary Award. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Before the novel came out, Yin Xueyun also experienced a period of &quot;boiling a frog in warm water&quot; in literature. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;She has always been insensitive to fame and fortune. In her words, the author in the remote mountainous area is far away from the city and away from the vanity fair. Therefore, people are always in a state of submerging in deep water, and it is difficult to float even if they want to. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;After the 1990s, Yin Xueyun gave the impression that her writing had stopped for several years. She was still young at that time, publishing novels and essays from time to time, and running a small magazine. She went around admiring flowers, playing cards, and picnicking with authors she knew, and had a lot of fun every day. But soon she felt tired. Although there are always works being published, there are only a few publications that I regularly contact, and the novels are bumping around in a small circle, without any upward momentum. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;After walking out of the valley, as she grew older, she thought of things that she had never thought of before. &quot;You live in a place where the mountains are high and the emperor is far away. The advantage is that you are relatively free. The disadvantage is that you are relatively free and there is no one to supervise you. Later I met some writers in Hebei and I was particularly envious of them for having such a small group of three or five people who knew how to write. What&#39;s good and what&#39;s bad is. But at that time, no one saw it when I posted it in some places, and no one told you how to go.&quot; Yin Xueyun said. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Fortunately, the goodwill among grassroots writers &quot;caught&quot; her. When her novel was tepid, experienced writers gave her guidance - to publish it in an evening newspaper that was more life-oriented and had more readers. So she began to write novels for the Evening News, as well as prose and essays. The content became richer, including talking about football, reminiscing about the countryside, talking about family life, and everything in between. During that time, she went hiking every evening, thinking about writing while climbing. “Sometimes a series of topics are lined up at the back, and there is always a lot to write about. It is such a feeling that makes you feel that life is very interesting. &quot; Yin Xueyun described. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The newspaper column has a large volume of publications, and she has to publish several articles at a time. She thought of writing about the words that were slowly disappearing in the countryside where she lived. As urbanization continues to accelerate, some scenes of historical significance and local color in rural areas have become blurred. As rural people moved into the city, many dialect words that existed between the 1950s and the 1970s disappeared from people&#39;s communication, and a considerable part of them became history by the early 1980s. In order to prevent these words from disappearing quietly, she visited villages large and small in the county and dug out those words from the local population. Some words are spread over a wide area, some words are used differently in the south and the north, ancient and modern times, and some accents are difficult to imitate with words. When encountering difficult-to-grasp parts, she also discusses them with netizens from all over the world. This experience of searching on the field ridges left many memories such as &quot;opening the circle&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #888888;&quot;>; (the team had finished harvesting all the sweet potatoes, peanuts or wheat in the fields and allowed The members dig up the leftover sweet potatoes and peanuts or pick up the wheat ears left on the ground)&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;, &quot;Shinjuku&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #888888;&quot;>; (occasionally stay overnight in other people&#39;s homes)&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;, &quot;watch the green&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #888888;&quot;>;(watch the crops when they are about to mature and turn from green to yellow to prevent others from stealing them. Grain)&lt;/span>;&lt;span>; and other hundreds of rural words were recorded, and later became a book &quot;The Slowly Disappearing Rural Words&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #888888;&quot;>; (published in 2009)&lt; /span>;&lt;span>;. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;After writing essays and columns for several years, she gradually found her own writing style, and people in the entire city also knew about her. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/09/04/c460ca9c53226d3823b9f98c2f0cb4c8.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;800&quot; data-src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/09/04/c460ca9c53226d3823b9f98c2f0cb4c8.jpeg&quot; data-key= &quot;159100&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;2014 was a special year for Yin Xueyun. She published five novellas and wrote &quot;Uncle Li Hai&quot; and &quot;Ten Years of Farewell&quot; , entering the blowout period of the work. To this day, the fate of her and these works still makes her sad. At that time, a novella &quot;Linglong Tower&quot; was rejected. She could not figure out the reason for the rejection, so she gave the manuscript to Harvest magazine. Within a week, the editor called and suggested revisions. She did nothing during the months waiting for the final trial, and she doesn&#39;t know how she got here. She told herself that she would start writing after the final review, and she would stop writing after the final review failed. She was 50 years old that year, the age when female cadres leave their posts. If the manuscript had not been submitted to Harvest and had not been reviewed, she might have changed her life. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The final review was passed. After &quot;Harvest&quot; published &quot;Linglong Tower&quot;, editors approached Yin Xueyun one after another to invite manuscripts. The first thing she wrote was &quot;Uncle Lehi,&quot; but it was shelved because of space issues. She brought another manuscript to the editor for comments, but was asked to publish it. This one was &quot;Ten Years After the Farewell&quot;. &quot;I always tell my writer friends, don&#39;t worry, write slowly. When you have the chance, the work will come when it comes. Sometimes you can&#39;t find it no matter how hard you look for it. This is not just a work. What kind of era.&quot; Yin Xueyun said. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In the second year, Yin Xueyun continued to work hard and published 10 novellas, and by 2016, he had published 14 novels. She still finds the productivity of that period to be incredible. &quot;Although it was no longer the best time for creativity, you would feel that literature suddenly opened a window for you and you could seize such an opportunity. In fact, no one told you what to do at that time. But I really feel that way,” she said. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/09/04/ef2d03ef4a1659a5a7086bcd87ce3563.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;900&quot; height=&quot;171&quot; data-src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/21/09/04/ef2d03ef4a1659a5a7086bcd87ce3563.png&quot; data-key= &quot;159104&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;&lt;span>;Thirty Years of Separation&lt;/span>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h3>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>; In recent years, Yin Xueyun’s vision has crossed from the countryside to the city, focusing on the involvement, entanglement and pain between urban and rural areas. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Thirty years after she left her hometown, she wrote a horrifyingly titled &quot;Feeding the Ghosts&quot;. The protagonist Yun Ya in the novel ordered her to hide from her hometown godmother before she died. There was a &quot;ghost feeding&quot; ceremony for him at the funeral, and he hurriedly made an appointment with netizen A Xiang to travel to Yunnan. Along the way, she kept receiving urgings and entreaties from her godmother&#39;s eldest son, which made her uneasy. When she returned to Xuncheng after the trip, she followed her godmother&#39;s last wish to feed ghosts, only to realize that feeding ghosts was just a simple Buddhist ritual&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #888888;&quot;>;(&quot;Feeding ghosts&quot; Also called &quot;flaming mouth&quot;, it actually means giving relief to ghosts and giving them food to keep them full.)&lt;/span>;&lt;span>; More than three months later, Yunya received a call that her friend Axiang had died in a car accident three months ago. It was a futile exodus. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;When talking about the creation of this novel, Yin Xueyun said: &quot;Many times, hometown is like a lover. Sometimes it makes you think about how to escape, but more often , and it makes you think about ways to return. Only with contrast can there be contrast, and with contrast can there be expression of different emotions.&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Although as a grassroots worker, Yin Xueyun still I need to interact with the countryside frequently, but it is no longer the state of living in it like when I was a child, but living as a guest. As she gets older, the distance from the countryside is also widening, and there is an increasingly annoying barrier between her and the people and things in her hometown. In the past, she liked to use familiar people repeatedly in multiple works, depicting different aspects of the characters, and filling the story with details, but now it is difficult to find such people in her life. In &quot;The Hermit Seekers Are Not Encountered&quot;, the dragon of modern people has its head but not its tail, and the weak and alienated feelings between people are expressed through a large amount of blank space. The spiritual connection that lasted more than twenty years in &quot;Uncle Lehi&quot; is no longer found. &quot;Then you discover that you are actually separated from all hometowns and villages. In fact, it is not them that change, but you. Many times it is your eyes that change, or your heart that changes. I go back less and less and interact with them less and less,&quot; Yin Xueyun said. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;As a writer who specializes in rural themes, she has to be wary of this estrangement: &quot;The temperature in the works is actually receding, and the background color is fading. . I think this is a common problem among writers. Maybe every once in a while, you have to reflect on how to find a breakthrough in life. This is very important.&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: 毷体, 毷体_ GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #888888;&quot;>;(Reference materials: &quot;Impression of Yin Xueyun&quot;, &quot;Yin Xueyun: No period of life is in vain&quot;, &quot;Yin Xueyun: I have been illuminated by this lamp&quot; Liang also looks forward to it illuminating more people.&quot; &quot;Exclusive Interview&quot; Yin Xueyun: The lowest author is far away from the literary world.

Sam’s Club and Hema X membership stores have become the first choice for many people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Today, these two warehouse membership stores can not only meet consumers’ shopping needs, but also meet their needs to join in the fun and gossip, because since August, The &quot;schoolboy fight&quot; between Sam and Hema never stopped. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;High-end business wars often adopt the simplest method, that is, my product is 1 yuan lower than yours. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Previously, Sam and Hema had a &quot;fight&quot; over a piece of durian layer cake - the durian layer cake was first sold by Sam, priced at 128 yuan per piece. Hema directly lists the price at 99 yuan per piece. Sam refused to admit defeat and raised the price of durian mille-feuille to 88 yuan, Hema to 86 yuan, and Sam to 85 yuan. After several rounds, the price of the cake dropped to 79 yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Subsequently, everything from moon cakes and watermelons to egg snacks were involved in this business war. Many people wondered why Sam and Hema had a &quot;primary school student fight&quot;? Can price wars allow them to successfully attract middle-class consumers? &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;The giants have their own troubles&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Legitimate traditional supermarkets When operations are generally in trouble, warehouse membership stores with wholesale properties are developing in full swing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Warehouse membership stores adopt a mass sales model, with large packages, many categories, and favorable prices. Consumers only go for large purchases every once in a while. iiMedia Consulting data shows that the market size of the warehouse membership supermarket industry will reach 30.43 billion yuan in 2021, 33.5 billion yuan in 2022, and is expected to be close to 40 billion yuan by 2025. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;As the leading brands of warehouse membership stores in China, Sam’s Club and Hema X stores have their own successes and worries, so they have to compete vigorously. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Sam&#39;s Club has become an important growth point in Wal-Mart&#39;s performance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;According to Walmart’s second quarter data, total revenue in the second quarter was US$161.6 billion, a year-on-year increase of 5.7% or 5.4% (affected by exchange rates). Profit increased by US$500 million year-on-year, with a growth rate of 6.7%. Among them, Walmart China’s net sales were US$4.1 billion, a year-on-year increase of 21.7%, and its warehouse membership business and e-commerce business grew brilliantly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Sam&#39;s Club has firmly taken the top spot among domestic warehouse membership stores. On the one hand, in 1996, Sam opened China&#39;s first warehouse membership store in Shenzhen, transmitting the model and concept of warehouse membership to the country. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On the other hand, as a perennial number one among the world&#39;s top 500 companies, Wal-Mart has established a large and stable supply chain system around the world. Sam&#39;s Mart under Wal-Mart Member stores can get higher quality products at lower prices and pass the profits on to consumers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Sam&#39;s Club opened its first store in the United States in 1983 and has a history of 40 years. Its accumulation and experience are unmatched by other warehouse club stores. It’s hard to compare even half a century ago. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;However, Sam also has troubles, that is, there are too many imitators, competitors and even &quot;imposters&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Costco, also born in the United States, focuses on the warehousing membership model and is an old rival of Sam&#39;s. Foreign brands such as Metro and Carrefour are also chasing after it. As for domestic, Just like Yonghui, Hema, etc., are coming fiercely, especially the rising star Hema X store, which has gradually formed a serious challenge to Sam. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;For Hema, which was founded in 2015, although its history is not long, it has gone through many detours. In addition to its signature Hema fresh products, Hema Most of the previously launched Hema Station, Hema MINI, Hema Market and Hema Neighborhood have failed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Currently Hema has formed three relatively stable businesses, one is Hema Fresh Food, the other is Hema Outlet Store (discount store), and the other is warehousing membership Model Hema X store. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;This year, Alibaba launched the &quot;1+6+N&quot; organizational reform. Hema is only part of the &quot;N&quot;, and its status in the group has declined. , Hema is still one of Alibaba’s most promising businesses for listing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;It is definitely not enough to make profit from Hema Xiansheng. Therefore, the X store has become Hema’s top priority and has high hopes. In addition to opening more stores quickly, we also need to seize market share and improve profitability. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Aim at the middle class and seize the middle class&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Warehouse membership store The target customers are China&#39;s emerging middle class. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Sam&#39;s Club opened its first store in mainland China as early as 1996. However, as of 2016, there were only 16 stores in 20 years. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;With the rapid rise of China&#39;s middle class, Sam&#39;s Club has experienced explosive growth. In less than 6 years since 2017, Sam&#39;s Club has 29 new stores have been added, and there are currently 45 Sam&#39;s Club stores in mainland China, and it is expected to reach 48 by the end of this year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Another sign of the middle-class nature of a warehouse membership store is its not-cheap annual fee. For example, Sam’s ordinary membership fee is 260 yuan, and Hema X gold membership annual fee is 258 yuan. It is worth noting that the membership fee is only valid for one year and cannot be redeemed for cash. In other words, you have to spend 260 yuan before you can enter Sam&#39;s for consumption. Even if you don&#39;t buy anything at Sam&#39;s for a year, the 260 yuan is not refundable. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The membership fee threshold naturally blocks a large number of consumers, and will undoubtedly increase the shopping stickiness of paying consumers. Of course, if you apply for a membership card here, you will Come here to shop frequently so that you don&#39;t waste your membership fees. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;With its strong supply chain and bargaining power, warehouse membership stores will also strive to provide consumers with &quot;good quality, comprehensive and reasonably priced&quot; products. The membership fee is well spent. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Sam and Hema are aimed at the middle class, especially middle-class families, who have a good economic foundation and a high pursuit of quality of life. Their users Highly coincident. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;According to Yuehu iAPP, the user overlap rate of Sam and Hema reached 43.1%. In February this year, Walmart China CEO Zhu Xiaojing said in an internal speech that Sam’s only competitor may be Hema. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;This time Hema also took the lead in launching a &quot;price war&quot; against Sam. Hema&#39;s best-selling activity is called &quot;Mountain-Moving Price&quot;, a pun, which means that the Foolish Old Man Moves Mountains , also to remove Sam. This name has a strong connotation of &quot;primary school students fighting&quot;. What’s funny is that Meituan also joined the fray at one point and launched a price called “tug-of-war price.” Isn’t this “river” the same as “Hema”? &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Who can &quot;win&quot; this group of fights&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Who can &quot;win&quot; in this group war in the warehousing membership field? &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Price war alone is not the optimal solution. Not only because it is unsustainable, but also because the price war only targets a few product categories, and not all products are cheaper than the other party. More importantly, what the middle class cares about is not the difference of one or two yuan. Many people are willing to pay a higher price to buy better quality products. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;So, warehouse membership stores still have to go back to the basics: &quot;good quality, complete products, and reasonable prices&quot; - this still tests the strength and resilience of the supply chain. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Can we purchase high-quality products at lower prices globally? How long does it take from purchasing to putting it on the shelves? How to ensure that popular products on the shelves can be continuously supplied? How quickly can consumers purchase goods online and have them delivered to their doorsteps? Can you continue to provide hot-selling self-operated products? &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;They are all related to the supply chain. At this point, Sam and Costco have been established for many years and have deep roots. Hema really needs to keep catching up. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;As a local brand, Hema’s advantage is that it has more distinctive “localization” characteristics and is more in line with some of the consumer needs of Chinese people. For example, China is entering a single society, and there are more and more single middle-class people. The super large-volume sales model of Sam’s Club is not suitable for these single middle-class people. Hema’s X membership store places great emphasis on selling small packaged goods. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;China&#39;s e-commerce economy is highly developed. Hema relies on Alibaba&#39;s sound and mature logistics system, and its door-to-door delivery speed is extremely fast. On the contrary, Costco not long ago The launch of home delivery service is really long overdue. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;For another example, the sinking market is still an underdeveloped territory for warehouse membership stores. Hema’s outlet stores, which focus on discounted products and last-dated products, can be found in Taking root in first-tier cities, there is also a lot of room for imagination in sinking markets...&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;How Sam&#39;s, Hema and other warehouse membership stores should make use of their strengths and avoid their weaknesses? The best is yet to come. In any case, it is a good thing that they are fully competitive. They can help drive down prices for consumers, and consumers can also take advantage of the gossip, so why not do it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 06 Oct 2023 10:26:35 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[女子诬告强奸在新加坡被判入狱：世界性难题如何破解？丨快评]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258118]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-06 09:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;A case that occurred abroad has attracted attention. According to reports from Singapore&#39;s &quot;Lianhe Zaobao&quot; and &quot;The Straits Times&quot;, a Chinese woman Zhang Lutian (22 years old) pleaded guilty in court on October 2, admitting that she provided false information to civil servants. The judge ultimately sentenced him to five weeks in jail. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The case is not complicated: the woman involved met the man Liu Dongyang through social software in April 2021, met a month later and established a relationship in August of that year, and then lived together with Liu Dongyang. On March 9, 2022, the two had a fierce argument at Liu Dongyang&#39;s residence, and the woman involved called the police at 00:38 midnight. Facing the ten police officers, five investigators and four forensic personnel who attended the investigation, the woman in question claimed that she had been abused by Liu Dongyang and had been raped by the latter three times, and she repeated the accusation to the medical staff. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu Dongyang was questioned for a total of 44 minutes, and his two mobile phones and passport were also detained by the police. However, one month after reporting the crime, the woman involved changed her story and admitted that she had lied and withdrew the false accusation. &quot;The purpose is to get the man into trouble.&quot; The woman involved also revealed that she tried to close the case about a week after the incident, but failed. Prosecutor Kevin Liew said the defendant wasted public resources by providing false information and wronged an innocent victim, so he proposed that the judge sentence the defendant to jail for at least six weeks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Faced with the prosecution&#39;s accusations, the woman involved choked up her voice in her defense, saying that she had just turned 21 at the time of the incident, her cognitive abilities were not yet mature, and she made the mistake on impulse. Except for the victims, his actions did not cause great harm to the public interest. At that time, because she was being treated roughly by her ex-boyfriend, she was anxious to seek help so she lied about being raped by him. She has regretted the incident and has been forgiven by her ex-boyfriend, and hopes the judge will give her a lighter sentence. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The case has been settled, and the judge did give the woman a &quot;lenient sentence&quot; as she wished, changing the sentence from six to ten weeks to five weeks. However, there are still some unanswered questions in this case that deserve in-depth analysis and comment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First, the case itself shows that there are contradictions in the woman’s statements, and her defense is not convincing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The so-called &quot;cognitive bias&quot; argument of the woman involved revealed a sense of black humor, especially the sentence &quot;Inadequate understanding of legal provisions, and very poor understanding of the seriousness of her own crime.&quot; Immature&quot;. So, why did she accuse her boyfriend of rape since her &quot;cognitive immaturity&quot;? You know, rape in Singapore is a felony with a maximum prison term of 20 years and a maximum of 12 strokes of the cane. Therefore, the words and deeds of the woman involved can only be interpreted as her awareness of the consequences of the crime of rape, but are not sufficient to understand the legal consequences of falsely accusing others. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, the term &quot;cognitive bias&quot; is also commonly used in the self-defense of domestic rape or sexual assault false accusers after their secrets are revealed. In the controversial &quot;Luo Guanjun case&quot;, Liang Ying claimed that &quot;her own understanding of the legal definition of rape was skewed, which is why she wrongly accused Luo Guanjun on the Internet.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The false accuser’s self-defense of “cognitive bias” is actually unjustifiable. Judging from the &quot;little essay&quot; public opinion offensive launched by Liang Ying and the judicial offensive of the woman involved in this case, the false accuser actually has a clear understanding of the consequences of publicly accusing &quot;rape&quot;, and the purpose is to &quot;make the other party social.&quot; Death” and “causing trouble for the other party”. In other cases, false accusers have made explicit threats to “send you to jail.” Don’t the false accusers know the seriousness of the “crime of rape”? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is not difficult to imagine the mental process of the false accuser: publicly accusing the other party of sexual assault or rape, the best result is to force the other party to give up benefits or allow you to enjoy the traffic bonus, or even actually send the other party to prison. , at least destroy the other person&#39;s life; the worst result is that &quot;I remember it wrong&quot;, using reasons similar to &quot;cognitive bias&quot; to justify the false accusation, and the &quot;offensive and defensive&quot; state is enough to make oneself stand on the invincible position. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is precisely for this reason that after the woman in question spent a lot of public resources and the false accusation was confirmed, she used &quot;cognitive bias&quot; to defend the false accusation, and tried to escape from reporting the false accusation with the help of &quot;mental immaturity&quot; crime. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Secondly, this case also shows that &quot;false accusations of sexual assault or rape&quot; are a global problem. The burden of proof and the civil and criminal liabilities that the false accuser needs to bear are all related to the possible profits of a successful false accusation. Grossly disproportionate. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this case, the woman involved was ultimately charged with &quot;providing false information to public servants&quot;, and the prosecutor only emphasized her behavior of &quot;wasting a large amount of public resources&quot; in the accusation. Under Section 177 of the Penal Code of Singapore, anyone who provides false information to a public servant will be punished with a jail term of up to six months or a fine of S$5,000. However, comparing the false accusation made by the woman involved and the severe punishment that the man will face if convicted, this is seriously disproportionate to the principle of proportionality. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If similar false accusations can always achieve &quot;zero cost and high returns&quot;, and even if you report a false case and commit perjury, you will only be jailed for six weeks, then the &quot;system incentives&quot; it brings will still be Creating more false accusation cases will also harm public interest in the long run. Could it be that society can only choose one or the other between &quot;tacitly acquiescing to or even condoning false accusations&quot; and &quot;guaranteeing that real victims dare to report crimes&quot;? This is another &quot;false dilemma&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Thirdly, the person who was falsely accused failed to stand up to assert his rights and accuse the other party of criminal behavior. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Singaporean law does not include the crime of false accusation and frame-up, but there is the crime of defamation. According to Section 499 of the Singapore Penal Code, if sufficient evidence is found, the police can take action to arrest the defamation offender. The victim can also choose to file a civil lawsuit under the Defamation Act, or report the case to the police for criminal prosecution. If it can be proven that the slanderer intended, knew or had reason to believe that his words would damage the victim&#39;s reputation, he or she can initiate a complaint and recover damages. losses caused by infringement. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this case, the evidence of defamation by the woman involved is conclusive, and there is suspicion of perjury. The direct harm to the man involved was dozens of minutes of interrogation, the confiscation of his passport and mobile phone, and damage to his personality and reputation. The potential harm was a severe sentence of &quot;fixed-term imprisonment plus caning package&quot;. However, the man involved did not counter-sue the woman, but &quot;forgave her for that.&quot; In practice, this increases the risk of harming the public interest. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Take Singaporean anesthesiologist Yang Shaonan as an example. It took him four years (2017-2021) to clear his name after being falsely accused of sexual assault by a woman. However, the lengthy legal process cost him his job. Her position at the hospital cost her huge financial losses and suffered a devastating blow to her reputation. In the end, winning the lawsuit was of no help. The prosecution has yet to take any action against the woman for providing false evidence. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, as early as September 13, 2021, members of the Singapore Parliament jointly proposed that while formulating new laws to increase the penalties for sexual assault crimes, we should also seek to punish those who have been wrongly accused. protection of. To strengthen the protection of victims of false accusations, we first need to intensify the crackdown on those who falsely accuse criminals and encourage victims to come forward and make counter-complaints. We can no longer let false accusations of sexual assault become a &quot;low-cost, high-yield&quot; game and let &quot;cognition &quot;Deviation&quot; has become a shortcut for false accusers to escape guilt and reduce their crimes. As Dr. Yang Shaonan said after the truth came out: the legal system should be able to exert sufficient deterrence on those who abuse the law, while not preventing real victims of sexual crimes from coming forward bravely. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 06 Oct 2023 09:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[礼盒混装、糕点伪装……月饼何时“包装有度”？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258144]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-06 08:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/05/RS8BqslrScjLpqvROABv5zXcTRD8Yj8tDTuhfG52.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1269&quot; height=&quot;846&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/05/RS8BqslrScjLpqvROABv5zXcTRD8Yj8 tDTuhfG52. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253060&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The implementation of the new national standard can encourage manufacturers to focus on the innovation of mooncakes themselves and ban overly elaborate and complicated ones. packaging, but there are still some businesses that take advantage of loopholes, and relevant departments need to strengthen supervision. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;How many people have mooncakes for breakfast during this Mid-Autumn Festival and National Day holiday? How many people have noticed changes in the piles of mooncake gift boxes at home? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If you happen to have a mooncake gift box on hand, you might as well take a little quiz: Open the gift box. In addition to the mooncakes, does it also come with knives, forks, plates or other products? Counting outward from the packaging bag where the mooncakes are placed, can you count the four layers? If the answer is yes, then the mooncakes in front of you are very likely to violate relevant national standards due to &quot;excessive packaging&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This standard is the &quot;Restrictions on Excessive Packaging of Goods Food and Cosmetics&quot; (GB 23350-2021) revised and issued by the State Administration for Market Regulation (National Standards Administration), and will be officially implemented on September 1, 2023. The No. 1 revision of the standard further proposes regulations to restrict excessive packaging of moon cakes from four aspects: packaging void ratio, number of packaging layers, packaging cost, and mixed packaging requirements. It has been implemented on August 15, 2022. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to Modification Order No. 1, mooncakes should not be mixed with other products, and the packaging should not exceed three layers. For mooncakes with a sales price of more than 100 yuan, the proportion of packaging cost in the sales price shall not exceed 15%. At the same time, precious metals, mahogany and other precious materials must not be used in packaging materials. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After a one-year transition period, are mooncakes still over-packaged? Southern Weekend reporters randomly surveyed the mooncake gift box products on e-commerce platforms and found that the phenomenon of mixed packaging was the most prominent. Some merchants also played tricks on product descriptions to avoid relatively strict mooncake management standards. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Zhang Mengjiao, an engineer at the Beijing Haidian District Metrology and Inspection Institute, told Southern Weekend reporters that mooncakes, as a traditional Mid-Autumn Festival food, evoke images of family reunions rather than exquisite packaging. Although mooncakes have certain social attributes, Gift recipients also hope that mooncakes will be worth their money. The implementation of the new national standard can encourage manufacturers to focus on the innovation of mooncakes themselves and ban overly exquisite and complicated packaging. However, there are still some businesses that &quot;take advantage of loopholes&quot; and the relevant departments need to strengthen supervision. . &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;The hardest hit area of ​​mixed mooncakes: cultural and creative and co-branded gift boxes&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Mooncake gift boxes contain plastic knives and forks, which was once a &quot;routine practice&quot; for Cantonese-style mooncakes , after the introduction of new regulations prohibiting mixing, except for food deoxidizers and ice packs used to protect mooncakes, all products including knives and forks are not allowed to appear in mooncake gift boxes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;An investigation by Southern Weekend reporters found that there are still many mixed products in the mooncake market in 2023, with the mixed packaging of cultural and creative products and co-branded gift boxes being the most prominent. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, the well-known food brand Daoxiangcun launched a mooncake gift box co-branded with Xiaotu Shuner IP.

The gift box contains seven mooncakes and a hanging painting, with a marked price. 468 yuan (398 yuan after discount). There are two options under the product category. Although it is called &quot;Mooncake Filling Type&quot;, Dadong e-commerce customer service told Southern Weekend reporters that the mooncake types in the two gift boxes are the same. The difference lies in whether the painting received is &quot;Hundred Species of Peonies&quot; or &quot;Hundred Species of Peonies&quot;. &quot;Wu Tong Double Moon Rabbit&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to food brands, some cultural and creative customization businesses are also testing the bottom line of excessive mooncake packaging. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, a store on the Taobao platform that specializes in customized holiday souvenirs has launched a Mid-Autumn gift box that is divided into different combinations of packages.

Although three of the gift boxes are marked with the word &quot;mooncake&quot; during marketing and the food is in the shape of a traditional mooncake, in fact the products are in compliance with pastry standards. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wei Yandan, Standardization Section of Beijing Haidian District Market Supervision and Administration Bureau, told Southern Weekend reporters that the sales packaging of all food (including bulk food) and cosmetics produced, sold and imported in my country is subject to the &quot;Restrictions&quot; Requirements for Excessive Packaging of Goods Food and Cosmetics” (GB 23350-2021). Southern Weekend reporters found out that according to the No. 1 amendment, the packaging requirements for moon cakes and rice dumplings are more stringent. Except for moon cakes and rice dumplings, there are no restrictions on the mixing of other foods and cosmetics. This means that although foods such as pastries and chocolates are subject to the new national standard’s restrictions on excessive packaging, they can still be mixed with other products. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the current recommended national standard for mooncakes (GB/T 19855-2015), mooncakes are defined as using wheat flour and other cereal flour or plant flour, oil, sugar (or no added sugar) as the main raw materials It is processed into a pie crust and wrapped with various fillings. It is a traditional festival food mainly eaten during the Mid-Autumn Festival. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;In this case, if it is actually judged to be other pastries but sold as mooncakes, then the actual product may not match the description. It is necessary to further confirm whether the food sold is consistent with its labeling.&quot; Zhang Mengjiao said , usually, the product name, implementation standards, food production license number, etc. on the label of pre-packaged food can be used as the basis for judgment, or the competent department can make a comprehensive judgment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporters found that there is also a type of merchants who deliberately blur the concepts of mooncakes and pastries in their product descriptions, disguising &quot;real mooncakes&quot; as pastries in an attempt to circumvent the new national standard&#39;s requirements for mixed packaging of mooncakes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wei Yandan, Standardization Section of Beijing Haidian District Market Supervision and Administration Bureau, told Southern Weekend reporters that according to the provisions of Article 27 of the &quot;Standardization Law of the People&#39;s Republic of China&quot;, &quot;Enterprises should organize production and operation activities in accordance with standards. The products produced and services provided should comply with the technical requirements of the company&#39;s public standards.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;How to judge whether mooncakes are over-packaged? &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&quot;Inspired by &quot;The Jade Rabbit in the Toad Palace&quot;, the gift box uses hollow patterns on the front and back, and is decorated with lighting, like holding the bright moon into your arms.&quot; This introduction comes from a new Chinese-style packaging. The highlight is the mooncake gift box containing keywords such as &quot;high-end&quot; and &quot;gift-giving&quot;. The product is priced at 358 yuan and has attracted hundreds of people to buy it on the e-commerce platform. There are many buyers recommending &quot;the outer packaging is beautiful&quot; in the comment area. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As an ordinary consumer, how should we judge whether the mooncakes we buy are over-packaged? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the National Standard Modification No. 1 of the &quot;Restricting Excessive Packaging of Goods Requirements for Food and Cosmetics&quot; (GB 23350-2021), four indicators can be used to determine whether moon cakes are over-packaged: number of packaging layers, packaging Cost, mix, and packaging voids. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/05/BRKT4wkwzvaCnYeTBKnzwGGG0TXpskpIyXjuWqgw.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1039&quot; height= &quot;1503&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/05/BRKT4wkwzvaCnYeTBKnzwGGG0TXpskpIyXjuWqgw.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253062&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Liang Shuyi/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The number of packaging layers refers to the number of layers that completely wrap the contents The number of layers of packaging that can be physically separated, where complete wrapping refers to a packaging method that prevents the package from falling apart. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;If it is an open handbag, a half-pallet that fixes the contents or packaging, or a girdle outside the packaging box, it does not meet the definition of a complete package and cannot be counted as a layer. And the drawer type Packaging, even if there are two layers of drawers, is only counted as one layer of packaging. For creative mooncake packaging with exquisite and complex packaging but the number of layers meets the requirements, you can further determine whether the packaging cost is in violation,&quot; Zhang Mengjiao said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The packaging void rate is calculated based on the net content of the mooncake. The greater the net content of a single piece of mooncake, the smaller the void rate specified by the standard. For mooncakes with a single piece of net content greater than 50g, the void rate must be ≤30%. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhang Mengjiao said that due to the complicated calculation method, packaging void ratio is generally tested by technical institutions in the laboratory on random samples. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Shanghai Municipal Administration for Market Regulation told a reporter from Southern Weekend that since August 2023, the Shanghai Municipal Administration for Market Regulation has carried out excessive packaging supervision and spot checks on mooncakes sold in the city’s market, involving supermarkets and bakery chains. A total of 80 batches of mooncakes were randomly inspected at 52 production and business units, including hotels and restaurants. The main reason for mooncake packaging violations was that the packaging void rate was unqualified. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;IPG China Chief Economist Bai Wenxi told Southern Weekend reporters that cracking down on excessive packaging will help reduce consumers’ purchase costs and improve shopping experience. It can also reduce consumers’ behavior of buying high-priced mooncakes, thus reducing the price of mooncakes. Social waste. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporters learned from the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Market Regulation that consumers can use the WeChat applet &quot;Packaging Youdu&quot; developed by the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Market Regulation to enter simple information about product packaging in just 1 minute. That is, it can be preliminarily determined whether the product is suspected of excessive packaging. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 06 Oct 2023 08:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[“异域星球”墨石公园丨指尖华夏⑦]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257593]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-05 23:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Moshi Park is located at the junction of Kama Village and Zhonggu Village, Daofu Bamei Town, Garze Prefecture, Sichuan Province. &lt;span>;5&lt;/span>;
