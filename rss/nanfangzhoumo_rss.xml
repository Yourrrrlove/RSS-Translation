They were wearing body armor, holding shields, and motorcycles. The sound of the car starting kept making a loud sound, and many people gathered around to watch.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Recalling the scene a few days ago, the Nepali Mata still remembers it fresh. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On November 23, 2023, thousands of people came to Kathmandu, Nepal, to hold a large-scale demonstration. &quot;Restore the monarchy, abolish the republic,&quot; chanted protesters in Kathmandu, Nepal. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to local police estimates, about 9,000 people participated in the protest called by Durga Prasai, a former member of the Communist Party of Nepal (United Marxist-Leninist) and medical entrepreneur. Although police described the demonstration as &quot;largely peaceful,&quot; two workers suffered minor injuries. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Addressing the crowd later that afternoon, Prasai urged his supporters to break through the security cordon and march towards Maitigal. Police then used water cannon and tear gas to disperse the crowd. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As political competition between the current republic and the pro-monarchy has intensified recently, the Nepali government has deployed about 10,000 security personnel from the Nepal Police, Armed Police Force and investigators to prevent the two groups from interfering. possible conflicts. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The capital is &quot;in chaos&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Zhu Ming opened a restaurant in Nepal. He told Southern Weekend reporters that Nepal is an overall peaceful country, but in terms of certain political needs, Nepal There would be riots from time to time. Nowadays there are local police on every main street to maintain order. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The young man Kariqi remembers clearly that the protest conflict took place at an intersection in the capital. People gathered and ran at the scene, and police sirens were heard continuously. “There was the sound of some kind of gunshots being fired, and there was an obvious Smoke Trail”. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On that day, the local police fired 146 tear gas canisters and 5 rubber bullets to disperse Plase supporters in Barku. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Plasse, who claims to be a maverick and has been adhering to anti-government and anti-corruption stances in recent times, said in a speech at the rally that Prime Minister Prachanda failed to rule the country and the country was heading towards bankruptcy and demanded that &quot;He surrendered to the people.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Plasse also claimed that his supporters would continue to hold protests elsewhere and would ignore Kathmandu&#39;s ban. Earlier, the government declared the Baneshwar stretch of Maiti as a no-go zone for protests. He said his campaign would not stop until the monarchy, the Hindu state and the 1990 constitution were restored. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Plasse has long been considered a &quot;controversial&quot; businessman who is trying to overthrow Nepal&#39;s current government and calls the protests a &quot;national rescue operation.&quot; He said the protests were against the government&#39;s failure to curb anarchy, corruption and rising inflation. Prashay wanted to restore the monarchy and the Hindu state by abolishing the current federal, republican and secular institutions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He also asked for the support of businessmen in the capital at the protest site, asking them to close their businesses from November 24. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The youth wing of the Communist Party of Nepal (United Marxist-Leninist), the Rastiya Youth Party, and its student wing, the Nepal National Free Students Union, also participated in the demonstration in Tinkun. There are also many protesters who came to Kathmandu from the southern plains of Nepal. They are also &quot;victims&quot; of bank microfinance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Plasse said that banks are trying their best to exploit borrowers&#39; money and called on people to give up their loans in banks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, demonstrators supporting the current republican regime also took to the streets. They believe that only a republic can guarantee social justice and equality and &quot;allow everyone to have the opportunity to realize their dreams and pursuits.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the scene of the conflict, pro-monarchy protesters and counter-protesters clashed. The anger of the protesters spread from Barku, the designated protest area, to various areas such as Tinkunne, Garigaon, Sundara, Thapatali, Fudong and other key points. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Subsequently, Kathmandu police arrested a total of 261 protesters, set up roadblocks and water cannons on the streets, and installed closed-circuit television to monitor Praset&#39;s supporters around the clock. Police have also deployed additional sniffer dogs around the conflict site and on rooftops to ensure safety and prevent possible incidents. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, in order to prevent conflicts between rival groups, the police designated two different protest areas. But the opposition between those who support the monarchy and those who support the republic is huge and will lead to heightened tensions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, Zhu Ming said that the protests had little impact on local life. Because the protesters marched in designated areas, except for traffic closures during the march, other areas including the main business district and the World Tourist Center were not affected, and shops were open for business normally. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Political systems in conflict&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Nepal, nestled in the Himalayas, has a rich and colorful culture, natural landscape and political history. But its political system evolved over the centuries, from a feudal monarchy to a federal democratic republic. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zeng Xiangyu, an associate researcher at the Institute of South Asia at Sichuan University, said that the current republic has indeed achieved certain positive results since its establishment, including the expansion of people&#39;s democratic rights and more protections. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As early as the beginning of the 21st century, Nepalese politics underwent major changes. In 2006, Nepal&#39;s civil war ended and the government and rebels signed a peace agreement. Two years later, in 2008, Nepal officially declared itself a federal democratic republic, abolished the monarchy, the head of state became the president, and power was dispersed among the central government, federal state governments, and local governments. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, the Nepali government began to formulate a new constitution and established a federal system. Nepal is divided into seven federal states, each of which has a certain degree of autonomy and is responsible for managing its own affairs. This constitution-making process went through many political crises and protests, but was finally adopted in 2015 and became the current constitution. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“There are mainly two groups of people who are dissatisfied with the republic.” Zeng Xiangyu said that one group of people are young people who have grown up with modern education and have more expectations for the country. Another group of people are those who have experienced the monarchy era. They believe that although the monarchy has many shortcomings, politicians can at least compete within a limited range and achieve general stability. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zeng Xiangyu said that modern politics in Nepal is still in the process of being cultivated. The current chaos is not due to problems with the political system itself, but due to problems with the politician class, which leads to the operation of the current system. There are many problems and there is a lot of dissatisfaction. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Political instability has plagued Nepal since the end of the monarchy, with more than a dozen changes of government. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zeng Xiangyu said that although there is currently no situation similar to previous civil wars in Nepal, the political arena has long been trapped in party disputes and the political situation has been unstable for a long time. Political parties continue to divide and change their policies, leaving voters disappointed. Voters hope to establish a stable government through elections and put the country on the right track, but politicians often use votes as bargaining chips in party political negotiations, causing strong dissatisfaction among voters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Politically unstable and economic development has slowed, millions of young people have left the country in search of work. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zeng Xiangyu told Southern Weekend reporters that Nepal’s economic development has been slowing down and the people are in an extremely confused and trapped state. Many people who study abroad or are active abroad are unwilling to come back. Some young people prefer to work in the Gulf or India. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The recent protests have also shown the disputes and differences within Nepali society over the political system. Clearly, Nepali politics still faces some challenges and problems. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhu Ming sometimes &quot;chats&quot; with protesters. He said the protesters&#39; real demand was a return to the days of king power. &quot;Because only the king will think about the people.&quot; He said that the protesters believe that no matter which party they are, they represent their own interests and will be bribed by different international forces. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“There are many political forces in Nepal, behind which are the behind-the-scenes interest transactions of various political parties.” Zeng Xiangyu believes that although this is a shortcoming of the current republican system, it is different from the previous fierce confrontation or civil war era. Than, &quot;It&#39;s always better&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Are the &quot;curry smell&quot; protests effective? &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;This is not the first time that conflicts and violent protests have occurred. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Kathmandu police said that on the afternoon of September 7, 2023, 47-year-old Shyam Sapkota attacked Yadav, co-general secretary of the Nepali Congress Party, in Kathmandu. He suffered deep cuts on the back of his neck and was taken to hospital for treatment by police. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the incident, a video circulated on social media showed Sapkota shouting for the restoration of the country&#39;s monarchy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In December 2020, pro-monarchy and pro-Hindu activists marched on the streets of Kathmandu, demanding the restoration of the monarchy and Nepal as a Hindu country, and the abolition of the federal system. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Controversy over the constitutional system has always existed. It has been dragged on for many years and has not yet been completely resolved.&quot; Zeng Xiangyu said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is noteworthy that Nepal is a multi-ethnic country, and there are tensions and differences between different ethnic and social groups. Some local people are dissatisfied with the federal demarcation and distribution of autonomy, which has led to protests and political unrest. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zeng Xiangyu analyzed that as a federal country in Nepal, the relationship between the central government and the provinces, as well as how to name the provinces and where the capital is located, are all issues that have caused huge controversy. &quot;In the era of the king, there were As the controversial issue continues to this day, the controversy becomes even greater.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Currently, Nepal&#39;s political status quo remains turbulent. There are serious differences in political philosophy between supporters of the monarchy and the republic. This opposition is not limited to ideology, but also involves the people&#39;s views on the future of the country. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Nepal&#39;s political parties, especially the mainstream political parties, are dividing and forming groups very quickly, and they focus entirely on political interests.&quot; Zeng Xiangyu commented that each political party does not regard specific policies that are beneficial to the country as its work Instead, he is keen on party struggle. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before the march, Zhu Ming asked those participating in the protest &quot;whether they will succeed.&quot; The answer he got was &quot;yes.&quot; But judging from the current results, &quot;there is a high probability that it has not achieved its goal.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zeng Xiangyu said that Nepal’s political situation will not undergo major fluctuations due to this protest, and will continue on its original track. Several political parties are divided into groups, and for the sake of political interests, they will continue to &quot;you sing and I will &quot;Debut&quot;, there will be no major breakthroughs in economic and social development for the time being. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Democracy and republic cannot make mistakes.” Regarding this protest, Chairman of the Communist Party of Nepal (United Marxist-Leninist) Oli said that individual people in power may make mistakes, but this does not mean that the entire system is defective . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Oli said the restoration of the monarchy was unthinkable. Just as humans cannot go back to the Stone Age, we cannot go back to monarchy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;The goals of the protesters are impossible to achieve.&quot; Zeng Xiangyu analyzed that the monarchy is a thing of the past and does not conform to the trend of the times. It is more of an emotional expression and a reflection of the status quo. protest. &quot;It is almost impossible to achieve the goal of restoring the monarchy.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, this kind of protest may be an opportunity for Nepal. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“This is a reminder to Nepal’s political class.” Zeng Xiangyu said, “More than ten years have passed, and the people will miss the monarchy and vent their dissatisfaction with the status quo, which is worthwhile in itself. Reflection. In Nepal, there are now some emerging political parties that represent the voices of young people and have achieved good results. But if they want to replace traditional political parties, they still have a long way to go.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx .net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.run&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.run&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt; /div>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 03 Dec 2023 16:55:07 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[王贤才丨两次焚稿，九译其书：我翻译《希氏内科学》的历程]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261714]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-12-03 15:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/ image/23/12/02/e8b0f8c820.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;1611&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/ 02/e8b0f8c820.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;260450&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;At the beginning of this century, Wang Xiancai and his wife Zeng Hanying revisited their birthplace. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;My ancestral home is Yongan Township, Jiujiang County, Jiangxi Province. In the 1920s, my grandfather moved the family to Shanghai. In the 22nd year of the Republic of China (1933)&lt;/span>; the sixteenth day of the ninth lunar month, I was born in &quot;Jianye Lane&quot;, Fululi Road, &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>;(now Jianguo West Road)&lt;/span>; in the French Concession in Shanghai. October 30, 2023 is my 90th birthday. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When my wife Zeng Hanying and I revisited our former residence at the beginning of this century, Jianyeli had become a dilapidated building and was about to be demolished and rebuilt, and the residents had all moved out. The guard asked about the purpose of his visit and allowed me, an old resident, to go in and walk around, leaving this photo at the door of the alley. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the autumn of 1946, I returned to Jiujiang with my parents and lived in the ancestral house bought by my grandfather on Dutian Lane. It was an old house with two front and back floors. When Jiujiang was liberated in May 1949, I was a freshman in Tongwen Middle School. In the spring of 1951, when he was about to enter his junior year of high school, he was ordered to study at the Central South Youth League School in Wuhan &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, Kaiti_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>; (Jiangxi Province was then part of the Central South District)&lt;/span>;. When I returned from graduation in July, the Communist Youth League Committee asked me to stay in the student department and formally join the workforce. The pace of life slows down. I was not used to the life of a government cadre. At this time, the first unified entrance examination for colleges and universities across the country had passed. Suddenly I found that Shandong University School of Medicine had to recruit students separately, so I asked to resign and study further. The student minister agreed, but the organization minister believed that this was caused by bourgeois individualism, and he refused to obey the organization&#39;s decision and ordered him to &quot;resign&quot; from the group. This was the first political blow I suffered and became my “original sin.” People of insight believe that the ups and downs I experienced in the first half of my life were all related to this. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After being forced to &quot;resign&quot; from the group, he bid farewell to his parents, sadly left home, and went to Qingdao to successfully enter the School of Medicine at Shanda University. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/02/6f4d1658ee.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;1541&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/02/6f4d1658ee.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;260451&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Registration photo for Shandong University. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Although I have never thought about studying medicine, I have to do this, otherwise I will have to wait another year. Later I discovered that this passively accepted major also protected me to a great extent. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Because I paid a heavy price to get the opportunity to enter a higher education, I learned from the experience and worked harder than ever before. At that time, there were no textbooks in the university, so I mainly relied on taking notes during class. I listened attentively, requiring myself not only to understand, but also to remember in class. After class, I compiled notes from memory, and then supplemented them with Chinese and foreign materials I read in the library, so I learned more than what I heard in class. of more. I was the first in the class in every test score in all courses during college. Mr. Lu Yunming, professor of Physiology, made an exception and gave me 110 points on the 100% test paper because my answer exceeded what he taught in class. Thirty years later, I returned to Qingdao to attend the school anniversary event, and Mr. Lu happily mentioned this to me. Importantly, I also started my medical translation career at Shandong University. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/02/729c561658.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;700&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/02/729c561658.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;260452&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;While studying at Shandong University, I took photos on the Qingdao beachfront. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After entering the clinical course, I learned that there is a world-renowned medical masterpiece &quot;His Internal Medicine&quot; in the United States. The teachers jokingly called it the &quot;Das Kapital&quot; of clinical medicine. I went to the school library to register and queue up, and borrowed this heavy masterpiece. While reading and studying, I was deeply impressed by its profoundness, systematic and rigorous discussion, and its emphasis on the connection between clinical and basic theory, so I came up with the idea of ​​translating it into Chinese. I think this is a very meaningful thing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step. I want to do it in two steps: first translate a smaller book, and then move on to that big book after gaining experience. Later, I chose &quot;An Approach to Clinical Surgery&lt;/em>;&quot; (&lt;em>;An Approach to Clinical Surgery&lt;/em>;) written by Professor HC Owens of the United Kingdom for interns and junior residents. I felt that the content of this book was It&#39;s something I can control. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, whether I wanted to translate &quot;His Internal Medicine&quot; or tried to translate this booklet, it was still a secret of mine at that time. There was only one close friend in the same class&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: italics, italics _GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>;(Liu Piren)&lt;/span>;Knowing this, he has always been optimistic about me and encouraged me, and even found a &quot;secret&quot; translation place for me, which is the small building on the roof of the third surgical ward. attic. It was a low, cramped small room covered with cobwebs and dust. I had to bend down to get in. The &quot;tables&quot; are stacked soap boxes, sitting on bricks wrapped in newspaper. I get up early every morning and hide here to translate books. There was no electricity in the attic, so candles were the only way to light it. My eyesight is not good. When I look closely, I often smell a burning smell, which means my hair is burning. I work until six or seven o&#39;clock and quietly return to the dormitory, keeping up with the rhythm of life of my classmates, washing, eating, and going to the ward together. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/02/e53a0d5f09.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;1662&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/02/e53a0d5f09.png&quot; data-key=&quot;260453&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Photos from the time when I was secretly translating books in the attic. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I kept a low profile and did a good job of keeping it secret. Until I finished translating this little book of more than 200,000 words, no one discovered my &quot;underground activities.&quot; In 1993, I returned to Qingdao to attend the anniversary event of my alma mater. Liu Jingru, my classmate who lived in the bunk below me at that time, &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>;(then the director of Qingdao Municipal Health Bureau)&lt;/ span>;Admitted that he had no idea about these activities of mine at that time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/02/400851e4cb.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;1676&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/02/400851e4cb.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;260454&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In 1993, he returned to Qingdao Medical University to participate in the school anniversary event and took a photo with his old classmate Liu Jingru (middle) who was the director of Qingdao Health Bureau at the time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When &quot;Instructions for Clinical Surgery&quot; was published by Shanghai Health Publishing House in 1957, I had already graduated and was working in Beijing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/02/cf8354f25c.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;1078&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/02/cf8354f25c.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;260455&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;After this little book was published, I went through many ups and downs and almost lost everything. This is a used book I bought online. I accidentally found it on a used book website. At least it is still good. There have been three reprints: Shanghai Science and Technology Press (1960, 1961) and Hong Kong Commercial Press (1970). &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Enter &quot;His&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The publication of &quot;Instructions for Clinical Surgery&quot; gave me great encouragement. I bought back the 9th edition of &quot;His Internal Medicine&quot; and began to It marches on. This translation is not an &quot;underground activity&quot;. My colleagues all know that I am doing it. But I was unlucky, and soon the anti-rightist movement came. Although I got through 1957, the year when I became famous, without incident, because the hospital’s anti-rightist goals were not fulfilled, in June 1958, I was still classified as a rightist for “unreasonable opinions” on Soviet medicine. By this time, the anti-rightist climax had passed, and I and two other right-wing recruits were not sent out. We stayed in the hospital to supervise labor and were given a monthly living allowance of 32 yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Two months later, the hospital was suddenly ordered to move to Hohhot, Inner Mongolia to support the local Great Leap Forward. The pressure I feel is also increasing. Finally, on a bright and clear night, the translated manuscript of the 9th edition of &quot;His&quot;, about 400,000 words, was burned in a wasteland next to the hospital. Although I felt very miserable, I could still convince myself that now was not the time to translate the book, and I had to work hard to take off this &quot;hat&quot; on my head. Science is always evolving, and a new version will come out when the time comes, and I will start over. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since 1960, I have been ordered to act as &quot;acting attending physician&quot;. Every morning, I lead the residents and interns in ward rounds. At this time, I am their superior. After the ward rounds, they return to the office and I sweep the floor, clean the tables, and empty the toilets for the patients. Whatever patients need me to do and I can do, I do it proactively. Because I am different from them, I am a right-winger under supervision. At that time, they were the enemies of the people, the &quot;reactionaries&quot;. So what I think about day and night and think about in my heart is &quot;taking off my hat&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Looking forward to the stars, looking forward to the moon, and finally looking forward to this day. In November 1961, the Party Committee of the Academy announced that I would be &quot;retired&quot;. At this time, the situation also changed a lot: the Soviet Union became the &quot;Soviet revisionist&quot; and the target of our criticism, and was no longer the &quot;big brother&quot;. I returned to my old business, bought the 11th edition of &quot;His&quot;, and started to study &quot;His&quot; again. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But as luck would have it, the &quot;Four Cleanups&quot; movement came again. The leader of the working group leading the movement warned me: Don’t relapse, as the “rightist” label can be put back on again after you take it off! These words hit home for me. I have to pull back from the brink! Finally, the re-translated 11th edition of the manuscript of &quot;His&quot; &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>; (also more than 400,000 words)&lt;/span>; was placed next to the hospital. The wasteland was set on fire. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A famous person once said that the most painful thing in life is waking up from a dream with no way out. When I am wearing the &quot;hat&quot;, I can dream about doing it again after taking off the &quot;hat&quot;. What path can I take now, what can I dream about? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Life is sometimes cruel but also interesting: more than twenty years later, I was invited to return to Hohhot. When I was discussing with scientific and technical personnel in the Inner Mongolia Science and Technology Building, I discovered that this building is the same hospital where I used to work. Next, it was built on the wasteland where I burned manuscripts twice. I couldn’t help but tell them about this past event. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Upgrade again&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Four Clean-ups&quot; movement has not yet completely ended, but it has entered a decade of catastrophe. I was punished as a &quot;rightist without hats&quot; and upgraded to an &quot;active counterrevolutionary&quot;. I was sentenced to 12 years in prison, deprived of political rights for 4 years, and entered a labor camp. Fortunately, the authorities took advantage of my skills and allowed me to serve my sentence in the health department of the labor camp, avoiding regular labor. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1971, Cheng Dalu, a fellow prisoner who was released after serving his sentence, gave me a tightly wrapped &quot;gift&quot;. When I opened it, I saw that it was the 13th edition of &quot;His Internal Medicine&quot;! Cheng Dalu was an educated youth from Shanghai who was transferred to Shanxi. He was sentenced to five years in prison for &quot;counterrevolutionary&quot; crimes. He was hospitalized here for a long time because of pleurisy. We get along well. He knew that I was determined to translate &quot;His Internal Medicine&quot; and kept it in mind. At that time, it was stipulated that people who lived in big cities and along the coast could not go home after release and had to stay in the factory >;Employment. So he could take advantage of the fact that every day after the prisoners went to work and there were no guards in the cell, he could send me books. Cheng Dalu only has a &quot;salary&quot; of 29 yuan per month, and he also has to support his younger sister who is sent to Anhui. But after he discovered the newly released &quot;His Internal Medicine&quot; (photocopy) in a foreign language bookstore, he tried every means and sold his clothes to buy it for me. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/02/b574c980bd.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;579&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/02/b574c980bd.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;260456&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In 1984, we met again after the robbery on Hechengda Road in Jiujiang (left in the picture). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Suddenly I saw the long-lost &quot;He&quot;, things have changed and people have changed, and the feeling in my heart is really indescribable. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the prisoners go to work every day, they eat lunch at the construction site and do not return from work until 6 p.m. So I can read a book after I finish handling the affairs in the ward in the morning, and I can calm down by eight or nine o&#39;clock after I finish handling the patients sent by each team for consultation in the evening. I looked through the 13th edition of &quot;His&quot; and found that with the advancement of the times, the content is very different from previous editions. His Majesty himself has long since retired. There are 177 authors of this book. The chief editor is Professor Paul B. Beeson of Oxford University (later transferred to the University of Washington in the United States). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/02/c79b574a0b.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;1437&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/02/c79b574a0b.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;260457&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;A signed photo given to me by Bison, chief editor of the 13th, 14th and 15th editions of &quot;His Internal Medicine&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Translating books in prison&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;I can’t help but want to use this opportunity to translate books. I didn&#39;t do it impulsively or whimsically, but after careful consideration and serious consideration. Since I arrived at the labor camp, I have been conscientious and cautious in my work. I have never made any mistakes or had any medical accidents. Analytical balances, photoelectric colorimeter, and laboratory were established to perform clinical and biochemical tests carried out in general hospitals at the time One year&#39;s reward)&lt;/span>;, so the leader trusts me very much. I think I can win the support of the leadership. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to regulations, cadres are not allowed to come to see me for medical treatment. However, starting from the factory leader and political commissar Li Hengwen, they often come to see me for medical treatment. Of course, I have no right to refuse. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Political Commissar Li came to see me again that day. He was about fifty years old at the time, a veteran anti-Japanese cadre and former public security chief. He often suffers from a slow heart rate and the cause is unknown. After careful examination and examination, I thought it was a manifestation of coronary heart disease. At that time when supplies were in short supply and people were generally malnourished, coronary heart disease was still very rare in China. Large hospitals occasionally saw a few cases of coronary heart disease and myocardial infarction, and the papers they wrote could be published in national academic journals. Doctors have little experience with this and have difficulty accessing foreign medical information. Later, hospitals outside the hospital also recognized my diagnosis, which also increased Political Commissar Li&#39;s trust in me and asked me how I came to have coronary heart disease from a slow heart rate. I took the opportunity to bring out the big book and said that it was what it told me and I wanted to translate it so that more Chinese doctors could read it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Commissar Li flipped through the big book but did not answer me. No words were spoken for a long time. I felt a little uneasy and should not have presumed to make this request. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He closed the book and said to me: &quot;Since it is such a good book, you can translate it here. We support you. If the translation cannot be published, we will print it for you!&quot; ”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;That’s what he said, and I still remember it vividly. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Learning &quot;Dumb Japanese&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In this way, I translated &quot;His Internal Medicine&quot; for the third time in the labor camp, hoping to realize my wish as a student. Translating books in such a closed environment naturally presents many difficulties. Although there were many capable people among the reform-through-labor prisoners during that period, it was still difficult to find anyone to discuss the more professional issues. I remember that when I translated a piece of content about CT, I got stuck. Nowadays, CT is a household name, but at that time, CT had just come out. I couldn&#39;t guess from the two English words &quot;computerized tomography&quot; what this &quot;artifact&quot; for examination, referred to as CT, was , SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>;(literally &quot;computer-processed tomography&quot;)&lt;/span>;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Take a message from prisoners in this city and ask their families to help find explanatory materials about CT. I finally found a copy and sent it in, but it was in Japanese. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There happens to be a Japanese expert in the ward: Mr. Luo Yuanzhen, professor of the Department of History of Shanxi University. Mr. Luo studied at Waseda University in Japan in his early years and married a Japanese lady &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>; (suspected to be a &quot;Japanese spy&quot;)&lt;/span>;. He is a &quot;future&quot; &quot;Convicted criminals&quot; were also sent as the detention center was overcrowded. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But Mr. Luo, who is separated by lines and is proficient in Japanese, cannot read the Japanese information about CT, saying that you can only read it yourself; if you don’t understand Japanese, you can learn it. I&#39;m still a little hesitant: Is it too much to learn a foreign language just to read some Japanese information? Mr. Luo said that it can be done quickly: learn &quot;dumb Japanese&quot; and just read books, not speak or write articles, it only takes a few months. In that environment, there was no choice but this. So the translation was suspended and I started learning Japanese with Mr. Luo. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/02/0f3bf689c9.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;1467&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/02/0f3bf689c9.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;260458&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;My Japanese teacher in prison, Mr. Luo Yuanzhen (1906-1993), a professor at Shanxi University. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After daily rounds, I invite Mr. Luo to my room &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>; (should be said &quot;prison unit&quot;)&lt;/ span>;Come and learn Japanese. In less than a month, the &quot;dumb Japanese&quot; mastered Japanese and understood the Japanese information about CT, and then returned to the translation of &quot;His&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On a night in late September 1975, the entire 13th edition of &quot;Historical Records&quot; &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>; (3.4 million words)&lt; /span>;The Chinese translation is finally completed. I put the final translation I wrote into the translated manuscript. There are 300 words per page, and the pages are numbered to more than 11,000 pages. The numbering is like a small mountain, trembling. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;My wish as a student has finally come true, but time has passed and I am no longer young. I am still translating books under such circumstances, which is sad! Although I can feel a little relieved that my long-cherished wish has finally come true, almost at the same time, another indescribable sadness has penetrated my body and mind: Will I be forced to burn them again...&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;It was late at night and the prison cell was silent. My place is very close to the big wall. I can see the high-voltage wires rustling in the wind on the high wall and the sentries on the watchtowers with guns and live ammunition...&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Change of sentence and release&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Complete translation of &quot; Less than ten days after the 13th edition of &quot;His Internal Medicine&quot;, my life faced another major change: the Inner Mongolia High Court decided to revoke my original sentence and change my sentence to eight years! This is the result of Comrade Xiaoping&#39;s second comeback and his proposal to rectify all walks of life based on Mao Zedong&#39;s &quot;Three Instructions.&quot; I was arrested and sentenced in 1967. Based on this calculation, I have already served 8 years in prison, so I decided to commute my sentence to 8 years. But they don&#39;t understand that my sentence has been reduced by one year. It would be more &quot;appropriate&quot; and &quot;accurate&quot; if my sentence was reduced to nine years. The day the sentence modification was issued was September 27, 1975. Just sit as much as you like. There was no talk of state compensation at that time, and I had nothing to say. The labor camp decided to release him and allowed me to take away all the translations of the 13th edition of &quot;His Internal Medicine&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/02/bed71ffd4f.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;606&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/02/bed71ffd4f.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;260459&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The 3.4 million-word manuscript of the 13th edition of &quot;His Internal Medicine&quot; was translated in prison and is now in the Jiujiang Museum. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I returned to my hometown of Jiujiang and lived with my mother. Soon I was hired as a temporary worker in a factory hospital &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 毷体, 凯体_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>;(doctor)&lt;/span>;, earning 34.5 yuan per month. At this time, the 14th edition of &quot;He&quot; became available. I bought it back and used it to compare, update, and supplement the translation of the 13th edition. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In December 1978, the Party Central Committee held the historic Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, which changed from &quot;class struggle as the key link&quot; to economic construction as the center. The central government issued Document No. 55, which &quot;removed&quot; right-wing elements across the country. Any wrong demarcations would be corrected and they would lose their job arrangements. I was placed in Jiujiang Second People&#39;s Hospital. However, corrections and vindication must be done by the original unit. So in 1980, I returned to my original workplace in Inner Mongolia. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Signed for publication&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The corrections by the rightists and the redress of injustices went smoothly, and there was an unexpected surprise: because my injustices were all during the catastrophe, according to regulations, all the wages that were deducted and fined at that time were It can be reissued, so I suddenly became a “10,000-yuan household”! This was a huge amount of money at the time. While I was waiting for the step-by-step approval, I went to the Inner Mongolia People&#39;s Publishing House to inquire about publishing matters for a friend&#39;s book manuscript. The editor who received me, Xu Cheng, is the deputy director in charge of the science and technology editorial office. Xu Cheng was not interested in his friend&#39;s manuscript and asked casually: Are there any other manuscripts? I also replied casually: &quot;Are you interested in the big manuscript? &quot;His Internal Medicine&quot;.&quot; Unexpectedly, Xu Cheng&#39;s eyes lit up and he became more energetic. He asked me carefully about the manuscript and my situation, and asked me to give him some time. More than 20 days later, Xu Cheng came to me to sign a contract and said that they decided to publish it in 10 volumes one after another, all in three years! &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xu Cheng’s words shocked me: Is this such a big decision for such a big book? We have never met each other, how can he trust me? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It turns out that he has done a lot of work around this book these days: he knew that I was a doctor and found out that I was famous in Inner Mongolia back then; he retrieved the book I translated in the early years from the library. I have carefully read the &quot;Instructions for Clinical Surgery&quot;; I also held two symposiums, one of which was specially held in Beijing to solicit the opinions of participating experts on the publication of &quot;His Internal Medicine&quot; and received unanimous affirmation and support. , then reported to the leader and asked me to sign a contract. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I think the more important reason should be: Reform and opening up, many wastes are waiting to be done, and people are eager to understand the outside world. However, after these years of hard work, English talents are rare and there are not many left. I finally It came to life, and there was this ready-made translation. This is my luck, in fact, it is also my fluke. Despite this, I still admire Xu Cheng&#39;s professionalism very much. He is 12 years younger than me and graduated from the Biology Department of Inner Mongolia University in 1966. From then on, he and I became lifelong friends. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/02/1499da72df.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;871&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/02/1499da72df.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;260460&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Xu Cheng (right in the picture) and I discussed the publication of &quot;His Internal Medicine&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When I returned to Jiujiang, I immediately sent the first translation of &quot;Volume 5&quot; on cardiovascular disease to Xu Cheng. At that time, printing was still the age of lead type. I chose to publish this volume first, not because I am a doctor in this profession, but because of Xu Cheng’s marketing considerations: there are many people suffering from cardiovascular disease, so it is easy to sell ;&quot;>;(It turned out to be true. The initial printing of 10,000 copies sold out two months later, and more copies were printed immediately)&lt;/span>;. But during the typesetting period, I received the 15th edition of &quot;His&quot;, and the content also changed a lot! The number of authors has increased to 277, the length of the book has also expanded to about 5 million words, and even the layout style is very different. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is another severe test for me. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I can take a relatively easy path: according to the contract requirements, I will send out the completed translation manuscripts one after another and finish the book in three years. This is not considered backward internationally. But after all, I did not publish books for the sake of publishing books, but pursued it as a career. If I cannot dedicate the latest and best version to readers, even if this book comes out, I will leave deep regrets. After a fierce inner struggle at night, I got up at dawn and wrote a letter to Xu Cheng. As soon as the letter was sent, I couldn&#39;t help but go to the telecommunications office to make a long-distance call to him, explain the whole story, and ask him to immediately notify the printing factory to stop printing and recover the translation. I decided to start from scratch and re-translate the entire 15th edition of the book, and promised to hand over the first 500,000-word translation of Volume 5 within three months. The 10 volumes of the book will be released in about three years! &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Retranslation of the 15th edition&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;This is my fifth translation of &quot;Hebrew&quot;, and I strive to fully realize my early wish. I know the difficulty and workload of re-translating the entire book, but I think no matter how difficult it is, it will be much more convenient than translating the book in the labor camp. In order to save time, I never took any holidays from now on, and I also gave up the habit of taking a lunch break that I had developed over the years. I get up early every morning, stay up late and work at my desk. In February 1982, the first volume 5 was published as scheduled. At the end of December 1984, the translation of the 15th edition of &quot;His Internal Medicine&quot; was finally completed, totaling 4.7 million words. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/02/6f1b522794.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;1441&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/02/6f1b522794.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;260461&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Days and nights of re-translating the 15th edition of &quot;His Internal Medicine&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In June 1985, all ten volumes were published.

The Ministry of Health decided to establish a &quot;Special Award for Medical Translation&quot;. In February 1987, Minister Cui Yueli awarded me the award at the Ministry of Health. My wife Zeng Hanying was also invited to attend the award ceremony because of her hard work in the translation and publishing process. This award is the only one so far.

During the Republic of China, the Chinese Medical Association organized a group of domestic experts to collectively translate and publish the seventh edition of &quot;His&quot;, but it was limited to internal medicine-related content, not the entire book, so the title &quot;His Internal Medicine&quot; was used. The original book has extensive content, including various systems of clinical internal medicine, including surgery, obstetrics and gynecology, pediatrics, dermatology and venereal diseases, eyes, ears, nose and throat, as well as public health, medical statistics, clinical testing and radiological diagnosis, medical genetics and ethics, etc. Therefore, the original title of the book is &quot;&lt;em>;Cecil Textbook of Medicine&lt;/em>;&quot; &quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>;His Medical Textbook&quot;)&lt;/span>;.

Buyers are still coming in an endless stream. An old man rode a bicycle from the suburbs early to buy books. He is an engineer and there is no one in his family who is studying medicine. When I signed it for him, I reminded him that this was not a popular science book, but he still insisted on buying it. Later, when I was working on the supplementary translation of the 17th and 18th editions of &quot;His&quot;, my leader actually decided that the translation manuscript would be serialized in a comprehensive medical journal first, and the translation would be published as soon as possible.

This money was supposed to be used to prepare me for big things. But there are very few people who are as miserable as Zhu Dan and have no friends. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Recently, Zhu Dan revealed when participating in a program that he was defrauded of all his savings by a friend many years ago. She was deceived by her friend into being a debt guarantor and wrote her name on a blank piece of paper. As a result, she was forced to use all her savings to pay off all her friend&#39;s debts. Even if he won the lawsuit, the matter would end in Zhu Dan&#39;s misfortune because his shameless friend declared &quot;bankruptcy.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;How much this money is, many people are concerned about this issue. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Because the parties did not disclose specific figures, it is impossible to confirm. But this is not important, because we only need to know that this amount of money is beyond the imagination of ordinary people. The important thing is that this incident happened while Zhu Dan and Yiwei Yiwei were in love, but Yiwei Yi chose to repay the debt with Zhu Dan. In the program, when Zhu Dan recounted this unbearable event in a calm tone with red eyes under the wind chimes, Yiwei Yiwei looked at her with a distressed and forgiving look, as if he were facing a child who had been wronged. This scene It’s very emotional. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I believe that many people have met people who do things without thinking, otherwise there would be so many &quot;easy to deceive people&quot; in the world. How stupid is Zhu Dan&#39;s hasty behavior? As one netizen said, your behavior as a human being should not be too outrageous, and you must have a basic bottom line. Zhu Dan&#39;s best friend sent her a piece of white paper, and she dared to sign it. It was difficult for a middle school student to do this. Even the judge couldn&#39;t help &quot;teaching&quot; Zhu Dan that he was legally illiterate. As long as he signed on the white paper, It is equivalent to admitting everything on this piece of paper. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This netizen said that he does not have such a wife, but he has such a mother. These words also touched the sensitive parts of many people&#39;s hearts. I have relatives and friends who are like this. They don&#39;t listen to anything they say, and they only wake up after being deceived. However, it doesn&#39;t take long for them to fall into new routines again. As the saying goes, &quot;Dangdang is different&quot;, some people just can&#39;t get out of this tragic scam &quot;reincarnation&quot;. What can you do? Anyway, I heard that in addition to some parents &quot;paying the bill&quot; for their deceived children, there are many examples of couples breaking up. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So I very much agree with what this netizen said: Yiwei Yi helped her pay off the debt. This behavior cannot be described as high-spirited and upright. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In other words, Yiwei Yi seems to be indifferent to Zhu Dan, which is one of the reasons why some &quot;black fans&quot; have been criticizing Yiwei. Not only do they feel that Yiwei is not good to Zhu Dan, but they also habitually show off in public places. The &quot;poker-faced&quot; Zhou Yiwei got a lot of insults on his head. There are even rumors that the two are getting married. But now, many netizens woke up from the misunderstanding and discovered that Yiwei Yiwei is so good - &quot;I apologize for talking about Yiwei before. If he can avoid divorce after such a thing, I respect him as a real man.&quot; &quot;We endure hardships and enjoy happiness together.&quot; &quot;There are not many people who can repay debts together. And it&#39;s a man, even less.&quot; &quot;I thought he was quite shrewd, and it seemed like he was in love. I thought this kind of thing could only be done by parents to their children.&quot; &quot;Come out&quot; &quot;Yiwei Zhou is a relatively aloof but loyal type&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;You know, at that time Yiwei could have broken up with Zhu Dan without having to sacrifice himself. Even if the two are already married, Yiwei Yi has every reason to ignore the &quot;bad debt&quot;. After all, even according to the marriage law, it is not his responsibility. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhu Dan was tricked by his friends, which is a typical example of being defrauded. According to legal principles, whether you have an obligation to repay debts caused by being defrauded depends on whether the debts are used jointly by the husband and wife. Unless there is evidence to prove that the debt belongs to the couple&#39;s common living use, the other party has no obligation and responsibility to repay it. Obviously, the occurrence of Zhu Dan&#39;s debt had nothing to do with Zhou Wei, nor was it the result of a joint discussion between the two. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What’s ridiculous is that one netizen even commented that Zhou Yiwei actually used this matter to manipulate Zhu Dan and gain a useful slave. This is illogical. What can you do if you have tens of millions in your hand? What can you buy and eat? Do you have to give up half your life savings to someone else? Those who say this, and those who believe this, can also pay 10 million or 20 million for someone to treat you as a &quot;master&quot; and see if you are willing? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is really sad to see people without knowing their surroundings. We should feel lucky to still have such a kind and loving man like Yiwei Yi in our field of vision. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is precisely because of the old saying that &quot;husband and wife are originally birds of the same forest, and they fly separately when disaster strikes&quot;, acts of friendship are particularly noble. If a couple wants to maintain a long-term relationship, it is not enough to have an emotional foundation. In a difficult and changing world, if there is a lack of moral support and a little noble personality from both parties, it is not surprising that the couple breaks up halfway. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is the author&#39;s personal opinion only and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot; https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.run&quot; style= &quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.run&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 03 Dec 2023 14:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[阿童木会流泪吗？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261742]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-12-03 13:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 11/29/H4PoJ90PIQJmpKm7m3yKcQmBPcEXKYYenxj2YfGt.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;648&quot; height=&quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/H4PoJ90PIQJmpKm7m3yKcQmBPcEXKYYenxj2 YfGt. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;260022&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the recently launched animated series &quot;PLUTO&quot; by Netflix, the audience once again saw the familiar robot Astro Boy from their childhood. This animated work depicts the existential crisis of humans and robots after the Central Asian War. The information is dense, neat and compact, and its lightness is as impressive as its heaviness. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hideo Kojima, the game producer and a well-known science fiction fan and animation fan, said, &quot;This work is completely different from robot animations and hero animations that can only fight. This is Japanese manga (&lt;span style= &quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Comics&lt;/span>;), this is animation.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The birth of ChatGPT made mankind realize that it may be replaced in the new technological environment Species crisis, the Palestinian-Israeli conflict caused tragic casualties. In this reality, &quot;PLUTO&quot; appeared: the shadow of the post-war period shrouded the entire earth, and Persia, which had lost its country, created the giant robot Pluto and wanted to destroy him. Seven of the world&#39;s strongest robots, including Astro Boy. In the fictional story, &quot;war robot crisis&quot; replaces &quot;nuclear crisis&quot;, and &quot;robot sanctions&quot; replace &quot;nuclear sanctions&quot; in international politics. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1964, Japanese cartoonist Osamu Tezuka launched the special &quot;Astro Boy&quot; episode &quot;The Strongest Robot on Earth&quot;. From the 1950s to the 1970s when Japanese comics were on the rise, most cartoonists of Tezuka’s generation took a left-leaning political stance because of their experience in World War II. They were anti-war, respectful of life, and advocating equality in their works. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2003, with the permission of Osamu Tezuka&#39;s son, cartoonist Naoki Urasawa created &quot;PLUTO&quot; based on &quot;The Strongest Robot on Earth&quot;. &quot;PLUTO&quot;, born in 2023, is an animated series created by Netflix on this basis. From the anti-war thoughts in 1964, to the Iraq War in 2003, to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict in 2023, the three creations of &quot;PLUTO&quot; correspond to the war backgrounds of different eras. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Japan has long allowed the world to accept the artistic language of comics. Tokiwa-so cartoonists headed by Osamu Tezuka have redefined the depth and breadth of comics. Their depiction and exploration of emotions have made their works Crossing the boundaries of the audience. Although &quot;PLUTO&quot; takes place in the context of a grand robot war, its setting is still classical: How can a robot become more like a human? On the one hand, humans are afraid of being replaced by machines; on the other hand, they are full of discrimination against androids - humans have emotions, and robots are just inferior species. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Robot, are you really not sad? When robots cry, even they themselves are surprised. Who am I? Am I really grieving? Are these reactions emotions, or a set of codes? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;While watching this animation, I needed to press the pause button several times and stop for a while. Its perception and depiction of emotions are very innocent and beautiful, and sadness comes in an extremely light way. When Astro Boy is destroyed, will he be allowed to declare &quot;death&quot;? Or it can only be declared &quot;damaged and scrapped&quot;. Naoki Urasawa continues Tetsuka&#39;s exploration of &quot;the relationship between man and others&quot;, and still almost stubbornly depicts the possibility of &quot;understanding&quot; in a world full of fragmentation and disputes. For example, the robot North 2 went to the hometown of a stubborn artist to find the piano music in the artist&#39;s dream; the dinner between the robot Astro Boy and Dr. Pegasus; Ulan, who lost Astro Boy, could not face his own perception. The little robot keeps running around, trying to help sad humans. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I haven’t seen such an animated work for a long time. The last time it gave me such an emotional experience was the animated film &quot;Ghost in the Shell&quot;. Its English name is &quot;Ghost in the Shell&quot;. Those whispers in the machine body may be just ghosts that are difficult to define, but it happened after all, didn&#39;t it? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 03 Dec 2023 13:25:06 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[母亲起诉儿子返还购房款：对家庭是一个警示丨快评]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261756]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-12-03 11:50:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;According to CCTV&#39;s &quot;Today&#39;s Statement&quot; report, Yang&#39;s mother is a single mother, and her original condom was located in Dongcheng District, Beijing. The only house I have is my only son, Xiao Yang. She got 3.7 million from selling her house and transferred it to her son. She used it to buy a larger house in Tongzhou District, which she lived in and used as a wedding house for her son. Only her son&#39;s name was written on the property ownership certificate. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In June 2019, Xiao Yang got married, and Yang’s mother lived with Xiao Yang and his wife in the new house. Soon after the marriage, the daughter-in-law had conflicts with Yang&#39;s mother over daily trivial matters. The relationship between Xiao Yang, who firmly stands by his wife, and Yang&#39;s mother continues to deteriorate. After that, Xiao Yang and his wife moved out of their new house. Later, because his wife had another quarrel with Yang&#39;s mother, Xiao Yang became angry and blocked Yang&#39;s mother on WeChat. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2022, in order to solve the problem of her daughter’s schooling, Xiao Yang sent a WeChat message to her grandmother: “Sell the house in Tongzhou and let my mother use the money from her original sale to buy another house, and I will save money. Buy a house.&quot; &quot;If my mother can&#39;t agree, I will go to court to sue my mother in one month. If it really goes to court, there will be no turning back on our mother-son relationship.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Known After what her son said, Yang&#39;s mother said she was &quot;completely heartbroken&quot; and said she would be &quot;homeless&quot; if Xiao Yang sued her for obstruction. So Yang&#39;s mother sued Xiao Yang to return the purchase price of 3.7 million yuan for future pension purposes, and received the support of the court. This decision is in accordance with common law, or good customs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is a typical case of the conflict between the extended family orientation and the small family orientation. The current statutory legal framework talks about the individual standard and the small family standard: the division of property is based on the boundaries between individuals and small families, and small families implement the &quot;community property system&quot;; parents have raised their children to adulthood and have done their best to support them. Adult children have the obligation to support their parents. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Children who are minors must rely on their parents’ care, care and protection. Parents have custody and control over their children. When children become adults, they separate from their parents and form a nuclear family. If they get married and buy a house on their own, and do not receive support from their parents, nor do they expect to receive large amounts of property or inheritance from their parents, then the parents have not interfered with their children. A legitimate reason and effective starting point in life, children are &quot;independent&quot; from the extended family and gain the &quot;sovereignty&quot; of the small family. This is a normal intergenerational power transfer in a family. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, if on the one hand, the children get a large amount of support from their parents when they get married and buy a house, but on the other hand, they want to have a soft life and refuse their parents&#39; interference in their lives (whether it is &quot;suggestions&quot; or &quot;pointing fingers&quot;) Well, it’s actually the same thing), which essentially refuses parents to fulfill their “investor rights/powers”. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As far as this case is concerned, the quarrel between the daughter-in-law and Yang&#39;s mother over &quot;daily trivial matters&quot; may have started because the daughter-in-law couldn&#39;t stand her mother-in-law&#39;s lifestyle, or she couldn&#39;t accept her mother-in-law&#39;s interference in the couple&#39;s lifestyle. The specific quarrel may have different rights and wrongs, but the underlying reason must be: the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law are fighting for the right to speak or dominate the house or the family, or one party believes that the other party has usurped his rights to the things in the house or the family. power or dominance. This is the essence of many conflicts between mother-in-law and daughter-in-law. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are a lot of poisonous chicken soups on the Internet nowadays, such as &quot;A husband must stand for his daughter-in-law, otherwise he will be a mama&#39;s boy.&quot; This is probably because the daughter-in-law or the person who acts as the daughter-in-law by herself is online more, while the mother-in-law is less online, and the former has a higher voice. bigger. After Yang&#39;s mother paid 3.7 million yuan to provide a wedding house for the young couple, after the conflict between mother-in-law and daughter-in-law, the son did not reconcile the conflict, but blindly sided with the daughter-in-law, further intensifying the conflict, which shows that the son has nothing to do with his mother, who is an elder and investor. respect. There are many voices on the Internet who ridicule Xiao Yang for &quot;taking a wife and forgetting her mother.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After that, it was originally a tough and feasible plan to &quot;sell the house in Tongzhou and let my mother use the money from her original sale to buy another house while I save money to buy another house.&quot; But at the same time, Xiao Yang threatened his mother with &quot;prosecution&quot; and &quot;mother-child affection&quot;, which made her a little confused. During the court hearing, Yang&#39;s mother requested that the 3.7 million be recognized as a loan, while Xiao Yang requested that it be recognized as a gift from his mother, which seemed to contradict his promise. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The court ultimately determined that the money was a loan. But even if it is a gift, it is conditional and can be withdrawn. Mother Yang gave the money to her son to buy a house and only wrote his son&#39;s name on it. What she really meant was not &quot;I gave this money to you unconditionally. The house I bought will be written on your name.&quot; You can name it whatever you want.&quot; Instead, &quot;Mom, I have given all my belongings to prepare a wedding room for you. I will live with you. You have to take good care of me when I grow old. I only write your name because I hope you can compare my feelings with mine. Not only do they have the right to live, they should also be respected.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Xiao Yangs not only failed to manage intergenerational conflicts and despised the rights/rights of investors, but instead took the initiative to escalate conflicts and regarded their widowed mother as an enemy. Such a move is morally wrong, and it is unfair to weigh the interests and benefits. Sensible. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It’s okay to adhere to individual orientation + small family orientation, and at the same time insist on living independently and rejecting large-amount funding from parents; if you accept large-amount funding from parents, you must respect the rights/powers of the investor, and even You must have the awareness to be a low-key child. Of course, high-profile parents may not intervene, but in this case, not intervening is a sign of affection, not a duty. &quot;Having both&quot; doesn&#39;t work. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Furthermore, this case is also a warning to parents. By raising the children to adulthood, the parents&#39; duty has been completed and the legal responsibilities have been fulfilled. You cannot hand over your old capital to your children casually, and your main assets must be in your own hands. If a child needs a large amount of financial aid, it can be lent in a clear way, stipulating the principal, interest and repayment plan, or at least it should be clear that the parents have the right to claim it back. Don&#39;t let the children feel that their parents&#39; love for them is unconditional and they can take whatever they want. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Parent-child love must be two-way. It is sad that many parents become the tools of their children, providing money and effort, and then being picked on and stabbed by their young couples. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.run&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. run&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 03 Dec 2023 12:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[霞浦：摄影与旅游之间的距离]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261748]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-12-03 11:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 11/29/1TJD3qtqOhvQJaFThYraZxJdd9xdF8ml83fADU1S.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/1TJD3qtqOhvQJaFThYraZxJdd9xdF8ml83f ADU1S. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;259981&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Tourists take pictures of the sunrise at the seaside of Huazhu Village, Sansha Town, Xiapu County&lt;span style= &quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Xinhua News Agency/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Becoming a photography resort&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;When the sunset was about to dissipate, a group of foreign photographers returned At the B&amp;B on the mountain, we stood on the observation deck facing the coast and chatted. Looking down from the observation deck, there are still tourists taking pictures on the highway bridge at the foot of the mountain. Dongbi Village and Yugongting Village in Sansha Town, Xiapu County are famous for their sunset scenery. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;While waiting for the seafood banquet, a local member of the team introduced the owner of this B&amp;B to the photographers, Zheng Dexiong, the president of the Xiapu Photography Association, the person who famously photographed the Xiapu beach. His last introduction was: , &quot;The man who made Xiapu housing prices increase countless times.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Facts are more powerful than words. An abandoned rural self-built house in Sansha Town can be sold for more than 100,000 yuan a year. Rented to B&amp;B owners, if the property rights can be traded, the price of a house can be as high as several million. And B&amp;B owners just for a piece of land, they knocked down their houses and rebuilt them, decorating them carefully. The price for a sea view room per night in the off-season is four figures. The skyrocketing housing prices have become a difficult problem for Sansha people who moved away due to lack of local industries in the early years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After greetings, Zheng Dexiong sat back on the outdoor seat on the other side of the observation deck and was busy planning the shooting schedule for another upcoming photography group. There were two more shoots arranged by the local government the next day. meeting. Everyone who comes to Xiapu for research and inspection wants to meet Zheng Dexiong. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before Zheng Dexiong, no one focused on tidal flat photography, and almost no one realized that the beautiful scenery of Xiapu was rare enough to be displayed. Zheng Dexiong, who has been engaged in commercial photography since the 1990s, was convinced of the uniqueness of Xiapu scenery after seeing many photos of seaside scenery. In 2002, Zheng Dexiong began photographing the tidal flats in his hometown in his spare time. Two years later, at the suggestion of a friend, he held the first photography exhibition in Xiapu on the street of Longshou Road. He also submitted articles to many photography magazines. His works were repeatedly published and won awards. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Kasumigaura and its tidal flats are famous in the photography circle. Xiapu was rated as &quot;the first of China&#39;s top ten landscape photography holy places&quot;. Photography bases were built in small fishing villages along the coast. Fishermen who were engaged in seafood fishing returned to the shore, and young people who went out to work returned to their hometowns and started the tourism industry from scratch. . Zheng Dexiong remembers that 20 years ago, Xiapu County had only one short street and no foreign population. But now the city has expanded all the way to the seaside, and Taikang Road filled with food stalls is busy until late at night. In 2022, Xiapu, with a population of just over 500,000, received 7.2 million tourists. A few photos changed the fate of a county. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“It’s easy to say, but it’s not that simple. Over the past 20 years, we have actually invested a lot in transforming from private power to strong government support and from free services to a business model.” Zheng Dexiong objects to easy generalizations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When he first started photographing the tidal flats, Zheng Dexiong walked along the more than 400 kilometers of Xiapu coastline. It turned out that there were no roads on the shore and it was a barren mountain. He had to bring a machete and a hoe to open a road while walking. When shooting at Shajiang Pier, in order to find a shooting point with a suitable height, he climbed up from the bottom of the mountain. When he reached the top of the mountain, he discovered that there was a stone road built by the village on the other side. Several of Xiapu&#39;s early famous photography spots were discovered by Zheng Dexiong in this way. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zheng Dexiong paid for the early foreign photographers who came to Xiapu with his own money, until he could no longer afford the money. On May 1, 2007, he opened the first paid photography group. A one-week trip for 20 people cost more than 1,000 yuan per person. The local government saw the power of photography in the tourism industry and began to hold national photography competitions and create logos for photography spots. More importantly, the government has taken the lead in gradually building and improving supporting infrastructure for photography spots, including roads, parking lots, and observation decks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To this day, new photography spots are constantly being discovered. The 2017 edition of the &quot;Xiapu Photography Guide&quot; issued by the Xiapu Culture and Tourism Bureau lists 28 photography spots, and the number has increased to 33 in the 2021 edition. The infrastructure and tourism model around the photography spots have not yet been fully finalized, and both locals and tourists are adapting to the differences. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/xcAgdGZJ83aXw3hloXo7guXtXzsKDTWVPvIFJqAp.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;639&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/xcAgdGZJ83aXw3hloXo7guXtXzsKDTWVPvIFJqAp.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;259979&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Xiapu tidal flat scenery through Zheng Dexiong&#39;s lens&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(provided by interviewee/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>; Perfect Photo&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The first people to profit from photography are the characters closely related to the shooting. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zheng Dexiong believes that shooting in Xiapu is a test of skills and experience. &quot;The ebb and flow, changes in light and shadow, the alternation of four seasons, and different labor scenes in each season.&quot; This also means that shooting in Xiapu is uncertain. There are too many factors, including weather, tides, and seasons. The absence of any one element will lead to deviation from the default. Weather and tides can be grasped by experience, and labor scenes out of season can only be reproduced through performances. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the winter of 2005, a Taiwanese photographer came to Xiapu to take pictures, but the whole series was missing a picture of Xiaohao Village catching fish fry in spring. Considering that it was not easy to travel from Taiwan to the mainland, Zheng Dexiong asked local fishermen to cooperate in posing for photos. This is how the new profession of fishing model was born in Xiapu. To this day, even if no one buys fish fry anymore, the fishing models in Xiaohao Village still hold up a triangular fishing net frame every time they perform - this kind of special-shaped net is specially used to catch fish fry, and because of the award-winning photo shoot There are three fishing models, so the trio is also fixed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Three people make a good photo.” Every time they perform, Bao Xuexian, who is in her fifties, her aunt in her seventies, and her aunt’s brother-in-law will put on knee-length rubber shoes. Put on your straw hat, carry your fishing net and bamboo basket, and walk on the Xiaohao beach after low tide. The photographer would stand on the top of the mountain behind the village and shoot with a telephoto lens from a distance. Bao Xuexian&#39;s uncle Lin Jisong was responsible for reception on the mountain and conveyed the photographer&#39;s instructions to Bao Xuexian and others via radio. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The performance fee for a performance is 300 yuan, and the fishing model costs 100 yuan per person. More than half of the days a month, people will be invited to perform, but Bao Xuexian does not think that fishing models are an enviable job. &quot;Only those who can&#39;t make money become fishing models, and those who can make money go to cultivate oysters and grow seaweed.&quot; &quot;When there are no performances, Bao Xuexian and her aunt weave fishing nets and sell them for money. A two-layered large fishing net sells for 31 yuan, and a three-layered one sells for 42 yuan. They can weave up to two per day. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lin Jisong receives guests at the top of the mountain, but does not participate in the distribution of performance fees. He has other income. Most of the people in Xiaohao Village were originally fishermen. Lin Jisong did not know how to fish. 24 years ago, he built a temple on the top of the mountain and made a living by collecting incense money. When fishermen go to sea, life and death are determined by fate, and they will worship gods before leaving. After the Xiaohao Tidal Flat became famous, the government built an observation deck on the top of the mountain, right next to the temple built by Lin Jisong. He felt that the angle of the path on the cliffside was better, so he paved a stone road and placed a few plastic stools. Anyone who goes to take pictures on the stone road must &quot;donate&quot; 10 yuan for the film fee. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Famous photography spots have regular fishing models, such as Jiang Lianshui in Beiqi Tidal Flat and Lao Cheng in Yangjiaxi. They have taken award-winning photos together and know better than novice photographers about how to take photos. &quot;They all know the angle, focal length, aperture, and speed.&quot; Zheng Dexiong found it very interesting. &quot;Initially, we went to the village to select models. There were no special criteria. They just had to be fishermen.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the government building In front of the roads and observation decks, outsiders who come to take pictures of Xiapu have to find local photographers who know their way around. Photography directors came into being, referred to as photography directors. With supporting facilities in place, photography guides are still needed because outsiders can’t figure out the tide schedule and the best time to take photos at photography spots. Nowadays, the threshold for photography guides is much lower. Not only members of the local photography association, but also taxi drivers, travel agencies and villagers have joined in. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the early years, Zheng Dexiong also proposed to the Culture and Tourism Bureau to provide centralized training for people engaged in photography and photography to improve their service awareness and photography skills. Later, there were too many people and it was difficult to coordinate. When he was out shooting, Zheng Dexiong heard the cameraman introducing him to the tourists. They stood face to face and neither could recognize the other. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/GTBvngW7gqrVPIMUmksJuIhHm4SEcIpFR8OCw4jE.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/GTBvngW7gqrVPIMUmksJuIhHm4SEcIpFR8OCw4jE.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;259980&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Tourists vacation at a B&amp;B in Dongbi Village, Sansha Town, Xiapu County&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Xinhua News Agency/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p >; &lt;h4>;Advantage Judgment&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In the minds of photographers, different photography spots have different ratings. Zheng Dexiong believes that although Xiaohao Village has the most award-winning films, the scenery does not change much and is the same regardless of the season; Huazhu Village only has sunrise, and the location is best only in winter, which is relatively monotonous; Beiqi Village can be photographed in any season. However, the pole frames for planting seaweed have been moved from the coast to the edge of the inland sea, and the beauty of the tidal flat patterns and pole shadows can no longer be photographed. The coast of his hometown, Dakyo Village, is more suitable for tourism than photography, because there are only beaches in that area and no tidal flats, and tidal flats are the core of Kasumigaura photography. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What Zheng Dexiong likes most is the east wall. The scenery changes endlessly throughout the year. In 2019, Sansha Town invested 20 million to build a light and shadow plank road to connect the photography spots along the east wall, making this area more popular. When the tide goes out a few days after the first and fifteenth day of the lunar month, more people come to the road. I can&#39;t even stand on either side. The highway bridge where the Dongbi Photography Spot is located is on one side of Dongbi Village and on the other side is Yugongting Village. The two villages have become a gathering place for boutique B&amp;Bs. Zheng Dexiong and his students all stay here. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;No matter what the photographer thinks, the villagers have their own way of judging their own advantages. Uncle Zhang, the owner of Huazhu in the countryside of Huazhu Village, was originally doing business abroad. In 2020, he returned to the village to run a B&amp;B. He saw the potential of Huazhu. “Huazhu is a scenic spot for watching the sunrise. It is a must-go spot for anyone who comes to Xiapu. You must watch the sunrise. , you will most likely have to stay the night before.&quot; Uncle Zhang currently has 6 rooms, and the price per night is 400 to 600 yuan. According to his statistics, the occupancy rate is about 80%, and it is fully booked almost every day in the peak season. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another characteristic of Huazhu is that it is the Hokkien-speaking area of ​​this small town in eastern Fujian. Uncle Zhang talked about the history of Huazhu, starting from three hundred years ago, &quot;Our ancestors were Those who moved from southern Fujian didn’t have big boats before. Fishermen fished along the coast and came all the way along the coast. Maybe they came here to escape the wind and rain. Later, they saw the abundant seafood here and settled down.” Huazhu Village speaks Hokkien and lives in stone houses. , pronounced &quot;厝&quot; in Hokkien. When building the B&amp;B, the village committee required that the exterior appearance must retain the appearance of a house. Uncle Zhang plans to do a crowdfunding project to raise 8 million yuan to build 8 more B&amp;Bs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/UOC1TGi6Zn3AvbzELnYAgfV5g5HwSETROd1qh1iY.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/UOC1TGi6Zn3AvbzELnYAgfV5g5HwSETROd1qh1iY.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;259978&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Bao Xuexian’s aunt is in her seventies. When she is not performing, she makes money by weaving fishing nets&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern People Weekly reporter Nie Yang Xin/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the light and shadow plank road was built on the east wall, Niulangang Natural Village was gradually lost, but they were not willing to lag behind. Niulangang Village is the opening point of Xiapu’s first boutique B&amp;B CaoMuRen Teahouse. It has always regarded itself as the birthplace of Xiapu B&amp;B and is close to the county seat and the entrance to the highway. The introduction reads: “It is surrounded by mountains and sea, with beautiful scenery and convenient transportation. The location advantage is obvious and the tourism resources are unique.&quot; In the summer of 2023, Niulangang Village began construction to build an asphalt road and a viewing platform on the mountain where B&amp;Bs gather, hoping to regain the limelight as the first choice for tourists in the off-season. However, the construction team still started work during the Mid-Autumn Festival and National Day, which caused several negative reviews for surrounding B&amp;Bs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The sightseeing route from Gaoluo Beach, Dajing Beach to Hawei Island is named Donghai Route 1. Although there are few photographers, it is the route recommended by everyone in Xiapu. According to the observation of Xiaona, a stall owner on Xiawei Island, the sea caves on Xiawei Island are the internet celebrity photo spots that occupy the high traffic volume of social platforms. Since being photographed by an Internet celebrity at the end of 2021, it has attracted countless tourists. &quot;On May Day, one kilometer of road can be blocked for several hours.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xiao Na and the young people in the stall area They originally worked in the county or around Ningde City. After their hometown became a tourist attraction in the past two years, they came back to set up stalls. &quot;No matter how much or how little you earn, at least you have more freedom.&quot; Xiaona&#39;s husband also came back to work as a photo guide, using his home An idle small off-road vehicle will charge 150 yuan to pick up passengers from Xiawei Island to another nearby scenic spot, the lighthouse; if it is a chartered vehicle, the price per day is 600 yuan, and you can choose Donghai Line 1 or Sansha Dongbi Line. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It only takes two days to visit all the popular photography spots in Kasumigaura, and most tour groups’ itineraries are customized within two or three days. Xiaona has heard from many tourists that a three-day and two-night tour that includes transportation, food, and accommodation only costs more than a thousand yuan. “But the tour group doesn’t care about the weather and tides, and skips some spots if you can’t see them. ”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/ttxFP6MudBOg1At6KJCYvZuBEW5ytgpsqAZwwxwM.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height =&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/ttxFP6MudBOg1At6KJCYvZuBEW5ytgpsqAZwwxwM.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;259977&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot; color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In the planning of Huazhu Village, the appearance of the B&amp;B should retain the unique stone house style of southern Fujian&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern People Weekly reporter Nie Yang Xin/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Uneven&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The most common thing Ou Shao of Beiqi Village hears from tourists is, &quot;Why is it different here from the photos?&quot; &quot;So when he sees tourists now, he will explain in advance, &quot;Be sure to pay attention to the weather when visiting Xiapu. The weather is good or bad, and taking photos is completely different.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Zheng Dexiong&#39;s view, photography spots and tourist spots themselves It’s just different. “Some tourists come to the photography spot and feel that there is nothing to see, because photography has requirements on time and light.” The aesthetic perspectives of photographers and tourists are also different. The photographer was on the highway bridge on the east wall. There are three types of landscapes you can take pictures of - the grand landscape of the sunset, the seaweed net on the lake and the lines of the tidal flats under the bridge, but tourists generally only look at the sunset. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ye Yu, who sells coffee under the observation deck of Huazhu Village, remembers that no one in the village cared about the sunrise before. When fishermen go out to catch fish, they go out at high tide and return at high tide. They look at the tide table, which has nothing to do with sunrise and sunset. On New Year&#39;s Day in 2013, CCTV broadcast the sunrise live in Huazhu, which earned Huazhu the title of &quot;China&#39;s Sun Viewing Landmark.&quot; The sunrise footage captured by CCTV was posted on the wall under the observation deck, and a stone tablet was erected next to it: &quot; How blessed to be in the same time and space as this sunrise.&quot; Ye Yu remembered that the CCTV sunrise was filmed by the staff who set up tents on the top of the mountain and lived there for a month. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Beiqi Village was probably the first place to realize the different needs of tourism and photography. The Ou Shao family opened a B&amp;B in the village in 2013, and began taking tourists out to sea for sightseeing and fishing entertainment in 2020. So far, it has developed nearly ten projects, including tourist charters, fishing outings, parent-child trips to the sea, sales of dried seafood, and cage nets. &quot;The passenger flow here is unstable, so we can only develop more.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ou Shao&#39;s family used to be fishermen, and their income from fishing was unstable. &quot;There are not so many fish now, and every May The fishing season is closed from the 1st to August 31st, and large boats can park on the shore.&quot; They considered daily fishing and tourism during the fishing ban period, and found that it was not cost-effective to do it for only three months. &quot;Do it all year round. If you do this, you will accumulate many old customers.&quot; So they concentrated on the tourism industry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ou Shao’s father now goes out to sea to fish, always accompanying guests on a chartered boat. The price of chartering a boat is 600 yuan, and the catch is uncertain. “It’s okay to catch more or less. Some tourists are Those who have come from the inland have never seen the sea and find it very fresh.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;More tourists choose to spend 30 yuan to take a 20-minute boat ride to see the seaweed that has been planted on the edge of the inland sea. The Ou Shao family built a new boat in May 2023, costing 50,000 to 60,000 yuan. The cabin area was specially enlarged to accommodate up to 30 people. There are several families involved in the boat tour project in the village, including Ou Shao&#39;s relatives. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When Ou Shao was soliciting tourists at the beach, an electric bicycle rode on the village road and he also talked to the tourists on the roadside. I asked Ou Shao, &quot;Is that your relative or a competitor?&quot; Ou Shao replied: &quot;It&#39;s my relative and a competitor.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The two of them stood guard in front of the entrance of the seaside parking lot, taking turns. Go up and ask the private car coming in. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/nRn68R4EnzQITldKMsR5Tb86hebJFP3gNZzks7Wm.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/nRn68R4EnzQITldKMsR5Tb86hebJFP3gNZzks7Wm.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;259982&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Uncle Zhang is making fire hoses for a B&amp;B by hand. He believes that returning to his hometown to build a B&amp;B is a feeling for his hometown&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern Characters Weekly reporter Nie Yangxin/photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Under construction&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Not all famous photography spots can catch up with the tourism boom. Xiaohao Beach is the earliest famous, but the surrounding areas The supporting facilities and B&amp;B design are lagging behind those of Dongbi and Huazhu on the same line. The B&amp;Bs in Xiaohao Village are concentrated in the new area on the edge of the old village. A large open space from the new area to the seaside is filled with sand, gravel, soil, fishing nets, construction waste and domestic garbage. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The B&amp;Bs in Xiaohao Village are mainly self-built houses in rural areas. Villagers rent and sell spare rooms in their own houses. The decoration style of the rooms is basically the bedrooms of ordinary commercial houses. In order to reduce the difficulty of cleaning, a pile of public slippers are placed at the door of each B&amp;B for guests to change into. Such a room costs 300 yuan a night. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Muhai B&amp;B is one of the few boutique B&amp;Bs currently in operation. It has floor-to-ceiling glass windows facing the sea and a small outdoor garden. The proprietress Wu Sister-in-law said that the design fee for the B&amp;B cost 60,000 yuan. . Sister-in-law Wu’s husband is a village cadre. When the houses in the new district first started to be decorated in 2018, he suggested that the villagers decorate them in the style of a B&amp;B, but the villagers were unwilling. Sister-in-law Wu said, “Someone asked at that time, and I bought it after all the hard work. If you decorate a house yourself and enjoy it, why should you let others live in it? By the time they want to think about a B&amp;B again, it will be too late.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sister-in-law Wu&#39;s B&amp;B will open in 2021, and only 5 of the two floors have been repaired. In the peak season, the price of a suite and bathtub room is as high as thousands of yuan per night, but in the off-season, there are almost no guests. She believes that the supporting facilities around Xiaohao Village have affected the development of B&amp;Bs. “There used to be a parking lot that could park 70 cars, and the roads were beautifully built, but it was demolished in 2021 and has not been built yet.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since 2021, Xiaohao Village has been caught in a storm of accountability for illegal land occupation and illegal construction in rural areas. After investigation and verification by relevant departments, Xiaohao Village actually built 121 homesteads, of which 61 were built by non-village personnel. It also introduced commercial health care projects and occupied 16 homesteads. In March 2022, information released by relevant higher-level departments stated that &quot;all illegally sold collective land has been taken back to the village collective, and the land will be restored to its original state after demolition.&quot; The villagers also don&#39;t know what will happen to this empty land filled with waste. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Natural conditions also restrict the development of some photography spots. Although the Xiawei Island Sea Cave is popular, it can only be revealed after low tide. Tourists who want to take pictures have to climb down the seaside rocks with bare hands. A warm reminder in the &quot;Xiapu Photography Guide&quot;, &quot;The reefs on the shore are easily slippery due to corrosion by sea water. It is recommended to wear non-slip shoes and walk slowly. Elderly people with limited mobility should not go there.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sea caves are equipped with The rescue workers said, &quot;Every day, tourists slip off the rocks and fall into the sea.&quot; The scenic spot originally wanted to build a wooden boardwalk, but the rocks were severely corroded and broke when nails were hammered in, so they had to give up. &quot;Do you know why the scenic spot doesn&#39;t charge admission tickets? If it does, the compensation (if something happens) will be up to the sky.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is nearly 50 kilometers from the county seat to Xiamei Island, and there is a long stretch of road in the middle. It is a gentle mountain road. In recent years, a new road has been built close to the coastline. This road is open even before it is included in the map navigation. Just like the tourism industry here, it seems that it has not yet been completed, but the reception of tourists has already begun. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 03 Dec 2023 11:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[我和物业博弈的这一年：解决问题有多难？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261740]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-12-03 10:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;The fate that every new owner cannot escape is to deal with and confront the property. This is his homework and his of practice. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since I took over the house and became an owner in October last year, I have started to form a front with my neighbors and compete with the property management. Today, the team has collapsed, losing ground, and the rights protection has ended in failure. It&#39;s the same as the mental process of decorating, from being full of emotions to being discouraged, and finally giving up. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When the house was handed over for inspection, the quality of the house was worrying and many areas needed repairs. However, the developer did not do anything and delayed to solve most of the problems. Until now, the paint surface of the corner of my second bedroom is cracked. The seam is still there intact. This is indeed the developer&#39;s problem. The property management company can only help me communicate my needs, but they belong to the same company, and the property management company has collected property fees early. I have to discuss an explanation with the property management company. It is not unfair at all to take the blame. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the process of fighting with the property owners, each other&#39;s tactics also changed according to the other&#39;s actions, and they continued to see each other&#39;s progress and retreat. If the housekeeper responds politely and politely, I will also communicate politely. If I am tougher, she will get angry at me. More often than not, the housekeeper will use low-grade deception, but I can&#39;t expose her directly. I have to leave a little kindness so that we can meet each other in the future and everything can be discussed. She told lies and fully accepted my needs, saying that she would urge and reflect them, but my problems would not be advanced or solved. She treats me as a fool. If she can evade something, she will do it first. Later problems will be dealt with later. The rhetoric will always be dealt with in a unified manner later. In the end, he couldn&#39;t do anything perfunctorily and ran out of patience. The housekeeper simply stopped making excuses and played the emotional card. She admitted that the developers were rogue and the property management companies were rogue. She only received a salary of a few dollars a month, so how could she have the final say? Without pretending, I was moved by her words that were completely embarrassing, and I began to accept in my heart that this was the end. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before I paid the property fee, I had to ask the housekeeper to get the key when I opened the door of my house. The owner of the owner group once privately suggested that I replace the lock cylinder and argue with the property management company about when to solve the problem and when to pay. . I didn&#39;t want to take an extreme approach, and I was eager to get a property certificate to install charging piles, so I had no choice but to surrender. Once the money is handed over, it becomes even more difficult to ask them to do something. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Based on this year’s negotiations and observations, I found that one of the main job responsibilities of the property management company is to collect fees. As early as September, before the previous year&#39;s property fees were due, the housekeeper started a show of fancy reminders to pay the next year&#39;s property fees. Taking advantage of the fact that the owners were at home at night, the housekeepers divided their forces and went door to door to collect property fees. Everyone among the owners condemned this behavior of only enjoying rights without assuming obligations. A few days later, the property management company sent out a notice with bait, offering free rice and cooking oil if the property management fee was paid during this period. So, I often see the housekeeper walking in the community carrying grain and oil, and watching her retreating back, I wonder, if the execution of solving problems is so touching, why are we here? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After a year of fighting, my interest in fighting for the rights of my neighbors has slowly cooled down. Recently, there have been voices in the group that want to replace the property, but I no longer have such high expectations for the final result. Confrontation between property owners and property owners has become the norm. I am afraid that my property and I, as well as the domestic property management industry, still have a long, long way to go. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(The author is an employee of a state-owned enterprise in Hangzhou, Zhejiang)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot; color: #ba1010;&quot;>;• &lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;(The &quot;Hi, Southern Weekly&quot; column of Southern Weekend App is looking forward to you Submission email: nfzmreaders@163.com)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 03 Dec 2023 10:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[香港仔：太平山B面]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261712]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-12-03 09:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Take the green-painted Star Ferry from Tsim Sha Tsui. Rows of high-rise buildings slowly approach and zoom in. Behind them The Taiping Mountains are spread out like a belt, rising and falling gently in the porthole. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The original name of Taiping Mountain is Hard Head Mountain, also known as Xianglu Peak. It was renamed because after the surrender of the great thief Zhang Baozai during the Jiaqing period of the Qing Dynasty, the residents of Hong Kong Island thought that there would be peace. In a broad sense, Taipingshan is composed of Mount Chechi, Lufeng Gorge, Gough Hill, Kwun Lung Kok and Mount Keli; in a narrow sense, it refers to Mount Chechi, the highest peak on Hong Kong Island with an altitude of 554 meters. There are two theories about what flag-pulling is: one is that Cheung Po Tsai raised the flag as a signal when he was a thief and commanded the people at the bottom of the mountain to rob merchant ships; the other is that in 1841, the British army occupied Hong Kong Island and raised the Union Jack flag here. Austin, who served as Colonial Secretary of Hong Kong from 1868 to 1878, named the mountain Mount Austin, and later renamed it Victoria Peak after the Queen of England (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 毷体, 毷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot; >;Victoria Peak&lt;/span>;) and is still used today. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After living in Shenzhen for more than 20 years, I have traveled to Hong Kong many times and visited Victoria Peak. To be precise, it is the crowded places on the north bank of Victoria Peak such as Central, Admiralty, Causeway Bay, and The Peak. Among Hong Kong people, the Peak refers specifically to Victoria Peak, and there is no ambiguity. However, most tourists today mistake the cable car terminal and Lingxiao Pavilion area for the top of the mountain. In fact, it is called Lufeng Gorge. Even for me, it was a few months ago that I walked through the slightly deserted Austin Mountain Road and climbed to the top of the real mountain for the first time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Standing on the observation deck on the top of the mountain, leaning on the railing and overlooking the sky, the north bank is surrounded by red dust and glitz; on the south bank, countless low hills seem to be eager to embrace the South China Sea... If the noise and commotion were the Taiping Mountains The A side of Taiping Mountain, then, silence and tranquility are the B side of Taiping Mountain. A green mountain magically captures a completely different contrast. Unfortunately, due to other arrangements, I had no time to get close to Nan&#39;an Fangze that day. This time, Aberdeen, Hong Kong, where I made a special trip, is located in the center of Side B of Victoria Peak. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;Photography of Pang Mian looking at Aberdeen Deep Bay, Hong Kong&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/02/c1ca8b8bac.jpg &quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;810&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/02/c1ca8b8bac.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot; 260440&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999;&quot;>;Overlooking Aberdeen Deep Bay, Hong Kong&amp;nbsp;Photography by Pang Mian&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Looking for Hong Kong Village&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4 >; &lt;p>;At Admiralty, transfer to the MTR South Island Line. One stop will bring you to the famous Ocean Park in Hong Kong, and then take a short shuttle bus to the Fullerton Ocean Park Hotel you booked. Speaking of which, I am no stranger to Fullerton. Many years ago, I stayed at the Fullerton Hotel in Singapore on a business trip. It was a neoclassical building completed in 1928. It is as legendary as the Peace Hotel in Shanghai. I still remember that the passage on the ground floor leads directly to the Merlion, the landmark of the Lion City. The Fullerton Ocean Park Hotel where I stayed this time is located in the geometric center of the south bank of Victoria Peak. When the bus turned around and got rid of the noisy city, the transparent windows were suddenly filled with green mountains and blue and white sea. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;Aberdeen location map courtesy Pang Mian&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/02/cd1f944deb.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;734&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/02/cd1f944deb.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;260441 &quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999;&quot;>;Aberdeen location map&amp;nbsp;Photo provided by Pang Mian&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The hotel faces the sea, on the left hand side, dozens of steps away, is 2021 The Ocean Park Water Park, Asia&#39;s first all-weather seaside water park, opened in 2016, has layers of recreational facilities that spread over the entire hillside like terraces. On the right, two breakwaters piled with rocks are as gray as scratches, collecting the treasures of the rich. &quot;Toys&quot; - yachts and sailing boats; and directly ahead, Ap Lei Chau, which looks like a duck swimming in water, has half its head and body buried in the sea, vividly dividing the sea area connecting Victoria Harbor and the South China Sea into There are two waterways, wide and narrow: within Ap Lei Chau, the narrower one is called Aberdeen Strait, which is used by small boats; outside, the wider one is called East Lamma Strait, which is used by large ships. Stop for a moment, and before your eyes, you can see the endless busyness of various ocean-going ships and the slow and leisurely pace of various yachts and sailing boats. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;View of Ap Lei Chau from The Fullerton Ocean Park Hotel.

Like Hong Kong citizens, hiking in Aberdeen Country Park is one of my bucket list for this trip. Unexpectedly, after walking a few steps along Nanfeng Road, I encountered a small black and white road sign with an arrow pointing north to &quot;Wong Chuk Hang Stone Carvings 250m Meters&quot;. Soon, on the north side of the Jockey Club Science Building, behind a stack of easily overlooked cement steps and next to a rushing stream, I saw the Wong Chuk Hang rock carvings. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is a relic dating back about 3,500 years. A yellow mountain cliff stands on the right bank of the creek. Although it has been weathered and eroded, three groups of slightly blurred swirling patterns on the six or seven square meters of rock surface still look like the eyes of an animal staring at me as I &quot;break in&quot;. This reminds me of the similar Shang and Zhou bronzes &lt;span>;Taotie pattern&lt;/span>;. Taotie is a vicious and greedy monster in ancient Chinese mythology. &quot;Zuo Zhuan&quot; believes: &quot;Greed for money is gluttony, gluttony is gluttony.&quot; In modern times, with the rise of peace, its meaning has become a description of a foodie who is fond of delicious food. As for the Taotie pattern, it first appeared on the pottery and jade of the Liangzhu Culture in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River. Because the patterns often have heads but no bodies, they are also called &quot;animal face patterns.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Perusing the on-site cultural relics plaque, I learned that there are nine ancient stone carvings in Hong Kong. Only two existing ones on the south coast of Hong Kong Island are Tai Long Bay and Wong Chuk Hang. Among them, the Tai Long Wan Stone Carvings were the first to be listed as a statutory monument (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;1978&lt;/span>;), while the Wong Chuk Hang Stone Carvings are the only ones located inland. , stone carvings far away from the coast. So, why is the stone at this moment? According to my judgment, if the stream under my feet has flowed forever, this is probably the place where ancestors worshiped water sources and drew fresh water. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Where there is fresh water, there must be villages. When I turned back along the original road, I noticed that the stream took advantage of the grass and rocks to penetrate into the underground culvert of Nanfeng Road and disappeared without a trace. Fortunately, there is a blue sign reading &quot;Old Walled Village&quot; erected at the opposite intersection, eye-catchingly pointing to the Nanfeng Trail branching off from Nanfeng Road. &quot;Wei&quot; is a common name for villages in Lingnan in the past. It not only means &quot;gathering people here&quot;, but also has an &quot;image summary&quot; of the walls and houses built in the village. Jiuwei and Laowei are equivalent to the old villages and old villages in the north, and refer to the villages with the longest history in the area. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The full name of Jiu Wai Village is Wong Chuk Hang Jiu Wai, because of the ravine with flowing water in the former village (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>; span>;) is named after the broom-shaped yellow bamboos that grow all over the place. However, according to Ye Lingfeng&#39;s book &quot;Hong Kong Stories&quot;, Jiuwei Village was first called Hong Kong Village or Hong Kong Wai. It is recorded in ancient books such as &quot;Yue Da Ji·Guangdong Coastal Map&quot; by Wanli in the Ming Dynasty and &quot;Xin&#39;an County Chronicle&quot; by Kangxi in the Qing Dynasty. At that time, the production and sales of Wanxiang (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 毷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;referring to the agarwood produced in Dongguan, Shenzhen, Hong Kong and other areas today) were booming, and this area became prosperous. As the initial distribution center. As late as 1866, the &quot;Comprehensive Map of Xin&#39;an County&quot; printed in Leipzig, Germany still marked the name of the village &quot;Hong Kong Wai&quot;. The name of Hong Kong today &quot;was gradually popularized based on the name of this small village.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The south wind path is not long, and the old walled village is huddled on the steep slope at the end. The lower slope is filled with vehicles; the upper slope is incredibly covered with squatter houses made of iron sheets. Entering the village and walking around, except for a small Buddhist hall and a small mountain shrine that were dimly lit by incense, I didn&#39;t find any ancient meaning. I asked the grandmother who tended the vegetable garden and learned that many years ago, the Aberdeen Tunnel Toll Station and Wong Chuk Hang Hospital were built, and the old houses were demolished. While I was talking, suddenly, four or five big yellow dogs came close to me and barked at me. When I was young, my experience in fighting dogs in the countryside came in handy. I forced myself to stay calm and made steady progress. At this time, I saw a bamboo pavilion and a nest of slender bamboos at the entrance of the village, which perfectly echoed the name of the village in Wong Chuk Hang. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;The swimming pool of the Fullerton Ocean Park Hotel faces the East Lamma Strait.

As you walk higher and farther, your body and mind rise and fall with the mountains, as if you are immersed in the fragrance of the forest and the occasional singing of birds. Aberdeen Country Park is one of the first country parks in Hong Kong. It was established in 1977 and covers an area of ​​about 423 hectares. It encompasses the Nip Ko Sun, Cameron Highlands, Ban Na and Tin Wan mountains from east to west. The hiking trails in between are connected with those elsewhere, and can reach the entire Hong Kong Island. At the end of the 19th century, the old houses in Jiuwei Village were still there, and the surrounding fields and grassy fields attracted visitors from Victoria City (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 毷体, 毷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;today’s Central and Sheung Wan, Hong Kong High-ranking officials, wealthy businessmen, gentlemen and ladies from the area (&lt;/span>;) came in droves to spend time. The more people walking, the more roads there are in the mountains. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Climbing to the mountainside, a water diversion channel (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Aqueduct&lt;/span>;), which is more than 1 meter wide and deep, is clearly visible. Eyes, U-shaped bottom trickling gurgling. As we all know, Hong Kong’s fresh water is poor, especially on Hong Kong Island. In order to alleviate the tension, in the 1960s, Guangdong Province successively built the Shenzhen Reservoir and the Dongjiang-Shenzhen Water Supply Project to provide support. The Hong Kong government excavated diversion channels and other facilities in the mountains to collect spring water and rainwater, and then directed them into reservoirs (&lt;span style =&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;That is, the reservoir&lt;/span>;). Today, aqueducts and reservoirs have become &quot;standard features&quot; in almost all country parks in Hong Kong. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/02/3ead0c739e.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;810&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/02/3ead0c739e.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;260444&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p >;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Madam King&#39;s Horse Racing Trail offers a bird&#39;s eye view of the center of Aberdeen. &amp;nbsp; Photography by Pang Mian&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When the water diversion channel turned around and rushed down the pit, at the feet, the road surface of Mrs. Jin’s Horse Racing Trail changed from gravel to loess. Mrs. King&#39;s Horse Racing Trail, also known as Mrs. Gold&#39;s Trail, is named after the wife of the 17th Hong Kong Governor Clementi Clementi. It is about 5 kilometers in length, and some sections overlap with the famous Hong Kong Island Trail. Mrs. King&#39;s name was Mary Ayers. She was born in 1889 and later moved to Hong Kong with her father, Admiral C.J. Ayers. In 1912, she married Clementi, who was 14 years older than her. The two were deeply in love as a couple and loved traveling and Chinese culture. Clementi was even promoted to Governor of Hong Kong in 1925 because of this. During his tenure, Clementi worked hard to eliminate the negative impact of the general strike in the province and Hong Kong on Hong Kong, improve relations with the mainland, and promote Chinese education. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Under his initiative, the University of Hong Kong established a Chinese Department in 1927 and invited a group of former Qing Dynasty Hanlin scholars to teach old classics. Unexpectedly, this move aroused verbal and written criticism from figures in the New Culture Movement such as Lu Xun and Hu Shi. What is right and what is wrong has changed with time. However, it is also an indisputable fact that the Department of Chinese Language and Literature of the University of Hong Kong set off a trend of attaching importance to Chinese education, and later emerged famous literary figures such as Zhang Ailing, Huang Zhan, and Lin Xi. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to official duties, Clementi often accompanied his wife on horseback riding outings here to appreciate the mountains and seas of Aberdeen. Writer Liu Kexiang pointed out in &quot;Three Quarters of Hong Kong&quot; that in winter, there are six to seven hundred &quot;mountain eagles&quot; in the Aberdeen Country Park area. &lt;/span>;) favored urban green fields&quot;. Maybe I came a little early in the season and only saw a few flying birds. But the Clementi couple should have seen the scene of the eagle circling and covering the sky. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;Hiking in Nanlang Mountain, photo provided by Pang Mian&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/02/27c1665f22.jpg &quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;719&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/02/27c1665f22.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot; 260445&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999;&quot;>;Hiking in Nanlang Mountain&amp;nbsp;Photo provided by Pang Mian&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Dan Family and Seafood Fang&lt;/strong>;&lt; /h4>; &lt;p>;At this moment, at 4 o&#39;clock in the afternoon, I arrived at the Buchang Bay Pier and was immediately surrounded by ships on the sea and shipyards on the shore.

On board and sitting, I found that the bundle was covered with jewelry: red lanterns, artificial flowers and plants, and small &quot;nation&#39;s flags&quot; in Hong Kong&#39;s place names. As soon as the boat opened, it followed slightly. Zhu Grando, who was driving the boat, said deliberately: &quot;This is the most beautiful in Hong Kong&#39;s water. The most beautiful &lt;/span>; in Hong Kong&#39;s water &lt;/span>;). &quot;The boat pocked a beautiful arc, the motor was low, and the direction of the coming was. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Water people call &lt;span>; as &lt;/span>; in the Mainland, mainly distributed in the southeast coast. Historically, the name of the family is mixed, such as yachts, Baishuilang, eggs, 蜑, snakes, boat households, etc. Until the Tang and Song dynasties, it was collectively referred to as &quot;疍&quot;. The Tang Dynasty Liu Zongyuan&#39;s &quot;Lingnan John John Temple&quot; was the earliest &quot;疍&quot; literature. Regarding the origin of the origin of the family, scholar Chen Xujing has done statistics, as many as 30 species. Among them, the most romantic: one is from the people, the mermaid; the other is the descendants of Fan Ye and Xi Shi in the Spring and Autumn Period. The generally accepted opinion believes that the family is the descendants of Baiyue, who was killed in the southeast of the Qinhuang and Han Wu. The &quot;Answers of the Ridge&quot; that the Southern Song Dynasty went to the &quot;Mountains&quot; said: &quot;Take the boat as the room, the water as the land, and the floating life rivers and the sea, and the&quot; also &quot;; From an early age, he taught him to step on waves. Boil crabs as grains, and bananas do not need gauze for cloth. &quot;Since the 1950s, the Mainland’ s family members have been settled ashore. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; However, Grandma Zhu did not agree with the view of the book. She told me that in the past, the people on the water were small and could not raise pig cows, so they had to raise chickens, ducks and geese. For a long time when people on the shore came to buy eggs. After a long time, it was called the waterman &quot;&lt;span style =&quot; font-family: regular body, regular body_gb2312, stkaiti; &quot;>; Tongyu &lt;/span>;). &quot;If my mother is alive, when I hear the egg family, I will be scolded, so taboo.&quot; &lt;/P>; &lt;p>; &lt;img alt = &quot;Zhu Grandma Zhu who has been driving for a lifetime, Pang Mian&quot; src = &quot;http: // images .infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/02/d9bf2e440b.jpg &quot;border =&quot; 0 &quot;width =&quot; 1080 &quot;height =&quot; 1439 &quot;data-src =&quot; // Images.infzm.com/cms/cms/cms/cms /-Medias/image/23/12/02/d9bf2e440b.jpg &quot;data- key =&quot; 260447 &quot;>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style =&quot; color: #999999; &quot;>; Zhu Awo &amp; nbsp; Monster &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In 1841, the British first came to let a family member Chen Qun bring the road. After passing the village of Hong Kong, when he asked the place name, Chen Qun, who asked the family, answered &quot;Kanggang&quot;, and the British army remembered it with &quot;hongkong&quot;. Of course, this is just a legend. As far as I know, in 1793, when the Macau Milk Mission in the United Kingdom left China, the relevant reports have mentioned &quot;hongkong&quot;: &quot;&lt;span style =&quot; font-family: regular body, regular body_GB2312, stkaiti; &quot;>; Today belongs to Shenzhen &lt;/span>;) and Hong Kong is suitable for colonial.&quot; But in any case, this legend also reflects the relationship between Hong Kong and the family. As for the origin of Hong Kong, it is also a bit related to this legend: After Hong Kong became the name of the entire island, in order to avoid confusion, the people renamed it as &quot;Hong Kong Zai&quot;, that is, &quot;Little Hong Kong&quot;. Later, the Hong Kong British government changed Hong Kong&#39;s English name &quot;Littlehongkong&quot; to Aberdeen (&lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_gb2312, stkaiti;&quot;>; Yabutian &lt;/span>;) The four generations of Earl Yabudian and the British Foreign Minister George Hamilton-Gordon. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The boat entered the deep bay, revealing a piece of empty water, and the huge neon light cards desertedly wrote &quot;Welcome&quot;. Far away, there is a bleak painting — Taibai seafood, like the old lady who is old to miss youth. &quot;The original position of the treasure seafood&quot;, Grandma Zhu said that the guests turned their heads. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Around 1930, Guangzhou&#39;s family brought the &quot;singing hall&quot; into Hong Kong Zai. This kind of water restaurant that integrates and tourism is integrated, coupled with local famous seafood, quickly became popular. Cultural celebrities who went south to visit Hong Kong, such as Hu Shi and Cai Yuanpei, also smelled the fragrance and the friends, and came here. After entering the 1950s, there were more than ten upgraded seafood crickets in the &quot;Church&quot;. In 1971, the treasure seafood was fired during the decoration, which was severely damaged. The Macau Gambler He Hongzhang heard the news that the Xunjia genes in the bones wake up (&lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_gb2312, stkaiti;&quot;>; The great-grandmother is the family &lt;/span>;), partnership with others, throwing a person, throwing a person, throwing it More than 30 million Hong Kong dollars bought rebuilds. In 1976, the design of the palace style of the Ming Dynasty and the treasure seafood of more than 2,300 people opened. A few years later, He Hongzhang included the biggest competitors&#39; Taibai Seafood and Haijiao Palace. The world&#39;s largest sea food house, the treasure kingdom, was born in the air, and it was like the green landmark of Hong Kong. At that time, the dignitaries visited Hong Kong, and they couldn&#39;t come here to &quot;check in.&quot; The young man Zhu, Zhu, rely on the free boat (&lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_gb2312, stkaiti;&quot;>; ferry &lt;/span>;), with a monthly income of more than 10,000. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; It is interesting that the golden age of &quot;treasure kingdom&quot; is also a period of prosperity and prosperity in Hong Kong films. From Bruce Lee to Jackie Chan, from &quot;Dragon Fighting Tiger&quot; to &quot;Infernal Affairs 2&quot;, it has become a resort for Hong Kong films to compete. Especially in &quot;God of Food&quot;, Zhou Xingchi has a floating clothes, walking around the waves, and flying to the bridge of the window, leaving deep memories for the star fans. Including a word, the real shooting point of &quot;God of Food&quot; is in Taibai Seafood. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In 1998, the Asian financial turmoil created the &quot;Treasure Kingdom&quot;. The Haijiao Palace stopped business first, and then moved to Qingdao. In the future, the &quot;treasure kingdom&quot; is getting worse.

When Hong Kong was also called Shiquan Bay, the family had been engaged in short -distance fishery and water transportation, and participated in the transfer of stone and Guanxiang. But what I saw in front of me was unexpected, and it was clearly a water floating city. The ships selling vegetables, boats driving shops, households, repaired boats, trafficking boats, ferry boats, water police boats, fish -collecting boats, boats to visit, catering boats, cleaner ships, seafood selling seafood, selling seafood, sales of seafood, sales of seafood, sales of seafood, sales of seafood, sales of seafood, sales of seafood, sales of seafood, sales of seafood, sales of seafood, and seafood sold The boat, the luxurious ship, the humble ship, the dilapidated ship, the brand -new boat, the hurried boat, the slow boat ... I can&#39;t help but remind me of the Americans William C. Hunter&#39;s to the Pearl River Estuary in 198. Description: &quot;The river is covered with local ships ... In addition, there are 舢舨, as well as 舢舨, and the ferry of Henan (&lt;span style =&quot; font-family: regular body, regular body_gb2312, stkaiti; &quot;>; South Bank of Zhujiang &lt;/span>;) There are also some razor boats and the sale of daily necessities sold by all kinds of food, clothes, toys and shops on the shore shop. &quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; A Po slows slowly and moves closer to a stove in a pot. Over there, put his hands early; here, Zhu Grando praised the sentence &quot;good business&quot; and restored the speed of the boat. It turned out that it was a &quot;powder boat&quot; specializing in fish and egg powder and roasting powder. In the 1960s and 1970s, Hong Kong&#39;s fishery production entered its peak, and the &quot;Fanzai Boat&quot; was also popular, and it was everywhere to avoid the wind ponds. In addition to fishermen and crew members frequently patronized, citizens and tourists also came here to show off the boat on the shore. Now, there are three or two boats doing it regularly. &quot;Eat and eat, you are lucky.&quot; Grandma Zhu went on to say. &quot;&lt;/P>; &lt;p>; It also needs&quot; luck &quot;, as well as Zhu Daxian&#39;s party in the wind pond. According to Zhu Gauxian, Zhu Daxian, who will be sacrificed by Zhu Daxian, is the Eight Precepts of the Pig. He has been in charge of Tianhe, and is regarded as a sea god by the waterfront of Hong Kong. Family: Kaiti, Kai Trioons_GB2312, Stkaiti; &quot;>; Godfather &lt;/span>;)&quot; &quot;&quot; &quot;is second only to the queen mother&#39;s ancestor. Among all the crickets in Hong Kong and Macau, only Zhu Daxian will be held at sea every year, so it is also called the water surface. Since the meeting period is not fixed, when the meeting is not fixed, when the meeting is not fixed, you have to ask for a question in advance. Whether you can bite in his prosperity, completely &quot;luck&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In countless ships, we found one, no, two Zhu Daxian Temple. It seems that it is transformed from a double -layer cruise ship. The top flagpole is towering, and the fluttering yellow triangle red flag reflects Yu Xia Xia at the setting sun. The reason why there are two, Zhu Grandma explained because &quot;Lao Zhu Daxian&quot; needs to lead the &quot;new Zhu Daxian&quot; to be familiar with the personnel of the Fengtang. After some days, he has completely handed over the work. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;img alt = &quot;Sitting and watching the sunset is one of the&quot; compulsory courses &quot;to travel to Hong Kong. /Image/23/12/02/fae0742e11.jpg &quot;border =&quot; 0 &quot;width =&quot; 1080 &quot;height =&quot; 719 &quot;data-src =&quot; // Images.infzm.com/mdias/image/23/12 /02/fae0742e11.jpg &quot;data-key =&quot; 260449 &quot;>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style =&quot; color: #999999; &quot;>; Sitting to watch the sunset is one of the&quot; required courses &quot;for Hong Kong Zai. &amp; nbsp; Photo Pang Mian &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Return to the boat and go through the &quot;site&quot; of the treasure seafood.

Hu Geli River &lt;span style = &quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>; (visual China/picture) &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Recently, the Indian Navy proposed the need to buy French SCALP long -range cruise missiles, hoping to use this missile As a standard anti-ship and ground attack weapon equipped with 26 &quot;gusts&quot; -M carrier-based aircraft equipped with the aircraft carrier &quot;Victor&quot;. One month ago, Ukraine used the SCALP cruise missile to destroy a Russian and Black Sea fleet submarine that is repairing in the Crimea dock. This is the only submarine sunk by the cruise missile so far. In addition, the SCALP missile also hit the headquarters of the Black Sea Fleet, which performed well in actual combat. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; However, this is not the only naval equipment recently purchased from France. On October 28, 2023, the Indian Navy just submitted a purchase request for 26 array -based carrier -based aircraft to the French government. The carrier -based aircraft is fully replaced with the French gusts, not the Russian -made MiG fighter that has been upgraded for many years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The procurement plan is by no means simple, which is part of the Indian ambitious navy reorganization plan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In 2022, the Indian Navy Ajendra Bahadur Singh (Ajndra Bahadur Singh) told the media: &quot;Some naval ships will retire in the next few years, while Increasing some ships, we hope that in 15 years (&lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_GB2312, stkaiti;&quot;>; 2037 &lt;/span>;) The number of naval ships can reach more than 200 ships. &quot;&lt;/ P>; &lt;p>; Since India&#39;s independence in 1948, the Indian Navy has always hoped to be a Blue Water Navy with 142 ships and operating two aircraft carriers at the same time. The target of the ship seems to be a bit difficult. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The difficulty of expansion of the Indian Navy is far from the problem that is far from 200, but India not only needs to increase 68 ships in 15 years, but also needs to be mostly equipped with the main equipment equipment of the Navy in these 15 years. NATO. This also means that at least one -third of the main ships in India&#39;s active duty, which are more than 40, to complete the preliminary NATO goal. In this case, India must equip more than 100 ships within 15 years, while India now equips about about 4 ships every year. At this speed, the Indian Navy may only maintain the current scale, not to mention India&#39;s grand equipment expansion of equipment expansion The plan also includes a new aircraft carrier, which is undoubtedly difficult to add. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; From a practical point of view, the Indian navy reorganization plan may not be as magnificent as it claims. The Indian Navy has long relied on Russia&#39;s supply equipment for a long time, while Russia has lost huge losses in the war. The supporting chain of large surface ships in the Soviet era is mostly in Ukraine. Since the Crimean crisis in 2014, Russia has not been able to obtain Ukrainian supporting products. As a result, its large surface ships have difficulty even maintenance and maintenance, and it may not be able to continue to supply India in the future. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; When India had previously cooperated with Russia to cooperate with the &quot;Super Kings&quot; aircraft carrier reconstruction project, the progress was procrastinating and seriously overdue. India had realized that it was difficult to rely on Russia at the time, so they had begun to build large surface ships by themselves. Industry Planning. Helplessly, India was sanctioned by the United States for nuclear weapons at the time, and could only continue military cooperation with Russia. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In recent years, with the rapid heating up with the United States, India&#39;s navy equipment self -made plan is accelerating. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In 2022, the first local aircraft carrier &quot;Vikrant&quot; manufactured by the Indian Kachin Shipyard Co., Ltd. (CSL) was officially served, marking that India has the ability to build an aircraft carrier -though this ship Difficulty aircraft carriers have been delayed from work to formal service, and the Indian Navy has been waiting for 17 years for this. However, compared with the aircraft carrier, the construction of the Indian domestic destroyer can be said to be quite smooth. The first ship has been serving from 2011 to 2021. It only takes ten years, and is continuously launching at a speed of one year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; At present, India has built three 7,000 tons of Vishacapartan destroyers on its own. The ship has an invisible appearance and shield air defense system. India claims that its localization rate has reached 75%. It is a model for Indian warship countries. It can be seen that the Indian shipbuilding industry is at least on the large main ship of the construction destroyer. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Another favorable Indian shipbuilding industry is the signing agreement in India and the United States in 2021, announcing that India will become the U.S. Navy&#39;s future large -scale equipment maintenance center in the Indo -Pacific region. In 2022, the US -India 2+2 Ministerial Dialogue announced that the United States intends to inspect the Indian shipyard. Immediately after, the US Navy Charles Druc (T-AKE-10) stopped at the Katapari Shipyard for maintenance and repair. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; This agreement means that the United States will help India improve the maintenance and construction capacity of large warships, and even directly provide technical cooperation to allow India to master the construction and maintenance technology of large American warships, as well as related technical standards and management process. From the experience of Japan and South Korea, the United States&#39; cooperation weapons and equipment maintenance bases established in the North Korea after the Korean War have played a key role in improving the local shipbuilding technology technology and the optimization of management processes. Especially for countries such as South Korea, independent after World War II, the lack of weak talents in its own industrial foundation, and the technical support provided by the United States is essential for its industrial system. Thanks to this, South Korea has established its own military industry, or even even Now it has begun to become a new type of weapon and equipment exporter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Although India ’s main war equipment has a long -term poor manufacturing capability, it has to admit that it already has its own manufacturing capabilities at least in terms of naval equipment. Part of the logistics system for military equipment in the United States. Considering that India&#39;s economic development momentum is strong, and the U.S. and Europe&#39;s technical restrictions on their technical restrictions are almost completely lifted. Therefore, it is possible to replace the original Soviet system in 15 years to make its navy equipment Westernization. In the case of scale, vomiting the new goal can be fully achieved. As for whether it can be expanded to the scale of 200 ships, it also depends on the execution capabilities of the Indian shipbuilding industry and economic development. However, it is foreseeable that with the help of Western technology, the combat effectiveness of the Indian naval ships will definitely improve significantly, which is also the goal of the hope of the United States and Indian military cooperation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;/p>; &lt;br>; &lt;hr>; &lt;div>; Get more RSS: &lt;br>; &lt;a href = &quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style = &quot;color: orange&quot; target = &quot;_blank&quot;>; https://feedx.net &lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.run&quot; style=&quot;cone&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>; https: // feedx. run &lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 03 Dec 2023 08:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[北极光：极夜中的极致绚烂]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261722]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;i>; 2023-12-02 22:00:00 &lt;/i>; &lt;/div>; &lt;br>; &lt;hr>; &lt;div>; Get more RSS: &lt;br>; &lt;a href = &quot;https: /// Feedx.net &quot;style =&quot; color: orange &quot;target =&quot; _blank &quot;>; https://feedx.net &lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;a href =&quot; https://feedx.run &quot;style =&quot; Color: Orange &quot;target =&quot; _blank &quot;>; https://feedx.run &lt;/a>; &lt;br>; &lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 02 Dec 2023 22:25:03 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
