One day, I received a call from the village cadre saying that several trees next to his own grain drying field outside the village needed to be cut down. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These are some poplar trees that my father planted next to the grain drying farm more than ten years ago. Although they were planted at the same time, several trees grew unevenly. The largest one was more than 30 centimeters in diameter at breast height and I couldn&#39;t wrap my arms around it, while the smallest one was no more than the width of a bowl. My mother said that maybe they were planted too densely, and the weaker ones couldn&#39;t compete with the stronger ones, so they grew slower and slower. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After chatting with the village cadres for a while, I learned that cutting down trees was required by the superiors. This time, in addition to a few trees in my house, all the trees planted by villagers in nearby fields will be cut down: &quot;This time, all these trees in the fields south of the road must be cut down, and there is no bargaining.&quot; It is said that the County Land and Resources Bureau received satellite photos (&quot;satellite photos&quot;) sent by superiors, which circled many places in our county and said that these are cultivated lands, and those with trees must be cut down, and those with greenhouses must be demolished. All the land was restored to cultivated land. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ordinarily, our trees grow beside the grain drying field and are not planted in the ground. Strictly speaking, the grain drying farm is agricultural facility land, not farmland. How did this small grain drying field with only a few dozen square meters turn into cultivated land? Maybe it’s because my parents have been in poor health in recent years and have farmed a lot less land. This drying field has basically not been used. It is covered with grass in summer, so it is regarded as cultivated land in the satellite film? Or maybe those who watched the satellite films didn&#39;t make a careful distinction at all, but just drew a random picture and concluded that all the land south of a certain road was cultivated land, and if it was changed to other uses, it would be restored? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, such problems are not uncommon in the process of &quot;satellite film law enforcement&quot;. More than half a month ago, a doctoral student from the School of Social Sciences of Wuhan University also mentioned a similar issue in an article. The superior land and resources department determines land use based on the changes in the &quot;patterns&quot; of satellite photos over the past few years. If it is found that the original cultivated land has turned into forests or houses have been built, it will issue a notice asking the local government to &quot;enforce the law&quot; and return the land to farming. But the problem is that the use of some land is more complicated and has changed many times in history. Just looking at satellite images without carefully studying the nature of the land and its changes can easily lead to problems. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;And due to the insufficient resolution of the satellite images used in land surveys in previous years, some relatively small roads and other construction lands were not identified and were all classified as cultivated land. Nowadays, with technology upgrades, satellite photos The resolution has been greatly improved, and the road in the middle of the farmland could be distinguished. However, it turned out that it was considered illegal to occupy land for road construction and needed to be rectified. Just like my family&#39;s grain-drying field, it was also zoned as cultivated land, and the trees planted next to it had to be cut down. These mechanical &quot;law enforcement&quot; that do not study the actual situation and only look at pictures on satellite films, the pressure is directly transmitted to the grassroots, and conflicts between cadres and farmers are commonplace. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In our county, due to the reduction of rural population and lack of labor force, a lot of land cannot be cultivated. Moreover, most of the land in our village is hilly and sloping, and it is difficult to divert water for irrigation. We basically rely on the sky for food, and the harvest from farming is not high. For farmers, switching to planting trees may not bring much income from selling trees, but at least they don’t have to work hard every year. A few years ago, the government also encouraged afforestation and even provided subsidies for planting trees, so some villages also planted trees on their farmland. Nowadays, it is necessary to &quot;return forests to farmland&quot; and cut down all the trees that are just about to become useful. This will naturally harm the interests of farmers and cause many people to not understand. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, there are indeed some good lands, and it is a pity to plant trees. For example, the neighboring village has thousands of acres of flat land beside a small river. There is water in the river. It was the &quot;irrigated land&quot; that everyone envied back then, and it was very suitable for growing wheat and corn. Later, these lands were also planted with trees. When I passed by my hometown a few years ago, I felt quite emotional. These patches of cultivated land have good soil quality and water for irrigating, and large agricultural machinery can be used to reduce manpower. Perhaps after the cultivated land is restored, it can be collectively contracted to large households for growing food through circulation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for the barren mountainous land in our village, even if it is converted back to cultivated land, there will be no one in the village who can cultivate it. After all, the more than 200 people who still stay in the village all year round are mostly six-year-olds. For a seventy-year-old man, these fragmented lands are difficult to carry out large-scale mechanized farming. Even if all the trees are cut down, the final result is likely to be abandoned. So what’s the point of cutting down trees and “still plowing”? Will we spend money to hire people to grow food in the future? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, although there are doubts, the old people in the village are relatively honest, and most of them will not delve into it. If it says it needs to be cut, then just do it. After all, cutting down trees is now the task of the village cadres, and many of the villagers are related to the village cadres, or at least they are neighbors who never see each other without looking up. The villagers do not want to make it too difficult for them. It&#39;s not worth breaking up for a few trees. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to the village cadres, there were also two businessmen from nearby villages who specialized in cutting down and buying trees. They negotiated the price on the spot, and they would come to cut down the trees and take them away the next day. There was no need to sell the trees in the whole process. People worry. However, since trees are being cut down everywhere now, the price is naturally much cheaper. A few years ago, someone offered 200 yuan to buy the largest tree, but my mother thought the price was too low and refused to sell it. Now, the five trees can only be sold for 200 yuan in total. This was because the person who bought the tree was an acquaintance from my mother’s natal village and was given a preferential price. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 10 Oct 2023 08:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[女子称学信网显示“结业”错失高薪工作：学历问题事关诚信，理应严肃以待丨快评]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258303]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-09 23:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Recently, an &quot;academic qualification news&quot; has attracted attention. According to the &quot;Yangtze Evening News&quot; report, Ms. Lu from Shanghai reported that Hunan Normal University issued her a graduation certificate and degree certificate when she graduated as an undergraduate, but the Xuexin website showed that she had graduated, which led to the company she was applying for doubting when she changed jobs. He made false claims and failed to pass the review, missing out on a job opportunity with a monthly salary of more than 40,000 yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ms. Lu said that the school refused to change back to graduation status because her Mandarin scores were unsatisfactory at that time. &quot;But when she graduated in 2002, the major did not have this requirement at all.&quot; In June 2023, Ms. Lu will Hunan Normal University went to court and asked the school to change its Xuexin.com status to graduated. On October 6, the school refused to mediate before trial. The Changsha Railway Transport Court determined that Ms. Lu graduated in 2002, which exceeded the maximum prosecution period for administrative litigation, and dismissed the lawsuit. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The matter has evolved to this point, and public opinion is mostly on the side of the woman involved. A closer look at this incident reveals that there are still many details that need to be analyzed one by one before a correct conclusion can be drawn. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First of all, judging from the time when this case is presented, there are still many factual issues that need to be determined. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The main reason for the prosecution and defense of the woman involved is that she received the graduation certificate and degree certificate issued by the school, and she graduated early; the school should not use the &quot;Putonghua test failed to meet the standard&quot; as an excuse to use the Xuexin.com The status was changed from &quot;graduated&quot; to &quot;completed&quot; because she was not a teacher major and should not have this graduation requirement; the court&#39;s determination of the prosecution period should be adjusted to start when she &quot;learned of the prosecution period&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The issue of &quot;early graduation&quot; and the woman involved&#39;s two certificates are the basic facts that need to be clarified urgently in this case. As we all know, those who are eligible to apply for early graduation must have completed all courses with excellent results within three years, completed the defense of their graduation thesis, and must also meet other graduation requirements. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Judging from the graduation certificate and degree certificate published in media reports, the woman in question did indeed obtain these two paper certificates issued in June 2002. So, did the woman in question, who enrolled in school in 1999, &quot;leave school on her own initiative&quot; or &quot;graduate early&quot; in 2002? Does the non-teaching major she majored in when she left school have a Mandarin test as a graduation requirement? What procedural problems occurred between the time the woman in question obtained the two certificates and the time when the school uploaded the status to the Xuexin.com as &quot;graduated&quot;? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Judging from the school’s defense reasons, the school gave two explanations. First, the woman’s Mandarin test scores were not up to standard, so she could only upload “graduation” on the Xuexin website; The two certificates in the woman&#39;s hands &quot;were found to be not issued by the school in accordance with procedures,&quot; and there were procedural issues. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There may be two possibilities: one is that the woman in question had no problem in obtaining the two certificates, but the school refused to upload the correct information to the Xuexin website; the other is that the two certificates in the hands of the woman in question were There is a problem with the certificate. If the application is issued in violation of regulations or is issued incorrectly, the school will only &quot;come to its senses&quot; after the fact, so it can only correct it when uploading information to Xuexin.com. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Therefore, the school needs to respond to the following questions: Since graduation certificates and degree certificates were not issued in accordance with procedures, who was responsible for issuing the certificates at that time? What means did the woman in question use to obtain two illegal certificates? Afterwards, since the school realized that the two certificates were not in compliance with the procedures, why did it not notify the woman in time and take back the certificate, and only found a replacement on the Xuexin website? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, the student status files during college, the memories of teachers and classmates, the original transcript that the woman in question claimed to have in her hand, the school’s official graduation requirements for non-teaching majors at the time, and the actions of the school’s degree evaluators at that time, obtained It is not too difficult to obtain sufficient written and oral evidence to distinguish right from wrong. If this case enters the second instance, both parties will need to rely on these original evidences to piece together the full story of the incident. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Secondly, the issue of information uploaded on Xuexin.com also deserves further clarification. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Judging from the administrative ruling provided by the court, the woman involved claimed that “checking through the Xuexin.com showed completion instead of graduation, the date of birth was registered incorrectly and the degree certificate information was not uploaded.” . Judging from the screenshots reported by the media, the woman in question was born on June 8, while the information on Xuexin Online stated that she was born on June 11. Such errors of month and day will inevitably leave the outside world with the impression that the school is sloppy. This is something the school needs to explain. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, we should also ask, when did the school upload the information from Xuexin.com? Why was the woman involved not notified in time when uploading the information on Xuexin.com? Public information shows that Xuexin.com &quot;completed the construction of a database of higher education qualifications since 1991&quot; in October 2003. If the woman involved learns about the time limit for prosecution, the reason for rejection is &quot;the twenty-year prosecution period has expired.&quot; There are areas worth debating. At least it should be clear about the exact time when the school uploads the information to Xuexin.com so that the court can determine the time limit for prosecution. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Thirdly, this incident caused some waves in the public opinion field. Some people think that even if the woman in question really just graduated, since she can find a high-paying job based on her skills, it would be too harsh to have her employment affected by her academic qualifications from 20 years ago. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This argument received a lot of support. However, although the importance of academic qualifications cannot be generalized, it does have its significance and value on different occasions and at various time points. In fact, employers vary widely, and so do the personal circumstances of applicants. If the person concerned has a problem with his or her academic qualifications and has not encountered any obstacles to employment in the past, it does not mean that an employer that is willing to provide a high-paying job will not happen to take advantage of this. Employers have greater discretion over whether and how important an applicant&#39;s academic qualifications are, not to mention that falsification involves integrity issues. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In short, many details of this case are murky, and both the woman involved and the school need stronger evidence for their arguments. The issue of academic qualifications is a matter of integrity and should be taken seriously. Now that this case has become a public issue, it is necessary for the school to conduct an in-depth investigation into this academic qualifications incident, produce more original evidence, restore the truth, set the record straight, and respond to external concerns. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 09 Oct 2023 23:25:05 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[高铁超员报警无法发车，广州南站通报]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258313]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-09 22:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;[Explanation on the online overcrowding alarm of G541 train]&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2023 October On March 6, the G541 train from Zhengzhou East to Guangzhou South arrived at Shaoguan Station.

I always feel very awkward, because when we were studying, the word &quot;jiá&quot; was the original word for &quot;stop suddenly&quot; and &quot;jiá&quot;. Check &quot;Chinese Dictionary&quot; and &quot;Hanyu Dictionary&quot; and you will find that this word is not polyphonic even now. Only when the word &quot;口&quot; is added next to it, can you pronounce &quot;GA [ɡā]&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It’s different now. The &quot;Modern Chinese Dictionary&quot; probably started from the 6th edition (I don’t have an earlier version at hand), and added the sound ɡā to this word. There is only one meaning below: &quot;Cannes (ɡā&amp;nbsp ;nà), French place name.&quot; This means that as a transliterated word, &quot;ɡā&amp;nbsp;nà&quot; can be pronounced loudly and openly. If you correct this reading, you are wrong. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Actually, this is a double misunderstanding. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Cannes International Film Festival (Cannes International Film Festival) is named after the place where it is held. According to the principle of following the owner, it is translated as Cannes. It is the translation closest to the French pronunciation, which is translated as &quot;Cannes&quot; , it’s too far away to be measured. This was originally an error made by the translators at that time in determining the translation name due to lack of audio-visual information. Checking the newspaper database of the Republic of China, there was a news report in the &quot;Central Daily News&quot; on August 18, 1944, &quot;France occupied nine towns eight miles deep, and the Allies took control of Cannes and forced Toulon.&quot; It can be seen that this translation has a long history, but At that time, there were more news articles using &quot;Cancheng&quot;. It can be seen that newspapers in the late Qing Dynasty and the Republic of China put a lot of effort into reviewing and naming. Unfortunately, later generations chose the mistranslated one. &quot;Modern Chinese Dictionary&quot;, as a dictionary that takes normativeness as its own responsibility, should not use &quot;convention&quot; (not &quot;custom&quot;) as &quot;I follow the crowd&quot; (not necessarily &quot;the crowd&quot;) on the basis of mistranslation. As an excuse, he proposed a new pronunciation for the word &quot;Jia&quot; that has no basis in literature. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;General British and American people are probably confused about the pronunciation of the place name Cannes. In 2013, the Fox TV station with the highest ratings in the United States (the audience is mainly American &quot;red necks&quot;) once launched a Twitter Based on a small investigation, the reporter combined the discussions among fans and wrote a very humorous short article: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/how-to-pronounce-cannes-cans-can-or- con&quot;>;&lt;span>;&lt;u>;How to pronounce Cannes: Cans, can or con? | Fox News&lt;/u>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/a>;, the conclusion is that it should be pronounced &quot;Kan&quot;, and the pronunciation is between English between the words can and ken. The online pronunciation of &quot;Cambridge English Dictionary&quot; is the same as when can is stressed:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/pronunciation/english/cannes&quot;>;&lt; span>;&lt;u>;https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/pronunciation/english/cannes&lt;/u>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/a>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;You can predict with the &quot;Modern Chinese Dictionary&quot; &quot;With the blessing of &quot;Cannes (ɡā&amp;nbsp;nà)&quot;, the translation of &quot;Cannes (ɡā&amp;nbsp;nà)&quot;, which is &quot;uniquely made in Cannes&quot;, is bound to become popular, and all efforts to block the car will &quot;come to an abrupt end&quot;. No matter how reluctant you are, I am afraid you can only make mistakes. &quot;Gaga&quot; started to learn the language. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 09 Oct 2023 21:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[四川多地曝医疗腐败，宜宾上千人被处理]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258307]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-09 20:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;More than 1,100 medical staff took the initiative to surrender and explain the problems.

Rotten details. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In June 2022, the First Inspection Team of the Xuzhou District Committee of Yibin City received a letter of complaint while inspecting the Sixth People’s Hospital of Yibin City. The informant reported that after the urology department of the hospital performed an operation on the patient, the patient directly transferred the operation fee to the head nurse instead of paying through the hospital window. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After receiving clues from the inspection team, the task force of the Xuzhou District Discipline Inspection and Supervision Committee conducted an investigation into the Department of Urology and quickly determined that this was the order of Luo Xiance, the director of the department. However, Luo Xiance did not realize the seriousness of the problem. When the investigation team first talked to him, he explained the problems of the department&#39;s private treasury and accepting drug kickbacks, and said, &quot;If the worst happens, I will refund the money.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After Luo Xiance was investigated, the disciplinary and illegal violations of Jiang Huashan, the party secretary of the hospital, also surfaced. According to the investigators of the task force, &quot;Following the clues of medical representatives returning kickbacks to hospital public officials, we dug into the issue of Jiang Huashan, the party secretary of the hospital, who was suspected of accepting bribes, and took measures to detain him.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; After investigation, Jiang Huashan took advantage of his position as Secretary of the Party Committee and President of the Sixth Hospital to open accounts in the hospital for relevant companies, and provided services to more than 10 pharmaceutical companies in the introduction and sales of drugs, equipment, and consumables, construction of engineering projects, and payment collection. The representatives provided help, and the amount of bribes they received was as high as more than 6 million yuan, and the medical representatives obtained improper benefits of more than 30 million yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Driven by Jiang Huashan’s corruption and the interests of high kickbacks, corruption has become common within Yibin Sixth People’s Hospital. A small number of hospital managers did not care about medical skills, and once only wanted to make money. There was even a ridiculous phenomenon in which the deputy director of the department passively sabotaged his work when the rebates for consumables were unevenly distributed, and used the excuse of resignation to force the director to share more of the stolen money. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Under the strong shock of the serious disciplinary and illegal cases of Jiang Huashan and Luo Xiance, the Yibin Municipal Commission for Discipline Inspection and Supervision also launched simultaneous educational warnings throughout the city.

In the video, Xie Mingjun cried: &quot;I hate myself and have done a lot of ridiculous things. What do I need so much money for?&quot; Yang Li also cried bitterly: &quot;How can I support myself after being released from prison after more than ten years?&quot;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;According to the &quot;Integrity Sichuan&quot; WeChat public account, Xie Mingjun went from director of general surgery to model dean, national second-level professor, and academic expert. When faced with unscrupulous businessmen coming from all directions, he did not resist the temptation. Start accepting &quot;rebates&quot; and &quot;favorable fees&quot; from drug dealers and equipment manufacturers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the Yibin First People&#39;s Hospital, hospital leaders, pharmaceutical committees, pharmacy departments, departments and medical staff were infiltrated by unscrupulous drug dealers and purchased drugs with kickbacks. Bribery payments generally reached 30% of the drug price, up to 50%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The relevant person in charge of the Yibin Municipal Commission for Discipline Inspection and Supervision pointed out that this case not only exposed the loopholes in the internal supervision and management of Yibin First People&#39;s Hospital and the construction of medical ethics and medical ethics, but also exposed the problems in the city&#39;s medical system. Common problems existing in the supervision and management of centralized drug procurement. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After Xie Mingjun was detained, Shi Jun, the retired former party secretary and president of the Fifth People’s Hospital of Yibin, also failed to escape investigation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to his confession, during his 23 years in office, he took advantage of his position, accepted various bribes, and used ill-gotten gains to purchase 8 cars and 7 properties, including a Porsche Cayenne, a Mercedes-Benz S300, Touareg has real estate mainly in Sichuan, Yunnan, Hainan and other places, and has about 6 million yuan in cash. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From serving as the dean in 1999 to retiring to the second line in 2021, Shi Jun has firmly grasped the full say in the hospital&#39;s commercial procurement, personnel appointments and dismissals, infrastructure, etc., and cultivated confidants in key positions to ensure smooth communication. A channel through which power can be realized. The &quot;paternalistic&quot; style has already eroded the rules and regulations to pieces, making the hospital management and employees surrender to them, and internal supervision is completely out of control. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the &quot;Integrity Outlook&quot; report, Yibin City has detained 13 public officials, including 3 county-level cadres, including 11 &quot;top leaders&quot;, and used &quot;four forms&quot; to deal with more than 1,200 people . &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;The dean of the county hospital’s under-construction inpatient buildings has been “taken as a shareholder and receive dividends”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In addition to Yibin, there are also corruption cases in the medical field in Neijiang, Deyang and other places in Sichuan Equally shocking. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since July last year, Neijiang Municipal Commission for Discipline Inspection and Supervision has successively reported and exposed Liu Yu, the former Party Secretary of Dongxing District People’s Hospital of Neijiang City, Liu Xiaoping, the former director of Zizhong County Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital, and the former Longchang Municipal People’s Hospital. Zhang Zongming and others were expelled from the party and public offices for serious violations of discipline and law. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In April 2022, the Neijiang Municipal Commission for Discipline Inspection and Supervision received clues about Zhang Zongming, the former director of Longchang Municipal People’s Hospital, regarding disciplinary and illegal violations. In view of the large number of projects in the medical and health system, the large amounts involved, and the complex local relationship network Regarding the situation, the Discipline Inspection and Supervision Commissions of Neijiang City and Dongxing District simultaneously intervened in the investigation and found that the amount involved in the case by Zhang Zongming amounted to more than 15 million yuan. In October of the same year, Zhang Zongming was expelled from the party and public office for serious violations of discipline and law. He was sentenced to ten years and nine months in prison by the Dongxing District People&#39;s Court for accepting bribes. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Recently, the &quot;Integrity Sichuan&quot; WeChat public account disclosed the corruption path of Liu Xiaoping, the former deputy party secretary and president of Zizhong County Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital in Neijiang. From &quot;saying hello&quot; in hospital procurement to &quot;sharing dividends&quot; in engineering construction, he accepted all orders regardless of the amount or property. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu Xiaoping not only charges &quot;thank you fees&quot; for purchasing drugs and medical equipment, but even the field of engineering construction has become a &quot;nursing place&quot; for him to make money. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2009, when the Zizhong County People&#39;s Hospital was building a new inpatient building, the project owner Peng Mou promised to share a certain amount of profits with Liu Xiaoping after the project was completed in the name of &quot;buying shares&quot; to jointly undertake the construction. The project progress payment was disbursed as scheduled, and Liu Xiaoping received the first &quot;shareholding dividend&quot; of 600,000 yuan. In the following five years, Liu Xiao would receive an average &quot;dividend&quot; each time the project progress payment was disbursed, totaling 2.8 million yuan. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Subsequently, Liu Xiaoping accepted everything from a pack of cigarettes and a few bottles of wine to 10,000 to 20,000 yuan in cash to hundreds of thousands of yuan in cash, no matter the amount or the amount of property. From 2008 to 2021, Liu Xiaoping took advantage of his position to make a lot of money in drug procurement, engineering construction, etc., providing convenience for others to allocate funds for drugs, medical equipment, medical equipment, and engineering funds, and accepting gifts from others. The total amount of cash received was 17.587 million yuan, and the cumulative amount received in violation of disciplines and laws reached 20.1209 million yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On September 14 this year, the &quot;Integrity Sichuan&quot; WeChat public account announced that Zhang Dejun, former deputy secretary of the Party Committee and president of Deyang Second People&#39;s Hospital, had seriously violated discipline and law and was expelled from the party and public office. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The report pointed out that Zhang Dejun accepted gifts and gifts that may affect the fair execution of official duties, was passive and slack in his work, was superficial, and had problems with formalism and bureaucracy; violated organizational principles, and acted inappropriately during the recruitment of employees.

Many &quot;Foreigners&quot; have all heard: Chinese elderly parents take care of their children in the morning, do housework during the day, and take care of the whole family at night. It is harder than working, and it is free, and they even use their own pensions to subsidize their children. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Someone posted on the Internet the daily schedule of elderly parents and parents-in-law: starting from 6 a.m., while their sons, daughters, daughters-in-law, and sons-in-law are still asleep, the elderly get up and go to the vegetable market to buy food. The freshest vegetables. Then prepare breakfast, change the grandchildren&#39;s diapers, feed the grandchildren, and greet the children, daughter-in-law, and husband-in-law to wake up and have breakfast. After the adults went to work, the old man did not stop. He was busy all morning, cleaning the house and taking care of his grandchildren several times, including feeding and urinating. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At noon, the elderly are preparing lunch one after another, and some younger generations go home for lunch (in first-tier metropolises such as Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen, there is almost no possibility of going home for lunch), and then they can take a rest, because The grandchildren are taking a lunch break. A few hours later, the grandchild woke up, changed diapers, fed milk, and then took her downstairs to the community garden to play and bask in the sun. After returning, the old man continued to cook dinner, and then the children, daughter-in-law, and husband-in-law went home for dinner, washed pots and dishes, and took care of the children to sleep...&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It was really busy from morning to night, far exceeding the labor law stipulated, as well as the 8-hour daily shift in the domestic industry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This kind of work even leads to conflicts: in the circle of friends, there is a son who has a child. His parents come to Beijing to help take care of him and hire a nanny, but he is extremely busy every day. It’s early for his son to come home at 10:30 p.m., and the couple often can’t sleep until after 12 p.m. The old man cooked three meals for seven people. His daughter-in-law required that the dishes and chopsticks should be scalded with boiling water and sterilized for each meal. Due to different living habits, the old man sometimes forgets, so it often makes trouble. His wife said, &quot;How about we run away secretly?&quot; Let’s go home.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A friend came back from the UK to visit relatives and took her foreign husband and mother-in-law to travel to China. Her foreign mother-in-law was afraid to come at first for fear of becoming a &quot;Chinese grandma.&quot; After arriving, I saw that almost all of the community was elderly people taking care of their children, and I said seriously, &quot;This is the biggest irresponsibility for children.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The theory of foreign mothers-in-law is: 1. It is more conducive for children to grow up if they are brought up by their own parents and enhances the relationship between them and their parents. 2. Intergenerational education will produce contradictions and conflicts. Because the world of the elderly is the past few decades, and there is a big gap between the world of the children and the future decades, the children they cultivate have many weaknesses in their character. 3. Where are the life, space and rights of the elderly? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The foreign old lady also said: Foreign elderly people all have plans for their old age. She also wants to travel around the world, participate in community activities, prune roses in the garden, and write memoirs (we may wonder: what kind of memoirs do ordinary people write? ?). She believes that Chinese elderly people are very empty inside. They have been pushed away by work before retirement and have become fallen leaves with no &quot;pushing&quot; motivation behind them and no sense of direction. Therefore, they have no choice but to find a sense of presence in their own children and even intervene in the lives of their grandchildren, just like He works hard like a martyr and places the value of his life on the dependence, respect and gratitude of his children, grandchildren and other young people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This old lady also believes that children should be independent after turning 18, live on campus when they go to college, rent their own house when working, have their own boyfriend and girlfriend, and apply for unemployment benefits if they are unfortunate enough to lose their jobs. ...How can you reach your 30s and still use your parents&#39; pension to use your parents as slave labor on the pretext of being grandchildren? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Westerners’ life style, social environment, way of thinking, etc. are all very different from ours. It does not mean that their views and lifestyles are correct and advanced. It is right to listen to the objectionable words as foreign voices. Some views can cause reflection. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;rights&quot; that Westerners talk about actually have their counterpart here: for the elderly to help you take care of your children is a matter of affection, not an obligation. This is true whether it is in terms of law, social ethics, or family and emotional aspects. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Our Eastern culture uses family settlements and blood relationships as ties to weave its own atmosphere of life. Therefore, we pay attention to the intertwining and entanglement of &quot;father&#39;s kindness and son&#39;s filial piety&quot;, mutual debt, repayment of family affection, and gratitude... In Confucian culture, it is called &quot;kissing&quot;, and in other parts of East Asia, it is also called &quot;righteousness&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The modern/modern changes in Asia-Pacific society driven by the &quot;Western Wind Spreading from the East&quot; for more than a hundred years have made East Asian societies pay more and more attention to individual rights in modern society on the basis of &quot;kinship&quot; culture. It may simplify and weaken the social relationship of mutual entanglement and debt between relatives and friends. More and more young people are beginning to pursue individual rights, individual development, and individual realization that are similar to Westernization. In recent decades, wages in East Asian societies have grown faster than in Western societies, which is evidence of this development. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, we only need the &quot;individualism&quot; of Western culture, but not its concept of &quot;equivalence of rights and obligations&quot;; we need both the &quot;self-realization&quot; benefits of Western culture and the &quot;kissing&quot; of Eastern culture. Benefits, taking advantage of parents, but unwilling to take any responsibility. For example, the son mentioned above came home from playing until 10:30 in the evening (so-called socializing and socializing). This is too unethical. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Due to our living habits, it is impossible for us to copy the Western lifestyle. However, it should become a social responsibility to clarify the boundaries of the rights of the elderly, yourself, children and grandchildren, and not to take advantage of your parents all your life. At least, you cannot treat your parents as long-term workers who do not have to pay, or even use them as long-term workers while &quot;gnawing at the elderly&quot; and taking out the wallets of elderly parents. Basic consensus. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This problem is on the children&#39;s side on the one hand and the elderly parents on the other. I often hear elderly people say: their children are too busy and hard at work, so help them if you can. This kind of thinking is: children will never grow up. The children they cultivate are also happy to lie in their parents&#39; arms until they are fifty or sixty years old. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Do the elderly in Western societies help their children and grandchildren? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The answer is yes. According to statistics from the U.S. &quot;Population and Development Review&quot;: nearly 1/3 of the elderly in the United States have helped take care of their families. Americans spend a total of 1.2 billion hours caring for their families each week, equivalent to 30.5 million &quot;nanny&quot; positions. 20% of elderly Americans said they had taken their grandchildren on vacation without their parents. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Statistics show that Americans in their 30s take care of the most children, followed by “grandfathers and grandmothers” in their 60s, while elderly people aged 60-79 rarely help take care of their grandchildren. Especially older American men in this age group are least willing to take care of babies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;79% of older people in the UK say they feel spending time with their grandchildren helps them stay young. But less than a third of British elderly people believe that they have &quot;taught their grandchildren more.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;How British elders look after their children: prepare tea or dinner for their grandchildren, supervise their children for a few hours after school when their parents are unable to arrive due to work, and play card games with their children. , and teaching children how to be brave. British grandparents proudly say they spend nearly 10 hours a week with their grandchildren. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It can be seen that in general, in European and American societies, there are limits to the elderly&#39;s ability to help their children, and the elderly&#39;s love for their children and grandchildren is also more restrained. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We spend an average of 1.5 hours together every day. According to our standards, this is not taking care of the children, but just taking them to play for a while. But from the point of view of the British elderly: According to the standard of &quot;Chinese grandma&quot;, she is not taking care of her children. She is clearly treating us as slave labor and even taking out my wallet. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, if the elderly look at the lives of their children: it is true that they are busy at work, but their children spend a lot of time playing outside and at home, and they can spend hours watching short videos. &quot;Chinese grandmas&quot; cannot be the hands-off shopkeepers like British grandmas, but they can let go of their children appropriately and send them away for a few years but not for a lifetime. This is beneficial to the personality growth and responsibility of one&#39;s son, daughter, daughter-in-law, son-in-law and grandchildren. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Old parents and children should understand that it is a matter of affection, not obligation, for the elderly to help take care of their children. Even if the love is deep, it should be stopped in moderation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 09 Oct 2023 19:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[记汉学家叶果夫]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258170]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-09 18:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/06/NKdIy3ol8Ge1jnlPZgoynhIMn5hqbD0hIy7QTvqc.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;896&quot; height=&quot;722&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/06/NKdIy3ol8Ge1jnlPZgoynhIMn5hqbD 0hIy7QTvqc. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253111&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In 2012, the authors of this article, Zhang Fusheng and Ye Guofu (pictured left), were published in People&#39;s Literature Publishing House Group photo in the company&#39;s office. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo provided by the author)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Russian sinologist Yegov (Игорь Aлександрович Егоров) passed away. He was one year younger than me. He was born in 1953 and left before he was seventy. According to our Chinese concept, it was a bit early. Maybe he had a bad life and stayed up late for a long time to translate, which damaged his health. My friend Mr. Liu Xianping from the Writers Association told me that he suffers from diabetes, which is so severe that he is about to have his limbs amputated. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the history of Sino-Russian cultural exchanges, Yegov can be regarded as a very contributory figure. First, as the Chinese editor of the Soviet State Literature Publishing House, he devoted great efforts to introducing Chinese literature to the Soviet Union and later to Russia for decades. Secondly, as a Russian sinologist, he translated the works of some writers during the May 4th Movement period such as Mao Dun. Later, he focused mainly on contemporary Chinese literature. The writers he translated included Su Tong, Yu Hua, Mo Yan, Bi Feiyu, etc. He has also translated some English works, but, in his own words, it is to earn royalties and support the Chinese literature he loves to translate. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For me, Yegov is my colleague in work. In terms of business, we can provide each other with practical and useful help and solve problems on the manuscript. At the same time, we are also friends who can open our hearts and exchange ideas, even though our views are sometimes inconsistent or even diametrically opposed on certain issues. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/06/FRX7dNtX47uH6giJM1SY6JrX5OfBBtjIW5eTIhRk.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;646&quot; height= &quot;944&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/06/FRX7dNtX47uH6giJM1SY6JrX5OfBBtjIW5eTIhRk.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253112&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Photo taken during Ye Guofu&#39;s first visit to Beijing in the 1990s. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo provided by the author)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Ten Days in Beijing&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Ye Guo and I The first time I met my husband was in March 1990. As the Chinese editor of the Leningrad branch of the Soviet State Literature Publishing House, he came to visit the People’s Literature Publishing House where I worked. At that time, Sino-Soviet relations had just begun to normalize. I remember that after the &quot;Selected Novels of Rasputin&quot; that I edited was published in 1982, I gave the author several donated books at the request of the Soviet Embassy. I sent the gift letter to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs as required, and they handed it over to the Soviet Embassy. In 2006, Rasputin came to Beijing Foreign Studies University for a meeting. He told me that he had only heard that a collection of his novels had been published in China, but he had never seen it. When Sholokhov passed away in 1984, researcher Sun Meiling of the Institute of Foreign Languages ​​and Literatures of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences wrote a short message, but there was no place to publish it. The same is true in the publishing industry. It was not until 1986 and 1987 that the leaders of the Soviet State Literature Publishing House and the People&#39;s Literature Publishing House realized mutual visits. In 1989, when our older generation editors Sun Shengwu, Jiang Lu, Xu Leiran, Chen Siyong, and Lu Yongfu visited the Soviet Union, they also visited their publishing house. This time they came to visit for ten days. The formal talks were translated by old comrade Mr. Cheng Wen. I was only responsible for accompanying them on sightseeing and shopping, so everyone was relatively relaxed and casual, talking and laughing. I no longer went to the Soviet Union in the early 1980s. That kind of nervousness at the embassy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Four editors came to this visit from the Soviet State Literature Publishing House: Director of the Foreign Literature Editorial Office Klimova, English editor; Chinese editor Yaroslavsky, an old comrade who is over 60 years old , has translated many Chinese classical literary works, and he translated the poems in the Russian version of &quot;Jin Ping Mei&quot;; and Yura Ilyashin, a young Chinese editor who came to China in 1984 as a reporter for the TASS News Agency and reformed After the opening up, he set up a company in China and published the newspaper &quot;Hand to Hand&quot;. These three people are all from the Moscow headquarters, while Yegov is from the Leningrad branch, and his name on his business card is the director of the editorial office. It seemed that he was not very familiar with the three people at the head office, so I took more care of him and spent a longer time chatting with him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During the conversation, I learned that Yegov, Yura and I both started learning each other&#39;s language in the early 1970s, shortly after the &quot;Zhenbao Island Incident&quot;. The purpose is self-evident and everyone knows it well. I told Ye Guofu that in 1969 I was an educated youth, and the Heilongjiang Production and Construction Corps station where I was located was only 95 kilometers away from Zhenbao Island. His eyes widened in surprise. I continued to tell him: Back then, there was an old high school senior in the company who taught everyone how to speak Russian every morning. I remember the first sentence I learned was: &quot;Raise your hands!&quot; He was startled at first, and was stunned for a moment, but he immediately became alert. Di replied in Chinese: &quot;Hand in the gun and not kill!&quot; We both laughed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another reason why Yegov and I had more contact during those ten days was that our speaking skills were pretty much the same. Yura was stationed in Beijing in 1984 when he was a reporter. I met him at the embassy. His listening and speaking abilities were better than ours. I talked with Yegov. He rushed to speak Chinese and I rushed to speak Russian. He only spoke his own language when he really didn&#39;t understand. It seemed that he was afraid of losing the opportunity to exercise and suffer a disadvantage. Yegov is a shy man. He blushes when seeing our old comrades. He speaks softly and has an elegant manner. He is very Leningrader and not as flamboyant as a Muscovite. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When they came, they were very interested in shopping, but shopping is my weakness. Every day after get off work, I would memorize Russian words that I might need the next day until late at night. Despite careful preparation, there were still many troubles. One morning, the four of them said seriously that they wanted to buy a must-buy food entrusted by a friend. It was round and colorful in shape and would grow bigger when fried in oil. Yaroslavsky also ridiculously made a sudden explosion with his hands, and made a &quot;pop&quot; sound from his mouth at the same time. The more vividly they described it, the richer my imagination became. I couldn&#39;t figure it out, so I had to lead them into the Dongdan Vegetable Market. We divided the troops into four groups, each of them holding an aisle, and searched carefully. After a while, Klimova&#39;s cry of surprise came. I went over to take a look and it turned out to be shrimp crackers. In order to avoid such trouble and lively atmosphere, I invited Mr. Gao Mang when I visited the Great Wall. He spoke very well. The four guests were extremely excited to see Gao Mang, as if meeting old friends in a foreign land, and they poured out all the words they had been holding in their hearts for several days. Yegov told me that Mr. Gao Mang was very famous in the Soviet Union. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The main result of their visit was to confirm the publishing plans of both parties in the next three years: Su Fang published &quot;Nie Haihua&quot;, &quot;Selected Poems of the Song Dynasty&quot;, &quot;Dream of Red Mansions&quot; and selected works by Guo Moruo, Lao She and Mao Dun; our publisher Published several volumes of &quot;Collected Works of Tolstoy&quot;, &quot;Collected Works of Pushkin&quot;, &quot;Selected Works of Turgenev&quot; and an &quot;Encyclopedic Dictionary of Literature&quot;. The most important thing is that the two publishing houses will each publish a collection of contemporary novels from the other, and the selections will be recommended by the other. The People&#39;s Literature Publishing House completed this project in the second year, but the Soviet State Literature Publishing House failed to publish it until it was disbanded. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;My personal gain is that my hearing has improved. They tell Soviet jokes every day, and sometimes I can’t believe my ears. In my impression, Yegov didn&#39;t say a word, and always maintained a gentlemanly attitude, as if he was listening. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/06/XxLnwV880wUjnjlmhS6tWDYQLFbVcyMwEE1N951f.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1029&quot; height= &quot;750&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/06/XxLnwV880wUjnjlmhS6tWDYQLFbVcyMwEE1N951f.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253114&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Yegov and the author of this article in front of the People&#39;s Literature Publishing House. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo provided by the author)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Three-month internship&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;1991 In May, I was dispatched by the Press and Publication Administration to work as an intern editor at the Soviet State Literary Publishing House. Klimova and Yura Ilyashin, who had just visited our publisher in 1990, were responsible for receiving me and were very warm to me. They also held a welcome meeting for the external editors&#39; office, met with their leaders at all levels, and visited their publishing house. , they treat me like a newly assigned colleague. By the way, this publishing house, especially the configuration of language staff in the foreign literature editing room, is very similar to our publishing house, except that there are more editors in the Indian language group. After I came back and talked about this situation, President Chen Wanchun said: It should be said that we are just like them. President Feng Xuefeng visited this publishing house in 1951, and our publishing house adopted the configuration of their publishing houses when it was first established. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On June 19, according to their arrangements, we arrived in Leningrad. As the head of the branch, Yegov received us and accompanied us on literary sightseeing every day - many writers in the history of literature have left their footprints in Leningrad. Yegov is a native of Leningrad, and he also knows many stories about the corners. . After visiting Tsarskoye Selo on June 24, while resting on the lawn in front of the square, Yegov and I had a debate about the October Revolution and socialism. We spoke Russian for a while and Chinese for a while. The accompanying staff laughed. . Yegov told me some social situations, which surprised me. When I was eating in the cafeteria of the Moscow headquarters, I heard someone say that I thought it was because of my poor hearing and I didn&#39;t understand, but I always felt that something happened. I asked Yura, and his answer was vague and obviously prevaricating, unlike Yegov&#39;s straightforwardness. At that time, the Soviet Union was experiencing painful struggles before its death. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On August 16, 1991, we ended our three-month internship in the Soviet Union and returned to Beijing. Four days later, the &quot;8·19&quot; incident that shocked the world occurred in Moscow&#39;s Red Square. The Soviet Union collapsed on December 25 of the same year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/06/u4OebnAlHlHNyPKHIOtGbGBubmFSfLht7XayGjrl.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;803&quot; height= &quot;574&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/06/u4OebnAlHlHNyPKHIOtGbGBubmFSfLht7XayGjrl.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253110&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Photographed in Yegov&#39;s office in 1992. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo provided by the author)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;One year of further study&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;November 1992 In August, I returned to Leningrad again, this time being sent by the State Education Commission to study for a year. At this time, Leningrad was being renamed St. Petersburg. The first sign to be replaced was the Leningrad Railway Station sign. I specially rushed to watch it. Looking at the slowly falling &quot;Leningrad&quot; sign, I felt extremely complicated. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before I settled down at Leningrad University, Yegov came to see me. Seeing that I was living in a crowded four-person room, he was a little embarrassed, as if he had made such a bad arrangement for me. But within a few days, I was transferred to a single room. One day in the lobby on the first floor, the dormitory administrator stopped me and insisted on chatting with me. He first introduced himself: a member of the Soviet Communist Party and one of the first pilots after the outbreak of the Great Patriotic War. However, he was quickly shot down and transferred to the hospital for treatment. When he recovered and was ready to return to the sky, the war ended. Then he said that he respected me very much and knew that I had introduced many Russian writers to China. He even knew that I had translated the works of Semyonov. This writer was well-known in the Soviet Union and had written works about the Soviet-German spy war. After questioning me carefully, I found out that it was Yegov who told him so that he could change me to a better room. This veteran administrator was cunning, selfish, and did some ridiculous things, but he gave me a lot of help during my year of studying abroad. I am very grateful to him, and even more grateful to Yegov. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The publishing house where Yegov worked was located in the most beautiful and lively area on Nevsky Prospekt, on the top floor of the St. Petersburg Bookstore. This building, built in the 18th century, is opposite the famous Kazan Church, so it welcomes a large number of tourists from all over the world every day. As one of the largest bookstores in Europe, St. Petersburg Bookstore not only sells the latest books in Russia and various foreign publications, but also a variety of cultural supplies and souvenirs. It also often holds various book fairs, book clubs, new book launches and author signings. Book signing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Leningrad University where I have classes every day is right by the Neva River. I can walk across the bridge to Nevsky Prospekt. If I take the subway, it is just one stop away, so I often come to this bookstore. As a publisher, I like it here. Besides, Yegov is upstairs. When you are tired, you can go to his office to sit, drink hot water and smoke a cigarette. There are benches in the corridor where you can lie down. Most of the people in their editorial office knew me, and they entertained me when Yegov was away. Ye Guofu was obsessed with translation at that time and always looked forward to my going. Sometimes he knew that I had gone to the bookstore but not upstairs, and he still didn&#39;t understand. Almost every time he went, he would take out a few pages of paper prepared in advance, with problems to be solved written on them. There was a space after each question for me to write my opinion, and I just had to rewrite it into sentences he could understand. Ye Guofu is a very smart man. This way, we can avoid misunderstandings due to oral expressions and leave the words in black and white for him to ponder carefully. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I remember that I helped him do one thing, which was the project signed by the two publishers in 1990 - each other published a collection of contemporary novels from each other, and the task of the Russian version of the collection of contemporary Chinese novels was handed over to him. Yegov. At that time, the Chinese manuscripts recommended by the Chinese side were piled on his desk. According to the editing style, each writer had a biography. These biographies were all handwritten by the writers themselves, with different number of words and different styles and formats. Some even included the words &quot;Cultural Revolution&quot;. &quot;The allegro lyrics created by Zhongzai&#39;s publicity team were also included. Lao Ye was confused and asked me for help with a grimace. I rewrote it into a hundred words. Lao Ye understood and was very grateful. It took me some time and effort so I remember. Ye Guofu mentioned this matter several times when he came to Beijing and felt sorry for me because the book was not published in the end. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At that time, he had finished translating Su Tong&#39;s &quot;Wives and Concubines&quot; and asked me to &quot;correct&quot; him. I have not read this novel, but I read it carefully in order to revise Yegov&#39;s translation. Regarding the serious errors in his translation, I only corrected them without explaining them. Instead, I raised objections to his criteria for selecting the translation. I said to him: What the author describes is a very special kind of abnormal life in China and does not have universal typical significance. Furthermore, after being translated into another language, a lot of essence has been lost, which does not reflect the level of contemporary Chinese literary creation. I suggested that he translate &quot;There&#39;s a Snowstorm Tonight&quot; by Liang Xiaosheng. It&#39;s on the recommendation list and I&#39;ve read it. It&#39;s very good. But he said: The content described in this novel is very similar to Khrushchev&#39;s Siberian reclamation, and Russian readers will not like it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yegov worked very hard on translation at that time. In addition to achieving his own lofty goals, there was also a very practical reason. In St. Petersburg in 1993, life was difficult for ordinary people. My teacher told me that sometimes wages are not paid on time. When you get rubles, you have to change them into dollars immediately, and then into rubles when you use them. When we first went there, it seemed that one dollar was exchanged for 300 rubles, and a month later it was exchanged for 400. Half a year later, when I went to Moscow University, I actually got 1,300 rubles in the Vietnamese dormitory. Mr. Qi Yide, who translated &quot;Sanyan Erpai&quot;, was a famous sinologist of the older generation. She called one night and said she had not bought any bread. I would take a short detour to school and pass by her house. Sometimes I would buy some bread or something, hang it on her doorknob, and call her to let her know. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Two Unforgettable Things&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Ye Guofu earned extra money by translating to supplement his family income. From my contact with him, I deeply felt that he was a very family-oriented man who treated his wife and children very much like a good Chinese man. He is also sincere and enthusiastic in helping people, and will go all out when you need him. On August 14, 1993, I received a long-distance call from China from Li Yuxia, director of the foreign literature editorial office of our newspaper. She asked me to immediately find a solution to the problem of &quot;Destruction&quot;, &quot;Young Guards&quot; and &quot;Quiet Don&quot;. There is a copyright issue because there are domestic publishers who took action before us. From the tone of her voice and the speed of her speech, I could tell that the situation was critical. These three books are the standing books of our society, especially the latter two. They have been reprinted every year since the early 1980s. As soon as we joined the Berne Convention, publishers came to snatch us up. As the editor in charge of these three books, I was naturally impatient. I found Yegov on the same day and explained the situation to him. The next day he helped me contact Sholokhov’s copyright heir, his daughter Svetlana. She told me that she had indeed received an application from a Chinese publisher, but had not signed it yet. She also told me that Sholokhov once had the opportunity to visit China, but it was a pity that he did not make the trip. Svetlana promised that the copyright would be given to People&#39;s Literature Publishing House. From her words, I felt that Yegov had talked to her beforehand, and she knew everything, so I didn’t need to waste any words. Two days later, I went to the Moscow Literary Publishing House. Yura helped me contact Fadeev’s widow. Her answer reassured me: “My sample books are all published by the People’s Literature Publishing House. Of course, this book is also Published by you.&quot; The thing that made me panic was solved smoothly with the help of two friends. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is another thing that makes me very grateful to Yegov. In September 1993, my wife was coming to Leningrad to visit relatives. There were no mobile phones at that time, and it was difficult to make long-distance calls. Somehow, Ye Guov became the hub of communication between me and my wife, the &quot;mouthpiece&quot; for information, probably because there was a phone in his office that could make international long distance calls. He seemed to be an official at that time. I checked the diary from that year and found that Ye Guofu came to my dormitory five or six times that month. The last time was at eight o&#39;clock in the evening, telling my wife the time of departure from Beijing and arrival in Moscow. Why didn&#39;t you tell me over the phone? Maybe it was because I was afraid that I wouldn’t understand and misunderstood, so I talked about it in person and wrote it down on a piece of paper. It shows how serious and reliable he is. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A few days after his wife arrived, Yegov invited us to his home. He even picked us up at the subway station that day. In fact, I have been to his house many times and the route is very familiar to me. When he entered, his wife dressed up to welcome him very warmly and set a table full of delicious food. An interesting thing happened before dinner started. I was browsing his collection of books in Yegov&#39;s room. Yegov, who was originally translating for the host and guest, walked in quietly, patted my shoulder gently, and pointed outside. I looked over and saw two ladies sitting on the sofa who didn&#39;t understand each other&#39;s language at all. They were beaming and talking animatedly. Yegov and I looked at each other for a moment and almost laughed. We had a great time that day, and the two ladies hugged each other at the subway entrance before parting, like good sisters who have been friends for many years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/06/oQHaE8Mt6wDy1tGR95ozF8U59FdOQEjP97UhYA8M.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;908&quot; height= &quot;522&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/06/oQHaE8Mt6wDy1tGR95ozF8U59FdOQEjP97UhYA8M.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253113&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In 2012, Ye Guofu (second from left) and Mo Yan (third from left) met at the People&#39;s Literature Publishing House. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo provided by the author)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;See you again in twenty years&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; In the first few years after returning to China, I still communicated with Ye Guofu and asked someone to take care of me. Later, we lost contact. Around 2000, someone told me that the original Soviet State Literature Publishing House was dissolved and no longer existed. Until 2012, a colleague told me that Ye Guofu came to me online and said that he would come to Beijing to hold an international seminar for sinologists. Twenty years later, we met at the hotel where he was staying. He held my hand and said that I have not aged, and I held his hand and said that he still looks the same. We all know we are telling lies. We resumed our conversation the next day in my office. I showed him the Russian literary works I had edited and published over the past 20 years, and he told me about his journey in the past 20 years and the works he had translated. He said that he had been reading Mo Yan&#39;s novels for several years, found a feeling for them, and started translating them. When talking about his experience, he also said, like some people, that Mo Yan&#39;s novels were influenced by Western &quot;magic realism&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I told him that most Chinese writers create their own works. As far as the writers I have read, I don’t think any of them have been influenced by foreign writers. If we talk about influence, it is also the region where they were born and their innate personal personalities. These two factors determine their storytelling methods and characteristics. For example, if I ask Mo Yan, he is actually telling the story of the land and water where he was raised in Gaomi, Shandong Province, using his unique storytelling method, just like his fellow Shandong fellow Pu Songling used his method to tell the story of &quot;Liao Zhai Zhi&quot;. &quot;different&quot; same. Their place in Shandong has this long literary tradition and is rich in this kind of literature. Yegov seems to understand vaguely, but I feel that our conversation today seems to be a continuation of the conversation in Leningrad about the criteria for selecting translation works. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I showed him the contemporary Russian literary works published by our agency in the past ten years, including more than a dozen novels and four short story collections, involving more than 70 writers, including those who became famous in the 1950s. There are new works by the old writer Graning, works by the world-famous Rasputin in the 1960s, and award-winning young writers in the 1980s and 1990s. He was very surprised when he saw it. The translated works of Russian contemporary literature published by our publishing house were as good as the translated works of Chinese contemporary literature published in Russia. Probably touching his sadness, he vomited his bitterness to me, saying how difficult it is to publish a Chinese literary work in Russia, not to mention that China has a huge readership of Russian literature, and all the publishing houses in Russia are now He founded a private publishing house and only focused on profits...&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On August 21, 2012, Ye Guofu called and told him that he would meet with Mr. Mo Yan tomorrow and asked me to attend. The location could be in my office. Of course I agree. Mr. Mo Yan came earlier the next day. He gave me two of his books, and I gave me a set of &quot;The Quiet Don River&quot; that I edited. Mr. Mo Yan is a very down-to-earth, sincere and natural person. He does not seem like the kind of person who hides his hidden agenda. In fact, I met him, I remember it was at the Strindberg Seminar at Peking University, and he even gave a speech. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I chatted with Mr. Mo Yan for a while, and then Ye Guofu came. The two of them didn&#39;t seem to know each other very well, and they were a little reserved at first. Yegov was not a good talker. Fortunately, I soon let go. Mr. Mo Yan is still very good at leading the topic and livening up the atmosphere. At that time, I thought Mo Yan was quite eloquent and thought he could tell stories. I heard Mr. Feng Jicai tell a story. It was when he was revising a manuscript at the People&#39;s Literature Publishing House. At that time, he asked to turn off the lights, saying that it would be more effective. So I think most writers have the talent to tell stories. The topic that day basically revolved around Mr. Mo Yan’s creations. The president, Comrade Guan Shiguang, came for more than half an hour. Yegov didn&#39;t talk much. He talked about Chinese literature, especially the &quot;experience&quot; of contemporary Chinese literature in Russia, and how difficult it was to publish his translation of Mo Yan&#39;s works... I also know something about this situation. I participated in several book fairs and book ordering events in Moscow and Leningrad. I never saw a single Chinese literary work, but occasionally came across one or two books with a touch of &quot;Kung Fu&quot;. . By the end of the day, everyone was still chatting happily. I checked the diary of that day: &quot;We chatted from 2 pm to 6 pm, and then had dinner at Jiuyefu Restaurant opposite the publishing house until 8:30.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The day before returning to China, we went together During dinner, Ye Guofu told me that Mr. Liu Zhenyun also wanted to translate a few of his works and asked me to express my opinion. I said: &quot;You know, there is an old saying in China: The writing is like the person. Mo Yan is from Shandong, his writing is straightforward, and he tells stories. Liu Zhenyun is from Henan, his writing is melodramatic, and he has the unique humor of Henan people. His works are exquisite It is taste, and taste is difficult to translate. For example, there is a sentence in Lu Xun&#39;s &quot;The Story in the Hair&quot;: &quot;Most of the families lazily walked out a citizen.&quot; The word &quot;pace&quot; and &quot;国&quot; in it have been translated , is boring. Another example is your translation of &quot;Big Breasts, Wide Butts&quot;. If a Russian writer who has never seen the original work is translated into Chinese based on your translation, it will probably be translated into &quot;Big Breasts, Wide Butts&quot;. &quot;, what&#39;s the taste?&quot; I suddenly realized something was wrong and couldn&#39;t help laughing. Ye Guofu seemed to have realized something, and he laughed out loud. I told him again that when I was an intern at the Moscow Literary Publishing House in 1991, they asked me many questions about the translation of Lao She&#39;s works and &quot;Dream of Red Mansions&quot;, mostly about the &quot;meaning&quot; behind the words. I also told him about the &quot;Water Margin&quot; (Russian-Chinese version of the Greater China Library), which I was responsible for publishing. I carefully compared the problems found in Luo Gaoshou&#39;s translation, and wanted to further prove that what is lost when the two languages ​​are exchanged is the essence. Mainly This is because some words and expressions in Chinese are not found in Russian. Choose carefully. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;The last meeting&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The last time I met Yegov was on August 28, 2014, at the &quot;Chinese-Russian Literature Translation&quot; held at the Russian Embassy Publishing Project&quot; meeting. There were a lot of people that day, and Yegov suddenly dragged the Russian writer Yesin to me, jokingly saying that he wanted to go through the back door: Yesin wanted his &quot;Death of Giants&quot; to be published by the People&#39;s Literature Publishing House. Yesin is a famous Russian writer and the dean of the Gorky Academy of Literature, and this novel is among the books recommended by Russia. So I obtained the consent of Liu Guohui, the leader of the society who came to the meeting with me, and called Mr. Liu Xianping from the Writers Association and the copyright association on the spot. Mr. Zhang Hongbo, the director-general and the person in charge of the &quot;Mutual Translation Project&quot; held a small meeting with Ye Xin and Ye Guofu and decided that &quot;Death of Giants&quot; would be published by our publisher and translated by Liu Xianping. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Probably we are not the only publishing house that works on-site like ours. The venue was always noisy, and Yegov and I never had time to talk alone. When it was about to end, Ye Guofu hurriedly pulled me to a quiet corner and told me excitedly that the Chinese Writers Association gave him a large sum of money, which was enough for him to focus on translation in a few years without having to worry about making a living. . Looking at his slightly moist eyes, I was also very happy. I knew that his life had not been easy over the years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Rest in peace, Igor. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is his nickname, and he likes me to call him that. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 09 Oct 2023 18:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[偷餐者绑天桥示众？店家应该如此喝阻小偷吗？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258289]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-09 17:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;According to the Southern Metropolis Daily, a store in Mixue Bingcheng, Guangzhou issued a handwritten warning for stealing food, saying that those who steal food will be required to He was &quot;tied to a flyover and paraded in public for 8 hours&quot;, sparking heated discussions.

They said in the letter that they would do their best to take responsibility, fully cooperate with the police and other departments to find out the truth, and do their best to mitigate the impact of the incident. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the same day, the Thai government announced a compensation plan. Suthawan, Thailand’s Minister of Tourism and Sports, said that Thailand will provide 6.2 million baht (approximately RMB 1.23 million) in compensation for each victim. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Three days ago, on October 3, just a week after Thailand implemented a visa-free policy for Chinese tourists, a series of piercing gunshots rang out in the Siam Paragon shopping mall, and panicked crowds ran in all directions. The tragic shooting resulted in 2 deaths and 5 injuries. The Chinese victim was only 34 years old. At the time of the incident, she was traveling in Thailand with her 5-year-old twin daughters, and they originally planned to take a flight back to China early in the morning on October 4. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What is surprising is that the perpetrator of the shooting was a boy who had just turned 14 years old. He is accused of suffering from mental illness and has been sent to a mental hospital in Bangkok for evaluation of his mental condition. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The sudden shooting not only made tourists in Thailand uneasy, but also worried Thailand, which is eager to revive the tourism industry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Jidi, chairman of the Thailand Tourism Marketing Association, told Thailand&#39;s &quot;Public Opinion&quot; that due to the vicious shooting at Siam Paragon, the number of foreign tourists to Thailand may decrease by 1 million in the fourth quarter of 2023. Revenue shrank by 50 billion baht (approximately RMB 10 billion). &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;40 gunshots&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;If it weren’t for this shooting tragedy, Li Qian’s family could have spent a happy holiday in Thailand. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At noon on October 3, 2023, Li Qian and his wife arrived in Bangkok by plane with their three-year-old child. After checking in at Chatrium Hotel, they were picked up directly from the hotel at around 4 p.m. The shuttle bus arrives at Siam Paragon. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Paragon is located in Siam Square in the heart of Bangkok. It is the most famous luxury shopping mall in Bangkok and was once rated as the most photographed place in the world by Instagram. Li Qian decided to make the first stop of her trip to Thailand here, but what she didn&#39;t expect was that she would be greeted by continuous gunshots. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“As soon as I got to the second floor, I heard a loud bang. I immediately had a bad premonition. Before I could react, there were two more bangs and bangs in succession, and then... I heard screams from downstairs, and people started to run away. My husband rushed to the third floor with the child in his arms, and then there were several gunshots. I was so scared that my legs were weak, and I felt that bullets were behind me. He was about to be hit at any time.&quot; Li Qian recalled to Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At 3:35 pm on October 3, the assailant took the light rail and entered Siam Paragon. Surveillance video showed that five minutes later, he walked into the bathroom on the M floor carrying a schoolbag containing bullets. At 4:10, gunshots were first heard in the bathroom. Immediately afterwards, a long-haired man wearing a black shirt and a baseball cap with an American flag printed on his head came out and started shooting at the crowd. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When the gunfire rang out, Huahua was in the aisle separated from the bathroom where the incident occurred, waiting for friends who were shopping at the Chanel store. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“I didn’t know the murderer was next to us at the time. I just heard the gunshots very clearly.” Huahua told Southern Weekend reporters, “I thought it was a robbery of a luxury store at first. It was nothing special. It wasn’t until we later watched the news and discovered he was right next to us that we started to feel a little scared.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At 4:25, the assailant came to the second floor and continued shooting. Minutes later, he took the escalator to the third floor and continued shooting. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Subsequently, the gunman called the Thai police phone number to surrender, and clearly told the police his location and specific clothing. At 5:10, he was arrested in a home furnishing store on the third floor. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Bangkok Post&quot; quoted a source familiar with the investigation as saying that before his arrest, the suspect fired about 40 shots in the mall, and a total of 11 shots were found on the dead and injured. bullet. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Despite the frightening moment, Li Qian and others were at least lucky enough to return home safely. However, a Chinese tourist and a Burmese migrant worker in Thailand left their lives in Thailand. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to reports from the Thai police, the shooting at Siam Paragon resulted in 2 deaths and 5 injuries, and the initiator was a 14-year-old boy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to Thailand&#39;s MGR Online news network, the suspect in the shooting incident was born in 2009 and just turned 14 years old on September 21. He is the eldest son in the family. His family is very wealthy, and his father works in a well-known university. The teenager studied in a private school with a tuition fee of hundreds of thousands of baht a year. While at school, he won the Outstanding Student Award for the 2017 academic year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As Bangkok’s top luxury shopping mall, Siam Paragon claims to have strict security measures. However, the murderer successfully entered with a gun. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tosak, the director of the Thai National Police, explained in an interview that because the gun involved was modified into a plastic structure, it was not discovered in time, and the security of the mall was not as constant as at the airport. They are very strict, with people coming in and out all the time, and it is difficult for the testing equipment to conduct precise inspections on everyone. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, many people involved in the shooting recalled to Southern Weekend reporters that Siam Paragon had no security measures and only two or three security guards were on duty at the door. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the shooting, just a few hours after arriving in Thailand, Li Qian changed her ticket to return to China the next day. &quot;I didn&#39;t really feel safe until the moment the plane landed. From a person watching the news to a person in the news, everything was so unreal.&quot; Li Qian said that now she hears the gunshots in the video, she is still instantly taken away. Pull back to the scene of the shooting. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hua Hua and her friends continued to spend a day shopping in Thailand with fear, but they did not dare to go shopping in Siam again. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Mental problems? &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Paragon surveillance video showed that when he was arrested, the 14-year-old suspect looked dull, his eyes flashed, and he kept mumbling to himself. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tosak said the teenager had received treatment at Rajavithi Hospital for mental health problems in the past, but did not take his medication on the day of the incident. &quot;He felt like someone was telling him to shoot this or that person, as if there was another &#39;him&#39; inside his body.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another netizen who often plays games online with the assailant teenager said, &quot; He often behaves emotionally, and it is obvious that he has a heavy psychological burden.&quot; The netizen also revealed that the young man had mentioned that he had schizophrenia symptoms, but he did not take medication to control it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the boy&#39;s parents said that their son was addicted to shooting games, but he had never had any history of mental illness. In an interview with Thai TV station One News31, his mother said she suspected that her child liked to use shooting to vent his emotions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At present, the young man who committed the crime has been sent to Bangkok Mental Hospital for detention and treatment. Experts from the hospital will evaluate whether he suffers from mental illness. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Washin, a lawyer at Thailand&#39;s Mandarin Law Firm, estimates that the results of the mental evaluation will be issued within two or three weeks, and the subsequent inspection report will be handed over to the relevant departments within a month. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Based on reports from Thai media, the shooting was not a whim of the teenager, but was well prepared in advance. The Thai news website The Thaiger bluntly called the shooting a &quot;premeditated murder.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the &quot;Bangkok Post&quot; report, the teenager originally planned to buy a real gun online, but because the price was too high, he then borrowed money through an online lending platform and settled for 16,000 baht (approximately RMB 3164) purchased a modified blank gun. In the teenager&#39;s home, the police also found two guns and a large amount of ammunition. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before the incident, the teenager had invited friends with whom he was practicing shooting to go to Siam Paragon. Until the moment he arrived at the mall, he had a video call with his friends, saying that he was &quot;going to shoot.&quot; . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the suspect was arrested, the police found videos from his mobile phone of him practicing with live ammunition at a shooting range, including clips of changing ammunition and shooting targets. Some netizens also posted that they had met the assailant by chance at the &quot;Bangkok Shooting Club&quot; before, and that he was dressed exactly the same as on the day of the attack. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is still unknown why the former outstanding student turned into a gun-wielding killer. However, Thailand&#39;s Public Opinion reported that after preliminary investigation, the police found that the 14-year-old boy who killed someone with a gun at Siam Paragon faced academic difficulties and his academic performance was poor, but his parents forced him to improve his academic performance. There is chat evidence showing that after the suspected teenager was urged by his parents to improve his academic performance, he instead sent a video of himself shooting at the shooting range and said, &quot;I want to go here.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 4, the head of the Kyoto Police Station in Bangkok, Thailand, stated that the police filed five preliminary charges against the 14-year-old suspect responsible for the shooting, including intentional homicide, murder, illegal possession of a gun, and unauthorized possession of a gun. Carrying firearms into public places with permission and shooting in public places without permission. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;In Thailand, shootings that cause death can be punished with the death penalty, life imprisonment, or 15 to 20 years in prison. However, because Thailand rarely carries out the death penalty, the maximum penalty is generally only life imprisonment.&quot; Waxin analysis , &quot;Now that the suspect is only 14 years old, he will most likely be sentenced to 15-20 years in prison. But at the same time, the court may take measures such as juvenile detention, mental hospital imprisonment, etc. to replace prison time.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Mental illness cannot be a reason for acquittal, but if it is ultimately determined that there is a mental illness, the court may reduce the sentence based on his relevant medical history, and may ultimately be sentenced to 10-15 years in prison, or even a sentence of no more than Possibility in 10 years,&quot; Vaxin added. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Belated gun control&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;This is not the first mass shooting in Thailand. In the past three years, Thailand has suffered three consecutive shooting massacres. The Siam Paragon shooting happened on the first anniversary of the nursery massacre. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 6, 2022, a former police officer broke into a nursery with a gun and a knife in Utai Sawang Town, Nongmo Lamphu Province, northeastern Thailand, killing 38 people, 24 of whom were children. . The murderer returned home afterwards, killed his wife and children and committed suicide. Thailand’s Public Broadcasting and Television reported that this was the first large-scale terrorist attack targeting children’s places in Thailand’s history. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Previously in February 2020, a Thai soldier went on a killing spree with a gun in a shopping mall in the northeastern city of Nakhon Ratchasima, killing 29 people and injuring 57 others. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Amnesty International human rights researcher and Thai Tatya Karonwang pointed out that given the occurrence of three similar incidents in recent years, Thai society is reminded that this may not be just an isolated unfortunate incident and the country needs to be re-evaluated. Is gun violence a systemic problem? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Until the shooting, Huahua did not know that it was legal to hold a gun in Thailand, and he never thought that such a thing would happen to him. But in fact, Thailand has one of the highest rates of gun ownership and gun-related deaths in Asia. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A study conducted in 2017 by the &quot;Small Arms Survey&quot;, a research institute in Geneva, Switzerland, showed that Thailand&#39;s total population is about 70 million, but the number of guns it holds is as many as 10.34 million, of which only 10.34 million are legally registered. About 6.2 million. Investigators estimate that 15 out of every 100 people in Thailand own guns, ranking first in ASEAN and second in Asia after Pakistan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to data released by the US think tank &quot;World Population Review&quot; in 2022, Thailand has 3.91 gun deaths per 100,000 people, ranking second among ASEAN countries, second only to the Philippines. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for gun control, Thailand’s relevant laws are not strict. &quot;Thai citizens who are over 20 years old need to undergo strict background checks before they can legally hold guns. They are not allowed to hold guns in public and can only be used for specific purposes such as self-defense and hunting. At the same time, citizens must put gun shells, springs Store them separately from bullets and other accessories and cannot be placed in the same place.&quot; Vaxin pointed out. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But in addition to legal gun ownership, there are still a large number of imported guns and imitation weapons that can be freely traded on the black market and the Internet. Wa Xin said that similar black guns are common in Thailand. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Investigation data from the Thai Police General Administration in 2019 showed that there were more than 31,400 gun-related cases in Thailand that year, of which more than 24,300 cases involved unregistered illegal guns, accounting for 10% of the cases. 77.5% of the total. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Many illegal firearms are smuggled into Thailand, and Internet sales are exacerbating this trend.” Krisanaporn, a criminologist at Thailand’s Rangsit University, told AFP, “However, only a few police officers have the online Knowledge, ability and experience in tracking the gun market.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the shooting tragedy, the Thai police acted vigorously and arrested 6 suspects for selling guns and ammunition to the teenager who committed the crime. At the same time, Thai officials have made it clear that they will strengthen gun control measures and close legal loopholes in online gun sales. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 5, Thailand’s Ministry of Interior held a meeting and approved 13 gun control measures, including strengthening the registration and management of firearms, stopping the issuance of firearms business licenses and carry-on firearms permits, and requiring gun owners to Short-term and long-term gun control measures include providing medical certification of mental health conditions, cracking down on illegal weapons trading websites, and redefining imitation guns. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, similar measures are just bringing up old matters again. After the tragedy of the nursery massacre in 2022, the lower house of the Thai Parliament stated that it would explore short-term and long-term measures for gun control and response to gun violence. However, until the general election in May 2023, the gun amnesty bill drafted by the previous government failed to pass parliamentary review. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some experts are not optimistic about how effective the new gun control measures will be. A commentary article published on the American Diplomat website stated that short-term policy adjustments cannot fundamentally solve the problem of black market gun trading, and the Thai government must give up its laissez-faire mentality of tolerating the illegal economy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(Li Qian and Huahua are pseudonyms in the article)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>; &lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br >;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 09 Oct 2023 16:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[掏大钱才得见“优质异性”：“相亲顾问”套路深]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258208]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-09 15:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Because of hitting a wall in reality or the dating circle is too narrow and lacks &quot;dating resources&quot;, go to the dating website to try your luck , it is indeed the choice of some people, but what is the outcome? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A netizen’s complaint gives us a glimpse into the words and routines of “dating consultants”. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He once received a call from a blind date website, asking him to talk about their blind date services. The dating consultant asked him to find out that he was a manager of a private enterprise, with an annual income of 400,000+, and that he had a house, a car and no loans, so he recommended a dating service with a price of 70,000, and even said to him: For a high-income person like you, 70,000 is not enough. It&#39;s not a high price, but we can provide emotional services. Then he pulled up two resumes with specific information concealed from his mobile phone. Both of them had a photo of a beautiful woman. He told him that both beauties had paid membership fees of N million, and their requirements were very suitable for his situation. As long as Once he joins the association, he can immediately arrange to meet and get to know each other. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But his psychological price is less than 10,000. He said that 70,000 yuan was an unaffordable price for him. Seeing that he was about to get up and leave, the dating consultant said in a very disdainful tone, &quot;What we are talking about now is your life-long event. If you yourself feel that you are not worth tens of thousands of dollars, then there is nothing we can do.&quot; The dating consultant also emphasized that , &quot;Many of our members have paid membership fees of hundreds of thousands or hundreds of thousands a year, but I didn&#39;t mention it to you considering your income level.&quot; He replied, not thinking that his life event is not worth 70,000, but just I feel that this kind of service is not worth 70,000 yuan. As for hundreds of thousands or hundreds of thousands, only XX would spend such a big sum of money. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Two days later, the dating consultant called him and said in a familiar and friendly manner that if paying 70,000 at once was too much, the website could provide installment payments and discounts. He also recommended other packages, but he hung up the phone directly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Similar scenes have been exposed by the media for a long time: the target is locked in a room for two to three hours for brainwashing, and is required to pay tens of thousands of yuan in membership fees; after registration, harassment calls are received from various numbers Phone call; after registering, you were invited to go to the offline store, but after paying the money, your attitude was perfunctory. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This netizen said that in his opinion, spending tens of thousands of yuan to buy a blind date service is a bit ridiculous. It was not until he saw someone actually posting a blind date service bill of 32,000 yuan that he felt that he was short-sighted. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, it is not that he is short-sighted, but that in the face of the powerful words and targeted bombing sales of some dating websites, some people will eventually be unable to defeat him. In March 2022, The Paper reported that through phone calls and WeChat, a marriage agency claiming to be from the &quot;MarryU Club high-end membership club&quot; continued to promote &quot;high-end marriage consulting services&quot; to Ms. Guo in Beijing, and promised to be able to provide services during the service period. Help her find the right match. Ms. Guo came to an offline physical franchise store on the platform and signed a 480-day membership service contract and supplementary agreement worth nearly 170,000 yuan. It was agreed that a company in Hangzhou would entrust a consulting and management company in Beijing to perform contract services and promised to provide Ms. Guo with a customized version of &quot;marriage hunting services.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;News reports tell us that the lady’s 170,000 yuan was wasted. During the follow-up service process, Ms. Guo discovered that the identity of the men provided for appointments on the platform was questionable, and some had discrepancies in age and workplace information. Some did not even leave their WeChat or contact information after meeting. “Even if they were added, (the other party) would not No reaction.&quot; While the contract was in effect, Ms. Guo met her current husband in an accidental private social interaction, and the two received their marriage certificate in December 2021. After the marriage, Ms. Guo thought she could return a certain percentage of the service fee, but was rejected by the matchmaking agency on the grounds that she violated the contract by &quot;marrying a candidate who was not recommended by the agency.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If you think what happened to Ms. Guo is just an accident, you are totally wrong. Data show that in the first half of 2019, the Jucomplaint platform received a total of 1,686 valid complaints from consumers across the country regarding the dating and dating industry. In the current period, 993 complaints were confirmed to have been resolved, with a resolution rate of 58.9%. Judging from the types of complaints, they mainly include exaggerated service effects and difficulty in refunding. To put it bluntly, some dating platforms are playing tricks on you, and they don’t care about the wine but your wallet. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the folk, &quot;matchmaker&#39;s words&quot; have long been the driving force for young people to come together. Theoretically, a dating website is a &quot;virtual matchmaker&quot;, but in reality, this &quot;virtual matchmaker&quot; often shows characteristics that are contrary to the function of a matchmaker. The most important characteristic of a matchmaker is to use his sharp tongue to facilitate the marriage between a man and a woman as quickly as possible. However, some dating websites are just the opposite. Their core appeal is to try their best to sign a long-term contract. To this end, they delay and consume all kinds of things until the contract is due. Period, make a lot of money. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The purpose of paying a large membership fee is to find high-quality men and women, but a disturbing problem is that on some dating websites, there are really high-quality men and women waiting for you, and you only need to pay enough to find the right one. Object? In fact, you can know the answer just by looking at the logic lines. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In reality, high-quality men and women have long been robbed of their heads. Do they still need to go to a blind date platform? It is said that some platforms have a large number of high-quality men and women, and after paying the money, it is yours. Is this a joke? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When you pay a membership fee to a blind date website, you are essentially paying an agency fee. But many times, the agency fee is very strange. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the field of real estate, intermediaries still have &quot;business rules&quot;. They can only charge fees after the house sale is completed, so real estate agents try their best to bring both parties together to reach a deal. However, some dating websites induce eager men and women to spend their money and are irresponsible for the results. They can actually continue to have a prosperous business and have no worries about customer sources. Do they really benefit from the &quot;people are stupid and have more money&quot;? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many members of the dating platform spend tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands or even hundreds of thousands, which is really no less than the agency fee for buying a house - the &quot;bulk transactions&quot; displayed in this kind of marriage and love market are full of of fantasy and absurdity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some dating platforms engage in the practice of fabricating portraits, deceiving you, and cutting as many leeks as you can. They are despicable and shameless, but they always gain the upper hand with a series of misleading and risk-mitigating techniques. This makes many consumers miserable. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Those who frequently talk to you about money are not just scammers, but also people who engage in &quot;dating tricks&quot;. It is common sense to realize that it is unlikely that a dating website will have high-quality men and women, it is unlikely that you can get &quot;more&quot; by spending more money, and it is unlikely that you will be invincible with the &quot;guidance&quot; of a dating consultant. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Finding a partner “online” certainly has a certain effect – in fact, I have friends who found true love online, but do I have to find some “professional platform” to find a partner? not necessarily. The aforementioned Ms. Guo signed a contract but found the right person outside the platform. This &quot;accident&quot; that slapped the platform in the face fully demonstrates that hot life scenes are the &quot;incubation&quot; base for relationships. Sometimes, when you can&#39;t find a partner, it&#39;s not because you haven&#39;t entered the &quot;professional platform&quot;, but because your effective social circle is not large enough, or in other words, you are not deep enough in the ocean of life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If you really can&#39;t meet the right person on your own, then use your parents, relatives, friends, and colleagues to exert energy and accumulate opportunities, and at the same time try to expand your private social circle and personal media display circle to open up opportunities for yourself. The door to marriage and love is still a trustworthy path. At least, if you take this path, your wallet will not be hurt, your armor will be thrown away, and you will have nowhere to complain. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 09 Oct 2023 15:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[更能提供情绪价值？网购冲击下，实体店靠什么活下来]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258228]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-09 14:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;The rise of e-commerce platforms has had a big impact on offline shopping. Coupled with the increase in consumption in recent years, After downgrading, many users, including me, have to shop around online before placing an order, and even start shopping on some platforms that are famous for their low prices, and they still find it really delicious. With such an unstoppable consumer trend, I thought that physical stores would definitely not be able to open. However, after observing my parents’ consumption behavior, I understood how physical stores can maintain a competitive advantage. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;My hometown has a newly built self-built house with many rooms and toilets, so there is no one-time renovation. I took advantage of the e-commerce shopping festival to buy a bathroom cabinet for the restroom. This is the product I ordered after reading countless posts on how to choose bathroom ware online. After it was delivered to my hometown, I made an appointment with the installer, and nothing went wrong in the process. The only question came from my dad. In addition to expressing his dissatisfaction with the price, he also asked me a soul-searching question: &quot;Why don&#39;t you go to a store near home to buy it? I know you, it will be easier to repair in the future.&quot; I can&#39;t answer this question, because The reason for online shopping is to pursue cost-effectiveness, but my prices are uncompetitive in front of him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When I returned to my hometown, my dad couldn’t wait to take me to the bathroom they used and asked me to guess how much the bathroom cabinet in front of me cost. I said I couldn’t guess, “500 yuan!” With a proud look on his face, I could even see his inner monologue: &quot;See if I&#39;m very good. Online shopping is just a cloud!&quot; He explained to me: &quot;This is a sample from the boss&#39;s clearance, and I took it away. &quot;Of course I know that there is a difference between three-no products with nothing and brand-name products. The most direct reflection is the price, but the low price really shocked me. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Misfortune never comes singly. After I went home and used the newly installed bathroom cabinet several times, I found that the sink and water pipe connections were not tightened, causing water to seep and drip onto the floor. There was no hexagonal wrench at home, and my dad was sarcastic to me again. If there was something wrong with his bathroom cabinet or water heater, he could just walk a few hundred meters and call someone to repair it, but I could only figure out a solution on my own. So, that bathroom cabinet is still seeping water, and the sound of water dripping on the tiles is my dad’s accusation against me. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Looking at it this way, it seems that physical stores rely on price wars to win online shopping. In fact, this is not the case. It’s just that my dad’s consumption concept makes him choose low-priced products. In essence, physical stores still rely on their touchability. The excellent after-sales service earns consumers&#39; dependence and trust on it. What’s even more amazing is that it also allows users to pay by providing emotional value. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One summer night, my parents went shopping to enjoy the cool air. When they came back, they brought a water purifier and a staff member. They also carried a complimentary air purifier and juicer upstairs. I was worried that the two elderly people had been deceived, so I quickly dragged my dad aside and asked him what was going on. The thing is that they were &quot;bewitched&quot; and immediately bought a water purifier. The price was less than 5,000 yuan, and it also came with two gifts. The brand is a regular brand, the store is a regular store, and the staff accompanying me also wear polo shirts with the brand logo printed on them. I subconsciously used my mobile phone to open the brand&#39;s online store and looked for the model my dad bought. After searching to no avail, I consulted online customer service. It turned out that the online and offline models were different. I didn’t buy fakes, but looking at the two gifts, I knew they must be expensive. I still don’t understand the reason why wool comes from sheep. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;My dad is a person who likes petty bargains, but buying a water purifier is not because it is cheap or because of the two gifts, but because the staff really win people&#39;s hearts. They are not robots in online shopping malls that use text to express intimacy. The guy who came to my house to install a water purifier, after being in contact with him for a while, I thought I might not be able to help but pay for him. During the installation process, he patiently explained the knowledge about use and maintenance to my parents. After completion, he was not in a hurry to leave, but opened the packaging of the juicer and demonstrated how to use it. I was standing aside at that time, knowing how to operate the juicer without reading the manual, so he could leave and get off work. But he asked my mother for bananas and milk, put them in the cup, pressed the button, and explained the operation at the same time. The juicer made a sound like an electric drill. My parents stood beside him quietly, watching with smiles. After the juice was finished, he poured two glasses and handed them to my parents. The three of them were talking and laughing. I was at the other end of the living room, watching this scene, and it felt like they were a family of three. Do you think it&#39;s worth the money? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is the emotional value that online shopping is difficult to provide. In addition to a large number of middle-aged and elderly people who cannot use smartphones and shop online, there is also a group of people who firmly believe in physical stores and that only tangible products in the store and face-to-face sales staff can bring a sense of security. The e-commerce economy is booming, but many physical stores are not only surviving, but doing well. I think this is also a little bit of the needs of contemporary people who are prone to emotional emptiness. They need companionship, comfort, real touch and face-to-face communication. Only such care can make cold materials have extra value, and can Be willing to pay for it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(The author is an employee of a state-owned enterprise in Hangzhou, Zhejiang)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>; •&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;(The &quot;hi, Southern Weekly&quot; column of Southern Weekend App is looking forward to your contributions.
