(Visual China/Picture)&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;These days, some staff from local government departments always call Li Bin to ask him about the &quot;trade-in&quot; method of buying a house in Zibo. mode and specific operating procedures. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On September 6, 2023, the Zibo Real Estate Development Association and the Municipal Real Estate Brokerage and Appraisal Association jointly launched a signing ceremony for the &quot;old-for-new&quot; home purchase, with the first batch of 12 companies Representatives of real estate development companies and real estate brokerage agencies signed cooperation agreements. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;According to &quot;Zibo Daily&quot;, &quot;old for new&quot; means exchanging old houses for new ones. Real estate development companies and real estate brokerage agencies join forces to speed up the sales of existing housing. Real estate companies give priority to providing high-quality housing to meet the replacement needs of home buyers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;However, there is still a lot of speculation in the market about the specific method of &quot;trade-in&quot;. On the short video platform, some people interpreted that Zibo’s “old-for-new” policy for home purchases this time allows the appraisal agency to “give the money after the old house has been appraised to the home buyer, and the home buyer will then use the money to buy a new home.”&lt;/p >; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Trading old for new&quot; was the earliest housing sales model tried by Beike. On September 13, as the deputy general manager of Shell (Shandong) Internet Co., Ltd., Li Bin clarified to Southern Weekend reporters: When the original customer replaced, if the second-hand house he lived in before could not be sold, he would not have the funds on hand to buy a new house. Deposit. The current &quot;old-for-new&quot; model requires developers, intermediaries and customers to sign an agreement. According to the agreement, after the customer pays the deposit, the developer will give the customer 90-180 days to sell the house and reserve the customer&#39;s favorite house; The intermediary also promotes customers’ second-hand houses on the platform. If the customer&#39;s house is still not sold after the agreement period, the deposit will be refunded. &quot;The core of &#39;trade-in&#39; old for new&#39; is to shorten the replacement cycle between new and second-hand houses.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image /23/09/15/56104f158b.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;2048&quot; height=&quot;1434&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/15 /56104f158b.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250934&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Local Government Concerned about the decommissioning of new houses&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In Shandong, Jinan City was the first to launch the &quot;old-for-new&quot; policy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In July 2023, the Shandong Real Estate Association and the Jinan Real Estate Association held a seminar on the &quot;Real Estate Market Situation in the First Half of the Year&quot;. In addition to the member units of the Shandong Real Estate Association and the Jinan Real Estate Association, the meeting was also attended by the Shandong Provincial Department of Housing and Urban-Rural Development, the Finance and Economics Office of the Provincial Party Committee, the Jinan Municipal Housing and Urban-Rural Development Bureau and some financial institutions. Li Bin remembers that that meeting was the starting point for the debut of &quot;old for new&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;It was recognized by some developers in Jinan at that time.&quot; Li Bin said that in late August, &quot;old for new&quot; began to be piloted in some projects in Jinan. Taking a project of a real estate company as an example, Beike provides home buyers with second-hand house evaluation, listing, inspection and transaction services. For second-hand houses that meet transaction standards, Beike will help customers sell their houses quickly within 30-90 days; the project team Provide 1%-2% home purchase subsidies to buyers of second-hand houses to speed up the sales of second-hand houses. Among them, buyers of first-hand houses can lock in the house they want by paying 100,000 yuan, and then pay for the new house after the second-hand house is sold. If the second-hand house is not sold, they can enjoy check-out guarantee. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Li Bin remembered that at a real estate brokerage seminar held in Zibo in August, staff from the relevant administrative departments in Zibo also expressed their opinions on this &quot;old-for-new&quot; housing buying and selling model. I was very interested and suggested that Zibo&#39;s industry associations could also try to promote it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;The core method is to shorten the transaction time between new homes and second homes, and the government plays a supporting and encouraging role in this.&quot; Li Bin introduced. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Zhuge housing search data shows that from January to July 2023, the price of new houses in Zibo continued to climb, rising from 8,272 yuan/square meter to 8,425 yuan/square meter. But the price dropped to 8,389 yuan/square meter in August. In contrast, Zibo&#39;s second-hand housing prices have been rising month after month, and since November 2022, there has been an inversion of primary and second-hand housing prices. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Li Bin explained to Southern Weekend reporters that &quot;replacing old houses with new ones&quot; requires accelerating the disposal of second-hand houses and at the same time making a good connection with the replacement of new houses. If the second-hand house in the hands of the home buyer cannot be sold, he will not have the down payment for the new house, and he will not be able to make the decision to buy a new house. &quot;Data shows that the average transaction cycle for second-hand houses in Jinan City is now 175 days, and even more than 250 days in Zibo.&quot; In smaller cities and counties, the transaction cycle for second-hand houses will be longer. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Li Bin introduced that the &quot;old-for-new&quot; policy for buying houses will be implemented in many cities in Shandong such as Tai&#39;an and Jining. In addition to Shandong, some cities outside the province also want to learn about relevant experiences. Li Bin found that the local governments who came to communicate would be more concerned about the sale of new houses. “After all, the sale of new houses is the most important means for cities to activate the real estate market.” &lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;There are more people waiting and watching&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;September 8, &quot;Zibo Daily&quot; More than 40 first-hand properties with &quot;old-for-new&quot; agreements were announced. However, several local real estate agents in Zibo told Southern Weekend reporters that more people who want to buy a house are still waiting and watching. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Zhang Yuan (pseudonym), a real estate agent in Zibo City, told Southern Weekend reporters that after the introduction of the &quot;old for new&quot; policy, the number of people viewing houses has increased significantly, more than before. One-third, his daily working hours also increased from the original 12 hours to 14 hours. He said that if the agent fails to sell the old house within the three months stipulated in the agreement, the client will take back the old house and the deposit, which is &quot;equivalent to three months of work in vain.&quot; Zhang Yuan explained that the policy will bring greater workload to the intermediary, but if the client is sure to sell the old house, he will have more confidence to buy a new house. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Another Zibo real estate agent, Sun Yu (pseudonym), updated his policy interpretation on the short video platform on September 8. In addition, he receives twenty or thirty related consultation calls every day. There are people who are in a hurry to sell their old house and buy a new one and ask more than a dozen questions at once, while there are also people who inquire casually and take a wait-and-see attitude. Sun Yu told Southern Weekend reporters that developers of large real estate projects generally do not accept old houses. “If he (the developer) wants to sell new houses, why would he buy second-hand houses?” As for intermediaries, they are generally willing to represent large-property houses. , that is, houses where the owner owns the house and can produce a real estate certificate, &quot;the sales difficulty is low and the transaction rate is higher.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Sun Yu said that the second-hand houses for sale in his hands are mainly located in Zhangdian West District, the main urban area of ​​Zibo, which is also what the intermediary calls Zibo&#39;s &quot;prime location.&quot; The highest price here exceeds 20,000 yuan per square meter, while in the suburbs with the lowest prices, one square meter sells for only 5,000 to 6,000 yuan, which is a quarter of the price in the central city. &quot;The first-hand properties participating in the &#39;trade-in&#39; program are not very easy to sell,&quot; Sun Yu said. Most of them are located in the suburbs of Zibo with relatively poor locations, and the number of houses in the school district is relatively small. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;But there are already customers who have successfully &quot;traded in old products for new ones&quot; with Sun Yu. This is a 35-year-old customer. He needs to sell his old house in the eastern part of Zhangdian District before he can have enough budget to buy a house in a school district. Previously, this old house had been listed on the trading platform for nearly half a year without any interest. In the past few days, Sun Yu sold the client&#39;s old house for 800,000 yuan, and the client spent more than 1.5 million yuan to buy a school district house in the southwest area of ​​Zhangdian. In Sun Yu&#39;s opinion, this is one of the best-located houses in the first-hand real estate that participates in the &quot;old-for-new&quot; project. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Sun Yu currently opens his own real estate agency in Zibo, with more than a dozen employees, and his business focuses on the sale of first-hand and second-hand houses. He said that the current policy has not brought significant changes in sales volume to the company. In 2023, the company&#39;s monthly housing sales will mainly be concentrated in 3 to 5 units. The New Deal has led to more people consulting, &quot;but everyone is very cautious, and there are more people waiting and watching.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 16 Sep 2023 16:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[当“知心闺蜜”恶语相向之前：李佳琦这样的“赛博货郎”何以逆势成功？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256854]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-16 15:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Recently, &quot;the most powerful beauty blogger&quot; Li Jiaqi angrily criticized consumers in the live broadcast room. Li Jiaqi himself has been caught in the whirlpool of public opinion. Even after he apologized in tears, the criticism and accusations against him have not subsided. In addition to pushing him to the forefront of public opinion, this storm has also focused the public&#39;s attention on In the industry of &quot;carrying anchor&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before getting involved in this verbal controversy, Li Jiaqi had built an astonishing business empire through years of hard work in the field of beauty live streaming. The total sales of his short video platform live broadcast room in one month exceeded &quot;Shocking records&quot; such as 1 billion yuan and 15,000 lipsticks sold in 5 minutes have even triggered communication scholars to study its sales discourse system and communication strategies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Judging from the main consumer portraits, Li Jiaqi mainly targets female audiences, which can be seen from his iconic opening remarks &quot;all girls&quot; during his live broadcast. In addition to the skilled symbolic use of &quot;girlfriend accents&quot; such as &quot;Your devil is here&quot;, &quot;Oh my god&quot;, &quot;It&#39;s so pretty&quot;, &quot;Buy it, buy it&quot;, Li Jiaqi is also very good at using hierarchical contrast communication strategies. Through &quot;lifting and stepping on&quot;, we create a &quot;superior&quot; consumption satisfaction for consumers. For example, when describing the lipstick brand as &quot;rustic&quot;, Li Jiaqi would use rhetorical methods such as &quot;the color my mother painted twenty years ago&quot; to awaken consumers&#39; memories. When recommending their own products, they will use rhetorical means such as &quot;You are the peach in the world&quot;, &quot;You will be a lady if you paint it&quot;, &quot;Limited edition of XX color&quot;, etc. to provide female consumers with room for imagination and inspire them. Consumer impulse to place a single trial. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Consumers, mainly female, are willing to spend money in Li Jiaqi’s live broadcast room not only because of their recognition and affirmation of the professional ability of his “lipstick brother”, but also because of his “close friend” trust and favor. Similarly, what female consumers buy in Li Jiaqi’s live broadcast room is not only lipstick and eyebrow pencil, but also emotional value. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So the cause and result of the &quot;censorship incident&quot; are actually very simple. For anchors, under the pressure of the stock game and the economic downturn, even Li Jiaqi, who is precise and proficient in the &quot;girlfriend accent&quot; and &quot;the best understanding of women&#39;s hearts&quot;, has perfect head anchors to mobilize consumers&#39; consumption impulses. Times are not as easy as before, and the resulting fatigue and irritability are themselves a natural reflection of the economic and social environment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For consumers, it is emotionally difficult for consumers to have their “best friends” who have flattered and flattered them in the past and provided full emotional value regardless of whether they consume or not, suddenly lower their faces and say nasty things to them. accepted. Although Li Jiaqi often calls and describes consumers as &quot;princess&quot;, &quot;lady&quot; and &quot;queen&quot;, in fact, his main consumer groups are still mainly working-class people. They are commonly known as &quot;workers&quot; and are involved in the pressure of the workplace. When I was exhausted and tried to find emotional value in the live broadcast room of my &quot;best friend&quot;, I was accused of &quot;not trying hard&quot; by the other party. It is also a normal emotional reaction to get angry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It can be said that the &quot;censorship incident&quot; was actually an instant hedging of the common emotions between Li Jiaqi and consumers under pressure. But Li Jiaqi and consumers are not the only ones under pressure. At a time when &quot;it&#39;s not easy for everyone to make money,&quot; the way for &quot;Li Jiaqi&quot; to make money seems too easy, so the &quot;censorship incident&quot; has become an outlet for that pressure. While the public used this incident to vent their stress and emotions, they also began to think about how &quot;goods anchors&quot; became an &quot;easy to make money&quot; industry in our society. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, Li Jiaqi’s role in the entire beauty industry chain is more similar to that of a salesman selling needles, threads, and cosmetics boxes in pre-modern society. He is neither a producer of goods nor a businessman who opens a store to do business in the traditional sense, but a more special kind of sales terminal. In the old society, due to the restrictions of etiquette, women could neither move around nor obtain information about goods. These housewives, who had limited information and limited knowledge, needed the medium of a salesman to understand and purchase goods. Therefore, in ancient society, a successful salesman must be a person who is familiar with women&#39;s psychological characteristics, masters certain speaking skills, and can speak into women&#39;s hearts. A ballad from the old society goes like this:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Salesman Son, selling flower thread, carrying a load on the street. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Jingle bell shakes to call the girl, and leads her to meet her at the door. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The girl should smile and be angry again, and the price should be cheap and the goods should be new. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fortunately, the salesman is blessed with beauty and often has sex with beauties in his life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It can be seen that modern &quot;beauty anchors&quot; are in the same vein as the ancient salesmen selling needle threads and cosmetics boxes in terms of understanding the psychological characteristics of consumers, formulating targeted marketing strategies, and matching the emotional value of sales. It is precisely because of this characteristic that there was widespread prejudice and discrimination against the profession of peddlers in the old society. It was believed that they behaved improperly and would seduce women whenever they had the opportunity. In Ming and Qing dynasty novels, there were many peddlers who seduced, abducted and trafficked women. The story of a good woman. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From the perspective of business development form theory, peddlers in the old society were the product of poor business information in a closed and semi-closed &quot;acquaintance society&quot; environment. In the information age, there are various sales channels and sales methods, open product information is readily available, and various product advertisements are overwhelming. In this environment, there should be no living space for &quot;cyber peddlers&quot;, at least other It should not occupy such an important position and proportion in modern business activities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But reality is exactly the opposite of theory. The &quot;cyber gangsters&quot; represented by Li Jiaqi have not only bucked the trend and achieved great success in the modern information society, but also work part-time with &quot;Internet celebrities&quot; in some other countries. The business model of carrying goods is different. In my country, &quot;cyber hawkers&quot; have developed into a specialized profession and formed a large professional group, becoming the most important and powerful sales channel and method of online e-commerce. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the world&#39;s largest manufacturing country, the world&#39;s largest informatization country, and the world&#39;s largest online retail country, consumers&#39; consumption habits have returned to a certain extent to the &quot;hawker model&quot; of pre-modern society. , there are actually very profound reasons behind this counter-intuitive, counter-logical, and counter-intuitive reality. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First of all, it is precisely because of the huge abundance of products, the explosive growth of product information, and the seamless coverage of product advertisements that consumers in the ocean of products and information feel confused and confused. . At the same time, the cost of &quot;trial and error&quot; has also increased exponentially, and consumers who are unwilling to delve into relevant knowledge and compare the pros and cons of similar products in order to buy a product will naturally return to &quot;acquaintances&quot; in another sense. Society&quot;, that is, choosing to trust the &quot;enthusiastic recommendations&quot; of the &quot;cyber peddlers&quot; you like. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Secondly, the information society certainly has its noisy and bustling side, but behind the information explosion, surging public opinion, and all-weather socialization, the spiritual loneliness of atomized individuals on the Internet is also a serious problem. As mentioned earlier, what Li Jiaqi, the &quot;cyber salesman&quot; provides, is not just lipstick and eyebrow pencil, but also emotional value. Perhaps, the latter is more important than the former in determining the role of the ancient profession of &quot;cyber salesman&quot; in this modern information age. A broad and permanent living space in the commercial society. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is the author&#39;s personal opinion only and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot; https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style= &quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 16 Sep 2023 15:25:03 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[林家栋：要把角色的灵魂、内心抓出来]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256835]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-16 14:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/13/OugasTfNJ5ML9yNbtsKg8Ese6jTVvmFQwr4ZgUOK.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/OugasTfNJ5ML9yNbtsKg8Ese6jTVvmFQ wr4ZgUOK. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250583&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>; (Visual China/Picture) &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2019, police officer Wang Shouyue retired in Guangdong.

At the dinner, he thought of the unsolved cases and the uncaught people, and he felt depressed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Shouyue read the news about a fire somewhere in Yunnan on his mobile phone. There was a very familiar face among the passersby. He was sure that it was Chen Xinwen, the main suspect who robbed a cash transport truck and killed his police colleague more than 20 years ago. . Wearing casual clothes, he embarked on the journey alone, carrying a bag of fruit to visit Chen Xinwen, who had been living incognito for many years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/jRRYqkC3rNmbY3a1KtAAEoIW1ZbU1J7s6unHPf1l.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;540&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/jRRYqkC3rNmbY3a1KtAAEoIW1ZbU1J7s6unHPf1l.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250584&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&quot;The Eighth Suspect&quot; (2023)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the movie &quot;The Eighth Suspect&quot; released on September 9, 2023, Hong Kong actor Lin Jiadong Plays the role of retired policeman Wang Shouyue. There is only one gunfight scene in the film, and there is no suspense element. The audience already knows who the person who has not been arrested is. The highlight is the details of the confrontation between Wang Shouyue and Chen Xinwen. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This film will be shortlisted for the main competition unit of the Shanghai International Film Festival in June 2023. When interviewed, rival actors Dapeng (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;plays Chen Xinwen&lt;/span>;) and Sun Yang mentioned that they are used to rehearsing before filming, while Jiadong and Lin The other actors kept their distance and &quot;just come up and give it&quot; to protect the immediacy of their reactions. Lin Jiadong is very relaxed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What they were talking about was an office drama. Wang Shouyue could not bear the noise of construction at the construction site and went to the construction company to report the situation. Chen Xinwen and several others were studying the drawings. Wang Shouyue thought they were studying real estate development, but in fact they were plotting to rob. That was a few days before the shocking case occurred more than 20 years ago. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I don&#39;t know what you will do next, and you don&#39;t know what I will do next, so outside of the camera, we keep a sense of distance.&quot; Lin Jiadong said. He felt this was the best way to communicate that suited the needs of the character. Cheung Song-man, who plays a police colleague, likes to be flexible on the set, and Lam Ji-tung happily accepted the role. &quot;I can change whatever you suddenly change. Because my role is still in my hands, and your role is still in your hands.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lin Jiadong has been a film actor for 22 years. In 2002, he played a policeman in a movie for the first time, as Big B in &quot;Infernal Affairs&quot;. On the rooftop, after the duel scene between Chen Yongren and Liu Jianming pointed guns at each other and revealed their trump cards, the audience thought the outcome was decided. Unexpectedly, in the elevator, Big B appeared and simply killed the real policeman Chen Yongren, revealing his identity as an undercover gangster. The identity caught Liu Jianming, a fake policeman who was also an undercover and wanted to start a new life, off guard. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is the last scene of the whole film. Before this, Lin Jiadong had never seen the complete script, and he really thought that Big B was a good policeman - the director intended it. Suddenly learning that his identity was reversed, Lin Jiadong panicked, fearing that he would make a mistake. At that time, he was still ignorant and needed to listen to the arrangements of his seniors. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In an early episode of &quot;A Date with Lu Yu&quot;, Andy Lau, who played Liu Jianming and was Lin Jiadong&#39;s boss, mentioned that he wanted Lin Jiadong to lose the &quot;air of a TV series&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/Xwtcx2vxeG6phdNkczSzs9mfN7KAhSHKekv8icwR.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/Xwtcx2vxeG6phdNkczSzs9mfN7KAhSHKekv8icwR.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250586&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&quot;Slaying the Wolf: Greedy Wolf&quot; (2017)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lin Jiadong entered the TVB artist training class in 1987. The first time he filmed was during the Spring Festival, which was originally scheduled The actors went on strike, so he had a chance to take over. In the 1990s, he became a relatively successful actor in TV dramas. The high-intensity shooting schedule made him feel brain-blocked and &quot;he wanted to be perfect, but he couldn&#39;t do it.&quot; He wanted to change his life, switched to the film industry, and signed a contract with Andy Lau&#39;s company. &quot;Even if it is an idle role or an inconspicuous small role, when the camera comes to you, you will be the protagonist for the second.

In a year of handover between gangs and winning streaks, the younger generation competes for power. Dongguan Zai, played by Lam Jiadong, is loyal to one of the factions. He is obedient, ruthless, and his ambitions gradually expand. Fans began to recognize him. Soon, the role of the traitor Li Zhao in &quot;Ip Man&quot; (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;2008&lt;/span>;) won Lam Jiadong the Hong Kong Film Awards (&lt; span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;&quot;Hereinafter referred to as the Academy Awards&quot;&lt;/span>;) Nominated for Best Supporting Actor. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/sepyjFDz5nBfX5DhRUB7nlA43arTY2X1K4i8E3fg.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height= &quot;533&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/sepyjFDz5nBfX5DhRUB7nlA43arTY2X1K4i8E3fg.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250589&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&quot;Ip Man&quot; (2008)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hong Kong is rich in police and gangster movies. Lam Jiadong has played both police and gangsters. Some of the policemen he plays are polite and capable, while others are sophisticated. &quot;I have been a policeman many times, and every time I am looking for differences. Because I believe that a person who has lived for so many years must have different mental states, thoughts, and personalities. . I have this opportunity to put different possibilities.&quot; Lin Jiadong said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/bgR83OjJYp2oQWymrd1m26vKCXFEnubavG0JtX1D.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/bgR83OjJYp2oQWymrd1m26vKCXFEnubavG0JtX1D.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250585&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&quot;Cold War&quot; (2012)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2013, he won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his role as Albert, a senior police officer in &quot;Cold War&quot; Nominated. In the film, the hawks and the civil servants are at odds with each other, the rivalry between Tony Leung Ka Fai and Aaron Kwok is brilliant, and the new police officer played by Eddie Peng is a lurking villain who wants to help his father (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: italics, italics_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Tony Leung Ka Fai&#39;s role&lt;/span>;) clears the obstacles to promotion and has a big turn; in comparison, Albert&#39;s image is by no means the fullest and most brilliant, but Lin Jiadong holds his own. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lin Jiadong has also played a kind-faced but cold-blooded gangster. With the indifferent King of Thieves, he also won the Hong Kong Film Awards, the Hong Kong Film Critics Society, and the Hong Kong Film Directors Association Best Actor. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/npjwyFz4FWkI6toJ9VmpUmau97eTgt5bT0KVEMQh.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;660&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/npjwyFz4FWkI6toJ9VmpUmau97eTgt5bT0KVEMQh.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250588&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&quot;Wisdom Teeth&quot; (2021)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2022, he won two Academy Awards for Best Actor for the two films &quot;Hand-Rolled Cigarettes&quot; and &quot;Wisdom Teeth&quot; Protagonist nomination. Among them, &quot;Hand-Rolled Cigarettes&quot; he starred in for zero pay, playing a person abandoned by society: his character Guan Chao was a Chinese-American British soldier more than 20 years ago. After retirement, his life was frustrated, he owed loan sharks, and made a living as a gangster. A hunted Indian in trouble ends up in danger himself. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lin Jiadong is 56 years old this year. His screen image in recent years, from Guan Chao to Wang Shouyue, has a gloomy and aging look. But he himself is well maintained and has a slim figure. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One night in early September, at around 9 o&#39;clock, after a busy day&#39;s work, Lin Jiadong&#39;s interest was still high when he talked about performances, such as &quot;Homicide&quot; (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: italics, italics_ GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;2023&lt;/span>;) His free play in the rooftop scene at the end of the film allowed him to play the numerology master who muttered to himself after the split personality: &quot;I am a flower, I am a flower.&quot; For example, The subtle change in Guan Chao&#39;s attitude toward Indians in &quot;Hand-Rolled Cigarettes&quot; is due to the change of the other person&#39;s name. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He has an excellent memory and can quickly recall the last scene of &quot;Underworld&quot; and how the ambitious Dongguan boy handled the lines breathlessly. From time to time, he added body movements to restore the image of himself locked in a room and thinking hard: he would collapse on the sofa, sit up again for half an hour, and act as if he were reading a script, looking for a breakthrough. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Shouyue is a boring person. After finally retiring, his life still feels like work. This may be a bit like Lin Jiadong. He has appeared on TVB or other TV talk shows many times and said that he is boring and boring. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He is a hard-working actor. Even if he won the Best Actor Award, he said he could only &quot;have fun for 48 hours&quot; and then he would want to work. That year, holding the trophy, he said to himself on the stage, calm down. Then he said, &quot;Over the years, I have felt that acting does not matter age. It does not matter about appearance, the most important thing is your own heart.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The following is Lin Jiadong&#39;s account:&lt;/p>; &lt; h4>;Police feelings&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;I think Wang Shouyue&#39;s character is a bit different. In the past, I have watched many police movies depicting police officers. There isn’t much emotion shown, but this time I think it’s a good opportunity because this character is a person with emotions. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;The first dinner was at the retirement dinner. I actually felt a little depressed and regretful. After more than 20 years, (The suspect) can’t be seen or caught, what should I do? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Later I confronted the character of Dapeng and gradually got to know him. He had done something wrong. A poor man who decided. I saw the newsreel of him at the fire scene, which was not too glamorous, so I wanted to see with my own eyes what he was like now. He must be not doing well, right? I don’t know if we can capture him and by what method. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;In the office scene, the character conflicts have not yet appeared. What I do is follow my body language to put pressure on them: come back - stop - go, talk, come back again, blah blah, like this. I think it can be handled this way, it is enough. If there are too many emotions, it will be fake. You don’t know who they are, and they don’t know who you are. If I want to make the audience feel the pressure through the picture, this reaction of body language is enough. . &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Before every performance, I am used to taking a look at the scene here to adapt to my identity and mood. , my relationship with other characters in it. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;I must respect the style of the director and cinematographer. Some directors and photographers use the lens to help them do a lot of things. They don’t need me to do much. I will cooperate with you on the shooting scene. But if it’s a fixed shot and you let me go, then the camera lens is here, the space is so big, I can do as much as I can in this space. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Emotionality and Sobriety&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;The actor is very emotional inside the camera, but outside the camera We should be sober. I remember who I met and what I talked about every day. I will ask friends with different ideas how they feel about new immigrants. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 凯体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;There are different people in every industry, and I want to feel where their vitality lies. Every time I take a vacation, I chat with some friends from outside the industry. Some are in aquatic services, drive taxis, sell diamonds, do public relations for big brands, and some are bosses, working in finance in Central. Most of my friends are very talkative. If I listen more, I will understand that their life circle, thinking, and common attitude are like this. Their lives satisfy me. I slowly accumulate and build my experience, and I know very concretely about future performances. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;For example, many large companies lay off employees, always laying off front-line people. Your manager’s one month’s labor If the cost is enough for 10 people, it would be enough to lay off one of you. But many companies have more generals than soldiers. Why is it so strange? This involves the issue of human nature. People must protect themselves. But if the general has 10 fewer soldiers, how can he fight? There are really too many problems in life. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;I was originally the villain in &quot;Cold War&quot;. I told the director that I was very happy to play the villain, but it would be very damaging to your movie. In reality, for the management of a large company to survive, it depends not only on how strong the ability is, but also on patience. Don&#39;t go too far, you must know how to accept it. Albert has a doctorate in law and is extremely well-educated. It is impossible for him to be attracted to Peng Yuyan&#39;s role. Two weeks later, the director really changed it and made my character die in the end, which made me happy. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;When I was young, I seldom spoke. My elder sister was the only one who talked at home, and my elder sister didn’t understand. We rarely communicate about boys’ ideas. But I read a lot of things every day, and I’m thinking in my head, why is this like this? Wear a black suit to a wedding banquet. My friend, when I go to a funeral parlor, I wear a black suit, so how do I tell whether it’s a red event or a white event? Lots of whys. Later, when we took a training class, the teacher also told us that life is an experience, and you must remember this feeling. Just think more carefully, watch more, think more, find a root for the character&#39;s personality, and your future creations will be more reasonable. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;My friend and I were very bored. We were hungry after 1 o&#39;clock at night, so we asked where we could eat supper. OK? Tea restaurants are the best, offering both Chinese and Western food and drinks. Takeout, no need. Go in and sit down, eat what you want, and see if you are fat (at this time). If I&#39;m not fat, I like to eat ketchup powder the most. If I&#39;m fat, I can&#39;t drink milk tea or coffee. My friend and I ordered a set meal. I’ll give you the food, and I can just drink this, so there’s no waste. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;The tea restaurant is a very real place without so many shackles. In the hotel, everyone is very quiet, saying something they don’t know (simulating whispers), and no emotion can be seen. There is a very real life in the tea restaurant, people are very willing to express their emotions, and you can learn a little gossip. This is the most comfortable look. I&#39;m going now too. It is not difficult to be a mountain person and close yourself off; but life is very important and it is important to experience life, otherwise how can we perform? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/gyGjrnRLSWDVdFArYwioQoc7oOLyCVEKigrDKXXL.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 960&quot; height=&quot;543&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/gyGjrnRLSWDVdFArYwioQoc7oOLyCVEKigrDKXXL.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250587&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&quot;Infernal Affairs&quot; (2002)&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Unwilling&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;When I came to TVB in the 1980s, I had no idea what acting was, so I took that training class.

Andy Lau, Liu Weiqiang, you lied to me, why should I shoot Chen Yongren? OK, give me a minute. They must know the script very well. I only know a little bit about the character and I don&#39;t know anything else, so I have to trust them. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;But I must admit that after editing, I can accept the finished film.

When I arrived at the scene, I just got the script 30 minutes ago and knew the dialogue, so I gave it a try. Just go with your feelings. The director said OK, and I asked if I could do another one. The director said, I think it’s OK. Really? I feel like I owe a little bit. Director Du said I don&#39;t need it, don&#39;t you believe me? I believe it. (Laughs)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;We can&#39;t watch the playback either, only the director can. There were only one or two group scenes, and other times there was no opponent, just me acting alone. So I don&#39;t really have much idea. Watching it in the cinema, I thought, can a performance be like this? It turns out that the creative changes are so big. The screenwriter and director know us actors very well and can change us to a certain extent, giving the audience a very new but very real feeling. I think it is very powerful and has a profound impact on me. Then I should still have a chance. I am not willing to be like this. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;It was my first time to go to &quot;Ip Man&quot;. The shooting of that movie had not started yet. I went to Shanghai, I hid in my room for the first three days and nights. I didn&#39;t leave the room to eat. My assistant brought the food and put it at the door. It was like living in a prison. The film was shot in three days. I thought about how to deal with this character. With this little space, I could express the helplessness of Li Zhao. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Li Zhao is a traitor, and it is not good to be a traitor, but I told the director that I ( Referring to Li Zhao) I am not in Beijing or Nanjing, so I cannot see the issue of power. I am in Foshan, and I really don’t have much money, so I have to survive. In one scene, the opposite character died. I never thought that people would die for a bag of rice. It didn’t matter if they were beaten or injured. There was nothing you could do about it in those days, but death seemed a little too much. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;During filming, because the director did not call cut, I gave a long reaction. I asked the director to make it longer, even if it was cut later. At that time, I began to know that I had to capture the soul and heart of the character. Fortunately, director Sammo Hung said it could be done. Thanks. &quot;Ip Man&quot; gave me the opportunity, the camera, and the time to do it. Let me tell the audience again through this lens, Li Zhao, are you sad? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Think about it first&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;After filming a scene, I will let myself becomes blank. I take a computer with me when I go to other places. I can stay in my room for a whole day without going out, watching and thinking, because I have entered another character and I don’t think about the past anymore. It’s easy to get stuck if you keep thinking about the past. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;I don&#39;t regard it as a job, it is my interest. Sometimes the director calls and asks: Are you in the company? &quot;Here.&quot; &quot;How are you lately? I thought of a case, what do you think?&quot; &quot;It&#39;s interesting.&quot; &quot;Then I&#39;ll bring the screenwriter over to talk to you in two days.&quot; &quot;Okay.&quot; That&#39;s it. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;For example, recently, there was an investor who was not looking for me to perform. He said that now Hong Kong Movies are really difficult, and he hopes to make a limited-edition film with content. Let me think about it, it could be this or that. He said, &quot;Can you be my producer? Come and talk to the director.&quot; Then the investor asked me to perform. I thought it would be fun, so I collaborated with him. The project is still in the creation stage. Everyone feels that Hong Kong movies may have fewer and fewer themes. I hope that through my own efforts, I can get more space for the audience to watch different themes. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/RG5lr3MtdiJIj0PKTqAtcYOrTRRINVk7VRLWrHsk.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/RG5lr3MtdiJIj0PKTqAtcYOrTRRINVk7VRLWrHsk.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250581&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&quot;Hand-rolled Cigarettes&quot; (2020)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;《 The film &quot;Hand-Rolling Cigarettes&quot; is supported by the Hong Kong government (Author&#39;s note: &quot;Hand-Rolling Cigarettes&quot; is the winning entry in the fourth tertiary college category of Hong Kong&#39;s &quot;First Feature Film Project&quot; and was filmed with funding from the Hong Kong Film Development Council) and is spent on Hong Kong tax dollars People’s money, I said I don’t want the remuneration, but I have to work on the script well. I talked to the Film Development Bureau: I think this subject has potential, but I think it can be better. Can you give me three more months? The other party said yes, you can just perform. I kept chatting with the director and producer. I felt there was room for improvement. Don’t waste it. Think about it first.

On August 30, 2023, a netizen surnamed Liu with the online name &quot;Liu Shao&quot; reported in real name on the social media platform that there were construction quality problems in the Qinghai Tongsai Expressway Taohe Bridge built by China Railway Fifth Engineering Bureau No. 5 Company. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu claimed to be the actual construction party and began to undertake the substructure project of the Taohe Bridge on April 6, 2022, which lasted more than eight months. He reported that the project leader of China Railway No. 5 Bureau No. 5 Company &quot;did not use steel bars from the shortlisted manufacturers according to the design, privately used non-standard steel bars from non-shortlisted manufacturers, cut corners during construction, and used unqualified sand and gravel materials during winter construction, resulting in poor concrete quality.&quot; qualified&quot;. Among them, statements such as &quot;the pile inspection process changed the second-category piles to the first-category piles&quot;, &quot;80% of the pile foundation steel bars are unqualified&quot; and &quot;there are hidden safety and quality risks&quot; attracted the attention of the outside world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the evening of September 6, the Fifth Company of China Railway No. 5 Bureau issued a public statement stating that it had previously entrusted Qinghai Provincial Traffic Inspection Co., Ltd. as a third-party testing agency to conduct quality inspections on the bridge. The inspection report shows that &quot;the physical quality of the Taohe Bridge meets the design requirements and the quality is qualified.&quot; The steel bars and concrete used in the construction are all qualified, and the pile foundation tests are all Class I piles. Liu&#39;s reports have been refuted one by one. At present, the competent authority has entrusted a testing agency to &quot;conduct physical quality inspection and raw material sampling inspection&quot;, and the re-inspection results will be announced to the public in a timely manner. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu didn’t buy it. He showed evidence to &quot;Running News&quot; and said, &quot;The test report I got contains Class II piles.&quot; The pouring time was May 26, 2022. The test date is June 29, 2022. Liu admitted that he made the report because the Fifth Company of China Railway No. 5 Bureau not only refused to pay him for his labor services, but instead cleared him from the site, causing heavy losses to him. “Now I have to report the project quality issues even if I don’t need any money.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to media reports, Liu was sued by China Railway No. 5 Bureau No. 5 Company to the People&#39;s Court of Ledu District, Haidong City, Qinghai Province for infringing the company&#39;s reputation rights because he reported that his labor fees had not been settled. The case will be heard in court on September 18. Liu also presented evidence, saying that he had received a message from the other party &quot;Look at the hardness of our China Railway No. 5 Bureau&quot; after reporting with his real name; the other party also proposed a &quot;compensation plan&quot;, but he did not agree if he was not satisfied. The Fifth Company of China Railway No. 5 Bureau responded that Liu’s main purpose was blackmail and “I will report it as soon as I don’t get the blackmail.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This incident has evolved to this point and has gradually become &quot;out of focus&quot;: the dispute between Liu and China Railway has become a new hot spot. A closer look at this incident reveals that there are actually two important aspects that deserve further analysis and questioning. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First, the relationship between the civil dispute between Liu and the Fifth Company of China Railway Fifth Engineering Bureau and his reporting behavior. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Whether it is Liu&#39;s self-report or the &quot;extortion of money&quot; accusation from China Railway No. 5 Bureau, it is shown that the report was due to Liu&#39;s financial demands and that the two parties had a civil dispute. But what is curious is why the case was initiated by China Railway No. 5 Engineering Co., Ltd. against Liu for &quot;infringement of reputation rights&quot; instead of Liu launching a civil lawsuit against China Railway No. 5 Engineering Co., Ltd. due to a labor contract dispute? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The cause of this incident was an economic dispute over &quot;unpaid labor fees&quot;. Following this line of thought, Liu first reported the problem when he could not get the labor fee, but was sued for &quot;infringement of reputation rights&quot;. Then, instead of filing a civil lawsuit on the grounds of a labor contract dispute and demanding payment of the labor fee, he filed an online lawsuit He reported that the project was cutting corners and materials, saying &quot;I have to report project quality problems even if I don&#39;t get labor fees,&quot; and rejected China Railway&#39;s compensation plan. This shows that Liu escalated the incident at all costs, giving the outside world the impression that &quot;the fish is dead and the net is broken.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Looking at the evolution of the incident, there are still some questions hidden in the game between the two parties during this period: Has Liu&#39;s labor fee been settled? If it was indeed not settled, Liu initially went to China Railway Fifth Engineering Bureau and the relevant departments in Qinghai to report this problem. I am afraid it was just a normal rights protection. Why was he sued by the Fifth Company of China Railway Fifth Engineering Bureau for &quot;infringement of the company&#39;s reputation rights&quot;? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the chat records provided by Liu, the words of a person from the China Railway No. 5 Bureau after the real-name report, &quot;The more you cause trouble, the less afraid I am. Look at the hardness of our China Railway No. 5 Bureau&quot; to the outside world. It leaves more room for interpretation. This sentence can make people reasonably speculate that Liu chose to &quot;turn the table&quot; by exposing the quality problems of the project precisely because his demands for labor fees were repeatedly ignored by the other party. So, will the labor fees be settled on time, or will the compensation plan of China Railway No. 5 Bureau No. 5 Company satisfy Liu after the report, and the matter will be settled smoothly? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If Liu came out to expose the project quality problems just because the labor fees were not paid, and the project quality problems were true, then the whole incident would have the flavor of &quot;unevenly sharing the spoils, and turning the table over in anger&quot;. The problem behind it is undoubtedly more worrying; or, if the truth is as claimed by China Railway No. 5 Bureau No. 5 Company, Liu intends to &quot;extort money&quot;, then whether the test results and the evidence he presented are forged, and how much his labor fees are? A clear answer should also be given as to why it was not settled and why it was not settled. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Secondly, whether the truth of the incident is that Liu extorted money or that the Fifth Company of the China Railway Fifth Bureau was in arrears of labor fees, it cannot conceal the most important focus of this incident: whether the construction of the Taohe Bridge on the Tongsai Expressway was completed. Through safety inspection, whether there are any project quality problems. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Public information shows that the Tongsai Expressway has a total length of 204 kilometers, and the total estimated investment of the project is 18.562 billion yuan. The main project will start on June 15, 2022, and is planned to be completed in October 2025. This expressway connects Qinghai Huangnan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture and the Qinghai-Gansu border area. It is a section of the &quot;G0611 Zhangwen Expressway&quot;. The Taohe Bridge is located in Saierlong Township, with a total length of 824.5 meters and a total of 20 spans. On July 17, 2023, the first box girder of the bridge was successfully erected. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu Mou chose to report after the substructure project of the Taohe Bridge was completed and the first box girder was successfully erected. Judging from the current situation, it was because of the intensification of economic disputes. Which one is more convincing is the previous test results announced by the fifth company of China Railway Fifth Engineering Bureau, the test results of the supervision company commissioned by Liu himself, and the evidence presented. This is something that the competent authorities should conduct an in-depth and serious investigation in the follow-up. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, inconsistencies between actual construction and prior surveys are relatively common in the engineering community. If Liu&#39;s accusation is true and China Railway No. 5 Bureau No. 5 Company chooses &quot;non-standard steel bars, unqualified sand and gravel materials and Class II piles&quot; in construction, its impact on the quality of the project will also need to be determined through professional evaluation. The key to the problem is whether changing construction materials will affect the quality of the project and thus endanger the safety of the Taohe Bridge. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In short, the focus of this matter should not be on the dispute between Liu and China Railway No. 5 Bureau. Relevant departments should adhere to the principle of safety first in the follow-up investigation, focus on the inspection of project quality, investigate whether the fifth company of China Railway No. 5 Bureau made normal changes in construction materials or cut corners, and fully demonstrate the impact of changes in construction materials on the traffic of the Taohe Bridge. impact on safety and fully disclose the findings to the public. If there is indeed a case of cutting corners and affecting the quality of the bridge, the relevant responsible persons should be severely dealt with and even held criminally responsible; if the whistleblower spreads rumors and causes trouble, he cannot go unpunished. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 16 Sep 2023 11:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[“数字”间谍来自何处？有何招式？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256665]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-16 10:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;span>;The current development of network technology is rapid, and new things such as 5G, Metaverse, ChatGPT and so on are emerging.

It is written on a stainless steel plate with white paint and is 32 meters long and 3.5 meters high. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The first impression given by &quot;Chaoshu&quot; is its white cloth and unique composition. &quot;Zhangfa&quot; and &quot;Bubai&quot; are calligraphy terms, which refer to the arrangement, layout and mutual response between words and lines during the entire writing process. In traditional calligraphy works, the line spacing is roughly clear, and the strokes cannot cross between words. Even the continuous grass of the late Ming Dynasty will still generally abide by such rules. &quot;Look at Xu Wei&#39;s &quot;Ying Zhi Ying Sword&quot;, there are a few places where the strokes touch and cross, but it is not obvious.&quot; Wang Dongling zoomed in on Xu Wei&#39;s work on her mobile phone and kept zooming in until the complete picture could no longer be seen. Glyphs and dancing lines fill the entire phone screen. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When he was a child, Wang Dongling observed an old tree in front of his teacher’s house, and the zigzag lines were imprinted in his memory. Later, he also looked at the trees in the American wilderness and found that the lines created by the vitality of the trees were different, but intersected harmoniously. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Every winter, he goes to see the dead lotuses on the West Lake. He has more than 20,000 photos of dead lotuses on his computer. Look at the dead lotus stems, all scattered and scattered, seemingly chaotic, but there is an underlying order in the chaos. When the ideographic nature of Chinese characters is completely covered up - like the enlarged Xu Wei that makes it difficult to see what character it is, then only the lines of the Chinese characters are left in front of the viewer&#39;s eyes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the history of calligraphy, the &quot;overlapping&quot; of characters can be traced back to Yan Zhenqing&#39;s &quot;Seat Struggle&quot;, but that may be unconscious. When it came to Xu Wei, &quot;I think his calligraphy was intended to break the line spacing,&quot; Wang Dongling said. Later, Zheng Banqiao&#39;s calligraphy was called &quot;paving the streets with random stones.&quot; &quot;In fact, they all wanted to break the calligraphy and line spacing.&quot; &quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Chaoshu&quot; is to push this &quot;break&quot; to the extreme. If you look at Wang Dongling&#39;s random writing process, every word he writes is actually in accordance with cursive writing (cursive, a calligraphy term, refers to the cursive writing rules of Chinese characters. The cursive writing of each character is roughly fixed and conventional). &quot;It&#39;s nothing more than an overlap.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When words overlap and strokes intertwine, the viewer cannot clearly see what is written. Therefore, the &quot;word barrier&quot; for Chinese people to read calligraphy is broken, and they can concentrate on feeling the lines. flow. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/15/A8S5wOWaeRQwSuOfYRqzliYcZV6WtpKzCLP7BfPV.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height= &quot;663&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/15/A8S5wOWaeRQwSuOfYRqzliYcZV6WtpKzCLP7BfPV.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250936&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In 2021, the 60-year exhibition of Wang Dongling&#39;s calligraphy art was held at Zhejiang Art Museum. The picture shows an audience staying in front of Wang Dongling&#39;s works. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For Chinese people, when they look at a piece of calligraphy, they first of course want to understand what it says. , in Wang Dongling&#39;s opinion, is a &quot;writing barrier&quot;, which keeps many ordinary people away from the deeper beauty of calligraphy. Just like someone listens to his mother tongue and understands the meaning, but unconsciously ignores the beauty of the pronunciation. Only people who do not understand the language at all will notice the high and low pitch values ​​and the gentleness of the timbre when listening. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Calligraphy has developed over thousands of years. Traditional calligraphy has been very perfect and mature. It is difficult for you to break through at all.&quot; Wang Dongling said that calligraphy has two attributes, one is cultural attribute, and the other is cultural attribute. It is Chinese characters written by Chinese people, so we naturally want to understand it, &quot;There is nothing wrong with this&quot;, but another attribute of calligraphy is its artistic attribute. If you admit that it is an art, then it must Have personality and express the creator.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Chaotic script is the extension of ancient cursive script.” This is Wang Dongling’s own understanding of chaotic script. He puts his creation into the track of the ancients, “Of course my heart is not as wild as Xu Wei’s. , but you must have passion to write cursive.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>; Can people who understand music learn calligraphy faster? &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Walking into Wang Dongling’s studio, the floor is covered with all kinds of manuscript papers, rice paper, and albums. It can be said to be a “street full of paper.” This studio has received many foreigners who admired Chinese calligraphy. &quot;Professor Wang Dongling gave me my first calligraphy lesson.&quot; In 2015, Apple CEO Tim Cook said on Weibo. At that time, Cook visited Wang Dongling&#39;s studio, and Wang Dongling taught him to use Apple pencil to write the word &quot;goodbye&quot; with calligraphy strokes on the iPad. Prior to this, he was invited to Apple headquarters in California to provide professional calligraphy advice on the iPad’s writing capabilities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For Apple, this Weibo undoubtedly has a strong marketing temperament, but Wang Dongling does not reject invitations from other cultures. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In March 1989, Wang Dongling went to give lectures at the University of Minnesota in the United States. What he brought with him was a large pen and the &quot;Longzang Temple Stele&quot; which he copied repeatedly. Wang Dongling still remembers the winter in Minnesota, when there was heavy snow outside the window, and his car was stuck deep in the snow, like an ink mark in the snow. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Dongling’s English is very poor. In his own words, when he first arrived in the United States, he didn’t know all 26 letters. So far, I may only recognize 200 words. But he is very willing to exchange calligraphy with foreigners. In 1981, Wang Dongling received a master&#39;s degree in calligraphy from Zhejiang Academy of Fine Arts (now China Academy of Art) and stayed at the school to teach. At that time, Zhejiang Academy of Fine Arts was the only school in the country that majored in calligraphy, so the Ministry of Culture sent all international students studying calligraphy to Zhejiang Academy of Fine Arts. From then on, Wang Dongling took on the task of teaching calligraphy to international students. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Even now, many people still feel that it is impossible to teach Westerners to learn calligraphy. They do not understand ancient Chinese, and learning Chinese characters does not happen overnight. But Wang Dongling&#39;s teaching practice told him that this does not seem to be the case. &quot;They often make mistakes in stroke order and structure, and even write wrong words. But this is not a problem.&quot; In Wang Dongling&#39;s view, foreigners have overcome the &quot;writing barrier&quot; from the beginning. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;British art historian Gombrich once concluded that the role of calligraphy in Chinese culture corresponds well with music in European culture. Wang Dongling&#39;s experience tells him that students who have previous musical accomplishments will learn faster. &quot;The form of cursive calligraphy art is a division of space by overflowing tension and irregular lines. This kind of space displayed after black and white treatment is full of changes in virtual reality and rhythm, and it is a musical space.&quot; Wang Dongling said . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Internet celebrity &quot;Teacher Andy&quot; of Bilibili, who is now over seventy years old, has been working tirelessly to popularize Western classical music to the public on the Chinese Internet in recent years. His full name is Andreas Stier. German, he is a piano professor at the Hamburg State University of Music. He was once a student of Wang Dongling. Wang Dongling still remembers that in the 1980s, he took Andy Shi and several other international students to the home of Mr. Lu Yanshao. Mr. Lu Yanshao read the works of several foreign students in turn and saw the &quot;Silence&quot; in the &quot;Taishan Diamond Sutra&quot; written by Andy Shi. &quot;Chinese people have not been able to write at this level for a long time.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1990, Wang Dongling was in the United States, watching various contemporary art and contemporary dances. Once, he watched an artistic performance by American middle school students. There were solo dances and group dances of three people. The children were twisting their bodies unscrupulously. &quot;Their body language made me feel that no matter how innovative Chinese calligraphy is, it should be allowed,&quot; he said. &quot;Wang Dongling said that graffiti, like dancing, is one of human instincts. &quot;The writing of Chinese characters has a strong graffiti nature. Calligraphy is a spiritual artistic product that combines human instincts with Chinese characters.&quot; And in Kuangcao. In &quot;Kang Cao&quot;, human instincts are released as much as possible. &quot;Kang Cao is greatly weakened from the constraints of ranks, providing a free world for the author to express space. In Kuang Cao, the writing, rhythm and rhythm of calligraphy are brought into full play.&quot; ”&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Traditional calligraphy, Jianghu style, modern calligraphy&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Although Wang Dongling looks thin, in the face of the physically demanding calligraphy, he can write the large-scale &quot;Thousand-Character Essay&quot; 》. It took four hours to write a random piece of &quot;The Thousand Character Essay&quot;. In Wang Dongling&#39;s own words, it was indeed improvised writing, but it was not a &quot;disordered accident, but a kind of muscle memory after years of training.&quot; And when writing, you should always pay attention to the connection between words and the overall layout. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Qi Gong once said, &quot;Layout is very difficult.&quot; Layout has also become one of the criteria that distinguishes professional calligraphers from calligraphy enthusiasts generally known as &quot;Jianghu style&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Wang Dongling&#39;s opinion, the current people who study calligraphy can be roughly divided into three types of people. One type is those who follow the traditional path, conscientiously write posts and monuments, and write &quot;good-looking&quot; characters according to traditional standards. This type of people is the cornerstone of calligraphy. The second category is the &quot;jianghu style&quot;. &quot;With the participation of all people now, there must be some people who are not good at basic skills but are eager for quick success and quick success. They attract people&#39;s attention but have no level. These people can be called &#39;jianghu style&#39;.&quot;&lt; /p>; &lt;p>;There are also some people who want calligraphy to become a breakthrough modern art. Not only are there people like Wang Dongling who are making breakthroughs within calligraphy, but there are also people who are combining calligraphy with contemporary art such as installation, performance, and video. Some of the &quot;ugly books&quot; considered by the public come from the Jianghu style, and a large number of them come from this group. Wang Dongling also makes no secret that he belongs to the third category. Although his daily training is the same as that of traditional calligraphers, he also has to write calligraphy every day. &quot;In the final analysis, modern calligraphy is to express people&#39;s emotions. I am a firm supporter of modern calligraphy and Promoter&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Few people know that the establishment of the first calligraphy major in China actually came from the influence of modern calligraphy. After World War II, Japan regarded calligraphy as an art, engaged in modern calligraphy and avant-garde calligraphy, and attached great importance to the popularization of calligraphy education. In the early 1960s, Pan Tianshou went to Japan to study calligraphy and was deeply moved. He returned to Hangzhou and founded China&#39;s first calligraphy and seal cutting major at the Zhejiang Academy of Fine Arts with Sha Menghai, Lu Weizhao and others. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1979, Zhejiang Academy of Fine Arts was commissioned by the Ministry of Culture to recruit the first master&#39;s degree students in calligraphy in the country. Wang Dongling became a student of Sha Menghai, Lu Weizhao and other gentlemen, and was one of the first five masters of calligraphy in New China. In the autumn of 1980, Wang Dongling accompanied Mr. Sha Menghai to Beijing to see the original stone drum exhibition at the Palace Museum. I have read Han Yu&#39;s &quot;Song of the Stone Drum&quot;, seen the original rubbings of &quot;The Inscriptions on the Stone Drum&quot;, and read Wu Changshuo&#39;s &quot;The Inscription on the Stone Drum&quot;, but when I saw the original copy of the Stone Drum, &quot;Even if I don&#39;t look at the specific words, the kind of text that the Stone Drum carries The atmosphere of ancient times makes people deeply moved. This experience is the same as looking at the statue in front of Huo Qubing&#39;s tomb, which is very wonderful.&quot; In Wang Dongling&#39;s own memories, this trip to Beijing brought a great shock to his artistic concept. &quot;I feel that the highest state of calligraphy is far from the stability and exquisiteness of pointillism. What is more important is that lines can carry abundant vitality and inexhaustible vitality.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the 1990s, Wang Dongling After returning to the United States, he began to devote himself to promoting and practicing modern calligraphy. Since then, he has been subjected to pressure and ridicule from all walks of life. At first, there were doubts from the professional calligraphy community. In recent years, the situation has reversed. The professional calligraphy community has turned to a positive evaluation of him, but the public in the Internet age has made an even harsher voice. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Dongling has some intuitive self-explanations to explain the creation process of chaos books to the public, such as Huai Su watching the peaks of summer with many strange clouds, Zhang Xu watching Gongsun Auntie dancing with a sword, Huang Tingjian watching the boatmen rowing, all enlightened He developed new calligraphy skills, and connected his random calligraphy with the residual lotus. When asked if this was an afterthought, he smiled and said, &quot;the two grew out of each other.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Like Zeng Xiang, the &quot;master of shouting&quot;, he likes to write big characters. When he writes, there are many onlookers - but Wang Dongling basically doesn&#39;t shout. When writing calligraphy, people are watching and cheering. This is also a tradition. When Zhang Xu writes cursive script, people often watch him. Jin Shengtan listed thirty-three joyful things in life, one of which is &quot;How wonderful it is to watch people write big books in a nest!&quot; He also hopes that people can enjoy calligraphy with the mood of &quot;It is wonderful&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Dongling supports the innovation of calligraphy as a modern art, but he seems quite hesitant about one question. A reporter from Southern Weekend asked him: &quot;Will the innovations of some young people with weak basic skills be successful?&quot; Will it be superficial? But if young people follow the tradition and practice to the state of &quot;old people and books&quot; as the ancients said, and then make innovations and breakthroughs, have they missed the best time in their lives? Is there any hidden meaning in this? Contradiction?&quot; For a person who is still enthusiastic about creation when he is nearly eighty years old, this may not be a problem. Wang Dongling paused for a long time and replied: &quot;Creation must have good basic skills. People with good basic skills should promote them. Create more.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 16 Sep 2023 09:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[“滑板女孩”“全盲男孩”，今年又有一批“特殊”的新生丨大学你好]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256706]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-16 08:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 16 Sep 2023 08:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[科学家揭开白牦牛身世之谜]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256560]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-15 23:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/12/YDftAEy1DozqWbBA5Ic9L9oxcFRw1J1ejVXro2pU.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/12/YDftAEy1DozqWbBA5Ic9L9oxcFRw1J1ejVX ro2pU. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250481&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>; (Visual China/Picture) &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Book of Mountains and Seas·Beishan Jing&quot; describes: &quot;On Panhou&#39;s Mountain... there is a beast, which looks like an ox and has hair on all four joints. It is called an ox.&quot; In ancient times, In Tibetan mythology, wild yaks are called &quot;stars&quot; in the sky, and white yaks are especially revered. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Putting aside the veil of mystery, where did the white yak come from in reality? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Both the black yak and the white yak are domesticated by humans from wild yaks. The wild yak is a first-level protected animal in China. Archaeologists have discovered bison and other ungulate fossils in the middle and late Pleistocene strata of the Quaternary about 3 million years ago. Wild yaks were once widely distributed in China. They can be seen everywhere in the Himalayas, Kunlun Mountains and Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. Nowadays, with human development, the distribution area of ​​wild yaks has rapidly shrunk and fragmented. They can only be found in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, mainly living in the Qiangtang National Nature Reserve in Tibet. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Domestic yaks were domesticated from wild yaks. From the past to the present, people have used molecular genetics knowledge, sequencing technology and other biological information methods to extract information from many species by combining morphological similarities with archaeological discoveries. This aspect reveals evidence of wild yak domestication. Professor Liu Jianquan from the School of Ecology of Lanzhou University constructed a complete yak genome structure variation map by studying the genome structure of 23 individuals of domestic yaks and wild yaks. He found that domestic yaks living in the alpine pastoral areas of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau at an altitude of 2,000-5,000 meters are descended from humans. It was domesticated 7,300 years ago from the wild yak that currently lives in the uninhabited area of ​​the northern plateau. At the same time, there are highly differentiated structural variations between domestic yaks and wild yaks, that is, structural variations that are subject to artificial selection during domestication. Domestication traits such as genes and nervous system development and behavior, as well as reproductive ability and immunity, are affected by selected structural variations. It is related to functions related to economic traits, providing a new perspective for understanding the genetic mechanism of yak domestication. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The latest survey results of the National Livestock and Poultry Resources Committee in 2019 show that domestic yaks include 17 local breeds and 2 cultivated breeds, distributed in Gansu, Qinghai, Xinjiang, Yunnan, Tibet and Sichuan, and are affected by various Affected by regional geographical conditions, these yak breeds have also formed distinctive local characteristics in the long-term evolution. The most scientifically troubling mystery about these different domestic yaks is the mystery of coat color, especially when and where the white yak was produced. Is the spotted yak the result of a cross between a white yak and a black yak, or a cross with other cattle? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Subsequently, Liu Jianquan’s team cooperated with researcher Yan Ping of the Lanzhou Institute of Animal Husbandry and Pharmacy of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences and other research groups. Through nearly 30 years of field sampling, they completed the sampling of all varieties of domestic yaks and more than 20 wild yaks. The yak was sampled and complete DNA was successfully extracted for genome analysis, thereby constructing a genome map of the Bovine species. Research has found that after domestication, domestic yaks were crossed with another type of cattle. Nearly 90% of domestic yaks have genomic structural variations from cattle, accounting for about 1%-5% of all genomic structural variations. Cattle were domesticated from bison in the Near East and the Indus River Basin, and were brought to the Tibetan Plateau by humans no more than 4,000 years ago. The relevant research results &quot;Evolutionary origin of genomic structural variations in domestic yaks&quot; were recently published in the international academic journal &quot;Nature Communications&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is the genetic introgression from cattle that leads to the key genetic basis for phenotypic variation in different breeds of domestic yak. In layman&#39;s terms, within about two thousand years, the domestic yak and the flowered yak produced the flowered yak due to active or passive interspecific hybridization during the grazing process, and the flowered yak then produced the white yak through genetic mutation. This solved the mystery of the &quot;white yak&quot; that has troubled the scientific community. In addition to unraveling scientific mysteries, this study provides a new perspective on the improvement of yak breeds. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Due to the closed breeding environment of yaks and the lack of communication between livestock species, as well as the impact of global climate change and the destruction of natural pastures by overgrazing, the living environment of yaks has deteriorated, and various yak breeds have developed different characteristics. degree of degradation. Therefore, hybrid improvement and breed selection of domestic yaks have become an important task. Although domestic yaks and wild yaks have varying degrees of differences in appearance, breeding methods, production performance and disease resistance, they are generally similar. The biggest difference is that wild yaks have significantly better disease resistance than domestic yaks. Respiratory diseases, parasitic diseases, pasteurellosis and other infectious diseases are common diseases in domestic yaks. Wild yaks are strong and resistant to stress. The weight and other indicators of the first generation of hybrid yaks bred using wild yaks are in line with the local conditions. Compared with domestic yaks of the same age, they were significantly enhanced. Existing research has found that the physique and meat production of domestic yaks in areas with wild yaks are significantly better than those in areas without wild yaks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yaks are an indispensable breed of cattle on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. In the future development of the yak industry, we should devote ourselves to the improvement and cultivation of domestic yaks, and use scientific research as technical support to deeply explore the genetic resource advantages of wild yaks. , vigorously improve the production performance of domestic yaks to bring greater economic benefits. As Professor Liu Jianquan said: &quot;In the era of gene editing and transgenics, interspecific hybridization should still be an important means of cultivating new varieties or even new species that adapt to climate change and human needs, but ideas and technologies must be innovative.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt; p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 15 Sep 2023 23:25:04 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[触目惊心，这国洪灾已致1.1万多人丧生]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256772]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-15 22:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Hurricane &quot;Daniel&quot; made landfall on the Mediterranean coast of eastern Libya on September 10 and caused floods in Derna, Bey Caused a large number of casualties in Da, Shehat and other places.
