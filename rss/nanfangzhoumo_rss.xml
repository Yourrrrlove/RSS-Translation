The so-called selling an official position to win a title has been around since ancient times, and history is endless. But what we are talking about here is not the behind-the-scenes operation in the house of cards, but the aboveboard state behavior. Starting from the Wei, Jin, Southern and Northern Dynasties, the government sometimes publicly sold official qualifications to solve financial difficulties. In the middle of the Ming Dynasty, Emperor Jingtai, who ascended the throne because his brother Yingzong was captured by the Mongols during the Civil War, put the qualifications of students from the Guozijian, the country&#39;s highest institution (historically known as &quot;Jiansheng&quot;) on the market for the first time, starting an epoch-making revolution. great changes. Because as long as the supervisory students pass a certain period of probation and do not receive negative reviews, they can obtain official qualifications. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although the Ming Dynasty&#39;s move was far ahead of the previous generation, it was nothing compared to the Qing Dynasty. The Ming Dynasty only allowed donations from prison students and did not dare to directly sell formal official positions. In the Qing Dynasty, for donations, Beijing officials could donate to doctors of the fifth rank, while foreign officials could only donate to Taoist priests of the fourth rank. The so-called heyday of Kangxi and Qianlong, that is, the two dynasties of Kangxi and Qianlong, were precisely the critical periods for the development of donations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Donations in the Qing Dynasty were divided into two types: &quot;current regulations&quot; and &quot;temporary regulations&quot;. The so-called &quot;current routine&quot; refers to the donations that are offered all year round, mainly to donations to supervising students. During the Qianlong period, the annual income from this was about 3 million taels, which was close to one-tenth of the agricultural tax, which was the main part of the fiscal revenue. The &quot;temporary cases&quot; are used to raise specific funds caused by major events such as military expenses, Yellow River management project expenses, disaster relief funds, etc. Temporary donations mainly sell actual official positions, so they are also called &quot;real official donations.&quot; Legally speaking, those who are eligible to report temporary donations are limited to current officials and supervisory students who already have official qualifications, and ordinary people are excluded. But in fact, if ordinary people want to buy an official position, they can first donate a prison student according to the current regulations, thus perfectly avoiding the restrictions. The income from temporary cases can reach tens of millions of taels at a time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Qing government’s donation information is open and transparent, prices are clearly marked, first come, first served, no one is deceived. There is no age limit for those who wish to donate. Newborn babies can also be donated to supervising children, or on this basis, they can donate to official positions. Because there are far more people qualified to hold official positions than there are bureaucratic positions, it is not possible to get an official position right away. You have to submit relevant documents from the Ministry of Personnel and wait in line to &quot;get on the train&quot; according to order. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Now that they have paid for it, everyone hopes to become a Shangguan as soon as possible and get back their capital and profits as soon as possible. This brought additional business opportunities to the Qing government. Donors could add &quot;tricks&quot; to their donation, that is, priority in appointments, which was equivalent to walking in the VIP channel when queuing. There are many types of products, such as &quot;first use&quot;, &quot;use in case of shortage&quot;, &quot;first use first&quot;, etc., which can be chosen by customers with different needs, all with clearly marked prices. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This transaction of the Qing government has undergone some interesting changes as time has passed. On the one hand, official positions are constantly on sale. For example, in the 39th year of Qianlong&#39;s reign (1774), the price of a Taoist was 16,400 taels. In the second year of Xianfeng&#39;s reign (1852), it was reduced to 9,446.4 taels, almost cut in half. By the 27th year of Guangxu&#39;s reign (1901), it only cost 4,732.1 taels, which was more than 30% off. Low. This is because more and more people are queuing up and the backlog is getting worse. For example, in the 19th year of Jiaqing (1814), in order to raise the cost of regulating the eastern Henan section of the Yellow River, the imperial court launched the &quot;Eastern Henan Case&quot;. However, the &quot;Sichuan-Chu Case&quot; 16 years ago, the &quot;Work Relief Case&quot; 13 years ago, and the &quot;Work Relief Case&quot; 11 years ago The &quot;work balance case&quot; before, the &quot;donation case&quot; 8 years ago, and the &quot;earth excavation case&quot; 6 years ago are all still not digested by people who buy government offices. In this case, waiting in line means that the time it takes for the investment to pay off is getting longer and longer. In order to attract new customers, in addition to lowering prices, the imperial court also invented the method of &quot;suppressing the old with the new&quot; (three new and one old, four new and one old, or even five new and one old). For the government, the temporary cases that have ended have already put money firmly into their pockets. Of course, they cannot turn their backs and abandon the consumers who paid for them and are still queuing up. However, in order to recruit new people, the interests of old customers are expendable. Therefore, in the 19th year of Jiaqing, the imperial court announced the implementation of &quot;four new and one old&quot;, that is, for every five vacant official positions reserved for donors, the first four were designated for the East Henan Province, and the fifth was assigned to many previous Persons left unresolved by the case. In these cases, priority is given not to the buyers of the earliest &quot;Chuanchu cases&quot; who paid, but to the consumers of the latest &quot;Tufang cases&quot;. The fifth vacancy, which was the first official position reserved for the old case, was assigned to the top remaining donor in the &quot;Earthwork Case&quot;. As for the &quot;Chuan Chu Case&quot; 16 years ago, the person who finally made it to the top of the team had to wait until the 45th position to take his turn. Until the first year of Xianfeng (1851), more than fifty years had passed since the opening of &quot;Chuanchu Case&quot;, and there were still customers queuing up. It is unknown how many people who were excited because of the opportunity to spend money to buy an official position passed away in the long years without waiting for their dreams to come true. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the other hand, as a VIP channel, the price of tricks is always strong. For example, in the &quot;Zhenggong Case&quot; in the 13th year of Guangxu&#39;s reign (1887), the magistrate&#39;s price was only 1,998 taels, which was half the price during the Qianlong period. However, the magistrate&#39;s &quot;Before the Deficiency&quot; trick required 3,808.8 taels, which was almost double the qualifications for the magistrate&#39;s appointment. . But the same goes for old tricks. For example, if the &quot;first in case of shortage&quot; purchased by &quot;Earthwork Case&quot; is still in the queue when the &quot;East Yun Case&quot; is implemented, its effectiveness will be greatly faded compared to the &quot;first in case of shortage&quot; in &quot;East Yu Case&quot;. In order to do everything possible to mobilize the enthusiasm of consumers and extract money from the hands of the people, the imperial court creatively designed an incentive mechanism of &quot;adding more money to pay for work&quot;. Assume that the magistrate of &quot;Earthwork Case&quot; &quot;in case of shortage&quot; sells for 5,000 taels, and the magistrate of &quot;Eastern Yudong Case&quot; needs &quot;in case of shortage&quot; for 7,000 taels. The person who originally bought the &quot;Earthwork Case&quot; in the county of &quot;in case of shortage&quot; can According to the standard of adding 30 taels for every one hundred taels, and paying an additional 2,100 taels as over-shift fee, you can be transferred to the &quot;first in line&quot; VIP channel of the magistrate of &quot;Eastern Yudong Case&quot; to queue up. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As a result, donors who have not bought anything actually have no hope of being ranked. At the end of the Qing Dynasty, &quot;pressing the old with the new&quot; also changed from sorting by new and old examples to sorting by new and old patterns. Moreover, the imperial court considered that no matter whether they bought an official position or passed the imperial examination in ten years, it was everyone&#39;s wish to become an official as soon as possible. Those who qualified for official positions through the imperial examination could also open a special channel as long as they were willing to spend money to buy tricks. In the late Guangxu Dynasty, the &quot;Selection of Wheels&quot;, which records the waiting list for county magistrates, contains more than 20 tricks, among which there are &quot;donating and accepting Jinshi first&quot; - a trick specially prepared for Jinshi to &quot;jump in line&quot;, and &quot;donating and accepting filial piety&quot;. &quot;Fangzhengxian&quot; - Xiaolian Fangzheng refers to a person who is qualified to serve as an official because of his outstanding conduct and special recommendation. If such a person does not spend money to buy tricks, no matter how he practices filial piety, no matter how upright his character is, I am afraid he will not be accepted. It&#39;s time to take the wheel. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to raise funds, there were still many links in the appointment process of officials in the Qing Dynasty that could be solved with money. At least since the Han Dynasty, people who have just entered the ranks of the bureaucracy may need a period of time as a transitional internship period. After the probation period is completed, they can be officially appointed. In the Qing Dynasty, an internship period ranging from one to three years was generally required before becoming an official for the first time. If you have money, you can donate to get a free trial. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When appointing officials in previous dynasties, there were regulations to avoid the place of origin and relatives&#39; official appointments, and the same was true in the Qing Dynasty. However, in the Qing Dynasty, donations could also be waived for avoidance. Even if you designate the province where you want to be an official, or if you are not satisfied with the province where you are appointed as an official and want to change it to another province, you can do it through donations (the former is called a province, and the latter is called changing a province). In the Qing Dynasty, some official positions were under the control of local governors. Candidates could only be appointed within the province. They could also donate a sum of money to leave the province and then donate to another province to switch to another province. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Officials appointed by the Ministry of Personnel, ranging from Taoist officials to Qipin Zhizhiguan magistrates (Taoist officials and above are appointed by the emperor), must appear before the emperor and be reviewed by the emperor himself (called an introduction, in fact Often just a formality) before being allowed to take office. As for junior officials such as junior deputies, who were not even close to sesame seeds, the emperor really did not have the time and energy to deal with them, so he commissioned the princes and ministers to check the appearance of each person (called inspection). The purpose of this was to show that the Qing monarch was &quot;arbitrary&quot; and &quot;all employing people, listening to words, and having great power without any excuse.&quot; But as long as you pay for it, introductions and inspections can be dispensed with - even if it&#39;s just for money, you don&#39;t need authority! &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to prevent donors from digging too much into the Qing Dynasty, it was originally stipulated that donors with backgrounds should not be recommended by local governors or central ministerial officials (that is, recommended, and the recommender is jointly and severally liable). He cannot serve as a capital official or local official (top leader). In the Qing Dynasty, they even risked their lives for money, and recommendations can also be donated! &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Except for those who are entering the official service for the first time, officials who have resigned due to illness and want to return to their original posts after recovering from illness will have to spend a sum of money to replace them immediately, otherwise they will have to wait in line. If you want to change a position, you have to make two investments, first donate to fill the original position, and then donate to replace the position. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The most amazing example is probably the &quot;temporary supervisor&quot;: &quot;Some people want to take the examination, but they are not qualified. By donating one supervisor, you can take the provincial examination, but if the supervisor can make a temporary donation in cash , it also requires dozens of taels of silver, and I am not sure whether it will be successful or not. I am a little reluctant to spend dozens of taels of silver in vain. Moreover, if all the procedures for this kind of donation to supervise students are completed, it will be possible. It took quite a while. So this temporary method was devised. First, a dozen or so taels of silver were handed over to the Imperial College, and the prison would issue a temporary supervisory license (commonly known as a supervisory license). With this license, you can Apply for the Provincial Examination in the Ministry of Rites. If you win the exam in the future, you will have to pay the full fee, and the prison will receive the official license. If you fail to pass, it will be considered as a matter of course, and you will make a cash donation until the next Provincial Examination.&quot; (Qi Rushan&#39;s &quot; Chinese family name&quot;)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/19/E9nBwpbi0PRujzZ6WJFwmdGjvoyB5H6l0WZ2LcK3.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width =&quot;549&quot; height=&quot;1222&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/19/E9nBwpbi0PRujzZ6WJFwmdGjvoyB5H6l0WZ2LcK3.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;258824&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Receipt stub from a donation to a prison student in the 17th year of Daoguang reign of the Qing Dynasty (1837). &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Information picture/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Donations are not only allowed in many aspects of examination qualifications, official qualifications and official appointment, but also after becoming an official Rewards and punishments are due based on performance - if you do well, you can be promoted, if you do poorly, you will be punished - or you can pay for it. In order to open up financial avenues, starting from the Kangxi Dynasty, not only current officials could donate money to be promoted, but also those waiting in line at the Ministry of Civil Service for appointment could donate money in advance. For example, in the Yimao donation in the 14th year of Kangxi&#39;s reign (1675), a candidate for the county magistrate (deputy of the county magistrate) could pay 300 taels for &quot;first use&quot;, or he could spend 1,000 taels to donate to the county magistrate&#39;s official qualifications. If he was willing to pay an additional 500 taels You can directly enter the &quot;first use&quot; VIP channel of the county magistrate. This system is unique to the Qing Dynasty. After current officials spend money to buy promotion qualifications, they can theoretically queue up at the Ministry of Civil Affairs only after their current term of office expires. Considering that this would dampen the enthusiasm of consumers, the Qing government also launched the donation of resignation, so that as long as you pay for it, you can leave immediately. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;You can use money to get a promotion, you can be punished for dereliction of duty, or you can spend money to eliminate disasters. In the Qing Dynasty, depending on the content and degree of the fault committed by an official, there were three types of punishment: fine, demotion, and dismissal. Under normal circumstances, only “set-off” or “recovery” can reduce or reduce the penalty. The so-called &quot;offset&quot; refers to officials using the rewards they receive to offset punishment. There are two types of awards: &quot;Additional Level&quot; and &quot;Record&quot;. &quot;Additional one level&quot; or four &quot;records&quot; can be used to offset the penalty of downgrading by one level. &quot;The second record will offset the penalty for one year, and the first record will offset the penalty for half a year.&quot; &quot;Rehabilitate&quot; means that the punishment can be lifted after a certain period of time if the person behaves well. For example, the reinstatement period for those who were demoted and retained in office is three years, and the period for those who were dismissed and retained in office is four years. If you perform meritorious services during this period, you may be reinstated in advance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Both &quot;Additional Levels&quot; and &quot;Records&quot; can be purchased publicly for money. However, the Qing Dynasty stipulated that for the &quot;increased level&quot; or &quot;record&quot; of donations to be used for offset, the payment must have been received before the disciplinary incident was reported. If you go to buy something after being punished, it will be too late. Therefore, before officials took office, they donated Naga level and records. Beginning in the 14th year of Kangxi&#39;s reign, officials were allowed to directly spend money to cancel the punishment after being punished. All officials who have been demoted and retained in office, or dismissed and retained in office (remaining in their original posts after being demoted or dismissed), except for a few exceptions, can donate to reinstatement officers. Officials who should have been demoted (reassigned work according to the downgraded grade) or dismissed, but who were retained in office due to leniency orders, can pay a 50% increase in salary upon reinstatement. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to donating to restore the official position, you can also donate to restore the position corresponding to the grade of the original official. This is called &quot;replacement donation&quot;. Retired officials can also donate to a position lower than the original official, which is called &quot;reduced donation&quot;. After the donation is made, there is still an opportunity to donate again to reinstate the official or change the donation, which is equivalent to payment in installments. Officials who have been dismissed from their posts, even if they are &quot;never employed&quot;, can still become officials again through donations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Similar to buying an official position, donating money is clearly marked with a clear price and is straightforward. The price of being demoted and staying in office, from the first to the seventh rank, is twice that of a Beijing official. For example, a first-rank Beijing official is 450 taels, and a second-rank official is 410 liang. A first-rank foreign official is 900 liang, and a second-rank official is 820 liang. The eighth and ninth grades are subject to the unified price of Beijing and foreign officials. The price of donations for those who were dismissed and retained in office was not only much higher, but also more detailed. For the same grade, officials in the capital charged higher prices than officials in foreign countries. For officials who are demoted, transferred or dismissed, the price can be doubled compared to those who were demoted and retained or dismissed. In addition, depending on the specific circumstances of different officials, there is a complex price increase mechanism, ranging from an increase of 20% (20%) to an increase of one and a half times (150%). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the end of the Qing Dynasty, due to widespread financial difficulties in local areas, the imperial court often allowed each province to set up local donations. This resulted in an unintended consequence - inter-provincial competition. In order to expand revenue as much as possible, each province not only accepts donations from residents of other provinces living in the province, but also sets up donation bureaus (sales offices) in major cities outside the province to drum up business, even at the expense of small profits but quick turnover, &quot;reduced (discounted) donations&quot; , starting a price war. At one point, Sichuan and other provinces protested against &quot;dumping&quot; by Gansu and Shaanxi and demanded that the central government prohibit people from their provinces from going to other provinces to report donations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Ciming, a famous scholar in the late Qing Dynasty and a native of Zhejiang, went to the Fujian Donation Bureau to apply for donations in the ninth year of Xianfeng (1859). The price was 9684 taels, and the actual receipt was 815 taels, which was less than 10%. This is a common practice in various provinces: &quot;Henan Province takes rate notes (notes issued by the Ministry of Household Affairs to settle military arrears) and adds 10% in cash, which is about 20%. Huguang, Sichuan, and Zhejiang account for about 10%. The third. Jiangxi and Guangxi account for about three-tenths of the tenths. Yunnan and Guizhou account for about two-tenths. Anhui fully collects rates, accounting for about one-tenth. The remaining provinces do not have more than 30%.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p >;In Chengdu at the end of the Qing Dynasty, in addition to the Sichuan Relief Bureau (disaster relief) in the province, there were also the Xinhai Defense Donation Bureau (organizing the navy), the Feng (Liaoning) Donation Bureau, the Gui Donation Bureau, the Jiangnan Donation Bureau, and the Shandong Works Relief Donation Bureau (raising funds for Work-relief funds) and the Beiyang Salary and Donation Bureau (Beiyang Military Salary), etc. At that time, newspapers had just been born, and due to fierce competition, some discerning donation bureaus had already learned to publish advertisements. In this situation where there are many donation bureaus and a mixture of good and bad, there is also a phenomenon that some people conduct credit evaluations on different donation bureaus in publicly issued books. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Because there are so many types of tricks and there are so many donation bureaus, most people are easily confused, so an intermediary agency was born that specializes in handling donations, with a commission of about 10%. Many gold shops have &quot;transformed into a gathering place for donors and introductions&quot; and have dedicated &quot;donation counters&quot; to handle donations. Gold shops with donation counters are called &quot;public gold shops&quot;, while gold shops without donation counters are called &quot;mother gold shops&quot;. There will be competition among gold shops, and they will also use various means to deceive customers, which is no different from today&#39;s real estate agencies. Everyone knows the prosperity of Shanxi banknotes in the late Qing Dynasty, but few people have noticed that agency donations are one of the keys to the great development of Shanxi banknotes.

According to the Anhui Radio and Television Economic Life Channel, a 4-year-old boy in Hefei, Anhui, Wang Zien, had no one to take care of him and played alone on the street all day long. In order to settle Wang Zien&#39;s residence, the child&#39;s father, 18-year-old Wang, finally showed up. He said that he was only 14 years old when Wang Zien was born, and the child&#39;s mother was 20 years old at the time. The two parties broke up a few months after the child was born, and there has been no contact. He had to leave the child to his father to raise. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the incident broke out, public opinion mainly focused on Wang giving birth to a child before the age of 14. He was still a child, which was too irresponsible, and the mother of the child was more likely to be suspected of abandoning the child. A lawyer interviewed by the media said that the mother should fulfill her parenting obligations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These angles cannot be said to be meaningless, but they obviously miss the point. The crux of the problem should be that boys&#39; sexual rights are not protected. According to Wang, he was only 14 years old when the child was born (I don’t know whether he was one year old or not, even if he was one year old, Wang was probably still under 14 years old when they had sex), and the child’s mother was 20 years old. It can be inferred that when having sexual relations, Wang was most likely under 14 years old, while the mother of the child was over 18 years old. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What will happen if the genders are reversed and an 18-year-old man has sex with a girl under 14? I&#39;m afraid online public opinion has already exploded. According to the criminal law, sexual relations with a girl under the age of 14, regardless of whether the girl &quot;consented&quot;, will be severely punished as rape. If the circumstances are serious or cause serious consequences, the death penalty may also be imposed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, when the genders are reversed and adult women have sex with underage men, the situation becomes very embarrassing. The crime of rape cannot be applied because China&#39;s criminal law stipulates that the victim of rape can only be a female. Even if a man is forced to have sex, the other party does not commit the crime of rape. If the boy is under 14 when he is violated, he can be punished as child molestation. However, the penalty for this crime is only a fixed-term imprisonment of less than 5 years. Even if there are bad circumstances or serious consequences, the maximum sentence can only be 15 years in prison. This is not the same as the punishment for rape. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If the male victim is over 14 years old, he is no longer a child. Even if he is forcibly violated, criminal law cannot protect his rights. More importantly, in reality, if a minor male has sexual relations with a female, if the other party is an adult, judicial practice will not consider the male&#39;s sexual rights to have been violated. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is obviously abnormal. Minor males should receive the same protection as minor females. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Quite coincidentally, a case of an adult female teacher sexually assaulting an underage male student recently broke out in Taiwan. Xu, a female teacher who works as a fifth- and sixth-grade primary school teacher, repeatedly sexually assaulted a boy under the age of 14 in her class. She eventually became pregnant and gave birth to a child. The crime was later reported. The judge recently ruled that Xu was guilty of sexual intercourse and forced intercourse with a man under the age of 14, and sentenced her to 17 years and six months in prison. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Analyzing this case, we can find the differences between Taiwan’s criminal laws and mainland criminal laws. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First of all, having sex with a man against his will also constitutes the crime of rape (called &quot;forced intercourse&quot; in Taiwan). According to the criminal regulations revised in Taiwan in 1999, &quot;Men and women who have sexual intercourse by force, coercion, intimidation, hypnosis or other methods against their will shall be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of not less than 3 years but not more than 10 years.&quot; In this case, The judge determined that the female teacher surnamed Xu had sex with a male student twice against the male student&#39;s will, so it constituted a crime of forced intercourse. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Secondly, as long as you have sexual intercourse with a child under the age of 14, even if the child is voluntary, it still constitutes a crime (Article 227 of the Criminal Code of Taiwan, &quot;Any person who has sexual intercourse with a man or woman under the age of 14 shall be punished with 3 to fixed-term imprisonment of not less than 10 years but not more than 10 years”). In the above-mentioned case, the judge held that the female teacher named Xu had sexual intercourse with male students on seven other occasions. Although the boys were consenting, Xu&#39;s use of the girl still constituted the crime of sexual intercourse with men under the age of 14. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, Taiwan’s criminal regulations also equally protect the sexual rights of minors of men and women over 14 years old but under 16 years old. “Anyone who has sexual intercourse with a man or woman over 14 years old but under 16 years old shall be sentenced to a fixed-term imprisonment of not more than 7 years.” &quot;. That is to say, having sexual relations with minors between the ages of 14 and 16 is also a crime, but the penalty is lighter than having sexual relations with children under 14 years old. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In mainland criminal law, the protection of men’s sexual rights is much weaker. The sexual rights of minor males over 14 years old (let alone adult males) are not protected by criminal law, and the sexual rights of boys under 14 years old can only be protected by the much weaker crime of child molestation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is another point in Taiwan’s criminal laws that we can learn from, that is, multiple crimes can be punished based on the number of crimes committed, and they can be punished simultaneously. In the above-mentioned case, the judge found that Xu had sex with male students nine times. Although they were only divided into two categories, she was still convicted of nine crimes, and finally she was punished for several crimes. In the mainland legal system, only different crimes will be regarded as multiple crimes, the same crime will be classified as one crime, and the number of crimes will only be used as a reference for sentencing. This may result in a lighter sentence. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Looking back at history, before Taiwan revised its criminal laws in 1999, the victims of rape could only be women. If a man was sexually assaulted, the perpetrator could only be held accountable for indecent assault. However, Taiwan revised the relevant regulations more than 20 years ago to provide equal protection for the sexual rights of men and women. This is something the mainland can learn from. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 20 Nov 2023 19:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[黑龙江大庆市肇州发生火灾，致7人死亡]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260964]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-20 19:09:39&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;span>;The reporter learned from the People’s Government of Zhaozhou County, Daqing City, Heilongjiang Province that at 14:00 on November 20, 2023 At 04:00, the county fire brigade received an alarm that a fire broke out in a single-story steel structure simple board house of an individual industrial and commercial household in the south of Shizi Street, Fengle Town, Zhaozhou County.

It receives around 1 million tourists a year, many of them Asians, &quot;who turn Hallstatt into an important stopover&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Chen Chen remembered that one time, when he was taking pictures of a house, a local suddenly rushed out the door angrily and shouted at Chen Chen, telling him to go away quickly, otherwise he would call the police. &quot;Locals have had enough of large, noisy, disruptive tour groups.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On August 27, 2023, residents took to the streets and blocked tunnels and main roads leading to the entrance to the town. Trying to draw attention to the problem of overtourism. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The roads in the Austrian town are very narrow and crowded with people. Even the restaurants where you eat have long queues. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Chen Chen felt that not only was the restaurant’s service speed slow, but its attitude towards tourists was not very good either. &quot;Indifferent&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the mountain behind the small town of Hallstatt, there is a historic salt mine. Many foreign tourists come to this internet celebrity check-in place. But to take a small train up the mountain, Chen Chen couldn&#39;t wait in line, &quot;because there were too many people.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is not easy to take pictures in the mountains. &quot;We take advantage of every crack, and the queue order is not particularly good.&quot; Chen Chen said that as a photographer, if there are too many passers-by in the shot, he can only change the perspective or rely on post-production to process the pictures. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Too many tourists have also brought about some derivative problems, such as garbage visible everywhere.” Chen Chen believes that the uncivilized behavior of many foreign tourists will arouse the resentment of local people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After staying in the Austrian town for half a day, Chen Chen went to another town next door and found that the contrast was obvious. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;It was a very unknown town. It was very quiet, with few tourists. There was only one restaurant in the town.&quot; Chen Chen said that when I went there, the restaurant was full of locals dining. The elderly couple patted the empty seat next to them, indicating that Chen Chen could sit down. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Chen Chen found that the local people&#39;s lives were very leisurely. They got up late in the morning and everyone had a relaxed expression. The elderly couple said that they don&#39;t like too many tourists because they are too noisy, so they have been living in this quiet town. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to the Austrian town, a travel blogger also uploaded some street graffiti in Barcelona, ​​Spain on his social media account. The alleys in the neighborhood were almost covered with the words &quot;Tourists go back to their own homes&quot; The slogan was accompanied by the text &quot;In August, the European tourist season, Barcelona is so crowded that you can&#39;t even walk in the alleys.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Such posts quickly aroused a lot of discussion. Lining, a netizen from Spain, explained in the comment area that the slogans sprayed by people in Barcelona are mainly aimed at tourists from Northern Europe. &quot;They party wildly, drink heavily, and urinate everywhere. The streets are always dirty.&quot; Lining said that local Barcelona people had to move out because of this. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Media reports said that in protest, residents of the village of Hallstatt also erected a wooden barrier in the town, blocking the view of the Alps. However, the barrier was later removed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Previously, the mayor of Hallstatt had promised to reduce the number of tourist buses entering the town, but the problem of overtourism persists. Residents are demanding a limit on the number of visitors per day and a curfew on tour buses, which are also not allowed into the city after 5 p.m. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On online social media platforms, many netizens express their understanding of the anti-tourist behavior of international Internet celebrities. They believe that excessive tourists have indeed squeezed the living space of local residents and affected their living environment. It has also increased prices around the scenic area. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“This is a very normal reaction.” Zhou Zhao, head of the European Department of Shenzhen Vanzhong Cultural Tourism, said that international tourism is a “love-hate relationship” for local residents. Love is that tourists can drive the local economy, but hate is that too many tourists will affect the lives of local people. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;&quot;Ultimately make more money from tourists&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Fuzi is a freelance photographer, 2023 I started living in Bali in early September of this year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Bali is more than a thousand kilometers away from Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia, and is separated from Java Island by only a 3.2-kilometer-wide strait. It covers an area of ​​about more than 5,000 square kilometers. It is the most famous tourist and leisure area in Indonesia. Many travel magazines have voted it &quot;one of the most enchanting holiday destinations in the world&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“The prices of accommodation and food in Bali have increased now,” Fuzi said. In the past, you could rent a large suite with a swimming pool for 2,000 to 3,000 yuan per month in Bali, with good decoration and beautiful scenery. . But after the epidemic is relaxed, you can only rent a single room at a similar price. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Even most restaurants have increased their prices. In the past, for 100 RMB per person, you could have a good Western meal in a restaurant with a nice environment, but now it costs at least 150 RMB. The starting price of a motorcycle has more than doubled from three to four yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhou Zhao told Southern Weekend reporters that for popular foreign tourist cities, it is generally necessary to book hotels about two months in advance, and prices have increased by about 30% on average compared to before the epidemic. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to Bali Province’s tourism statistics, from November 2022 to January 2023, Bali Province welcomed nearly 1 million foreign tourists. According to data released by the Chinese Consulate General in Denpasar, Indonesia, Bali Province receives about 40% of foreign tourists visiting Indonesia. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Due to the nature of her work, Fuzi often has to go out for filming. He bought a motorcycle, but there are often traffic jams on the road in Canggu, sometimes even for thirty or forty minutes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“The road is very narrow, with a car in the middle and motorcycles jammed on both sides.” Fuzi told Southern Weekend reporters that tourists and locals overlapped, and some traffic jams also caused dust, causing the air to be dirty. good. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/20/6ff705530e.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;1440&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/20/6ff705530e.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;258864&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color : #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;A short and narrow road, sometimes even It will take thirty or forty minutes. (Fuzi/Picture)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the car rental fees for foreign tourists in Bali have also increased. In the past, you could rent a motorcycle for 300 yuan, but now it costs 500 yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhou Zhao said that this year, as the energy supply of most countries has been affected by the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, prices such as fuel, gas, and electricity are rising, and travel costs have increased. Therefore, some outbound tour group fees It is more expensive due to this reason. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, for Fuzi, the longer he stays in Bali, the more his favorability decreases. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The gap between the rich and the poor in Bali is large, and some people who rely on tourism have inspired others&#39; desire for money. After the epidemic was relaxed, many people who had houses at home opened B&amp;Bs or shops. In the past, Fuzi felt that most people in Bali were &quot;simple&quot;, but now they are more &quot;commercial&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In May of this year, a piece of news about “you need to make a reservation one year in advance if you want to travel to Bali” attracted the attention of the international community. The source is a report from an Indonesian news website that the tourist resort island of Bali plans to impose restrictions on foreign tourists. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Subsequently, Bali Governor Wayan explained to the media that the restrictive measures were implemented mainly to prevent some foreign tourists from staying in the local area on tourist visas and illegally doing business or looking for jobs after running out of money on vacation. In addition, with the recovery of tourism after the epidemic and the arrival of large-scale tourists, some illegal and disrespectful behaviors have also appeared, &quot;causing Bali residents to feel uneasy.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For this plan, Fuzi thinks it is &quot;difficult to implement.&quot; Because in Bali, &quot;money is king.&quot; He said that both the government and the people of Bali want to develop the economy. The so-called &quot;application restrictions&quot; are only a minor problem as long as the money is available. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fuzi said that even if it is implemented, prices will not fall back to normal levels. &quot;Because these policies are essentially screening tourists and selecting tourists with better and more stable financial capabilities.&quot; Fuzi believes that in this way, tourists can make more money. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the following month, Ayu Martini, Indonesia’s Deputy Minister of Tourism and Creative Economy, said that as of now, no reservation is required for Bali travel, and Indonesia’s visa policy has not changed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to relevant plans previously formulated by the Indonesian government, Indonesia strives to receive 3.5 million to 7.4 million international tourists in 2023, and the foreign exchange revenue from the tourism industry will reach at least 2.07 billion US dollars. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;“The key lies in passenger flow management”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;When Taiwanese youth Chen Zhiwei went to Venice for the first time, In addition to admiring the cityscape, he was also surprised by the number of tourists. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“You can see faces from different countries everywhere in the local area.” Chen Zhiwei said that the most common means of transportation on Venice Island is buses and boats, and each boat is always full of people. &quot;From morning to night.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Venice, this beautiful city known as the &quot;City on the Water&quot;, is located on the Adriatic Sea in northeastern Italy.

(Yao Jiatong/Photo)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, conflicts occur from time to time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Once, when Chen Zhiwei was visiting Pisa, he was told at the train station that the last train was temporarily cancelled. Since hundreds of locals and foreign tourists were stranded at the scene, the train station sent a return bus, but it could only accommodate 40 people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At first, the staff allowed tourists with children to get on the bus first, but this quickly aroused the dissatisfaction of locals who could not get on the bus. They complained that it was all due to too many tourists, causing even the bus to run out of time. Can&#39;t sit down. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Many locals surrounded the bus and refused to let the driver drive away.” Chen Zhiwei said that who got on the bus and who stayed behind became the fuse of conflicts. After physical conflicts broke out between locals and tourists, many police officers were deployed to resolve the issue. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the end, many tourists, including Chen Zhiwei, could only stay overnight at the train station and wait for the train the next morning. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On September 13, 2023, Venice announced a policy that starting in the spring of 2024, tourists entering the city during peak periods will need to pay 5 euros (approximately 39 yuan). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Previously, the Venetian government hoped that the money could be used to improve residents&#39; facilities and infrastructure. They &quot;had to deal with overflowing bins&quot; and rubbish thrown on the streets by tourists. At its peak, the number of foreign tourists outnumbered locals by about five times. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Chen Zhiwei is accustomed to things like &quot;taxation&quot;. For example, when staying in a hotel, many hotels charge a &quot;city tax&quot;, which is usually two or three euros a day, and it will be shown on the bill. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;After the money is collected, it will actually be used to help maintain the city and deal with problems arising from tourism.&quot; Chen Zhiwei said that it is reasonable for foreign tourists to bear some maintenance costs while traveling. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;External public opinion believes that excessive tourism has caused many locals to leave their hometowns. The introduction of taxes and fees such as &quot;tourism tax&quot; can offset harmful effects such as waste resource pollution. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/20/88eac1abe8.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/20/88eac1abe8.JPG&quot; data-key=&quot;258866&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Many netizens complained on social platforms that the difficulty of parking at international celebrity tourist attractions is a thorny issue.

Locals told him that the purpose of this was to prevent tourists and homeless people from sleeping on the benches and reduce their stay in public areas. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Like Venice, Croatia has introduced &quot;rules&quot; or instructions for tourists to prevent unruly behavior related to drinking. This includes requirements for appropriate attire in historic areas, prohibitions on alcohol consumption and gathering in public places where alcohol is prohibited. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ina Rodin, director of North America at the Croatian National Tourist Board, said a code of conduct is a way of informing visitors of acceptable behavior at a destination. &quot;But compliance is often limited.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/20/043a1631e0.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;1620&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/20/043a1631e0.JPG&quot; data-key=&quot;258867&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Many places set &quot;rules&quot; or instructions to prevent unruly behavior.

Resolve differences peacefully, avoid escalation of the situation, and take practical and effective measures to ensure security and stability on the China-Myanmar border. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On November 8, the Myanmar National Governing Council (junta) held a meeting of the National Defense Committee. The Commander-in-Chief of the Myanmar Army, General Min Aung Hlaing, made it clear at the meeting that the attack launched by the Kokang Allied Forces was intended to retake the Kokang. control and regain the benefits of drug production and trafficking, while its allies, the Ta&#39;ang Army and the Kachin Independence Army, also have their own political goals. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Chaos in northern Myanmar, the impact of &quot;making quick money&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Northern Myanmar has been in a state of war for a long time, with a large number of ethnic minority local armed forces, Myanmar government forces and minorities recruited by the government forces. The militia groups transformed from ethnic local armed forces are fighting with each other. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although the main contradiction exists between the local armed forces of ethnic minorities and the government forces, under certain circumstances, some ethnic minority armed forces will cooperate with the government forces to a certain extent to target other ethnic minority armed forces. ; In some cases, the militia groups recruited by the government forces will turn against the government forces again, so that on the one hand, the government forces need to rely on the support of the militia groups as local people to deal with the local militias; on the other hand, they also maintain a high degree of vigilance against the militia groups, everywhere Limit it to prevent it from getting too big. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The causes of Myanmar’s civil war are long-standing and complex. This involves the need to face the ethnic chieftain system left over from the feudal dynasty in the construction of the Myanmar nation-state, as well as the British colonists&#39; political tactics of strengthening support for ethnic chieftains and countering the majority Bamar ethnic group. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What cannot be ignored is that in the 1960s, after launching a coup and seizing state power, Commander-in-Chief of the Myanmar Army Ne Win adopted an impatient attitude in building a nation-state and tried to divide the national identity into three Sixty-nine and so on, forcibly promoting the assimilation of ethnic minorities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the area where ethnic minorities occupy nearly half of Myanmar’s territory, dozens of ethnic minorities who have lived here for generations suddenly became second- and third-class citizens overnight, and even their national identity cannot be guaranteed. What they lose is not only political rights, but also the most basic land property rights. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To this day, this attitude of &quot;the land is important but not the people&quot;, which has not been completely changed, is the most fundamental reason for the armed resistance of ethnic minorities in northern and southeastern Myanmar. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Myanmar is not a developed country, and areas inhabited by ethnic minorities such as northern Myanmar are even more remote and underdeveloped. The long-term consumption of war has completely complicated the problem. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although the Burmese Army recognizes the legitimacy of their political status, in reality, the Burmese Army’s military expenditures are not generous, and the supply of their weapons, equipment and personnel costs is basically better than nothing, which often leads them to “use drugs” &quot;Raise the Army&quot; route. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Burmese army often adopts a indulgent attitude towards this. If controls are strengthened, it is easy for the vigilante groups to rebel again and become local militants. If the vigilante group collapses immediately, he will also lose a powerful arm. Therefore, this delicate balance is also an important reason for the rampant criminal activities in northern Myanmar. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Due to the shortage of military funds, the income of the military and police at the grassroots level of the Myanmar government is too low. At the beginning of 2021, a &quot;nest case&quot; occurred in Tachileik, a city in northern Myanmar, in which some military and police collaborated to shelter drug trafficking. For this reason, Myanmar The military government had to make major changes to the local military and police departments. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The huge profits of drugs are also the reason why the &quot;alternative cultivation&quot; model that the international community once seriously promoted has made occasional progress in northern Myanmar, but has always had little effect. If we can find another way to &quot;make quick money&quot; that is not so eye-catching to the world and is as profitable as the drug trade, this will be quite attractive to various ethnic groups. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Therefore, in the past ten years, when &quot;online gambling&quot; was hit hard again, it quickly turned into widespread electronic fraud. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Today, on the one hand, the Kokang Allied Forces will indeed deal a heavy blow to the electronic fraud problem in northern Myanmar; on the other hand, it may also make the future situation in Myanmar more complicated. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Each one has his or her own agenda&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Although the Kokang area is only a tiny corner of the country compared to the whole of Myanmar, judging from the scope of this war, it is obviously beyond The scope of boldness. Not to mention that the direct goal of the Allied Forces is to regain control of the Kokang region. As allies of the Allied Forces, the Ta&#39;ang Army, Arakan Army, People&#39;s Protection Army (PDF) and Kachin Army, their demands are obviously not to combat electronic fraud. But for its own benefit. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Ta&#39;ang Army is fighting for a controlled area around Muse City in Myanmar, and may be able to achieve a status similar to today&#39;s Wa State in the future; the Arakan Army and the Kachin Army are pursuing in Rakhine State and Kachin State to establish an independent country; and the People&#39;s Protection Army (PDF)&#39;s primary goal is to overthrow the military regime throughout Myanmar...&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If the Allied Forces recapture Kokang, it may become a landmark event, prompting other civilian armed organizations to Political desires are rising again. In addition to the civilian armed organizations that have not signed the &quot;Nationwide Ceasefire Agreement&quot; with the Burmese army, other organizations that have signed the agreement and even those that have accepted the reorganization of the Burmese army into &quot;border defense battalions&quot; may again There is a change of situation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is undeniable that the current relative strength gap between the Myanmar Army and the above-mentioned organizations is the biggest driving force for them to unite and cooperate in combat. There is no doubt that this has indeed caused considerable pressure on the Myanmar Army. It is worth noting that the political demands of various local armed forces and the People&#39;s Protection Army vary greatly. In the future, internal conflicts may escalate and become prolonged. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If a long-term and large-scale war breaks out in Myanmar, not only may traditional security issues such as the dispersion of weapons and the impact of refugee waves occur, but also if the De&#39;ang Army occupies the Muse Port, and considering that the Qingshui River Port has been captured by the Allied Forces, The land trade channel between China and Myanmar will be greatly affected. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;More importantly, the consumption of war will inevitably stimulate the recurrence of certain phenomena in the &quot;feeding the army with poison&quot;, &quot;feeding the army with gambling&quot; and the current &quot;feeding the army with fraud&quot; that civilian armed groups originally relied on. It may have reared its head, or it may have turned to other more novel models of &quot;black and gray industries&quot; again, causing more complex security issues. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some local armed groups in northern Myanmar are likely to cause some hidden worries. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First of all, the phenomenon of &quot;large mixed settlements&quot; of various ethnic groups in northern Myanmar is very common, which will undoubtedly cause them to fall into a series of problems in terms of territory and population management, creating hidden dangers of future conflicts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Secondly, the natural and human conditions in northern Myanmar are quite limited. If these areas become independent, it will be difficult to form pillar industries other than minerals, and they lack financial self-sustainability. Even if a legal government is established, its stability There will be problems with the country and social governance capabilities. Coupled with the presence of a large number of cross-border ethnic groups in the region, domestic conflicts may eventually spill over and affect regional stability. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Finally, the consequences of a divided Myanmar may seriously affect regional stability. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Can it be &quot;crushed&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In the past, the reason why the Burmese army was able to crush ethnic armed groups was mainly due to its size and resource advantages in the Burmese areas. , the only obstacle that is not easy to overcome is the geographical situation of civilian areas. This advantage has been greatly weakened after the &quot;2.1 coup&quot; in 2020. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The NLD government has a very strong appeal in Myanmar, especially within the Bamar ethnic group. The coup of the Burmese army caused serious divisions within the Bamar ethnic group and seriously weakened the Burmese army&#39;s war sustainability. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Only from a comparison of military strength, the Burmese army can theoretically increase its troops on a large scale in northern Myanmar to solve the danger of the siege of Kokang. However, the current large-scale increase of troops itself will bring considerable risks to the Burmese army. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In areas dominated by the Bamar ethnic group, the People&#39;s Protection Army is already spreading everywhere. Once heavy troops move north to the empty hinterland of Myanmar, how can they not seize this opportunity? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If the Burmese army adopts measures such as mobilizing reserves to expand its army first and then move north, there will also be several obstacles: not only will it make the already poor financial situation further difficult, but it may also allow the Baojun and other pro-NLD forces to further infiltrate Within the Tatmadaw, causing more trouble. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If the Burmese army passively accepts the reality, it will first severely damage the personal prestige of the Burmese army leader. After all, the political capital that started his career was the decisive solution to the Peng Jiasheng armed forces in the &quot;8.8 Incident&quot;; the top brass of the Burmese army If there are changes, it will inevitably have a greater impact on Myanmar&#39;s overall political situation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What decision the top brass of the Myanmar military will ultimately make is obviously a question worthy of attention. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For Myanmar, in the future, the Myanmar Army may be able to reach a certain compromise with the ethnic armed groups through political negotiations, and then turn around and focus on targeting the People&#39;s Protection Army. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, the reverse may also be true. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Burmese army and the NLD forces reached a compromise, and the People&#39;s Protection Army gradually fell silent. The Burmese army was free to suppress the local armed forces back to the previous state. This could result in a long period of largely barely stable Myanmar, punctuated by minor conflicts. This is also a tragedy for Myanmar itself, which means that the Myanmar people have to endure more pain, but it is better than the situation of the country being divided and losing its autonomy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is another result, which is less likely but still exists, that is, after the Burmese people achieve internal reconciliation, the Burmese army will finally rely on its own size advantage to completely suppress the local armed forces within a certain period of time, at least Unifying the mountains and rivers in form. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the future, the autonomy of ethnic groups in northern Myanmar will be effectively guaranteed, especially the clear division of power between the central government of Myanmar and the local autonomous governments of ethnic minorities, which will ensure the development and development of ethnic minority areas in northern Myanmar. The simultaneous development of Bamar areas is the fundamental move to truly eradicate the source of trouble in this area. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, this idea is still a castle in the air before today’s political and social reality in Myanmar. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 20 Nov 2023 17:55:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[“中华老字号”不是护身符：历史招牌只是其表，商业信誉才是其里丨快评]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260947]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-20 16:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Recently, the Ministry of Commerce and other five departments issued the &quot;Notice on Announcement of the Review Results of Chinese Time-honored Brands&quot;, which will lead to long-term poor management. , or even 55 brands that have gone bankrupt, canceled, closed down, or lost the ownership and use rights of time-honored registered trademarks, have been removed from the list of Chinese time-honored brands; 73 brands with poor operations and declining performance are required to be rectified within 6 months; 1,000 brands will continue to be retained A brand with standardized operations and good development. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Chinese time-honored brand&quot; is not only a title/title, but also an officially certified identity/qualification. The &quot;remove, rectify, and retain&quot; measures taken by the five departments to &quot;remove, rectify, and retain&quot; &quot;Chinese time-honored brands&quot; just allow the outside world to rethink the true connotation of &quot;Chinese time-honored brands&quot; and analyze the right and wrong behind &quot;Chinese time-honored brands&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The official definition of the so-called &quot;Chinese time-honored brands&quot; refers to &quot;long history, products, skills or services that have been passed down from generation to generation, with a distinctive traditional Chinese cultural background and profound cultural heritage, and have gained widespread social recognition.&quot; recognition and form a brand with good reputation.” From the literal meaning, &quot;inherited from generation to generation&quot; can be interpreted as &quot;historical and cultural traditional value&quot;, while &quot;products, skills or services are widely recognized by society&quot; can be reduced to &quot;commercial reputation and market status&quot;, which is also the construction of &quot;Chinese time-honored brands&quot;. &quot;Two pillars. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The connotation of &quot;Chinese time-honored brands&quot; is the &quot;traditional cultural background and profound cultural heritage&quot; behind it, or is it the market position and business reputation won in competition? The two cases in this notice can be said to be the answer to this question. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among the &quot;time-honored brands&quot; that have been removed from the list, Inner Mongolia Dashengkui and Anhui Beggar Chicken are two typical cases: Dashengkui lasted for hundreds of years from the Kangxi period of the Qing Dynasty to the Anti-Japanese War. &quot;Yin Yuan Bao Pu&quot; ruled two thousand miles of trade routes in Mongolia. When it resumed business more than ten years ago, it also placed many people&#39;s expectations on reviving the old brand; Anhui beggar&#39;s chicken is said to date back to the Hongwu period of the Ming Dynasty. Although this legend is false and true , but the reason why it was expelled from the &quot;time-honored brand&quot; is not its historical and cultural authenticity, but its poor management in recent years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is not difficult to see that the history of Dashengkui is more authentic, but this does not save it from the bad luck of being &quot;delisted&quot;; Anhui Beggar Chicken has doubts about its history and culture alone, but the last thing that crushed it The straw is probably not an academic verification of authenticity, but a defeat in the competition in the modern catering market. In fact, there is more than one &quot;Beggar&#39;s Chicken&quot;. The &quot;Daoxiang Village&quot; and &quot;Guanshengyuan&quot; that have been removed from the list this time also have brands with the same name. The reason why they failed to pass the review of &quot;Chinese Time-honored Brands&quot; is not because of &quot;historical and cultural traditional value&quot; &quot;Something went wrong. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, for these &quot;Chinese time-honored brands&quot;, if they cannot embrace the latest changes in the market and cannot innovate themselves to meet the needs of consumers, they will inevitably die out; conversely, if a brand can Create brand new products and services, and even if they are not old, they will slowly occupy the minds of consumers and become a new tradition. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Western academic circles have long noticed the phenomenon of &quot;invention of tradition&quot;: those &quot;traditions&quot; that appear or claim to be ancient often originate quite recently, and are sometimes even invented. . This is not uncommon in the Chinese context, which is the common phenomenon of &quot;replying family trees&quot; and &quot;recognizing ancestors&quot;. The &quot;traditional origins&quot; recognized by many &quot;time-honored brands&quot; are often suspected of being attached to others in academic circles. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Facts have proved that whether a tradition really has historical and cultural continuity value and whether it is really academically tenable is not determined by whether the tradition is widely accepted. The key factor is not even important. Regardless of these &quot;time-honored brands&quot;, even emerging companies that have not been established for a long time often have to make some &quot;inventions&quot; and even &quot;legends&quot; in the &quot;brand story&quot;, but no consumer will be like a professional historian. If we continue to delve deeper into how much of this is true and how false, we will be more inclined to spread these wonderful stories. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Such cases abound in China, Europe and the United States. The history of &quot;A diamond is forever, a diamond will last forever&quot; is actually not that long ago, but this advertising slogan and the brand value behind it seem to have existed since ancient times. The untenable &quot;tradition&quot; can still win over consumers. The &quot;Eight Major Cuisines&quot; often claim to have thousands of years of history, but their true origins can often only be traced back to the mid-Qing Dynasty. However, this has not affected the reputation of the major cuisines. After all, food must be felt by the tip of the tongue, and consumers I don&#39;t care much about whether its history is true. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, this does not mean that the authenticity of &quot;time-honored brands&quot; is not important at all. &quot;Century-old stores&quot; that &quot;look fake at first glance&quot; will still make people see through their tricks, and then be suspected of false propaganda. In other words, only the quality of goods and services, consumer choices, and market judgment can enable a company and its brand to gain business credibility, consolidate the company&#39;s brand value, help companies spread their own brand stories, and let &quot;time-honored&quot; brands The brand stands. If a &quot;time-honored brand&quot; becomes a company&#39;s &quot;talisman&quot; and makes the company feel that it can &quot;win&quot; by relying on it, and even relies on the brand&#39;s long-standing mass base to not improve its business management and pay attention to the quality of its products and services, then the result will be in name only. I can&#39;t even keep my name. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Therefore, for a &quot;time-honored enterprise&quot;, the directory and trademark are only the surface, and long-lasting business reputation is the inside. A &quot;Chinese time-honored brand&quot; can maintain its business reputation not by a directory or a trademark, but by the sincere recognition of it as a traditional Chinese brand by consumers. The changes of the times will eliminate some &quot;time-honored brands&quot;, retain some time-honored brands, and also create a number of new &quot;time-honored brands&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 20 Nov 2023 16:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[奶茶按公斤炫！新疆人豪横起来连东北人都害怕]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/260575]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-20 15:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Recently, milk tea in Xinjiang has become a hot topic. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Some netizens posted pictures showing that when buying milk tea in Xinjiang, a cup starts at 1kg, triggering heated discussions among the public about the &quot;bigness&quot; of Xinjiang. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The air in Xinjiang seems to be filled with baking powder, and food will &quot;expand&quot; several times once it arrives in Xinjiang. For example, 10 kinds of Xinjiang delicacies, including Xinjiang’s No. 1 Nang, Big Plate of Chicken, Noodle Soup for Ten Thousands of People, Largest Oil Cake Tower, and Rice Pilaf for Ten Thousand People, have all set Guinness World Records for their “bigness”. Compared with milk tea that starts at 2 pounds, It can be regarded as a &quot;baby meal&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Xinjiang&#39;s largest &quot;Aimai&quot; naan has a diameter of 40 to 50 centimeters. It requires 1 kilogram of flour to make. There are patterns stamped in the middle of the naan, and there are chopped onions or sesame seeds. . Nang with meat in a vat, pitted meat with naan, Xinjiang fried rice noodles with naan... Thousands of ways to eat naan, brewing the nostalgic memory of Xinjiang people when they were children waiting for their mother to break off a piece by the naan pit and feed it to their mouths. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The reason why Xinjiang cuisine is so heavy is that Xinjiang people don’t have the concept of kilograms and liangs. What they call “one kilogram” is actually one kilogram. Because of the &quot;bigness&quot; of Xinjiang, they created their own weights and measures - there are 22 airports in one province of Xinjiang. In their eyes, distances within 1,000 kilometers are very close, and 1,000 kilometers is enough to travel from Beijing to Taiyuan and back. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In addition to the large portions, the prices of Xinjiang dishes are also shocking in Northeast China, which is always known for its affordable prices. According to data from Dianping, the top ten restaurants in Urumqi, the capital of Xinjiang, only cost 74 yuan per person, which is lower than the average price in the capitals of the three eastern provinces. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;It is large in area and heavy in weight, and the &quot;imagination&quot; of Xinjiang people is also very big. Many Xinjiang people&#39;s store names reveal a kind of simple humor. A series of store names such as &quot;Sexy Mommy&#39;s Postpartum Recovery Mother and Baby Center&quot; and &quot;Drag and Drive Over&quot; make people laugh. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;As an inland province, Xinjiang gives people the impression that it has nothing to do with water. Also because of its &quot;large&quot; territory, Xinjiang has almost all the country&#39;s specialties, such as Salmon production accounts for 15% of inland production. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Xinjiang also has great charm. In the first three quarters of this year, Xinjiang received 213.86 million tourists, a year-on-year increase of 77.73%.

It was a cool evening in early September, and the new version of the red children&#39;s drama &quot;The Ballad of Soybean&quot; began its national tour here. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Some Chinese people are familiar with this story. In 1940, the Gansu Provincial Working Committee of the Communist Party of China was destroyed. Luo Lili, who was 8 months old, was arrested at the same time as his parents. After several twists and turns, he was imprisoned in Lanzhou Dashagou Prison, where he spent 6 years. Wang Luobin, who was also in prison, asked Luo Lili what the most delicious food in the world was. Luo Lili, who had never been exposed to the outside world, thought it was broad beans that he had eaten by chance. Wang Luobin composed the song &quot;Soybean Ballad&quot; from this. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;A while after leaving the venue, the crowd suddenly surrounded an old man. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The old man has appeared on CCTV 13 times. On TV, he is smart, wise, and tall. He is proud that he &quot;didn&#39;t make a single mistake&quot; when talking. &quot;, and sometimes, I even have to play and sing &quot;In That Distant Place&quot; on the stage. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;But the old man in front of him has droopy eye bags and a lot of white hair on his sparse head. He kept taking out performance tickets from the small shoulder bag on his chest, a total of 40 tickets, which belonged to &quot;old friends&quot; he had met through cooperation in the name of his father. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Most of these &quot;old friends&quot; reached the peak of their careers in the 1990s. They had their own programs in top media and were able to open solo concerts in the most central concert hall in Beijing. Concert, organize a commemorative concert for Wang Luobin in the most famous building. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;There are also officials from Zhuozhou, Hebei. This county-level city with a population of 650,000 has a 30-square-meter former residence of Wang Luobin and a Wang Luobin Chorus. The director of Zhuozhou Culture and Tourism Bureau and the director of the cultural center drove 60 kilometers to come. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;He is the youngest son of Wang Luobin, the &quot;King of Western Singers&quot;. Wang Luobin&#39;s ancestral home is in Zhuozhou, and a new Wang Luobin Music Memorial Hall is about to be renovated in an old factory in the north of the city as a local cultural landmark. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Wang Luobin, who will appear on the stage in a quarter of an hour, is a &quot;prisoner&quot; who has to go through several political movements before he can be called the King of Singers in the future. , Prison Years, and Social Change. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Wang Luobin&#39;s 83-year ups and downs often give playwrights a headache. He once participated in the Northwest Anti-Japanese War Theater Troupe with Xiao Jun, Seke and others. He was also highly appreciated by the warlord Ma Bufang and formed a children&#39;s theater troupe in Qinghai. During China&#39;s darkest period, he captured a hint of romanticism, and some of the songs he was most proud of in his life were born here, including &quot;In That Distant Place&quot; and &quot;Youth Dance.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;At half past seven, &quot;Soybean Ballad&quot; started. I got a chance to film Wang Haicheng, a documentary director who has been following him for more than ten years. The film is called &quot;Looking for Wang Luobin&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;For the &quot;old friends&quot; in the audience, some people want to promote this drama to a bigger stage, and some people want to make a movie related to Wang Luobin. , two people respectively proposed to build a music school named after the king of singers in Hebei and Hainan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;They all need to obtain authorization from Wang Haicheng. Only a few people realize that everything the son of the King of Songs enjoys at the moment is facing unprecedented challenges. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;On September 11, 2023, in Zhuozhou, Hebei, Wang Haicheng showed his published biography of Wang Luobin and audio and video products.

Among the three sons, the eldest went to Australia in the 1980s. The second child was a truck driver and died of illness. After surviving a period of history, the four fathers and sons now only have the third child left. Therefore, interviews, authorizations, rights protection, concerts, commemorations, and publications all fell on Wang Haicheng. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In fact, for a long time, the identity of &quot;Wang Luobin&#39;s son&quot; made Wang Haicheng breathless. When he was 8 months old, Wang Luobin was arrested, followed by a search of his home. A month later, his mother passed away in the hospital bed. Relatives in Beijing did not dare to have contact with the Wang family. After hearing about it, the fifth uncle in Zhuozhou drove a carriage all day and night from Beijing in the early winter in the north to bring the body back from Beijing and bury it in a wheat field. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;A few years ago, Wang Haicheng tried to find his mother&#39;s tomb, but he could no longer find it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Studying stopped in the second grade of junior high school. When it was time to go to the mountains and countryside, Wang Haicheng stayed on the farm for nine years because of Wang Luobin. When groups of educated young people returned to the city one after another, he also got a nickname: &quot;Cushionzi&quot;. This dialect refers to the last puppy out of a litter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Family is never a place where the singer is willing to devote his attention. Wang Haicheng wrote that the union between his father and his mother was due to the breakup of his father&#39;s previous relationship, so he wanted to take revenge on his life. Wang Luobin was born free. He went to the grassland, to the market, and even in prison, collecting folk songs. A producer who visited the singer&#39;s deeds mentioned a detail. In his later years, Wang Luobin rode a bicycle everywhere. When it got dark, he would lie on the road and fall asleep, and then go home the next day. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Wang Luobin passed away in 1996. Wang Haicheng immediately joined the China Music Copyright Association and registered 207 musical works recorded, organized and created by Wang Luobin with the association. He became increasingly aware that his father had left a shining legacy. Since 2000, Wang Haicheng has successively published two biographies of Wang Luobin, a song sheet of Wang Luobin, invested in TV films, and a long narrative poem. Four exhibition halls have been created in Turpan, Xinjiang, Haibei, Qinghai, Baishui Ancient Town, Dabancheng, Xinjiang, and Liupan Mountain, Ningxia. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;It is difficult to say how father&#39;s love plays a subtle role in Wang Haicheng&#39;s life. In order to guard this heritage, he was like an ascetic, stationed in the Grape Valley of the Flame Mountain for 16 years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In the first few years of the 21st century, the Turpan Wang Luobin Music and Art Museum in Grape Valley was the only temple to commemorate the king of singers. This building has an Ottoman-style white circular dome and 80 panels displaying the singer&#39;s life. Visitors came in the 40℃ high temperature. When they opened the door, they saw the sweaty son of the singer wearing a shirt with Wang Luobin&#39;s logo in front of him. There were biographies, song collections, tapes and records on the counter. When the operation of the art museum was most difficult, Wang Haicheng went to bring in strange stones from the Gobi Desert that looked like pork belly and English letters. This is the most popular commodity in Xinjiang’s tourism market. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;He also set up an incense burner in front of his father&#39;s portrait - Wang Luobin converted to Buddhism in his later years. There was once a man who claimed to be a physicist and kowtowed three times directly to the portrait. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Wang Haicheng honed his speaking skills, pondered the details of his father&#39;s life, paid attention to his image, and never refused any opportunity to appear in the national media. The comment that moved him most came from an old man from Shandong: &quot;Wang Haicheng, you are the biggest filial son in China.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;On July 24, 2022, Wang Luobin Music was located in Putaogou, Turpan, Xinjiang Art Museum.

Ethnic minorities hold weekly house music gatherings. Seven days and nights after the song &quot;Forgetting Love Water&quot; reached Urumqi, the shops in the Grand Bazaar would use rough-sounding speakers to play versions in other languages. The bars all over the street are full of singing bands. On the radio, the male host can talk endlessly about the Beatles, Tchaikovsky and Rachmaninoff. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Yibo, the director of &quot;Looking for Wang Luobin&quot;, was the popular host of the Urumqi Economic Radio program &quot;Music Leisure Island&quot; at the time. After more than 20 years, she believes that Urumqi at that time showed tolerance for all kinds of music and was the &quot;center of Asian music.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;But there is no local singer&#39;s name in popular music. His limelight comes from outside Urumqi. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Wang Luobin was rediscovered in the context of an era where order was brought to order. In May 1981, on an afternoon when the temperature suddenly soared to 33°C and the snow suddenly melted, in a five- to six-square-meter concierge at the Qianjin Theater, Xinhua News Agency reporter Zhao Quanzhang met Wang Luobin, who had just been released from prison. In Zhao Quanzhang&#39;s reminiscence article, this person who looked like Quasimodo in &quot;The Hunchback of Notre Dame&quot; was unemployed, had no household registration, and did not even have &quot;food and oil connections.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Zhao Quanzhang wrote the internal reference for Wang Luobin, and soon received instructions from Song Renqiong, then head of the Organization Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. Zhao Quanzhang once recalled that the work of bringing order to the country was not completely smooth at that time. The resolution of Wang Luobin&#39;s problem had an impact on Xinjiang and the whole country. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Openness was the theme of the 1980s. And for a musician who has experienced the war of resistance, prison, and rehabilitation, is there any symbol more suitable to glimpse a country&#39;s path of exploration? &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In the autumn of 1988, &quot;Eight Thousand Miles to the Clouds and the Moon&quot; hosted by Taiwanese artist Ling Feng went to Xinjiang to interview Wang Luobin. This was the first program from the other side to introduce China. TV programs about mainland China’s customs and customs. Then, Xia Jie, a female writer from Hong Kong, China, also came to visit and wrote three articles. Soon, Singapore, Australia, North America, and overseas Chinese had someone to pay attention to. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The media calls him the King of Western Singers and enjoys special government subsidies. China Record Corporation awarded him the Golden Record Special Creation Award, and UNESCO awarded him the &quot;Promote &quot;Special Contribution Award for Cultural Exchange between East and West&quot;. But all medals are inferior to the gifts given by the people. In the era when the word &quot;fan&quot; only refers to fans, Wang Luobin&#39;s most proud example is, &quot;Chinese friends said that at least half of the two million Chinese in the United States can sing. &quot;In that distant place&quot;&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;A more well-known story is that Sanmao, a female writer from Taiwan, China, moved directly into the home of the singer, and scandals abounded. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Trouble is coming quietly. One day in 1993, Luo Dayou&#39;s agent called. Not long ago, Rolling Stone Records released the tape &quot;Love Song Anniversary - Luo Dayou and Wang Luobin&#39;s Great Collaboration of the Century&quot; without Wang Luobin&#39;s consent. The King of Songs was very angry and took Luo Dayou to court for infringement of his copyright. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Greater controversy ensued. Someone revealed that Ling Feng paid 20,000 yuan to buy out ten of Wang Luobin&#39;s songs, including &quot;In That Faraway Place&quot;, &quot;The Girl from Dabancheng&quot;, &quot;Mayila&quot; and &quot;Youth Dance&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The music issue soon turned into a political issue. Someone asked, can Wang Luobin sell folk songs that belong to the people? &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;A major discussion that lasted for more than a year began. In June 1994, &quot;People&#39;s Music&quot; magazine began to discuss the copyright issue of Wang Luobin&#39;s folk songs. Dai Penghai, an associate researcher at the Shanghai Conservatory of Music, published two articles criticizing the news media for hyping up Wang Luobin, and also accused Wang Luobin of &quot;selling out the people&#39;s sovereignty and interests in national music culture.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;There are also people who support Wang Luobin. Liu Zaisheng, a professor at the Music Department of Shandong Normal University, pointed out that “collecting brotherly ethnic songs in different languages ​​is a more complex and difficult task, and the translation and dubbing of lyrics often plays a key role in success or failure.” And “if we combine the When the lyrics are analyzed together, it is not difficult to find that they have formed Wang Luobin&#39;s unique creative style that is lyrical, colloquial, and popular.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Another background to the great discussion is that during China&#39;s &quot;resumption of customs&quot; negotiations, the Copyright Law was promulgated in 1991, which stipulates that &quot;adaptation, translation, The copyright of works resulting from the annotation and arrangement of existing works shall be enjoyed by the person who adapted, translated, annotated and arranged them.&quot; In other words, if Wang Luobin &quot;adapts, translates, annotates, and organizes&quot; folk songs, the copyright of the new songs belongs to him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;But, does changing one note, two notes, or a chorus count as &quot;adaptation&quot;? &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On August 5 of that year, a symposium attended by more than thirty people was held in Beijing, including musicologists, composers, and legal professionals. people and journalists. The person presiding over the meeting was Qiao Jianzhong, then director of the Music Research Institute of the China Academy of Arts. He later recalled in an article that this symposium was actually an &quot;absent criticism&quot; against Wang Luobin, which was very explosive. However, the meeting finally reached a consensus that Wang Luobin had worked hard in recording, translating, editing, and adapting folk songs, but the rights he enjoyed needed to be quantitatively analyzed before the rights could be determined. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The eighty-year-old singer was very hurt and left the stage to participate in the debate in person several times. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;With the death of Wang Luobin in 1996, the big discussion did not continue. But this discussion could have clarified some fundamental issues, such as the quantitative standards for adaptation and the copyright of folk songs. In that era, Wang Luobin was not the only one who encountered similar problems. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In Shanghai, a young man who was writing &quot;The Complete Works of Xian Xinghai&quot; was also troubled by this problem. In the process of sorting out Xian Xinghai&#39;s works, Wu Yuebei, a top student in the composition department of the Shanghai Conservatory of Music, checked and filled in the original scores. Some melodies that he thought were not harmonious even needed to be changed. When Xian Xinghai&#39;s descendants heard about Wang Luobin&#39;s dispute, they worriedly asked, if the original score was adjusted, would the copyright belong to him? &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;After consulting the leaders of the Ministry of Culture at the time, &quot;The Complete Works of Xian Xinghai&quot; was finally processed as follows: the works with major changes were also included in the revised original works. version, as well as a more substantial adapted version. For revised or revised editions, the name of the reviser will be marked as a footnote at the end of the work, but no copyright will be generated. The edited version will have a copyright page marked with the name of the organizer, who owns the rights to the content compiled by him in the new version, but not the rights to the original work. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;This young man majoring in composition has no way of knowing that after more than 20 years, he may end the discussion about the copyright of the singer. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;Wang Luobin and Luo Dayou.

The family members believe that &quot;Tall White Poplar&quot; is not a folk song, but a song composed by the late musician, originally titled &quot;How Beautiful My Garden is.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The family did not sue Wang Haicheng directly, but first sued an audio-visual company in Guangzhou. The CD published by the company labeled &quot;Tall White Poplar&quot; as a folk song. The court found that the song was composed by the late musician. Afterwards, the family took this judgment and sued Wang Haicheng, claiming 230,000 yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Wang Haicheng said that &quot;Tall White Poplar&quot; was written by his father in 1969 while serving a sentence. At that time, a young man was unjustly imprisoned, and his new wife died. The young man stopped cutting his hair and shaving. Wang Luobin felt inspired and adapted &quot;Tall White Poplar&quot; based on an Ili folk song. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;A friend in Yili told Wang Haicheng that the original version of this ancient folk song can be found in the local archives. But before he was about to leave, the friend said that the information was missing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In August 2004, the court of first instance sentenced Wang Haicheng to pay compensation of 237,000 yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;After the appeal, Wang Haicheng and his lawyer began to think about how to collect evidence. In October 2005, he and his lawyer pretended to be collectors from Beijing and spent 4,600 yuan to buy a small video camera. After arriving in Yili, they arranged to grab mutton and invited local music teachers and old people who could sing folk songs for interviews. At first, they did not reveal their interest in &quot;Tall White Poplar&quot; and started talking about Ili folk songs. The cameras are always working. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;After the conversation was almost over, Wang Haicheng turned to &quot;Tall White Poplar&quot; and asked if there was an original folk song version of this song. Everyone said yes, and everyone hummed a line. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;But when they reveal their identities, very few people are willing to testify. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;After hitting a wall one after another, they finally found three old people willing to testify. I also met an &quot;Avanti&quot; (meaning &quot;teacher&quot;) named Ishamuddin, who said that the original song had probably been circulated for two hundred years, and he also knew that a lawsuit was ongoing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;At that time, Wang Haicheng thought that if he lost the lawsuit, &quot;things would develop like dominoes.&quot; Dozens of publishers had published this song Society will also be in crisis. Even if he travels to Hainan, he will pray with Mazu, hoping that Mazu can help him, the son of the king of singers, who is in trouble. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On May 8, 2006, the Xinjiang High Court made a judgment that the two songs each enjoyed property rights in copyright. In Wang Haicheng&#39;s words, &quot;Both songs come from folk songs, and they are in a parallel relationship.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;At almost the same time, Wang Haicheng launched a blanket rights protection campaign that lasted for several years. For the sake of copyright, he fought against pirated CDs, KTV bosses, and singers who randomly covered his father&#39;s works. His opponents include audio-visual city vendors, publishers, university professors, as well as Li Yuchun, Tan Weiwei and Wang Sulong. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;It was in 2004 when he was ordered to pay 237,000 yuan in compensation that Wang Haicheng received an unfamiliar phone call. The other party introduced himself like this: Ju Yonghe, a native of Jiangsu, a lawyer in Beijing, and a loyal fan of Wang Luobin. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;When they finally met a year later, Wang Haicheng was deeply impressed by his &quot;uprightness and non-joking&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;He said that he was concerned that there were many publications infringing Wang Luobin&#39;s rights on the market, and he especially wanted to help protect his rights.&quot; Wang Haicheng was &quot;a little nervous financially at the time, and he was also weighing Should I file a lawsuit?&quot; Lawyer Ju dispelled his concerns: He would bear the cost of the lawsuit. If he lost the lawsuit, he would not ask Wang Haicheng for money. If he won, he would pay half of it after deducting travel expenses. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;This may be a more subtle way, and it also uses legal weapons to confirm again and again that Wang Luobin owns the copyright to a certain song. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Since 2005, Lawyer Ju has continued to make efforts. He went to the audio and video market and Xinhua Bookstore, walked around, saw the allegedly infringing publications, bought them, issued invoices, and sued. &quot;All those audio and video publishers came to me to ask for authorization. They can also use high-definition pictures of Wang Luobin on the covers of their publications. I also provided the introduction of Wang Luobin on the inside pages. It is more accurate and the text is smoother.&quot;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Wang Luobin became an inviolable icon. Around 2010, Lawyer Ju moved to KTV. In the words of the time, it was a &quot;mopping up&quot; operation. KTV&#39;s infringement made Wang Haicheng even more intolerable. The scenes in &quot;In That Distant Place&quot; were of Hainan beaches and bikini beauties. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Based on the Yangtze River Delta, Lawyer Ju gradually expanded the scope of his operations. In his eyes, &quot;the judicial environment in the Yangtze River Delta was relatively good at the time.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Victory is like a snowball getting bigger and bigger. In the eyes of some people in the music industry, even if it didn&#39;t belong to him before, it belongs to him now. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;According to Wang Haicheng, the economic benefits in this round were not as much as people imagined. The compensation involved in the case that he received was &quot;about 120,000 yuan.&quot; &quot;. But he is very happy and feels that this battle is going smoothly and &quot;the pirated KTVs have been beaten into silence.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In this battle, he gave himself an indestructible meaning: to maintain his father&#39;s eternal status in the history of Chinese music. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;But this blanket rights protection came to an abrupt end in 2013, and Wang Haicheng was put in a tight ring. After mediation by the Supreme People&#39;s Court, Wang Luobin&#39;s descendants reached an agreement: some of the previous lawsuits should be withdrawn. &quot;If the lawsuit cannot be withdrawn, the accepting authority should proactively notify the accepting agency to add Wang Haiyan (eldest brother) and Wang Haixing (second brother) as co-litigants. Everything involving Mr. Wang Luobin&#39;s intellectual property rights All litigation actions should be jointly made by three persons (Wang Haiyan, Wang Haixing and Wang Haicheng) to make substantive decisions.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;It will be 6 years before Lawyer Ju appears again. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;On September 10, 2023, Wang Haicheng came to an old factory in Zhuozhou, Hebei, where the Wang Luobin Music Memorial Hall is being planned.

Bancheng Girl was born in 1938, while Alam Khan did not appear until May 1944. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;One ​​reason is that Wang Luobin rarely signs his name. He compiled a book called &quot;Song of the Northwest&quot; related to the Anti-Japanese War. The back cover said &quot;Compiled and printed by the Gansu People&#39;s Anti-Enemy Support Association.&quot; Wang Luobin said in his autobiography, &quot;I think this work is a citizen&#39;s duty.&quot; In this special era, many of his songs were not signed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Wang Hai wrote three biographies of his father, a large part of which is about tracing his father&#39;s creative story. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;But it was 1974 when he first heard his father talk about his creative motivations. One day, the father and son went to a friend&#39;s house to celebrate their child&#39;s full moon. With the wine mixed with alcohol, everyone booed and asked Wang Haicheng to sing. He took over the guitar, finished singing &quot;Manli&quot;, and vividly talked about the origin of the song. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;There was a pair of lovers on the Mongolian grasslands. During the Anti-Japanese War, the man signed up to join the army to fight. The woman heard from the rear that the man had died. She was very sad and died of illness. &quot;The man came back from the war and heard that his fiancée was dead, so he ran to the cemetery and sang this song in front of her grave. Suddenly, this woman stood up from behind the grave again.&quot; Wang Haicheng recalled. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Wang Luobin, who was no longer very talkative, took a sip of wine and said: &quot;Today is so interesting. My son sang a song by Lao Tzu. I didn&#39;t know that the song was from Lao Tzu.&quot; &quot;Written.&quot; It was a pornographic song, and criticism of it reached its peak in the 1950s. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;More stories were collected during the period when I temporarily lived with my father at my second brother’s house. Father and son sleep in a small room together, with two beds on the left and right and a window in the middle. During the day, Wang Luobin opened the bed and used the bed board as a table to copy music scores. &quot;He did not forget to revise the songs while copying them, and he sang them while writing.&quot; At night, the mosquitoes kept the two awake. On nights like this in the 1970s, Wang Haicheng asked his silent father again and again: I heard that there is a song that is also yours? &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;But this experience will not be helpful until 30 years later, when Wang Haicheng writes his father&#39;s biography. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;After his father passed away, it became more difficult to find songs. The problem of songs was sometimes a legal issue, and sometimes even a political issue. There is only one song whose origin does not need to be searched by Wang Haicheng, and that is &quot;In That Distant Place&quot;, the &quot;Crown Pearl&quot; of the King of Western Songs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In 1939, Wang Luobin followed director Zheng Junli to Qinghai to shoot the movie &quot;Long Live the Nation&quot;. Dolma, the daughter of a Tibetan head of thousands of households, was chosen to be the shepherdess. Wang Luobin Become a helper. While driving the sheep, Wang Luobin accidentally whipped his horse&#39;s buttocks. Dolma on the horse swung the whip and hit Wang Luobin gently. Thus, there is the plot in the lyrics: &quot;I would like to be a little lamb/follow her side/I would like her to hold a whip/keep hitting me gently every day.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The singer himself has told this story to the media too many times. But maybe it’s just that there are so many stories that one day in the future, people with a heart will begin to compare the time, place and characters of each story, and discover flaws that are difficult to correct. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Wang Luobin also told actor Ma Yue. The actor won the second prize in bel canto singing in the amateur group of the Youth Singing Competition in his early years. Once during a solo concert at the Beijing Opera House, after singing &quot;In That Faraway Place&quot;, an old man with a goatee came to him and said, &quot;Ma Yue, you look a lot like me when I was young.&quot; Second. The sentence is, &quot;You sang my song inaccurately.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;That was 1994 when the big discussion was launched. The singer pointed out two of his mistakes, one of which was that the tune was wrong, &quot;I was in prison, and you were singing my songs outside. Now I sing the song back to its original form, and everyone says I sang it wrong. I You can&#39;t change it back.&quot; - Many people don&#39;t know that the widely sung &quot;In That Faraway Place&quot; is indeed not the version written by Wang Luobin. His version and the score are now engraved on his tombstone. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Afterwards, the two met twice, and the singer added about the spread of the song. He said, &quot;Among the frontline anti-Japanese officers and soldiers, there are many people who sing. Why? Because there is a good girl in the heart of every anti-Japanese soldier.&quot; This young man, whose career was on the rise, realized that &quot;all of Wang Luobin&#39;s works grew out of the soil of the nation.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;Wang Haicheng and his father Wang Luobin (right).

I am very confused, what on earth did this family commit? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The day after the performance of &quot;Soybean Ballad&quot;, one of Wang Luobin&#39;s students entertained Wang Haicheng for a banquet. When the food was over, she asked seriously if she needed help. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Old friends are worried for a reason. The second round of rights protection launched by Wang Haicheng in 2019 has just suffered a defeat. In June 2023, the Beijing Intellectual Property Court&#39;s final judgment determined that Wang Luobin and his descendants no longer enjoyed the copyright of &quot;Kangding Love Song&quot;, &quot;Four Seasons Tune&quot; and &quot;Under the Silver Moonlight&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;9 months ago, the Intermediate Court of Yangzhou City, Jiangsu Province identified Wang Luobin as the copyright holder of &quot;Kangding Love Song&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Different from the rights protection that came to an abrupt end ten years ago, the defendants this time are mostly professionals in the music industry and publishing houses. Among the list are Gong Yaonian, a national first-class composer, Hu Tingjiang, deputy director of the Composition Department of the China Conservatory of Music, and the People&#39;s Music Publishing House. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The dispute mainly focuses on whether the music presented in these composers&#39; publications is plagiarized or adapted from Wang Luobin&#39;s version. &lt;p>; Arrangement&quot;. This aroused Wang Haicheng&#39;s dissatisfaction. In his opinion, 9 films including &quot;In That Distant Place&quot; belong to Wang Luobin. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Using an inappropriate metaphor proposed by the other party, it is the relationship between grandfather and grandson. We believe that grandfather must be a folk work, which is relatively stable. &quot;Li Ye, deputy director of the editorial office of People&#39;s Music Publishing House, said, &quot;But to use the other party&#39;s words in court, &#39;Wang Luobin is the grandfather, and the rest of you are all grandchildren.&#39;&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text -align: left;&quot;>;The defendants also raised questions based on this, believing that some of Wang Luobin&#39;s songs were not &quot;adapted&quot; at all, and were even directly &quot;copied&quot; from other people&#39;s creations. The family members of one of the defendants also discovered that the authenticity of those stories written by Wang Haicheng and the song king&#39;s creation is open to question. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;This defendant&#39;s family member is Wu Yuebei, the young man who participated in the compilation of &quot;The Complete Works of Xian Xinghai&quot; more than 20 years ago. He is now a professor at the Central Conservatory of Music and a doctoral supervisor in composition. The defendant Gong Yaonian is his father-in-law. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The second round of rights protection came in force. At the beginning, the defendants fought on their own. Hu Tingjiang, who was the first to be prosecuted, adapted a piece of &quot;Mayila Variations&quot;. For this song alone, lawyer Ju sued him nearly a hundred times in many courts across the country. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;When Hu Tingjiang recalled the process of being prosecuted, he still had a lot of confusion. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Around 2017, Wang Haicheng suddenly added Hu Tingjiang on WeChat, telling him that the &quot;Maira Variations&quot; he adapted came from Wang Luobin&#39;s &quot;Maira&quot; and that he needed to get his own Authorization. Hu Tingjiang replied that he respected Mr. Wang Luobin, but &quot;Mayila&quot; was not composed by Wang Luobin, but a well-known Kazakh folk song. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Once, Wang Haicheng sent another message, praising Hu Tingjiang&#39;s adaptation as very successful and hoping that he would continue to work hard and adapt more of Wang Luobin&#39;s works. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In June 2017, Wang Haicheng sent another solo concert program from Changji College, with the words &quot;Youth Dance adapted by Hu Tingjiang&quot; printed on it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Not long after, he was prosecuted. Subpoenas were sent from all over the country. Hu Tingjiang remembered that the courier in the community delivered express delivery to the court every day, and he was very puzzled, &quot;What on earth did this family commit?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; It wasn&#39;t until a live broadcast of the court hearing that Hu Tingjiang, who was fighting alone, learned that Gong Yaonian had also been prosecuted. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Soon, these professors, musicians, and publishers who were sued formed an alliance to exchange information. There are 43 people in the &quot;Wang Luobin Copyright Case Defendant Lawyers Group&quot;, and there are more than ten publishing houses in the &quot;Music Publications Consortium&quot;. Unlike those KTV and audio-visual companies that were sued by the son of the singer, the people in the &quot;Alliance&quot; adhere to the belief that even if they are only compensated for 10,000 yuan, they must explain the truth clearly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On the afternoon of April 20, 2023, 29 years after the launch of the big discussion, another symposium was held at the People&#39;s Music Publishing House, called &quot;Ethnic Folk Music Protection of Works - Thoughts on the case of Wang Luobin’s descendants suing over the copyright dispute of western folk songs.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Before this day, Li Ye once doubted whether some publishing houses as far away as Shanghai and Hunan would send representatives to attend this half-day meeting. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On that day, she was surprised to find that more than 30 publishing houses, many of which were attended by their leaders in person. At the meeting, some people admitted that they were hesitant when faced with court summons: (Wang Haicheng) asked for 10,000 yuan per song, and if they bargained with him for 5,000 yuan, they could settle down. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Later, someone suggested that it was not about money. In the end, everyone reached a consensus, okay, let&#39;s fight to the end.&quot; Li Ye said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Another consensus reached at the meeting was that &quot;corresponding laws and regulations should be promulgated as soon as possible at the legislative level&quot; so as to &quot;have laws to follow and avoid the same cases in judicial practice&quot; The situation of different judgments”. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In fact, the Copyright Law promulgated in 1991 originally stipulated that &quot;the measures for copyright protection of folk literary and artistic works shall be separately formulated by the State Council.&quot; But so far there is no follow-up. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The most active ones, Hu Tingjiang, Wu Yuebei and others, searched through the libraries of the Central Conservatory of Music, the China Conservatory of Music and the China Music Research Institute, and even Original materials were also sought from the Kazakhstan State Publishing House and the Moscow Library in Russia. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;After more than three years of searching and research, Wu Yuebei now believes that he can complete the task that his teachers failed to complete many years ago and bring Wang Luobin down from the altar. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;At the end of September 2023, I met Wu Yuebei in a community near Wanshou Park in Beijing. He has a majestic face with Chinese characters and a tired grace when he walks. Next to a piano, he prepared a chair and a laptop for me, which contained the evidence he collected. Before the trial, he had to bring two things, a Bluetooth speaker and a suitcase full of evidence. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The composer asked me to stare at the computer screen carefully.

Previously, the authorities planned to cancel subsidies for students to use coal for meals, which was opposed by students. After the &quot;coal incident&quot;, students in this school located in a subtropical valley began to seek autonomy. At the same time, after seeing how the Yangko movement in Yan&#39;an shaped revolutionary art, they could not wait to find something more profound from the soil of folk songs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;At that time, the situation was uncertain, but this group of music students began to worry about more eternal issues. In the first volume of their mimeographed &quot;Chinese Folk Songs&quot;, there is such an ambition: &quot;After analyzing these folk songs, problems that have not been paid special attention to in Western composition studies will emerge, and attempts to solve these problems will lead to the path of national music. .&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;There was no way to collect music at that time. According to the recall article by Xie Gongcheng, one of the members, the songs in the first series of &quot;Chinese Folk Songs&quot; were from &quot;New Music&quot; Magazines, Yan&#39;an chants, Wang Luobin&#39;s &quot;Northwestern Folk Song Collection&quot; and personal relationships, I have collected more than a hundred folk songs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;This &quot;Collection of Northwest Folk Songs&quot; was published in Chongqing in 1942. At the end of 1939, Wang Luobin handed the manuscript to Zhang Xiluo, a journalist from Chongqing, in Xining, asking him to publish it. However, Zhang Xiluo did not find the opportunity until he opened Dagong Bookstore. The collection of books in the Capital Library shows that the song album contains 17 songs, but there is no &quot;In That Faraway Place&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;During the collection process of &quot;Chinese Folk Songs&quot;, students from the piano group were responsible for accompaniment, and the vocal group was responsible for practicing singing. Two more teachers joined the faculty, namely Chen Tianhe, professor and academic director of the Department of Composition, and Jiang Dingxian, professor and director of the Department of Composition. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;History bifurcated here. Although the public regards Wang Luobin as a benchmark for western folk songs, and academics have also paid attention to Wang Luobin, in the music education of professional colleges, the history of folk songs as a system began with the &quot;Folk Song Movement&quot; of the Folk Song Society. When it comes to &quot;Alam Khan&quot;, they will think of the mixed four-part chorus adapted by Xie Gongcheng in 1945; when it comes to &quot;Kangding Love Song&quot;, they will think of Jiang Dingxian; and when it comes to the king of songs, &quot;The Crown Pearl&quot; &quot;In That Far Place&quot;, The person they thought of was Chen Tianhe. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;There is only one reason. The accompaniment of the popular version of this song was performed by Chen Tianhe. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Wu Yuebei looked for clues from Wang Luobin&#39;s own words. &quot;People&#39;s Music&quot; magazine published an article &quot;History is Just&quot; written by Wang Luobin in 1994, which mentioned that his former colleague, a woman named Chou Huiying, could be used to testify about &quot;In That Distant Place&quot; , &quot;Not only can it prove that I wrote this song, but it can also prove that this song should be copyrighted.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;At that time, Chou Huiying was already the chairman of the Taipei Music Copyright Owners Association. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Wu Yuebei found the &quot;Collection of Northwest Folk Songs&quot; compiled and compiled by Chou Huiying in 1967. There are 88 songs in total, 84 of which are marked as arranged by Chou Huiying, while &quot;In That Distant Place&quot; is marked as arranged by Chen Tianhe. Interestingly, the version written by Chen Tianhe is the currently popular minor version, while the one engraved on Wang Luobin&#39;s tombstone is the major version. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In 1994, Chou Huiying presented to the Central Conservatory of Music a copy of &quot;Selected Chinese Folk Songs&quot; that she participated in the translation of in 1982. Wu Yuebei discovered that the entire book None of them bear her name. As for &quot;In That Distant Place&quot;, only &quot;Qinghai Folk Songs&quot; were written. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;These two versions seem to contradict each other, but in Wu Yuebei&#39;s view, they illustrate two key issues. First of all, there is no version of Wang Luobin in the books published by Chou Huiying. Secondly, according to Wu Yuebei&#39;s analysis, the reason why the second version does not even have the names of Chou Huiying and Chen Tianhe is that this version &quot;removed the &#39;organizing&#39; part.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;This is actually an old topic that was discussed in the 1990s. What exactly is &quot;adaptation, arrangement&quot;, and what is the difference between &quot;notation&quot;? &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In Wu Yuebei&#39;s view, organization is based on the original work, through additions, deletions and deletions, to simplify complex works, for example, to simplify a classical Chinese work The work, coupled with my own expression, becomes a readable vernacular work. The adaptation must be incremental, for example, a folk song is changed into a symphony. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Moreover, folk songs have their own particularities. Folk songs are songs created by the public. The words and music have been continuously polished and transformed by countless people. Different versions will be produced according to different times and places. Wu Yuebei gave another example, &quot;If you change &#39;Moonlight in front of the bed&#39; to &#39;Moonlight in front of the window,&#39; will you replace Li Bai?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; He found a &quot;Selected Chinese Folk Songs&quot; published by the Folk Song Society in 1946, which included a minor version of &quot;In That Distant Place&quot; and stated that it was &quot;accompanied by Chen Tianhe.&quot; According to Wu Yuebei&#39;s investigation, this was sung by a female student from Qinghai to Chen Tianhe in 1945, and the latter composed the piano music for it. Wang Luobin&#39;s version was officially published in &quot;Selected Luobin Songs&quot; in 1983. Wang Luobin knew that the minor-key version existed and was included in the book, but he explained that it was the result of female students who went to school in Chongqing singing &quot;out of tune.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;According to some rumors, this female student is Chou Huiying who graduated from Chongqing National Conservatory of Music in 1947. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;A memoir titled &quot;Walking Through the Traces of Memory&quot; also accidentally mentioned Chou Huiying and Wang Luobin. This book was dictated by Luo Wenzhi, the former vice president of the Ningxia Huangpu Military Academy Alumni Association, in 2010, and written by his son Luo Jiyuan. It mentioned that in August 1993, Luo Wenzhi met his cousin Chou Huiying in Beijing. During the chat, Chou Huiying mentioned that in 1993, Wang Luobin reunited with her in Taipei and learned that she had been spreading her Western works such as &quot;In That Distant Place&quot;, &quot;Youth Dance&quot; and &quot;The Girl from Dabancheng&quot; adapted and created in Qinghai for many years. Folk songs, full of emotion. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;When and where was the &quot;Crown Pearl&quot; born? According to research by Liang Maochun, a professor at the Central Conservatory of Music, a musical called &quot;Desert Flower&quot; was staged in Xining in 1940. The event was reported in the magazine &quot;New Music&quot; published in November 1942. The &quot;Collin&quot; magazine published in December of the following year recorded the complete script and music of the play. In the preface of &quot;Desert Song&quot;, Wang Luobin mentioned that the episodes used in the play are all Kazakh folk songs with new lyrics. &quot;I Want to Be a Shepherd&quot;, the predecessor of &quot;In That Far Far Away&quot;, appears in the first act. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;History meets on a narrow road here, but as the parties involved pass away one by one, some claims have become difficult to verify. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In 2023, Lawyer Ju’s view is that the signature on any one or several “earliest publications” cannot prove that the signer is the 80s The author of a certain song years ago. He also made an analogy: &quot;A person wears a watch on his wrist. Life experience tells us that the person wearing the watch is the owner of the watch. The person wearing the watch does not need to provide any other evidence such as a purchase invoice to prove it. Wang Luobin during his lifetime and their descendants claimed, exercised and defended their rights to songs such as &quot;Kangding Love Song&quot;, &quot;Four Seasons&quot; and &quot;Mayila&quot;. In the past forty years, no one else has claimed rights. There is no more powerful life experience than this Proof to the contrary.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;How did Wu Yuebei, a music student at that time, become the main force in the music industry more than 20 years later? &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;One ​​reason is that he has known Wang Luobin since the 1980s. Many of his friends and teachers, including Dai Penghai and Xie Gongcheng, participated in the great discussion in the 1990s. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;A more important reason may be that Wu Yuebei is in charge of a national folk song inheritance project, and Wang Haicheng&#39;s prosecution will make his work abnormal. difficult. Should folk songs related to Wang Luobin be included? Will there be any legal risks after inclusion? What if a few more similar people pop up? &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Not long ago, an editor asked Li Ye if he still wanted to use western folk songs. What should he do? &quot;I suggested to him that the case has not been finalized yet, so don&#39;t use it yet.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;The 1947 edition of &quot;Selected Chinese Folk Songs&quot; found by Hu Tingjiang, in which &quot;Kangding Love Song&quot; was signed &quot;Jiang Dingxian&quot;.

They both found that society is paying more attention to the new series of lawsuits. Not high. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;To this day, there are still memorial halls of Wang Luobin in Zhuozhou, Haibei Prefecture, Baishui Ancient Town, and the Grand Bazaar in Urumqi, and even the principal of an art school, Baoding City A member of the CPPCC also hopes that all children in Zhuozhou can sing Wang Luobin&#39;s songs. In early September 2023, at a lecture at China Three Gorges University, Wu Yuebei mentioned this protracted copyright dispute, but except for the teachers, the students in the audience did not know who Wang Luobin was. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Today, the person who knows the Western singer best lives in a 26-story commercial building in the north of Zhuozhou. This is the residence Wang Haicheng purchased after being moved by the enthusiasm of Zhuozhou officials. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Most of the time, Wang Haicheng is a sophisticated old man who strictly restrains himself. Once, he took me to the old factory in Zhuozhou to check the construction progress of Wang Luobin Music and Art Museum. He then received a call from the other party who wanted to buy Wang Luobin&#39;s manuscripts. He agreed &quot;very well&quot;, hung up the phone, and winked at me, &quot;It would be terrible if others knew that Wang Luobin&#39;s son was selling manuscripts.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;He is easily excited, especially when talking about these tough, academic opponents. He will doubt their opponents&#39; motives and admire their cunning. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;It is difficult to confirm whether Wang Haicheng understands these accusations from the professional music circle. In this commercial house, he kept bringing out Wang Luobin&#39;s self-published works and several thick anthologies of Xinjiang folk songs, and repeatedly emphasized that the change of a note or a word was the result of his father&#39;s painstaking consideration. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Uyghur is polysyllabic and Chinese is monosyllabic. When we Han people say good, it means &#39;good&#39;, and when Uyghurs say good, it means &#39;yahexi&#39;. If you want Xinjiang folk songs to be sung smoothly in Chinese, you must undergo major surgery.&quot; Wang Haicheng can also give more examples. For example, &quot;Alam Khan&quot; was adapted for a children&#39;s troupe in Qinghai, so half a rest was added for convenience. Children breathe while singing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The 72-year-old still needs to answer the question of the &quot;love&quot; between his father and Sanmao. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;I&#39;ve seen it before. When we had dinner at my house, my wife made two meals of noodles for Sanmao. Before leaving, she told me about &quot;Hai.&quot; OK, I have been here for several days, and today is the most comfortable day for me.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;I understand her, there is a way to go home She wanted to integrate into the family, and she wanted to live with my father.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;One ​​of the reasons why he kept repeating his father&#39;s stories was that It used to work. His &quot;My Father Wang Luobin&quot; Douban score is 7.9, and many people have shed tears for it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In the Zhuozhou Library, Sanmao’s photo is placed on a desk that was moved from Xinjiang and used by Wang Luobin. The photo is decorated with a yellow and white Wrapped in wool, Wang Haicheng said that everything was arranged according to the scene during Wang Luobin&#39;s lifetime. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;But in the several photos of Wang Luobin and the desk he showed later, there was no photo of Sanmao on the table. He also explained that the photo was actually placed on the cabinet. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Today, some stories don’t work. The Tianjin High Court determined that Hu Tingjiang&#39;s adaptation of &quot;Mayila&quot; did not infringe; when hearing the case of Hu Tingjiang&#39;s version of &quot;Youth Dance&quot;, the Hubei High Court directly stated in a 34-page judgment: If it supports Wang Haicheng and others&#39; rights protection claims, then It is tantamount to &quot;attributing the rights to original folk songs to individuals.&quot; The Hubei High Court also pointed out a series of &quot;risks&quot; after litigation: once rights protection is supported, Wang Haicheng and others can arbitrarily initiate litigation against other later works of the same origin or re-interpreted works based on Wang Luobin&#39;s prior works. This is undoubtedly &quot;detrimental to the original folk song rights.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Another reason is that Wang Haicheng spent half his life continuing to build the world his father left behind. Those who accuse Wang Luobin of not having copyright may make all this disappear. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;He is the child among the three brothers who has the true inheritance of Wang Luobin. So far, he plays the piano and strums the guitar every day. If someone says that he and Wang Luobin are very close, Like, then he will show a genuine smile. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Wang Luobin did have a dream to let his songs be sung for 500 years. So far, the longest-sung Chinese song is said to be &quot;Jasmine&quot; which has been circulated for nearly 400 years. In 1794, the Macartney mission, which finally met Emperor Qianlong, was preparing to return to England from Guangzhou. Here, the mission secretary John Barrow heard the Cantonese version of &quot;Jasmine&quot;. He wrote in &quot;Travel in China&quot; He recorded the song in Roman pinyin and translated the lyrics, making it the earliest record in Europe. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;So, who is pushing the eternal universe of the King of the West and letting it slide into the abyss of oblivion? &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Maybe this has nothing to do with the law. All cultural icons will disappear in time. First, they fall, and then their fans grow old. Idols may be briefly mentioned again at a certain moment or period - but this is only by chance. In the end, they will sink into the long fog again. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;How many people remember that this year is actually the 80th anniversary of Sanmao’s birth? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;On September 10, 2023, in Zhuozhou Library, Hebei Province, Sanmao&#39;s photo was placed on the table on the right, and Wang Haicheng was playing &quot;Youth Dance&quot;.

He had just been discharged from the hospital with a ruddy complexion and silver hair, and he often laughed vigorously when he spoke. In the afternoon of the same day, a tenor came to visit and overheard the conversation about Wang Luobin. He said, &quot;We don&#39;t dare to touch Wang Luobin&#39;s songs. Our (unit) has also been sued.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left ;&quot;>;In the summer of 1982, Du Yaxiong was still a young man and lived in Wang Luobin&#39;s house to help him organize his music scores. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Recalling the summer forty years ago, Du Yaxiong had a vague feeling that Wang Luobin didn&#39;t actually understand the origin of his song, &quot;After all, he didn&#39;t mess with us. In this major (ethnomusicology), we are very clear about whether a song is a folk song or a creative song.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Ethnomusicology began in 1959. Kunst, a Dutch musicologist who was stationed in Java for 15 years, renamed the third edition of his book &quot;Musicology&quot; to &quot;Ethnomusicology&quot;, thereby creating this discipline. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Wang Luobin told Du Yaxiong that the song &quot;Dudar and Maria&quot; was sung by an old Kazakh lady in Xining, Qinghai around 1940. Including &quot;Mayila&quot;, Wang Luobin believed that these were folk songs, but Du Yaxiong disagreed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Those who have studied Kazakh folk songs can tell that these are not folk songs. Why? Kazakh folk songs have a specific rhythm, and a song is divided into a verse and a chorus. There are two parts. The lyrics of the main song must be 11 syllables, and their combinations can be 344, 443, or 434. Each combination is a musical step.&quot; Du Yaxiong said, &quot;There is another rule, that is, the combination of lyrics and music does not match. Generally, The lyrics and music are consistent. However, one phrase of the Kazakh folk song has ended, but the words have not yet been sung. The last step of the first phrase must be put into the second phrase to sing; or the first phrase must be used. Sing the first note of the second line of the lyrics in the last section.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Du Yaxiong speculated that this way of presenting music is likely to come from the daily life of the Kazakh people. Life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Nomads have an exchange mechanism. Young people will not stay in tents all the time and go to herd sheep. If you are going to a Kazakh tent as a guest , riding a horse, 200 meters away from the tent, shout out &quot;Ahh--&quot; first. If there is someone in the tent, he will come out, tie the dog up, and respond to you with &quot;Ah-h--&quot;.&quot; A scholar who studies the history of music evolution playfully added, &quot;But my analysis may not be correct.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;If not folk songs, what are they? &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Du Yaxiong understands Kazakh. After many inquiries, he finally found the author of &quot;Dudar and Maria&quot; and &quot;Mayila&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The author of the first song is Maria Jagger (1887-1950), who was born in Akmola, Kazakhstan. People&#39;s Artist of Stan. Du Yaxiong concluded that she composed this song around 1903. This song is widely circulated in Kazakhstan and has been the theme of many musical works. Judging from the time recorded by Wang Luobin, this song was introduced to China in the early 1930s at the latest. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The author of the second song is Mayila Shamsuttinova (1890-1927), a professor at the Almaty Conservatory of Music. Mati Zhubanov once introduced this person in the book &quot;The Nightingale of the Times&quot; and said that this song is the author&#39;s &quot;self-portrait&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Du Yaxiong also researched &quot;The Girl from Dabancheng&quot;. He went to Turpan to find the original version of this song and found that the local version was weak and Syncopated rhythm. He was curious about why Wang Luobin&#39;s version was not like this. Wang Luobin&#39;s statement was that the driver he heard sang it was like this - not that Wang Haicheng said that he actively changed it to a version suitable for Han people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;About &quot;Youth Dance&quot;, Wang Luobin told Du Yaxiong: &quot;It was recorded in Dongguan, Jiuquan in 1939. The lyrics are the original ones, not compiled by me. ”&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;As for &quot;Crown Pearl&quot;, Du Yaxiong does not think that the popular version is the result of being &quot;out of tune&quot;, but a version with a male accent, using &quot; &quot;Reverse tune&quot; technique to create a female accent. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Therefore, in the 1983 &quot;Selected Songs of Luobin&quot;, Du Yaxiong divided the songs into two parts, the first part was folk songs, and the second part was Wang Luobin&#39;s Creation, and these songs are all in the first part. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;However, Du Yaxiong also affirmed Wang Luobin&#39;s contribution in translating minority languages, &quot;Even if I can write songs in minority languages, it is difficult to translate the lyrics It is too difficult to translate it into Chinese, and the translation must be faithful, elegant and expressive. Of course, some things are no longer correct from the original, so he is half-edited and half-translated.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In fact, in the final judgment of the Beijing Intellectual Property Court, Wang Haicheng still achieved partial victory. The court found that Wang Luobin and his descendants continued to enjoy the copyright of lyrics and music for &quot;Dabancheng Girl&quot;, &quot;Dudar and Maria&quot;, &quot;Maira&quot; and &quot;In That Faraway Place&quot;; for &quot;Youth Dance&quot;, they also enjoyed the copyright of lyrics. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;But Wang Haicheng still believes that someone is accelerating this disappearance. Not long ago, when Beijing Normal University was producing the musical &quot;The Ballad of the Past,&quot; someone suggested that &quot;In That Faraway Place&quot; might be controversial. The school conveyed that it was reported by a lawyer. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The lawyer&#39;s name is Dong Xiaoyue, and she is Chen Tianhe&#39;s granddaughter. She also has a persistent life. When I was holding a chorus competition in high school, a classmate mentioned that &quot;In That Far Far Place&quot; belonged to Wang Luobin and she would scratch her. Chen Tianhe passed away in 1955. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Dong Xiaoyue, who was born in the 1980s, worked as a reporter and book editor, but this matter has troubled her from time to time. Around 2010, she began to look for &quot;Selected Chinese Folk Songs&quot; by the Folk Song Society in major libraries in Beijing. The earliest version of this book only had two volumes in China. She finally found it in the internal library of the Music Research Institute of the China Academy of Arts. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Just like the result of a life experience, Dong Xiaoyue became a lawyer. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Someone once asked her to collect copyright fees. She replied in a letter: &quot;We should no longer be entangled in copyright disputes and let everything go. Music issues do not need to be left to the law.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Wang Luobin, a young man more than eighty years ago, would not have thought that the copyright and origin of a song could be so far away that It&#39;s going to be so important in the future. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In 1935, at the age of 22, he worked as a music teacher in a middle school outside Xizhimen, Beijing. There was a river nearby, and he would go swimming in the river at noon in the summer. There were also many college students who migrated after the fall of Northeast China. One day, people with bare buttocks and covered in mud were listening to their classmates read &quot;August Village&quot;. This novel describes the story of the Northeast soldiers and civilians fighting against the Japanese invaders after the &quot;September 18th&quot; Incident. When he read a poem called &quot;I want love, I also want the freedom of my motherland&quot;, the passionate Wang Luobin put on his clothes, copied the poem, and went home to compose music. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Later, a young man came and said that he wrote and sang well, but did he know who the author of the novel was. Wang Luobin was embarrassed and didn&#39;t know the answer.
