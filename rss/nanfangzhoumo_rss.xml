(hereinafter referred to as Jinan Chengfa) has opened bids for a project - recruiting housing marketing agents. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The project is selling 1,341 units of commercial housing, with a total area of ​​about 166,000 square meters, involving 4 properties, and developers include Greenland, Longfor, Poly, etc. Based on the average listing price in September, the total value of these properties exceeds 2.8 billion yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is worth noting that these houses are all existing houses and are first-hand residences. The project tenderer, Jinan Chengfa, is not a developer, but an urban investment company engaged in real estate development and operation, and is 100% owned by the Jinan Municipal State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Not only in Jinan, on September 21, 2023, the Beijing Equity Exchange auctioned and transferred 154 properties. The transferor was the Beijing Chaoyang District Housing and Urban-Rural Development Committee, and the source of the assets was &quot;physical assets of administrative institutions.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Where do local urban investment companies and government departments get their housing from? Why are they for sale? &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;The product of &quot;competitive construction&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Lin Gang has worked in the Shandong branch of a national real estate company for seven or eight years. This time Jinan City Among the four properties for sale are projects of his company. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He told Southern Weekend reporters that the hundreds of units for sale in the project were resettlement houses built by real estate companies during land auctions, and were transferred to Jinan City Development after completion. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When the real estate market was booming in the past few years, real estate companies were vying for land across the country. In order to control land prices, local governments often limited the maximum price for land auctions. After the local auction reaches the maximum price, if the winner has not yet been determined, there will be a &quot;competition for self-sustaining&quot; and a &quot;competition for construction&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The so-called &quot;competition for construction&quot; means that after the developer&#39;s land quotation triggers the maximum price, it turns to competition for the construction area of ​​affordable housing. The one with the largest construction area is the winner. The housing provided is owned by the local government. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lin Gang recalled that the above-mentioned land was purchased around 2018. In order to successfully bid, the company built two buildings as resettlement houses in a community of two to three thousand households, which increased the cost by more than 60 million yuan. But after the house was put on the market, the market price dropped and the entire project lost money. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At that time, Jinan had just begun to implement &quot;competitive construction&quot;, which was still a minority in the country. Many cities usually use a lottery method to determine the winner after the land price triggers the maximum price limit. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lin Gang said that Jinan’s “competition for construction” has continued until now. In addition to the projects developed by his company, other properties sold in Jinan City Development this time are also the product of &quot;competition for construction&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;competition-to-build&quot; housing was originally used as local affordable housing. Especially since the State Council issued the &quot;Opinions on Accelerating the Development of Affordable Rental Housing&quot; in 2021, various places have accelerated the financing of affordable rental housing. Listings. In August 2022, Jinan Chengfa publicly purchased 3,000 units of commercial housing as rental reserves. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, Lin Gang admitted that the rental effect of the resettlement houses built by his company in the community was not good. The above-mentioned project, which was put up for sale by Jinan Chengfa, was completed in 2020. In 2022, I heard that two buildings would be used for lease by the government. The owners who had already moved in expressed their opposition and were worried that the mix of tenants would affect the community environment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Some owners have come up with a plan and want to build a wall in the community to separate the two supporting buildings.” Lin Gang said that the owners’ opinions were fed back to Jinan Chengfa. The other party did not agree. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Because there are no companies near the community, it is not convenient for office workers to rent here and commute. The rental rate of the two resettlement houses has not been high. For Jinan Chengfa, this means limited rental income. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Affected by the downturn in the real estate market, Jinan’s government fund income, which mainly comes from land sales, has been almost halved. Data from the Jinan Municipal Finance Bureau show that the city’s government fund revenue fell to 54.7 billion yuan in 2022 from 101.6 billion yuan in the previous year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“There have been very few land auctions in Jinan in the past four or five years.” Lin Gang said that under the influence of real estate regulation and the new crown epidemic, major real estate companies are shrinking, and Jinan’s land auction market continues to be cold. In order to maintain the team, his company has only acquired two pieces of land in Jinan in the past two years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In its prediction of the fiscal revenue and expenditure situation in 2023, the Jinan Municipal Government pointed out that fiscal operations are still in a state of tight balance, and the pressure to increase revenue, reduce expenditure and prevent risks is very high. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to alleviate the contradiction between fiscal revenue and expenditure, the Jinan Municipal Government proposed in the 2023 budget report to increase the profit handover ratio of municipal state-owned enterprises to 20%, and transfer the municipal-level state-owned capital operating budget to the general public budget proportion increased to 35%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For Jinan Chengfa, who has a house in hand, the income from selling houses is obviously more substantial than renting. Taking the housing listings in Huatongyuan Community in Greenland as an example, Anjuke showed that the monthly rent for a three-bedroom apartment of about 140 square meters is 5,000 yuan, and the rent per square meter is about 38 yuan/month. If sold, the new house price is 22,000 yuan/square meter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporters called Jinan Chengfa many times, but the staff declined the interview because the person in charge was not available. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Revitalizing idle properties&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Actually, this is not the first time Jinan State-owned Assets has sold commercial housing. In July 2023, the Dongcheng Yijia Community developed by Jinan Urban Construction Investment Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as Jinan Urban Construction) was put on sale. Another property owned by the company, Xijiang Huafu, also announced that it will be launched for sale in the second half of 2023. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the equity penetration, Jinan Urban Construction is 90% owned by the Jinan State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission and 10% by the Shandong Finance Department. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;These two communities are called &quot;civil servant communities&quot; in Jinan. Southern Weekend reporters consulted in the name of home buyers. The sales staff of Jinan Urban Construction Yi said that the two communities combined have a total of about 12,000 units, which were completed and delivered in 2016 and 2019. Half of the building was previously sold to civil servants, and the remaining half has been vacant until 2023. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among them, Dongcheng Yijia Community has more than 4,000 units for sale this time, and Xijiang Huafu has more than 1,000 units, which are expected to be officially launched after the National Day holiday. &quot;The two properties were originally off-plan properties and were sold internally by civil servants around 2013. The selling price was equivalent to the market price at that time.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At that time, Lin Gang was still working as a real estate reporter for a newspaper in Jinan. &quot;When I got to know this community, people had already chosen a house.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2009, Jinan hosted the 11th National Games and built a new Olympic Sports Center in the east of the city as the main venue. After the National Games, the Jinan Municipal Government also began to move eastward, moving into the Long&#39;ao Building, which is more than 100 meters away from the Olympic Sports Center. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Civil servants from Jinan Municipal Government units subsequently moved to Longao Building to work. Many civil servants did not have houses or lived far away. In order to meet the housing needs, two residential communities, Dongcheng Yijia and Xijiang Huafu, were built. Judging from the distance displayed on the map software, the two communities are both within 3 kilometers of Longao Building. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In October 2022, the Ministry of Finance issued the &quot;Guiding Opinions on Revitalizing State-owned Assets of Administrative Institutions&quot;, requiring the implementation of the government&#39;s tight living requirements and accelerating the revitalization and utilization of various state-owned assets such as houses, land, and vehicles. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Today, more than 5,000 units of existing houses have been put on the market in two communities, Dongcheng Yijia and Xijiang Huafu, and Jinan&#39;s property market has been shocked. &quot;This is amazing. The total number of online new houses signed in Jinan a year is only 40,000 to 50,000 units.&quot; Lin Gang sighed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The above-mentioned Jinan urban construction staff said that the current price of a small apartment of 95 square meters in Dongcheng Yijia is about 25,000 yuan/square meter, and the price of a large apartment of 175 square meters is about 29,000 yuan/square meter. Data from Lianjia.com shows that this price is lower than second-hand houses in the same area. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Because these two communities are all rough housing.” She said that in the two months since Dongcheng Yijia went on sale, more than 400 units have been sold. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lin Gang said that these two communities were built earlier, and the unit designs are not outstanding, which has also lowered the price to a certain extent. However, it has a superior location and is equipped with a high-quality school district. It is still popular after being listed and has a certain impact on surrounding second-hand houses. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The 154 properties transferred by the Housing and Urban-Rural Development Committee of Chaoyang District, Beijing are similar to those in Jinan. This batch of properties is located in the China Railway Construction International City Community, and the listing price is also lower than the price of second-hand houses in the same community. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the &quot;Economic Observer&quot; report, after the completion of China Railway Construction International City, some houses were repurchased by Chaoyang District Housing and Urban-Rural Development Committee and other units, with plans to use them to solve the housing problem of employees. Later, it was not fully implemented as planned, and some of the houses remain vacant to this day. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Staff from the Chaoyang District Housing and Urban-Rural Development Committee provided Southern Weekend reporters with the phone number of the person in charge, but no one answered the call. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(Lin Gang is a pseudonym at the request of the interviewee)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 29 Sep 2023 09:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[掰掰告别狮子林桥后，天津还有哪些快乐？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257898]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-29 08:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 29 Sep 2023 08:25:04 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[东亚家庭的悲剧与温情，全程哭着看完]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257890]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-28 23:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data-mpa-powered-by=&quot;yiban.io&quot;>;The son who has been away from home for many years suddenly received a call from his old man. How will he face the call from his mother who wants to take a posthumous photo and explain what happened after her death? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The documentary &quot;House of God&quot; from Taiwan starts with this phone call and reveals the painful past of a family. The son in the film is the documentary director Lu Yingliang. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/28/5e40d477465b42d4a99706cdccee27b2.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;1542&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/28/5e40d477465b42d4a99706cdccee27b2.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;252723&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The film is in Last year, it won four awards including the million-dollar first prize, the Best Documentary Award, the Best Editing Award and the Audience Choice Award at the Taipei Film Festival. It was also enthusiastically received during the film festival in Switzerland, and it also has a good score of 8.3 on Douban. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Because the film cuts into the native family from the director&#39;s perspective and shows every detail of rural life, many people compared it to the 2017 &quot;Four Spring&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, in addition to similar themes, similar perspectives, and both being filmed over a longer period of time, the emotional undertones of the two films are actually very different. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/28/551c0fa59ff4e2e0b15fb68fce76c31b.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;1620&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/28/551c0fa59ff4e2e0b15fb68fce76c31b.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;252724&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;《Four &quot;Spring&quot; is like a simple literary utopia. We long to grow up in such a family, enjoy the influence of music, and have a warm life like the director; and &quot;House of Gods&quot; reproduces another situation of East Asian families - There was no dialogue, they tortured each other, and after &quot;living&quot; based on instinctive consciousness, they escaped from this cursed place. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The mother who is thin and works all day long; the father who has nothing to do and is addicted to lottery tickets; and the brother who is just muddling along and accomplishing nothing. Director Lu Yingliang does not directly show the desperate state of these family members, but through a &quot;god&quot;. A rare perspective that reflects everyone&#39;s inner world. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the director&#39;s hometown, there has always been a strong belief in gods, and the Lu family attaches particular importance to it. They have a separate room upstairs for worshiping a shrine and an incense altar. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/28/355fc9f42b250a57564de8f63af746e6.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;613&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/28/355fc9f42b250a57564de8f63af746e6.png&quot; data-key=&quot;252725&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;All this source When Yu Lu Yingliang&#39;s brother was 12 years old, he suddenly became &quot;psychic&quot; and was chosen by the gods. He became a celebrity who traveled far and wide to seek guidance from gods. For many years after that, in addition to farm work, my brother also worked part-time as a fortune teller for others, and the Lu family became connected with the gods. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But through the director’s lens, we will find that family members have different attitudes towards gods. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although my mother is in poor health, she still climbs up and down every day to worship the gods. When asked repeatedly by her son why she persisted, she said lonelyly: &quot;In the past, when your brother left home, you and your father were not at home. Your sister went to work, and I was the only one left at home. They were all there to accompany me.&quot; Me.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/28/a599f88aa86a6400037aa147b2a4c52d.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080 &quot; height=&quot;604&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/28/a599f88aa86a6400037aa147b2a4c52d.png&quot; data-key=&quot;252726&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Unlike his mother&#39;s simple emotional sustenance, his father is utilitarian towards gods. He always wanted to guess the numbers from the smoke coming out of the incense and use it to buy lottery tickets. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;My brother, who has been dealing with gods for half his life, gradually fell into an embarrassing situation on camera. The film specifically uses the &quot;little tomato incident&quot; to expose the conceptual gap between the two generations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before planting tomatoes, my brother specifically asked the gods for instructions on the farming date. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/28/224bc1a4bc313d1d17b872c64c05f5a5.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;602&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/28/224bc1a4bc313d1d17b872c64c05f5a5.png&quot; data-key=&quot;252728&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But right here Not long after the fruit seedlings were planted, heavy rains for days flooded the farmland, but the gods did not play any role. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The young nephew was unwilling. He first said angrily that he had stopped believing in gods for a long time, but soon after, he burst into tears, hoping that his brother could ask the gods to find a solution. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The elder brother did not want to deceive his son, but in order to soothe the next generation&#39;s uneasiness and confusion, he could only pretend to have a breath with the gods, saying that Hua Tuo would greet his friends and solve the dilemma. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Here, God becomes the comforter of this ordinary family. When the family finds no hope in reality, the more they place their hope on the gods. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/28/9b655e87cb3cd81be4aa2e6434d3b5a0.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;604&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/28/9b655e87cb3cd81be4aa2e6434d3b5a0.png&quot; data-key=&quot;252727&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Like a director When my brother was doing farm work, he asked in despair and confusion: &quot;Do you really think God has helped our family? Or should I say, is there really a God?&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are few Chinese speakers. The film explores such metaphysical themes, not to mention situating this discussion among members of a rural family. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, we don’t need to compare &quot;House of God&quot; with religious films such as &quot;First Reformed&quot; and &quot;The Last Temptation of Christ&quot;. Director Lu Yingliang does not have this ambition. The reason why he Raising this question is based on his despair for his original family. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/28/efcf3ab445698828ae8311d7db21a9fb.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;604&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/28/efcf3ab445698828ae8311d7db21a9fb.png&quot; data-key=&quot;252729&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lu Yingliang&#39;s father He almost never fulfilled his responsibilities and only knew how to idle around. Even because of gambling debts in his early years, the whole family had to move. Although his elder brother was good-hearted, he lacked ability and failed to start his own business several times. He had to borrow money to pay off the debts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lu Yingliang had no choice but to work hard in a big city at the age of 18 and almost never came back because he knew that once he fell into this house of gods and men, he would become the same as those god tablets and become the entrustment of the whole family. &quot;hope&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From the beginning of the film until the middle and later stages, Lu Yingliang rarely appears in the picture. He basically communicates sparsely with his family in voice-over, and is full of confrontation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This situation did not change until my father was suddenly diagnosed with cancer. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/28/e1175bd37c5b0692749d2ef4e85ea3f8.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;601&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/28/e1175bd37c5b0692749d2ef4e85ea3f8.png&quot; data-key=&quot;252731&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lu Yingliang finally decided I helped my parents take photos of their deaths, and when choosing photos, I had a rare conversation with my father, and the family sat together, a rare moment of warmth and harmony. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I believe this scene will make many people cry secretly, because its tenderness uses the photo of the deceased (death) as a bridge to connect. The resentment that had been built up for many years gradually dissipated, not because the Lu family was on the right track, but because his father would eventually pass away. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is a sad ending for an East Asian family. Just like the recent &quot;That Time a Ghost and I Became Family&quot;, the father played by Tuo Zonghua finally opened his heart because Mao Bangyu had passed away. Regret makes people put aside their prejudices and their attitudes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/28/13e3dceb1b845daa801316bac97ef234.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;605&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/28/13e3dceb1b845daa801316bac97ef234.png&quot; data-key=&quot;252732&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;《神人Near the end of &quot;Home&quot;, Lu Yingliang finally returned to the home that had made him frustrated.

This change in perspective is clearly visible. This tells us invisibly that he no longer carefully observes himself and his family in a binary opposition, but chooses to recognize his former identity and accompany his mother on the endless coastline. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 28 Sep 2023 23:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[当幼儿园的儿子变得“社会”时，父亲在想什么丨养儿育女]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257882]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-28 22:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;My son, who is in the third grade of kindergarten, came back from school one night and told me in a low mood: Dad, I can’t do it tomorrow. Because I was talking to my classmates today, the primary teacher who was supposed to be on duty tomorrow was assigned to another classmate by the teacher. I said it didn&#39;t matter, there would be another chance in the future, and then I pulled him with a smile to get ready to play. Unexpectedly, my son scolded me for my passive and careless attitude. He said no, so he would do it one less time. He would not be able to talk nonsense to his classmates next time. I was stunned for a moment. It was really I wonder why he is so interested in being a little teacher. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Under my gentle questioning, my son told the truth that he wanted to be a primary school teacher: because this way he could control other children. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The answer surprised me. It was clearly a sign of a desire for power. I heard that this is a kind of power given by teachers to children who perform well in order to facilitate daily management. Children who serve as primary school teachers can help the teacher supervise other children, mainly in that they can criticize children with irregular behaviors. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I wanted to indoctrinate my son and tell him that this idea was wrong. As soon as I said one sentence, I was already lacking in confidence and knew that my dogmatic words would be contradicted by him. I changed my way of saying this: When you are a primary school teacher, you should serve the children. When you find a child making a mistake, don’t scold him loudly, otherwise the other person will be sad. You should speak in a gentle tone. The son said very maturely, I understand. It seems that he has become accustomed to the rules of this little teacher&#39;s game, which I did not expect. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He said that being a primary school teacher is sometimes difficult. Once, he and a classmate were both primary school teachers. His good friend was called out by the classmate when he was speaking. He wanted to be accommodating, but was rejected by the classmate. This made him very distressed and didn&#39;t know what to do. Another time, he criticized a classmate when he was a primary school teacher. A few days later, the classmate deliberately called his name when he was a primary school teacher. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I was stunned when I heard these stories. I was at a loss and felt very familiar at the same time. Isn’t this the epitome of the workplace for us adults, and it is too “social”. My son didn’t understand what I meant by “society”. I told him that what the other person did was wrong and you can’t do that. I asked a few friends who have children and they reported similar situations. The only comfort I can find is that such a mechanism can restrain children from some irregular behaviors in class, but it may not be effective. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Maybe children don’t want to become too “social”. Sometimes they have no choice like us adults, or they are trapped in it without knowing it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The mother of her son’s classmate told me something: Once, my son told her that one day her child was punished by the teacher at school to stand in the back of the classroom and talk to other children. She asked my son, how did you know, and he said without hesitation that the teacher made us stand while we were talking together. After listening to it, we burst out laughing. We were thinking about saying goodbye to others, but we suddenly exposed ourselves. Perhaps this is a contrast between &quot;society&quot; and innocence. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many times, children’s world is becoming adult, and children experience the rules and confusion of adult society prematurely. When we face our own problems, we usually appear powerless or messed up. When our children encounter the same situation, how can we expect them to be perfect? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When I went to pick up my son from school one day, he happily said that today he was on duty as a student. I thought to myself, what&#39;s so good about being a duty student? Isn&#39;t it just voluntary labor? But he told me that being a student on duty was to help the teacher sweep the floor and arrange chairs. It was a task assigned to him by the teacher, and it was a supreme honor. Thinking about children&#39;s &quot;society&quot;, there may be a gratifying point, that is, the threshold for happiness is very low. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Recently I watched a movie online called &quot;Goodbye, Our Kindergarten&quot;. In the movie, the kindergarten children sang a song at the graduation ceremony, &quot;We have spent countless days here. Every night, we laughed many times, cried many times, caught cold many times, we played here with so many dear friends, we ran here, fell here, fought here, goodbye to our Kindergarten, this is our playground.” The singing and lyrics moved me very much. Kindergarten should be a pure and happy playground, with less social fetters and worries. I recommended this movie to my son. He refused at first, but when I told him that it was about a few children going on an adventure to visit a good friend who was seriously ill, he expressed great interest. That weekend afternoon, because there was no Mandarin dubbing, I read all the lines to him with great emotion. After the movie ended, he said he was going to cry. I knew that he must have the same empathy for other people&#39;s sadness and happiness as the children in the play. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(The author is a worker in the cultural industry)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>; •&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;(&quot;Raising Children&quot; in the &quot;Hi, Southern Weekly&quot; column of the Southern Weekend App, welcome Write a letter to share the scenery and principles you have learned as a parent and teacher on the way your children grow up.

It seems that after being assigned the team names of &quot;War Wolf&quot;, &quot;Electric Wolf&quot; and &quot;Wild Wolf&quot;, people&#39;s wolf nature can be stimulated. The salesperson who doesn&#39;t like to exercise stacked up four layers of arhats without safety protection; the girl who usually speaks slowly and quietly yells &quot;Hello everyone&quot; while kicking in goose steps to compete for the glory of the team; to express her love for the company Out of gratitude, a team simply knelt down collectively. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The door to the conference hall was pushed open by the diligently practicing team members before 8 o&#39;clock in the morning, and was reluctantly closed until 1 o&#39;clock in the morning. Rehearsing exhaustingly, just so that one of the teams can show the most unique posture, the neatest steps, and the loudest slogan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The team building organized by the company made Li Yang a performer of spectacle. Before, he couldn&#39;t believe that he would show his style as &quot;falling headfirst&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Yang is a salesperson at a private lighting company. When he sees videos displayed by other teams on Douyin, he always sneers at those exaggerated actions. Unexpectedly, the person in the video now is himself. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On an ordinary weekend in August 2023, in Changzhou, Jiangsu, under the threat of salary deduction from the personnel department, Li Yang and more than 200 other colleagues boarded the team-building bus angrily. In the hotel where the team was built, they devoted themselves to all activities day and night, without any fear of leaving behind hoarse voices, bruised limbs, and colds, as if everything was done willingly from the beginning. The anger of being forced to &quot;work overtime&quot; and the 100 yuan of self-funded team building fees seem to be just small hurdles that need to be overcome in the process of &quot;soul sublimation&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The sublimation of training activities is to let employees learn to be &quot;thankful&quot;, which is the appeal of the company boss. Li Yang recalled that this team building did sometimes touch the soft hearts of some employees. Listening to the training instructor&#39;s exaggeration, an employee who had left his hometown had an epiphany with tears in his eyes: he should regard the company as his &quot;home&quot;; the boss carried two employees on his back and ran panting around the venue to simulate the &quot;hardship of starting a business.&quot; Li Yang will also feel compassion when he sees it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, reason reminded him that these sensational points are more like the fog lingering on the abnormal logic: &quot;The mentor said that the boss runs on the back of his employees, just like when he started a business, he carried the burden for his employees. Why do I think it&#39;s the other way around? It&#39;s obviously the employees who are carrying the boss&#39;s weight forward. The instructor just wants us to feel guilty and work hard.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Yang does feel guilty, but This has nothing to do with the company&#39;s favor, but more to do with one&#39;s own actions against one&#39;s will. He confessed that he did not understand the value of these games, but he became the component that maintained their operation; he knew the mentor&#39;s &quot;lies&quot;, but accepted his every instruction. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After leaving his previous company, this is Li Yang’s first year at this company and he has not yet established himself. He didn&#39;t dare to stand up and refute anything, &quot;I can&#39;t be the kind of person who dares to be the first in the world.&quot; Seeing a group of &quot;post-00&quot; colleagues sneak away in the night after experiencing the first day of training, Li Yang&#39;s feet were still nailed In place. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Those who stayed behind, like Li Yang, carried out their &quot;behave&quot; to the end. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Life and Death Grid&quot; with &quot;team collaboration&quot; as the training purpose: nearly 300 people pass through the same net hole one after another. If someone touches the net, everything will be cleared and restarted. The whole process lasted for more than 4 hours, with the supervisor interrupting again and again and the team members numbly repeating the devastating actions. Meditation designed to teach people self-reflection: While everyone was meditating in soothing music, a dozen training assistants suddenly rushed out of the darkness and cursed at the employees. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Yang doesn’t have many complaints about his boss, the initiator of team building. What he dislikes the most is &quot;Brother Guo Shi&quot;, the training instructor who issues orders and designs courses - a man in his forties with unknown educational background and qualifications, who calls himself &quot;the master&quot;. &quot;He likes to ask us closed-ended questions, and his catchphrase is &#39;understand the applause&#39;, just like a pyramid scheme.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias /image/23/09/27/lHBup7JvgoG3V87TLGXrNJ1Y9JzN0VMY92m0mYQl.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;534&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09 /27/lHBup7JvgoG3V87TLGXrNJ1Y9JzN0VMY92m0mYQl.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252392&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Employees of Li Yang’s company conducted a team presentation&lt;span style= &quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(provided by the interviewee/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Brother Guo Shi appeared with his head held high among a group of &quot;teaching assistants&quot; kneeling. On the podium, he emphasized that as long as Obey, don&#39;t argue, he has the power to eliminate anyone. A female employee in her fifties fell to the ground from exhaustion while being punished in a game (doing hundreds of push-ups). Instructor Guo yelled at those who came to help and urged the punished to complete it alone. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Instructor Guo is just one of the symbols of this closed venue. Along with him, suppressing the free movement of participants, there are banners hanging on the four walls: &quot;To love him is to strictly demand him&quot;, &quot;There is no you and me, only us&quot; &quot;If you don&#39;t provide results, the boss will bear the consequences&quot;; There is a game mechanism with bonuses for the top three, more than 200 uniform black T-shirts, and a queue shouting louder than the other. Li Yang explained, &quot;Although it seems absurd, in that environment, everyone did it, and you had no choice but to follow it.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/ cms/medias/image/23/09/27/WtiOFFAbblHFrnkf54zAo7rXxfnwuRJW8TuW6aFV.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;664&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/ 23/09/27/WtiOFFAbblHFrnkf54zAo7rXxfnwuRJW8TuW6aFV.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252393&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&quot;Today&#39;s team building is not training&quot;, “Team building is biased towards entertainment and has even been demonized”, “bad money drives out good money”, this is the evaluation of the current team building market by Xia Hui, general manager of the experiential training institution Renzhongren in South China&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa ;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The loneliness of experiential training&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;No matter whether the experience is good or bad, &quot;team building&quot; is something that most migrant workers avoid today. I am afraid of the shackles of the workplace. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is nothing new to rely on rationality to undergo certain magic operations in team building like Li Yang. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A steady stream of companies send their employees on team-building tours that are infuriating and humiliating. On the Internet, every once in a while, there will be hot searches such as &quot;slapping each other&#39;s face team building&quot;, &quot;kowtow to the leader team building&quot; and &quot;cruel survival team building&quot;. What was once shocking news is now commonplace. They seem to form a part of our country&#39;s workplace culture, to an extreme degree and in a stable state. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Today’s team building is not training”, “Team building is biased towards entertainment and has even been demonized”, “Bad money drives out good money”, this is Xia Xia, General Manager of South China Region of Renzhongren, an experiential training institution. Wei’s evaluation of today’s team building market. Rather than “team building”, people in the industry prefer to use “experiential training” to refer to these corporate team trainings designed to challenge oneself, build a team, and improve performance. Xia Hui said that &quot;team building&quot; was originally just the name of a course in experiential training. Because it is designed with low difficulty, broad goals, and high demand, it has gradually become the most popular type among peers. Among them, games and activities are the easiest to imitate, so &quot;team building&quot; has become synonymous with various activities of corporate teams. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The market is filled with all kinds of experiential trainers. Some, like &quot;Instructor Guo&quot;, specialize in corporate courses and are good at using chicken soup stories and game commands to establish themselves as authorities; some have switched careers from military training instructors and continue to enjoy the unique field control of this job in outdoor projects. more often, they act as &quot;tour guides&quot; in relaxed team-building trips. They rarely make guidance summaries, and their faces are vague in the minds of employees. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In China, there is currently no unified and official professional qualification certificate for experiential trainers to enter the industry. Training institutions set entry thresholds for trainers, and they all do so in their own way. Xia Hui said that perhaps we will see many &quot;team building alliances&quot; that have introduced some trainer assessment standards, but those are all &quot;private certifications.&quot; Renzhongren&#39;s trainers will undergo half a year of training courses and half a year of internal assessment before officially taking up their posts. Mr. Hu from Shaanxi relied on his previous experience as a military training instructor and self-study online to expand his training knowledge. He was able to work directly in a company he knew well. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lin Wei, general manager of Shanghai Zhongji Development, feels dismayed by the uneven qualifications of trainers. &quot;Some colleagues distort experiential training into military training and devil training. It is not like this. It should be relatively mild.&quot; What he deplores even more is the loneliness of the golden age of experiential training. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When experiential training was introduced from Europe and the United States to mainland China via Hong Kong 28 years ago, it was not as notorious as it is today. At that time, it was a niche, professional, high-level industry that was easily recognized by customers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To find a true etymology for experiential training, it is Outward Bound. “Outdoor Development” and “Outward Bound” were both its translation names. Overseas, its identity is not a business-oriented service, but an education model. Its predecessor was the Seamen’s School of the same name founded by German-Jewish educator Kurt Hahn in Wales during World War II. Hann believes that the one-month wilderness survival training can allow trainees to break through themselves, hone their will and form a close team bond through &quot;personal experience&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The first company in China to try something new is Renzhongren. In 1995, Renzhongren introduced Outward Bound to China, turned it into a corporate training business, promoted it in China, and registered the trademark &quot;Outward Bound&quot; for it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Industry insiders call the most prosperous decade of the experiential training industry at the beginning of the 21st century the &quot;Expansion Training Era.&quot; In 2004, when Lin Wei first entered the industry, experiential trainer was a profession with a halo. Most of those who came to participate in the first round of interviews with Lin Wei had a master&#39;s degree or above, including many with Ph.D.s and even university teachers who worked part-time during the winter and summer vacations. Undergraduate students with a background in education or psychology may also be selected, but it is best to have more than three years of work experience. After the first round of careful selection, the remaining 12 candidates will go to the base to receive a one-month training course. While attending class, he was eliminated. In the end, only five people were left in formal positions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What attracted Lin Wei to join the industry was the high salary and dignity that this career brought. In 2004, the average monthly salary of a white-collar worker was around 5,000 yuan, but a Shanghai trainer who gave 15 classes a month could earn a salary of more than 20,000 yuan. A course lasts for 1-2 days, and one trainer is responsible for leading more than ten students. Whether they are ordinary employees or wealthy entrepreneurs, they all respect trainers as &quot;teachers&quot; - not through preaching, but through guidance and encouragement, allowing students to transcend previously unreachable limits. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the classic project of high-altitude broken bridge, students need to climb an 8-meter-high shelf, walk on a broken narrow board, and jump from one end to the other. Of course, this is while wearing a fall arrester. Whenever students tremble at the take-off point due to fear of heights, Lin Wei would say soothing words on the edge of the bridge, teach them to take a deep breath, lower their posture, and tell them &quot;it can be done.&quot; During the review session, Lin Wei will summarize the students&#39; performance and explain the psychological mechanism behind the game, &quot;By breaking through situational pressure and expected pressure, people can get out of their comfort zone and grow.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Students and training The trainers were reluctant to leave when they left. They even cheered and threw the trainer high into the air. Lin Wei believes that &quot;obtaining such great recognition from people in such a short period of time is unmatched by other professions.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Today, Lin Wei can no longer see the reverence he once had in the eyes of his students. and admiration, &quot;They no longer call trainers teachers, but &#39;coaches&#39; instead. However, this is not a position for training people&#39;s skills.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to statistics from Kanzhun.com, currently, experiential training in Shanghai The average salary of a teacher is around 13,000 yuan. Lin Wei told Southern People Weekly that most of the original batch of high-quality trainers have now switched to in-house training (a type of corporate consulting that focuses on the right medicine and focuses on theoretical explanations). What left with them was Lin Wei&#39;s enthusiasm, a passion that &quot;sees that the peers around me are all excellent and I can learn a lot from them.&quot; He doesn’t understand why fitness coaches can also be trainers. “Physical fitness is not the focus. Improving mental understanding through experience is the purpose.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Experiential training has low investment threshold, high income, and market demand. Large, various activity courses are also easy to copy. The sinking of &quot;high-end industries&quot; has led to the industry attracting many profit-seekers, but there is a lack of internal regulatory constraints. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Customers favor fun activities and do not care about the &quot;training value&quot; behind them. To adapt to this, the proportion of business expansion training courses that require carefully designed outlines and emphasis on educational content is decreasing; the proportion of simple entertainment team building (such as simple games, fun sports, themed activities) is increasing. Entertainment team building accounts for 50% of Renzhongren’s business and as high as 70% for Zhongji. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lin Wei pointed out that current team building is like letting participants simply watch a movie. While watching, their emotions fluctuated greatly; after leaving the theater, what happened in the dark had no impact on their future lives. &quot;Actually, the sharing session after the movie is the most valuable. The previous training was to guide the students to talk about these &#39;movie-viewing experiences&#39;.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images. infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/EsBEbeEWTuyWxB7uIFakKT3iBXPjaMjNLP8a3lAZ.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;608&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/ medias/image/23/09/27/EsBEbeEWTuyWxB7uIFakKT3iBXPjaMjNLP8a3lAZ.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252391&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On a personal level, Kang Ying The team building she participated in was regarded as &quot;the cleansing of the soul.&quot; However, she firmly believes that team building cannot bring the relationship between employees and the company closer &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Team building is not that Important&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Kang Ying, who returned from the United States six years ago, was full of child-like desire to explore when she first came into contact with team building. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After graduating from college in 1999, Kang Ying has been working in the United States. He returned to China in 2017 and worked as a director in two domestic pharmaceutical companies. In recent years, she has unlocked team building, a unique domestic employee collective activity. &quot;I think it is very fresh and fun, so I am more involved.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To this day, Kang Ying is still grateful for the desert hike two years ago. The spiritual wealth that team building brought to her. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One day, 15 kilometers, Dunhuang Gobi. For Kang Ying, who doesn&#39;t usually exercise much, this is an astronomical figure. After learning about the team building content, she almost had the idea of ​​resigning. At that time, she was pulled into a WeChat group by the service provider, which was designed to prepare for the subsequent hike. The trainer requires employees in the group to clock in and start running one kilometer every day. Mileage gradually increases until 8 kilometers per day. Colleagues check in together and encourage each other. Kang Ying gritted her teeth and persisted. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This activity even helped her develop an exercise habit. &quot;It&#39;s hard to imagine that without this group, I would be able to run 8 kilometers alone. After that, I successfully lost 20 pounds and my whole body has reversed growth. It seems that I have really developed some perseverance.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p >;The long journey in the desert exhausted Kang Ying’s physical strength gained through running, and also allowed her to experience friendship. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The hiking activity starts at 7 a.m. and plans to cover 15 kilometers along the &quot;Xuan Zang Westbound&quot; route in 8 hours. After only 3 hours, Kang Ying could no longer move her legs. In her 46 years of life, she felt the despair of being physically exhausted for the first time. Looking up at the huge sandy slope, she paused in a daze. Suddenly a colleague&#39;s voice came from beside him: &quot;Don&#39;t think too much, step on this sand nest with your left foot, step on that one with your right foot, and climb up step by step.&quot; The other colleagues were not in a hurry and stopped to tell them Her knack for climbing. The trainer encouraged her while handing her water. The slope was finally over. The mutual-help friendship forged under difficult circumstances continues to this day. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;I thought about it afterwards, and it&#39;s the same at work. As a superior, when I need my team&#39;s subordinates to overcome difficulties, I shouldn&#39;t threaten them: If they can&#39;t do it, come see me with your head raised. . You should stand in their shoes and give more specific guidance. Even if it is as simple as &#39;step your left foot first and then your right foot&#39;.&quot; Kang Ying concluded. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On a personal level, Kang Ying regards the team building she participates in as &quot;the cleansing of the soul.&quot; However, she firmly believes that team building cannot bring employees and the company closer. Effects such as &quot;strengthening employees&#39; sense of belonging to the company&quot; and &quot;deepening their recognition of corporate culture&quot;, in Kang Ying&#39;s view, are all illusions created by team-building advertisements. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If the desert team building helped the company accumulate some goodwill in Kang Ying&#39;s heart, then this goodwill has been completely lost in the lazy working environment and workplace factional struggles. Kang Ying believes that the CEO&#39;s behavior is the factor that actually affects a company&#39;s corporate culture the most. If the CEO notices that his subordinates are blaming others, but fails to stop them, blaming behavior will continue to occur in the company. Kang Ying&#39;s direct boss in the company is the general manager, but she once received a message from the human resources department: the group CEO wanted her to be his eyes and ears - to report all the general manager&#39;s activities at any time, including his private life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When she thought that the leaders might be burying spies and scheming, but the company was always happy to organize team building and create a scene of concerted efforts, Kang Ying began to question the meaning of team building itself. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Also two years ago, the company failed in financing and carried out large-scale layoffs. Kang Ying lost her job. The mountains I climbed, the speeches I heard, the games I fought, and the philosophies I learned were like a dream, leaving nothing behind. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Kang Ying said that it is too reluctant to expect to gain a &quot;sense of belonging&quot; in the company through team building. If she can work in a company for more than ten years, she will naturally feel &quot;home&quot; about it. But in the past two years, she didn&#39;t know if the company would one day abandon her. A team building session cannot resolve this sense of crisis. Kang Ying believes that if employees show emotional dependence on the company, it is most likely a performance to &quot;show compliance.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sometimes, team building is not only a performance by employees to their superiors, but also a performance by the company to the outside world. A staff member of Renzhongren revealed that when many customers book experiential training services, it is more for promotional purposes. With an excellent video team, multi-camera shooting, high-end equipment, and skilled editing, team-building activities are recorded as blockbusters and become advertisements for recruiting new members. The actual feelings of the actors are not important, and it is not important whether the training purpose is achieved. What is important is to show to the outside world that &quot;this is an exciting and accomplished collective activity.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wearing a mask may be a survival rule for some people.

Take compulsory measures. Trading of the company’s shares on the Stock Exchange will be suspended from 9:00 a.m. on September 28, 2023, and will continue to be suspended until further notice.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A criminal law expert told 21 A reporter from Century Business Herald said that the content of Evergrande Group’s announcement was very clear. According to Evergrande Group&#39;s announcement, the company should have received a definite notice, and the notice characterized Xu Jiayin as &quot;suspected of illegal crimes&quot; and compulsory measures were taken. It is common sense to guess that when there is notification from relevant departments, the coercive measures taken are likely to be different from the &quot;residential surveillance&quot; that has been misreported by overseas media. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The above-mentioned criminal law experts said that in the context of the early stage of the China Securities Regulatory Commission’s investigation into Evergrande Real Estate and the public security departments taking criminal coercive measures against suspected criminals such as Du Mou of Evergrande Fortune, Xu Jiayin was suspected of illegal crimes. The results should not surprise many people. Public opinion has previously focused more on “when” to take action. Judging from the current public information, the issues he is involved in are likely to be related to multiple crimes. They are very complicated and may take quite some time to clarify. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A senior observer in the field of corporate governance told the 21st Century Business Herald reporter that Xu Jiayin had previously publicly declared high-profile slogans such as &quot;No one is allowed to lie flat&quot; and &quot;I can have nothing&quot; in 2021, but comprehensively considering all aspects, Judging from the information and reports, in fact, Xu Jiayin and his company said one thing and did another, tried to &quot;sit down&quot; at every turn, and threw the burden of resolving various problems and contradictions on society, leaving a mess that is difficult to clean up. From this perspective, it is no exaggeration to say that public opinion criticized him verbally and writingly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The above-mentioned observers pointed out that at this cusp of great pressure from all parties, Xu Jiayin was shouting slogans to deceive creditors, but at the same time he had a &quot;silent technical divorce&quot; with Ding Yumei. Due to the agreement of Evergrande Group to be listed in Hong Kong through the &quot;small red chip&quot; structure, among the more than 90 billion Evergrande Group has previously distributed in accumulated dividends, the British Virgin Islands and Cayman Islands are 100% controlled by Xu Jiayin and Ding Yumei respectively. The offshore company received most of the dividends through China Evergrande (03333.HK), and transferred them overseas before and after the accident. Through the &quot;technical divorce&quot; operation, it eventually fell into the pocket of &quot;overseas ex-wife&quot; Ding Yumei. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A senior partner of an accounting firm who is familiar with cross-border restructuring pointed out to the 21st Century Business Herald reporter that at present, Evergrande Group’s overseas debt restructuring may be due to Xu Jiayin and some senior executives being suspected of illegal crimes. The situation faces major changes. But whether it is domestic or overseas, whether the reorganization is successful or liquidated, I believe there are sufficient legal channels for domestic and foreign creditors to safeguard their rights and interests and pursue the responsibilities of Xu Jiayin and others. At the same time, the regulatory authorities are also likely to investigate Xu Jiayin and other executives&#39; illegal violations. The crime and subsequent investigation will be investigated and held accountable in accordance with the law. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 28 Sep 2023 20:55:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[刑事自诉小慧君诽谤立案：孙灏羽的“好运”可以复制吗？丨快评]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257796]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-28 20:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;There is new progress in the &quot;Xiao Huijun&quot; rumor-mongering sexual assault incident. Chidu Company founder Sun Haoyu recently posted on social media that the procedural issues in his criminal private prosecution case against Xiao Huijun for defamation have been resolved and will be heard soon. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the end of 2020, the well-known cross-dressing blogger &quot;Sien Xiaohuijun&quot; publicly accused her former boss Sun Haoyu of sexually harassing her online. Fortunately, Sun Haoyu later obtained evidence to prove that the so-called sexual harassment was just a rumor created by Xiao Huijun in order to terminate the contract with the company at a low cost. Including Xiao Huijun and several other contract anchors under Chidu premeditated and planned this rumor and slander incident in a group. After obtaining the evidence, Sun Haoyu filed a civil lawsuit against Xiao Huijun and others, which was supported by the court. The court clearly stated in the civil judgment that the evidence proved that the alleged sexual harassment was fiction, and ordered Xiao Huijun and others to apologize and compensate for losses to Chidu Company and Sun Haoyu. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Afterwards, Sun Haoyu filed a criminal private prosecution with the court, requesting that Xiao Huijun be held criminally responsible for spreading rumors and defamation. Initially, the court in Xiao Huijun&#39;s place of residence believed that it had no jurisdiction and ruled to dismiss Sun Haoyu&#39;s lawsuit. The higher court ruling published by Sun Haoyu this time determined that the court at Xiao Huijun&#39;s place of residence had jurisdiction and ordered the court to open the case and accept it. At this point, there is no obstacle to filing a criminal case against Xiao Huijun for defamation, and the next step will be to enter the formal trial process. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From being rumored to be sexually assaulted, to winning the civil lawsuit and the court confirming that &quot;Xiao Huijun&quot; spread the rumor, to finally filing a criminal private prosecution case, the journey has been difficult. In view of the frequent occurrence of similar rumors on the Internet, many netizens hope that Xiao Huijun&#39;s case will deter those who try to follow suit. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In recent years, there have been constant incidents of accusing others of sexual harassment or even sexual assault through online essays. However, many of them are difficult to distinguish between true and false, and some have been deemed by judicial authorities as lacking evidence or even being slanderous. For example, a female employee of a well-known large factory alleged that she was raped by a male leader, but police investigation showed that there was no rape. Recently, another host was also accused of rape, and police investigations revealed that the woman suffered from schizophrenia and experienced hallucinations and delusions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For these online essays alleging sexual assault, many netizens often choose to believe the parties involved for the first time. The reason is often that &quot;women will not use their innocence to slander others.&quot; However, many facts prove that in the face of interests, nothing is impossible. For example, Xiao Huijun did not hesitate to sacrifice her &quot;innocence&quot; in order to terminate the contract with Chidu Company at a low cost. There are also some people whose motives for slander are difficult for ordinary people to understand, and they may simply have mental problems. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After Xiao Huijun accused Sun Haoyu of sexual harassment, many netizens believed it to be true. Sun Haoyu and Chidu Company were bullied online and threatened offline. The company&#39;s door and front desk were smashed many times, and Sun Haoyu was always crowded when he went out. Followed by taking pictures and cursing. An MCN organization that was originally at the top of the industry has almost come to a standstill and is now unknown in the industry. A well-known host was at the peak of his career, but after being accused of sexual harassment, he was put into hiding, and his career and reputation were ruined. Although they won the lawsuit, their careers struggled to recover. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is extremely difficult for these men who have been falsely accused to defend their reputations. In civil litigation, it is difficult to obtain evidence recognized by the court. Sun Haoyu was lucky. Someone in Xiao Huijun&#39;s &quot;Blood Battle Chidu&quot; small group found his way back and provided the chat records Sun Haoyu needed. Zhang Heng, another well-known online article author who was falsely accused of raping an underage female fan more than ten years ago, has been unable to obtain the identity of the false accuser through legal channels, let alone prosecute. The accuser just wanted to make a famous person look bad, but he &quot;hidden his fame and achievements&quot; and didn&#39;t even reveal his true identity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Even if the civil lawsuit is won, the compensation received is very little, and the defendant&#39;s apology is often light and perfunctory, and the amount of communication of the apology is also very different from that of the false accusation. , it is difficult to clarify the facts and restore reputation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To deter rumors and defamation, the rumor makers must pay a greater price, such as criminal liability. However, the criminal law stipulates that spreading rumors and defamation is generally a private prosecution crime, and the victim needs to collect evidence and file a lawsuit. It is even difficult for victims to collect evidence for civil lawsuits, and it is even more difficult for criminal evidence that requires stricter requirements than civil lawsuits. Sun Haoyu was just lucky. He got the evidence and the verdict of winning the civil lawsuit, and he had more confidence to file a criminal private prosecution. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But Sun Haoyu’s good luck is difficult to replicate. In order for those who make false accusations and framers to be punished, the threshold for turning false accusations and frame-ups into public prosecutions needs to be lowered. As long as the victim makes a complaint, the case should be turned into public prosecutions and the police will investigate the case and collect evidence. In this way, we can intensify the crackdown on rumors and slander, protect the interests of victims, and maintain online order. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 28 Sep 2023 20:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[杭州亚运会：赛场内外，同样精彩]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257834]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-28 00:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;As of 17:00 on September 27, 2023, the Chinese delegation It is far ahead in the medal list of the Hangzhou Asian Games, with a total of 124 medals, including 69 gold medals, 39 silver medals, and 16 bronze medals. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;On September 24, 2023, Li Bingjie, who won the women&#39;s 1500-meter freestyle final, displayed her medal.&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/ image/23/09/27/ea98f3aa2a.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;721&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/ 27/ea98f3aa2a.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252480&quot;>;&lt;/p>;&lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On September 24, 2023, won the women&#39;s 1500-meter freestyle final championship Li Bingjie shows her medal. &lt;/p>;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The 19th Asian Games in Hangzhou will be held from September 23 to October 8, 2023, with a total of 15 competition days.

In order to protect people from all over the country who came to Zi for barbecue, as a member of the city&#39;s medical security team, he stayed on duty at the makeshift barbecue city for several days during the May Day holiday. The constant flow of people made him, an &quot;Old Zibo&quot;, feel unreal. The outside world kept saying that it was going to be cold, but it was always crowded every time he passed by the popular barbecue spot Ba Daji when he went out.

Just after the game ended that day, Dr. Sun gave his prediction for the passenger flow during the National Day holiday. &lt;/p>;&lt;p>;Because it was held in Zibo, this marathon was nicknamed the &quot;BBQ Marathon&quot; by runners. “As soon as I heard it was the Zibo Marathon, I rushed (to sign up).” After getting off the high-speed train at noon on September 23, Feng Yanhua made an appointment with fellow runners to have a meal.

The Children&#39;s Charity Association publicly stated that Ke Mouxiao was not its staff and had only served as a volunteer in the Hebei Langfang Team Cooperation Organization of the 9958 Project.

Because this kind of &quot;matching donation&quot; is a normal operation mode in the charity sector, and families of seriously ill children are accustomed to it, there is no doubt about the authenticity of the project initiated by Ke Mouxiao.

After a donor donates a sum of money to a charity organization, another donor (usually a company) will randomly or according to Donate a certain percentage of money to the same charity organization. The original intention of the matching donation model is to encourage the public to participate in donations. According to its original intention, the donation amount including corporate matching should not be used for the donor himself. &lt;/p>;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The Charity Law also clearly stipulates that when a donor and a charitable organization agree on the purpose and beneficiaries of donated property, the donor&#39;s interested parties shall not be designated as beneficiaries. &lt;/p>;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;But Li Shan has never heard of the above regulations.
