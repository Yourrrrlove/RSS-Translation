However, netizens in Shandong have posted When the tall man next to him came out, Heilongjiang netizens were not idle either. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Data show that in the national height competition between boys and girls, the height of boys in Heilongjiang ranks first, while the height of girls ranks first in Shandong Province. With the development of economy and life As the level increases, the average heights of men and women are 174 cm and 161.4 cm respectively. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Height has always been a topic of public concern. What kind of height is best in the eyes of the opposite sex? According to Polish scientist Pokryka, the standard for a perfect woman is an average height of 1.74 meters, and the standard for a perfect man is an average height of no less than 1.82 meters, with leg length equal to the length of the upper body, and a ratio of 1:1 that makes a man Looks stronger. However, the so-called perfect body standard cannot be generalized. In the era of aesthetic diversity, health has a standard definition. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So, what factors determine height? First of all, 70% of a person&#39;s final height depends on genetic factors, but in addition to genes, nutrition, exercise, environment, living habits, etc. all have a great impact on height. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, this is only an ideal standard. In reality, there are still relatively few situations that can achieve this state. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the current aesthetic trend of society pursuing height, many people will have height anxiety and try unconventional remedies to increase their height through injections, medicines, and surgeries. However, these methods have certain risks. . &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Today, &quot;Know&quot; kindly reminds you how we should treat the height issue rationally. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/16cf2dcb0158e649e618c3473a1cca4b.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;853&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/16cf2dcb0158e649e618c3473a1cca4b.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;252072&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/cac7600c61568750cf1f386f29749055.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width =&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;1439&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/cac7600c61568750cf1f386f29749055.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;252073&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/6845665a65be5d8656acc2e82b9870f3.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;1439&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/6845665a65be5d8656acc2e82b9870f3.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;252074&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p >;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/7499d3bd6e19e9fe5d1ed72624f40192.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;1439&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/7499d3bd6e19e9fe5d1ed72624f40192.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;252075&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt; img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/49969dc59efdd5d5c0defbdff8c53615.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;1439&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/49969dc59efdd5d5c0defbdff8c53615.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;252076&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src =&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/2522bcfd6ff43f2145542646209f877b.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;1439 &quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/2522bcfd6ff43f2145542646209f877b.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;252077&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot; https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/c6f26de596a834b79b4e9c493189113a.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;1439&quot; data -src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/25/c6f26de596a834b79b4e9c493189113a.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;252078&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 01 Oct 2023 12:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[“身心灵导师”学霸猫从者如云：哪类人最容易被收割？丨快评]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258010]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-01 11:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Recently, &quot;New Weekly&quot; reported on the &quot;body, mind and soul mentor&quot; Xueba Mao, triggering an investigation into the so-called &quot; Controversies and discussions about &quot;Zero Limit Cleansing Method&quot; and spiritual practice. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xuebamao taught his followers, such as &quot;People don&#39;t have to work hard, everything will go naturally and smoothly&quot;, &quot;Whatever you do should be easy, don&#39;t endure hardship, don&#39;t get entangled, follow your own preferences&quot;, smell Is it a little bit Lao-Zhuang and Buddhist? According to reports, the theory of &quot;Zero Limit Cleansing Method&quot; comes from &quot;At Zero&quot; written by American Xiu Lan in 2007. It is translated as &quot;Zero Limit: Hawaiian Therapy for Creating Health, Calm and Wealth&quot;, and the mantra is &quot;Sorry, Please forgive me, thank you, I love you.” Doesn’t it sound very positive? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Then, a group of young people who were inexperienced in the world joined Xueba Mao&#39;s &quot;body, mind and soul community&quot;. &quot;There are thousands of people, and more than 70% of them are women.&quot; Ordinary spiritual practices often teach people to control or let go of desires. Xuebamao does the opposite, allowing students or believers to buy without asking the price or looking at the labels. Debt does not matter. Xuebamao believes that in order to “clear away the fear of money, one must choose a method of flowing large amounts of money to open up one’s own energy.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many people believe in it and use their savings to buy or borrow money to buy what they like, and buy various courses and consultations from Xuebamao. &quot;With the expansion of the community one after another, there has been a trend of debt consumption among students. Living in a large flat, driving a luxury car, going to Xinrongji for afternoon tea, and constantly opening credit cards...Xueba Mao Dai With one bracelet, everyone will go to the same store to buy the bracelet. Not only that, everyone&#39;s speaking style is becoming more and more similar.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Who is Xueba Mao? In 2015, Mao Mao, a top student who graduated from the sociology department of a certain university, tried to start a business; around 2017, she found &quot;body, mind and soul practice&quot;. In 2021, the price of courses began to increase, and Xuebamao changed its original simple style, and the community was renamed &quot;Xuebamao·Hogwarts Lady Branch&quot;. A student discovered that her course had experienced several rounds of price increases, from 199 yuan to 999 yuan in the first quarter, and the price increased to 9999 yuan in the third and fourth quarters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This true story makes people feel a lot of emotions when reading it: First, the students believe in Xueba Mao’s spiritual practice theory and spend their own money to buy and buy in order to gain spiritual freedom. Xueba Mao Whose money does it cost me to buy flowers? In this real-person game, who is the real financial freedom and spiritual freedom? Secondly, spiritual cultivation is really a good business. As long as the seller makes people believe in his theory and himself, he can make the buyer &quot;use his body and his arms, and his arms and his fingers.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Furthermore, there is supply only when there is demand. The various spiritual schools on the market actually reflect the spiritual crisis, spiritual crisis and value crisis faced by some people in the modern social environment. To put it simply, it is because it is too short to enter modern society, and many people have suffered from many mental discomforts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is not to say that traditional societies do not have such crises, but that comparatively speaking, such crises are much less common in traditional societies. This is because traditional societies are basically in a state of scarcity, and people are busy working all day long to provide &quot;three meals a day&quot; for the whole family. In fact, &quot;three meals a day&quot; is just rhetoric here. Only in an era of abundant food can everyone live a healthy life. &quot;Three meals a day&quot; day. In this case, most people are mainly concerned about survival and have no leisure to pay attention to the so-called spiritual life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In modern society, everyone leaves the countryside where they are familiar and in their comfort zone and enters the city full of strangers. On the one hand, the income is much higher than that of their ancestors, and it is not a problem to have enough or even good food. Son, in addition to higher income, there is also more leisure. In fact, people cannot really let themselves be leisurely, so they will inevitably have spiritual thinking and pursuit. But on the other hand, natural blood communities such as families tend to disintegrate. Everyone in the city is atomized and scattered. We come into contact with many people every day at work, but how many people can we have close relationships with? Humans are social animals, which brings a lot of loneliness and insecurity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to get rid of it, some people will look for like-minded people online and offline. People with similar knowledge background or values ​​will come together, as well as common interests and hobbies such as fishing or playing games together. In short, we must &quot;talk with the same voice&quot; &quot;Response, seek each other with the same spirit&quot; to settle their own souls; some people throw themselves into the embrace of spiritual practice and the like. There are all kinds of methods, all of which are used by people to relieve or solve their spiritual atomism, loneliness and insecurity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From Chaoyang District Rinpoche to &quot;Master Wang Lin&quot; to various &quot;body, mind and spiritual teachers&quot;, the routines and profit models of these people are similar: I know that you are facing a spiritual crisis, a spiritual crisis and a crisis of values. , come on, lost lambs, children of lost souls, come to my arms and hand over your body and mind to me. I have the final and definite answer here. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Even the so-called &quot;body-body-spiritual guru&quot; also went through a process of spiritual struggle and internal consumption to enlightenment. &quot;Human, too human&quot;. His personal experience increases the credibility of the narrative and the &quot;truth&quot; he preaches. Credibility. At a certain stage, everyone will be happy, the student will get illusory spiritual freedom, and the mentor will get real financial freedom. But ultimately, you may not be able to live with self-deception and lies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Each of us must understand: Only by doing meaningful work and living a meaningful life can we discover the meaning itself, establish our own strong core of values, be simple and strong, and have the courage to explore. , to face and fight, for yourself and your family. All this depends on yourself and your family who truly love you. If you can&#39;t buy it, what you buy will be fakes and narcotics. It should be noted that spiritual weakness is the greatest weakness. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 01 Oct 2023 11:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[张艺谋——工作最happy，放假才emo]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257908]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-01 10:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 01 Oct 2023 10:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[编剧陈宇：把剧本写到张艺谋舒适区以外]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257754]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-01 09:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;On September 28, 2023, director Zhang Yimou’s first criminal police film &quot;Sturdy as a Rock&quot; will be released nationwide . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This film is also the beginning of the cooperation between screenwriters Chen Yu and Zhang Yimou. The script was written by Chen Yu. He originally wanted to film it himself, but after writing it, he found that he could not handle such a complex subject matter, so he approached Zhang Yimou and hoped that he would film it. After reading the script, Zhang Yimou liked it very much and immediately pushed back other projects and concentrated on filming &quot;Solid as a Rock&quot;. After filming &quot;Sturdy as a Rock&quot;, Zhang Yimou collaborated with Chen Yu in &quot;Amores&quot; and &quot;Sniper&quot;. The first one to be released was &quot;Sniper&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Because of his collaboration with Zhang Yimou in three blockbusters, Chen Yu was able to be seen by the public.

He works at 8 o&#39;clock every day When I wake up, I go to the movie studio to make movies and take classes. &quot;Three solid years.&quot; After graduating with a master&#39;s degree, Chen Yu applied for the Central Academy of Drama, where he studied under the famous theater director Cao Qijing and studied for a doctorate in drama principles and drama aesthetics. He is a typical academic school. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During his graduate studies, Chen Yu, together with several classmates, had some pioneering explorations of films with the CCTV Movie Channel. At that time, the movie channel was exploring the possibility of making some movies that could be shown on TV. This kind of style has already existed in the West. &quot;Film-made for TV&quot; is the so-called &quot;television movie&quot;, but in China , a TV movie has not yet appeared. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this context, Chen Yu served as a screenwriter and created a fantasy film &quot;8:35&quot;. This film became one of the most popular digital films on CCTV Movie Channel at that time, and also Therefore, it won the Lily Award for Outstanding Film. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Chen Yu is also one of the earliest practitioners of Internet film and television. In 2009, he filmed China&#39;s first commercial micro-film, &quot;Always Online: Love·Online&quot;. In this short film created for Japan&#39;s Dentsu Advertising and China&#39;s Lenovo Group, Chen Yu is both a director and a screenwriter. He uses storytelling to incorporate product concepts into it. This short film is considered to be the Chinese online movie with the highest Internet click-through rate in 2008. It also won the international first-line advertising award - the British Crystal Award for Best Online Movie of the Year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For a long time, Chen Yu stayed away from the film industry. He plunged into various film and drama theories. In his own words, “In order to create his own methodology, he must &quot;The two things of film and drama are combined together.&quot; He spent about ten years &quot;thinking behind the wall&quot; and finally established a systematic methodology. After that, he felt that he could create. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Sturdy as a Rock&quot; is a genre film that combines a police film + a crime film. For a while, Chen Yu was interested in anti-corruption cases. He saw an official performing his duties in the news, with his resume attached; and later saw news of his dismissal. Chen Yu would imagine this person&#39;s life course in his mind: In which period did he have a problem? What kind of problems could have led to such an ending in his fate? &quot;I think the certain qualities of human nature reflected behind them are very thoughtful and interesting.&quot; Thinking about it from this perspective, Chen Yu wrote &quot;Solid as a Rock&quot;. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/TB5fUcxCl2n1HoSurtzMVrzmIU08T6zkWWt9UaAz.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1920&quot; height=&quot;723&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/TB5fUcxCl2n1HoSurtzMVrzmIU08T6zkWWt9UaAz.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252346&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Chen Yu created the script &quot;Solid as a Rock&quot; out of his concern for anti-corruption cases.

For example, like &quot;Solid as a Rock&quot;, I blended two genres. One is the police and gangster genre, which is a messenger of justice such as a police officer or a detective. The truth of a matter, the thematic value behind it is the victory of justice over evil; another type is the crime type, which actually talks about a crime or how a crime occurs. &quot;Solid as a Rock&quot; I tried to fuse these two genres. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For me, the value of understanding and researching genre films is to be able to accurately understand the audience’s psychological process when watching a movie, including whether they can Get enough emotional and psychological satisfaction. So once we adopt genre film theory as the cornerstone and method of creation, we actually default to several things: first, the most important value and meaning is obtained from the perspective of the story; second, you identify with the audience. collusion&quot;. For example, when we make a horror film, we agree on some premises in advance - my film is a horror film, and it may not be so reasonable from the perspective of life principles, but do you agree with the assumptions I gave you? If you accept this hypothesis, I will definitely give you the psychological satisfaction that horror movies get. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/NZzdfPeAs03CqiLMUy9wuUvvM8uAmyDyYDkKrgTe.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1920&quot; height= &quot;718&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/NZzdfPeAs03CqiLMUy9wuUvvM8uAmyDyYDkKrgTe.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252349&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Screenwriter Chen Yu believes that the movie &quot;Sturdy as a Rock&quot; is a fusion of the two movie genres: police and crime. The picture is a still from the film. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Information picture/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: italics, Italics_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Are there many practical limitations in making crime films? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Chen Yu: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;He (the villain) must have a positive force to collide with him. It is not realistic to just write about how to commit crimes, because any Crime movies must be in a place where there is law and order, and he must be aware of his crime. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If it takes place in a place without order or in a place with semi-order, it is another type of film. For example, in a place with semi-order, it is a western. Westerns are set in a place where there is a little bit of order. For example, the Americans built railroads to the west, and then there was a small town with a police chief. The police chief was not strong enough and was often crushed by evil forces and criminal forces. Pressure, the conflicts and stories that arise in this semi-rule of law place. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;For creators, another problem they will face is , dealing with the ups and downs of the plot and taking care of the characters, which one comes first for you? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Chen Yu: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I will change this question into structure and characters that are important to me. I feel like the plot is actually a way the structure unfolds. Of course, as an audience, what we see on the first level is the plot, but in fact the structure behind the plot is determined, so the structure and characters are very important starting points in our creation. Aristotle made a distinction: Which is more important, structure or characters? Aristotle himself thought that he would start from structure. I am a follower of Aristotle, and I feel that what he said is something I agree with, that is, I will start more from the structure, but in the end I will reach the same destination as the characters. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You often mention &quot;hard-core narratives&quot;, For example, you said that Korean movies are a combination of three major elements - mature genres, directors&#39; strong styles and social issues. Are these three elements present in &quot;Sturdy as a Rock&quot;? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Chen Yu: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I’m working hard. &quot;Solid as a Rock&quot; is a standard genre format. It has its own characteristics in terms of storytelling, imagery, and narrative, and even has a certain authorial quality. Authorship is actually not inconsistent with genre. For example, Christopher Nolan is a very good Hollywood director. He also makes blockbusters and genre films, but he still has a strong authorial style. This is true not only in movies with a strong sense of form like &quot;Oppenheimer&quot; and &quot;Dunkirk&quot;, but also in standard Hollywood blockbusters like &quot;Interstellar&quot;. You will feel that it is completely different from Marvel&#39;s blockbusters. It has a clear storytelling method and character treatment. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You have talked about Chinese academic directors. In fact, This is not a manufactured concept, it is a real phenomenon. In your opinion, which academic directors are worthy of attention right now? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Chen Yu:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I will talk about some definitions of academic directors in my paper, but in fact we can broaden this concept a little bit, not necessarily He has to work in a university, because there are actually not that many people in this group, such as excellent directors like Director Cao Baoping and Director Xie Fei. To put it more broadly, an academic director is one who has strong self-awareness in film theory. The most prominent sign is that when he makes a film, he will place it in the history of film, the genre of film, and the status of film. There is a clear position in style, and he has a huge tree diagram in his mind. From the perspective of history, country, style, and form, he has the entire map. With this kind of consciousness in his mind, I think he can be Being called an academic director can also be equated with a scholar-type director to some extent. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He corresponds to another concept, that is, the studio director. A studio-type director means I don’t have to worry about that. I grew up on the studio. Many people have never even attended a professional film school. They just followed the master step by step. This was the case in the previous film industry, including films like Hitch. Directors like Kirk also used to draw background panels and do art work in studios, including Yasujiro Ozu. I think these two groups of people have different creative methods, working methods and even concepts, and both are likely to produce excellent authors. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Which directors do you prefer and admire? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Chen Yu: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;When I was in film school, I was most fascinated by Martin Scorsese. At that time, I was obsessed with audio-visual language and film forms. The forms of Martin Scorsese&#39;s early works were extremely wild and unconstrained, and they had their own style and characteristics, so my graduation thesis at that time was about Martin Scorsese&#39;s films. Research; For a long time after that, I was more fascinated by Hitchcock, who was a super master of telling stories; in recent years, I admired Orson Welles, whose &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; In the 1940s, narrative, profundity of thought, understanding of human social life, including politics, private life, and so many other things were perfectly put into one movie. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;My job is to say things outside your comfort zone&quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font -family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;&quot;Solid as a Rock&quot; is the beginning of your collaboration with director Zhang Yimou. How big of a span is there between the end of &quot;Sturdy as a Rock&quot; and &quot;Man Jiang Hong&quot;? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Chen Yu: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Soon. The order was to do &quot;Solid as a Rock&quot; first. At that time, director Yimou and I met and we worked together. Later, the director said that Chen Yu was good, so we continued to work on it, and proposed the motion &quot;Man Jiang Hong&quot;. After the synopsis of &quot;River Red&quot; was written, &quot;Sniper&quot; was temporarily inserted. We finished &quot;Sniper&quot; first, shot it and released it, and then went back to expand the synopsis of &quot;River Red&quot;. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Generally speaking, during the cooperation, everyone may be familiar with each other and agree with each other&#39;s abilities and characteristics, so he said every day, &quot;We have a good script, and you have to hurry up. You have to work hard.&quot; In fact, I have been trying to keep up with him, but now I am not the only one who can&#39;t keep up, his pace is too fast. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/oBeBMIn0wqFzyvd86WW2NgF8d4FE249Z4GtHmKpG.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1920&quot; height= &quot;719&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/oBeBMIn0wqFzyvd86WW2NgF8d4FE249Z4GtHmKpG.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252348&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The movie &quot;Sturdy as a Rock&quot; is the first police crime film directed by Zhang Yimou.

The key is, it&#39;s not that he uses a strong will to force himself to work hard, but that he likes this thing. Doing this thing is happy, comfortable, resting and working for him. Sometimes I say we should go on vacation somewhere, let’s visit the country and abroad, and he says, “I won’t be happy there, it’s not a vacation for me.” It&#39;s basically impossible to leave him idle for more than a few days, so his (overall) tempo will be fast. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You and director Zhang Yimou’s narrative aesthetics or your impression of the film There must be differences in understanding. Will there be any disputes over this? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Chen Yu: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;First of all, regarding my cooperation with him, I have a learner’s mentality. We learned movies by watching his movies, and we truly recognized his previous achievements from the bottom of our hearts, so in this state, I stole from him. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, we have different opinions on how to handle some scenes. At this time, he also mentioned it and I also mentioned it, and everyone pulled the bellows back and forth, but generally in the end The time is almost up. I will write a whole article about why I am like this on this issue, listing several possibilities, the advantages and problems, and give them to the director together, and the director will make the final decision. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I told him that my job is to give you the possibility to say more, to say things outside your comfort zone. He has a very large comfort zone, much larger than that of ordinary people, and he can do all kinds of things very smoothly. But what is my responsibility? I said I have to give you something different. Maybe what I mentioned is not necessarily the best choice in my opinion, or maybe your own decision is the best choice, but I have to list this possibility. , in the end you make the choice, this is the director’s responsibility. I also believe that he will make the most appropriate choice. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;After the actors are selected for a movie, you will focus on the actors. Any changes to the script? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Chen Yu: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Yes, we can basically do this work for such mainstream movies or large industrial-level movies. , including &quot;Man Jiang Hong&quot; too. Director Zhang Yimou said, &quot;Before you act, you will follow the play, and when you are acting, the play will follow you.&quot; I think he said it very well. I used to be a director myself and made some small films. I tried my best to imagine the actor&#39;s state in my mind very accurately. Even after counting for three seconds and asking him to say this sentence, the actor would be at a loss. Now that I think about it, I have a problem. Performance is an organism, and you cannot turn a person into a robot. He should have his own thoughts, his own coherence, and his own rhythm and beat. At this point, I was impressed by the director Yimou. I learned a lot from him. He has many tricks on how to present a scene. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Will you change the lines on the spot? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Chen Yu: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;If the script is still undergoing major changes by the time filming starts, it will not start filming, so basically it will be finalized when filming starts. More adjustments are the state of some performances, or the rhythm, or the changes in the tone of speaking. Sometimes there will be some small adjustments to the lines, but generally they won’t change much. This is also a kind of scientific nature of director Yimou’s work. We are similar in that we don’t believe in on-site or temporary inspiration. He even Intentionally reject such inspiration. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, the filming started in a week, and I suddenly had a very good idea about this scene. I said that this scene would make a big difference. As a creator, Everyone would be very excited, but Director Yimou was very calm and said that your idea is a good idea. If you proposed it three months ago, you would start adjusting it immediately. But now that the filming starts in a week, there is not enough time for digestion. I&#39;d rather keep this thing now. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is a lesson I learned that had a great impact on me. I think this comes from a long experience. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;After &quot;Amores&quot;, &quot;Sniper&quot; and &quot;Sturdy as a Rock&quot;, Will there be a next installment in the &quot;Chen Zhang Series&quot;? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Chen Yu: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;We are working on it, planning and writing. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;This combination will become the only option for your creation ? Is there any movie of Chen Yu’s own? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Chen Yu: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I think there will be. Of course, I particularly hope and am willing to continue my cooperation with Yimou, and I will try my best to follow in his footsteps. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“You don’t need to write a script”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312 , STKaiti;&quot;>;Many movies in the past were adapted on the shoulders of literature, but now, the movies you make yourself, including the movies you collaborated with director Zhang Yimou, are all original scripts. Is this habit formed naturally? , or is it an option? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Chen Yu: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;In fact, I think the creation of movies, specifically the creation of texts, has nothing to do with literature. I prefer movies and Literature is two things. We can draw nutrition from literature, but this nutrition may not be unique to literature, such as understanding of society, understanding of people, understanding of human emotions, and understanding of multiple models of character relationships. These things In fact, it can also come from life. It’s just that literature is doing this effectively and has been doing it for a long time, and it is most convenient for us to obtain these things from it. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But I think the form of literature itself and the text of a film are two completely different things. Even today when I recruit graduate students, students often say that I have been a literature lover since I was a child. The writing is very good. In my case, when I say that your writing is good, it is not an advantage of writing a script, but it is even a disadvantage of writing a script. Because your writing is good, you will use it to cover up the deficiencies in characters, plots and actions. It seems that you have written in a flashy way. Those things are of no use to our movie. I have to pick them up and take a look. What is the dry stuff? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So I say that writing a script does not require writing or rhetoric. My own script has no adjectives. It is all about people, actions, and lines. A 30-year-old person, what kind of clothes he is wearing, comes over and sits down. Say...that&#39;s it, without any literary description. If a student comes to me, for example, a man is sitting there eating noodles, showing a melancholy mood. Then I say that melancholic emotions should be deleted. What does depression feel like? You have to show me what he did. Words like melancholy are all literary thoughts, and what I want is visible and concrete expression. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;We know that there are many models in the film industry that are very mature. Will it be replaced by ChatGPT and artificial intelligence one day? Is there anything in this that artificial intelligence cannot replace? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Chen Yu: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;This question is also a question that everyone is thinking about recently. Will artificial intelligence replace some of the film industry after it comes out? My feeling is that it will, but the way it replaces is to replace it back from the terminal. In other words, things that are more technical and procedural, such as computer special effects and face-changing. Nowadays, AI is used to change faces, and calculations of computer special effects are gradually being mastered. I even think that in the next 5 to 10 years there may be some (smart) photography, where I say a few words and keywords, and the image is basically generated for you first, and then you can Make adjustments. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But I think going back to the earliest stage, the planning and production of the story, it is still very difficult to replace it. From a philosophical sense, the most basic things are difficult to produce by ChatGPT. It is impossible to create. It is just a patchwork and combination of existing information. As a creator, the greatest value of what you have to do is to bring this universe Take out something that has not been there before, and it has a specific meaning. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You once criticized Hollywood&#39;s high-concept movies, which are to create audio-visual spectacles of those movies. The Chinese market has indeed experienced a great change in recent years. Chinese audiences used to be very fond of this style, but now things have changed. Movies with classic narratives or themes that are more closely integrated with local elements have defeated the Hollywood model. Is this &quot;defeat&quot; due to a change in audience tastes, or is it that Chinese creators have really come up with something better? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Chen Yu: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Essentially, I think high-concept movies are generated by the thinking of the modern advertising industry. They use a specific element of the movie as a production Justification for a movie. For example, the earliest reason for making a movie is that the story is good, I enjoy watching the story, or the character is interesting. These are relatively classical psychological needs. But after high-concept movies, probably around the 1980s, the concept of blockbusters appeared, which was different. It was advertising thinking. For example, I made this movie not to tell a story, but to show clothes. I showed the clothes from a fashion perspective. This element is higher than the story and the characters. After watching my movie, you may I was not satisfied with the story, but I saw fashion and fashion in it. Gradually, high-concept movies have become. I have many reasons to make a movie, such as special effects and audio-visual shock. Even if the story and characters are a mess, it doesn&#39;t matter, as long as the special effects are good. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Advertising thinking is my own summary of the essence of these high-concept movies. Is this wrong? Yes, but what I am more disgusted with is that it is only this, or it is not enterprising, the originality is getting lower and lower, and it is constantly repeated. For example, I don’t particularly appreciate Marvel movies, including a large number of sequel movies. They essentially pursue extreme safety, cannot take any risks, and stifle originality. The current mainstream Hollywood movies make me very worried and disappointed. This is not to say that in our Chinese market today, our domestic films have far surpassed them. In fact, on the one hand, domestic films are improving, and on the other hand, it is their own fault. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;High-concept movies were popular for a long time from the 1980s to the 21st century, but now they are slowly changing. The Chinese film market, including the international film market, has gradually returned to a recognition of the value of narrative. This It&#39;s a change that I&#39;m very happy to see. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 01 Oct 2023 09:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[月亮山：风车、云海与斑斓霞光 | 眼睛在旅游③]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257599]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-01 08:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 01 Oct 2023 08:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[在新疆与银河“合影”丨指尖华夏②]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257581]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-30 23:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;In Hami City, Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, the stars in the sky are like diamonds embedded in the sky, emitting bright light and beautiful. .

&lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The situation of women is a theme that runs through almost all the film and television works of director Li Shaohong. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Information picture/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A mother-in-law who devotes herself wholeheartedly to her son and grandson and lives without self, a mother-in-law who works hard in life The daughter-in-law looking for herself in the cracks of the epidemic in 2020, the sudden epidemic, these &quot;natural enemies&quot; who were hit by the epidemic were isolated at home, and they had a rare closed space that only belonged to two people...&lt;/p>; &lt;p >;This is director Li Shaohong&#39;s presentation in the movie &quot;Her in the World&quot; to be released in September 2022. The original intention of the film was to tell the story of the impact of the epidemic on women at home. Li Shaohong recalled that in May 2020, the producer came to see her. At that time, everyone was still in the first wave of the epidemic, wearing masks, and did not know each other. It was difficult to find a coffee shop, but they did not dare to sit in it. We were talking in the corridor outside with the cold wind blowing - it was still cold in spring in Beijing at that time. The other two directors of the film are Chen Chong and Sylvia Chang. Li Shaohong said: &quot;Our combination has a bit of a Detachment of Women feeling. Me, Chen Chong, and Sylvia Chang, we are all women, and the producer is also a woman.&quot; In the end, the film uses three stories. , showing how ordinary people find love and hope in difficult situations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before &quot;Her in the World&quot;, in 2021, in the female monologue variety show &quot;Hear Her Say&quot;, &quot;Yun Zhongzhuan&quot; directed by Li Shaohong tells the story of a baby girl from a family of craftsmen who was forced to change her gender. , living as a boy. Because he was raised as a boy, he developed gender cognitive impairment and missed his love. She sacrificed herself and became a major contributor to the revival of her family&#39;s &quot;Guangcai culture&quot; (Guangzhou woven gold-colored porcelain, now a national intangible cultural heritage). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Shaohong recalled that the prominence of the female perspective in his works went through a process from self-repression, unconsciousness to consciousness. The first film of her directorial career, &quot;Silver Snake Murder&quot;, is a genre film with strong personality and strong style. &quot;At that time, I felt from a certain perspective that I can do what men can do. This What the genre requires is my standard.&quot; She told Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The emergence of her true female consciousness began with the filming of &quot;Bloody Morning&quot; in 1990. The inspiration for the story is taken from Marquez&#39;s novel &quot;A Premeditated Murder&quot;, but in fact, Marquez&#39;s story only provided an excuse for Li Shaohong. Human issues such as marriage and women&#39;s lack of self-awareness are what she really wants to show. In 1995, when he filmed &quot;Red Pink&quot; (adapted from Su Tong&#39;s novel of the same name), Li Shaohong used the perspective of two women with fireworks in the old era to tell the story of how they chose their own destiny and life path under the torrent of the times. The film was shortlisted for the main competition unit of the 45th Berlin Film Festival and eventually won the Silver Bear Award for &quot;Outstanding Achievement&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The 2000 &quot;Da Ming Gong Ci&quot;, to some extent, is the culmination of Li Shaohong&#39;s female perspective. This TV series has a score of 9.1 on Douban so far. Li Shaohong attributed this to &quot;considering the existence of historical figures from a female perspective&quot;, which also makes &quot;Ci of the Ming Dynasty&quot; different from previous historical dramas. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After experiencing the reputation controversy of the TV series &quot;A Dream of Red Mansions&quot; (2010 version), for nearly ten years, Li Shaohong, as a director, rarely appeared in the film and television industry. During this period, she served as the president of the Chinese Directors Association and launched the &quot;Green Green Project&quot; to shift the focus of her work to supporting new talents. Thanks to the &quot;Green Green Project&quot;, the works of a group of new directors, especially female directors, have surfaced. Director Bai Xue&#39;s debut film &quot;Spring&quot; is one of the representatives. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Rediscover the existence of the other party&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;《世世&quot;With Her&quot; sets the timeline in the special year of 2020, showing the story of a mother-in-law and a daughter-in-law who fell ill during the epidemic. How could you think of setting such a time and such a female relationship? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Li Shaohong: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;It was during that time that everyone returned to their families. Usually we seem to be trapped by external affairs, all the goals we strive for, and the pressure of various jobs in society, and we neglect our family. When you encounter such a difficult period, you suddenly face your life, your relatives, and your role in the family. You will feel how important they are, and the feeling of dependence on each other is particularly strong. I naturally thought that from a female perspective, the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law in the family are very representative. It is precisely because they themselves are ill that they can reflect a woman&#39;s sense of self-existence and the importance of her sense of family existence. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Most of the relationships between mother-in-law and daughter-in-law in previous film and television dramas were Full of contradictions and hostility, the relationship between mother-in-law and daughter-in-law you showed in the film was not harmonious at the beginning. By the end, we saw a warm flow and understanding between women. How did this change occur? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Li Shaohong:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Generally speaking, people will think that in traditional and modern families, the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law are incompatible with each other. Many movies and TV shows The conflict between them is also expressed and reflected in the work. In fact, I think these two female characters have a lot of functional overlap: they are facing similar objects, son/husband, grandson/son, their ultimate goal is the same, they are all expressing an expression of love. , but if the expression is different and the focus of consideration is different, conflicts will arise. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I will give you an example of giving hairtail in the film, which is very typical. There are two families. The daughter-in-law played by Zhou Xun grew up eating fish without scaly eating, but in her husband&#39;s family, the mother-in-law grew up scaly, and there was a conflict between mother-in-law and daughter-in-law because of scaly eating. So while delivering hairtails, she called her husband to complain. Her husband didn&#39;t understand her complaints, so she was very angry and felt that she had nowhere to put her emotions. In fact, it is not about the hairtail, but the lack of sincere understanding between each other that causes conflicts between husband and wife and between mother-in-law and daughter-in-law. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhou Xun repeatedly told her &quot;husband&quot;, &quot;You don&#39;t understand things between women.&quot; Later, she stood on the overpass in a daze, not knowing what to do. She wanted to be quiet and digest it by herself, and finally return to her family. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I have this kind of experience myself, especially when I don’t know what to do. But after you came back, you found that no one in the house, from the adults to the children to my husband, noticed that I had gone out. The few hours I left had no impact on the family, so I was very upset, but you can only digest it yourself. In the end, I couldn&#39;t help but say, &quot;Didn&#39;t you realize I wasn&#39;t here just now?&quot; It was very embarrassing. My husband said: &quot;Really, where have you been?&quot; With such a simple sentence, you feel that the value of this existence is not realized by others. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This kind of life experience may be experienced by every woman in life, but this time it is just seen on the screen. In fact, her husband was not aware of it, and no one was aware of her psychological changes. Later, when she returned home, her mother called, and she still used the state of saying that nothing had happened, like a little girl, to comfort her parents, &quot;Nothing happened, everything is fine.&quot; This touched her mother-in-law, and she realized how neglected they were towards each other. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“This is the feeling I want to express”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312 , STKaiti;&quot;>;As you said, there is a very important keyword in &quot;Her in the World&quot;, which is women&#39;s self-discovery, or self-understanding. This background runs through most of your works. In 1988, it was not obvious in your first film &quot;Silver Snake Murder&quot;. It was a very &quot;hard-core&quot; drama. Some even commented that it was more vigorous and spicy than the works of male directors. Many People speculate that among the male-dominated group of directors, did you deliberately hide your female identity? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Li Shaohong: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Yes, although it was already an era when women held up half the sky and advocated equality between men and women, it would allow you to put your The standard is to consider issues from a public perspective that downplays one’s own gender. In addition, &quot;Silver Snake Murder&quot; is a genre film. Genre films have no gender expression, so it must still have a genre perspective. At that time, I felt from a certain perspective that I could do anything a man could do, and the requirements of this genre were my standards. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;This transformation from unconsciousness to consciousness is How did it happen? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Li Shaohong:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I experienced a big, conscious change in my self-awareness when I was filming &quot;Pink&quot;. When we first adapted Su Tong&#39;s novel, we went through a collective creative process. The screenwriter was Mr. Ni Zhen, and basically all of our main creators were men. The creative perspective initially focused on society’s transformation of these two prostitutes. In the process, I felt that it seemed to be getting further and further away from my earliest interest in this novel. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When I was about to shoot, I looked back and thought about what was the first impact Su Tong’s novel had on me. The most original impact was not how to transform them, but how they accepted the times. changes and transformations, and then how they choose their own destiny and the path of their own lives. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During the filming, I did a bold job, focusing all perspectives back on these two girls - how they were taken away by the boat one morning, how they How do they view the men they like, why Qiuyi chose to be a nun, how Xiaoe chose to live with this man, and how are their lives going? After the whole perspective was reversed, I suddenly felt that this was the feeling I wanted to express. All the experiences and feelings of the two women at that era have become the biggest feature of this film. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the film was finished, it won the Silver Bear Award for Outstanding Achievement at the Berlin Film Festival. Then, in 1995, the World Congress on Women was held in China. After I participated in this conference as a representative, many The confusing question suddenly found the answer. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;For example? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Li Shaohong:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I realize that if your standard is set on a male standard, and you especially want to follow a public consciousness, When you think about problems, you don’t think about them with individual consciousness. What you think about is a collective sense of existence, not an individual sense of existence. All these questions seem to be gradually guiding you, asking you to measure yourself according to other people&#39;s ideas and social requirements, as if your own existence is not aware of and valued, and you should restrain yourself. I was really surprised. I was sweating. I thought, God, how did I think about problems in the first half of my life? I never thought about myself. Is it a bad thing to think about myself? It doesn&#39;t seem wrong. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At this time, I realized that when I was filming &quot;Pink&quot;, I had secretly thought about problems for women themselves, as if this was not wrong, and this inspiration and enlightenment was really right. I am too important. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/09/15/fWOCPsR6IrUDsMVmhAdDVpIcNw3WzOqQRF6VmnUS.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1453&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/09/15/fWOCPsR6IrUDsMVmhAdDVpIcNw3WzOqQRF6VmnUS.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;208820&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Zhou Xun and Li Shaohong have collaborated many times. The picture shows Princess Taiping (right) played by Zhou Xun in &quot;Ci of the Ming Dynasty&quot; (2000) to avoid marriage with Turks. A scene of a shadow puppet show performed by a Taoist nun in the temple. Princess Taiping has only a few entries in history books, but in Li Shaohong&#39;s works she becomes the protagonist who observes history. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;Considering the existence of historical figures from a female perspective&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong >;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;&quot;Da Ming Gong Ci&quot; can be said to be a masterpiece of expression from your female perspective, because before it, all historical dramas were dominated by men. The protagonist. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Li Shaohong: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Yes, because most historical dramas are from a historical perspective, and history is written by men, so naturally you use Tell stories from this perspective. After I gained this awareness, I consciously spoke from a female perspective, so you can see that I am talking about Wu Zetian and her daughter Princess Taiping. How did these two women control their own destiny in that era? . &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Daming Palace Ci&quot; actually starts from Wu Zetian as a mother. The first child she gave birth to was a girl, who was strangled to death. Later, when she was 38 years old, she became pregnant with Princess Taiping, and she insisted on giving birth to her. All her subsequent actions towards Taiping were all caused by her compensation for herself and the child she had strangled to death. Princess Taiping is described in only a few sentences in &quot;Zi Zhi Tong Jian&quot;, which can be summarized as &quot;arrogance, extravagance and lewdness&quot;. But I think her reason is caused by the doting given to her by her mother. It is the original sin caused by self-salvation and mother&#39;s guilt. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From all these angles, I think they consider the existence of historical figures from a female perspective, which also makes &quot;Ci of the Ming Dynasty&quot; different from previous historical dramas, which were rated as &quot;alternative&quot; at the time. . This shows that a historical figure has never been told from a female perspective. Maybe everyone did not recognize the existence of this drama at the time. This sentence saved me at the time, because when this show was first released, not everyone applauded it. Everyone is particularly questioning: Is this a historical drama? But its strong emotion and style make everyone find it refreshing, and they don’t know how to evaluate it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;From your perspective, how do you interpret Wu Zetian? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Li Shaohong:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;We don’t care whether Wu Zetian was an emperor in the end. At the beginning, she did not have this dream. Ordinary women living a good life. At that time, they were sent to the city to participate in the draft. This path was what girls of that era aspired to. From this perspective, her experience is the struggle history of an ordinary woman. She wanted to find a more ideal emotion in it, and then she found it. She cherished it, otherwise she would have almost been buried with her. In fact, she had been assigned to a nunnery, where she almost had to spend her life in a life worse than death. She tried every means to let others discover her existence. I think as a woman, this instinct of begging for survival is not an exaggeration at all. After she gets the possibility of survival, does she have to hold on tightly? She must try her best to manage it well, otherwise, she is likely to return to a situation where life is worse than death. All of this, I think about from the perspective of this woman’s survival and struggle. She really uses all her wisdom and ability to manage her family and husband-wife relationship. This is not wrong at all, and it is not simply He judged her as a poisonous woman. When survival pushed her to a desperate situation, she was forced to do it. And when her position was truly stabilized, the first person she wanted to repay was her child who died young. This child has always existed in her life, so she put all her guilt on the 38-year-old Princess Taiping. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Wu Zetian lamented about her male favorite, &quot;A As long as you put a man into a woman&#39;s situation, he will become a woman.&quot; This is also a line that has not been seen in previous historical films. Looking at the issue from a female perspective, where did this line come from? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Li Shaohong: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Just think in other people’s shoes, Wu Zetian also needs to think in other people’s shoes - why do you say I am a poisonous woman, why do you say I am ruthless, you change Thinking about it, do you think I can stop doing this? In order to protect my husband, protect his power, protect my children, and protect my family, I can do anything. So in her later years, she was so miserable that she couldn&#39;t even sit down and have dinner with four generations like an ordinary woman, and even her own son didn&#39;t dare to come. She felt that she had given so much and received so little. Her emotion was a great irony. I think this is history, allowing us to see a lot of ourselves from them. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“They are all very confident now”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312 , STKaiti;&quot;>;The female characters in the film have difficulties, and the actors themselves are no exception. Hai Qing and Yao Chen have previously expressed the &quot;workplace&quot; anxieties and dilemmas of middle-aged actresses, and Zhou Xun has also begun to play mothers. What do you think of these difficulties they face? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Li Shaohong: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;In fact, this kind of anxiety occurs at every stage of life, whether it is about work, family, or emotions. I think it’s not just married people like us, or people who are mothers, or people like Zhou Xun. For her age group, her experiences of marriage, family, and parents at different times must have existed. The accumulation of these experiences must have played a very sincere role in her portraying the roles of mother and wife. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I think Zhou Xun is becoming more and more mature as she gets older. When we were filming &quot;Orange Is Red&quot;, it was difficult for her to find that kind of feeling when we were filming the fertility scene. It was hard to imagine, so we went through a process at that time and let her go into exile for a few days to slowly find this kind of feeling. Feel. Later, she lamented that the most important thing in performing is to express what you feel. You must first feel it before you can truly understand it and perform it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2005, I also filmed her playing the role of a mother. In &quot;Life and Death&quot;, I felt that she had grasped the character&#39;s pregnancy and childbirth very accurately. Now that she is filming &quot;Her&quot;, the role of mother is no longer a difficult thing for her, so I think she has gone beyond whether she has done it when dealing with the family relationship and the relationship between mother-in-law and daughter-in-law in the film. A simple question like mother, but an insight into two women of different eras and ages. She asked her mother-in-law: &quot;Who are you living for?&quot; In fact, when she asked her mother-in-law, she also asked herself. When a woman is in her own stage, she will reflect and discover the value of her own existence from others, which transforms into the awakening of self-salvation and self-awareness.

&lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;2023年9月30日，在浙江杭州奥体中心网球中心进行的杭州亚运会网球男子单打决赛中，中国选手张之臻以2比0战胜日本选手绵贯阳介，夺得冠军&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（新华社/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;时隔29年后，中国选手再夺亚运网球男单金牌，冠军是26岁的张之臻。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;除了亚运冠军，他ATP（国际职业网球联合会）单打最高世界排名第52位，打进过马德里大师赛8强，法网、美网32强，这都是中国大陆男网的最好成绩。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;上一位夺得亚运网球男单金牌的是潘兵，他在1990年北京亚运会夺冠，并在四年后的广岛亚运会蝉联。 1990年之后，中国女网崛起，逐渐确立了在亚运赛场的统治地位，但中国男网发展较慢。直到上届亚运会，19岁的吴易昺爆冷杀入决赛，最终获得银牌，中国男网才重回亚运决赛。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;张之臻和吴易昺目前的ATP排名都在世界前100，也分别是本届亚运会的一号和三号种子选手。在吴易昺止步8强后，张之臻成为独苗。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/30/MqUATwgWZ1DluNirRdL5ZDvoKXM2pklSecNsA5fj.jpg&quot;

&lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;2023年9月30日，张之臻在比赛中回球&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（新华社/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;前五盘的形势令人意外。从张之臻的表情动作来看，他有些情绪，击球也不够专注。第一局即被破发，4个双发失误。詹俊等多位解说都认为，或许是看台上的干扰太多，张之臻无法迅速进入比赛状态，打得有些随意。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;也确实，现场广播频繁播报：请保持安静，谢谢。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;第一局第六盘，张之臻进入状态，保住发球局，此后连追五局。从1:4扭转为6:4。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;第二局第一盘，张之臻连续4个发球得分，一发成功率100%。第七盘结束，张之臻以4:3领先后，叫了伤病暂停，请护理员按摩了一下腰。随后在绵贯阳介的发球局不多做跑动，放掉一局。 4:4后，张之臻直落4分，保下发球局，以5:4领先。此后双方互保发球局，将比赛拖入抢七。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;抢七大战双方都死死咬住比分，一路拖到7:7。在张之臻的第三个赛点，绵贯阳介击球出界，张之臻拿下第19届亚运会网球男单冠军。他将自己的护腕和球都给扔给观众，身披国旗绕场。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;发球是张之臻最大的优势，他也被认为是中国男网历代选手中身体素质最好的。张之臻身高193cm，在网球选手中算得上大个子。大个子更可能成为发球好手，这点他自己也知道，他曾说“发球应该是我最大的武器，但有时候我发球还是不在线，有时候一发成功率突然就是很小。所以我还是想进阶我的发球技术，减少一发的失误，这对我来说是非常重要的。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/30/b00vwFWYnoAXklNCqnIsIh6W1mzAxUlM64O2SoR5.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;611&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/30/b00vwFWYnoAXklNCqnIsIh6W1mzAxUlM64O2SoR5.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252889&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;2023年9月30日，张之臻（左）与绵贯阳介在赛后握手&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（新华社/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;26岁的张之臻从4岁开始打网球，10岁进入徐汇区队，12岁进入上海队。他的父亲曾是职业网球运动员，母亲则是射击运动员。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;张之臻入选上海队这一年，中国网球界发生了一个巨变：网管中心允许李娜、郑洁、晏紫等4名运动员“单飞”，此举被认为是我国网球职业化之路的“破冰之举”，由此形成了目前中国网球队的双轨制管理模式。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;进入上海队后，张之臻就被送到法国尼斯进行训练。他曾与丹尼尔·梅德韦杰夫结伴在世界各地参加ITF希望赛，还得到过希望赛的男双亚军。九年后，梅德韦杰夫第二次获得澳网亚军，ATP排名升至第一，成为第一个终结“四巨头”对世界第一长达18年垄断的年轻人。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;此时此刻，中国网球公开赛时隔四年后重启。梅德韦杰夫正在北京参加中网，而目前ATP排名最高的亚洲选手、2014年的亚运冠军西岗良仁，也在亚运和中网之间选择了后者。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;张之臻的青少年赛打得不多，最高排名为166位。 2012年，尚不满16岁的张之臻转入职业网坛。此后四年，他的成绩都止步不前。张之臻所在的上海浦东网球队总经理在接受媒体采访时分析，他四年原地踏步，有俱乐部管理层的失误。一来是过早转职业，未承想仍在发育期的他在连续出战成人比赛后，出现了伤病；二来是长期的海外集训，没让家属陪同，“一个孩子在国外是很孤独的，我们没能及时沟通，没能去陪陪他。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;张之臻也认为自己转职业过早，刚刚在希望赛能赢球，就转去了职业。 “其实可以打更多的青少年赛去积累信心，但是一直输，输得那叫一个惨。”张之臻说，“虽然每周都在打比赛，但每周都在输，这种感觉非常不好。你只有比赛赢多一点才会有感觉，状态才能出来。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;他说直到2015年，自己才在亚洲赛季取得了不错的成绩：拿到生涯巡回赛首胜，又生涯首胜TOP100，他才觉得自己真的能打一辈子网球。 “到那会儿才觉得自己有能力去和他们比赛，然后一步步走到现在。” 但就在那年年底，张之臻左脚骨裂，保守治疗两个月后不得不进行手术。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;张之臻是个很懂挫折的选手。面对有关过往输球的提问，他会先笑几声，然后坦率作答。在进入ATP排名前100后——他是首位进入ATP前100的大陆男网选手——他经历了屡战屡败的半年。他坦言那时候已经把心态压得很低，只要能赢一盘就好。但多数时候，他都是一轮游。他想可能是比赛打少了，对赛场的控制力也就弱了。在刚转职业时，他也遭遇过相似的困境。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“那半年状态就是很差，我也不知道怎么了。那半年的状态和现在就是完全不一样，当时的状态就是非常差，怎么打怎么没。”张之臻在2023年夏天回忆说。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/30/2uJidZhmCML30aNGVyGRadlQFyqSOWPELy9h3z9J.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/30/2uJidZhmCML30aNGVyGRadlQFyqSOWPELy9h3z9J.jpg&quot;

&lt;p>;2023年显然是不错的一年。张之臻取得了马德里大师赛8强和法网、美网32强的成绩。许多人问他为什么心态上与之前截然不同，五盘大战多次取胜，他的回答坦诚得颇有意味：“在输掉那么多场比赛后，你的内心其实会变得平静，你反倒不会感觉到紧张啊什么的了。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;他在法网输给ATP排名前10的选手鲁德，又在4个月后的美网淘汰鲁德。美网比赛前，他研究了鲁德的硬地赛和训练视频，也重看了自己与鲁德的比赛，他感到自己是有机会的。 “上次完完全全是冲击他的心态，比较慌张，这次更多感觉是有点机会，可以去抗衡，打得没那么着急。”他知道制胜的关键是专注，“上次的后半段在体能和发力都有顾虑，这次就没有。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/30/uViYg8Gq3wWo3PwlN7Ycovs4MDiLDmiWtWQw0yMN.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;727&quot; height=&quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/30/uViYg8Gq3wWo3PwlN7Ycovs4MDiLDmiWtWQw0yMN.jpg&quot;

&lt;p>;很显然，只要张之臻找回状态，他就会越打越好。一旦开始赢球，就像抢七，“赢个几场，状态就会回来。”张之臻说，“或许就有运气一直赢下去。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;他是比赛型选手，一到比赛就兴奋。在马德里大师赛对弗里茨（世界排名前10）的前夜，他只睡了四个小时，白天又补了两个小时。 “很兴奋，加上有时差，肾上腺激素根本下不来。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;随着杭州亚运夺冠，张之臻已经获得了2024年巴黎奥运会的入场券。他和整个中国男网，正在迎来最好的时代。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在亚运前的一次采访中，当被问到2023年最开心的时刻，张之臻不假思索地回答：“邓紫棋回复了我微博！”他说网球成绩未来可以更好，但喜欢的歌手回复，就只有一次。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2023年5月4日，张之臻以8强的成绩告别马德里大师赛。这是首次有中国大陆男网球员打入大师赛8强。他发了一条微博，写着邓紫棋的歌词：“天空没有极限。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“你的未来无边。 ”邓紫棋回复了下一句。 &lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;起源于英国普通法的竞业限制，很好地解决了这个问题：公司与员工签订合同，员工离职，公司有权限制他们的就业选择，以消除竞争风险。这样的限制是附带条件的，竞业只及于一段时期、特定的区域和行业。最重要的是，需要花钱补偿。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;竞业限制是劳动合同之外的约定，公司要付成本，因此最初并不常见。只有技术秘密是竞争的关键因素时，条款才会启动，并且只面向少数人群。竞业限制看似限制员工择业权，但考虑到是自由合意，员工额外拿钱，因此法律保护这种合同的效力。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;竞业限制是现代职场的常见现象，美国作为最大的普通法国家，按理说会欣然接受。然而美国社会有浓厚的“托拉斯恐惧症”，这种合同被认为限制劳动力流动，有消除企业竞争之嫌，因此不仅民主党主导的蓝州禁止竞业合同，连佛罗里达这种共和党大州，法律也倾向于禁止。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;竞业合同是市场自发的产物，明令将其禁止，无法解决“教会徒弟，饿死师傅”的困境，实际也不利于劳动者自由流动。为了消除员工离职后的竞争威胁，公司会盯防在职员工，设置漫长的脱密期。员工需要签署单独保密协议，这种协议即使离职后仍有效。大公司达成默契，互不“挖角”。这些措施既增加职场不确定性，实际也阻碍了劳动者自由流动。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我们原本没有竞业限制的文化，这项制度从西方传入，受到法律认可，被广泛接受。竞业限制由公司承担成本，因此通常只有公司高管或特定行业才用得到。与美国相反，近些年中国职场的竞业限制不仅没有式微，反而有增多的势头。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在新兴的互联网、电动汽车行业，员工被禁止再入职的企业，可达数百家之多，包括同行企业、上下游供应和销售商。起先只有高管或骨干人才竞业，现在成为员工入职标配，“无人不竞业、无处不竞业”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;现实中对于无关紧要的人员流动，竞业限制只是恫吓，公司不会真的出手阻止。至于公司重视的员工跳槽，它们视情况启动。有的直接给钱，有的观望拖延，随时给离职员工致命一击。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;职场论坛上经常看到这类话题：从公司离职，公司没有谈到竞业补偿，还可以入职竞争企业吗？有人给出肯定性意见，既然没有竞业补偿，协议不生效，就不存在竞业吧。这时往往有亲历者给出血泪忠告：不要轻易踩线，因为公司有发动突然袭击的可能性。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;《中华人民共和国劳动合同法》第二十三条规定，“用人单位可以在劳动合同或者保密协议中与劳动者约定竞业限制条款，并约定在解除或者终止劳动合同后，在竞业限制期限内按月给予劳动者经济补偿”。所谓“可以约定”，一方面出于意思自治，同时给竞业纠纷埋下伏笔。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;竞业限制时长，补偿的金额，劳动合同法都未规定，而是通过司法解释明确——合同不明的情况下，最长不得超过两年，平均到每月金额不低于原工资的三分之一。员工违约金额，没有相关规定，属于“约定”范畴。员工拟定竞业协议时，倾向于拔高违约赔偿金，月薪一两万元的岗位，违约赔偿往往高达几十上百万，一个让员工望而生畏的数字。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;公司应何时支付补偿金呢？司法解释称：用人单位三个月未支付竞业补偿，劳动者请求解除竞业限制约定的，人民法院应予支持。看似有效期只有三个月，实则不然。公司三个月未支付，竞业限制实际上仍然有效——失效的要件是劳动者请诉解除，法院判决认定。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;现实情况通常是，一旦公司收到诉求（通过告知、劳动仲裁或起诉），前员工想解除竞业限制，公司从容应对。员工不构成竞争威胁，公司最多补偿三个月的30%工资，解除竞业限制；员工有意或入职竞争公司，直接向对方账号汇出一笔钱，发起阻止或索赔。司法实践显示，这时法院倾向于认为，公司有在履行竞业补偿，竞业限制被激活了。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当代竞业限制，员工离职后偃旗息鼓、不入同行，公司不了了之。一旦员工认为协议未生效，入职构成违约，公司可以发动袭击。只需支付一笔小钱，协议启动，员工卷入“竞业陷阱”。不仅新工作不保，还要赔付一大笔违约金。要怎么操作，公司握有完全主动权。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这种低成本、高回报的竞业限制，显然是利于公司的。这正是竞业限制增多的根本原因。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;解决方法很简单，对竞业限制的双方利益重新衡平。员工的违约金额，应当划出一个上限。竞业限制范围，也应清晰化——仅限于少数竞争对手，而不是漫天张网。竞业协议的启动，补偿金的支付，也需要明确。无论公司还是员工，都要对双方关系划出清晰的边界。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;劳资关系中，法律需要消除不确定性，减少冲突。中国职场的竞业增多，是在给企业制造特权，阻碍劳动力自由流动。竞业限制带来的职场陷阱，法律应当将其填平。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;
