For this city that was once famous for Zhuge Wolong, if the case cannot be solved as soon as possible, not only may the next Midi Music Festival be ruined, but it will also affect the reputation of the entire city. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 3, the keywords &quot;Midi steals things&quot; quickly became hot topics on social media. According to information released by netizens at the scene, the music festival had ended the day before, and many music fans who participated in the music festival had not yet evacuated. However, a large number of nearby villagers went into the campground to search for things. According to Solitaire’s stolen property statistics, some people’s clothing and shoes were stolen, some wine and tea were stolen, some camping equipment such as tents, sleeping bags, and moisture-proof mats were lost, and high-value electronic and digital products such as computers, mobile phones, cameras, and recording equipment were stolen. Some &quot;thiefs&quot; only took away the tent, leaving other materials neatly in place. Even the fist-thick cables on the stage were stolen. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to self-reported information by the thieves, the total value of the stolen materials may reach hundreds of thousands of yuan. A video circulating on the Internet shows a middle-aged woman who was caught taking something out of her bag while defending herself: &quot;We just went to get it when no one was there,&quot; as if the owner of the tent had temporarily left ( Maybe you go out to eat or even just use the toilet), the things in the tent become ownerless and can be taken as you please. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As the first original music festival in China, the Midi Music Festival with a history of more than 20 years has become one of the most famous carnivals in the Chinese music industry, especially rock music. For the venue where the music festival is held, tens of thousands of enthusiastic music fans from all over the country will not only bring direct income to the local area, but also become an excellent opportunity to promote the local area. Therefore, many cities, especially third- and fourth-tier cities, are competing to hold or invite large-scale music festivals to be held locally. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This Midi Music Festival was held in Nanyang and also received great attention from the local area. According to the official social media account &quot;Nanyang Release&quot; of the Nanyang Municipal Government Information Office, on September 29, the opening day of the Central Plains Midi Music Festival, the Secretary of the Nanyang Municipal Party Committee and the Mayor, wearing red volunteer uniforms, personally greeted the guests at the exit of Nanyang Railway Station. Music fans all over the country. Half a month ago, Nanyang City held a preparatory meeting for the Midi Music Festival. The Secretary of the Municipal Party Committee personally made arrangements and required the establishment of a high-standard headquarters at the municipal level to carefully carry out various guarantee work for the music festival. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A few days before the opening of the music festival, the Nanyang Municipal Government Information Office also released a city image promotional video and a local &quot;food, drink, and fun picture&quot; through its official account to promote local tourism resources. Such high-standard preparation and reception highlight the importance attached to the music festival. It was with this kind of attention that the music festival itself seemed to go without any problems. However, what was unexpected was that large-scale thefts occurred after the festival. It can be said that the previous efforts were ruined. This makes the previous official statement of “protecting the personal and property safety of tourists” a joke. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to theft, netizens who attended the music festival accused some people of harassing tourists in the name of toasting during dinner in the hotel, and even beating tourists while drunk. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This information spreads rapidly through social networks. If the local area fails to take prompt measures to identify problems such as theft and harassment, it will greatly damage the image of the local area. In addition to the stolen music fans who said that if there is no result in handling this incident, they will never visit Nanyang again. Some netizens also said that they felt very unsafe after watching the video of the villagers taking things away, and they will definitely do so when traveling in the future. Avoid this place. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the descriptions of the thieves and live music fans, most of the thieves were local villagers, who even used tricycles to pull the items. This scene can&#39;t help but remind people of the situations that have happened in many places before where villagers stole the crops of foreign agricultural entrepreneurs. It was reported in the summer of 2019 that a sweet potato farmer in Henan contracted 200 acres of land to grow watermelons. When the watermelons matured, nearby villagers gathered in groups to steal the melons. A melon-picking incident also occurred in Jiaxing, Zhejiang, where almost all the watermelons from more than 20 greenhouses were stolen. Some melon thieves were even caught by melon farmers and fell to the ground and were &quot;injured&quot; during the pulling process. Instead, the melon farmers were asked to pay compensation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In these theft incidents, some places often use various excuses to excuse local farmers. For example, it is not &quot;theft&quot;, but they believe the rumor that &quot;the owner doesn&#39;t want it anymore&quot;, or there are people in the local area who are not the owners. The tradition of “picking up the leaks” after harvesting, etc. In the Midi Music Festival theft incident, some participants alleged that after catching the thief and calling the police, the police let the villagers go because &quot;there was no evidence to prove the theft.&quot; If the property of participants cannot be protected for a large-scale event that the government attaches so much importance to, who will dare to come here in the future? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is true that the quality of villagers in some places is not high, they are greedy for petty gains, and their legal awareness is weak. They have the idea that the law does not punish the public, and they feel that taking some things from &quot;outsiders&quot; will not do anything. If local officials do not take severe measures to punish these thieving villagers and cannot effectively protect the interests of foreign tourists or investors, and their reputation is ruined, no one will dare to travel or invest here again. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the announcement from the Midi Music Festival Organizing Committee, the local police have set up a task force to investigate the theft cases. Some fans also reported that some of the stolen items had been recovered. This time Nanyang must make every effort to solve the case, recover the stolen goods, reduce the losses of music fans, and at the same time severely punish the thieves without mercy. Only in this way can it be possible to restore the reputation, restore the music festival, restore the music fans, and restore the tourists from all over the country. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 04 Oct 2023 15:55:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[颜歌：英语世界里的少数族裔]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257450]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-04 15:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/20/ERThthpwjc4pFBkH71171Fy2GAIFQY7zJqMvpifj.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;1440&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/ERThthpwjc4pFBkH71171Fy2GAIFQY7z JqMvpifj. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251382&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;(Feng Xiaoping/Picture)&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>; &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One day in the summer of 2017, Yan Ge was vaccinating her one-month-old son at a clinic in Dublin when she suddenly received an email from Irish writer Lucy Caldwell. She was invited to contribute to Faber&#39;s short story collection Being Various: New Irish Short Stories ( &quot;Short Story Collection&quot;&lt;/span>;) Write a novel. Lucy is the editor of this collection. She had read two of Yan Gefa&#39;s stories in the &quot;Irish Times&quot; and found them interesting, so she came here. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yan Ge still remembers her shock at that time: first of all, she was an outsider, no one in the Irish literary world knew her, she had only published two novels in newspapers; secondly, she was the only one in Ireland. How did you become an Irish writer after living for a few years? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In that email that made Yan Ge feel unreal, Lucy greatly broadened the concept of Irish writers - this concept should include writers who were born in Ireland but grew up elsewhere, and writers who were chosen from elsewhere. Writers who call Ireland home include those who somehow find themselves living in Ireland. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What happened next unfolded smoothly. Yan Ge wrote a story that took place in Dublin, &quot;How I Fell in Love with the Well-Documented Life of Alex Whelan&quot;, which was well received and included in this new collection of Irish short stories. The first article (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Published in 2019&lt;/span>;). Later, Angus, the editor of &quot;Different: A Collection of New Irish Short Stories&quot; and director of Faber Publishing, learned that Yan Ge was writing a collection of short stories and approached his agent, Matt, hoping to She gave Faber exclusive preview rights. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/fNclzsO4zmmZmaYmqR2Fj9t55L8glzuUoiCpIvtK.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;1279&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/fNclzsO4zmmZmaYmqR2Fj9t55L8glzuUoiCpIvtK.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251380&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Yan Ge visited Wangcong Temple in his hometown of Pi County when he was a child&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(provided by interviewee/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Faber is a purely literary publishing organization founded in 1921. It has published the works of 13 Nobel Prize writers and 6 Booker Prize writers. There will be no sky-high royalties, and packaging and promotion will not cost as much as cutting-edge companies. If it is not given to Faber, the agent will submit the work to various publishing houses. If multiple publishing houses compete for the manuscript, it will be auctioned. As a result, the manuscript may be sold at a relatively high price. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But Matt believes that Faber is suitable for Yan Ge’s work. It is of stable quality, responsible, and can be cooperated for a long time. Moreover, the editors of this book are Kazuo Ishiguro and Sebastian. Barry&#39;s managing editor. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Finally Faber was given exclusive preview rights. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The exclusive preview period generally does not exceed 10 days. Faber responded quickly. He sent the message on Friday and gave the quotation on Wednesday. After the two parties negotiated, it was determined on Thursday that he would buy the rights to two books, including the completed &quot;Elsewhere&quot; and another book scheduled to be delivered in 2024. The novel &quot;Hotel Destination&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;This means that the next five years are almost bought out.&quot; Yan Ge is worried that the second book is due to be delivered in April 2024 according to the contract, and because of the Chinese novel &quot;Pingle County Chronicles&quot; All work is behind schedule. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The veteran American literary publisher Scribner will also acquire the copyright for Yan Ge’s collection of short stories and the 2024 novel. Scribner published works by Hemingway and Fitzgerald. It was later acquired by Simon &amp; Schuster and became the company&#39;s flagship publishing house. It also published books by pure literary writers such as Annie Proulx. , and also publishes works by Stephen King, the master of horror novels. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/JN1pQDJEs7PrVeKtiyHqlhyTdiV0MdHfQob3MpvM.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1440&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/JN1pQDJEs7PrVeKtiyHqlhyTdiV0MdHfQob3MpvM.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251374&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color ) &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The signing process with Scribner went smoothly beyond Yan Ge&#39;s expectations. The editor-in-chief and two young editors chatted with Yan Ge over video for an afternoon about the work, and in the evening they settled on North American rights with their agent. Next, the Italian copyright was also negotiated. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yan Ge felt a bit like selling futures at the time: &quot;The unfinished novel was sold directly like this. This was the first time in my writing career of more than 20 years. Yes. It may not be a big deal for an English writer, but it is unimaginable for a writer whose mother tongue is Chinese and writes in English.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the summer of 2023, &quot;Elsewhere&quot; will be published in the UK and the United States. , winning praise from media outlets including The Irish Times, The Guardian, The New York Times and The New Yorker. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the summer of 2023, Yan Ge took her son and husband back to Chengdu after three years of COVID-19. To be precise, back to Pidu District (&lt;span style=&quot;font- family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Originally known as Pixian County&lt;/span>;) - her hometown - the birthplace of her story of Pingle Town. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/Xis0q8rlqbXScWzR65rY41RJobjmCII9eySPGN9Y.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;1611&quot; data-src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/Xis0q8rlqbXScWzR65rY41RJobjmCII9eySPGN9Y.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251376&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot; We are here to oppose English”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;I will interview you in the summer of 2018 At that time, you were embarking on a creative writing project in the UK, published two novels in the &quot;Irish Times&quot;, and had just completed one of Faber&#39;s &quot;New Irish Novels&quot;. It was a year later that you got an agent. matter. What impressed me most is that you metaphorically joined the &quot;Special Olympics&quot; in the English literary world. Five years later, you have become an English writer signed with a first-class international literary publishing house. Do you still feel like a Paralympian? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Yan Ge: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I don’t feel that way anymore. English writing is a new career for me now, and I face many problems, but they are not so-called language problems, or language is the most superficial problem, and it may not even be considered a problem compared with other problems. English writing is a kind of artistic self-exploration for me. If I were an artist, my medium would be words. Now I am using a new way, new tools, new materials and media to make works. This new medium will bring a new change to my works. This is the most important thing. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Remember the last interview, you were right I said there is nothing terrible about writing in English. The tone is exactly the same as now. Is there any substantial difference between the two? For example, five years ago you were more free to enjoy the freedom of expression that the new language brought to you. Now , after strict writing training in the English literary tradition, have you found some kind of certainty in your writing? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/eHU1AudW5hab48AceoNgsAEGGT6WpLwPg9ssMeN6.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;1606&quot; data-src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/eHU1AudW5hab48AceoNgsAEGGT6WpLwPg9ssMeN6.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251379&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Yan Ge:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Definitely. During the process of studying and living in the UK, I read more and more things in depth, which must be related. I think these are also based on my culture. After all, I am a Chinese writer, so my literary system and narrative system are Chinese. Although I now understand more or less how the other system works, I feel that Chinese is still my language. The root of this is that, ultimately, the way of thinking about Chinese and Chinese literature is an anti-dualistic way. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the English-speaking world, the writing of minority writers like us is a kind of post-colonial cultural expression that must subvert the so-called orthodox English. This is why English as a This is a fate that postcolonial language must face. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Irish writers are probably the first group of writers in the world to write in this post-colonial way, and they are also anti-English. After the British occupied Ireland, Irish became an illegal language. If you spoke Irish, you would be fined and arrested. My husband is Irish. As an intellectual and journalist, he always tells me that you can write in English however you want. We are here to oppose this language anyway. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So when I returned to Ireland, I felt like I was returning to my second natal home. Dublin was the last stop for the promotion of my new English book. As a result, all the tickets for the sharing session were sold out, the venue was full, and there were people sitting on the windowsill. , I was very moved. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/avrzkseviR85yr9K8a9wqJRvjyUOm3eLrZSKA2Ll.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;1673&quot; data-src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/avrzkseviR85yr9K8a9wqJRvjyUOm3eLrZSKA2Ll.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251372&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt; strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;In that environment, no one will care about your language. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Yan Ge: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Yes, no one will think about this problem. It may have something to do with Irish culture. Everyone thinks this is a natural thing. The two stories I submitted to The Irish Times were published directly by the editor, which made me feel like I had landed in front of English readers. Originally, I was waiting for the editor to give me a lot of revision comments. Gradually, I learned that newspapers here have this tradition and are not very good at changing the author&#39;s manuscripts. Only magazines and books have an editorial process. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/s6ywYWgeztUMcCVqMgdxXBeSyPXZlFhN0QU0bxL5.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;1674&quot; data-src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/s6ywYWgeztUMcCVqMgdxXBeSyPXZlFhN0QU0bxL5.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251373&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;In the English writing circle, everyone reads and comments on each other&#39;s manuscripts&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti; &quot;>;When you first write in English, do you show it to your husband first? I remember when I interviewed Ha Jin in 2001, he said that when he first wrote a novel, he would check whether the words were authentic to his son who was born in the United States. At that time, he had just won the National Book Award in the United States. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Yan Ge: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Some of them will be read to him. My husband is my first reader. When I write Chinese, I will also translate it orally to him. share. But if it involves a subject with a Chinese cultural background, it will not be shown to him, but to people who do not understand Chinese culture at all. For example, there is an article &quot;Hai&quot; (Hai) in &quot;Elsewhere&quot;, which is about Confucius and his disciples. It also alludes to the British political system. People without a Chinese cultural background will see a completely different connotation. I asked a historical novelist to read the manuscript, which was more than 20,000 words. She read it carefully and wrote a lot of feedback. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the English writing circle, one thing that I like very much is that everyone reads each other&#39;s manuscripts, devotes a lot of time and energy to each other&#39;s works, and also gives sharp opinions. . My agent was also one of my early readers. This atmosphere is particularly healthy. These people I trust allow me to be bolder and try more things and experiment with more languages ​​without looking forward or backward. It’s like I’m doing acrobatics in this language. Even if I fall down, there are still people. then. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Chinese writers don’t do this. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Yan Ge: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Chinese literature talks about genius. I prefer the workshop tradition among British and American literary creative groups. Discussions and discussions give me the feeling of being in a community. A girlfriend of mine sent me a manuscript that she had revised 36 times and asked me to make further comments. Chinese writers would avoid doing this because it would cast doubt on their own genius. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;My soon-to-be-published Chinese novel &quot;Pingle County Chronicles&quot; is the product of many years of work behind closed doors. When I first finished it, I was very scared and didn&#39;t know how to write it. I sent it to &quot;Harvest&quot; When editing, I especially hope she can give me feedback. For example, for many ancient poems in the book, I asked the editor to find professionals to help review them. If no one comments, I&#39;m like running around naked, which is terrible. I am probably used to the way Western creative writing groups operate, and I am afraid that others will not give me advice. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/zsh2qmh3keyX0vJMj2Y08Uu0P6vmIJHDLtiRydRp.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;1671&quot; data-src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/zsh2qmh3keyX0vJMj2Y08Uu0P6vmIJHDLtiRydRp.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251377&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot; The editor wanted me to delete the redundant convoluted parts.&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 凯体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;When writing in English, have you ever imagined what your readers are like? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Yan Ge: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;When I write in Chinese, I can imagine my readers. I am not necessarily writing for them, but there is probably an implicit reference to the readers. concept. But when writing in English, I feel a sense of panic all the time - I can&#39;t imagine what the reader looks like. He is definitely not white, but I don&#39;t know who he is - he has no face and no identity. I wasn&#39;t a first or second generation immigrant either, just someone stuck there temporarily, and imaginary readers became one of my biggest problems. Then there is the feeling of doing an academic experiment. According to my own interests, if I get to this point today, I will write this, and if I get to that point tomorrow, I will write that. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;These are also the novels in &quot;Elsewhere&quot; What’s the reason for the different themes and very different writing techniques? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Yan Ge: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Yes. When I write in Chinese, I am very rooted - very grounded, so that I can absorb nutrients and feel at ease, but at the same time, it is also tied and fixed. English writing is rootless, very unstable, yet full of vitality and possibility. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Now is your first English short story Now that the collection has been published, do you know who your readers are? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Yan Ge:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I met various ethnic minority writers at reading events and book signings in the UK. They felt that my works It inspired them - they told me that someone like me wrote such a book in such a way, which moved them very much. There are people like this everywhere I go. They are very young, and many of them are ethnic minority authors who are studying creative writing. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I am very happy, I found that I am writing for these people. We minority writers interact with each other and open up a new English writing space. I just give this The space adds some more possibilities. For example, the most superficial expression is that you can add Chinese to English novels. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is easy to fall into the trap of dualism when discussing &quot;readers&quot;. Generally speaking, the English readers that come to mind must be the mainstream society dominated by white people. I think this idea is quite original and very 80s. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Basically from your agent to your book editor Being white and male represents a certain center of power. Does your work being published by well-known established publishing houses in the UK and the United States mean that you are moving closer to a certain center? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Yan Ge: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;As an ethnic minority writer, the English I write must be essentially against English (Against English). It’s not that I want to join the so-called English literature, but literature that is completed using English as the language (Literatures in English). My agent and editors are very supportive of my starting point. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the current context, if you think that people like me must knock on the door and enter a certain center, then it is essentially worship and submission to the Anglo-center. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;If you are not writing for white readers or do not want to enter the mainstream, In addition to challenging traditional English reading habits from a textual perspective—for example, by including some ancient Chinese poems or even Chinese characters—do you express your stance from other perspectives? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Yan Ge: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I will not exclude a certain group, nor will I particularly try to please a certain group. For example, there are local white people in my collection of novels, but there are also Chinese things, including Chinese characters, as well as the non-linear time structure of traditional Chinese literature, and even anti-simplification.

I read Li Yiyun&#39;s first short story collection more than ten years ago when I first went abroad. At that time, I couldn&#39;t see how good it was. That book was actually not written for Chinese readers like me. Now her works have long gone out of the box at that time, becoming more and more open and better. To a certain extent, it is precisely because the kind of &quot;Chinese stories&quot; that the white mainstream society needed have been written before. Now she and many of us can get out of this stereotype and write stories related to China or It has nothing to do with it.

&lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Wang Di at Heming Tea House in Chengdu People&#39;s Park&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa ;&quot;>;(Hua Xiaofeng/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Public Space&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Historian Wang Di&#39;s &quot;Teahouse: The Decline and Renaissance of Chengdu&#39;s Public Life 1950-2000&quot; is in Chengdu Xing Bookstore held a new book sharing session. The founder of the bookstore, Zhang Feng, set up a traditional tea seat in front of the stage at the entrance of the bookstore: a table, three bamboo chairs, three bowls of tea, and a thermos. Zhang Feng, as the host, sits on the right. Sitting on the left is artist Wang Hai, who was Wang Di’s classmate at Chengdu No. 3 Middle School. Wang Di sat in the middle. When he didn&#39;t need to talk, he poured water for the two people around him from time to time. This made Zhang Feng feel embarrassed. Wang Di said: I am Dr. Tea. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The night after the event, Wang Di and I chatted until more than 10 o&#39;clock under the street lamp of Youxing Bookstore. Wang Di realized that it was very late and asked Zhang Feng who was waiting aside: &quot;When will the bookstore be open?&quot; Zhang Feng said: &quot;It can stay open as long as we like.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A few months Previously, before the COVID-19 epidemic was over, Zhang Feng and Lingzi, who was studying for a doctorate in anthropology at Cambridge University, hosted a sharing session by Wang Di at the Dunba Bar in the suburbs of Chengdu. There was no theme and they could talk about whatever they wanted. Wang Di spoke from 7:30 pm to 12:00 midnight. Lingzi paused the chat to let the more than 100 listeners sitting around take a break. Wang Di thought he was done. But Reiko told him that it was just halftime. Wang Di was going to fly to Macau the next morning. I thought he would say, it’s too late today, so let’s just stop here. Unexpectedly, he said, today I will lay down my life to accompany you. The activity lasted until about 1 o&#39;clock in the morning. This is an amazing and vibrant atmosphere in Chengdu’s public space, and those who participate in it will lose track of time. This is the Decameron, but it is much more than the Decameron. I met Brother Feng in both Youxing Bookstore and Dunba. He seemed to be constantly posting about various activities in Chengdu’s public spaces. I admired his energy and he said it was nothing, it was very simple and it didn&#39;t take any time. I also met lawyer Zhang Ying again. She came to participate in Wang Di&#39;s sharing session. The &quot;Bright Dialogue&quot; she hosted is still running. She hopes that people can learn the awareness of thinking instead of just speaking. Skill. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Now that Wang Di is back in Chengdu, he has been invited to many activities, almost all of which he talked about from morning till night. He was very patient with all kinds of questions, even though he had answered many similar questions many times. He has appeared in various media. He enjoys speaking to the public about his historical research and writing. His name is connected with &quot;street culture&quot;, &quot;pao brother&quot; and &quot;teahouse&quot; in the main fields of his research. He is concerned about the relationship between people and space, communicating specific words and objects. He thinks about the significance of history to the present and is willing to spread his thoughts to a wider scope. He became one of the most popular historians. At the sharing meeting, Zhang Feng talked about the rising &quot;public history&quot; and called Wang Di &quot;the historian in the teahouse.&quot; The background of their conversation was transparent. I could see behind the background board. Old aunties were sitting comfortably on bamboo chairs chatting. A courier guy wearing a helmet was walking with takeaways. People on motorcycles were walking by. Pass. This is a natural superposition of the lives of Chengdu citizens, forming a richly layered visual landscape. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Teahouse: The Decline and Revival of Public Life in Chengdu, 1950-2000&quot; can be referred to as &quot;Teahouse (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 毷体, 毷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Part 2&lt;/span >;)》. In &quot;Teahouse (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Part 1&lt;/span>;), also known as &quot;Teahouse: Public Life and Microcosm of Chengdu 1900-1950&quot;, Wang Di I have compared teahouses in Sichuan and other places, such as teahouses in Guangdong. &quot;Guangdong is generally called a teahouse. On the surface it looks like a teahouse in Sichuan, but it obviously serves the middle class and is different from the &#39;popular&#39; teahouses in Sichuan.&quot; When describing Guangdong teahouses, Wang Di used the word &quot;grand&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Macau, in order to intuitively compare with Sichuan teahouses, Wang Di took us to a Cantonese-style teahouse in the Grand Lisboa for morning tea. This teahouse is more like a fine restaurant, with far more dishes on the table than tea sets. The waiter brought us barbecued pork cakes and carrot cakes from a cart. There are already roast goose, shrimp dumplings, soup dumplings, siomai, beef brisket and fish soup on the table. This sumptuous morning tea costs more than a thousand patacas. The surrounding design is also very thoughtful. The wall decoration is designed with a steamer-like texture, giving people a feeling of steaming steam. Wang Di had been in such steaming heat. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The turning point&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;That day happened to be the time for the college entrance examination in the mainland, and schools in Macau began to have holidays. High school students in Macau do not need to take the college entrance examination. They all apply to go to university. Wang Di feels that children in the mainland are too involved now. &quot;We like the imperial view of history, but we actually advocate being a superior person. We look down on ordinary people, so we hope that our children will not be ordinary people. Let every ordinary person live with dignity. This is what we should advocate. This is what I The reasons for emphasizing the civilian view of history.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/mW0sgmuN7YkrFjGnaL409XWSgtaZHI3NHYzg1FwI.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0 &quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/mW0sgmuN7YkrFjGnaL409XWSgtaZHI3NHYzg1FwI.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252387&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On September 17, 2023, Wang Di shared the new book at Xing Bookstore in Chengdu &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>; (Southern People Weekly reporter Wei Yi/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Di thought of his past. When the college entrance examination was resumed in 1977, Wang Di happened to be on a business trip in Shanghai. He has returned to Chengdu to work for two years. Before that, he worked in the countryside in Meishan, Su Dongpo&#39;s hometown. His elder brother had already gone to the Yunnan Production and Construction Corps. He could not have gone to the countryside, but if he didn&#39;t go to the countryside, there would be no future and no job arrangement. &quot;I still want to go to the countryside. If I go to the countryside, I may have the opportunity to be recommended to go to university.&quot; Wang Di volunteered to go to the countryside and performed very well, but still did not get the chance to be recommended to go to university. In 1975, through recruitment, he returned to Chengdu and joined the Brick and Tile Factory of the Machinery Branch of the Chengdu Railway Bureau. &quot;Burning bricks and tiles is absolutely hard physical labor.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;I am in the brick kiln class. The brick kiln is oval, and the fire is eternal. Along the edge of the fire, there are many kiln fire cycles. After entering, it is like a tunnel. You transport bricks out of the kiln. In this weather, dog days, when you go in, the fire is It was hot. I only wore shorts and a mask when I went in. I was covered in sweat. Only my two eyes were exposed. The kiln dust was very heavy. Several people piled bricks up, the rhythm was as fast as doing exercise. At that time, the food stamps were rationed. Ordinary residents were given 26 kilograms per month. Because we were doing heavy manual labor, the food stamps were 46 kilograms. When you see this comparison, you know how heavy this labor is. Generally, factories work on an 8-hour working day, but we work on a 4-hour working day because we can&#39;t be too tired. This is a place no one wants to go. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After working in the brick factory for more than a year, Wang Di was transferred to the labor union because he could draw. He painted many paintings and painted many slogans. He wanted to be a painter but had no chance. He failed to become a painter, but this amateur skill still gave him the opportunity to escape from heavy manual labor. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The changing times gave him the opportunity to go to college. When China and the United States established diplomatic relations, he truly felt that times had changed. Wang Di, who had just entered college, wrote the following words in his diary on December 16, 1978: &quot;What an outstanding initiative and a great step. China and the United States have officially established diplomatic relations. The grievances accumulated over the years will be It was quickly eliminated. In the morning, we were in the political and economics class in the first teaching building. When we heard this important news, everyone flushed with excitement. When we heard that Vice Chairman Deng would visit the United States in January next year, we all clapped. This fully illustrates the will of the people.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/Xspu7YCSZb2PIyHt7ntjioMvMMeTtwV4asBjCpVg.jpg&quot; border=&quot; 0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;455&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/Xspu7YCSZb2PIyHt7ntjioMvMMeTtwV4asBjCpVg.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252388&quot;>;&lt; /p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Wang Di’s graduation photo from the History Department of Sichuan University&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(provided by interviewee/picture )&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although many years have passed, the scene of that day is still imprinted in Wang Di&#39;s mind. More than two hundred people from the 77th and 78th classes of the History Department took political economics classes in the largest classroom in the first teaching building. Because it is a large class, the classroom has radio and amplification equipment. During the break, one of the students turned on the radio. Through the loudspeaker, everyone heard the news about the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and the United States being broadcast by the Central People&#39;s Broadcasting Station. The noisy classroom fell silent, and then everyone applauded. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The teaching building of the University of Macau is very quiet. An art exhibition by University of Macau faculty members is being held in the library. Three of Wang Di&#39;s paintings participated in the exhibition, but he was busy with work and had not seen them yet. He took us around the library several times before we found the exhibition hall. His paintings are placed in the most conspicuous position in the exhibition hall. The three portraits are of Fairbank, James Scott and Carlo Ginzburg, three scholars he admired. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When writing a preface to Barbara Tuchman&#39;s book Stilwell, Fairbank said: &quot;For a long time, the United States has tried to make China more like itself - this is a waste of time. Quixotic efforts, but failed many times, and now this kind of effort is rising again... &#39;In the end, China went its own way, as if Americans had never been there.&#39;&quot; Wang Di feels Fairbank&#39;s lifelong efforts were to strengthen the understanding and friendship between the people of China and the United States. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When Wang Di was teaching undergraduates at Texas A&amp;amp;M University, he collected American media reports on the May Fourth Movement so that students could write papers based on these original materials. These sources, to his surprise, were largely unused by historians. &quot;The American media mainly reports on major events in China, and also includes some introductions and analyzes of Chinese society and culture, as well as China&#39;s economy and education. The personal records I used and the media interviews with individuals are from their The China you see with your own eyes has details, stories, and feelings, which to a large extent make up for the lack of personal destiny and experience behind major events.&quot; Wang Di has always emphasized individuals and details. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Macao is one of the important birthplaces of the Revolution of 1911. Sun Yat-sen practiced medicine here, and there is a statue of Sun Yat-sen in front of Jinghu Hospital. Wang Di recommended me to visit Morrison&#39;s tomb. &quot;It&#39;s near the White Pigeon Nest, and it has a sense of history.&quot; When Wang Di&#39;s historian friends Yang Nianqun and Sun Jiang came to Macau, he took them there. Morrison edited and published the first English-Chinese dictionary, the Chinese-English Dictionary, was the first to translate the Bible into Chinese, and opened the first clinic integrating Chinese and Western medicine in Macau. He is a pioneering figure in Sino-Western exchanges, and Macao has historically been a bridgehead for Sino-Western exchanges. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the residence of the University of Macau, a waterway passes through the sea under the balcony. On one side of the sea is Macau and on the other side is Zhuhai. Seeing the coast reminds Wang Di of his fishing days in the United States. He has two major hobbies: fishing and growing vegetables. He planted many things on the balcony - Tianqi, cucumbers, fungus... and put aside his hobby of fishing. &quot;It&#39;s not always good for a professor to fish on the coast next to the university.&quot; &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 毷体, 毷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(laughing)&lt;/span>; On his balcony, he I never saw anyone fishing on the tidal flats. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Di has taught at universities in mainland China and the United States. Now that he has come to Macau, he feels that he has gained another perspective on thinking about history. Being at the junction of China and the West is helpful to his research. During the three years of the epidemic, many academic conferences have been suspended. After having this meal with us in Macau, Wang Di is going to Hong Kong to attend a meeting of Chinese and foreign historians. The conference does not require everyone to write a paper, but just talks about some recent ideas. Wang Di plans to take a bus to Hong Kong and take the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Reading&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In Macau, Wang Di rarely went to teahouses. He likes roadside stalls. He introduced us to a shop near White Pigeon Nest to eat curry beef soup. &quot;The shop is right on the street, and diners eat on the street. It&#39;s delicious. I eat it every time I pass by.&quot; Children who come from such a shop facing the street, in the words of Wang Di&#39;s classmate Wang Hai, are &quot;street eaters.&quot; Baby&quot;. Wang Hai said that he is a &quot;street kid&quot;. Unlike Wang Di who grew up in a compound, &quot;street kid&quot; needs stronger ability to get around. Wang Hai feels that artists can get away with it, but historians cannot. This is the difference between the two. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A few years ago, Wang Di had a conversation with Liushahe, which made him feel nervous. When he was a child, he and Liushahe lived in the courtyard of the Sichuan Federation of Literary and Art Circles, and he and his brother would go to Liushahe to listen to stories. Also living in this courtyard are Sha Ting, Ai Wu and others. Wang Di&#39;s historical writing has literary and aesthetic self-requirements, which is probably related to the influence of the humanistic environment he grew up in. But those were not peaceful days. When he wanted to study, he had to sneak into the library of the Federation of Literary and Art Circles Library. It was an era when reading was like a thief. Wang Di only attended elementary school for three years, and did not complete middle school or high school. In high school, due to political review, he almost lost the opportunity to enter a higher education. But his habit of reading helped him. When the college entrance examination suddenly resumed, he was not so unprepared. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When the college entrance examination was resumed in 1977, Wang Di was 21 years old and working in the railway bureau trade union. Train tickets are free and you can walk everywhere. The union provides good benefits and will be allocated some scarce goods. His parents felt that the job at the Railway Bureau was an iron rice bowl. Even if he went to college, the job assigned after graduation would not necessarily be better than it is now. They suggested that he wait for another two years. After working for five years, he could study with pay, and he could return to school after graduation. original unit. After listening to his parents&#39; advice, Wang Di did not take the college entrance examination in 1977. On the day of the college entrance examination, he happened to be on a business trip to Shanghai. Although he was a worker at that time, he &quot;worked for work&quot;, that is, doing cadre work as a worker, which seemed quite comfortable. In Shanghai, he happened to see candidates entering the college entrance examination examination room. Such a scene is a stimulus to him. He felt very lost, &quot;a feeling of being abandoned by the times.&quot; At that moment, he decided that he must take the exam next year, &quot;I can&#39;t wait any longer.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He prepared secretly and did not dare to tell his parents. &quot;What if I give up again if they try to persuade me?&quot; At that time, he lived in a work unit and went home once a week. He didn&#39;t mention it when he got back, and only told his parents after the exam. The parents are still very happy. My grades were pretty good, and I did particularly well on the history test. I originally wanted to study Chinese, but actually I still wanted to draw. I felt that studying Chinese and art had something to do with it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When I first met Wang Di at Chengdu Heming Tea House, he had just attended the 40th anniversary party of his college classmates the night before. Students still remember that Wang Di was the first student admitted to the History Department of Sichuan University in 1978. He scored 96 out of 100 points in history. When he went to report, it was No. 1. &quot;Actually, I didn&#39;t know what historical research was at that time. I just liked reading some history books.&quot; The composition of my college classmates was very complicated. When I first entered school, the youngest student in the class was 16 years old and the oldest was 32 years old. &quot;Now I can&#39;t tell my age, almost all of them are retired. There are groups of students who specialize in traveling, groups that specialize in drinking, and groups that specialize in playing mahjong.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among college classmates like Wang Di are still there There are very few people working. Wang Di is a chair professor at the University of Macau and can retire at the age of 70. For the 40th anniversary party, the students planned to go to Anren Town for two days. Wang Di has something to do and has to return to Macau. The classmates in Chengdu decided to get together in Chengdu one day in advance in order to meet Wang Di. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Di behaves in a low-key manner. Every time he returns to Chengdu, he comes and leaves quietly. This time I returned to Chengdu, there were many public events, and I couldn’t hide them. Everyone gathered together. &quot;I don&#39;t want to be the protagonist and let others do the activities for you.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He went to see his parents. My parents are in their nineties and live in a nursing home. A large number of books in Chengdu had been unused for many years, so he donated them to Sichuan University and let the graduate students divide them. Now, he misses those books a little bit. It was with those books that he wrote his first book - &quot;Out of the Closed World&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After so many years abroad, he used the newly collected research materials to write &quot;Street Culture&quot;, &quot;Brother Pao&quot;, &quot;Teahouse&quot; and other works. Chengdu Shuangliu District is currently preparing to build a Wang Di Documentation Center. The materials he collected will be placed here in the future and can be used by other researchers in need. Wang Di just visited this place. The documentation center has two floors and is very beautiful. Wang Hai is helping him do this. Wang Hai appeared in many of Wang Di&#39;s activities. He has a completely opposite personality to Wang Di. Even the word &quot;social cow&quot; is not enough to describe him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Macau, there are not many books on Wang Di’s bookshelf. He hardly collects books now. They are too heavy and inconvenient for him to use often. He mainly reads e-books and often listens to books. He has bad eyesight. He showed me the e-books he was reading, including Scott, Hayek, Wang Dingjun, and the newly minted Nobel Prize winner in Literature Anne Ernault. He wanted to tell the story of &quot;Tea House&quot; in the voice of a virtual century-old man, similar to Ernault&#39;s &quot;Unauthorized Autobiography&quot; in &quot;Years of Time&quot;. While Erno recalls himself, he also triggers the memories of others, and the resonance of memories shows the evolution of the times. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Di has been looking for these resonant moments in his memory. A lot of these moments are sinking. For example, when he was making bricks in a brick and tile factory, he was crowded into a large shed with twenty or thirty workers and had no private space of his own. While the workers were sleeping, he read under the lamp, but no one said that he kept the lamp on so late that it affected their sleep. The workers also made him a table out of scrap wood so that he could read and draw. &quot;It&#39;s probably the experience during that period that had a subtle influence on my later public view of history and the perspective of the lower class.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Youxing Bookstore, Wang Di talked about his generation, both Urban intellectuals who have been farmers and workers may be a unique generation in Chinese history. At the age of 22 - neither too early nor too late - he passed the sudden college entrance examination and turned his destiny around. At the age of 31, he became the youngest associate professor in the history department of a Chinese university at that time. When everything seemed to be going smoothly, he made the decision to go to the United States to study for graduate school and start over. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;In the United States&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;When Wang Di, associate professor of the History Department of Sichuan University, was preparing to continue his studies abroad, he received admission notices from the history departments of two American universities. One is Johns Hopkins University and the other is Columbia University. He chose the former and studied for a doctorate with the famous American historian William Rowe. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;William Luo recommended Wang Di to read &quot;Cheese and Maggots&quot; by Carlo Ginzburg. This is Wang Di’s first time reading a micro-historical work. Ginzburg used the Inquisition archives to write the spiritual history of Menocchio, a small rural miller in northern Italy in the 16th century. Menocchio saw the universe as a piece of cheese riddled with maggots. The original work is in Italian, and the English version Wang Di read happens to be published by Johns Hopkins University Press. He read this micro-history classic countless times, and later in the New Cultural History discussion class he taught, he went over the details of the book with his students again and again. He believes that such intensive reading and discussion are more useful than giving students a long book list. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Di writes micro history. His three major topics were fully discussed with William Luo. When William Luo teaches his students, he doesn’t just tell them what he is good at, and then just let the students write about what they are good at. &quot;The students themselves have to have this impulse, and the teacher helps to deepen it. It does not mean that the teacher has a big idea and then assigns it to the students.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When he discussed writing his doctoral thesis with William Luo, there was no &quot; The word &quot;street culture&quot; &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(street culture)&lt;/span>;. &quot;I introduced this concept first, and he said yes. I think students should think independently and deepen continuously. The teacher should make the problem concrete, rather than letting the teacher think for him.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Di has been practicing this Take a microscopic view of history. He feels that this requires more adaptation and understanding for us readers who are accustomed to historical writing having great significance and grand narratives. It’s not about more and more detailed historical writing, it’s about micro history. &quot;If we write a book about Zeng Guofan or Hu Shi, no matter how detailed and detailed it is, it will not be what we call micro history. One of the prerequisites of micro history is to write the history of ordinary people.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ginzburg advocated paying attention to &quot;the persecuted and subjugated people&quot; because these people are often &quot;dismissed or even completely ignored by many historians as marginal figures.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When Wang Di was writing his doctoral thesis &quot;Street Culture&quot; using micro-historical methods, his supervisor William Luo was writing &quot;Salvation - Chen Hongmou and the Elite Consciousness of Eighteenth-Century China&quot;. William Luo believes that this Qing Dynasty official, who was born in Hengshan Village, Lingui, Guangxi, can see the mentality of the elite at that time. This is a model of &quot;managing the world&quot; and the epitome of the prosperous Qing Dynasty. Obviously the research that Wang Di is interested in is different, but this does not prevent them from going to the Library of Congress to look up materials together. &quot;This may be the place with the most books and materials in the world.&quot; Luo William went to find Chen Hongmou, and Wang Di went to the teahouse. William Luo would ask Wang Di how to translate these lines of Chen Hongmou&#39;s poems appropriately. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/6ctY5BDmIsGaal8JWH6ziptVp4brWrixf8H8sMXY.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/6ctY5BDmIsGaal8JWH6ziptVp4brWrixf8H8sMXY.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252390&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Wang Di shared with readers in Chengdu&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Hua Xiaofeng/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;William Luo He expressed his thoughts in the introduction to &quot;Salvation&quot;: &quot;Now it seems that narrative works and intensive reading of historical texts are completely necessary. The emphasis on micro history has made the detailed study of the personal lives of historical figures extremely valuable. High status. &quot;Cheese and Maggots&quot; by Italian historian Carlo Ginzburg is a classic in micro-historical research. This makes me suspect that in this era, a scholar spent a lot of time studying a male elite Is it the most effective way to do research with an important political figure? Many articles published by Giovanni Levi, a high-spirited Italian historian, in the &quot;Annals&quot; eloquently prove: Those who study big figures, such as Proper treatment, like the study of small figures, can help us understand past history.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many people will also think that Wang Di&#39;s micro-historical research is similar to another historian Yang Nianqun&#39;s study of emperors. research will produce conflicts and contradictions. Wang Di doesn&#39;t see it that way. &quot;Actually, what we are saying is not contradictory. History is indeed determined by emperors and elites in many cases. He is telling the truth, but what I express is a view of history. Those who rule people should study it, and the people who are ruled should also study it. Yang Nianqun Studying the emperor does not mean that he agrees with the emperor&#39;s approach.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Di learned a lot from William Luo, including that a mentor does not dominate everything. Wang Di now teaches students New Cultural History at the University of Macau. Read original English works such as &quot;Cheese and Maggots&quot; by Ginzburg and &quot;The Return of Martin Guerre&quot; by Natalie Zemon Davis. Read a book every two weeks, 3 hours a week, and discuss a book 6 hours a week. He works out every detail with his students. He encourages students to think independently and put forward different opinions to teachers with reason and evidence. Sometimes the opinions are right, but sometimes they are not necessarily right. The opinions of both teachers and students are not unquestionable. &quot;This is a way of dialogue, not to prove who is right or wrong. Sometimes everyone uses the same information in different ways. There are multiple perspectives for interpreting history, but everything is based on careful reading. Go up.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As mentioned before, Wang Di also received an admission notice from the History Department of Columbia University that year. The person who admitted him was historian Zeng Xiaoping &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>; (Madeleine Zelin) &lt;/span>;. Her representative work is &quot;Zigong Merchants: Entrepreneurs in Early Modern China&quot; 》. When Wang Di&#39;s doctoral thesis &quot;Street Culture&quot; was published by Stanford University Press, one of the anonymous external reviewers was Zeng Xiaoping. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/DGR4RJsBSdLmhTvu9Dw6YAKtsXlcI4mdZ4e3SaqI.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/DGR4RJsBSdLmhTvu9Dw6YAKtsXlcI4mdZ4e3SaqI.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252389&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Wang Di growing vegetables on the balcony&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Southern People Weekly reporter Fang Yingzhong/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Zeng Xiaoping wrote six or seven pages of comments for &quot;Street Culture&quot;, which is equivalent to a small essay. She gave Wang Di many suggestions for revision, one of which was: the point of view of this book is not very clear. This troubled Wang Di. &quot;I asked William Luo how to highlight the main points. William Luo told me a method. He said, you use one sentence to summarize each chapter, and then you combine these words in each chapter into a paragraph, and the theme of that paragraph This sentence is your main point. This is amazing.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2005, &quot;Street Culture&quot; won the Best Book Award from the American Society for Urban History Research. Wang Di is grateful to both Zeng Xiaoping and Luo William. He has benefited a lot from the strict review questions and the effective methods to solve them. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;William Luo is over seventy years old, less than ten years older than Wang Di. Sometimes, Wang Di would ask William Luo for advice. 2019, co-recommended by William Luo and his colleague Tobie Meyer-Fong at Hopkins University , Wang Di was selected as the school&#39;s outstanding alumnus &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(Soecity of Scholars)&lt;/span>;, which is a great honor. Wang Di was originally going to the United States to attend an awards ceremony and attend a dinner hosted by the principal in the spring of 2020. He had invited William Luo to attend, but due to epidemic restrictions, he was unable to make the trip. This was his biggest regret during the epidemic. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the American history community, it is not easy for Chinese professors to gain recognition. Wang Di talked about He Bingdi and Huang Renyu, thinking that they are two extreme examples of Chinese American historical scholars. &quot;He Bingdi&#39;s research method is orthodox in the field of American history. He pays attention to empirical evidence and can be recognized professionally. He has had a smooth sailing. He served as the president of the Asia Society of America in the 1970s. This is not easy. Huang Renyu is the other extreme. His The book is written in the style of big history, such as &quot;The Fifteen Years of Wanli&quot;, which lacks a basis for case study and is difficult to be accepted by American historians. Therefore, the publication of his book in the United States suffered many setbacks, and in the end he even lost his teaching position. Huang Renyu&#39;s books span thousands of years and are very comfortable to read. Today, Huang Renyu&#39;s reputation among readers is far greater than that of He Bingdi, and &quot;Yellow River and Green Mountains&quot; is more shocking to read than &quot;Sixty Years of Reading History and Reading the World&quot;.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p >;When Wang Di taught at Texas A&amp;M University, he was the only Chinese professor in the history department. As he gets older, the biggest headache for Wang Di is the inconvenient transportation. There is an airport in the university. If he wants to return to China, he needs to take a small plane from the university town to Houston, Austin or Dallas, then fly to Los Angeles or San Francisco, and then fly to Beijing or Shanghai. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He has taught in the United States for 17 years, from assistant professor to full professor, and felt that he needed to change his environment. When the University of Macau offered him an olive branch, he accepted it and came to the University of Macau in 2015. After a year of adapting, he stayed and served as chairman of the History Department of the University of Macau and as a chair professor to this day. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Rolling waves&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In Macau, Wang Di often eats in the canteen, or solves problems at home with noodles and frozen dumplings. When I occasionally cook Sichuan cuisine, I take the simplest approach and use hot pot base ingredients to cook various side dishes. The Hengqin campus of the University of Macau is connected to Macau through an undersea tunnel. It is like a small society, so Wang Di can stay away from the hustle and bustle. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;His desk faces the balcony diagonally, and the ship outside the floor-to-ceiling window passes through the traffic artery of reality and history. He seems to be living between history and reality. He is a scholar who has both a sense of history and a sense of reality. He hopes to use his thinking about history to make sense of the present. &quot;History is full of contingency and has no rules, but history can help us think.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are many pictures and photos on the wall outside Wang Di&#39;s office, including an introduction to his professional research and photos of his daily life. One of the photos is from a college class reunion in 2000. The students are playing mahjong. Wang Di cannot play mahjong, and before studying teahouses, he rarely went to teahouses. He doesn&#39;t look like a typical Chengdu person. Maybe a &quot;street kid&quot; like his classmate Wang Hai is. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Di may have wanted to be a painter more than Wang Hai. His illustrations often appear in his books, such as the Heming Teahouse where we are chatting. He drew one based on the photo. He drew many portraits for &quot;The Whisper of History&quot;. &quot;This is in line with my philosophy. They are people I admire. I draw ideas and reflections from them. To display these requires artistic techniques and some illustrations. I don&#39;t like to simply put photos. &quot;The Tea Shop on the Corner &quot;I also drew illustrations. The idea of ​​drawing illustrations was a consensus reached by me and Li Lei, the editor in charge of these two books.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Over the years, Wang Di has published many books in China, many of which You need to queue up to get to each publishing house to avoid crashing on the press. He is very satisfied with the &quot;Wang Di&#39;s Works Series&quot; being launched by the People&#39;s Literature Publishing House. &quot;The editor-in-chief Li Lei thought of a lot of options just for the title of each book. In terms of literary expression and public reading and promotion, it is also He gave me a lot of tips and suggestions, and arranged a conversation between me and Xu Jilin at the Shanghai Book Fair, as well as Zhang Mingyang and I’s activities in Sinan, Shanghai.” Wang Di said that in the United States for more than 20 years, the things he published were not many. &quot;I went to the United States in 1991. By 2015, I had only published two English books and one Chinese book in 24 years. It was very few, but a lot of things were accumulated, and after accumulation, they would explode.&quot; Wang Di is 67 years old this year . There is a saying that the age between 60 and 70 is the golden period for a historian. Wang Di is in such a period. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the way to Heming Tea House, he had been listening to books. &quot;I have bad eyesight, so I keep my eyes open for writing.&quot; He is a person who cherishes time. When he gets up in the morning, he rinses his mouth and brushes his teeth, cooks and eats, and listens to books. He said that his life is composed of three books: writing, reading, and teaching. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Macau, following Wang Di’s instructions, I found Morrison’s tomb in the corner behind a church in front of White Pigeon Nest. On the site in front of the tomb, there were several workers pulling wires to measure. It was estimated that the church and cemetery needed repairs. A few children were playing football in front of the church, and they would run over only when the ball went into the yard. The area in front of the White Pigeon Nest is a public space, and most of the people here are old people playing chess. Tradition is as solid as stone. Wang Di said that similar scenes can be seen in Hong Kong and San Francisco. Some of the components of public space that are inherited from tradition do not change with time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In September 2023, I also saw people playing chess in front of the Guanyin Pavilion Teahouse in Peng Town, Shuangliu, Chengdu. They sat there all morning. Wang Di&#39;s &quot;Teahouse&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(Part 2)&lt;/span>;&quot; recounts Zhang Rong&#39;s memories in &quot;Hong: The Story of Three Generations of Chinese Women&quot;. Many teahouses in Chengdu were forcibly closed at the beginning of the Cultural Revolution. &quot;One boy even lifted the chessboard and all the chess pieces fell on the floor, shouting: &#39;No chess! Don&#39;t you know this is a bourgeois hobby?&#39; Then he threw the chess pieces and the board into the river. Some students were in the teahouse. Paint slogans on the walls.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During the &quot;Destroy the Four Olds&quot; movement, teahouses were impacted, where drinking tea &quot;was seen as a bad habit of the old society, and tea shops were seen as harboring dirt and evil. The teahouses were forcibly banned and closed down as a gathering place for class dissidents and backward masses.” At this time, Laohu Zao still played an important role in the lives of Chengdu residents. In the 1960s, Chengdu residents were short of fuel at home, so the boiling water provided by Laohu Zao was more convenient and cheaper than boiling water themselves. There are fewer people drinking tea in teahouses, but the number of people buying boiled water to make tea at home has not decreased.茶铺起到水铺的作用。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在茶馆研究的问题上，王笛关心的是，是否地区或地方的研究可以提供理解中国社会和文化的普遍性知识。 “微观研究的意义在于，能够为把对历史的认识上升到一个更广义的层次提供个案分析，其不仅能丰富我们对地方的知识，而且有助于我们对中国的理解。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;国家与社会关系问题，是西方研究中国历史的一个着眼点。在1980年代末和1990年代初，罗威廉使用公共领域&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;（public sphere）&lt;/span>;这一概念来研究近代中国时，遭到不少学者反对，他们认为哈贝马斯的概念不适用于中国。 “20世纪下半叶的中国有相当长一段时间，便处于有&#39;国家&#39;无&#39;社会&#39;的时代，国家掌握了政治、经济、社会、文化的一切资源，这是此前任何政权未能实现的。传统的&#39;公&#39;的领域也几乎不复存在。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;姜文导演的《让子弹飞》已然是当代中国电影的经典之作，其中的桥段脍炙人口，在各种社交场合被频频引用。电影改编自马识途《夜谭十记》中的《盗官记》。在《盗官记》里，有这么一段对成都茶馆的细致描述：&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;你们去过成都吗？那里有一个少城公园，少城公园里有一个鹤鸣茶社。在那里有一块颇大的空坝子，都盖着凉棚，面临绿水涟漪，是个好的风景去处。凉棚下摆满茶桌和竹椅，密密麻麻坐满喝茶的茶客，热闹得很。到处听到互相打招呼、寒暄问好的声音，到处是茶倌放下铜盘叫着“开水”的声音。这是一个普通的茶座，那些做小生意的、当教员的等等小市民们，就在这里来谋事，说合，讲交情，做买卖，吵架，扯皮，参加“六腊之战”，“吃讲茶”……&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这是曾经的鹤鸣茶社，许多情状还在，许多则已成往事。比如说“六腊之战”，指的是每年六月和腊月是学校教员受聘期满的月份，教员们为了争取继续聘用，四处奔走，为生活而战。 “吃讲茶”则是双方发生争执时，会请袍哥主持公道，双方在茶馆谈判，或和或打，就看这茶吃得怎样。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/SM7mhTluQgqDzzOqCC5msjUxrmhRjmqhEIuapyiR.jpg&quot;

&lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;王笛在成都鹤鸣茶社拍摄茶客&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（华小峰/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;马识途的小说写的是民国时的事情。 1949年之后，马识途的回忆是这样的：&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;既然茶馆不再是能支持革命的地方，我们必须坚决地消除它们。因此，茶馆倒闭了。尽管人们不喜欢这种不便，但他们除了无条件服从外，无能为力。实际上，一些有识之士认为我们可以取茶馆之益而去其之弊，当然，这样的话，茶馆的弊处将会完全被消除，茶馆将成为一个文化活动中心以及宣传教育的场所。但当局没有听见这些声音，因此，茶馆在四川大地上几乎消失殆尽。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;王笛觉得鹤鸣茶社的历史几乎可以单独提出来独立成书，鹤鸣茶社的历史就是一部波澜起伏的电影，而不同人的眼中，有不同的茶和历史——&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;看到同样的历史资料，人和人理解不一样。我们今天在鹤鸣茶社，可能不同的人有不同的感受。有的人可能看到脏乱差，有的人看到的是人和人在聊天社交，有的人看到茶倌在忙着掺茶，有的是看到谋生的人，有的看到掏耳朵的人，有的是看到我们在这聊天，摆着书，还有人在旁边照相。每个人看到的都不一样。本来这就是一个大千世界。卡尔·波普尔说，我们写不出整体的历史，包括鹤鸣茶社，我们都写不出整体的历史。我们看到的只是通过个体的眼睛，或者个体的研究者来理解的历史，任何历史都只是部分的历史。每个人写的都是碎片，不可能是全面的历史。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;有的人说成都很好啊，有的人说成都就是大家无所事事。同样的事情，有的是积极的，有的是消极的。大家的经历不一样。有的工作很满意，有的始终找不到好工作，能说感受是一样的吗？历史就这样复杂，没有标准，也没有规律。相信历史有规律是很可怕的事情。过去的三年，病毒让全球都改变了。这有什么必然性啊。三年前，没有人预见得到疫情对世界的改变。所谓规律，是可以预见到的未来，历史真的不是这样的，很多时候只是人的一念之差。我们的现代社会，整个人类文明，不是人为设计的，一个社会自然进化可能更合理。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;王笛从鹤鸣茶社旁边人头攒动的餐饮店里买了几碗水饺，这是我们的午餐。他说起吃的历史。 “我读幼儿园的时候，吃不饱饭，我还记得，小孩子跟着老师去其他班看看有没有剩下的饭，没有啊。这样的饿肚子的事情，就是人为设计的结果。”王笛生于1956年。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;他表达了他对整个中国历史的看法。 “我们要让社会充分发展。举个简单的例子，如果大家都在泰坦尼克号这样的大船上，如果在正确的航道上，大家没感觉有什么，一旦出现问题，大家就都完蛋。如果我们分乘50条船往前走，看起来缺乏效率，但哪一种选择更安全，这是非常简单的道理。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在《茶馆&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;（上）&lt;/span>;》的尾声，王笛用了《寻梦》作为标题。他用非常感性的笔触描述了1949年的最后一天：&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;在过去的50年里，他们所光顾的茶馆，他们视为理所当然的坐茶馆的生活习惯，竟一直是国家权力与地方社会、文化的同一性和独特性较量的“战场”。他们每天到茶馆吃茶，竟然就是他们拿起“弱者的武器”所进行的“弱者的反抗”。这也即是说，弱小而手无寸铁的茶馆经理人、堂倌和茶客们，在这50年的反复鏖战中，任凭茶碗中波澜翻滚，茶桌上风云变幻，他们犹如冲锋陷阵的勇士，为茶馆和日常文化的最终胜利，立下了汗马功劳。如果他们知道自己在捍卫地方文化中所扮演的关键角色，就不会嘲笑这位通过时间机器突然降临、要为他们撰写历史的小同乡了。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“小同乡”指的是王笛自己。 2023年9月，王笛第九次来到成都双流彭镇观音阁茶馆，时间机器仿佛再次启程。他毫无意外地再次看到了在那里打牌的甘大爷和胡大爷。老板李强用老虎灶上取下来的水壶给他们的茶杯里倒入鲜开水，波澜翻滚。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在王笛叙述的那些试图改变世界的大人物眼中，他们想着的是世界的波澜翻滚，而不是这碗茶。王笛在《历史的微声》最后一章中，提到了他脑海里浮现过的一个画面：“帝王或者英雄站在高高的山巅上，俯瞰整个大地，为自己马上要创造历史，而心潮澎湃，豪情万丈。极目望去，在他的眼中，是乌泱泱的人海，芸芸众生，小如蝼蚁。对他来说，面对这样的人海，多一个不多，少一个也不少，个体在这里已经失去了意义；个体的命运，在这里是无关大局的；芸芸众生之间，是没有区别的，甚至看不清他们的面孔。他们没有自己的故事，也没有自己的历史，当然也就没有自己的未来。如果这些芸芸众生为了帝王或者英雄所谓的&#39;宏大事业&#39;而死去，就无声无息地化为了尘土。在宏大的历史叙事中，个体是整体完全可以忽视的东西，这就是整体史的本质。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在观音阁茶馆，王笛走到甘大爷和胡大爷旁边，再次拍下了许多照片。而正在打牌的两位大爷对此习以为常，连眼皮都没抬一下。每天上午都出现在茶馆里，用一杯一块钱的茶度过一个上午，这样波澜不惊的生活也许才是最正常最让人安心的生活。王笛告诉我，“人民能够日复一日、年复一年预期到他们能够过着安静和平的生活，难道这不就是最宏大的叙事吗？”&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;真实是什么？ &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;王笛在办公室收到了四川大学学报寄给他的期刊。期刊的开篇便是他写的论文《“啯匪”和“会匪”：哥老会起源的新思考》。秘密会社一直是他所关心的主题。当年的《袍哥》是这一研究过程中的插曲。和袍哥有关的大量材料需要更丰富的形式来表现。对沈宝媛论文的研究，更像是对《奶酪与蛆虫》的一次具体的借鉴。 “原本并不打算写微观史，只是正好有这么一个资料。”意大利偏远地区的故事勾起他对四川乡下一起案件的联系。这正说明文明当中的许多形式具有共性，我们跟世界并不是那么不一样。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;最近他会写到“三支半香”，会写到哥老会现实和精神的起源。他会运用霍布斯鲍姆《传统的发明》所提到的理念。袍哥联系着更繁复而未明的历史。如何认识这些故事，如何认识文本，如何认识档案，是重要的事情。 “不要认为记载在档案上的东西就是历史。档案的真实性并不比别人写的小说更真实。”王笛说起二十四史。 “二十四史就是官修的历史。这是皇帝希望我们相信的历史。许多历史经过伪造、修改，甚至销毁。如果没有二十四史，今天留给我们的历史，也许不是更少，而是更多。这些官修的历史有多少真实性？我敢说百分之一的真实性都没有。官修的历史只能代表官方，跟每个人的经历有出入。我反复强调，一个学者要有批判精神，包括对史料和历史写作的批判，没有批判的话，你的写作没有任何意义。当然，每个人都没法写出完全真实的历史，我们只是力图写出接近真实的历史。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/TTdxD1WmktHHLBUgJQWhAr8LLxHBF2fPhclLVsnm.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/27/TTdxD1WmktHHLBUgJQWhAr8LLxHBF2fPhclLVsnm.jpg&quot;

&lt;p>;成都是和茶馆相连的，茶馆让成都成为成都。 “到口子上啖三花”曾经是成都人的口头禅，就像北京人说“您吃了吗”一样。不一定真的去喝茶或吃饭。一种可以成为日常口语的指代物，说明这件事情在日常生活中的重要。在口子上，在街角，那种传统茶铺不好找了。所以，游客们会去双流彭镇的茶馆打卡。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;王笛在观音阁茶馆门口跟老板李强聊起过去。他觉得观音阁茶馆现在的“两张皮”挺好。 “一张皮”是网红打卡之地。他们在这里喝一碗茶10块钱，买了茶可以喝茶休息拍照。 “另一张皮”是当地茶客的日常生活，以甘大爷和胡大爷每天雷打不动出现在茶馆为标志，他们用的是大茶杯，茶叶不一样，1块钱。两者相辅相成，构成了一个传统和现实融合的空间。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这里是成都历史为数不多的“活化石”之一。未硬化的室内泥地，土木结构的空间，竹椅、温水瓶、茶碗、老虎灶，各种嘈杂声随之而来。这是现实的声音，也是历史的回声。这是王笛所说的“历史的微声”。这里，普通的个体不是一个个抽象数字，而是一个个具体的人。他们喝着茶，打着牌，聊着天，将生活日复一日地进行下去。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 04 Oct 2023 10:25:05 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[专访魏纪中：亚运会溢出的正面社会效应越来越大]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258062]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-04 09:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;87 is an age long overdue for retirement, but Wei Jizhong plans to work longer. &quot;The healthiest person in New China&quot;

&lt;p style=&quot;color: # 999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On September 22, 2023, Wei Jizhong, the lifelong honorary vice president of the Olympic Council of Asia, answered reporters&#39; questions at the media briefing of the Olympic Council of Asia and the Hangzhou Asian Organizing Committee. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1958, there were two roads before Wei Jizhong: one led to the People&#39;s Literature Publishing House, This is in line with the outside world&#39;s expectations for a graduate of Nanjing University&#39;s French literature major; another path leads to the National Sports Commission (now the State Sports General Administration), which stems from the inner expectations of a young volleyball player. Wei Jizhong decided to follow his heart. He is fluent in English and French, which allowed him to quickly participate in the external relations of New China Sports. He is one of the people in the country who has the most contacts with International Olympic Committee President Juan Antonio Samaranch. During his sixty-five years of ambitious sports work, he participated in almost all major sports events in New China. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since 1986, Wei Jizhong has served as the Secretary-General of the Chinese Olympic Committee, and then became the Vice-Chairman of the Chinese Olympic Committee. Wei Jizhong believes that sports can show a more &quot;open&quot; China to the world. Wei Jizhong, who is well versed in the rules of international sports affairs, has held many important positions in the International Volleyball Federation and the Asian Olympic Council. People believe that Wei Jizhong was one of the key figures in the successful Beijing Olympic bid in 2008. He put forward many constructive suggestions for the Olympic bid and was the &quot;bridge&quot; between the Chinese Olympic Committee and the International Olympic Committee. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During the Hangzhou Asian Games, Wei Jizhong still maintained high energy. His work schedule was full and he had to stay until the end of the Asian Games. As the lifelong honorary vice president of the Olympic Council of Asia, Wei Jizhong participated in the official press conference of the Asian Organizing Committee, accepted media interviews, and responded to issues related to the Asian Games. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On September 29, 2023, Wei Jizhong accepted an exclusive interview with a Southern Weekend reporter in Hangzhou. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;More and more countries and regions hope to host the Asian Games&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_ GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;The Hangzhou Asian Games is the third Asian Games hosted by China. What are the differences between the hosting backgrounds of the three Asian Games? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Wei Jizhong:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;When we held the Beijing Asian Games in 1990, it was mainly for external needs after the reform and opening up. That Asian Games was originally supposed to be held in Hiroshima, Japan. Later, we negotiated with the Hiroshima Organizing Committee of Japan through the Olympic Council of Asia and asked them to give us the 1990 Asian Games first, and then they would host the 1994 Asian Games. The committee agreed, and we were qualified to host the Asian Games in Beijing in 1990. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the 2010 Guangzhou Asian Games, some changes occurred in the political background. After Comrade Xiaoping&#39;s talks in the south, reform and opening up entered a new stage. Against this background, Guangzhou began to bid for the Asian Games. Hangzhou&#39;s hosting of the Asian Games is based on the obvious achievements of the entire reform and opening up. We must further open up and use opening up to promote reform. Against this background, we applied to host the Hangzhou Asian Games again. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After hosting the Asian Games three times, the overall environment of the entire country and the overall environment of the world are different. So I say that every Asian Games has its own significance, and in addition to the significance of sports, it also has different social and political significance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/03/FSA2O42Krc4eDfhf3DkveyWV4GpZ9TkYDjONwvS9.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/03/FSA2O42Krc4eDfhf3DkveyWV4GpZ9TkYDjONwvS9.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252970&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;September 2023, Hangzhou Olympic Sports Center Stadium at night. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: italics, Italics_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;The Asian Games have been held for a total of nineteen times. This is your eleventh time to participate in the Asian Games. In your opinion, is the Asian Games becoming more and more difficult to host? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Wei Jizhong:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;My opinion is exactly the opposite. Judging from the current situation, more and more countries and regions hope to host the Asian Games: the next one will be held in Nagoya, Japan, and Japan will be followed by countries and regions such as Qatar and Saudi Arabia. Therefore, the Asian Games is becoming more and more difficult to host and is inconsistent with the actual situation. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, from the perspective of our hosting of the Asian Games, in addition to promoting the development of sports, the positive social effects of the Asian Games are getting bigger and bigger. In 2006, Qatar took the opportunity of hosting the Asian Games to transform Qatar from a relatively simple oil export economy into a relatively comprehensive open economy. At that time, Qatar only had one international hotel and no high-rise buildings. If you go to Doha (the capital of Qatar) today and see it, everything has changed. Since the Doha (Asian Games), many countries and regions have realized that the social and economic benefits overflowed by hosting the Asian Games can promote the development of the entire country. This is an increasingly consistent understanding. Moreover, the Olympic Council of Asia also helps various countries and regions to produce relatively sustained social and economic benefits while hosting the Asian Games. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;In order to let more countries win medals&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>; In 1990, the Beijing Asian Games had 27 major events and 308 minor events (gold medals). The Hangzhou Asian Games had 40 major events and 481 minor events (gold medals). The Asian Games had many events, many types, and many gold medals. Why would the Asian Games consider setting up so many events? , will this reduce the competitiveness of sports? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Wei Jizhong:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Why have we added so many projects? The purpose is to promote the development of sports in Asia, mainly in developing countries. After years of exploration, we have found that (this) mainly relies on the support of the government and the recognition of sports by the whole society. These two points can be achieved through the Asian Games. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We set up more events to enable athletes from more countries and regions to achieve good results in the Asian Games, that is, to win medals. For a country where sports are relatively underdeveloped, if athletes can win gold medals or medals through their performance at the Asian Games, it will be an inspiration to the people and the government will be satisfied. Once the government is satisfied, it will have more support for other sports. Therefore, we at the Asian Olympic Committee have adopted an open policy. These open policies are to allow athletes from some sports underdeveloped countries to have the opportunity to participate in the activities of the Asian Games family. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Olympic Games is mainly a competition for some elite athletes. Of course, it also takes care of the masses, but it is mainly a competition for elite athletes. Therefore, the International Olympic Committee and the Organizing Committee bear all costs. The Asian Games is a paid event, which means each athlete and official must pay US$50 per day. Of course, this 50 US dollars is not enough (to cover the cost), and the organizing committee will subsidize them some. For example, the meal standard for athletes at the Hangzhou Asian Games is 500 yuan, which exceeds the fees paid. The government&#39;s willingness to pay to allow athletes to participate in competitions shows the government&#39;s support for sports. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Now, more and more athletes are participating in the Asian Games, which has exceeded the number of participants in the Olympic Games. This shows that Asian sports are developing. We set up more projects, especially some local traditional projects, so that more national and regional Olympic committees can achieve results at the games. Now, the proportion of medals won by the Olympic committees of the countries and regions we participate in has exceeded 80%. Doing so can indeed promote sports and development in developing countries and regions, and society will increasingly recognize sports. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;E-sports is one of the projects that has attracted much attention at the Hangzhou Asian Games. Regarding the entry of e-sports into Asia, the Olympic Council of Asia, the State Sports General Administration and the Hangzhou Asian Organizing Committee have conducted many studies and discussions. How was the final decision made? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Wei Jizhong:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;E-sports was developed from video games and is similar to traditional sports. Some traditional sports, including football, basketball, and volleyball, have also transitioned from popular entertainment projects to formal competitions. Video games and e-sports have a large and wide-ranging group. Professional players come from this group. Their talents in traditional sports may not be that high, but they may have greater development in e-sports. Since such a group exists, we cannot ignore it. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We have a process of understanding e-sports. E-sports is a sport. This is controversial because e-sports does not match the definition of sports in the dictionary. However, from a sports perspective, the competitive side of e-sports is consistent with the definition of sports. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Chairman Mao Zedong said, &quot;Develop sports and enhance people&#39;s physical fitness.&quot; He distinguished sports from sports. The two have similarities and differences. I agree with the view that e-sports is not only a sport, but also a cultural and creative project. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We have continued to communicate with the International Olympic Committee on this issue, and e-sports has continued to improve. The International Olympic Committee has gradually recognized that e-sports has many aspects in common with traditional sports. Therefore, the International Olympic Committee first proposed the virtualization of the Olympic movement, and now it has established an e-sports committee. This means that our understanding of traditional sports and e-sports are moving towards each other and are beginning to merge. The purpose is to enable more young people or enthusiasts to enter the Olympic family. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We are now discussing how e-sports can enter this comprehensive sports meeting. The Hangzhou Asian Games treats it as an event alongside traditional sports. Other comprehensive sports games, such as the Commonwealth Games, South American Games or African Games, take another approach, which is to juxtapose e-sports as a business format with traditional sports formats. Within the scope of a large sports meeting, there are two business situation. How to better integrate is also being discussed. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“The nationwide system is still applicable”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Always There is a voice that although we have hosted the Asian Games and Olympic Games and are competitive for gold medals in most sports events, it seems that mass sports or the masses&#39; enthusiasm for sports is still not enough. What do you think of this problem? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Wei Jizhong: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;It is important to pay attention to the gold medal, but paying too much attention to the gold medal will lead to what we used to call &quot;championshipism.&quot; If you fall into championshipism, sometimes it will have some negative effects, such as using any means to win the championship. Results are important, but they don&#39;t mean everything. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We cannot ignore mass sports. Through hosting the Asian Games and Olympic Games, the public&#39;s understanding of sports has been continuously improved. For example, before we host the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics, we proposed the initiative of hundreds of millions of people participating in winter sports, and it was basically realized before the Winter Olympics were held. This shows that people&#39;s awareness of sports is constantly improving, so their enthusiasm for participation is also high. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The question is, how do we organize them well? Competitive sports and mass sports are two aspects, but these two aspects are interoperable. We implement this aspect: professional athletes in competitive sports emerge from the mass system; the improvement of professional sports will inevitably provide guidance to mass sports. So I think popularization and improvement become a matter of interaction. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You have a point, the national system is still ours in competitive sports The advantage lies in. Nowadays, the development of some major ball sports is encountering some difficulties. What do you think is the path to professionalization under the current environment? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Wei Jizhong:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;The nationwide system is applicable to both competitive sports and mass sports. In fact, this nationwide system and centralized training of elites are also found in other countries. This is a professional sport, and the Olympic movement gradually transitions from amateurism to professionalism, and finally accepts a certain degree of professionalism. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The basic path is mass, professional and professional. From professionalism to professionalism, there is the issue of commercialization. Regarding the issue of commercialization, I always remember what Chairman Samaranch told me during his lifetime: Sports must not be controlled by business, but sports can make use of business. Therefore, some of our projects are now developed on a market-oriented path, but they also need good support from the government. The nationwide system is still applicable. The question is, how to embody the nationwide system? Methods and methods may need to be reformed or improved. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“I can’t decide, and I don’t participate in the decision”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312 , STKaiti;&quot;>;You have done a lot of constructive work for the Chinese sports world. There are now some controversies outside, such as intervening in the appointment of the Chinese women&#39;s volleyball coach and the Chinese table tennis coach. How do you respond to these controversial issues? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Wei Jizhong:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I have been engaged in sports for more than 60 years, but from my point of view, I have always been an executor. I am not a sports person. leader of. There were some misunderstandings on the Internet in the past, thinking that I can decide everything. No, I can&#39;t decide, and I don&#39;t participate in the decision. The entire selection of athletes and coaches is decided by professionals and government sports leadership agencies. I only carry out the tasks given to me or accept the instructions from my superiors, so I would like to use this opportunity to clarify that I It cannot decide on the volleyball coach, nor will it interfere with table tennis. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I don’t have that much ability, nor do I have that much power to say that I decide all this and intervene in these decisions. I think this is (because) everyone doesn’t understand (the situation) well. Of course, some of my opinions may be wrong, and I accept everyone&#39;s criticism, but I absolutely cannot decide anything. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Since graduating from university in 1958, we have been working hard for decades The front line of sports has not yet retired. Where does your passion for sports come from? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Wei Jizhong: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Sports is mainly my interest and hobby. Although I am 87 years old, at the Hangzhou Asian Games, I still have to start from 7 in the morning Work until 10pm. Although I am retired, I should still use my spare energy when needed. It’s not that I must do something else, but once the country or some international sports organizations have such a need, I will try my best to do it within my ability, because sports are related to people’s health, national spirit and the masses. A public welfare undertaking that attracts attention. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;In the past two years, domestic sports projects and personnel Management is becoming increasingly tighter.

How to deal with these changes? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Wei Jizhong: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;We are now in a stage of alternation between the old and the new. In this period of alternation between old and new, there needs to be a certain running-in period. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I think from the perspective of the (sports) management, it may be in a running-in period. It is natural for some problems of one kind or another to occur during the running-in period. Precisely because of the running-in period, it is natural that the public will have different views on these issues. Some of the opinions of the masses may be relatively accurate, while others may be less accurate due to poor information. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The replacement of athletes and coaches is a process. This process needs to be adjusted and gradually improved. Therefore, on the one hand, we must shorten this process as much as possible; on the other hand, we must also admit that there is such a process. From the management to the masses, we work together to make this process smoother. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 04 Oct 2023 09:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[为什么要学英语？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258046]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-04 08:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;In a recent interview, Ren Zhengfei mentioned his views on English learning. He said: &quot;Learning in rural areas I understand that English is difficult, but if you put it through for a while, you will get through it, right? Maybe your oral expression is not that good, but you can do it if you have the ability to recognize words.&quot; This statement is quite pertinent to some of the popular opinions in the market. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It must be stated that whether a subject is useful to an individual&#39;s daily life cannot be used as a criterion for whether to enter a school for students to study. When it comes to the usefulness of daily life, how useful are physics, chemistry, history, and geography? It is enough to be able to calculate accounts and write in the third grade of primary school. Comparatively speaking, with the improvement of public education and the expansion of international exchanges, English has become more and more closely integrated with daily life: English is used when looking up certain knowledge and technologies, reading product manuals, and traveling abroad. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wikipedia information shows that as of March 25, 2020, W3Techs predicts that among the percentage of languages ​​used by the top one million Internet websites, English accounts for 59.3%. Chinese is 1.3%. Being more familiar with English is very useful for a person to increase his knowledge. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From a national level, to a large extent, Chinese people learn foreign languages ​​to learn advanced foreign technologies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Any teaching is a pyramid-shaped screening system. China has a huge sports school system, which begins to discover and transport talents for sports from the elementary school level. This is the basis for Chinese athletes to win trophies in various competitions. Similarly, only if everyone starts learning addition and subtraction from the first grade, and then learns Newton&#39;s three laws in junior middle school, conservation of momentum, and the law of conservation of mechanical energy in high school, then there will be one in a hundred thousand or one in a million Mathematical Olympiad champions and Nobel laureates. Winner of the Bell Prize in Physics. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The same is true for English. Only by starting to learn it in elementary school and taking English exams in college can we select the most cutting-edge people who are proficient in English and can engage in various researches. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some people say that you should learn English wherever necessary. Top talents can just learn English well. However, in elementary school, middle school and high school, no one could predict what would happen later. If the school system gives a signal that English is not important, and the college entrance examination succumbs to this trend and reduces the proportion of English, it will inevitably affect high school students’ attitude and enthusiasm for English learning. If high school students generally have poor English foundation, it will inevitably affect the overall English level of undergraduate students. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In some schools, some subjects for undergraduate students are taught in English, which is conducive to improving students&#39; professional English level and thus helping to keep up with the international advanced level. For example, if a Chinese scholar publishes an academic paper in a foreign journal, the most common language is English. During the publication process, foreign peer experts review the manuscript and give their opinions. Publication is a kind of recognition. This will help Chinese scholars in this field develop in the right technical direction. In fact, this is a process of technological diffusion. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But if students generally have poor English after graduating from high school, English teaching will not be possible, and the possibility of publishing English papers abroad will become smaller. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Moreover, technology diffusion does not only occur at the &quot;high level&quot; such as publishing papers and participating in international seminars. Technology diffusion and exchanges occur in all fields and levels of production. In many cases, such as The scenes we imagine are more down-to-earth and ordinary. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During this period, generative AI has become popular. The United States is leading in this area, and China is also accelerating to catch up. If you want to use foreign generative AI, you need language skills from network settings, registration, writing prompts, and learning skills. For example, when it comes to AI-generated images and videos, a graphics, home decoration, and poster designer who is proficient in English can do it faster than a designer who lacks language skills. The latter will not even come into contact with this new thing because the language is too difficult. This can give the former a lead of half a year, a year, or even a few years, which will win customers and eventually the advantage will be solidified. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For another example, if a small business owner who makes handicrafts can frequently visit foreign technology exchange websites, he will be able to discover many wonderful ideas. Sometimes technology diffusion is just a matter of &quot;taking a look.&quot; However, if he does not have a basic knowledge of English, he will not go to these websites at all. He has neither the ability to find these websites nor the consciousness to do it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A very important reason why some people advocate learning less English or lowering English scores is that they think English is unfair to rural children. However, the paper &quot;Research on the LDFA Method and Its Application in Project Function Difference Analysis&quot;, based on the data of the National Education Examination Center, used a completely random sampling method to extract the English test scores of 2,500 people, and found that urban and rural areas have higher college entrance examination English scores. There is no significant difference, even in rural areas it is 0.45 points higher. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is unexpected, but it is reasonable. In fact, many studies have found that there is no need for English, especially test-oriented English. Language learning is nothing more than reading more, listening more, and memorizing more. Practice makes perfect. In the era of widespread smartphones, the cost of an English-speaking environment is very low. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Therefore, no matter from the perspective of the meaning of individual life, the progress of national technology, or the fairness of urban and rural education, English learning should not be underestimated, so that our children can be exposed to and discover the larger world. It can broaden your horizons and improve your knowledge and skills in professional fields when you grow up. This will remain true at least for quite some time to come. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 04 Oct 2023 08:25:02 +0800</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[专访编剧芦苇：好的电影都有社会意义]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257491]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-03 23:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/ 11/17/4KPKFBskeYDrgulnOVPH0EoLBcUkSvZLTvnf5oxp.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1460&quot; height=&quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/11/17/4KPKFBskeYDrgulnOVPH0EoLBcUkSvZLTvnf5oxp . jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;215549&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&quot;Farewell My Concubine&quot;, &quot;Alive&quot;, &quot;Tuya&#39;s Marriage&quot;, etc. written by Lu Wei The film won awards at international film festivals such as Cannes and Berlin.

Since then, a series of works such as &quot;Farewell My Concubine&quot;, &quot;Alive&quot; and &quot;Tuya&#39;s Marriage&quot; have won awards at international film festivals such as Cannes and Berlin. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The day before his departure, his study was a little messy. The walls and table were covered with large and small paintings and photographs. There was a note nailed to the wooden board against the wall, written in Lu Wei&#39;s handwriting: &quot;Make up your mind to write &quot;The Legend of the Seven Stars of the Swordsman&quot;! This is a key battle to fulfill your long-cherished wish.

I wrote the script according to the logic of commercial feature films and shot it.&quot; At that time, I was thinking about subversion. Fortunately, I met Lu Wei at the crossroads of my life. After having an in-depth chat with him, I felt that I was wrong at the time.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm .com/cms/medias/image/22/11/17/Ta0G4w0jM7lD47dWQsZBKrodMftFgHM2giAEsMzj.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;1280&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias /image/22/11/17/Ta0G4w0jM7lD47dWQsZBKrodMftFgHM2giAEsMzj.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;215553&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&quot;Farewell My Concubine&quot; won gold After receiving the Palme d&#39;Or, director Chen Kaige (left) took a photo with Lu Wei. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of interviewee)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias /image/22/11/17/wxqP5AVXWMVEdnvQZH5Y4aipKbgEDI9rLDT4KG9a.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1281&quot; height=&quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/22/11 /17/wxqP5AVXWMVEdnvQZH5Y4aipKbgEDI9rLDT4KG9a.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;215551&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In 1992, Lu Wei and Gong Li (right) in &quot;Farewell&quot; Ji&quot; studio. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo courtesy of interviewee)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Luwei is greatly influenced by Hollywood movies and values ​​the watchability and social significance of movies. , has been working as a screenwriter for more than 30 years. He talks about the &quot;genre&quot; of movies more than the &quot;art&quot; of movies, and believes that there are no secrets to screenwriting. In the recently published book &quot;Film Screenwriters Have No Secrets&quot;, Lu Wei disclosed for the first time the detailed inside story of writing the script of &quot;Farewell My Concubine&quot;. What surprised some fans is that this film is currently the only film to win the &quot;Palme d&#39;Or&quot; award at the Cannes Film Festival. Lu Wei&#39;s requirements for the scripts of Chinese-language films are that they must be &quot;typified&quot; and the stories must be good-looking, reasonable, and true. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He said: &quot;The title of the first book talks about the &#39;secrets&#39; of film screenwriters. I don&#39;t like it. I think there are no secrets for film screenwriters, they are just rules. The new book published this time I I just want to tell everyone this.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In October 2022, Southern Weekend reporters interviewed Lu Wei in Xi&#39;an. At that time, the most important &quot;National Day&quot; prime period of the year did not achieve the expected results. In terms of box office results, the Chinese mainland film market has rarely experienced a severe &quot;film shortage&quot; with only five new films being released in the entire month, and only three new films scheduled for release in November. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When asked about his views on new Chinese movies, he said: &quot;There are not many Chinese movie scripts that are qualified. Some movies are obviously script-problems. They require a lot of investment and effort, but the foundation is not good.&quot; Okay. The script is the foundation of the movie. If this foundation is not solid, the movie will definitely not be exciting.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;I finished college in a movie theater&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You used to study art. You first entered Xi&#39;an Film Studio as an art artist. How did you later transform into a film screenwriter? ? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Lu Wei: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;In the beginning, I did not prepare to be a screenwriter in my life plan and ideals. Later I came into contact with movies and also worked in film art. One day I suddenly realized that script writing is also a kind of plastic art, which is connected with fine art. I used to paint with colors, but now I paint with words. The principle is the same. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It was completely by chance that I entered Xiying Film Factory. When I was recruiting workers, I was told that there was such a company that was recruiting people, but the job type was probably a cook. Although I was not willing to be a cook, I thought this unit was good and related to art. I didn’t know anything about movies at that time, but I just thought I could get in touch with art, so I joined. I thought to myself that even if I was a cook, I would still have a chance in this unit. As a result, I didn’t even work as a cook for a day. People knew that I could draw. After seeing my paintings, they said, “No problem, you can become an artist.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To do film art, it is inevitable to have to deal with it. to a movie script, because the content of the script determines the content of your work. If you do a lot of art, you will be able to see the problems in the script, how the script should be written, and how to write it is interesting. At that time, there was a so-called youth film crew. All the creative staff, including art and photography, would meet together to discuss the scripts. I often gave comments to some scripts. Later, I made many comments, and sometimes the director used them to provoke me. Fa said, &quot;Then you write and say that this is not good and that is not good, then you can do it yourself.&quot; So I really did it myself. They also felt that the script that was written was better than the original one. This also gave me confidence that the original script could be written. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;The first work for which you were signed as a screenwriter was &quot;The Price of Madness&quot; directed by Zhou Xiaowen &quot;Well, this film was a sensation at the time and was the box office champion in 1988. But this is not the first time you have participated in screenwriting work? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Lu Wei: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;The first one was &quot;They Are Young&quot;, but it failed. Wu Tianming was the director at the time, and he knew that I could write scripts. , pay more attention to me. Later I wrote &quot;The Last Madness&quot;, and that movie was somewhat well-received. It sold for a lot of money. Then I wrote &quot;The Price of Madness&quot;. At this time, I signed my name as the screenwriter. Wu Tianming was very supportive of me. I said, &quot;If you want to be a screenwriter, I will transfer you to the literature department. If you want to be a director, I will transfer you to the directing team. You can tell me what you want to do and I will support you.&quot; After hearing this, I felt that the director of the factory was treating me so favorably. I was very grateful to him, and I said I&#39;d better write a script. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Why did you choose the screenwriter and director?

I think the screenwriter is the designer and the director is the construction engineer. It often happens that the engineer can&#39;t understand the designer&#39;s creativity, so he will change your drawings to what he wants, so the final product may be different from what the designer imagined. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I have been a director and made a film called &quot;The Long Road to Xixia&quot;. I won the Golden Rooster Award for Best Director&#39;s Debut that year and also won several international awards. But I don’t think I’m a good director, and my directing business is not good. My nature is not suitable for being a director, and I really don&#39;t like to direct people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;In recent years, with the progress of the film industry, the importance of screenwriters has Sexuality has gradually come to the fore. In addition to screenwriting majors offered in colleges and universities, screenwriting classes have also begun to appear in society. When you were young, there were few dedicated places to learn screenwriting. How did you improve yourself? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Luwei: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Just watching movies. Movies are different from other things. For science and engineering knowledge, it is best to receive systematic training. Movies are a very intuitive art. You can learn it by watching movies. Through analysis and research, you can become an expert. There is no need to learn. Not to mention attending a film college, I didn’t even have a complete education. I went to the countryside to work as a farmer in a mountain village in Baoji in the second grade of junior high school. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I am lucky because my father works in the People&#39;s Building in Xi&#39;an, which is a reception unit. He is the captain of the automobile team and is responsible for receiving some foreign experts and senior cadres. , so I had the opportunity to watch some foreign movies very early on, such as &quot;Quiet Don&quot;, &quot;Nights of Kabylia&quot;, and &quot;The Bicycle Thieves&quot;... In fact, the cinemas in the 1950s and 1960s were relatively abundant. Yes, it was not until the mid-1960s, when the &quot;Cultural Revolution&quot; was about to begin, that films began to be &quot;one size fits all&quot;. It was not until the late period of the &quot;Cultural Revolution&quot; that some North Korean films began to come in. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When I was making movies, it was still very difficult to watch movies. It gradually improved after 1980, when some foreign movies gradually came in, and it became easier to learn movies at that time. In addition to the convenience of working in the West Film Studio where you can watch some movies, Beijing has begun to hold events such as American Film Week and Spanish Film Week. At that time, a ticket cost about 25 cents, but it didn’t matter that you couldn’t buy it. I could only buy black market tickets, and some movie tickets could be sold for ten yuan. The salary at that time was very low, only thirty-six yuan, but I still wanted to see what I really wanted to see. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are many movies that impressed me deeply, such as &quot;General Patton&quot;, &quot;The Dark Horse&quot;, &quot;Guess Who&#39;s Coming to Dinner&quot;, &quot;Into the Wild&quot;, etc. At that time, I had to take a train from Xi&#39;an to Beijing, and there was no I had extra money to stay in a hotel, so I settled in a friend&#39;s house, and then bought black market tickets every day. &quot;Dark Horse&quot; directed by Ballard is about the friendship between a child and a black horse. I liked it very much and watched it five times in one go. At that time, watching movies was mainly about learning the look of the movie, writing down my thoughts, and building an understanding of the composition of the movie. I completed my college studies in the cinema. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Reading is equally important in your career.

There are more than ten like-minded friends. The conditions for joining That means you have to have a certain level of education and be interested in theory. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We have no organizational form and no name. We just conduct a learning exchange in the name of a gathering of friends. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We read theoretical books, such as &quot;Dialectical Materialism and Historical Materialism&quot; by Ai Siqi. We used it as an outline, discussed it chapter by chapter, and then summarized everyone&#39;s opinions on it. Use your insights. This book was an orthodox book at the time, and there was no danger in studying from it. After the &quot;September 13 Incident&quot;, the central government advocated the study of theory and designated several Marxist-Leninist classics, which we have all systematically read, such as the introduction to &quot;Das Kapital&quot;, &quot;Anti-Dühring&quot; and &quot;Ludwig &quot;Feuerbach and the End of German Classical Philosophy&quot; and &quot;The Communist Manifesto&quot;. In fact, at that time we had already begun to have our own thinking about the social situation and felt that some changes were about to happen. We just didn&#39;t know where this change would lead, so we thought Relying on reading to figure out some problems is our motivation for learning. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;At that time, you were trying to clarify some confusions about your future.

I was studying and studying art at the same time. In order to find books, I also went to the libraries of various universities to steal books. I was discovered later and was detained at the police station for three days. Fortunately, we were lucky. The director was very kind to me. I always felt that the kid who stole the books was because I love reading and asked me to write a promise and go home. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We were in an era of information poverty, an era of extreme blockade, with no information at all.

Because their film composition is the clearest. This may also be a characteristic of Americans, who are relatively simple and direct. After studying, it comes to actual combat. Writing scripts means writing one after another, constantly moving towards new goals. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You have repeatedly emphasized that &quot;Farewell My Concubine&quot; should be written Genre film, does this have anything to do with its huge investment?

I remember when I first started writing the script, Wu Tianming told me how much a certain play would cost and not to overwrite it. Later, Peter Chan asked me to adapt Ha Jin&#39;s &quot;Waiting&quot;. My first question was how much to invest. This is a habit of mine. Later, he said there was no limit, so I started writing. Although the story is a small story, my The background is a big scene. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;&quot;Farewell My Concubine&quot; is also adapted from a novel. In this book, you and Wang Tianbing analyzed the differences between the novel and the script, and you still think that the original novel is second-rate. Why do you think so? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Lu Wei: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I don’t think this is a classic novel, just a common romance novel. Chen Kaige once came to me In a letter, he talked about his wish for us to read the text of the novel again. The original author later published a new version of the novel based on the movie. Even so, the movie and the novel are still different in many places. The ending is very different, and many characters are newly added by us. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Cheng Dieyi and Duan Xiaolou in the novel We finally met in Hong Kong, but your ending was that Cheng Dieyi committed suicide.

I hope that every detail and scene in the movie &quot;Farewell My Concubine&quot; Provenance. For example, the character Yuan Siye, when he was shot at the end in the movie, he walked towards the execution ground with dramatic steps. That was the real story of the execution of a &quot;drama tyrant&quot; named Gao in Wuhan. The scene in which Cheng Dieyi was criticized comes from the past when people from the literary and art circles paraded through the Imperial Academy in Beijing during the Cultural Revolution. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;How long did you prepare for this script?

For research, I had to travel everywhere, including the reference room of the Northern Kunqu Opera Theatre, the Opera Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Arts, the library of Peking University, and the Beijing Library (now the National Library). I rented a room in a hotel next to the library. I went to the library every night and took a notebook to copy information. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The movie was shot very well in the end. The regret is that some details can still be refined and some academic research can be done.

For example, in the novel &quot;Alive&quot;, Fugui&#39;s son died by drawing blood. In reality, this is too rare. There is a problem with the audience&#39;s acceptance. The writing is a bit cruel and beyond our life experience, so I changed it to a car accident. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Judging from the ending, &quot;Alive&quot; finally gave People hope that it is not as cruel as the original work, and seems to be more tender than &quot;Farewell My Concubine&quot;? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Lu Wei: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;This movie is about family life. The style is a little different, but the quality of the two is the same. I should have written &quot;Alive&quot; shortly after I finished writing &quot;Farewell My Concubine&quot;. The origin is that I previously collaborated with Zhang Yimou on a film about Shaanxi shadow puppetry, and he also went to pick up the location. Later, he saw &quot;Alive&quot; and told me to do this first. I also liked this novel, so I agreed. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I made a documentary about old Shaanxi artists performing shadow puppetry. Zhang Yimou liked it very much and found it particularly charming. He watched the film at my house and was very excited. He stayed at my house that night. , we chatted all night and said that we must put shadow puppetry on the screen, and then we put this element into &quot;Alive&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Let him become a living person&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>; Do you think that period was considered a better time for Chinese films? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Lu Wei: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Of course, the policy is relatively loose, and the filmmakers also have a very fighting spirit. Everyone was willing to unite and make a good movie. At that time, personal demands seemed to be gone, and they just wanted to make a good movie. The desire for fame and fortune is relatively weak, and the movie has not begun to be marketed. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the filming of &quot;Farewell My Concubine&quot; was completed, Chen Kaige asked me to go to Beijing, so I went. He said that he had set up a company. I&#39;m a little skeptical about this, because when you set up a company, your motives are not necessarily so pure, and you have pressure, unlike in the system. I said something that maybe he didn’t understand. I said, “I don’t think so if you run a company. I think you’ll be hurt.” In fact, I meant that doing art wouldn’t be so pure in this way. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, I am willing to continue to cooperate with him after that. He was going to shoot &quot;Feng Yue&quot; and asked me to be the screenwriter. When I saw that it was about the &quot;Demolition of the White Party&quot; in Shanghai, I decided to do it. I went to Shanghai to do research and wanted to find out what was going on. After I went to the Shanghai Research Institute of Literature and History to read the information, I found that there was no &quot;explosion of the White Party&quot; in history, so I was unwilling to write this script. Only if I believe it can I write a script. If I don&#39;t believe it, I can&#39;t write it. After I talked to Chen Kaige, he asked me if I could fictionalize it, and I said I couldn&#39;t do that. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, I persuaded him at the time that &quot;Farewell My Concubine&quot; had been successful. Could we make a movie with a small investment but that we really wanted to make?

They are relatively unfamiliar with drama. What they study in school are all works of art and they admire It is also a work of art, and no effort has been made to the plot.

I think Red Cliff is a battlefield and a struggle, while he thinks the theme is peace. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I had a very unpleasant quarrel with the director while filming &quot;White Deer Plain&quot;. He did not understand the theme of &quot;White Deer Plain&quot; and thought it was the relationship between man and land. But I think this book is about the father. The struggle with Zi is a conflict between two generations.

Do you feel regretful? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Lu Wei: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>; I just finished writing a script about the history of the Hetao area. It is a story about a swordsman from the Qing Dynasty, called &quot;The Legend of the Seven Stars of the Swordsman&quot; . I have always had a special liking for martial arts films, and I also like Hetao folk songs. I just wanted to make a martial arts film with singing. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You have always paid attention to new films, and you have often done so before. Review some new movies. What do you think of the recently released domestic films? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Lu Wei: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;It was good to shoot &quot;The Myth of Love&quot; in Shanghai, but it also had its problems. For example, the three female characters are too beautiful and do not look like people from the market. They look like movie characters at first glance. There is also a problem with the image of the male protagonist. He is a good old man, too conceptual and a bit simple. From my understanding of good old people, they are not that simple. These take away from the dramatic power of the film, but the story is good. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;When you create movie characters, how do you let them A more believable character? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Lu Wei: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;You have to understand him and put the character into a real life scene. Don’t conceptualize, don’t simplify, don’t flatten, let him be a living person, a person with emotions, a soul, and emotional appeal. We often have misunderstandings when photographing heroes. Heroes all have emotions and desires. Truth, goodness and beauty, only truth can be good and beautiful. Some movies always make people unconvincing, but they are just not true. Such movies cannot be made by sycophants. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;In recent years, theme-themed movies have once again become an important movie phenomenon, can you write the main melody movie? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Luwei: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Yes, I have written two. There is also a main theme in the greatest movie of all time, namely Eisenstein&#39;s &quot;Battleship Potemkin&quot;. This is the Soviet main theme and was later regarded as the masterpiece of montage theory. I have always been unconvinced. In fact, my parents are old Eighth Route Army soldiers. I think the main theme can be filmed. Unfortunately, the two films I wrote myself were not filmed. I still want to film them if I have the opportunity in the future. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Among the recent movies, you seem to be very optimistic about &quot; &quot;I&#39;m not the god of medicine&quot;, what&#39;s the reason? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Luwei: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;It has far-reaching social significance. Difficulty in getting medical treatment is the common aspiration of the whole society. This movie happened to reveal this problem, so I think it has social significance. From an artistic point of view, this movie can continue to be refined, but this movie has extraordinary significance. Good movies, such as &quot;The Crow and the Sparrow&quot; and &quot;Small Town Spring&quot; have profound social significance. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 03 Oct 2023 23:25:05 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[天成奇峡：云蒸霞蔚的“世外密境”]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257605]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-03 22:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;获取更多RSS：&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 03 Oct 2023 22:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[“失去对身边美好的感知”：社交媒体还是我们自己的问题？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258048]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-03 21:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Recently, Yan Fei, a professor of sociology at Tsinghua University, said: Social media brings people far away, but we But I lost my perception of the beauty around me. This remark triggered a lot of discussion, with both praise and criticism. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One criticism says that experts from the pan-humanistic society tend to fall into reflection on &quot;new technologies&quot; and &quot;new trends&quot;, giving people a sense of criticizing for the sake of criticizing. However, this does not mean that Yan Fei’s statement has no value. Whether it inspires resonance or triggers refutation, it shows that it has touched many people and must be right. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What exactly has social media brought to us? Is it empowering us, allowing us to better control our lives, helping us contact and discover the larger world, and achieving better selves? Or is it going too far and consuming us, and we are being included and swallowed, becoming this &quot;superorganism&quot; &quot;Human flesh input and output terminal, everyone produces fragments, and is fed fragments? The answer may be different for everyone. Different views on a technology can reveal its different aspects. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From a positive perspective, social media has indeed reduced the cost of communication. You can establish links with strangers in distant places without leaving home and just inputting and clicking a few times, sharing your opinions with each other and getting timely feedback; Moreover, in the online world, everyone can take off the mask they wear in real life and reveal their true self without worrying too much about offending others with their honesty. Some people will unite into a community based on common knowledge background, values ​​or hobbies, find an ecological niche that suits them, and find the meaning of survival. For those who feel lonely and out of tune with the people around them offline, it is also a kind of happiness to find that &quot;I am not alone&quot; online. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, with the deepening popularity of mobile Internet and smartphones, more and more freelancers can work from home or even anywhere, especially for knowledge workers. For these people, social media is already an infrastructure for doing work, or a productivity tool. Others’ criticism and reflection on social media are just clouds and noise to them. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So, barring a massive catastrophe, it is impossible for us to return to the state of things before social media for long. In this sense, all criticisms and reflections on social media are irrational and fleeting, while those that are reasonable can at best promote the improvement of social media. Of course, each of us is free to choose, and can independently decide the frequency and type of social media use, and the appropriate proportion and time of online and offline life. Therefore, we cannot treat our mental weakness and disability as Blame it on social media or something else. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Under this general premise, we may admit that Yan Fei’s statement sees a problem. Of course, what appears to be social media’s problem is actually our own problem. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A netizen said, &quot;I feel very close to my heart&quot;. He said that he likes to watch the dusk of vegetation and other things captured in the video, but he doesn&#39;t want to see it in real life. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course life that is staged or filtered is not real life. You have a choice. You can put down your phone and go for a hike to watch the sunrise or watch the sunset on your balcony. Connect with the real world and real people and feel the beauty around you. You can also keep your phone in your hand. The algorithm will continuously push content to you based on your needs and desires, keeping you high until you feel dizzy, exhausted, and left with a sense of consumption and emptiness afterwards. Of course, you can also use your phone sparingly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Originally, you want to accompany your children to enhance the understanding and relationship between parents and children, or go outdoors with family and friends on weekends to enjoy a quiet time. But if you pick up your mobile phone, turn into a heroic fighter on social media, and scold Fang Qiu, then you may have really ignored the people around you who need care and &quot;lost the perception of the beauty around you.&quot; But as long as you step away, social media is just a dead thing to you, and a responsible person will not shirk his responsibilities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another netizen retorted: If there is beauty around us, do we still have time to use social media? Don’t we all just want to get rid of the chicken feathers around us and find our fantasy world through social media? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Properly withdrawing from real life, relaxing and letting yourself go is harmless and beneficial. The way of civility and martial arts is to relax. However, escaping from real life is not advisable. You cannot live a failed life in the real world and become a great hero in the virtual world. Those who &quot;abandon treatment&quot; in the real world will find it difficult to &quot;resurrect with full health&quot; in the virtual world. If the virtual world becomes an anesthetic for you to escape from real life, it will only amplify and intensify your failures in real life. Every time you log off the Internet and return to reality, you will face endless spiritual emptiness. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Needless to say, real life means daily necessities, responsibilities and pressure. We can take a break from stress, but eventually we have to face it. It is better to face it sooner rather than later. The vast majority of parents cannot support you for a lifetime, and the idea of ​​&quot;full-time children&quot; is just self-deception. A person&#39;s growth, a person&#39;s spiritual growth into a qualified adult, fundamentally lies in stimulating one&#39;s inner motivation and courage, using one&#39;s natural talents and acquired abilities, claiming one&#39;s own responsibilities, and doing one&#39;s own business. If you take it up, the reward is the unparalleled sense of accomplishment when you accomplish something, and a mentally stronger self. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For the vast majority of people who need to fight in the real world, social media should be an adjuvant and snack, not an anesthetic and a meal. From the perspective of receiving effective information, social media should not be fully committed to delivery. Some social media have reached the pinnacle of deliberately creating &quot;information cocoons&quot;. For the same news event or hot post, the comment areas for men and women can be completely different to accurately cater to your thoughts, or to be precise. How can you not be afraid of controlling your cognition? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In short, what social media brings to you, whether you dominate it or it dominates you, fundamentally depends on your independent choice and how you use it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 03 Oct 2023 21:25:04 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
