Throughout the 19th century, old Russian literature and painting gradually entered the golden age. Tolstoy to Repin is the intersection of literature and painting.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is a &quot;long-planned&quot; exhibition. The coordination and communication work alone lasted more than four years, with many gaps in between. After an epidemic, these precious works were finally officially unveiled on November 11, 2023 in Wuzhen, a water town in the south of the Yangtze River. In order to borrow the exhibition, Chen Danqing contacted the Moscow State Leo Tolstoy Museum in 2018. In a letter to the director, he wrote: At my age, I have no chance to meet Tolstoy himself, but When I write to you now, I feel like I am writing to Tolstoy...&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23 /11/29/rIqziyHN4h8Rx2pAZxCBw7YjwpIED9AfqFGoOHPM.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;634&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/rIqziyHN4h8Rx2pAZxCBw7YjwpIED9Afq FGoOHPM .jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;259999&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&quot;Tolstoy in the Plowed Field&quot; (copied from Repin&#39;s original work), published Oil painting, Andreev Vladimir Ivanovich, 1887, collection: State Leo Tolstoy Museum&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;When Repin met Lev&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Chen Danqing said that Mu Xin keeps three or five pictures of world literary figures on his desk all year round, including Tuo Weng. Mu Xin was sincerely convinced of Russian literature and Tolstoy. He once said enviously: Look, that big bearded book is densely packed with literature. But as a painter, Mu Xin looked down on Russian paintings, including Repin. &quot;His paintings are deeply hidden in the world of Fan Kuan and Ni Zan, and he was impatient with the cumbersomeness and complexity of Russian paintings.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;But for me This is another kind of experience. I started reading Tolstoy and copying Repin when I was 13 years old. I never imagined that one day I would be able to see their original works and invite their original works to Wuzhen to share them with everyone. For me Said, this is a very special exhibition.&quot; Chen Danqing said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For generations of Chinese readers, the name Leo Tolstoy carries considerable weight and carries a lot of imagination. He is a &quot;monster in the history of world literature.&quot; In the minds of many people, Tolstoy looks like a tall and tall man, including Repin. When Repin saw Tolstoy for the first time in 1880 in the Bolshoi Alley in Moscow, he was startled and realized that he had been deceived by the pictures and portraits he had seen in the past. He always thought that Tolstoy was a tall noble count, but the Tolstoy in front of him looked like a weirdo and preacher, short and stocky, but with a huge head! He has a beautiful gray beard and wears a long black dress. Repin, who was proficient in painting, soon realized that it was this huge head that made Tolstoy appear tall and burly in portraits - people would judge his height from the usual head-to-body ratio. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Rebin also played with the same optical illusion. His Tolstoy still gives people the impression of being tall and towering, coupled with the deep, ascetic expression on his face , to create a sense of moral loftiness. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tolstoy left a deep impression on Repin when they met for the first time. Repin later recalled the situation when they met: Tolstoy said excitedly like a speech throughout the whole process. What are you talking about, denouncing the tragedy of injustice in life and people&#39;s consistent indifference. This strange eccentric was also a staunch preacher. &quot;He spoke in a deep, sincere voice... He was excited about something and was in a bad mood. There was a sad tone in his voice. Under the formidable thick eyebrows, there was a serious and penitent expression. Eyes flashing green.&quot; The writer&#39;s strong personality and extremely radical remarks made Repin feel fresh and creepy, &quot;as if we were on the eve of the final judgment.&quot; When he went home that night, he had insomnia. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/Q2Uhm806kb5oJ7cXTOAtYV5hLNEMcpTyuiDnybzH.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;691&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/Q2Uhm806kb5oJ7cXTOAtYV5hLNEMcpTyuiDnybzH.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;259998&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Tolstoy and Repin sitting in armchairs in the hall of Yasnaya Polyana House, photo, Sofia Andreyevna Tolstoy , 1908, Collection: State Leo Tolstoy Museum&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The Count who is keen on plowing fields&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Curator Wo from the Moscow State Leo Tolstoy Museum Volosevich Olesia said that when Repin and Tolstoy first met, Tolstoy was nearly 50 years old and Repin was only 35 years old. The achievements can basically be equated with Tolstoy&#39;s achievements in literature, but in the first 10 years of their acquaintance, Repin looked up to Tolstoy as if he were looking up to God. Repin once said: Everything Tolstoy said should be engraved in gold.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ten years after Repin met Tolstoy, he got the opportunity to paint Tolstoy. In 1891, when Repin came to the Polyana Manor where Tolstoy lived, he saw that Tolstoy had become a complete civilian. This count, one of the best in the province, no longer wore formal clothes. He was wearing a black shorts and trousers made of rough and worn fabric. He wore a badly worn white skullcap on his head and wore slippers on his bare feet. But Repin found his appearance even more awe-inspiring than before. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tolstoy did not like his private life to be disturbed, nor did he like to have his portrait painted, except for Repin, because Repin was a good friend of his eldest daughter Tatiana. Tatiana herself was an artist, loved painting, and was deeply influenced by Repin. They maintained frank correspondence and friendship for a long time. Tolstoy tolerated Repin painting from his family estate. At first, it was entirely to give face to his beloved daughter, but later, Repin won his approval. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is precisely because of this recognition that Repin was able to contribute an image of Tolstoy other than a literary giant that the world has never seen before: a man who skillfully used a sword and a lasso to drive away the horse gangs. Widow farmer plowing fields. Farm work was Tolstoy&#39;s best entertainment and relaxation - it is said that every time Tolstoy returned to the dining table after farm work, the mud on his legs and the smell of horse manure on his body made the whole family secretly complain, and his wife Sofia would She complained that he ruined her fine carpet and had to open the windows to ventilate the smell so that it would not affect the family&#39;s meal. While Repin was sketching for him, he clearly noticed that the passing farmers and village women expressed puzzlement and sarcastic smiles about the count&#39;s plowing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Rebin asked to try plowing. He soon lost the battle. His painter&#39;s hands were unable to cope with the heavy farm work. Repin was very diligent and worked almost all the time at Polyana Manor. He never thought that he was a genius and believed that everything he did was based on hard work. &quot;He didn&#39;t want to waste a minute and was working every moment. He said that I had such a great opportunity and was so close to Tolstoy that I should spend every minute portraying the image of this master.&quot; Lecia said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/FZCTmHWphh1kB6RCDH0OQOH6MhhcubbYYICfaSBf.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;747&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/FZCTmHWphh1kB6RCDH0OQOH6MhhcubbYYICfaSBf.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;259997&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Special exhibition &quot;Tolstoy in Repin&#39;s Works&quot; at Muxin Art Museum, handwritten letters from Tolstoy and Repin&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>; (Provided by interviewee/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Bathing together and praying together&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;It was this kind of personal companionship that allowed Repin to draw Thor working in the fields. Tolstoy, Tolstoy writing in his study, Tolstoy with his family, Tolstoy listening to music, Tolstoy participating in the census, Tolstoy with the poor , Tolstoy in prayer... What is particularly precious is that Tolstoy usually did not let anyone see him praying alone in the forest, but Repin captured this moment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tolstoy allowed Repin to walk two miles with him to take a bath in a very cold river. As soon as he walked out of the courtyard, Tolstoy would take off his old homemade slippers and walk very fast with bare feet. The branches and gravel on the path could not help his calloused feet. Repin had to hurry up and walk slowly. Follow his footsteps. After marching for two miles, they were already sweating profusely when they reached the river. Repin suggested sitting for a quarter of an hour to sweat, and immediately jumping into the ice water would cause you to catch a cold. But Tolstoy had quickly stripped off his clothes and jumped into the river. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;This is all prejudice, nothing will happen.&quot; Towen said as he stuck his huge head out of the ice water. Before Repin finished sweating, Tolstoy had already taken a shower, put on his clothes, picked up a basket and went to pick mushrooms. His figure disappearing into the forest left an extraordinary impression on Repin: &quot;He looked like a homeless man carrying a basket in the woods, but also had the air of a soldier&quot; - Repin wrote in his later memoirs . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Every time he was in the woods, Tolstoy asked a person to step away for a while. He told Repin that he would stand alone in the deep forest and pray. This kind of monk-like spiritual practice would often pass by without even realizing it. Finally, Repin plucked up the courage and asked if he could hide behind the bushes and sketch his long prayers. He was prepared to be flatly rejected. But Tolstoy said kindly: &quot;Ah, there is nothing immoral about this. And when it comes to using me for painting, I am now like a girl who has lost her virginity and shame. I will not refuse anyone who comes. That&#39;s the thing, no.&quot; Relationship! Paint as long as you need it.&quot; By this point, Repin had completely won Tolstoy&#39;s trust. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the exhibition hall, you can see this painting of Tolstoy in prayer. From the initial sketch to the final oil painting, Repin painted it for a full 10 years. Tolstoy in the painting is as beautiful as Wearing a white robe, barefoot, with his hands in his belt, his expression was solemn and solemn like an ascetic monk. In his pocket, there was a thick book with a red cover. It was unclear whether it was the Bible or not. Tolstoy firmly believed that believers should have real communication with God on a regular basis instead of being rigid in rituals. He denied the superficial rituals of the Orthodox Church. When Repin was finally able to exhibit this painting &quot;Tolstoy Praying&quot; in 1906, Tolstoy was expelled from the religious committee by the Orthodox Church because his views were not in line with the teachings. People who came to the exhibition and young people Students laid flowers around the portrait of Tolstoy who was praying alone, silently expressing their support for Tolstoy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/Y2J1xeElcFjOqQOcDaBbynytPBvfRbV6kPwze542.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;712&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/Y2J1xeElcFjOqQOcDaBbynytPBvfRbV6kPwze542.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;260000&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&quot;Tolstoy on the Other Side of Life&quot;, oil on canvas, Repin, 1912, collection: State Leo Tolstoy Museum&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;He Drawing Tolstoy after his death&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Rebin played an important role in promoting Tolstoy’s image to the world. It is precisely because of him that Tolstoy’s appearance appeared in Russia He became a well-known icon in many daily necessities: calendars, covers, prints, and even chocolate wrappers... Tolstoy was initially suspicious of the large-scale dissemination of his portrait, and especially disapproved of exposing himself plowing the fields, but Finally he gave in. He said to Repin: I respect your opinion, after all, you are a great painter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What’s interesting is that Repin wrote many times in his memoirs how contagious Tolstoy’s smile was and how high-spirited and happy he was when galloping on his horse. But in his writing, There is no portrait of Tolstoy with a smile. He always has a serious, staring, introspective and profound face. It seems that this is the face of Tolstoy&#39;s spirit. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1907, Repin once again returned to Polyana Manor and met Tolstoy in his twilight years. This year Tuo Weng is 79 years old and can still ride a horse and run wildly. Repin once again painted him. This important portrait, completed in 1909, almost freezes for us the last appearance of Tolstoy during his lifetime. He was sitting in a pink armchair. His beard and hair were white, his face was majestic, simple and solemn, his eyes were distant and almost transparent, and he seemed to have seen things that mortals could not see. Repin did not draw the piano next to Tolstoy, nor did he draw the person playing the piano. His Tolstoy may be listening to music, or he may just be immersed in his own world through music. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is how Repin described Tolstoy&#39;s appearance in the last years of his life: &quot;looks like a Scythian chief&quot;, &quot;an unshakable look - a living statue of the Stone Age&quot;, &quot;How strange! High cheekbones, a rough nose chopped by an ax and a chisel, a long unkempt beard, big ears...the eyebrows on the eyes are like carapace, the appearance is majestic and terrifying, majestic. However, this chief and his followers They have long since destroyed any tools for the promotion of violence, and their arms are only the docile belief in defending a peaceful life and a free spirit.&quot; Lev Nikolayevich (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: italics, italics_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Tolstoy&lt;/span>;) himself showed with his own personality and complexion that the spirit has triumphed over the selfish desires of life. His eyes shine with the bright light of this victory.&quot; &quot;He understands everything and forgives everything. .&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this period, Tolstoy, with his selfless love for the poor and his thoughts on social injustice, was preparing for the liberation of the serfs, dispersing his family wealth and finally running away. Repin felt that it was precisely because of his long-term communication with God that this old man, who was once full of frightening passion, became calm in the last stage of his life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;You have to pay attention to these two paintings, this portrait (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;&quot;Tolstoy sitting in a pink armchair&quot; &quot;&lt;/span>;) was painted by Repin a year before Tolstoy&#39;s death. After Tolstoy&#39;s death, he painted another ( ;&quot;>;&quot;Tolstoy on the Other Side of Life&quot;&lt;/span>;), Tolstoy is in heaven, Tolstoy went to see God.&quot; Chen Danqing pointed to the two most eye-catching masterpieces in the exhibition hall, and Between these two masterpieces hangs Repin&#39;s self-portrait. &quot;In this exhibition hall, when you stare at Repin, please note that more than a hundred years ago, this painter was staring at the great Tolstoy.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Two paintings are far apart in the exhibition hall, on the left The pink armchair, corresponding to the pink flowers on the right, Tolstoy stood in the pink glow, standing with his hands down, as if he had confessed everything to God and the world, the light of heaven reflected on his face, a picture The face is not human, it is old, but it is new again. Among all Tolstoy&#39;s paintings by Repin, there has never been one with so many dazzling bright colors. Tolstoy stared at the sky in the brightness and once again saw things that we cannot see. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sketch, sketch, sketch repeatedly, and then create oil paintings based on the sketch. Before that, this was Repin&#39;s path to realist painting. A series of small drafts and sketches about Tolstoy in Polyana cross-corroborated this faithful path. This is also the path of Russian painting and Russian literature. However, there is no evidence that Tolstoy posed for the portrait &quot;Tolstoy on the Other Side of Life&quot; during his lifetime. The realist master Repin lost his model after his death, but in the end he painted the appearance of Tolstoy&#39;s soul. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 04 Dec 2023 10:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[重庆检察机关依法对焦小平涉嫌受贿案提起公诉]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261795]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-12-04 10:07:08&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;The reporter learned from the Supreme People’s Procuratorate today (4th) that the former Party Committee Standing Committee and Deputy Commander of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps The case of Jiao Xiaoping, former deputy general manager of China New Construction Group Corporation, suspected of accepting bribes, was investigated and concluded by the National Supervisory Commission.

The filming scene at the entrance of a hotel in Hengdian showed a male actor slapping an actress. Southern Weekend reporter Zhao Mingshe&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Notice - when the news of the rectification of micro-short dramas came, freelance screenwriter Deng Zhuye had just returned to Dali from a visit to Hengdian. She received a reminder from the creator&#39;s WeChat group. Realize the seriousness of the problem: you cannot be careless and must take it seriously. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Experiencing the critical moment of this industry, while she was adjusting the script urgently, she could still feel that the entire short drama market was still booming. &quot;Everything is lacking, and the producers keep asking me to recommend writers.&quot; Deng Zhuye said that the country&#39;s introduction of governance measures shows that the market size of short dramas has begun to receive attention from the outside world. &quot;If it can be regulated in the future, it can develop for a long time, which is a good thing.&quot; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the morning of November 15, 2023, the China Online Audiovisual Program Service Association published an article stating that the State Administration of Radio, Film and Television will once again launch a month-long special rectification of online micro-short dramas. This series of rectifications has exposed a secret but flourishing cultural industry to public view: in 2021, the number of micro-short dramas registered throughout the year was 398, and in 2022 the number was close to 2,800, an increase of 600%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Special rectification has pressed the pause button on the chaotic and barbaric situation, but the entire industry is still in the stage of rapid development of &quot;go big and go fast&quot;. While producers are adjusting scripts and standardizing content, some big directors, big actors and big companies are also actively participating in the short drama industry, and the pace of entering overseas sinking markets is also advancing rapidly. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;Shady maids&quot; are not allowed&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In fact, the competent authorities have carried out multiple rounds of rectification. According to media reports, starting from late November 2022, the State Administration of Radio, Film and Television will use a concentrated period of three months to organize and carry out special rectification work on online micro-short dramas. As of February 28, 2023, a total of pornographic, vulgar, bloody, violent, and low-style dramas have been offline. There are more than 25,300 micro-short dramas with content such as aesthetics, vulgarity, etc., &quot;forming a deterrent effect and effectively curbing the barbaric growth of online micro-short dramas.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Recently, the short drama industry has ushered in another wave of rectification. On November 16, Douyin announced that it had recently removed 119 illegal micro-short dramas in its mini-programs, and dealt with 1,188 Douyin accounts that illegally promoted micro-short dramas. On November 18, WeChat had removed illegal micro-short dramas from its mini-programs. There were 114 short plays, and 163 mini-program accounts were dealt with for publishing micro-short plays in serious violation of regulations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Those themes that are more sensitive are definitely subject to great restrictions, such as time travel and extreme revenge.&quot; Lu Liwen&#39;s company is located in Shijiazhuang, Hebei Province, and she has also stepped into this trend and started making short plays. She is a screenwriter. , because the company&#39;s business has developed too fast, the transformation is responsible for &quot;receiving the script&quot;. The country has introduced new policies that have a direct impact on its business. For example, she said that popular &quot;story synopses&quot; such as &quot;The Dark Maid&quot; will no longer be allowed. &quot;Adjustments should be made according to the requirements of radio and television. It is not so easy to publish a story that is too old.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She told Southern Weekend reporters that the short dramas on the market are basically the same and not particularly eye-catching. A story that shines before your eyes, &quot;bound in a system.&quot; The themes of short plays mainly focus on several categories such as boss, romance, and son-in-law. Lu Liwen said that due to market and increasingly strict regulatory considerations, people generally do not dare to make new attempts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As a result, the short drama market, which is already highly homogeneous, has become more crowded with themes. In order to avoid this problem, they will cast a wide net and select the best among the same types of themes. &quot; If we can accept 100 books, we will basically sign about 10 with the same theme, and then we will not accept any more.&quot; Lu Liwen said that if the project is major, she will also go with the team to modify the lines according to the scene. Temporary changes to the play to make it more realistic. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;(The rectification) mainly targets vulgar content such as bloody violence and pornography.&quot; Mr. Huang is a producer of a film and television company in Zhejiang. He is known as &quot;Brother Hua&quot; in the circle. He is stationed in Hengdian all year round to film with the team. . He recalled to Southern Weekend reporters that the rise of short dramas has a certain relationship with the epidemic. The impact of the epidemic on the traditional film and television industry is well known, and the past few years have been a period of rapid development of short video platforms, and the short drama genre was born. During this period, there was no clear requirement for registration when shooting vertical screen short dramas, so all kinds of dramas with exaggerated and uninformed plots became chaotic and expanded. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He called the short drama market during this period the first stage of barbaric growth. &quot;I&#39;m telling you now clearly what can and cannot be photographed.&quot; Hua Ge said that in fact, national supervision has never been interrupted, and his company&#39;s business lines have also been adjusted. In his view, short plays, like movies, TV series, and &quot;online movies&quot;, are a cultural product designed to meet the spiritual needs of the audience. The introduction of policies to standardize development will help improve the production level and &quot;clear out those Low quality stuff”. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, the barbaric growth in the barbaric period will reach its final climax in November 2023. On November 16, the paid mini-series &quot;Black Lotus&#39;s Advancement Manual&quot; was launched. According to media reports, the paid amount reached 20 million yuan within 24 hours of its launch, and its ability to attract money is staggering. This micro-short drama with the theme of revenge of a concubine has a fast pace and many twists and turns. It is regarded as a combination of &quot;The Legend of Zhen Huan&quot; and &quot;Story of Yanxi Palace&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, less than a week after its launch, the show was removed from the shelves by multiple platforms for &quot;exaggerating the bad values ​​of extreme revenge and using violence to counter violence&quot; and &quot;confused the concepts of right and wrong.&quot; Around this time, a new round of special rectification was unveiled, and the short drama market bid farewell to its first stage of rapid growth, which was barbaric and disorderly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;The filming scene of a short play in Hengdian.

Photo by Southern Weekend reporter Zhao Ming&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;You can kneel when you get married, but not housekeepers&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The SARFT’s rectification work on online micro-short dramas involves seven aspects, including accelerating the formulation of &quot;Internet micro-short dramas&quot; &quot;Short Drama Creation, Production and Content Review Rules&quot;, and micro-short dramas containing pornographic and vulgar content, bloody violence, low style, vulgar aesthetics, etc. will be offline. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Squatting in the WeChat group all day long, Deng Zhuye constantly asked for advice from his predecessors to understand the spirit of the document, &quot;For example, the notice said not to kneel down at all times, which is promoting feudal ideology.&quot; So, what kind of kneeling is reasonable? A novice screenwriter raised this question in the group. A mature screenwriter who has been in the industry for two or three years analyzed that paying homage to the dead and ancestors, as well as the marriage plot of costume dramas, are all legitimate needs for kneeling. &quot;However, in the Ba Zong drama, the eldest young master asked the housekeeper to kneel down, which is obviously not allowed.&quot; Deng Zhuye explained that the policy is not one-size-fits-all and needs to be reasonably arranged according to the plot. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The rectification work mainly focuses on the content. If you understand the spirit of the policy, it is not difficult to comply with the regulations. &quot;I stayed up all night and kept revising the script.&quot; After repeated self-examination and self-correction, Deng Zhuye deleted all the money involved in his script or changed it to imaginary numbers to eliminate the possibility of &quot;showing off wealth.&quot; She said that the producer is currently only requesting changes to the draft, and has not rejected the draft or reduced the supply due to reduced demand. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Deng Zhuye is a fan of Yu Hua and Mo Yan. At the same time, she maintains the habit of reading Western classics. She often reads &quot;La Traviata&quot; and &quot;Anna Karenina&quot;. She loves literature and writing. I hope to write my own serious literature in the future. But now, she had to follow the production company&#39;s revisions and push herself to move forward. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After a period of observation, in the view of 24-year-old &quot;Hengdiao&quot; actor Xing Jialin, the industry rectification is &quot;good news&quot; for herself, &quot;at least the requirements for &#39;bordering&#39; are much less.&quot; The so-called borderline refers to a kind of soft pornography, which is a vague area between platform bans and non-bans. In order to attract people&#39;s attention, some directors will set up some nudity scenes. Relatively speaking, the salary of side actors will be much higher than that of regular actors. &quot;If you don&#39;t do side work, it will be 300 yuan a day. If you do side work, it will be 700 to 800 yuan a day.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The crew once gave Xing Jialin a low-cut sling to play a female prisoner. Sometimes, intimate scenes will be added temporarily. She believed that these scenes were just for the sake of edging and had nothing to do with the needs of the plot, so she instinctively resisted. &quot;Actually, the scale of the scene is not too big, and the intimate scenes are also performed in different places, but I just feel disgusted.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xing Jialin has a background in acting, so she will figure out how to improve her acting skills. However, when it comes to short play sets, it’s often a one-step process, and there’s no time for the actors to memorize their lines. “Just give a rough idea on the spot.” &quot;Micro-expressions and movement details are all cut off.&quot; She said that in one scene, she needs to push the heroine into the water with another character. The normal operation should be that the two people would make eye contact to show their insidiousness and intentions. Ghost fetus, on the set of the short play, these are not needed at all, the director asked to push it directly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xing Jialin receives an average of six or seven short plays every month, and the filming is often completed before she even remembers the title of the play. The busiest time was from 9 a.m. to 6 a.m. the next day. In order to keep up with the schedule, the director asked her not to take off her makeup, so she wore her makeup for three days in the stuffy studio, &quot;shooting right after waking up.&quot; Xing Jialin had previously mainly participated in horizontal-screen film and television dramas, and had roles with lines in two major productions. However, because of her starring role in &quot;Collapse of the House&quot;, both of them could not be broadcast later. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The industry rectification has not stopped the operation of this assembly line. However, Xing Jialin no longer has to worry about whether to wear suspenders or not, and has doubts about her acting career. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;On December 1, 2023, extras rested on the set of the short drama crew.

Photographed by Southern Weekend reporter Zhao Ming&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“Foreigners are also very popular”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In the past half month, the number of manufacturers who have come to inquire about the overseas business of short dramas has suddenly increased. Zhu Haicong realized that the short drama market has reached a new node. &quot;In the past, it was mainly the leading companies that were producing (overseas short plays), but now some small and medium-sized manufacturers are also interested.&quot; He is the manager of a company in Shenzhen that specializes in producing overseas short plays. His experience in just over half a year has made him He couldn&#39;t help feeling that the short drama market was really changing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The export of short plays overseas has become a trend, and industry regulation is intensifying the development of this trend. &quot;The rectification is the direct reason, mainly because the domestic production volume is too high.&quot; Zhu Haicong told Southern Weekend reporters that their company originally mainly undertook the promotion business of domestic brands in overseas markets, and had many shooting resources in Europe and the United States. About half a year ago, companies began to come to me, wanting to film short dramas adapted from online articles. After some market research, their company determined that this was indeed an outlet, and they naturally expanded their business. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Local shooting, a local crew was assembled, and after filming was completed, the crew was disbanded on the spot. Because of years of resource accumulation, Zhu Haicong&#39;s company quickly solved the problem of the shooting team. The core problem was the cultural differences between East and West. &quot;Essentially, short plays are a kind of cultural export, and foreign directors were not very understanding at first.&quot; He recalled that the first short play undertaken by the company told the story of a takeaway boy&#39;s counterattack: The boy discovered that a girl A friend had an affair with a rich second-generation man and was humiliated by him. However, he quickly counterattacked and slapped the &quot;bad couple&quot; in the face. But for such a simple plot, the director couldn&#39;t convey the emotions fully. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“It’s not because the director has no skills, it’s probably because his skills are too high.” He explained that in order to get the feeling of satisfaction after the counterattack, he needed to give many close-ups of the actor’s eyes and expressions when he was being humiliated. , but the foreign director used a lot of medium shots and long shots. &quot;If the camera is not moved properly, the violent conflict cannot be expressed.&quot; Zhu Haicong had to change directors and cinematographers to achieve the effect he was satisfied with. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, there are still strong emotional similarities between Eastern and Western audiences. &quot;Some localization will be done, but the core is the same.&quot; Zhu Haicong said that the Chinese can understand the setting of the delivery boy at a glance, but in North America and Europe, there are not many full-time delivery boys. In comparison, In other words, the story shell of werewolves and vampires is naturally easy for foreigners to understand. However, no matter which type of setting, the core of the story is the boss, revenge, and &quot;foreigners are also very good&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;It&#39;s very strange and outrageous, but it&#39;s also very exciting. I want to know how the story will develop next.&quot; Zhu Haicong said that currently short dramas from China have occupied a place in the Western cultural consumer market. However, the manufacturers that have achieved success are all major companies that have been exporting online content overseas for many years, because the cost of filming short dramas overseas is much higher than in China. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He introduced that in China, two to three hundred thousand yuan can be used to shoot a 100-episode short drama, but in the North American market, the cost of manpower, material resources and venue rental are much higher than in China. The cost of a short play is converted into RMB, which is at least 1 million yuan. This figure is the cost line after the number of filming reaches at least seven or eight, and the cost line is evenly divided, plus operations and promotion, it is at least 10 million yuan or more. Only with the project size can we consider going overseas. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He noticed that more and more short drama manufacturers are waiting to see and participate in going overseas. &quot;This shows that domestic short drama manufacturers are actually developing very fast.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;A short drama filming site in Hengdian.

Photo by Southern Weekend reporter Zhao Ming&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Big capital has entered the market&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Xia Xia (pseudonym) is a screenwriter who has switched from traditional drama series to short dramas. After several content adjustments, She is keenly aware that centralized rectification may be an opportunity for the industry to transition to high-quality products. She explained to Southern Weekend reporters that traditional dramas will also have counterattack plots, but they need to be foreshadowed before and after the counterattack. The plot has main and subplots, and the characters have growth arcs. However, short dramas do not need these foreshadowings, and short dramas need to be in the shortest possible time. Achieving reversal within time, this routine is the &quot;essence&quot; of the short play. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the era of short dramas, the audience’s emotions need “instant gratification”. &quot;It&#39;s just an emotional PPT. The upper and lower PPTs are not very coherent, but they are all OK.&quot; Xia Xia said that the audience does not want to see the protagonist being wronged or insulted. If the heroine is slapped, the heroine&#39;s husband must immediately slap him twice. He returned it and said, &quot;There is no logic, just keep reversing and slapping me in the face.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;You slap me, I slap you. No one likes to write this kind of script all the time, right?&quot; She said that after the industry became standardized, those who were particularly exaggerated, completely brainless, illogical and out of touch The actual drama series will be limited. If big capital comes into the game and attracts better talents to join the industry, the quality of short dramas may also increase. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, the booming short drama market is attracting more and more talents. According to media reports, veteran TVB artists and actors continue to join in the filming of micro-short dramas; and leading Internet platforms have also stopped filming short dramas to seize the market. &quot;The addition of good actors will definitely improve the quality.&quot; Hua Ge said that the addition of a leading platform will have a profound impact on the development of the short drama market. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He introduced that the current main profit model of short dramas is concentrated in the paid viewing stage. In order to get exposure, producers have to &quot;stream&quot; on a large scale on the platform to obtain traffic. This expenditure accounts for a large amount. Big cost. The addition of large companies and large platforms will bring new account sharing models and IP incubation models. Even some brands are in direct contact with short drama producers, and brand-embedded short dramas are also booming. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, large capital parties are increasingly joining this feast. &quot;We are also actively in contact with private equity institutions.&quot; Hua Ge said that the company will promote the filming of multiple short dramas at the same time, and has just completed four of them. Hengdian is also a prosperous scene due to the rise of the short drama market. Because the actors&#39; schedules are tight and there are many plays lined up at the venue, the crew often has to stay up late to catch up. Therefore, the company plans to invest in the construction of two filming studios. Such heavy assets require a large amount of capital investment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Brother Hua and the crew are stationed in Hengdian all year round. He said that once the script and actors are in place, the filming of a short drama can be completed in a week. Earlier, a drama series could be produced with a cost of more than 100,000 yuan, but later it cost about 200,000 to 300,000 yuan. Now, the production cost has reached one million yuan, and dramas worth two million yuan are also appearing in large numbers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 04 Dec 2023 09:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[上海独生女继承两亿遗产被诉离婚？婚姻不应成为财富再分配的工具丨快评]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261768]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-12-03 19:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;November 30, 2023, published by &quot;Shanghai Rule of Law News&quot; The article states: The woman comes from a well-off family and serves as the director of a foreign-funded company; the man is the receptionist at the hotel where the woman’s company’s annual meeting is held. The man violently pursued the woman, and later they got married. After the marriage, the woman&#39;s parents died in a car accident while traveling. Half a year later, the man filed for divorce and requested a division of the woman&#39;s inheritance from her parents. The woman&#39;s parents own nine properties and shops in Shanghai, as well as more than 10 million yuan in bank deposits and financial products, with a total value of about 200 million yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;This article once reached the top of the hot search, with a main tag having more than 600 million views, and popular comments including &quot;I even suspected that the car accident...&quot; You can spend 10 million to deal with it, and I guarantee that the man will not get a dime.&quot; He also accused the man of &quot;taking advantage of the poor&quot;, and in short, scolded him for being shameless. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;This is actually a story told by lawyer Tan Fang. He neither gave a specific timeline nor presented credible evidence including judicial documents. Some netizens discovered that when she shared this story on Zhihu in 2022, she had the label &quot;the content contains fictional creations&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;For this reason, some media interviewed Ma Lei, a partner at Tan Fang&#39;s law firm, who said that the case was real and only involved the client&#39;s privacy. , will fabricate sensitive information such as names. However, it is very common to use pseudonyms in news reports. Journalists only need to mark it in the text or at the end of the article. They will not consider themselves to be &quot;fictional creations&quot; by using pseudonyms. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;In summary, the authenticity of this case is doubtful and needs further confirmation. But the emotions and reactions triggered by this story are real and strong: as can be seen from the massive online comments, the public generally does not agree with and find it difficult to accept the legacy left by the man&#39;s parents and the girl&#39;s parents. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;Moreover, there are indeed such cases in judicial practice. In March this year, the Guangxi High Court issued a property dispute case. In 2021, Zhang and his wife Wang agreed to divorce, and their daughter lived with Wang. On the grounds that Zhang failed to pay child support, Wang filed a post-divorce property dispute lawsuit with the court. During the trial, Wang learned that Zhang’s mother died during the cooling-off period of their divorce and left behind a property. Zhang sold the above-mentioned house, and Wang requested to divide the sales proceeds obtained by Zhang from selling the house. In the end, the court ruled that Zhang should pay more than 2.18 million yuan in the sale price of the house inherited by Wang. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;During the relationship between husband and wife, it is legal for one party to request a division of the parental estate inherited by the other party. The marriage and family section of the current Civil Code stipulates that &quot;property inherited or donated&quot; is the common property of husband and wife and owned jointly by husband and wife (Article 1062). This is the default principle; only when &quot;it is determined in the will or gift contract that only one party will own it&quot; &quot;Property&quot; is the personal property of one spouse (Article 1063). &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;Such provisions in statutory law are intended to expand the scope of joint property between husband and wife, allowing the economically weaker party to have more property to divide in the event of divorce. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;The problem is that when marriage becomes a tool for wealth redistribution, both marriage and wealth become unsafe. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;As far as marriage is concerned, under statutory laws and judicial practices that expand the scope of joint property between husband and wife, if two people with a huge gap in property and income get married, the marriage will become It’s even more unstable because it promotes the stereotype that “marriage is to start a business, divorce is to get rich”. Whether it is adding one&#39;s name to the property before marriage (= giving away half of the property), one of the parents did not make a will and left an inheritance, or one party in the marriage has too strong wealth creation ability or becomes rich overnight, these are only the joint property of the husband and wife during the marriage. One party may not have substantial control and dominance, but as long as there is a divorce, the other party can actually obtain control and dominance of half of the property. If a person obtains a large amount of wealth through divorce, achieves financial freedom, and feels so happy, this will inevitably inspire evil in human nature. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;In terms of wealth, a property in first-tier cities often costs tens of millions, and is often the accumulation of wealth for at least two generations. Just because a marriage certificate costs Losing half of a house is very unfair and makes people who hold real estate in big cities very insecure. Therefore, more and more people ask for a match before getting married, or just hold a wedding without getting a certificate, so as to avoid being &quot;exploited&quot; in the event of divorce. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;Back to the issue of inheritance, it is natural and reasonable for parents to hope that their property will be left to their children or other blood-related descendants a hundred years from now. Consistent with natural law and customary law. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;In the absence of a will and legal inheritance, in accordance with natural law and customary law, the inheritance left by parents to their children should of course be inherited by their children. personal property. However, as mentioned above, current statutory law and judicial practice stipulate that it is joint property of husband and wife by default. If one parent dies suddenly without leaving a will, the greed of the other parent may be aroused. Through divorce, they can divide half of the other parent&#39;s inheritance, achieve financial freedom, and reach the peak of life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;Of course, many people believe in love, and also believe that being economically disadvantaged does not necessarily mean being morally despicable, but don’t test human nature, as long as a certain proportion of economically disadvantaged people can make progress Taking this step is enough to destroy the trust that should exist in marriage and make everyone fear marriage. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;Elderly people who are knowledgeable, educated and understand the law know what to do. Some media reports: Recently, 85-year-old Grandma Liu came to the China Wills Library to make a will and wanted to give her property to The granddaughter, son and daughter-in-law all know and agree. She said she lived a happy life in her later years and was not afraid of making a will. She was once the coach of a modeling team. The consideration is roughly like this: leaving it directly to the son is natural, but the daughter-in-law may be unhappy and complain &quot;you don&#39;t trust me&quot;; leaving the son directly to the granddaughter perfectly solves this problem. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;&quot;China Will Library White Paper (2022)&quot; shows that 99.8% of the elderly who make wills state that the inheritance will be inherited by the children alone and does not belong to the joint property of the heirs. It is the so-called &quot;protection against daughter-in-law and son-in-law&quot; clause. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;In the final analysis, it is all forced by the current statutory law and judicial practice. The elderly have worked hard all their lives to accumulate real estate, and most elderly people cannot accept it psychologically if &quot;outsiders&quot; who are not related by blood and may divorce and leave at any time take away half of the house. However, more elderly people do not have this awareness. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 03 Dec 2023 23:25:05 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[我的父亲母亲丨逝者]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261744]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-12-03 23:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 11/29/TzFsCURKUbpRWt7gkpHYGBoT44F4jGLOalCSSM4m.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/TzFsCURKUbpRWt7gkpHYGBoT44F4jGLOalCSSM 4m. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;260020&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Ma Guoguang (1928-2014) Zhejiang, Judge Zheng Ruyu (1930-2022) Zhejiang, Teacher&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The bulging key bag suddenly became lighter, and the sale of the parents&#39; house was completed. They moved into this apartment in early 2009, and this house carries every bit of their old age. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before his retirement, my father was the vice-president of a district court in Shanghai. He was 1.78 meters tall, handsome in appearance, upright and principled, and full of romantic warmth. Even when he was in pain, he would hold his mother&#39;s hand. The hand said &quot;the hand is too cold&quot;. My mother is the eldest daughter in the family. After graduating from nursing school, she took on the responsibility of raising her younger siblings. She has an easy-going personality and is less than 1.6 meters tall but seems to have endless energy. She was still tenacious before being sent to the ICU. Swallow food. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Let us have food to eat and eat well, which is my mother’s lifelong obsession. Materials were scarce in the 1960s, but as long as she was at home, every meal in our family would be delicious, with meat and vegetables, and even the presentation was unambiguous. When the dishes were put into the bowl, there would be soup splashing on the edge of the bowl. She Be sure to wipe it clean before serving it. Every New Year&#39;s Day, the house is filled with the aroma of meat and rice dumplings... My mother&#39;s cheeks, red from overwork, show a smile of contentment, enjoying a rare moment of rest. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After we got married, every weekend when we went there, she would happily take out large and small boxes and bottles filled with vegetables and soups, with &quot;food instructions&quot; written on medicine box paper attached. She said, &quot;If I have a fever one more time, you can eat one more time.&quot; In this way, she stubbornly persisted until she was hospitalized last year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At work, my mother is equally serious and hardworking. After a day of housework, she often uses her chair as a table to study by herself, prepare work materials, and write teaching materials. She graduated from a nursing school and later worked as a teacher, gradually becoming a leader in the nursing discipline in Shanghai. In the 1970s, my mother signed up to support the Huaibei Medical Team. In order to travel more points, she sometimes had to walk dozens of kilometers a day on mountain roads. At that time, she was over 40 years old, and she eventually fell ill with pneumonia from exhaustion. My mother worked until she was 70 years old and retired with the title of senior lecturer. She was famous all over the world. The &quot;Nursing&quot; textbook she participated in compiled laid the foundation for the development of today&#39;s nursing field. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After retirement, my mother was not idle. She learned English, sang, knitted sweaters for relatives and friends, and wrote memoirs... She said, &quot;I have to do something while I&#39;m alive, so I can&#39;t live in vain.&quot;&lt; /p>; &lt;p>;When I was a child, every evening we would wait for my father’s tall figure to appear at the entrance of our house at the entrance of the alley. My father loved reading. In that spiritually barren era, we were delighted to get a book. After retirement, biographies of famous people became a book that my father often read. He is erudite and has a strong memory, and often discusses current affairs with his colleagues and juniors. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;During the &quot;Cultural Revolution&quot;, my father was sent to a ferroalloy factory to do manual labor. He had to carry dozens of kilograms of sledgehammers every day. This was a great test for him who grew up in a scholarly family. But he comes home happy every day. He sincerely mingled with the workers. At that time, our family often gathered workers and friends to talk and laugh. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;My father was sincere, upright and aboveboard throughout his life, never ambiguous about right or wrong. In his will, he also told us to &quot;be upright and upright.&quot; He never judged people by money and status. Once, a part-time worker who had worked in our family for several years became seriously ill. He was very concerned and asked us to send money to help. This part-time worker would make a special trip to visit his father every time he returned to Shanghai for medical treatment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;My father has always kept his home spotless. In the last three months, he could no longer walk, and he still looked in the mirror to neatly style his hair. In the early summer of 2013, feeling that his life was coming to an end, he made a will: &quot;I am 86 years old, and I have no regrets...&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;My parents have gone through 53 years of ups and downs together, which is rare in my memory. They blushed, let alone argued.

After investigation, the hospital had problems such as over-diagnosis and treatment, over-examination, over-prescription of medicines, repeated charges, fraudulent charges, and excessive charges, involving illegal medical expenses of 218,200 yuan, of which 187,000 yuan was illegally used of medical insurance funds. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For this reason, &quot;Wuhu Municipal Medical Insurance Bureau first dealt with it in accordance with the agreement&quot;, recovered the medical insurance funds used in violation of regulations in full, deducted a penalty of 56,074.41 yuan at the top rate of 30%, and gave the whistleblower 5,364.04 yuan Yuan reporting reward. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Prior to this, on November 30, the Economic Observer Network published a report &quot;The family of a patient in Anhui discovered that a tertiary hospital overcharged 100,000 yuan in medical expenses. Investigation showed that the medical fee exceeded 210,000 yuan.&quot; Social media also printed &quot;Prestigious School&quot; The doctor used a statistical model to find out that the hospital overcharged 100,000 yuan in medical expenses.&quot; The notification from the Anhui Provincial Medical Insurance Bureau confirmed this report. On December 3, the Economic Observer published a self-report by the patient’s son (a doctor of law), describing how he discovered that there was something fishy in the hospital. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Specifically, the family members found that: when surgery is excluded and dialysis is not required, the patient needs to pay out of pocket 1,000 yuan per day for maintenance treatment in the ICU; when hemodialysis/continuous blood purification is required, the patient needs to pay out of pocket 2,000 yuan per day. . This model applies to the first two months of hospitalization, but starting from June 14, 2022, the amount of out-of-pocket expenses has skyrocketed. After comparing the charging items, it was found that the hospital was suspected of fabricating hemodialysis monitoring time, fabricating patients to receive exercise therapy, and fabricating enteral nutrition. Number of perfusions and replacement of drugs, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On this basis, the doctor conducted a statistical analysis and concluded that the hospital defrauded and illegally used medical insurance funds of at least 95,861.93 yuan to 103,681.93 yuan. A notice issued by the Anhui Provincial Medical Insurance Bureau showed that the actual amount found was twice that. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Observing this incident, the motivation of the patient’s family members to report is a very meaningful perspective, and it is of irreplaceable value in exploring how to reduce the hospital’s use of medical insurance funds. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The patient suffered from the uremic stage of diabetic nephropathy and required regular dialysis. On March 19, 2022, he was rushed to the above-mentioned hospital due to sudden left limb weakness and confusion. He was diagnosed with thalamic hemorrhage. Breaking into the brain ventricle, the doctor said in his own words: &quot;My father was hospitalized in Wuhu No. 2 Hospital for a total of 117 days. He underwent three craniotomies and was treated in the hospital&#39;s ICU. Most of the time, he was in a deep coma. His family could not accompany him or see him. &quot;. This gives hospitals room to raise their hands. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The report does not specify whether the patient enjoys employee medical insurance or resident medical insurance, but no matter which kind of medical insurance it is, the medical insurance fund pays the majority and self-pay is the small portion. The hospital&#39;s fictitious medical projects and increased medical expenses The main purpose is of course to defraud medical insurance funds (in this case, the amount amounted to 187,000 yuan). However, the direct reason for being reported was obviously that the patient&#39;s family members found something wrong with the &quot;skyrocketing amount of self-payment&quot; (an extra charge of 31,200 yuan in this case). The patient&#39;s family members&#39; motivation to care about their own interests was the decisive factor in triggering the report. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In this sense, maintaining a certain out-of-pocket ratio when using medical insurance has nothing to do with whether the medical insurance fund is sufficient, but whether the medical insurance fund can be used properly. Such an arrangement provides an incentive and linkage mechanism for the patients and their families. People will most likely be concerned about whether their money has been overcharged by the hospital, and will also be concerned about whether the medical insurance fund has been abused by the hospital. In the final analysis, it is a matter of human nature. problems, making good use of self-interest can also help promote the public interest. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Secondly, both employee medical insurance and resident medical insurance are essentially compulsory medical insurance (Security). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For employee medical insurance, employees pay a certain percentage of pre-tax salary (generally 2% for individuals + 8% for units). High-income earners pay more, and low-income earners pay less. But except for individuals, The account accumulation is different, but the medical insurance benefits enjoyed by everyone (the social pooling part, represented by the medical insurance fund) are the same. In essence, there are three &quot;transfer payments&quot;: intergenerational transfer payments from workers, young people and the next generation to retirees, the elderly and the previous generation; intra-generational transfer payments from high-income people to low-income people; healthy people with fewer diseases. Transfer payments from the sick to the frail. For resident medical insurance, premiums are paid annually according to age groups, and then the government provides most of the subsidies. The reimbursement rate is slightly lower than that of employee medical insurance, and everyone enjoys the same medical insurance benefits. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If the insured becomes seriously ill and needs to be hospitalized, most of the medical expenses will be paid by the medical insurance fund. Although the medical insurance fund comes from everyone&#39;s contributions, it is mixed into a big pool. &quot;What you eat is yours.&quot; In form, it is paid by a third party, and the patient does not need to pay for it. This is a problem for the patient. Encourage yourself to get more and better examinations and treatments. This resonates with the hospital&#39;s interest appeal: It doesn&#39;t matter who pays, what matters is that someone pays. As long as someone pays the bill, how can the hospital resist making more money? Now that patients are actively demanding more and better examinations and treatments, why wouldn’t hospitals do the same? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Therefore, third-party payment itself will push up medical prices and medical expenses. The ultimate form is British-style public medical care, where patients do not have to pay at all. However, since there is no price to reflect the intensity of demand, everyone has the mentality of not using it for free, and they flock to public hospitals for all minor ailments, but medical resources are still limited. This leads to longer and longer waiting times, and those with serious illnesses in urgent need of treatment are not given priority, and many people&#39;s conditions worsen as a result. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In China, the Medical Insurance Bureau has introduced various cost control methods, such as single-disease payment or DRGs (payment based on disease diagnosis-related groups). In fact, many of the methods are learned from abroad. At the end of each year, it becomes difficult to be hospitalized in some places because the hospital&#39;s medical insurance quota has been exhausted. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To a certain extent, the hospital fabricating medical items and overcharging medical expenses for patients is a cat-and-mouse game played with the Medical Insurance Bureau: if you control the expenses, I will counter-control the expenses. The medical insurance fund is like Tang Monk Meat. &quot;Whatever falls into your hands is your own.&quot; Information is asymmetric between hospitals and medical insurance bureaus. Doctors are the experts when it comes to medical issues. Experts are involved, and it is not easy for a layman to expose it. I just often walk by the river without getting my feet wet. When I meet the family members of the patients who are serious and knowledgeable, I lose my temper. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To be honest, cost control and anti-cost control are a co-evolving game. The Tao is one foot high, the devil is one foot high, and there is no end. As long as there is compulsory medical insurance + third-party payment, it is difficult to have a permanent solution. We can only try to find solutions, continue to iterate, and constantly make new patches. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 03 Dec 2023 23:25:05 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[永世难忘的师生际遇：回忆姜亮夫先生与“楚辞班”]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261766]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-12-03 22:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img img-id=&quot;73919&quot; group-id=&quot;0&quot; asset-id=&quot;70709&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/03/dabd733a49.jpg&quot; img-title=&quot;jiangliangfu2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;786&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/03/dabd733a49.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;260521&quot; style=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(153, 153, 153); text-align: center;&quot;>;Thirteen students from the Chu Ci Workshop took a group photo with Jiang Liangfu and his wife when they graduated in 1980.

However, at that time, university teachers were faced with a severe problem of “lack of employment”. The professional skills of some young and middle-aged teachers also need to be improved urgently. After investigation, the Ministry of Education proposed to let some veteran experts teach young and middle-aged teachers, and entrusted relevant universities to organize refresher courses. This kind of refresher course highlights the business expertise of veteran experts, is divided into detailed subjects, and is highly targeted. For example, Mr. Hong Cheng of Nanjing University was commissioned to hold an exegetical teacher workshop, and Mr. Wang Jisi of Sun Yat-sen University was commissioned to hold an opera workshop, which took place roughly between 1979 and 1980. It was also during this period that Mr. Jiang Liangfu of Hangzhou University was commissioned to hold a Chu Ci workshop. &lt;br>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the autumn of 1979, Mr. Jiang was already 78 years old. But he was still very happy after receiving the task. He &quot;felt that this was a very important academic research task&quot; and &quot;perhaps my biggest effort&quot;, so he &quot;stood up, made plans, prepared reference books, and drafted a teaching syllabus. Use all your strength to complete this task&quot; &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>; (see &quot;Preface to the Modern Interpretation of Chu Ci&quot;)&lt;/span>;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before September 20, 1979, all thirteen students had arrived. They are: Lin Weichun&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, Kaiti_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>;(Jinan University)&lt;/span>;, Hao Zhida&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, Kaiti_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>;(Nankai University)&lt;/span>;, Zhang Chongchen&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>;(Lanzhou University)&lt;/span>;, Ding Bing&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, Kaiti_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>;(Northeast Normal University)&lt;/span>;, Wang Yanhai&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, Kaiti_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot; >;(Liaoning University)&lt;/span>;, Yao Yixin (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>;East China Normal University)&lt;/span>;, Zhao Haoru&lt;span style=&quot;font- family: 凯体, 凯体_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>;（Yunnan University）&lt;/span>;, Yin Guangxi&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 凯体, 凯体_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>;（Yunnan University）&lt; /span>;, Jiang Zonglun&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, Kaiti_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>;(Kunming Normal University)&lt;/span>;, Lu Peicheng&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, Kaiti_ GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>; (Shaanxi Normal University)&lt;/span>;, Li Huang , Li Anhuai&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>;(Guizhou Normal University)&lt;/span>;, Niu Guoping&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>;(Gansu Normal University)&lt;/span>;. Since Niu Guoping did not join the program when he resumed school in 1980, academic circles called us Mr. Jiang’s “Twelve Disciples,” and Mr. Jiang often said that we were his “big melon” in his later years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The opening ceremony was held on the afternoon of September 24, 1979. A vice president of Hangzhou University, Hu Zhongying, director of the Academic Affairs Office, and Lu Moye, deputy director of the Chinese Department, attended. Mr. Jiang delivered a brief speech at the ceremony and clearly stated that &quot;we must comprehensively study Chu Ci.&quot; It also pointed out that such research requires “not only knowledge from social sciences, but also knowledge from natural sciences.” Taking the word &quot;lan&quot; in Chu Ci as an example, I urge everyone to conduct comprehensive research. Taking the auspicious day &quot;Gengyin&quot; of Chu State as an example, it shows that the study of Chu Ci also requires an understanding of folklore. Although he didn&#39;t say much, he was concise and concise, which inspired the students as soon as they started. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the teaching plan, Mr. will give lectures twice a week. One time was a big lecture in the classroom, and some young teachers from Hangzhou University also came to listen; another time was sitting around and talking at my husband&#39;s house, and we were able to chime in, so the atmosphere was lively. In addition, some auxiliary handouts will be distributed before each class, mainly related articles by the teacher. For some topics that cannot be discussed in class, I will go and read the handouts. As for individual counseling, it can be done at any time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The teacher also designated required reading and optional reading for us. Among the must-read books, Hong Xingzu&#39;s &quot;Supplementary Commentary on the Songs of Chu&quot; must be read by everyone; the other five are Jiang Ji&#39;s &quot;Shandaige Commentary on Chu Songs&quot;, Wang Fuzhi&#39;s &quot;General Commentary on Chu Songs&quot;, and Dai Zhen&#39;s &quot;Annotations on Qu Yuan&#39;s Fu&quot;. &quot;, Liu Mengpeng&#39;s &quot;Qu Zi Zhang Ju&quot;, Jiang Liangfu&#39;s &quot;Qu Yuan Fu Annotation&quot;, and then choose to read two to three of them. There are fifteen kinds of books to choose from, namely Zhu Xi&#39;s &quot;Annotations to the Songs of Chu&quot;, Lin Yunming&#39;s &quot;Deng of Chu Songs&quot;, Hu Wenying&#39;s &quot;Qu Sao Zhi Zhang&quot;, Ding Yan&#39;s &quot;Chu Ci Tian Wen Jian&quot;, &quot;Bamboo Chronicles&quot;, &quot;Historical Records·Chu Family&quot; &quot;Mandarin·Chu Language&quot;, &quot;Warring States Policy·Chu Ce&quot;, Engels &quot;The Origin of Family, Private Ownership and the State&quot;, Ai Siqi &quot;Chinese Social History&quot;, Deng Yongling &quot;Chinese Folklore&quot;, Wang Guowei &quot;Guantang Jilin&quot; , Ma Qichang&#39;s &quot;Qu Fuwei&quot;, Jiang Liangfu&#39;s &quot;Five Kinds of Chu Ci Bibliography&quot;, Zhou Shengkai&#39;s &quot;Chu Bao&quot;, you can choose and read a few more according to your ability. After reading each book, you can write a reading report. &quot;Each one should focus on his or her experience. If you don&#39;t have any experience, you don&#39;t have to write. If you have some experience, you can write more. You can submit a collection of manuscripts at any time as a result&quot; (see &quot;Training Plan&quot;). The reading report I wrote was &quot;An Annotated Version of &quot;Chu Ci&quot; Worth Attention - Reading Liu Mengpeng&#39;s &quot;Quzi Chapters&quot;&quot;, which was praised by Mr. Jiang. This article was later published in the &quot;Literature&quot; magazine (Volume 12), and after being compressed, it became an entry in the &quot;Chinese Encyclopedia: Pre-Qin Literature Volume&quot;. I heard from Brother Jiang Linchang that Mr. Jiang later used this article as a model essay when he guided doctoral students to write reading reports. Of course this is a story for later. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The lecture started going very smoothly. Although Mr. Jiang did not bring a lecture note, he quoted literature and compared the similarities and differences of various views. He uses clear ideas and fluent language to reveal profound academic issues in simple and easy-to-understand terms. This kind and natural teaching style benefits the listeners a lot. We were like rain after a long drought, reluctant to let go of every detail, and listened attentively to every word of the teacher. And every time before get out of class ended, our husband always asked us if we understood. When we said we understood, our husband stood up with a smile, and two students immediately helped him go home. Later, we felt that walking back and forth was very tiring for our husband. After negotiating with the school, the school sent a car to pick him up every time he went to class (usually on Thursdays). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img img-id=&quot;73921&quot; group-id=&quot;0&quot; asset-id=&quot;70711&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23 /12/03/acba5617dc.jpg&quot; img-title=&quot;WeChat picture_20230715215113.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;1657&quot; style=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; data-src=&quot;/ /images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/03/acba5617dc.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;260522&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center ;&quot;>;Mr. Jiang Liangfu’s reading picture. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But in the seventh week of the lecture, something unexpected happened. On the night of October 27, 1979, a petty thief broke into Mr. Jiang’s house through the wind window. First, he stabbed his wife &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>; (it was later found to be a skin injury)&lt;/span>;. When the husband saw this, he hugged the robber and was killed. He was pushed to the ground, causing a concussion and a fractured tailbone. The next day, the two elders were sent to the hospital for treatment. At this point, the school had no choice but to suspend the Chuci class. We had to take turns to be on duty to accompany our husband, but he refused, saying that our task was to study, not to accompany patients. So we had to go back to our original unit and wait for the notice of resumption of classes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In late March 1980, I finally received a notice from Hangzhou University to resume school, requiring me to register on April 5th and start school on April 7th. I arrived at Hangzhou University on April 5 as scheduled, and on the same day I went to visit my husband with my brother Wang Yanhai. My husband recovered well and was very happy to see us. He kept saying, &quot;It&#39;s not easy for you to return to Hangzhou. I&#39;m very happy!&quot; It turns out that my husband already knew that at that time, colleges and universities were evaluating professional titles, raising salaries, and adjusting housing; you If people are not in school &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>; (even if they are just going out to study)&lt;/span>;, all of this will be in vain. In order to keep up with Mr. Jiang, we completely ignored this. No wonder Mr. Jiang was moved by it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to improve our knowledge structure and expand our knowledge, Hangzhou University also arranged a study tour for us for half a month at the suggestion of my husband. To this end, my husband wrote us twelve more letters of introduction, introducing us to twelve famous experts who were famous teachers in Jiangsu and Zhejiang (also his old friends), namely Chen Zhongfan and Cheng Qianfan from Nanjing University, and Wang Shanye from Yangzhou Normal University. , Bian Xiaoxuan, Zhu Jihai from Suzhou, Zhu Dongrun, Jiang Tianshu, Guo Shaoyu, Chen Zizhan from Fudan University, Xu Zhenyan and Dai Jiaxiang from East China Normal University, Gu Tinglong from Shanghai Library. When I went to get the letter of introduction, my husband earnestly warned me: &quot;You must seriously consult the experts. Master Zhuan Yiduo is your teacher.&quot; My husband&#39;s academic ambition is really admirable. Regarding the specific circumstances of this study visit, I have written an article &quot;Remembering a Study Visit Forty Years Ago&quot; &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>; (published in 2023 July 3 (Southern Weekend)&lt;/span>;, I won’t go into details here. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After returning from the study tour, classes will continue on May 8, twice a week, once in the classroom and once at my husband’s home. The distribution of handouts and individual tutoring will continue as usual. From May 8 to June 29, the teacher gave six more lectures, plus the six lectures in the second half of 1979, for a total of twelve lectures. We record each of these classes and organize them after class. After Kunwu added annotations and Mr. Jiang reviewed it, it became &quot;Lectures on the Modern Interpretation of Chu Ci&quot;. After this book was officially published by Beijing Publishing House in 1981, it immediately caused a sensation in the academic circle of Chu Ci, and Jiang Liangfu became known as the &quot;Twelve Disciples&quot; in the academic circle. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img img-id=&quot;73922&quot; group-id=&quot;0&quot; asset-id=&quot;70712&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23 /12/03/ff1b130855.jpg&quot; img-title=&quot;01017a5772bfe4e49e_b.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;1566&quot; style=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; data-src=&quot;//images. infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/12/03/ff1b130855.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;260523&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>; Mr. Jiang Liangfu&#39;s classroom recordings of the Chu Ci workshop were later compiled into the book &quot;Lectures on the Modern Interpretation of Chu Ci&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to learning Chuci in the Chu Ci class, Mr. Jiang also provided supplementary lessons on our ancient Chinese language, especially philology and phonology. I also gave this big class five or six times. The teacher expressed the profound and difficult phonology knowledge &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>; (such as &quot;waiting for a call&quot;, etc.)&lt;/span>; in very simple language, It gave us a sudden enlightenment. The teacher also introduced us to the most exquisite &quot;Chengjun Map&quot; by Mr. Taiyan, and said that &quot;Mr. Zhang Taiyan&#39;s &quot;Chengjun Map&quot; is scientific and tells us how to master the laws of circulation&quot;&lt;span style=&quot;font -family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>;(see &quot;Chinese Dictionary&quot; compiled by the Zhejiang Provincial Writing Office)&lt;/span>;. Thirty years later, I studied the pronunciation of 28 characters in &quot;Cangjie Book&quot;, which was precisely due to Mr. Taiyan&#39;s &quot;Chengjun Map&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In short, during the period of studying in the Chu Ci Class, to use a popular saying, it was full of gains. The most important thing is that he taught us an advanced and effective academic method. Specifically, it includes the following three points:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First, the comprehensive research method, that is, a multi-angle and multi-level research method. &quot;Chu Ci&quot; is an encyclopedia, which not only contains rich historical materials of Chu culture, but also contains many important information about Asian and even Pacific Rim cultures. Therefore, the study of &quot;Chu Ci&quot; cannot just stay at the literary level, but should be carried out in an all-round way. In this regard, Mr. &quot;Chu Ci Tong Zhu&quot; has set a shining example for us. My subsequent analysis of the word &quot;lan&quot; in &quot;The Songs of Chu&quot;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, Kaiti_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>;(The word &quot;lan&quot; is found 42 times in &quot;The Songs of Chu&quot;. It includes five categories: Peilan, Zeelan, Mulan, Malan, and Orchid)&lt;/span>;, as well as an exploration of the cultural connotation of &quot;Orchid&quot; in Chu Sao&#39;s chant (i.e., the suitable soil of Chu land, the good medicine for fitness, the king&#39;s herb, and poetry Si Zhi Yuan Sou) were all inspired by his teacher and followed his path. My book &quot;Research on Chu Ci Culture&quot; is a study of &quot;Chu Ci&quot; from the perspectives of philosophy, politics, education, aesthetics, literature, history, geography, folk customs, dialects and even botany. It is actually a comprehensive study of Mr. Jiang A practice in research methods. After reading it, Mr. Cui Fuzhang said that &quot;it has the style of an old master&quot;. This not only encouraged me, but also showed that he saw my inheritance of Mr. Jiang&#39;s comprehensive research method. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The second is the &quot;triple evidence method&quot;. Since Mr. Wang Jing&#39;an proposed the &quot;double evidence method&quot; of using &quot;materials underground&quot; to &quot;correct materials on paper&quot; &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 毷体, 毷体_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>; (see His &quot;New Evidence from Ancient History&quot; was praised by all academic circles. Mr. Jiang added &quot;folk custom&quot; to this basis. Not only did he often emphasize the importance of studying the Chu Ci from a folklore perspective in his lectures, and assigned us several folklore reference books, he also cited a large number of folklore materials in the study of &quot;Nine Songs&quot;. For example, when he talked about &quot;National Sorrow&quot;, he cited the &quot;beating and adding officials&quot; in later opera customs to explain that the poem was &quot;used to inspire soldiers.&quot; Folk customs are living historical materials spread among the people. Although they have not been formed into documents, they often contain the shadow of ancient people&#39;s lives. Although Mr. Wang did not explicitly juxtapose the folk customs and &quot;double evidence&quot; that he focused on, privately we have combined &quot;folk customs&quot; and &quot;double evidence&quot; into the &quot;triple evidence method.&quot; I later wrote several articles such as &quot;A Study of Chu People&#39;s Divination&quot; and &quot;Speaking of &quot;Girls&quot;&quot;, and I deliberately used this method. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The third is the comparative memory method. I was surprised by his extraordinary memory, so I asked him how he could remember so many Chu Ci documents. The teacher said that it relies on comparative memory, that is, comparing the similarities and differences of different schools of thought on a certain issue. In this way, the document comes alive and is no longer a rigid dogma. I tried this and it had good results. For example, regarding &quot;Qiu Nu&quot; and &quot;Two Ascensions to Kunlun&quot; in &quot;Li Sao&quot;, I will sort out the sayings of Wang Yi, Tang Dynasty, Song Dynasty, Ming and Qing Dynasties, and even Wen Yiduo, You Guoen and Jiang Liangfu. , understand the similarities and differences, not only the problem is clarified, but also the key points of the various versions are memorized. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It should be said that Mr. Jiang’s academic methods can be applied not only to Chu Ci, but also to other ancient literary works. This is fully proved by my comprehensive research on &quot;Strange Stories from a Chinese Studio&quot; from the perspective of Chinese and Western communication as well as from the perspectives of religion, folklore, journalism, etc. ;&quot;>;(See my book &quot;Liao Zhai Cong Kao&quot;)&lt;/span>;. The &quot;research of ancient literature from a macro-cultural perspective&quot; that I later advocated when I was doing research and supervising graduate students was also proposed on the basis of Mr. Jiang&#39;s &quot;comprehensive research method&quot; and I will keep it in mind throughout my life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Chu Ci Class has gone through two stages of learning, and it is finally coming to an end. On the morning of June 28, 1980, Hangzhou University held a graduation ceremony for the advanced training course on Chu Ci. The school department leaders, Mr. Jiang and all the students attended. Mr. Jiang delivered an affectionate speech at the ceremony. He said: &quot;I was hospitalized because I was injured by a robber. The school decided to suspend classes and let students return to school to wait for the notice of resumption of classes. After the notice of resumption of classes came out, were our classmates interested in coming back? As a result, the students all came, and some even stayed in school. I have classes, and I am in the &quot;work transfer&quot;, involving professional titles, wages, houses... I don&#39;t care about anything, just throw it away... and then continue it after the interruption, without any trace. You can report to the Ministry of Education, is this happening across the country? Class? Everyone has more or less seen the future and interests of the country and the nation, so they came here to study. It goes without saying that you studied hard during your studies at Hangzhou University... I am eighty years old, and I am the best in the world to have made so many friends like you. This is a rare thing, I am deeply grateful!&quot; Finally, Mr. encouraged the students and said: &quot;You keep walking, I will follow you!&quot; &quot;>;(Mr. Jiang&#39;s speech is based on the records of Brother Yin Guangxi)&lt;/span>; It not only reveals Mr. Jiang&#39;s consistent humility and sincerity, but also is full of love and fervent hope for students. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the graduation ceremony, following Mr. Jiang’s speech, I couldn’t help but make a speech, mainly talking about the teachings I received from Mr. Jiang and what I gained from participating in the Chu Ci class. Although I was completely unprepared, I had never given such a heartfelt speech before. When I spoke, my husband kept nodding and smiling. I know that Mr. Xi is very satisfied with the hard work and concentration of our students. After the ceremony, I sent my husband home. On the way back, my husband told me that he had read the book report I wrote on Liu Mengpeng&#39;s &quot;Quzi Chapters&quot; and it was well written. The main things had been captured. He also asked me to condense it a little more and write it as &quot;Chinese Poetry&quot;. An entry in the Encyclopedia. Sir, sir, you really care about your disciples&#39; studies all the time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the graduation ceremony, the day of separation is coming. Just as several of our class committee members &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>; (Hao Zhida, Lin Weichun, Yin Guangxi, Zhao Haoru, Zhang Chongchen)&lt;/span>; were discussing how to express our gratitude to our teacher, Jiang However, Mr. Jiang sent his son-in-law, Mr. Xu, to inform us that Mr. Jiang was going to host a banquet for all the students of our Chuci class at the &quot;Lou Wai Lou&quot; restaurant. This really surprised us. Since ancient times, when students graduate, only students have invited teachers. How can teachers hire students? I think this exceptional approach by Mr. not only reflects the great importance he attaches to the friendship between teachers and students, but also implies his excellent impression of our class of students. At the banquet, we frequently raised glasses to express our gratitude to our husband and wish our teacher good health and longevity. Mr. Jiang was also very happy and looked at every student kindly. My husband once again told us earnestly and earnestly to study and work hard after returning to the unit. If we have any problems in our studies in the future, we can write to him at any time to continue discussions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to spend more time with my husband, we invited him to Huanglong Cave for tea on June 30, and he went happily. While drinking tea, my husband was still discussing studies with us. He asked us to each write an article about Chuci when we return and hand it in next year for him to publish a collection. He also told us that everyone’s graduation appraisals have been written and can be picked up in the afternoon. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the afternoon, I came to my husband’s house as scheduled and took back the completion appraisals of the twelve students. I circulated them to everyone first, and then submitted them to the Hangzhou University for approval and sent them back to the original unit. It can be seen that although the time we spend with our husband is not very long, he is well aware of everyone&#39;s temperament and academic characteristics, and he is very encouraging. One of them about me is:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Comrade Zhang Chongchen is a middle-aged teacher who is well-versed in books. This is the most important method of reading. If you specialize in only one or two subjects, it will naturally be easy for you to achieve success, but your achievements will inevitably be limited. Returning from the major to the appointment, and then being able to truly master what you want to master, this is the basic element of the comprehensive research method that has been popular in recent years. He is also very careful and honest in his reading. He recently wrote a book report on &quot;Reading Liu Mengpeng&#39;s &quot;Quzi Chapters&quot;&quot;. It seems that his deep understanding of Liu Shu&#39;s strengths is inseparable from his extensive knowledge and carefulness. . He is a rising star in our team. &lt;/span>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>; Jiang Liangfu June 30, 1980&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: sans-serif;&quot;>;On the evening of July 4, 1980, I went to Mr. Jiang’s place to say goodbye. My husband told me solemnly that he hoped I could come to Hangzhou University and be his assistant. Of course I was very happy to hear that. But I knew that the transfer had to be approved by Lanzhou University, so I told my husband that I would work hard for it. Unexpectedly, after going back to school and putting in a lot of effort, Lanzhou University still refused to let him go. I wrote to my husband and he told me to go first and he would pay me my salary. I know that your husband is following the example of Gu Jiegang, Tong Shuye and Tan Qixiang back then, but times have changed, and all college teachers must be included in the system; moreover, how can I bear to take up my husband&#39;s salary! So the thing didn&#39;t work out in the end, and I can only regret it for the rest of my life. &lt;/span>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: sans-serif;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt; /p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img img-id=&quot;73920&quot; group-id=&quot;0&quot; asset-id=&quot;70710&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 12/03/6bcde815f5.jpg&quot; img-title=&quot;WeChat picture_20230715162921.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;879&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm. com/cms/medias/image/23/12/03/6bcde815f5.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;260524&quot; style=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti ;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: sans-serif;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Mr. Jiang Liangfu and the author of this article ( Figure right). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, although the assistant was not regarded as such, the correspondence between our teachers and students continued. And every time I write a letter, my husband always responds, even when my eyesight has deteriorated and I can no longer distinguish my fingers. In recent years, I have taken out more than a dozen of my husband’s letters and re-read them, and every time I read them, I couldn’t help but shed tears. I am deeply grateful to my husband for his teaching and care for me, and I am always grateful for this unforgettable teacher-student encounter between me and my husband. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;br>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange &quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.run&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https:/ /feedx.run&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 03 Dec 2023 22:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[首位博士说丨樊纲：进入中等收入阶段后，真正重要的是后发优势]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261770]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-12-03 20:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: italic , Kaiti_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>;PhD profile:&lt;/span>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>;Fan Gang, the first doctorate in the history of Western economic thought in New China (tied with Zuo Dapei). &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>;Born in Beijing in September 1953 city. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>;In 1969, went to Heilongjiang Production and Construction Corps Farming, in 1975, transferred to Weichang County, Hebei Province. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>;1978-1982, Hebei University Bachelor&#39;s degree in Economics. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>;1982-1985, Chinese society Graduate student in Western Economics at the Academy of Sciences. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>;1985-1988, Chinese society PhD candidate in Western Economics at the Academy of Sciences. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>;1985-1987, went to the United States Studied at the National Bureau of Economic Research and Harvard University. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>;In 1988, he entered China with a Ph.D. Work at the Institute of Economics, Academy of Social Sciences. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>;In 1992, he was promoted to the Chinese Society of A researcher at the Academy of Sciences, he was rated as a national-level young and middle-aged expert with outstanding contributions. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>;1994-1995, served as China Deputy Director of the Institute of Economics, Academy of Social Sciences. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>;1995-2015, served as China Chairman and legal representative of the Economic Reform Research Foundation. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>;Since 1996, he has served as the head of China’s economic system Vice president of the Reform Research Association and concurrently director of the Beijing Institute of National Economic Research. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>;2006-2010, 2015 -In 2018, he served as a member of the Central Monetary Policy Committee twice. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, SimKai, STKaiti;&quot;>;Since 2012, he has served as a national high-end think tank Vice Chairman and President of the Board of Directors of China (Shenzhen) Comprehensive Development Research Institute. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;&lt;img alt=&quot;On August 26, 2020, Fan Gang delivered a keynote speech at the World Ocean City Qingdao Forum.

(Photo provided by People’s Vision)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On June 18, 1968, China’s northernmost black land entered the best season of the year. A unit with the main task of “reclamation and border defense”-Heilongjiang Production Construction Corps - established. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;In pursuit of the goal of &quot;reclaiming the Great Northern Wilderness&quot;, millions of urban educated youths rushed to a foreign land that was covered in frost all year round. In the vigorous tide of the times, young Fan Gang is no exception. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;Fan Gang was born in 1953 in an intellectual family. His parents left Shanghai after graduating from church school and went to work in Beijing. There, after Fan Gang finished primary school, the &quot;Cultural Revolution&quot; began and he was assigned to attend a nearby middle school. But in just the past year and a half, the general environment has changed. In 1969, Fan Gang, who had just learned a few English letters, was assigned to work in the Heilongjiang Corps as an educated youth. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;Logging, clearing up wasteland, and farming, it took six years in a flash. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;Despite being separated from the school environment, Fan Gang is still learning and thinking. Around 1974, the Heilongjiang Production and Construction Corps discussed trialling the work point system and reforming the original fixed wage system, and Fan Gang&#39;s company was selected as one of the pilots. Relying on the &quot;Dialectical Materialism and Historical Materialism&quot; and &quot;Political Economics Textbooks&quot; he had read, Fan Gang put forward his own opinions on the pilot plan and was invited to attend a meeting at the Corps headquarters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;In 1975, Fan Gang was transferred to the countryside of Weichang County, Hebei Province, where his cousin lived, because he was visiting relatives and friends. There, there are only two meals a day in winter. After finishing millet porridge at 5 o&#39;clock in the afternoon, people are starving by seven or eight o&#39;clock. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;But soon, a turning point came. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;Less than a year after leaving the village, Fan Gang was seconded to the county cultural center to engage in mass literary and artistic creation. In 1977, Fan Gang was experiencing life in the commune iron foundry when he heard the news on the radio about the resumption of the college entrance examination. Relying on the knowledge accumulated through years of reading miscellaneous books, he stood out from more than 5.7 million candidates across the country and was admitted to the Department of Economics of Hebei University. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;Four years later, Fan Gang was admitted to the Graduate School of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, which had absolute authority in the field of economics at the time, and studied under Professor Zhu Shaowen, continuing to study his favorite field. Western Economics. There, Fan Gang&#39;s talent in economics was recognized again. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;In 1985, upon the recommendation of Dong Fucheng, then director of the Institute of Economics of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, Fan Gang was given the opportunity to study abroad, studying at the National Bureau of Economic Research and Harvard University in the United States. economics. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;As important as talent is Fan Gang&#39;s diligence. Mentor Zhu Shaowen once mentioned that Fan Gang worked very hard when he was studying in the United States. He often couldn&#39;t get home because he left too late, so he slept under the table in the research bureau. In 1988, Fan Gang, who returned to China after completing his studies, successfully completed his doctoral thesis, and together with his fellow student Zuo Dapei, became the first two Western economics Ph.D.s independently trained in China after the reform and opening up. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;After receiving his degree, Fan Gang continued to stay at the Institute of Economics of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;His academic achievements and social influence extend far beyond the ivory tower. In the 1990s and early 21st century when China&#39;s reform and opening up set off huge waves, Fan Gang was a representative of young scholars in the economics community. At the age of 38, he won the Sun Yefang Economic Science Award, the highest award in domestic economics research; at the age of 39, he was promoted to the Academy of Social Sciences. Researcher; at the age of 40, he became one of the youngest doctoral supervisors in the Chinese social science community; in addition to academic work, he was twice appointed by the State Council as a member of the Central Bank&#39;s Monetary Policy Committee. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;For his contributions and achievements in the field of transition economics, Fan Gang won the highest award in the domestic economic theory circle, the &quot;China Economic Theory Innovation Award.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;However, along with the honor and cheers, there are also doubts from the outside world. In 2018, during an interview with the media, Fan Gang was pushed into the limelight because of his view of &quot;emptying 6 wallets to buy a house.&quot; When asked about this view again two years later, Fan Gang responded that it was intended to express that houses were too expensive for young people to afford, rather than to encourage young people to &quot;gnaw at their old age.&quot; However, if he hadn&#39;t been asked again, he &quot;couldn&#39;t remember it&quot; himself. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;On November 2, 2023, Southern Weekend reporters met this 70-year-old scholar who is still energetic. Perhaps as a result of studying economics for many years, Fan Gang has a consistent determination, as if all the great changes of the times are just pebbles thrown into the lake to him, and all he wants is to &quot;hope that China will do well.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;Only debate is exciting&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #c00000;&quot;>; &lt;strong>;Southern Weekend&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>; When the college entrance examination was resumed in 1977, you were admitted to the Department of Economics of Hebei University. Why did you choose this major? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Fan Gang:&lt;/strong>;I went to the countryside in Heilongjiang Production and Construction Corps in 1969. The books I read at that time were all related to Marxism-Leninism, philosophy, political economics, and scientific socialism. After a lot of study, I found that I was more interested in political economics. &lt;br>;At that time, we also faced practical problems, which made people think. At that time, a company of the Construction Corps could still make a profit by farming with just 20 people. However, when more than 100 of us educated youths left, the cost increased and we actually lost money. It is said that labor creates value, how should we understand it now? At the same time, everyone is trying to change the status quo, which makes me more interested in economic issues. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;In addition to reading theoretical books, I was also interested in literature. At that time, everyone wanted to be a literary and artistic young man, so I also worked hard on writing. Later, I also engaged in creation at the county cultural center and wrote some folk art programs. But literary creation relies on perceptual thinking. At that time, I thought that this aspect was not my real interest, because I was not good at telling stories and I was not motivated to tell them. What&#39;s the excitement, the theoretical debate, I get excited as soon as the debate starts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;The college entrance examination was resumed in 1977, and everyone could apply for three choices. I applied for economics in all of them, but not literature. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #c00000;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;You once mentioned that you are still When you went to the countryside in Heilongjiang, you once made suggestions for the reform of the work-point system, but they were not adopted. Did this experience dampen your enthusiasm for economics? &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Fan Gang:&lt;/strong>;I don’t feel frustrated or unhappy. At that time, the Corps headquarters was discussing whether to change fixed wages to a work-point system, and our company was selected as the pilot. Because I had learned a little bit about political economics, I wrote a paper with my ideas, and the company instructor handed it to me. Later, the Corps invited the two of us to attend a seminar at the Corps headquarters in Jiamusi. It could be said to be my first seminar on economic issues. It was a pleasure for me to participate in the discussion. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;At that time, I was indeed very interested in theoretical research. Although I was not a professional and had no education, my interest was still very important. In the evening, everyone We all went to bed, and I was reading and writing alone under the oil lamp. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #c00000;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;When the college entrance examination was resumed in 1977, you Is the economics major you want to study highly competitive? &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Fan Gang:&lt;/strong>; At that time, there were very few subjects and very few enrollments. For the political economics major, Peking University has one enrollment quota in Hebei Province, Jilin University has only one in Hebei, and the others are Hebei University. &lt;br>;Before I went to the countryside, I was only a primary school graduate and never went to middle school. When I knew that I was going to take the college entrance examination, I only had a little over two months of review time left. Fortunately, I never stopped reading in those years, and I could find all the books I could find. I read them all, so I relied on the &quot;foundation&quot; of reading miscellaneous books in literature, history and philosophy at that time, and I learned mathematics in those two months. There were a total of 8 textbooks in middle school. I studied a little more than 7, and finally scored more than 60 points in the test. Attended Hebei University. Now that I think about it, the whole review process was not easy, and I grasped the last straw. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #c00000;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;：&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>; You once mentioned that most of the university courses during your studies were classical economics. When did you first come into contact with modern economics? &lt;br>;&lt;strong>;Fan Gang:&lt;/strong>;I always say that we are a relatively lucky generation. When we first went to college in 1978, China’s economy was at its lowest point, with per capita income and economic growth rate very low. The Third Plenary Session of the First Central Committee was held, and the concept of reform gradually took shape. But in fact, what everyone was more familiar with at that time was the Soviet-style political economics. The modern economic theoretical system was not systematically taught in various universities. Only Professor Jiang Guangyuan, the department chair of Hebei University, did this. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;Professor Jiang graduated from Peking University with a master&#39;s degree in economics in the 1950s. He studied Western economics in his early years. During the ten years of turmoil, a group of them were decentralized and later transferred to support Hebei University. When I was a senior in college, when other schools were still teaching the &quot;school&quot; of Western economics, he gave us a textbook on the principles of modern economics in a systematic way. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;It is also because this course allows us to master modern economics more systematically, so that we can realize that in those years when we were isolated from the world, modern economic theory It has become very complicated and needs to be remedied quickly. Only in this way can we talk to the world and know in which direction the theory should develop. So later I went to the Academy of Social Sciences for graduate school, and chose the history of Western economic thought as a major, and continued along this path. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;&lt;img alt=&quot;Fan Gang&#39;s doctoral degree certificate.

What influence did he have on you when you were studying? &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Fan Gang:&lt;/strong>;Professor Zhu’s guidance mainly focused on learning and thinking methods. He emphasized the need to read the original works and lay down a solid foundation in basic theory. , forcing us to read many original English works. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #c00000;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend: &lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>; What is your relationship with Professor Zhu over the years? Master and apprentice are like father and son. What kind of person do you think he is? &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Fan Gang:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Professor Zhu is a very persistent person. In a certain sense, it can be said to be a bit stubborn, very persistent, Very stubborn. He sticks to his point of view, no matter what others say. After the reform and opening up, when everyone stopped talking about Marxist economic theory, Mr. Zhu still talked about it. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;Decades ago, he admired the views of List, the originator of German development economics. At that time, List believed that Germany was relatively backward and could not Economic measures adopted by developed countries must be adopted immediately, and there must be protection and certain government controls. Later, Japan learned from Germany, and Professor Zhu introduced these theories to China when he was studying at the University of Tokyo. But Professor Zhu&#39;s views were not recognized at that time, but now facts have proven that thanks to some unique industrial policies, our economy can develop. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #c00000;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>; Development economics advocated by Professor Zhu The point of view has also been inherited by you. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Fan Gang:&lt;/strong>; Some. To be honest, when the country was first opened, we paid more attention to the market economy itself. We were preoccupied with studying why other countries were so efficient and developed so advancedly, and we wanted to learn from Western systems to develop ourselves. At that time, before Western countries and we had reached the stage of competition, we were developing labor-intensive industries, and academic research was mainly concentrated in the field of institutional economics. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;It was not until the new century that we began to have some development competition with developed countries that we began to think more about development economics. After 2010, I started teaching development economics to graduate students at Peking University. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #c00000;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;Except for Professor Zhu, the past twenty During your years of study and research, are there any teachers whose teachings have had a greater impact on you? &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Fan Gang:&lt;/strong>;This is a long story. One was Dong Fucheng, the then director of the institute. I once said in a commemorative article that I was able to study abroad because Director Dong gave me the only indicator. He felt that I had a foundation in foreign languages ​​​​and Western economics and could make good use of this opportunity, even though I was still young at the time. Not from the place. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;The second person who had a great influence on me was Liu Guoguang, the then vice president of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. He advocated reform. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, with his approval, we were able to set up a research group and write the book &quot;Outline of Macroeconomic Theory of Public Ownership&quot;. Although some of the views in this book were unclear at the time. Not entirely consistent with his views. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;There is also Professor Zhang Shuguang, who is now 84 years old. He is both my collaborator and my predecessor. He was the deputy chief author of the &quot;Outline of Macroeconomic Theory of Public Ownership&quot;. Compared to me, the main writer, he has personally experienced the era of planned economy and many early research experiences, and is more familiar with the reality of China. When writing the book, I had many in-depth exchanges with him, and the theoretical system of the book was also constructed by us together. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;There are also some old gentlemen who, although I have not had much contact with them, left a deep impression on me, such as Wu Baosan. He returned from studying economics at Harvard and advocated using more scientific methods to analyze China&#39;s economic history. When he studied history, he not only saw the historical facts, but also saw the economic logic within it. In order to do research, he spent a lot of effort. Even during the &quot;Cultural Revolution&quot;, he still wrote a lot of things in his study, which was not easy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;From today&#39;s perspective, they have been sitting on the bench for many years and have contributed to the basic project of Chinese economics. Don&#39;t forget them. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;Consensus is &quot;balance&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #c00000;&quot; >;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;: &lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;During your PhD studies, you went to study in the United States and came up with the idea of ​​using modern economics theory to explain China’s problems. How could you come up with such an idea if you are not at the center of the reform trend? &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Fan Gang:&lt;/strong>;After all, I had been studying economics for nearly ten years before going abroad, and at the same time, I was studying China&#39;s economic issues. In addition, after graduating from elementary school, I first stayed in the Heilongjiang Corps for six years, and then stayed in rural Hebei for two years. I had a real sense of poverty in rural areas, and also a real sense of China&#39;s economic problems. I have personally seen people in a state where they don’t have enough to eat. I still remember one time when I went to a house in the village. A middle-aged man was lying on the kang. I asked him why he didn&#39;t go to work. He said that there was some food for my son to eat at noon. If he went to the fields, I couldn&#39;t go there. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;After I went abroad and learned more things, I felt that I began to &quot;integrate&quot; theoretical and practical issues. The knowledge accumulated in the first 10 years of studying economics, Coupled with constant thinking about practical problems, I feel that I can better explain China&#39;s economic problems. I feel that I can do a lot of things, and these things are not what I can do abroad. I must do it with everyone at home. I did it, so I insisted on returning to China. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #c00000;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>; Regarding the Chinese economic theory at that time, Do you have any clear ideas or plans for renovation? &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Fan Gang:&lt;/strong>; There is no systematic plan, I just feel that there is a need for systematic understanding and change. For example, at that time, there was an endless debate in China about which was the truth, Marxist political economics or modern economics. When I was writing my doctoral thesis, I gradually realized that any theory is a process of continuous innovation and synthesis. Different theories The theories will gradually integrate and learn from each other&#39;s strengths, so I wrote my doctoral thesis &quot;Comparison and Synthesis of the Three Major Modern Economic Theoretical Systems&quot;. The purpose at that time was that no matter what others said, I figured it out myself. From now on, if I encounter this kind of problem again, I won’t be entangled or come back to it again and again. My point of view is in this book. I don’t have to discuss it over and over again, so I can be free to study real economic issues. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;So in the first ten years after I came back, I wrote several big books with millions of words, as well as some papers and essays. After finishing them, I felt It&#39;s easier. Not only do you no longer need to worry about some issues, but your theoretical views will also be more consistent, and you won&#39;t have to do this now, then that, and always have to revise and correct yourself later. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #c00000;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;When I graduated with my Ph.D., the school had Are you saying that you are the first doctorate majoring in the history of Western economic thought? &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Fan Gang:&lt;/strong>;Everyone may know that I am the first doctorate in this major, but in fact, Mr. Zhu led a total of I have obtained three master&#39;s degrees and two doctorates. I graduated with Zuo Dapei. You can say that I am the first, and you can also say that Zuo Dapei is the first. When we graduated, we didn’t have doctoral hats or gowns, so there was no sense of ceremony. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #c00000;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;During his doctoral studies, Professor Zhu did not You were allowed to participate in social discussions too early, so you only embarked on the path of &quot;managing the world for practical use&quot; after graduating from your Ph.D. What goals did you have at that time? &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Fan Gang:&lt;/strong>;I got the associate senior professional title two years after I graduated with a Ph.D., and passed French and English in the third year. After passing the foreign language exam and publishing works on a certain scale, I was promoted to full professor under the exception, and all the professional title matters were completed around the age of 40. For me personally, I don’t want to be an official or do business. I really don’t have any specific goals. All I want to do is write something that can have an impact on others and contribute to the development of a discipline. However, I have also done some administrative work in recent years, including being responsible for two or three research institutions and fulfilling some social responsibilities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #c00000;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;In 2006, you became the central bank currency Member of the Policy Committee and served two terms thereafter. During this period, a series of problems such as the 2008 global economic crisis occurred one after another. Do you have any special observations during this tenure? &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Fan Gang&lt;/strong>;: It is very beneficial to participate in some discussions at this level. You can observe closely how various ministries and commissions consider issues. From different angles, we can enhance our understanding of the so-called interest subjects. Different ministries and commissions are responsible for different things. They not only represent the overall interests of the country, but also represent different interest groups and have different perspectives. During the discussion, the people sitting in the room, that is, representatives of various ministries and commissions, will bring their own issues and perspectives to the decision-making circle. Everyone will speak out and explain these issues clearly. The consensus reached in this way will be To a certain extent, it is what is called &quot;equilibrium&quot; in economics. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;&quot;Goals should not be specific to things like position and money&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;&lt;span style= &quot;color: #c00000;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>; Judging from the papers you published, you have many academic opinions that directly point to institutional issues. It seems that you are not a &quot;pacified&quot; scholar-official in the traditional Confucian concept. Image, is this a common trait among economists or is it just your personality? &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Fan Gang:&lt;/strong>; There are also people who are more radical than me. One reason is that after the reform and opening up, there was a better environment, everyone spoke more openly, and the problems we faced at that time were more realistic and acute. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;But I don’t want to do anything to impress people. If I talk about a certain problem, the premise is that in my opinion, the problem really exists, and I I don’t want to turn a 3-point question into a 5-point or 10-point question. Although sometimes it may seem that what I say is harsh, the purpose is still to put forward some constructive ideas. The ultimate goal is to solve the problem. This is the bottom line that I have always adhered to. I hope China is good, and I hope China can continue to develop. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #c00000;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;Analysis of China’s economy over the years Did you have any conflicts with others during the discussion? &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Fan Gang:&lt;/strong>;There are always some differences in opinions, and there are even some deeper differences, but in most cases over the years, I have I don’t argue with others. I always feel that I just need to explain my point of view well. Whether others accept it or not is their business. You don’t have to think about convincing anyone. This will consume a lot of energy and is meaningless. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;However, in early February this year, I published an article in &quot;Management World&quot; in which I put forward my different opinions on the comparative advantage point of view emphasized by Professor Lin Yifu. view. The so-called comparative advantage generally means that a backward country should make good use of its advantage of lower costs of certain production factors. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;My basic point is that comparative advantage is only important in the early stages of our economic development, that is, before and after joining the WTO and before the wages of migrant workers skyrocketed. . When we enter the middle-income stage, comparative advantages gradually decline. What is really important at this time is the &quot;latecomer advantage&quot;, that is, through opening up to the outside world, learning, introduction, digestion, and absorption, and learning more as quickly as possible at a lower cost. Knowledge and technology allow this knowledge to play a role in our country and realize the spillover of knowledge elements. Our development has not only introduced advanced technology and equipment from the beginning, giving full play to our late-mover advantage. Our growth in the past two decades has mainly relied on various knowledge and technologies learned after the opening up, and we have gradually learned the ability to innovate. . Now the Americans are trying to curb our development. They use various means of containment, such as decoupling, cutting off supplies, stopping academic exchanges, restricting overseas students, etc., all of which are to prevent us from exerting our latecomer advantage. They don&#39;t care at all about your comparative advantage, because your comparative advantage is only the cost advantage of some &quot;primary factors&quot; and can only engage in some labor-intensive industries that they don&#39;t care about. What they are really afraid of is how we can quickly use our latecomer advantages to Increasing the &quot;high-quality elements&quot; of knowledge and technology has caused them to lose their comparative advantage in this regard. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #c00000;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;You mentioned in your autobiography, While visiting Harvard University, I was very impressed by their graduate training methods. After returning to China, I tried it in the graduate school. What adjustments did you make at that time? &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Fan Gang:&lt;/strong>; Harvard graduate students have to take two years of classes and pass a qualifying exam before they can start writing a thesis. When graduate students take classes, they do not use textbooks, but directly teach papers. Even if they were just published yesterday, as long as everyone thinks they are valuable, the textbooks are only used for reference. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;When I returned to China, I felt that China’s graduate education needed to be improved, so I applied for a grant and invited PhD students who had just returned to China or had obtained degrees abroad to For example, Hai Wen, Zhang Weiying and others gave lectures to graduate students in the Academy of Social Sciences, and I myself also gave lectures for two semesters to improve the knowledge level of the graduate school in the Department of Economics. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #c00000;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Southern Weekend:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;For today’s young people, especially Do you have any life advice for college students and graduate students? &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Fan Gang:&lt;/strong>;I have never allowed myself to be a &quot;youth mentor&quot;, so I don&#39;t have any life advice. My &quot;suggestion&quot; to myself is that the goal should not be specific to things like position and money, but should think more about how to make something decent and provide my own contribution in order to gain social recognition. From a life perspective, this is true satisfaction. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 03 Dec 2023 20:25:04 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
