As for why, you may have heard a legend: Swedish mathematician Gosta Mittag-Leffler kidnapped Nobel&#39;s wife, so Nobel hated everyone who studied mathematics and refused to establish a mathematics prize from the foundation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is actually a complete rumor. Nobel was never married and had no wife at all. In fact, if Nobel had a wife and children, he might not be able to donate his property to the foundation to establish awards. Therefore, in some versions of the story, it was not Nobel&#39;s wife who was abducted, but his lover. However, when we look back at Nobel&#39;s life today, we will find that this extremely wealthy inventor did not have a smooth relationship. His only two scandal targets had nothing to do with mathematicians. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 21, 1833, a baby boy was born to an intellectual family in Stockholm, Sweden. He was named Alfred Nobel. He later became a famous scientist, inventor, and businessman. and founder of the Nobel Prize. His father, Nobel Sr., was a construction engineer with extensive research in the field of rock blasting. Alfred Nobel later embarked on the path of developing explosives and engineering inventions, which was actually his family background. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, in the same year that little Nobel was born, his father&#39;s career was not going well and he went bankrupt due to a construction accident. When he was 4 years old, the old Nobel saw that he could not make money in Sweden, so he decided to go to Finland and Russia to make a living. His wife and children were left behind to guard a small grocery store and eke out a living in Stockholm. As a result, little Nobel lived a very hungry and cold childhood, and did not go to school well. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fortunately, old Nobel finally made a name for himself in Russia. He opened a machine shop in St. Petersburg and designed a new type of simple mine to provide equipment for the Russian army: He asked the Tsar and generals It was believed that the mines could prevent enemy ships from approaching the capital. During the Crimean War from 1853 to 1856, these mines successfully prevented British naval attacks on St. Petersburg. Russia&#39;s earliest central heating device was also manufactured in the old Nobel factory. The Nobel family was the first in Russia to install central heating. This was a big shock to the country of &quot;General Winter&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;With his father&#39;s success in Russia, Nobel&#39;s family moved to St. Petersburg in 1842. Little Nobel, who had not even finished primary school, finally had the opportunity to receive a first-class education. Little Nobel was most interested in literature, chemistry and physics, and left a deep impression on his teachers: he was extremely intelligent but sickly, liked solitude and contemplation, and was particularly fascinated by English literature, especially the poets Byron and Shelley. - As a student, Nobel regarded Shelley&#39;s philanthropy, pacifism, agnosticism and atheism as his guiding principles in life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But the elder Nobel hoped that his sons could inherit their father&#39;s legacy and was dissatisfied with the younger Nobel&#39;s literary ambitions. He then decided to send the young man to study abroad to become a chemical engineer. In this way, the young Nobel came to Paris to study under the famous chemist Peroz. Under Professor Perozzi, he met Sobrero, a young Italian chemist. Three years ago, Sobrero invented nitroglycerin, a highly explosive liquid. Sobrero thought the thing was too dangerous to be of practical use. However, Nobel was very interested in nitroglycerin and believed that it had great future in engineering. After he completed his studies and returned to Russia, he and his father started the research and development of nitroglycerin. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But by then the Crimean War had ended, and my father’s business was deteriorating, and he finally had to move back to Sweden. Nobel&#39;s two brothers remained in Russia, trying to save what was left of the family business. They eventually succeeded, turning to the emerging oil industry in southern Russia. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1863, Nobel returned to Sweden with his father and concentrated on developing nitroglycerin dynamite. Unfortunately, these experiments went awry, resulting in the deaths of several people, including Nobel&#39;s brother Emile. The Swedish government has ordered a ban on explosives testing within the city of Stockholm. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But Nobel did not give up and moved the experiment to a barge on Lake Mälaren in Sweden. In 1866, his experiments finally achieved a breakthrough: by mixing nitroglycerin with a type of fine sand called diatomaceous earth, the liquid could be turned into a paste, and dynamite sticks could be made. He also incidentally invented the detonator, which could be detonated by lighting a fuse. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Unlike his father who studied mines, Nobel, as a pacifist, put these inventions into civilian fields, such as drilling tunnels, blasting rocks, and building canals. The invention of explosives and detonators greatly reduced project costs and immediately became popular in the construction industry. Nobel therefore set up factories in 90 different places, but demand still exceeded supply. He lived in Paris but frequently traveled to his factories in more than 20 countries, earning him the nickname &quot;Europe&#39;s richest tramp&quot; by Victor Hugo. He also developed synthetic rubber, leather and rayon, and obtained 355 patents in his lifetime, making him a veritable invention king. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Intensive work and travel left this inventor with no time to solve personal problems, and he has always been a bachelor. It was not until the age of 43 that Nobel hired Bertha Kinski, a multilingual and well-educated Austrian housekeeper. Nobel fell in love with her at first sight, but Bertha already had a crush on her. After working for Nobel for a short period of time, she decided to return to Austria to marry her fiancé. Despite this, Nobel and Bertha became good friends and continued to write to each other for decades. Bertha was a well-known anti-war activist and wrote the masterpiece &quot;Lay Down Your Arms&quot;. She had a great influence on Nobel, not only strengthening Nobel&#39;s pacifist belief, but also the key to Nobel&#39;s final establishment of the Peace Prize. After Nobel&#39;s death, the Norwegian Parliament awarded the 1905 Nobel Peace Prize to Bertha. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Nobel’s second relationship originated from a commercial trip in the autumn of 1876. Nobel came to Austria and met the poor and beautiful girl Sophia. Nobel was attracted by her frankness and beauty, and Sophia was attracted by Nobel&#39;s money - it was obvious that this relationship was doomed to tragedy from the beginning. Nobel loved and cared for Sophia, gave her money, spent time teaching her, and tried to improve her moral character and knowledge, but to no avail. Sofia became more and more willful and took up a lover in the luxurious Paris apartment prepared for her by Nobel. Nobel decided to break up several times, but he couldn&#39;t stand Sophia&#39;s entanglement and indulged her willfulness year after year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since his student days, Nobel has been introverted and lonely, and was once hospitalized for treatment for depression. Continuous emotional difficulties aggravated his illness, so much so that he once wrote: &quot;Only in dogs can you find many friends.&quot; In his later years, Nobel suffered from hearing problems and angina, and the doctor recommended that he take nitric acid Glycerin - this is the explosive ingredient that made him famous. Nobel complained in a letter to his relatives and friends: &quot;It seems like an irony of fate that they prescribed nitroglycerin for oral administration to me!&quot; To this day, nitroglycerin is still an effective drug for the treatment of acute angina. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the spring of 1891, just five years before Nobel&#39;s death, Sophia wrote him another letter asking for money on the grounds that she was pregnant. But Nobel knew that the child&#39;s father was a young Hungarian officer, and the two were preparing to get married. The main source of income for this young couple after their marriage was shamelessly writing to Nobel asking for a huge sum of money - and in Nobel&#39;s will, he actually took out a large sum of money from the remaining 6%. To Sophia. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for the Swedish mathematician Gosta Mittag-Leffler who is rumored to have kidnapped Nobel’s wife, he was 13 years younger than Nobel. When Nobel moved to France, he was still there. go to school. Gosta had nothing to do with Nobel throughout his life, but he had a lot to do with the Nobel Prize: he was elected as a member of the Nobel Prize Committee in 1903, and insisted on awarding the Nobel Prize to Curie against all odds. A couple, not Mr. Curie alone. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 05 Oct 2023 08:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[奇峰峻岭“外星谷”丨指尖华夏⑥]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257589]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-04 23:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;The Alien Valley Interstellar Theme Geopark has protruding peaks, rugged rock pillars, steep ridges and colorful mountains.

You would think that those salesmen you meet in a noisy restaurant who are engrossed in eating with their colleagues, wearing short-sleeved white shirts day after day, and thinking about which shared bicycle monthly pass to buy when they leave, behind the lean and ordinary appearance In fact, they are all experts at experiencing life. They absorb everything around them delicately and keenly, and when they return to their shared home, they all become Kafka. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Crashing into the Sky&quot; is a novel published in August 2023. The protagonist in the book is a clerk working in downtown Guangzhou. The pen name of the person who wrote it is You Yu. He is in his early 30s and is naturally also known as I think I have had similar experiences. Of course, he also took some classes that were neither salty nor bland, and also ran a restaurant selling braised chicken. But when he started writing this novel with a rich sense of place, it had only been two or three years since he moved to Guangzhou, and he had only a few encounters with the streets that appear repeatedly in the story. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;With no intention of finding a job, he decided to come to Guangzhou to live a low-cost creative life with the money he earned from opening a restaurant. After inspecting several district libraries, and taking into account the environment, the flow of people, and the rent, he rented one at the terminus of the subway line and went to the nearby Huangpu District Library from nine to five every day to write. According to the air-conditioning vents in the four seasons, The scenery outside the window changes the favorite seats in the museum, listening to Bach&#39;s unaccompanied cello suites, and constructing the life of office workers 30 kilometers away. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is completely different from the type of novelist who needs to be rooted in a strange environment for a long time before he can write confidently. In his eyes, the external life that others try to figure out is like being covered with a tight and difficult-to-remove plastic film. Transparent and fragile bubbles that pop when poked. While shopping, he felt that his brain was uncontrollably breaking through physical boundaries, spreading and landing on everything around him. Buildings, chairs, and even the moving light spots on a small leaf were all sending information to him in a steady stream. . It is so abundant that it can even become a burden, causing you to almost collapse every time you go home. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After starting to write, he finally found a way to release. Occasionally speaking about this &quot;trouble&quot;, he seemed to tentatively wipe the dust on the cabinet wall with his index finger. Only when he saw a clumsy and obvious trace did he realize, oh, it turns out that other people are different from me. Critic Li Jing fully felt his &quot;idiosyncrasies&quot; and described him as being like a radar, always in a state of sensing the situation around him. &quot;And he seems to be completely unable to ignore any kind of information or any kind of situation. He can react in his mind at any time, and express this reaction in a particularly precise, poetic language.&quot; She called him &quot;The opposite of Medusa&quot; means that wherever he looks, all solid objects dissolve into living, liquid or gaseous objects, becoming music, birds, and life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When you think back, this &quot;special ability&quot; seems to have nothing to do with location. He could not escape this experience in his hometown in Henan when he was studying and in Shanghai when he was working. The division in time is even more obvious. &quot;The moment I learned that my mother died in a car accident, my hearing seemed to be different all of a sudden. There were dozens of people around, and everyone was talking, but I could hear them all. What are you talking about? I cried all of a sudden, but actually I didn’t feel sad in my heart. What happened to death? Many people around me praised me for being sensible and knowing how to cry. Instead, they gave me a kind of encouragement and made me cry. Even harder, letting me know that I should cry even more. Before, as a child, the entire adult world was actually surrounded by a wall, but after that, you will feel that the dam collapsed all of a sudden, and it poured directly into my body like a flood ( (in front of me). I have personally experienced the changes in every relationship, not only with family members, but also with anyone in the surrounding environment. Everything is changing. This change made me particularly clearly aware of how to come up with a relationship that is consistent with the situation. Everyone is expecting it, but in fact I know in my heart that I am performing for everyone to see.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For fear of disturbing others, his already low volume was lowered. From the first floor to the second floor, we changed seats three times, but we still couldn&#39;t escape the fate of being overwhelmed by the sound, other people&#39;s conversations, and the static of the coffee machine. With an anxious mood, I struggled to salvage his weak response - I had sold insurance, managed the Tmall flagship store of a pet company, had outstanding performance in after-sales work at a software sales company, and had to deal with endless abuse from customers. He was very patient, but when his boss promoted him to lead the team, he resigned decisively. He regards work as a mechanical performance, &quot;I just don&#39;t believe in evil and still have to do it. In fact, I am just avoiding writing.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When faced with questions, he rarely responds directly, with a novelist&#39;s narrative The rhythm is not as simple as taking a small detour, but going straight to a completely unrelated route, suddenly braking when you are not sure whether you will come back - &quot;I&#39;ll tell you from the beginning.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt; h4>;Avoid writing&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You have wanted to write a long time ago ? Have you thought about it before going to work in Shanghai? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;You Yu: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Tell the truth, it’s really the truth. I have loved reading since I could learn to read, but at that time we couldn&#39;t afford books. Apart from textbooks, I read wherever I can see words, such as fertilizer bags, ingredient lists on pesticide labels, and opening paper balls. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The first time I read a book was probably after my mother passed away. She passed away when I was in the fourth grade of elementary school. My sisters were in junior high school at that time, and they brought books back several times on the weekends, including &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; and &quot;Jane Eyre.&quot; At that time, I didn&#39;t understand much about romance and didn&#39;t remember the specific plot. After watching it, I felt that these people were weird and interesting, and they were different from the people around me. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Do you still remember the feeling of reading a book at that time? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;You Yu: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;The clearest feeling is &quot;War and Peace&quot;. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When I entered junior high school—I lived on campus at that time—I would ride a few kilometers to the school in the town every Sunday evening. In the beginning, I had to use meal tickets to eat at school. I had to carry a bag of wheat to the flour mill next to the school and give it to the cooperative flour mill. I then took the note to the accountant and exchanged it for meal tickets. When I was in the second grade of junior high school, the price of food seemed to have gone up a bit. My dad did some math and thought it might be more cost-effective to give me money, so he gave me only 10 yuan a week. But he didn&#39;t realize that I was growing stronger and my appetite had increased. (I) was hungry every meal. I knew it was very difficult to make money at that time, so I didn’t say anything. Occasionally, I can have a good meal at my aunt&#39;s house, so now that I see my dear aunt, I still feel full and feel very at ease. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Once we entered a bookstore, there were pirated books by Li Liang and Gu Long everywhere, while those by Tolstoy and Hugo were shivering in the corner. I definitely couldn&#39;t afford it at that time, not even more than one yuan. After all, I wouldn&#39;t even have enough to eat. I don’t know how I saved a few dollars in the end. Maybe a few months later, I bought two books before the summer vacation. One was &quot;War and Peace&quot; and the other one I really can’t remember. After I bought it, I opened it and found that the first page was densely packed with words and a lot of French. At that time, it rained continuously and the sky was covered with rain. The ground is covered with yellow water, branches are sometimes blown off, and the sound of rain is mixed with the sound of the last cicadas in late summer and the screams of young birds after their nests are blown away. Under these sounds, I watched &quot;War and Peace&quot; on the lounge chair in the main room without realizing it was dark. My dad came out of nowhere and said it was so dark it was ruining his eyesight. Because the wires were broken at that time, I moved to the porch at the door until I saw that there was no light at all. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When I woke up the next morning, I could see the words again. It took me three or four days, during the heavy rain, to finish reading &quot;War and Peace&quot;. It’s hard to say what impact it had on me. From then on, there will be a feeling of another space in my brain, including everything around me, including plains, woods, and rain. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Did you also want to write something after reading it at that time? Did you start writing? ? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Excuse me: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;No. When I was in high school, I wrote an essay, and the Chinese teacher in charge of my class asked, &quot;Do you have any interest in writing in the future?&quot; I thought at that time, I don&#39;t want to develop on this dead-end road, and I think it will definitely be difficult. It was only when I thought back a few days ago that I realized that many people had realized that I must be doing this kind of thing (writing), but I myself had been avoiding it. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Have you had the conditions to write before?

After working several jobs, opening a restaurant, and saving some money, I realized that I had no real interest in going to work. Everything I do is like this: when a task comes, I will handle it as well as I can handle it. There is no problem in execution, but I have no motivation (to continue). When I was a teenager, I realized that I was not motivated and had no motivation at all for the kind of life my father expected. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;After opening a restaurant and coming to Guangzhou, Are you looking for a job? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;You Yu: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I didn’t read for a long time after graduation.

The rhythm of language, narrative perspective, entry angle, and which point in time a story is more powerful are all explored bit by bit. Usually after the changes are made, it is quickly discovered that it is still a pile of garbage. Revise it over and over again, and every week you have to go through that ultimate pulling process from when you think it is rubbish to when you think you have written the best work. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;At most, a work will be revised several times version? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Excuse me: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;There was an article that was just finalized two days ago—in fact, I have been reluctant to finalize it.

The next time she goes to ferment, she will take out the dough and use it. There are two novellas that I have been reluctant to finalize, and they are my two little noodle pieces.

During the whole process, I realized that my vanity, my hypocrisy, my pretense, as well as my sincerity and calmness actually existed at the same time. Perhaps when these four unite to become a complete one, that is truly true. If this were the case, I might not hate myself so much.

After writing, I didn’t think people would need me to talk about myself. Maybe they just needed to talk about how I wrote. The last time I was in Foshan to promote Peng Jianbin&#39;s new book, I met them and realized that they would be curious about me. Why was this? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Especially at that time, it was the first time I really met readers and looked at their faces. Before, I had been writing alone in the library. After the conversation, a girl came to me and asked me. She said that she was also writing, but was a little confused. At that time, I realized that although my answer might not have that big an impact, it might have a small impact. This thing makes me feel quite panicked and scared. I tried my best to tell what I was sincere about, so that I would not be so panicked. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I didn’t actually love literature before. The reason why I wrote it was because it was indeed a way I could find for me to get along with the world, others, and myself. I met (Luo) Danni, (Wang) Jiasheng (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;&quot;Chong Kong&quot; editor&lt;/span>;), Jian Bin and the others , I found that they really love this thing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/ZZhNQSFgRSF3aW6SyYg1ZYul5DeG8Hz4D6AbvSxY.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;1247&quot; data-src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/ZZhNQSFgRSF3aW6SyYg1ZYul5DeG8Hz4D6AbvSxY.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251371&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt; strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Do you feel stressed among them? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Youyu: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I am not under any pressure, but I will be a little touched. I often felt that literature was useless, especially when I heard many people using the term &quot;Sister Xianglin&quot; to sarcastically refer to others. Many books clearly understand people so deeply, so why do people still use such simple terms? way to understand people? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I felt quite empty at the end of &quot;Crashing into the Sky&quot;. At that time, I thought of a long theme, and wanted to write about a person&#39;s 20 or 30 years in a chronological style, but I was When I was sorting through it, I found that there was a person in it who seemed to be a good novella. Then I started writing that, but during that time the library was not allowed in, so I wrote in my room. At that time, I was suffering from rhinitis all the time, and later I was infected with the new coronavirus. I had a fever for five days and died in pain. During that process, it took maybe two or three months to finish writing the novella, which was about 40,000 words. In fact, it’s something I don’t want to publish, and I don’t want to show it to others. After I finished writing, a friend happened to ask me. She said she just wanted to read something and asked me if I had any. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She goes to work, doesn&#39;t write anything, and hasn&#39;t watched &quot;The Sky&quot;. I showed her the novella with mother and daughter as the main line. It was posted in the afternoon, but she finished reading it in the evening and said that she felt very blocked and uncomfortable. After that, she called her mother, and the two cried bitterly on the phone for the first time. For the first time, she heard her mother talk about her youth, her love and her emotions when she was simply a woman. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I don’t think my writing was very good, or that it really played such a big role. Maybe it gave her an opportunity at that point in time, and she was finally willing to have that kind of communication with her mother. If what I write has a little effect on such a specific person, I will feel a little comfort in my heart. She and her mother have maintained relatively good communication since then. We have mutual trust and support, and I am very happy thinking about this. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You also wrote a story about a father and his daughter.

It started with a dream. I dreamed that there was a place called Serisi Dragon Cave in the African desert. There was a dragon in it. The people there made a living by drinking dragon milk. After I woke up, I slowly wrote a poem. A man lives in Guangzhou, but when he closes his eyes, he will have another identity, a story about going to Saili Shilong Cave. After I finished writing it, I realized that it was just a man&#39;s self-pity and pretentiousness. Taken alone, at least for me, I couldn&#39;t accept it and it was untenable.

On September 29, the official website of Northwest Normal University issued a notice stating that the school’s “serious work errors by staff” resulted in “the number of announced postgraduate students being recommended for exemption exceeds the quota for the recommendation plan.”学校发现问题之后已将超额推免计划名额撤回，并向受影响的同学做了解释说明。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当事学生韩永（化名）表示，公示时间为9月20日至29日，而他们于28日下午也就是公示期结束的前一天，才被告知“保研资格被取消”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“保研事故”“保研资格被取消”，成了这起事件的热搜标题。但这起事件仍然存在诸多需要厘清的事实细节，不能简单地归之为“事故”乃至“黑幕”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;保研中的“推荐免试”与“成功录取”是两个完全不同的概念，这一点在媒体报道中被有意无意地模糊化，也让事件的走向有些失焦。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;通常而言，寻求保研的大四学生需要先争取本校推免资格，然后才能申请本校或是外校的预录取资格。同时，保研在录取方式上尚有“夏令营”“预推免”“九推”（九月推免）的分野，在接收单位上也有“内保”（本校）与“外推”（他校）的区别。夏令营与预推免的优先级比“九推”为高，“内保”的把握又要比“外推”更大，这些都是“保研界”里的细分赛道，每个赛道的游戏规则也有所不同，并不能一概而论。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这起“保研事故”中，“被取消资格”的学生参加的就是简称为“九推”的“九月推免”。根据西北师大官网9月16日发布的《关于做好2024年推荐优秀应届本科毕业生免试攻读硕士研究生工作的通知》，此次推免工作的时间表是“9月17日学生申请，9月17-20日学院推荐，9月20日学校审核”，然后就是“9月20日至29日，学校对拟推荐名单进行公示，公示期10天”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;除普通推免之外，西北师大9月16日的通知还公布了此次“九月推免”的其他种类，比如“本硕一体化”专项、“辅导员”专项计划、“农村学校教育硕士师资培养计划”专项(简称“农硕”)、“研究生支教团”专项等推免招生计划。其中“辅导员专项”推荐工作由党委学生工作部负责，属于“高校行政保研”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;根据《纵览新闻》引述当事学生小红（化名）的说法，此次“事故”影响的学生有一百余名，他们主要申请的是“本硕一体化卓越中学教师”与“辅导员专项”两个推免项目。中新网的报道也显示，两名受访学生都是申请了“辅导员专项”然后被取消资格的。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;通知显示，“辅导员专项”由党委学工部负责推荐，学制为“1+基本学制”，大四毕业后要先专职辅导员一年；“本硕一体化”的选拔工作则限定了学院与接收专业、需要签订培养协议书，学制是“3+1+2”，也就是本科三年、过渡一年，教育硕士两年。至少从这份文件的字面意思来看，校方对这两个内部保研项目的招生录取工作，都有着较大的裁量权与决定权。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;问题推到这一步，根据已有的信息，不难得出学校确实存在失误的可能，也就是学校工作人员“手滑”，让两个“本校内部保研”项目的推免研究生公示人数超过了推免计划名额，造成名额超额。关键在于，被取消资格的保研项目，其计划名额是怎么算出来的、是否包括在总名额里，学校又是否有权取消。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“博雅数据库”刊登的一份西北师大于9月16日发布的《2024届优秀应届本科毕业生推荐免试攻读硕士生名额分配表》显示，西北师大“2024届保研名额702人，较上届（641人）明显增加”，其中“辅导员专项”拟录取35人、“本硕一体化专项”则有100人之多。而这702人并不包括“辅导员专项”。是否可以说，“辅导员专项”本身就有些“编外”性质，所以校方有权机动处理？ &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“辅导员专项”与“本硕一体化”去年的名额分别是40人与60人。可见，今年“辅导员专项”的名额减少而“本硕一体化”的名额增加。在“事故”发生之后，赵琴（化名）接受中新网采访说“取消资格的是中间部分”，因为“农硕已经签约，木已成舟，只能取消我们的”。韩永也表示“我们学院所有辅导员专项保研的都被取消了资格”。这个细节也显示，“辅导员专项”的签约时间与正式入学都要更晚一些。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“公示人员超额”的失误究竟发生在哪一个时间节点？为何出现了人员超额的情况？受影响的两个保研项目人员名额，又是依据什么被判定为“超额”的？超额的项目只有“辅导员专项”“本硕一体化”吗？又或者说，校方确实对两个“本校内部保研”项目拥有较大的裁量权，有权在名单公示期取消变更招生计划？这些疑问的答案，都将决定“事故”的性质究竟只是工作上的失误，还是程序上的失信。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;因此，校方应详细解答“发现人数超额”的具体细节，向外界公布此次受影响的几个“本校保研”项目的具体规则。这样，到底是失误还是失信，就一目了然了。 &lt;/p>;

&lt;p>;2022年7月7日凌晨，警方将33岁的暴钦瑞从他居住的石家庄裕华区家中带走，不久，他的妻子被告知暴钦瑞在新乐市（石家庄代管县级市）被指居，涉嫌的罪名是寻衅滋事。 “指居”13天后，暴钦瑞过世。 （&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;详见南方周末App9月19日报道《&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.infzm.com/contents/256978?source=131&quot;>;被“指居”者离世，公安称其余同案人员“不应当追求刑责”&lt;/a>;》&lt;/span>;）&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这里且将暴钦瑞的死因放在一边，将焦点放在暴钦瑞经历的指居——这一刑事强制措施，到底是如何进行的，以及应当是怎样运作，值得重新审视。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;监视居住，一分为二&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;我国1979年刑事诉讼法规定了五种强制措施——拘传、取保候审、监视居住、拘留、逮捕，迄今既没有增加一个，也没有减少一个。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;监视居住，原本是其中较为温和的一种，起初不属于“羁押措施”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;1979年刑事诉讼法第38条第二款规定的监视居住很简单，“被监视居住的被告人不得离开指定的区域。监视居住由当地公安派出所执行，或者由委托的人民公社、被告人所在单位执行。”那时的嫌疑人、被告人统称为“被告人”，监视居住措施没有就居住的“居所”作出区分。从这一措施的适用看，监视居住是一种非羁押措施，嫌疑人、被告人的活动范围虽然受到限制，但没有剥夺其人身自由。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;1996年，修改刑事诉讼法之时，监视居住措施从限制人身自由的监视居住中分离出一个“指居”，用于“没有固定住处的”&amp;nbsp;嫌疑人、被告人，要求嫌疑人、被告人“未经批准不得离开指定的居所”，将其人身自由的范围窄化为“指定的居所”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;从法律条文的语意上看，“未经批准不得离开”是对被“指居”人的约束，嫌疑人、被告人的人身自由度尚有“离开”指定的居所的可能性，也就是没有被完全剥夺，大概属于一种“软禁”。然而，实践情况是，被“指居”不再是“监视居住”本来的含义，变成了一种羁押，只不过不同于拘留、逮捕那样羁押于看守所而已。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;到了2012年，刑事诉讼法再修改，取保候审与监视居住的条件分化，符合逮捕条件以及法定情形的才能取保候审，该法第73条规定：“监视居住应当在犯罪嫌疑人、被告人的住处执行；无固定住处的，可以在指定的居所执行。对于涉嫌危害国家安全犯罪、离开恐怖活动犯罪、特别重大贿赂犯罪，在住处执行可能有碍侦查的，经上一级人民检察院及公安机关批准，也可以在指定的居所执行。但是，不得在羁押场所、专门的办案场所执行。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;至此，立法中默许了将指定居所监视居住作为一种羁押措施的实践做法，监视居住的适用条件上向逮捕条件靠拢，也可以窥见这一隐意。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;监视居住就是这样由一个非羁押措施以“指居”变成了羁押措施，被“指居”的嫌疑人、被告人被剥夺人身自由。不但如此，监视居住的地方，同时变成了讯问场所。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;变成&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;临时“办案场所”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;刑事诉讼法第73条规定的“不得在羁押场所、专门的办案场所执行”，可没禁止将指定监视居住的居所变成临时的“办案场所”。事实上，监视居住的措施，因指定居所，变成了获取口供的一种侦查措施。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这种羁押与讯问并用的措施，对于办案机关来说，在指定的居所进行的讯问，受到的外在制约很少，讯问过程有利于办案人员施加控制和调节。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在一个看守所外密闭空间中进行讯问，犯罪嫌疑人、被告人的权利要想不受到侵犯，除非乖乖就范，自来水式提供办案人员期待的口供；或者办案人员谨遵讯问规范，自觉克制非法取证的惯性与冲动。在犯罪嫌疑人、被告人不驯顺、不积极配合的情况下，刑讯逼供、体罚虐待等就很容易发生。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;由于“指居”的处所同时又是临时“办案场所”，审前阶段的办案人员同时成了看守人员，因此，排除外界干扰，就成了必然的选择。不但被这类监视居住的人之近亲属不被允许与之会见，就连律师也不能与之会见，他们甚至无法获知犯罪嫌疑人、被告人被指定的居所在哪里。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;辩护律师抱怨的被指居者的律师权利甚至不如犯罪嫌疑人、被告人被关在看守所时的律师权利，就是因为犯罪嫌疑人、被告人在看守所尚能与律师会见，在监视居住中反而不能会见，形成一种明显不合比例原则的现实情况。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;值得注意的是，审前程序中不告知被指居者近亲属其指定的处所，最高人民法院《关于适用〈中华人民共和国刑事诉讼法〉的解释》第161条第二款作出了告知当事人的近亲属指居的原因和处所的规定。这是因为案件经侦查和审查起诉，已无须对被告人进行庭外取供，因此，采取的强制措施的细节也发生了变化，没有取供功能的指居，无疑更靠近监视居住的本质。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;应当回归非羁押本质&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;依名责实，如果“指居”仍然属于“监视居住”措施，就应该与羁押措施有着本质的不同，而不仅仅是羁押场所这种形式意义的不同。也就是说，被监视居住的人，应有一定的人身自由，如果完全剥夺了这种自由，就是羁押措施而非监视居住措施了。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;尽管从刑事诉讼法规定本身看不出什么，但是实际办案中的确让指定居所监视居住丧失了监视居住的本质，成了羁押措施。我国民国时期刑事诉讼法已经有了“监视住居”，这一措施是作为羁押的替代性措施，或者称为解除羁押的措施而存在。当下的监视居住与之词序有点差别，但是这一措施的性质原本是一样的。将监视居住混同于羁押措施，尽管有羁押场所的不同，仍然属于刑事司法制度设计的缺陷或者司法实践中逾越法律界限的行为。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;人身自由是仅次于生命权、健康权的基本人权，得到宪法庄严承诺予以保障。人身自由不是绝对的，作为社会防卫的需要、诉讼与证据之保全的需要、对于被追诉人之人身保全的需要以及作为刑罚措施，对于人身自由可以加以限制或者剥夺。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但是，剥夺人身自由——无论作为社会防卫措施、诉讼保障措施还是刑罚手段，都需要经过法律正当程序，那就是由司法机关加以决定，这引申出监禁权的司法垄断性和不可让渡性，非司法机关不得基于上述目的剥夺人身自由。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;值得注意的是，宪法中规定作为保障性措施的剥夺人身自由是以“逮捕”一词出现的。宪法中的“逮捕”不能理解为刑事诉讼诸种强制措施中的逮捕，应当作广义理解，即凡是有逮捕实质，无论出自何种名目，统统视为宪法中的“逮捕”，都要按宪法规定的限制条件执行——人民检察院批准或者决定以及人民法院决定。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我国作为保障性措施的剥夺人身自由，忽视了宪法中“逮捕”的广义性，在逮捕之外，多设有与逮捕有相同实质只是不以逮捕名义出现的人身自由剥夺措施，造成对人身自由的宪法保障在实践中变得不周延。指居就是不挂“逮捕”名目、不在羁押场所关押而与逮捕有着相同实质的羁押措施。 &lt;/p>;

Quan Hongchan has always danced very well before. The problem is that she has grown taller and her position For female divers, development difficulties must be faced.&quot; He Weiyi, Quan Hongchan&#39;s head coach of the Guangdong Provincial Team, analyzed in a post-match review. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the two years since the Tokyo Olympics, Quan Hongchan has grown 7 centimeters in height and gained weight, which is a difficult problem for divers. Zhou Jihong, the current leader of the national diving team, once pointed out that the women&#39;s 10-meter platform has extremely strict requirements on the height and weight of athletes. Among all diving events, this is the one with the most frequent and cruel personnel iterations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Perhaps the most typical positive example is Quan Hongchan’s current head coach and former Olympic diving champion Chen Ruolin. Beginning in 2010, 18-year-old Chen Ruolin began to diet in order to prevent her physical development from interfering with her diving career. She only ate one full meal a day all year round and persisted for 6 years until she retired. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the Tokyo Olympics, He Weiyi once expressed concern about Quan Hongchan, &quot;Her natural sense of strength is fully capable of helping her through the growth period, but the premise of all this is: she needs enough Self-disciplined and using very strict standards to control her weight.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for the title of &quot;genius&quot;, He Weiyi does not agree, &quot;People on the Internet praise her too highly. Only through hard training can Only those who have survived development and injuries, as well as physical, psychological, technical, tactical and physical difficulties, can be called a &#39;genius&#39;.&quot; And this is what he expects from Quan Hongchan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/04/fxA4lGMXHXNDbrmGM8CbzbvnJ7hAs2rdHpuA1UOC.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;619&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/04/fxA4lGMXHXNDbrmGM8CbzbvnJ7hAs2rdHpuA1UOC.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252994&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On October 3, 2023, Chinese player Quan Hongchan competed in the women&#39;s 10-meter platform final of the diving event at the Hangzhou Asian Games&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>; (Xinhua News Agency/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;The platform duo competed and achieved mutual success&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The women&#39;s single 10-meter platform final of the Hangzhou Asian Games Three days ago, Quan Hongchan and Chen Yuxi won the gold medal with a huge advantage in the women&#39;s synchronized 10-meter platform competition. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the Tokyo Olympics, the two formed the new women&#39;s synchronized diving combination of the Chinese team.

The topic of UFOs and aliens has always been a hot topic of public concern, triggering continuous discussions and becoming a classic theme in science fiction works. At the same time, scientists are also trying to use scientific methods to study this field and look beyond the earth to search for signs of life on exoplanets. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Remains of extraterrestrial creatures&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Farce&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;There are endless revelations about aliens around the world, most of which are due to lack of evidence. Can&#39;t make much of a splash. However, the appearance of the remains of two suspected &quot;alien creatures&quot; at a hearing in the Mexican Congress attracted widespread attention from the media and the public. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On September 12, 2023, local time, the Mexican Congress held the first public hearing related to the &quot;Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena, UAP&quot; in the capital, Mexico City. At this hearing, Mexican journalist, author and UFO enthusiast Jaime Maussan presented his &quot;discovery&quot; of the remains of two suspected &quot;alien creatures&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to Mozan, the two remains were discovered in a diatom mine in Cusco, Peru, in 2017. After dating by the National Autonomous University of Mexico, the two remains were dated 1,800 years ago. years and 700 years. As can be seen from the pictures at the scene, the remains have an elongated head and three fingers on each hand. The appearance of the two remains is very similar to the alien images described in some science fiction works, causing heated discussions on social media. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Mossan stated: &quot;These two remains have nothing to do with humans.&quot; However, the &quot;alien creatures&quot; mentioned by Moosang immediately aroused huge doubts. This is not the first time that Moissan has thrown out similar news. In 2015, Mossan claimed to have discovered the remains of a suspected &quot;alien creature&quot; in Peru and held a ticketed tour. However, the remains were later confirmed to be the mummified remains of a child. In 2017, Mozan claimed to have discovered the remains of &quot;alien creatures&quot; in the Nazca region of Peru, but was immediately refuted by Peruvian officials. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The so-called &quot;evidence&quot; Moissan gave this time is also unconvincing. In response to Mosan&#39;s statement, the National Accelerator Mass Spectrometry Laboratory of the National Autonomous University of Mexico re-issued a statement that was first released in 2017. The laboratory said in a statement that they were not involved in collecting the samples and had not seen the entire specimen. Therefore, they were only responsible for testing the age of the samples submitted for inspection and would not draw conclusions about the source of the samples. Mosang also claimed that he invited forensic doctors to use X-ray scanning technology to examine the remains and found that there were egg-like structures in the remains. Julieta Fierro, a scientist at the Astronomy Research Center of the National Autonomous University of Mexico, criticized this, saying that more advanced technology than X-ray scanning would be needed to determine whether the two remains were human. Antígona Segura, an astrobiologist at the Nuclear Science Research Center of the National Autonomous University of Mexico, even said: &quot;These conclusions are not supported by evidence at all. The whole thing is shameful.&quot;&lt;/p >; &lt;p>;The Mexican Congress held this hearing to discuss the AirSpace Protection Law (AirSpace Protection Law) and promote relevant legislation. If this law is passed, Mexico will become the first country in the world to recognize &quot;extraterrestrial life forms&quot; &quot;Country that exists. However, after the hearing, the Mexican Congress did not provide conclusive opinions, and the future of this bill is still unclear. Sergio Gutierrez, a member of the Mexican Congress, said: &quot;We are paying attention to this issue and we can continue to discuss it.&quot; However, after being criticized by the scientific community, Moissan&#39;s &quot;discovery&quot; this time There is a high probability that it will end hastily again. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;New &lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Report&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;When the remains of &quot;alien creatures&quot; once again arouse people&#39;s attention to extraterrestrial creatures, The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) held a press conference at its headquarters in Washington, DC, on September 14, 2023, local time, and released the latest research report of an independent research team formed by the agency to study unknown anomalies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;NASA defines &quot;unidentified anomalies&quot; as &quot;observations in the sky that cannot be scientifically identified as aircraft or known natural phenomena.&quot; On June 9, 2022, NASA announced the establishment of this research team. The team is composed of 16 experts from different fields such as astronomy, physics, meteorology, etc. These disciplines have varying degrees of connection with the study of unknown anomalies. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;NASA believes that researchers have now obtained a certain number of high-quality observations of unknown abnormal events, and have the basic conditions to draw solid scientific conclusions about the nature of these events. Therefore, NASA established this independent research group to examine unidentified anomalies from a scientific perspective and develop a roadmap for how to use data and scientific tools to advance our understanding of unidentified anomalies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The public can download the 36-page report from NASA&#39;s official website. The report consists of several parts: the first part briefly introduces the research team and this report, the middle part answers questions such as how the team conducted the research in the form of 8 questions and answers, and the last part is the conclusions, suggestions and Acknowledgments. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The research team concluded in this report that there is currently no evidence to support the existence of aliens, and most UFO incidents can be explained by science. But at the same time, they haven&#39;t completely ruled out the possibility of aliens. While the conclusions are not unexpected, the report is important in suggesting what possible data NASA could collect in the future to explore the nature and origins of unidentified anomalies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In a press release, NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said: &quot;At NASA, it&#39;s in our DNA to explore and ask why things are the way they are. I would like to express my gratitude to the independent research team for inspiring us on how to better study and analyze unidentified anomalies in the future.&quot; He also emphasized that NASA&#39;s goal is to shift people&#39;s discussion of unidentified anomalies from fantasy to science level. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At a press conference, NASA said that it has appointed a new director of unidentified anomaly research, who will lead the research team to strengthen artificial intelligence in the process of collecting and analyzing data and the use of machine learning. The report also highlights the need to enhance the application of new technologies in future research. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;The answer may be on extrasolar planets&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Planet&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Efforts to find alien life on Earth are based on the fact that alien life has visited the Earth. Such a premise limits the search scope to intelligent creatures capable of reaching the earth. But just as life forms on Earth vary widely, if there is life elsewhere in the universe, it may not be intelligent life, but rudimentary forms like microorganisms on Earth. So when astronomers set their sights on the search for exoplanets, they will be on the lookout for any possible signs of life. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On September 11, 2023, at the James Webb Space Telescope’s first year of operation meeting held in Baltimore, Maryland, the United States, an international research team led by the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom announced the results of a famous satellite. This is the latest research result of the exoplanet K2-18&amp;nbsp;b. They found methane and carbon dioxide in the planet&#39;s atmosphere. This is the first time astronomers have found carbon-based molecules in the atmosphere of an exoplanet located in the habitable zone. At the same time, they may also have discovered what is believed to be a chemical on Earth. Chemical substances related to life activities. The research results will also be published in the Astrophysical Journal Letters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This exoplanet is 120 light-years away from the Earth, has a mass about 8.6 times that of the Earth, and a radius 2.6 times that of the Earth. It orbits the cold dwarf star K2-18 and is located in the habitable zone of this system. . Astronomers first probed the planet&#39;s atmosphere using the Hubble Space Telescope, but its composition was controversial at the time. After research, astronomers classified this planet into a category of exoplanets called &quot;Hycean exoplanet&quot;. Such planets have hydrogen-rich atmospheres and ocean-covered planetary surfaces. There are no planets of this size between Earth and Neptune in our solar system. Since then, they have used the James Webb Space Telescope to study the planet in more detail. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Using the high-resolution instruments of the James Webb Space Telescope, they confirmed in newly published research that the planet&#39;s atmosphere contains methane and carbon dioxide. At the same time, they also found a weak signal in the spectrum of K2-18&amp;nbsp;b. Analysis showed that this signal may be generated by a molecule called dimethyl sulphide (DMS). On Earth, we currently know that dimethyl sulfide can only be produced by life activities. Most of the dimethyl sulfide in the Earth&#39;s atmosphere is released by marine phytoplankton, which indicates that it may also exist on K2-18&amp;nbsp;b similar life activities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Our findings highlight the diverse considerations that need to be taken into account in the search for life elsewhere,” said Nikku Madhusudhan, an astronomer at the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom and lead author of the paper. The importance of habitable environments. The search for life on exoplanets has traditionally focused on smaller, rocky planets, but larger hydrogen-marine planets are clearly more amenable to atmospheric observations.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, , astronomers still need further observations to confirm the existence of dimethyl sulfide. Madhusudhan said that subsequent observations by the James Webb Telescope will confirm whether dimethyl sulfide is indeed present in the atmosphere of K2-18&amp;nbsp;b. This research team believes that K2-18&amp;nbsp;b and other hydrogen sea planets may be excellent places for us to discover life outside the solar system. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The James Webb Space Telescope has been in use for more than a year, demonstrating its powerful observation capabilities and constantly surprising astronomers. As more and more powerful space telescopes and ground-based telescopes are put into use, constructed or put on the development schedule, astronomers will gain increasingly powerful capabilities to observe exoplanets. Maybe discovering extraterrestrial life on Earth is just a fantasy, but if extraterrestrial life really exists, we will be able to detect signs of their activities on an exoplanet in the near future. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/03/LdhG4qqa7a7vUhM2yf5FXKKIbvDGmUxPyUFpWymE.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;635&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/03/LdhG4qqa7a7vUhM2yf5FXKKIbvDGmUxPyUFpWymE.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252973&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Remains on display during a hearing in the Mexican Congress. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Reuters/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/ 23/10/03/2mapv6MsFjVZXXjxxbF70wRaXgQj9T8abzGIy1tm.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;2560&quot; height=&quot;1094&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/03/ 2mapv6MsFjVZXXjxxbF70wRaXgQj9T8abzGIy1tm.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252972&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Member of NASA&#39;s Unidentified Anomaly Research Team. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（NASA/Picture）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23 /10/03/thCtXyW4lh5rn7bzhiFcHXpwr6JJ30BM9cjSnprR.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;540&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/03/thCtXyW4lh5rn7bzhiFcHXpwr6JJ30 BM9cjSnprR .jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252971&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Artistic imagination of the exoplanet K2-18 b orbiting the cold dwarf star K2-18 picture. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(NASA/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 04 Oct 2023 17:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[南阳迷笛音乐节营地大量失窃上热搜：全力破案方能挽回声誉丨快评]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258070]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-04 15:28:30&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Halfway through the long holiday, the Midi Music Festival held in Nanyang, Henan suddenly appeared on the social media hot search list, not because How well done, but because - &quot;stealing things&quot;. For this city that was once famous for Zhuge Wolong, if the case cannot be solved as soon as possible, not only may the next Midi Music Festival be ruined, but it will also affect the reputation of the entire city. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 3, the keywords &quot;Midi steals things&quot; quickly became hot topics on social media. According to information released by netizens at the scene, the music festival had ended the day before, and many music fans who participated in the music festival had not yet evacuated. However, a large number of nearby villagers went into the campground to search for things. According to Solitaire’s stolen property statistics, some people’s clothing and shoes were stolen, some wine and tea were stolen, some camping equipment such as tents, sleeping bags, and moisture-proof mats were lost, and high-value electronic and digital products such as computers, mobile phones, cameras, and recording equipment were stolen. Some &quot;thiefs&quot; only took away the tent, leaving other materials neatly in place. Even the fist-thick cables on the stage were stolen. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to self-reported information by the thieves, the total value of the stolen materials may reach hundreds of thousands of yuan. A video circulating on the Internet shows a middle-aged woman who was caught taking something out of her bag while defending herself: &quot;We just went to get it when no one was there,&quot; as if the owner of the tent had temporarily left ( Maybe you go out to eat or even just use the toilet), the things in the tent become ownerless and can be taken as you please. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As the first original music festival in China, the Midi Music Festival with a history of more than 20 years has become one of the most famous carnivals in the Chinese music industry, especially rock music. For the venue where the music festival is held, tens of thousands of enthusiastic music fans from all over the country will not only bring direct income to the local area, but also become an excellent opportunity to promote the local area. Therefore, many cities, especially third- and fourth-tier cities, are competing to hold or invite large-scale music festivals to be held locally. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This Midi Music Festival was held in Nanyang and also received great attention from the local area. According to the official social media account &quot;Nanyang Release&quot; of the Nanyang Municipal Government Information Office, on September 29, the opening day of the Central Plains Midi Music Festival, the Secretary of the Nanyang Municipal Party Committee and the Mayor, wearing red volunteer uniforms, personally greeted the guests at the exit of Nanyang Railway Station. Music fans all over the country. Half a month ago, Nanyang City held a preparatory meeting for the Midi Music Festival. The Secretary of the Municipal Party Committee personally made arrangements and required the establishment of a high-standard headquarters at the municipal level to carefully carry out various guarantee work for the music festival. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A few days before the opening of the music festival, the Nanyang Municipal Government Information Office also released a city image promotional video and a local &quot;food, drink, and fun picture&quot; through its official account to promote local tourism resources. Such high-standard preparation and reception highlight the importance attached to the music festival. It was with this kind of attention that the music festival itself seemed to go without any problems. However, what was unexpected was that large-scale thefts occurred after the festival. It can be said that the previous efforts were ruined. This makes the previous official statement of “protecting the personal and property safety of tourists” a joke. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to theft, netizens who attended the music festival accused some people of harassing tourists in the name of toasting during dinner in the hotel, and even beating tourists while drunk. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This information spreads rapidly through social networks. If the local area fails to take prompt measures to identify problems such as theft and harassment, it will greatly damage the image of the local area. In addition to the stolen music fans who said that if there is no result in handling this incident, they will never visit Nanyang again. Some netizens also said that they felt very unsafe after watching the video of the villagers taking things away, and they will definitely do so when traveling in the future. Avoid this place. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the descriptions of the thieves and live music fans, most of the thieves were local villagers, who even used tricycles to pull the items. This scene can&#39;t help but remind people of the situations that have happened in many places before where villagers stole the crops of foreign agricultural entrepreneurs. It was reported in the summer of 2019 that a sweet potato farmer in Henan contracted 200 acres of land to grow watermelons. When the watermelons matured, nearby villagers gathered in groups to steal the melons. A melon-picking incident also occurred in Jiaxing, Zhejiang, where almost all the watermelons from more than 20 greenhouses were stolen. Some melon thieves were even caught by melon farmers and fell to the ground and were &quot;injured&quot; during the pulling process. Instead, the melon farmers were asked to pay compensation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In these theft incidents, some places often use various excuses to excuse local farmers. For example, it is not &quot;theft&quot;, but they believe the rumor that &quot;the owner doesn&#39;t want it anymore&quot;, or there are people in the local area who are not the owners. The tradition of “picking up the leaks” after harvesting, etc. In the Midi Music Festival theft incident, some participants alleged that after catching the thief and calling the police, the police let the villagers go because &quot;there was no evidence to prove the theft.&quot; If the property of participants cannot be protected for a large-scale event that the government attaches so much importance to, who will dare to come here in the future? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is true that the quality of villagers in some places is not high, they are greedy for petty gains, and their legal awareness is weak. They have the idea that the law does not punish the public, and they feel that taking some things from &quot;outsiders&quot; will not do anything. If local officials do not take severe measures to punish these thieving villagers and cannot effectively protect the interests of foreign tourists or investors, and their reputation is ruined, no one will dare to travel or invest here again. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the announcement from the Midi Music Festival Organizing Committee, the local police have set up a task force to investigate the theft cases. Some fans also reported that some of the stolen items had been recovered. This time Nanyang must make every effort to solve the case, recover the stolen goods, reduce the losses of music fans, and at the same time severely punish the thieves without mercy. Only in this way can it be possible to restore the reputation, restore the music festival, restore the music fans, and restore the tourists from all over the country. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 04 Oct 2023 15:55:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[颜歌：英语世界里的少数族裔]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/257450]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-04 15:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/20/ERThthpwjc4pFBkH71171Fy2GAIFQY7zJqMvpifj.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;1440&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/ERThthpwjc4pFBkH71171Fy2GAIFQY7z JqMvpifj. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251382&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;(Feng Xiaoping/Picture)&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>; &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One day in the summer of 2017, Yan Ge was vaccinating her one-month-old son at a clinic in Dublin when she suddenly received an email from Irish writer Lucy Caldwell. She was invited to contribute to Faber&#39;s short story collection Being Various: New Irish Short Stories ( &quot;Short Story Collection&quot;&lt;/span>;) Write a novel. Lucy is the editor of this collection. She had read two of Yan Gefa&#39;s stories in the &quot;Irish Times&quot; and found them interesting, so she came here. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yan Ge still remembers her shock at that time: first of all, she was an outsider, no one in the Irish literary world knew her, she had only published two novels in newspapers; secondly, she was the only one in Ireland. How did you become an Irish writer after living for a few years? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In that email that made Yan Ge feel unreal, Lucy greatly broadened the concept of Irish writers - this concept should include writers who were born in Ireland but grew up elsewhere, and writers who were chosen from elsewhere. Writers who call Ireland home include those who somehow find themselves living in Ireland. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What happened next unfolded smoothly. Yan Ge wrote a story that took place in Dublin, &quot;How I Fell in Love with the Well-Documented Life of Alex Whelan&quot;, which was well received and included in this new collection of Irish short stories. The first article (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Published in 2019&lt;/span>;). Later, Angus, the editor of &quot;Different: A Collection of New Irish Short Stories&quot; and director of Faber Publishing, learned that Yan Ge was writing a collection of short stories and approached his agent, Matt, hoping to She gave Faber exclusive preview rights. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/fNclzsO4zmmZmaYmqR2Fj9t55L8glzuUoiCpIvtK.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;1279&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/fNclzsO4zmmZmaYmqR2Fj9t55L8glzuUoiCpIvtK.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251380&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Yan Ge visited Wangcong Temple in his hometown of Pi County when he was a child&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(provided by interviewee/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Faber is a purely literary publishing organization founded in 1921. It has published the works of 13 Nobel Prize writers and 6 Booker Prize writers. There will be no sky-high royalties, and packaging and promotion will not cost as much as cutting-edge companies. If it is not given to Faber, the agent will submit the work to various publishing houses. If multiple publishing houses compete for the manuscript, it will be auctioned. As a result, the manuscript may be sold at a relatively high price. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But Matt believes that Faber is suitable for Yan Ge’s work. It is of stable quality, responsible, and can be cooperated for a long time. Moreover, the editors of this book are Kazuo Ishiguro and Sebastian. Barry&#39;s managing editor. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Finally Faber was given exclusive preview rights. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The exclusive preview period generally does not exceed 10 days. Faber responded quickly. He sent the message on Friday and gave the quotation on Wednesday. After the two parties negotiated, it was determined on Thursday that he would buy the rights to two books, including the completed &quot;Elsewhere&quot; and another book scheduled to be delivered in 2024. The novel &quot;Hotel Destination&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;This means that the next five years are almost bought out.&quot; Yan Ge is worried that the second book is due to be delivered in April 2024 according to the contract, and because of the Chinese novel &quot;Pingle County Chronicles&quot; All work is behind schedule. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The veteran American literary publisher Scribner will also acquire the copyright for Yan Ge’s collection of short stories and the 2024 novel. Scribner published works by Hemingway and Fitzgerald. It was later acquired by Simon &amp; Schuster and became the company&#39;s flagship publishing house. It also published books by pure literary writers such as Annie Proulx. , and also publishes works by Stephen King, the master of horror novels. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/JN1pQDJEs7PrVeKtiyHqlhyTdiV0MdHfQob3MpvM.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1440&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/JN1pQDJEs7PrVeKtiyHqlhyTdiV0MdHfQob3MpvM.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251374&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color ) &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The signing process with Scribner went smoothly beyond Yan Ge&#39;s expectations. The editor-in-chief and two young editors chatted with Yan Ge over video for an afternoon about the work, and in the evening they settled on North American rights with their agent. Next, the Italian copyright was also negotiated. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yan Ge felt a bit like selling futures at the time: &quot;The unfinished novel was sold directly like this. This was the first time in my writing career of more than 20 years. Yes. It may not be a big deal for an English writer, but it is unimaginable for a writer whose mother tongue is Chinese and writes in English.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the summer of 2023, &quot;Elsewhere&quot; will be published in the UK and the United States. , winning praise from media outlets including The Irish Times, The Guardian, The New York Times and The New Yorker. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the summer of 2023, Yan Ge took her son and husband back to Chengdu after three years of COVID-19. To be precise, back to Pidu District (&lt;span style=&quot;font- family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Originally known as Pixian County&lt;/span>;) - her hometown - the birthplace of her story of Pingle Town. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/Xis0q8rlqbXScWzR65rY41RJobjmCII9eySPGN9Y.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;1611&quot; data-src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/Xis0q8rlqbXScWzR65rY41RJobjmCII9eySPGN9Y.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251376&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot; We are here to oppose English”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;I will interview you in the summer of 2018 At that time, you were embarking on a creative writing project in the UK, published two novels in the &quot;Irish Times&quot;, and had just completed one of Faber&#39;s &quot;New Irish Novels&quot;. It was a year later that you got an agent. matter. What impressed me most is that you metaphorically joined the &quot;Special Olympics&quot; in the English literary world. Five years later, you have become an English writer signed with a first-class international literary publishing house. Do you still feel like a Paralympian? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Yan Ge: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I don’t feel that way anymore. English writing is a new career for me now, and I face many problems, but they are not so-called language problems, or language is the most superficial problem, and it may not even be considered a problem compared with other problems. English writing is a kind of artistic self-exploration for me. If I were an artist, my medium would be words. Now I am using a new way, new tools, new materials and media to make works. This new medium will bring a new change to my works. This is the most important thing. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Remember the last interview, you were right I said there is nothing terrible about writing in English. The tone is exactly the same as now. Is there any substantial difference between the two? For example, five years ago you were more free to enjoy the freedom of expression that the new language brought to you. Now , after strict writing training in the English literary tradition, have you found some kind of certainty in your writing? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/eHU1AudW5hab48AceoNgsAEGGT6WpLwPg9ssMeN6.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;1606&quot; data-src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/eHU1AudW5hab48AceoNgsAEGGT6WpLwPg9ssMeN6.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251379&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Yan Ge:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Definitely. During the process of studying and living in the UK, I read more and more things in depth, which must be related. I think these are also based on my culture. After all, I am a Chinese writer, so my literary system and narrative system are Chinese. Although I now understand more or less how the other system works, I feel that Chinese is still my language. The root of this is that, ultimately, the way of thinking about Chinese and Chinese literature is an anti-dualistic way. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the English-speaking world, the writing of minority writers like us is a kind of post-colonial cultural expression that must subvert the so-called orthodox English. This is why English as a This is a fate that postcolonial language must face. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Irish writers are probably the first group of writers in the world to write in this post-colonial way, and they are also anti-English. After the British occupied Ireland, Irish became an illegal language. If you spoke Irish, you would be fined and arrested. My husband is Irish. As an intellectual and journalist, he always tells me that you can write in English however you want. We are here to oppose this language anyway. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So when I returned to Ireland, I felt like I was returning to my second natal home. Dublin was the last stop for the promotion of my new English book. As a result, all the tickets for the sharing session were sold out, the venue was full, and there were people sitting on the windowsill. , I was very moved. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/avrzkseviR85yr9K8a9wqJRvjyUOm3eLrZSKA2Ll.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;1673&quot; data-src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/avrzkseviR85yr9K8a9wqJRvjyUOm3eLrZSKA2Ll.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251372&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt; strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;In that environment, no one will care about your language. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Yan Ge: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Yes, no one will think about this problem. It may have something to do with Irish culture. Everyone thinks this is a natural thing. The two stories I submitted to The Irish Times were published directly by the editor, which made me feel like I had landed in front of English readers. Originally, I was waiting for the editor to give me a lot of revision comments. Gradually, I learned that newspapers here have this tradition and are not very good at changing the author&#39;s manuscripts. Only magazines and books have an editorial process. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/s6ywYWgeztUMcCVqMgdxXBeSyPXZlFhN0QU0bxL5.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;1674&quot; data-src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/s6ywYWgeztUMcCVqMgdxXBeSyPXZlFhN0QU0bxL5.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251373&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;In the English writing circle, everyone reads and comments on each other&#39;s manuscripts&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti; &quot;>;When you first write in English, do you show it to your husband first? I remember when I interviewed Ha Jin in 2001, he said that when he first wrote a novel, he would check whether the words were authentic to his son who was born in the United States. At that time, he had just won the National Book Award in the United States. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Yan Ge: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Some of them will be read to him. My husband is my first reader. When I write Chinese, I will also translate it orally to him. share. But if it involves a subject with a Chinese cultural background, it will not be shown to him, but to people who do not understand Chinese culture at all. For example, there is an article &quot;Hai&quot; (Hai) in &quot;Elsewhere&quot;, which is about Confucius and his disciples. It also alludes to the British political system. People without a Chinese cultural background will see a completely different connotation. I asked a historical novelist to read the manuscript, which was more than 20,000 words. She read it carefully and wrote a lot of feedback. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the English writing circle, one thing that I like very much is that everyone reads each other&#39;s manuscripts, devotes a lot of time and energy to each other&#39;s works, and also gives sharp opinions. . My agent was also one of my early readers. This atmosphere is particularly healthy. These people I trust allow me to be bolder and try more things and experiment with more languages ​​without looking forward or backward. It’s like I’m doing acrobatics in this language. Even if I fall down, there are still people. then. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Chinese writers don’t do this. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Yan Ge: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Chinese literature talks about genius. I prefer the workshop tradition among British and American literary creative groups. Discussions and discussions give me the feeling of being in a community. A girlfriend of mine sent me a manuscript that she had revised 36 times and asked me to make further comments. Chinese writers would avoid doing this because it would cast doubt on their own genius. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;My soon-to-be-published Chinese novel &quot;Pingle County Chronicles&quot; is the product of many years of work behind closed doors. When I first finished it, I was very scared and didn&#39;t know how to write it. I sent it to &quot;Harvest&quot; When editing, I especially hope she can give me feedback. For example, for many ancient poems in the book, I asked the editor to find professionals to help review them. If no one comments, I&#39;m like running around naked, which is terrible. I am probably used to the way Western creative writing groups operate, and I am afraid that others will not give me advice. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/zsh2qmh3keyX0vJMj2Y08Uu0P6vmIJHDLtiRydRp.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;1671&quot; data-src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/zsh2qmh3keyX0vJMj2Y08Uu0P6vmIJHDLtiRydRp.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251377&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot; The editor wanted me to delete the redundant convoluted parts.&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 凯体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;When writing in English, have you ever imagined what your readers are like? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Yan Ge: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;When I write in Chinese, I can imagine my readers.

But when writing in English, I feel a sense of panic all the time - I can&#39;t imagine what the reader looks like. He is definitely not white, but I don&#39;t know who he is - he has no face and no identity. I wasn&#39;t a first or second generation immigrant either, just someone stuck there temporarily, and imaginary readers became one of my biggest problems. Then there is the feeling of doing an academic experiment.

When I write in Chinese, I am very rooted - very grounded, so that I can absorb nutrients and feel at ease, but at the same time, it is also tied and fixed.

They felt that my works It inspired them - they told me that someone like me wrote such a book in such a way, which moved them very much. There are people like this everywhere I go. They are very young, and many of them are ethnic minority authors who are studying creative writing. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I am very happy, I found that I am writing for these people. We minority writers interact with each other and open up a new English writing space. I just give this The space adds some more possibilities. For example, the most superficial expression is that you can add Chinese to English novels. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is easy to fall into the trap of dualism when discussing &quot;readers&quot;. Generally speaking, the English readers that come to mind must be the mainstream society dominated by white people. I think this idea is quite original and very 80s. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Basically from your agent to your book editor Being white and male represents a certain center of power.

It’s not that I want to join the so-called English literature, but literature that is completed using English as the language (Literatures in English). My agent and editors are very supportive of my starting point. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the current context, if you think that people like me must knock on the door and enter a certain center, then it is essentially worship and submission to the Anglo-center. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;If you are not writing for white readers or do not want to enter the mainstream, In addition to challenging traditional English reading habits from a textual perspective—for example, by including some ancient Chinese poems or even Chinese characters—do you express your stance from other perspectives? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Yan Ge: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I will not exclude a certain group, nor will I particularly try to please a certain group. For example, there are local white people in my collection of novels, but there are also Chinese things, including Chinese characters, as well as the non-linear time structure of traditional Chinese literature, and even anti-simplification. But I also hope that every type of reader can enter my text and have his own understanding when he leaves. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;And the partial uninterpretability of the text is also part of my plan. Making certain paragraphs and details into something completely unfamiliar at first glance is also my expression. a part of. In fact, it’s a bit similar to how I write in Sichuan dialect. I don’t want to reject Mandarin readers when I write in Sichuan dialect. I just want to retain the characteristics of Sichuan dialect. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/WfloG6z6i6dlSkOIHtTQzdDOmxz72QNSy24Djnlf.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1220&quot; height= &quot;994&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/20/WfloG6z6i6dlSkOIHtTQzdDOmxz72QNSy24Djnlf.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;251367&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&quot;Elsewhere&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the collection &quot;Elsewhere&quot;, it is a bit like a mixture, with some traditional Western literary meanings novel, but also has Chinese logic and Chinese literary values.

I felt a little embarrassed at that time. As a writer, I was very willing to accept other people&#39;s opinions, but in the end I wrote her a long email saying that this was an ancient Chinese story, so I hope This classical China is both in content and form. I said that the protagonist of this story is Shen Kuo, and his book wants to cover everything in the universe. This inclusiveness is also the focus of this story. I also talked about some background about implicitness and leisurely writing, and finally she was convinced by me. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;When it comes to Chinese writers who write in English, people will mention Ha Jin or Li Yiyun, their backgrounds are completely different from yours.

Why should I try to please white people? I feel like my work is more de-duality. If I were asked to write like a white person, I wouldn’t want to. It doesn’t make any sense to me and is a particularly ridiculous thing. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Another fortunate thing is that Ha Jin and Li Yiyun have helped our generation of writers complete the exploration of themes and wrote many &quot;Chinese stories&quot;. Our generation can no longer When writing in English, the subject matter can be broader and the form can be freer. I read Li Yiyun&#39;s first short story collection more than ten years ago when I first went abroad. At that time, I couldn&#39;t see how good it was. That book was actually not written for Chinese readers like me. Now her works have long gone out of the box at that time, becoming more and more open and better. To a certain extent, it is precisely because the kind of &quot;Chinese stories&quot; that the white mainstream society needed have been written before. Now she and many of us can get out of this stereotype and write stories related to China or It has nothing to do with it. If you write about the real or virtual world, the Middle Ages or the sci-fi future, you can be more creative in content and form. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(Interview Assistant: Zhu Zhu.)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 04 Oct 2023 15:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[女子10米台，全红婵失误后反超以微弱优势夺冠]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258066]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-04 13:00:03&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img img-id=&quot;72935&quot; group-id=&quot;0&quot; asset-id=&quot;69789&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/04/50c67b3a66.jpg&quot; img-title=&quot;On October 3, 2023, Quan Hongchan and Chen Yuxi will each Holding their cute dolls in their hands..jpg&quot; alt=&quot;On October 3, 2023, Quan Hongchan and Chen Yuxi held their respective cute dolls in their hands.&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height =&quot;721&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/04/50c67b3a66.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;252983&quot; style=&quot;&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt; p>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On October 3, 2023, Quan Hongchan and Chen Yuxi held their respective cute dolls in their hands. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On the evening of October 3, 2023, the championship battle for the women&#39;s single 10-meter platform diving event at the Hangzhou Asian Games became Quan Hongchan and Chen Yuxi The rivalry between this pair of teammates.
