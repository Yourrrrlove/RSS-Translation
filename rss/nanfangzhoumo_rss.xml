Her first two works were &quot;Victoria&quot; and &quot;Sibyl&quot;, both of which were self-written and directed, focusing on female expression. At the same time, Justine Trier is also the third female director in the history of Cannes to win the Palme d&#39;Or for this film. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/033b7143c76d1a17a561c001a6337809.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;658&quot; height=&quot;580&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/033b7143c76d1a17a561c001a6337809.png&quot; data-key=&quot;255201 &quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The starring role is German actress Sandra Wheeler.

Coupled with her androgynous temperament, she has accumulated many readers. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On this day, while Sandra was being interviewed by a young female student majoring in literature, loud music suddenly came from upstairs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This reckless and rude interruption announced the existence of another person: Sandra&#39;s husband Samuel. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/2a233abb47c91b2b9aca1796fa31f56a.gif&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;454&quot; height=&quot;208&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/2a233abb47c91b2b9aca1796fa31f56a.gif&quot; data-key=&quot;255202&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Samuel was originally a university professor and also wanted to write. However, unlike his wife, who was full of literary ideas, he seemed to always get stuck halfway and find it difficult to write. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The two have an 11-year-old son named Daniel, who is visually impaired. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;However, this disability is not congenital, but is caused to some extent by Samuel: One day a few years ago, Samuel was supposed to pick up Daniel from school. But he suddenly got inspiration for writing and hired someone to pick up his son. During this period, Daniel had a car accident and damaged his eyes. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/0e5d5d53c24c303e43af529eef9a9e42.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;567&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/0e5d5d53c24c303e43af529eef9a9e42.png&quot; data-key=&quot;255205 &quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The accident not only interrupted their careers, but also put this middle-class family into financial difficulties due to medical expenses. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In order to reduce debt pressure, Samuel suggested moving his family from London, England to his hometown in the suburbs of France. For Sandra, she lost her stable life in London and entered an unfamiliar environment. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/3ec418927ff0374335b782d2fcc342db.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;764&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/3ec418927ff0374335b782d2fcc342db.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;255203 &quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Sandra has no one here, and her interview with the female student can only end hastily after being interrupted by Samuel. Soon, Daniel, who was returning from walking his dog, found his father&#39;s bloody body in the snow. He shouted for his mother, and Sandra, who came in a hurry, quickly called the police. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/44b3b74826c847b3c87d02170b682e1f.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;583&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/44b3b74826c847b3c87d02170b682e1f.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;255207 &quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;After identification, the fatal injury to the deceased Samuel was a heavy blow to the head.

Samuel usually had no enemies. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Thus, the common conclusion in crime movies&lt;/span>; is readily apparent: the murderer is the wife Sandra, and she must be resentful of her husband. Is this really the case? &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;span>;&lt;strong>;02&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Sandra was controlled as the first suspect, and Daniel was on the scene The only witness. To prove her innocence, Sandra must convince the judge that there is love but not hatred between her and her husband, and that she has no motive for killing. At this point,&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;a death case has become a trial of a marriage. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;&quot;Anatomy of Death from Falling from a Building&quot; also enters into the detailed &lt;/span>;&lt;span>;analysis of marriage relationships: When a person &lt;/span>;&lt;span>; dies In this case, how can the other party prove itself? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/bf38fa94449b2a9fc2b78564bee0aa10.gif&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;454&quot; height=&quot;208&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/bf38fa94449b2a9fc2b78564bee0aa10.gif&quot; data-key=&quot;255210 &quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;At this time, except for Sandra, everyone else was basically in the same blind&lt;span>; situation as Daniel. After all, except for the two parties involved, everyone is an outsider in this relationship. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/259bf13f1bdeb716989d9140f58e3dcc.gif&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;454&quot; height=&quot;208&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/259bf13f1bdeb716989d9140f58e3dcc.gif&quot; data-key=&quot;255206 &quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;So neither the psychiatrist’s testimony, which was heavily psychoanalytic, nor the defense provided by lawyers on both sides, could touch the real Samuel. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;There is no way to reach the core of a living person or a love through words. But this trial has to find the truth through language. This is the contradiction. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/d8365786989286236ed63fd6dfce40a2.gif&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;454&quot; height=&quot;208&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/d8365786989286236ed63fd6dfce40a2.gif&quot; data-key=&quot;255209 &quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Because she was in France, Sandra had to use her unskilled language to defend herself.

The film also completely enters the climax after the opening 80 minutes. . Samuel carried Sandra on his back and recorded the heated argument that broke out between the two on the day before her death. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In the recording, Samuel accused Sandra of only caring about her career and ignoring her family, saying that she was always aloof, saying that she clearly blamed herself for causing Daniel&#39;s tragedy but refused to admit it. She plagiarized her own ideas and cheated on her physically...&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/ 9bd78f2696a3e569e9c4cdfb5db51903.gif&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;454&quot; height=&quot;208&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/ 24/9bd78f2696a3e569e9c4cdfb5db51903.gif&quot; data-key=&quot;255217&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Sandra was not to be outdone. From the beginning, she calmly advised Samuel not to complain and not to be self-motivated, but later she became unbearable.

But is this really the case? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/c1015b22701e26ec628373b7019690b8.gif&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;454&quot; height=&quot;208&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/c1015b22701e26ec628373b7019690b8.gif&quot; data-key=&quot;255212&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;span>;&lt;strong>;03&lt;/strong>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;&quot;Anatomy of Death from a Fall&quot; is a work that analyzes marriage as delicately as a scalpel. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;As a middle-aged female director, Justine Trier has not only gotten rid of the male perspective, but also has passed the stage of young women&#39;s blind longing for marriage. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;On the one hand, she is very creative in placing the marriage relationship in the court scene to analyze, on the other hand, she still has the unique tenderness and pioneering spirit of women. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;For example, in the setting of the heroine Sandra, she has a strong androgynous temperament, which is different from common female images. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/16e460de70bbb0da317356adaee6a64a.gif&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;454&quot; height=&quot;208&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/16e460de70bbb0da317356adaee6a64a.gif&quot; data-key=&quot;255215 &quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the same time, compared to common settings, the situations and personalities of Sandra and Samuel are also reversed: Sandra has a successful career, a peaceful personality, and is close to her children; while Samuel Not only did I encounter a career development bottleneck, but I also became more emotional and exhausted my creativity. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;This image and gender setting itself break through the stereotype of male narrative. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In addition, the film uses calm and restrained lens language and narrative expression, trying to go deeper into the truth of the death case and give the audience a sense of clarity beyond the case itself. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;There are two recordings in the movie, one is the interview of the female student that day, and the other is the quarrel privately recorded by Samuel. These two daily conversations were analyzed and interpreted word for word in public in court, and were even used as evidence of crimes. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;When the second quarrel started by Samuel appears in court, the gender balance begins to tilt, and Sandra needs to explain all of Samuel&#39;s dilemmas : Why does he have to choose between work and family? Why does he never have time to write novels? Why is his creativity exhausted while she publishes novels frequently? Why is he frigid and she cheats on her physically? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;At this time, the intimate relationship must be put on the table to experience the scrutiny of others, and then others will give the final conclusion. Sandra was extremely embarrassed. What she encountered was not only a discussion about gender, but also a trial of marriage. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;At the age of only 11, their son Daniel has already experienced major events such as car accidents, disability, the death of his father and defending his mother. He is actually the avatar of the audience. After listening to the trial half-blindly, he finally chose his mother. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/1b3521e273bea7b3042a551243609361.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;810&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/1b3521e273bea7b3042a551243609361.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;255214 &quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;But this choice itself, even Sandra&#39;s innocence itself, cannot achieve complete emotional catharsis, because when feelings need to be judged, it means that there will be no survivors. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The film&#39;s use of telephoto lenses, soft light, and close-up lenses makes the images presented in the film more cold and distant. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/b399ca425c211cb2ed16619ea2e2877a.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;763&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/b399ca425c211cb2ed16619ea2e2877a.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;255216 &quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In addition to the exquisite narrative of &quot;Anatomy of Death from a Fall&quot;, the most commendable thing is the performance of the heroine. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;On the one hand, she is a talented and famous writer, and on the other hand, she is a wife and mother who is troubled by intimate relationships. The emotions and gestures she expresses directly support her.

The cave &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Zhang Wei/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tawny and bare, this was my first impression of Luozha County. Luozha County is located in a mountain valley, and the county seat winds along the only mountain road in the middle. I chose to come to Luozha, Shannan City, to visit the Sakagutuo Temple with a history of more than 900 years in the Border Se Township. This is a pilgrimage road often walked by Buddhists. It has a long history and a mysterious place. As for the scenery, although I am not a Buddhist, I am also full of yearning for the beautiful scenery on the border. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At 9 o&#39;clock in the morning, I set off from the bus station in the northern suburbs of Lhasa and passed through the beautiful Yanghu Lake and rows of snow-capped mountains. When I arrived in Lozha County, it was about 4 o&#39;clock in the afternoon. I immediately bought the only daily ticket at the station. A ticket to Sexiang. It still takes nearly two hours to drive to Sexiang. The road begins to narrow and there are more gravels. But I was still attracted by the barren and spectacular scenery outside the window. One side of the car is close to the exposed rocks, and the other side is close to the rushing river. The river is rushing forward happily, as if it is racing with the car. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/4CJwybPlikMf1N8rb8DErCaYsiUpV1g4HfqvdEr5.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;641&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/4CJwybPlikMf1N8rb8DErCaYsiUpV1g4HfqvdEr5.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255466&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Loza County&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Zhang Wei/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There were only five or six people on the bus An old Tibetan man, a young Tibetan man and me. The young Tibetan man comes from the Garze region and has been traveling to Tibet for more than half a year. This time he went specifically to Lapu Hot Spring in Sexiang. He wore a down jacket and carried a small plastic bag with him, but no other luggage. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It was already 7:30 when I arrived in Sexiang. I quickly found a place to stay before it got dark. The entire township is located on a flat land in the mountains. There are dozens of buildings built along the road. They are all occupied by local people. In order to welcome guests, some have been converted into hotels and some into restaurants. Hotels are either closed or full, and the owner is rarely there, leaving only a phone number. Finally, I finally found a bed at the Sakaguto Temple Hotel. There was a public bathroom, but I couldn&#39;t take a shower. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/Zr1UWUXJhF4ejzye7gI0fYIs2ePDIci33DQAPxht.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;702&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/Zr1UWUXJhF4ejzye7gI0fYIs2ePDIci33DQAPxht.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255467&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Saika Gutuo Temple in Sexiang&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Zhang Wei/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;sai Kagutuo Monastery was originally a monastery of the Kagyu sect of Tibetan Buddhism, but later converted to the Gelug sect. It is a must-visit place for Tibetan pilgrims. The main building of Sakagutuo Temple, which has a history of more than 900 years, has been relatively completely preserved. The temple is located in the middle of Se Township, next to the cliff, and the sound of rushing river water comes from the bottom of the mountain, which is quiet and distant. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is a legendary and touching story of redemption behind the nine-story tower of Sakagutuo Temple. According to legend, in the 11th century, Marpa, the founder of the Kagyu sect, who was known as &quot;one of the seven great translators of ancient Tibet&quot;, had a disciple named Milarepa. He lost his father when he was young, his wealth was seized by relatives, and his family was enslaved. When he grew up, he learned magic and killed 35 people in revenge. Later, in order to atone for his sins, Milarepa came to Sexiang to become a disciple of Marpa. Marpa ordered Milarepa to build Sakagutuo Temple alone (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 毷体, 毷体_GB2312, STKaiti ;&quot;>;Means &quot;Nine-story Gongzi Castle&quot;&lt;/span>;). Day after day, year after year, every time he built it, Marpa asked him to overthrow and rebuild it, until it was finally completed the sixth time. The current Sakagutuo Temple was built at that time (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;later repaired and expanded&lt;/span>;). Ancient prayer wheels hang on the outside of the predominantly yellow temple, and murals from hundreds of years ago can still be faintly seen on the mottled walls inside. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/pxdG2sSTqGXq9MC2LtS1A4lLkzoChetIoN1Fsd6t.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;641&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/pxdG2sSTqGXq9MC2LtS1A4lLkzoChetIoN1Fsd6t.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255472&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Green space by the Sexiang River and a released calf&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Zhang Wei/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p >; &lt;p>;There is a small suspended plank road on the top of the 9-story watchtower tower for people to pray for blessings. When I climbed to the ninth floor, a lama said that since I had come up, I should go around the tower. It is said that turning once can wash away all the bad luck in the past life; turning twice can pray for the health and happiness of parents; turning three times will prevent you from falling into hell in the next life. However, except for the steel poles that can be grasped by hand, there are no protective fences around the top of the tower. I was afraid of heights and dared not go up. Finally, I walked around in a circle under the leadership of the lama. The young lama chanted sutras while walking. He walked many times every day and it became a daily routine. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Sakagutuo Temple is very small and can be completed in less than half an hour. On the top of the mountain south of Sexiang, there is also Lodro Wolong Monastery, which is the birthplace of the Kagyu Sect of Tibetan Buddhism and was built by Master Marpa when he was 29 years old. According to the official website of Luozha County Government, &quot;Luo&quot; means &quot;south&quot;, &quot;Zhuowo&quot; means &quot;beginning of auspiciousness&quot;, and &quot;Long&quot; means &quot;prophecy&quot;. Luozhawolong Temple is where the master predicted and prophesied. place. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It takes several hours to walk to the Luozhuo Wolong Temple on the top of the mountain, and there is no public transportation. I found a ride on the road and met a Tibetan family who drove up the mountain and picked me up. The family came from neighboring Cona County and came to Luozha County for pilgrimage for the first time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/inSaPHeNkpXYh4IsTR42m20Z8b2IQG4o1WhqTgvd.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;641&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/inSaPHeNkpXYh4IsTR42m20Z8b2IQG4o1WhqTgvd.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255471&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color ) &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sexiang is dozens of kilometers away from Bhutan. Opposite the Sekhar Guto Temple is the Bhutanese commodity store, and the back of the mountain where Lodro Wolong Temple is located is In Bhutan, our ID cards were held at the checkpoint on the way up the mountain. The dusty gravel road was winding and difficult to walk. A couple from Guangdong decided to give up after driving for a short distance, but this Tibetan family did not. After half an hour, we successfully reached the top of the mountain. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are only temples on the mountain, and the landscape is extremely open. Several huge crows are circling overhead, and the shadows of clouds are cast on the mountain. Lodzo Wolong Temple is built along the stone wall on the top of the mountain. In addition to the main temple, there are also many small hermitages scattered under the cliff. A lama who has been practicing for many years has long hair reaching his waist. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The lamas in Lodro Wolong Monastery are the most enthusiastic lamas I have ever encountered. They explained the story behind the temple to everyone who went up the mountain. Although I was the only Han tourist, after they finished telling a long list of Tibetan words, they would tell it to me again in Chinese. According to them, the old Lodro Wolong Temple was destroyed and was rebuilt in 1992. There is a sky burial platform at the top of the mountain. A lama in his twenties said that it was built based on a stone that Marpa carried back from India where he studied scriptures for 12 years. On the hillside at the foot of the temple, there is a flat area surrounded by prayer flags. The place where stones are piled is Shunyuantian. According to legend, this is the place where Marpa and Milarepa met for the first time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;We stayed on the mountain for more than half a day, during which time the temple held a Dharma ceremony and witnessed the Tibetan Buddhist Dharma ceremony. Finally, I went down the mountain with the Tibetan family, and the car went around the zigzag road back to Sexiang. We separated and continued our journeys. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 28 Oct 2023 21:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[好心多修120米路要拆除？公共资金不能这么造丨快评]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259415]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-28 20:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;A long-awaited road has been built an extra 120 meters, becoming an illegal land occupation and will be demolished , wait until the procedures are completed before re-doing it. Why is it so fussy? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to reports from the Hunan Radio and Television Urban Channel, a new road in Changsha City that nearby residents have long awaited will be opened soon. However, a section of this road was suddenly surrounded again recently, and excavators were excavating the paved asphalt road. Street lights, street trees and other facilities on the roadside were also dismantled and removed, and garbage trucks were also brought in from other places. The loess was transported and poured on the road. What happened? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It turns out that the main part of this road is in Changsha Economic Development Zone, but it extends 120 meters to Furong District. When the Economic Development Zone Urban Construction Company was building the road, it built an extra 120 meters along the way without going through the construction application procedures with the relevant departments of Furong District. The Furong District Natural Resources and Planning Department determined that this was “illegal land occupation.” As a result, the Economic Development Zone Urban Construction Company responsible for the construction began to demolish the road. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to media reports, staff from the Economic Development Zone Urban Construction Company said that they agreed that the land was indeed being used illegally, but they were &quot;purely out of good intentions.&quot; Also, if we don&#39;t build more of these 120 meters, there may be no way to connect it with other roads, and there will be a section of &quot;intestinal obstruction&quot; in the middle, so it won&#39;t make much sense to build this road, so we &quot;kindly&quot; help and provide money and efforts to complete it. The more than 100 meters of road should be repaired. So when they were deemed illegal by the relevant departments of Furong District, they felt a little aggrieved. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For Furong District, the extra 120 meters of road construction is within my jurisdiction. According to regulations, road construction should follow procedures and be submitted for approval in advance. It is of course illegal to build roads without approval. The competent department requires that the illegal status be eliminated and the construction be restored to its original state. The construction application procedures will be completed before re-repairing, which is completely &quot;in accordance with the law and regulations and in compliance with the procedures.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There seems to be nothing wrong with both sides. However, after construction and demolition, demolition and construction again, a lot of money was wasted. What went wrong? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Jingkai District Urban Construction Company that built the road built it without approval. Of course, there were violations of laws and regulations. However, the road has been repaired, and it is indeed a road that has been long-awaited by the nearby people and is necessary to be repaired. However, if it is forced to be demolished, the problem may be even greater. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First of all this is a huge waste of public funds. Although the 120-meter road is not long, it costs a lot. The entire road is about 1 kilometer long and costs 60 million yuan. Calculating the cost of 120 meters is 6 to 7 million yuan, and dismantling it will also cost a lot of money. Once it was built or demolished, millions would disappear. This is a municipal road, and the Economic Development Zone Urban Construction Company responsible for its construction is also a state-owned enterprise. The source of its construction funds must be public funds of the local government, that is, public money. For Furong District, it is a good thing that the Economic Development Zone is willing to spend the money to build its own roads. If it is forced to be demolished and then rebuilt by oneself, although the cost of demolition will be borne by the Economic Development District Urban Construction Company, the cost of reconstruction will still be borne by Furong District. It is also incomprehensible to abandon existing roads that have been built with help from others and to dig up and spend money to rebuild them yourself. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Secondly, a section of the repaired road is dug out, and the rest becomes a dead end road. It took three years to build this road, and the nearby people had been waiting for it for three years. It was finally opened, but a section was demolished, and its effectiveness was greatly reduced. If we have to go through the formalities and rebuild it again, I am afraid we will have to wait at least another year and a half. This will bring great inconvenience to the public&#39;s travel and will also damage the local government&#39;s image in the public mind. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Requiring the Economic Development Zone to demolish the roads and then rebuild them themselves can be said to be harmful to Furong District and not beneficial to itself. So why do the relevant departments in Furong District do this? From the perspective of organizational behavior, perhaps one or two explanations can be given. For some departments, they must make the decision on their own territory. It is absolutely unacceptable for others to interfere with their boundaries without telling them. Even if you spend more money, you must maintain your authority. After all, if you want to spend money, it is also a financial expense, rather than having to pay out of your own pocket. Only consider issues from the perspective of one place and one department, from the perspective of maintaining the authority of the local area and this department, only consider legal compliance from the perspective of this department, and show your sense of existence. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As for whether the decision made is reasonable from a higher level, whether it will waste financial resources and state-owned assets, waste local taxpayers&#39; money and public interests and perceptions, and consume administrative credibility, it is not considered. scope. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This incident shows the fragmentation and lack of coordination among relevant government departments, the lack of appreciation for the use of fiscal funds, and the lack of care for the waste of state-owned assets. Such things are not uncommon. In the past few years, roads in some cities have been dug up frequently. Today they are laying water pipes, tomorrow they are burying wires, and the day after tomorrow they have to repair sewers. Frequently digging and repairing, repairing and digging again not only wastes construction funds, but also doubles the construction period and brings great inconvenience to citizens&#39; travel. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fortunately, after the media reports this time, the relevant departments of Changsha Furong District have urgently stopped the behavior of damaging the road surface, and have speeded up the relevant procedures to legalize the 120-meter road as soon as possible. This case has been solved. I hope there will be fewer such absurd things in the future. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 28 Oct 2023 20:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[“软实力之父”约瑟夫·奈：“中美间的交流应该是面向所有人的”]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259507]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-28 19:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Is there destined to be a war between China and the United States? My answer Yes, no.&quot; Joseph Nye, a professor at Harvard Kennedy School, gave a negative answer. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Joseph Nye is a representative figure of the neoliberal school of international relations. Before and after the Cold War, Joseph Nye was famous for proposing the concept of &quot;soft power&quot;. Soft power refers to a country&#39;s strength other than economic and military strength, and mainly refers to influence such as culture, values, and public opinion. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;He served successively as Assistant Secretary of State in the Carter administration, Chairman of the National Intelligence Council and Assistant Secretary of Defense in the Clinton administration. He is also a leading figure in American politics. But he reminded that the history of mankind is full of situations where wars &quot;accidentally&quot; entered. As long as China and the United States strengthen cooperation and act cautiously, wars can be avoided. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;China-US relations are one of the most important bilateral relations in the world today. On October 27, 2023, U.S. President Biden met at the White House with visiting member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and Foreign Minister Wang Yi. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Since October 23, Joseph Nye has embarked on his first visit to China after the COVID-19 epidemic. Judging from the public schedule in just one week, the &quot;Father of Soft Power&quot; has successively attended speeches at many think tanks and universities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On the afternoon of October 25, in the Qiulin Lecture Hall of the School of International Relations at Peking University, Joseph Nye spoke with the topic &quot;Are China and the United States destined to have a war?&quot; Hundreds of teachers and students discussed &quot;The History and Future of Sino-US Relations.&quot; The conference was jointly hosted by the School of International Relations at Peking University and the Institute of International Strategic Studies at Peking University. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Joseph Nye once proposed the &quot;20-year cycle theory of Sino-US relations&quot;, that is, since the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and the United States, the ups and downs of the relationship between the two countries have been based on a 20-year cycle. And change. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;In the long run, China and the United States will have better relations. But in the short term, China and the United States still have differences to resolve.&quot; Joseph Nye told the South Weekend reporter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Joseph Nye believes that after 2017, Sino-US relations entered a cycle of great power competition. &quot;China-U.S. relations have gotten worse in the past. In a sense, I think we have seen the deterioration of Sino-U.S. relations, but I hope things will get better.&quot; Joseph Nye told Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In recent years, discussions about the &quot;new cold war&quot; between China and the United States have been rampant in European and American public opinion circles. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In Joseph Nye&#39;s view, the Cold War between China and the United States is completely incommensurable with the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union. “During the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union, although there was military and political competition between the two countries, their economic and social ties were very sparse. But now China and the United States are highly interdependent in many fields such as economy, society, and ecology. ”&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In 2020, Joseph Nye wrote an article in the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; that the Cold War between China and the United States is completely avoidable. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Joseph Nye supports China and the United States in strengthening cooperation in public health, climate change and other fields. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Exchanges between China and the United States should be open to everyone. Exchanges at the cultural and scientific levels are equally important.&quot; Joseph Nye told Southern Weekend reporters that he hopes The public&#39;s attention should not only focus on high-level people, but also exert soft power. Low-level contacts are also very important. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;The following is an interview with Joseph Nye:&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Sino-US relations have gotten worse in the past. In a sense, we have seen a deterioration in Sino-US relations, but I hope things will get better. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Unfortunately, during the COVID-19 epidemic, communication between China and the United States has not been sufficient. However, communication between China and the United States has begun to change. The United States sent important cabinet members to visit China, and Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi also arrived in Washington for a visit. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;I think Sino-US relations are making progress. Two years ago, Sino-US relations were worse than they are now. What we&#39;re seeing today is some pickup, and I hope it continues. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;中美两国里，中国不仅有强劲的经济表现，还有传统文化的吸引力。我认为，国家的软实力不仅来自政府行为，也来自公民社会。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;美国政府经常做一些不受欢迎的事，但尽管如此，美国的公民社会仍然对其他人有吸引力，因为它相对自由。所以美国的软实力更多地来自大学、非营利组织、基金会，比如比尔·盖茨基金会。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;不可否认，近年来人们对美国的看法变得起起落落。我看来，美国的软实力有升有降。在越战期间、美军入侵伊拉克时，美国的软实力在下降。美国的软实力随着2008年奥巴马当选美国总统再次回归，又同2016年特朗普（成为美国总统）一起倒下。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;软实力不是线性下降或线性上升，它往往是周期性的。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;现在，由于美国国内的内部分歧，美国的软实力正在削弱。另一方面，如果你观察美国的硬实力，你会发现美国的经济正在蓬勃发展。美国是创新的源泉，在生物技术和人工智能等技术领域处于领先地位。再看今天的中东局势，（美国的）军事力量仍然非常重要。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;拜登政府执政三年了，（相比特朗普政府）拜登政府有一个更平衡的观点。他们依旧相信与中国合作仍有好处。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;今年5月，七国集团峰会将对华脱钩（decoupling），改为了对华去风险化（de-risking），这个表述意味着出G7国家对华将会采取部分脱钩，大多数是安全领域。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;换句话说，去风险化不是指彻底断开经济联系，而是有限制的。美国国家安全顾问杰克·沙利文将其称之为“小院子周围筑起高墙”。我们不应该让这个小院子扩大。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;为防止恶化，中美关系应该从高层接触开始。接下来再在中美间寻找合作领域，这可以向两国公众传达，与另一个国家合作是有益的。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;我认为，对于（俄乌冲突的立场）这是中国和美国可以加强合作的领域。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;中国和美国也可以在其他领域加强合作，比如气候变化、与世卫组织一同应对流行病等。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;中美间的交流应该是面向所有人的。显然，人们总是将眼光落在总统或者内阁身上。文化和科学层面的交流同样重要。如果我们需要（与对方）建立信任与合作，发挥软实力，低层级的接触是非常重要的。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;（中美关系）变得愈发复杂，很难在短期解决。我倾向于用“短期悲观主义者”和“长期乐观主义者”来形容中美不会彼此构成威胁。长远看，中美间会有更好的关系。但短期内，中美间仍有分歧要解决。 &lt;/p>;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;站在朝天门的高处，可以看到嘉陵江和长江交汇，这里是重庆最大的水码头。嘉陵江以南、长江北岸是长江滨江路，在这条现代街道上，坐落着重庆最大的批发市场聚集地——朝天门综合交易市场，它宛如一条飘带，流动着各地进货的人群，也流动着重庆的经济。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;山城重庆路陡平地少，特有的地势地貌，为棒棒提供了生存空间。“棒棒”为重庆方言，原意“棍子”，当地以此代称扛着一根竹棒从事重体力劳动的农民。在朝天门综合交易市场，棒棒们承担着这条经济链条上最后一环：搬运。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;如果你细细看，能从穿梭于市场各店铺的棒棒中找到零星几个女性的身影。她们剪着短发或盘着发髻，看起来老练通达，和主导这个行业的男人们仿佛没什么两样。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;她们有的单打独斗，有的开“夫妻档”。在出卖体力谋生的行业，她们常要应付雇主对其“业务能力”的质疑。但即便如此，她们也不愿丢下棒棒。&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“搬东西上坡最恼火”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;清晨6点的朝天门，江边货轮拉响汽笛，搬运车与柏油路摩擦发出的碰撞声，比重庆夜市还热闹。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;2023年9月30日，黄秀丽拉开窗，嘈杂声和阳光一齐透进房间。地板上搁着自腌酸咸菜和黄秀丽从各种地方搜刮回来的瓦楞纸箱子，桌上散落着饮料瓶和剩菜……这个弥漫着霉馊味的家，是黄秀丽一斤一斤挑出来的。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;黄秀丽已经有24年“棒龄”。一根棒棒，一条三米长的红色尼龙绳，外加一辆232元的小推车，就是她工作的全部助手。每天早上6点45分，黄秀丽准时到大正商场里“上班”，一边等单上门，一边和其他棒棒摆龙门阵。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;2023年9月，黄秀丽在搬运货物途中。（郑彩琳/图）&quot;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;刘油头答应每袋付30元，这是黄秀丽在朝天门市场能要到的比较好的价格。一袋309.6斤，直线距离324米——在2023年，黄秀丽出的力气平均一斤值9分钱。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;“划得着，一般都是十多块。”她担的大多是服装类货物，重量轻，相应价格也会低些。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;按照黄秀丽的经验，担货要动脑筋，不能莽起下力。为了减少空气阻力，她在拉货时呈半低头状；双手戴上手套，增加与推车之间的摩擦力。“搬东西上坡最恼火，一个人担（起），脑壳疼。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;早年在朝天门，回家的路上，黄秀丽存货单的挎包遭摩托车抢劫，“老子哪能忍，那是我的血汗钱。”为了保住钱，黄秀丽和摩托车较劲，导致上臂骨头移位，“花了好几千，医生也没给我治好”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;后来不知什么原因，黄秀丽的脚底板肿起来，睡醒了清早蹬地就开始痛。她自己琢磨扎针，抹药酒，结果越治越“恼火”。因此，黄秀丽喜欢挽起一半的裤腿，给小腿“放放气”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;碍于身体疼痛，黄秀丽挑起大体积重物上坡下坎时，都会侧身慢挪。一米多高的大箱子，黄秀丽会将绳子先展开挪到重物下，提起两头交叉捆起套在竹棒上，并在行走的过程中双手扶持货物。对于黄秀丽来说，身体不仅是工具，也是她的搭档。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;下午4点，朝天门批发市场各家商户都拉下卷帘门，黄秀丽在商场藏好棒棒和货车，回家做饭。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;上坡下坎时，黄秀丽不能用推车，需要纯人力搬运货物。（郑彩琳/图）&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/28/971d4f6708.jpeg&quot;

text-align: center;&quot;>;上坡下坎时，黄秀丽不能用推车，需要纯人力搬运货物。（郑彩琳/图）&lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;风水宝地&lt;/strong>;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;黄秀丽来自距离重庆主城区120公里的垫江，家里排行老幺，上面还有4个姐姐。在农村的时候，黄秀丽经常拖着姐姐大号的衣服去田里掰苞谷，收麦子，打谷子。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;即使在村里起早贪黑，黄秀丽挣的钱也只够应付自己吃。她决定去城里看看。离开垫江的前一夜，她去山里的竹林砍了两根竹子，心想以后就靠着这棒棒赚钱了。当天晚上，黄秀丽抱着棒棒睡了一晚，第二天关好门窗，直奔城区。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;黄秀丽1997年来到朝天门，那年她26岁，眼睛没有鱼尾纹，头发微卷黑亮，用一根黑色皮筋系住，精神干练。之所以来朝天门，因为这里是棒棒们发家致富的风水宝地。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;1991年，朝天门综合交易市场正式开业。到1997年，市场经营场地由最开始的6000平方米发展到27万平方米，经营户由500多户发展到10000多户。1996年，这里的市场年交易额达到30亿元。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;那时候，在棒棒聚居的朝东路，负责重庆璧山物流的彭莉，一天最高开到2万元以上的货运单子，“写到飞起，老子的关节疼死了”，彭莉痛并快乐着。刘油头一天的贸易额可以达到3万元以上，他形容自己的单子像火车拉煤看不见尾。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;高宗琦也赶上了这波“红利”。1990年代末，来自綦江的高宗琦和老赵，在老家种苞谷，第一年将货拿到城里卖，还没进城就被抢了一大半，亏了。第二年再拿到城里来卖，又亏了。听说在城里，帮人提东西也能赚钱，夫妻俩抄起棒棒，就来了朝天门。“我认不到字，跟在老公身边也安全些。”这一跟，就在朝天门跟了19年。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;每到年底，夫妇俩会得到一份老板发的1万元打包费，老赵笑称自己也是和白领一样有“年终奖”。他们靠着这笔“年终奖”应付回家过年的开支，高宗琦父母夸女婿有出息。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;赵东秋来到朝天门是为了儿子的媳妇本。三十年前，赵东秋与丈夫在四川安岳县开了一家零售店，虽然钱赚得比种地多些，但夫妻俩还是愁，何时能“闷”出一套房给儿子娶媳妇。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;后来和人聊天，得知当棒棒来钱快，夫妻俩在自家山里砍了两节竹子，用镰刀刮去竹肤，缠上胶带，绑上尼龙绳，连夜买了票，凌晨就到了朝天门。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;刚来朝天门，赵东秋一天的收入仅两元。但她不着急，背着索索（绳子）到处乱逛。四个月，赵东秋在朝天门逛出了自己的“人情社会”：哪家的女娃有好多岁，哪家婆娘命很苦，她了然于心，“我们要先熟悉圈子，别人才能喊到你，不然只能打白板（挣不到一分钱）”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;慢慢地，5元、10元……越来越多托运单进了赵东秋的腰包。2003年，棒棒的“起步价”为15元，赵东秋和丈夫最多一个月可以拿到1万元以上的货单。担货时，赵东秋经常穿着牛仔裤和一件三十多元的黄衬衣，脖子上戴一条细金项链。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;朝天门综合贸易市场的蛋糕越做越大，棒棒也越来越多。重庆大学2010年《山城棒棒军的生活状况调研》显示，最蓬勃时期，重庆约有40万棒棒，其中女性占比为3%。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;重庆朝天门综合交易市场，是大多数棒棒找活儿的第一站。（郑彩琳/图）&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/28/fd0d13ae52.jpeg&quot;

text-align: center;&quot;>;重庆朝天门综合交易市场，是大多数棒棒找活儿的第一站。（郑彩琳/图）&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;诗人傅维曾这样描述：在重庆，你的朋友喝醉了，可以请棒棒把他们背回去；女友过生日，可以请一群棒棒把花送去，还献上一首《生日快乐》歌；如果你的宠物遭遇不幸，可以请棒棒来帮哭……&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;虽能挣着钱，但棒棒们过得节省。刘嬢嬢和丈夫开着朝东路上唯一一家诊所，已经开了三十多年。刘嬢嬢印象中，很少有棒棒来看病，即使来了，也是开些头疼脑热的药，“他们舍不得钱。我开个一包一毛钱的阿咖酚散，他问我能不能再便宜点”。&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“老板喜欢找男棒棒”&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;女棒棒在朝天门不算受欢迎。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;高宗琦说，黄秀丽长得水灵，不像是干体力的。这样的姑娘，在朝天门棒棒里面没有市场。曾经有老板嫌她是个女娃，担不起活儿，黄秀丽就会顶嘴：“我担不起不要钱！”&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;“担得起又怎样？你一辈子是棒棒，我一辈子是老板。”伶牙俐嘴的黄秀丽听到这句话，就闭嘴了。出卖力气的棒棒，离不开老板的挑选。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;“老板喜欢找男棒棒。”这一行里头，体力意味着金钱。在朝天门批发市场，大宗货物的商场更青睐有体力的男棒棒。“他们一车可以赚五十多，我一单三十，滴滴嘎嘎（很少）的。”勤能补拙，黄秀丽只得多拉几趟。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;高宗琦很羡慕能担玩具的男棒棒，“钱多，一趟顶我（担）鞋子的三趟。”她1998年来到朝天门，在黄秀丽对面的新重庆朝天门国际鞋都担货。高宗琦也曾和老板商量，但老板下一次还是叫男棒棒。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;高宗琦也没气馁，老老实实打包自己的鞋子，“他们男的瓜西西的（傻的），可干不了这细活儿。”每次得知需要打包的数目，高宗琦就开始构思如何横平竖直地将鞋盒最大限度放进箱子里。塞紧了，影响卖相；塞宽了，箱子顶部封不上胶，可能还要浪费另外一个箱子。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;高宗琦打包的步骤像化妆：先横铺打底一层，第二层换个角度大面积晕染，最后再像填补痘痘坑一样，见缝插针塞几个规格小的鞋盒，最后封胶，系绳。高宗琦手起“刀”落，打包绳就一刀两断。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;“手比刀好用，但速度要快，不然要见血。”已经有25年“棒龄”的高宗琦总能快速找到绳子的分叉点，迅速将其拽断。长年重复动作，高宗琦食指的关节处多了一条沟壑。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;打包最后一个步骤完成，高宗琦还要负责“售后”，将店主剩下的鞋子摆放好，收拾好垃圾，再将货物拉到对面的驿站。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;高宗琦和丈夫一起打包鞋子。（郑彩琳/图）&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/28/004772f5a4.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;609&quot;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;女棒棒会遇到性骚扰。初来朝天门，黄秀丽和老高租房，搬入第一天，住对门的男棒棒见到黄秀丽，脱口而出：“多好的女娃啊！”便想去拍她屁股。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;“呸！老子即使没结婚，也不会和你耍朋友。一个嘴巴没把门，滚球去。”黄秀丽认为自己是直肠子，有委屈不能兜着。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;那个男棒棒不屈不挠，一天晚上9点，以搬运货物为借口，约黄秀丽出来。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;“老子信你个球，谁大半夜要运货？以后再拿老子耍，老子先把你耍了。”黄秀丽平时声音不大，但尖锐刺耳，稍微提高一个度，可以唬住一桌男棒棒。&lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;最怕担不到货&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;困难再多，黄秀丽也没想过不做棒棒，但挡不住行业式微。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;她记得很清楚，2008年汶川地震之后，朝天门的生意就撇掉了，“好多人都是川渝人，回家了。大家也没心思赚钱了，命要紧”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;“余震”延宕到2010年，朝天门批发市场面临提档升级、综合整治，好多商户都动了搬出朝天门的念头。“外头的生意撇了，来进货的少了。”刘油头回忆。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;物流公司兴起，快递上门的服务行业竞争愈演愈烈，加上重庆轨道交通四通八达，私家车兴盛，似乎一切都在争抢棒棒的“饭碗”。肩扛竹棒、沿街游荡揽活的棒棒越来越少。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;2021年，西北民族大学新闻传播学院发布的重庆棒棒生存现状调查估算，重庆的棒棒数量已不到2000人，且以老年人居多。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;高宗琦和丈夫合力搬运货物，途中遇到一个坡坎，路人一起帮忙。（郑彩琳/图）&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/28/330feb0e5c.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;608&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/28/330feb0e5c.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;255845&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;高宗琦和丈夫合力搬运货物，途中遇到一个坡坎，路人一起帮忙。（郑彩琳/图）&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;但高宗琦没想过转行。“我啥子都不会，只会出力。”高宗琦不识字，她觉得自己去做饭店的嬢嬢都会受到欺负，而且还要看老板的脸色，高宗琦不喜欢。她适应了不用“打卡”的上班。“棒棒自由，没得人管。担得起就担，不想做就休息。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;黄秀丽也不想回家。“女棒棒一个，看见熟人，不好说得话。”亲戚认为黄秀丽在城里当棒棒会受侮辱。“我没觉得啥子丢脸，但他们总觉得你有啥事情似的。他们咋晓得我搞了好多钱？”&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;黄秀丽想，能挣到钱就好，其余不算什么。“苦不打紧，最怕是担不到货，一天开天就要见好几百块钱。每次钱还没在口袋里捂热，就不见了。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;黄秀丽算了一笔账：一个月4000元房贷需要按时应付上；儿子正在读书，一个月800元生活费也不能少；女儿生了外孙，夫妻两人都没有工作，黄秀丽和老高每个月2000元供着。为了在商场中占据一席之地，黄秀丽还需每年给商场上交2000元“占地费”——占据15块瓷砖构成的7平方米地块，黄秀丽的儿子闲暇时就坐在那里边等妈妈边耍手机。加上水电物业和伙食费，黄秀丽觉得每个月需要8000元左右，家才能开张。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;每年的9、10、11月份是朝天门服装市场的换货季，往年也是棒棒们赚钱的黄金期。但今年，两三天之后就没有货担。按老赵的话说，现在打水的钱都打不赢。刘油头也下定决心回老家了。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;彭莉还是坐在路边的小板凳上，不过现在一天只能开两千多元的货运单。黄秀丽经常等下班的时候偷偷去捡瓦纸楞子。高宗琦还是每天6点坐在朝天门国际鞋都等货，早餐从两根苞谷变成了一根苞谷，“没得钱挣，不要白吃”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;棒棒少了，女棒棒更少了。南方周末走访发现，如今，在朝天门的女棒棒有8位，其中4位在新重庆朝天门国际鞋都担鞋子，1位在商储商场第三交易区搬衣服，还有3位流动在朝东路，主要搬运外来货物。在三峡广场的女棒棒有4位，其中2位经常在重庆新世纪超市门口等货，还有2位跟着丈夫到处拉货。在菜园坝公交站的女棒棒有1位，她旺季下午“收摊”，淡季担一早上就回去。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;被问及之前更多的女棒棒去哪里了，目前这块地区还有多少女棒棒，她们的答案都是“不知道”“不太清楚”。在其他棒棒聚集地如观音桥、白崖口街区、十八梯等，南方周末未发现女棒棒的身影。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;赵东秋早已攒够了儿子的媳妇本，但她依然不想离开朝天门。曾有人看上赵东秋的机灵劲儿，请她去算账，但赵冬秋谢绝了，“还是这里好耍些，可以和大家一起吹垮垮（聊天）”。赵冬秋现在给自己定的目标，是每天赚够100元就“下班”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;黄秀丽还是坚持每日外出找活儿。早上出门前，她都会在脚上抹上自制的药酒，相信自己的土方子比看医生管用。“生活难搞，但还是希望日子变好。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;（除赵东秋外，文中均为化名）&lt;/p>;

It was raining lightly in the early morning. Director Wei Shujun thanked everyone for coming to watch the movie before the movie started. He said that it was also raining in the first scene of the movie. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/92420c0a65a420316ddf9fdfdb6c6732.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;658&quot; height=&quot;923&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/92420c0a65a420316ddf9fdfdb6c6732.png&quot; data-key=&quot;255188&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The opening rain scene of the film takes us back to the southern town in the 1990s. The cold weather, dilapidated buildings, dim light, and cramped alleys, the space presented in the film The texture is distant yet familiar. A series of bizarre murder cases lead the pursuers of the truth into the abyss of madness. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;As a shortlisted film in this year&#39;s Cannes &quot;Un Certain Regard&quot; section, &quot;The Mistake by the River&quot; scored a high score of 3.5 points in the Cannes program&lt;/span>;&lt; span>;. As the opening film of the just-concluded Pingyao International Film Festival, this film once again received high praise from many film critics. &lt;span>;Since the short film &quot;Yanbian Boy&quot; debuted in Cannes in 2018, in just 5 years, every feature film directed by Wei Shujun has been favored by Cannes. Such excellent results are rare among the post-90s generation of directors. Its right. &lt;/span>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Wei Shujun’s first two works, &quot;The Parting of the Wild Horse&#39;s Mane&quot; and &quot;Stories of Yong&#39;an Town&quot;, have a very obvious personal color, not only in terms of plot, but also in the story. This kind of personal experience narration also includes a preference for meta-film narrative. Cannes&#39; favor is undoubtedly a recognition of Wei Shujun&#39;s creative talent and potential, but these two previous works are still young and immature. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/076b56ce199a61d4ff049d4328a9f286.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;725&quot; height=&quot;321&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/076b56ce199a61d4ff049d4328a9f286.png&quot; data-key=&quot;255186 &quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The &quot;Mistake by the River&quot; shows a self-contained temperament, marking Wei Shujun&#39;s maturity in creation. Of course, on the one hand, this is due to the original novels with more humanistic value and interpretation space provided by Yu Hua. On the other hand, it is also the more professional and skilled performance of the creative team under the control of industrialization and commerciality. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/bdd362b284cc8f585bda60da8f8bef25.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/bdd362b284cc8f585bda60da8f8bef25.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;255185 &quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;&quot;The Mistake by the River&quot; is a pioneering experimental novella, published in 1988, and is Yu Hua&#39;s early work. Yu Hua mentioned in the interview that Lu Xiaoya and Zhang Yimou both wanted to adapt this work, but neither of them came to fruition, which proves the difficulty of adapting this novel into a movie. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;When describing the creative process of &quot;Alive&quot;, Wang Bin mentioned that the first thing he recommended to Zhang Yimou was &quot;The Mistake by the River&quot; by Yu Hua. At that time, &quot;Alive&quot; Not fully published yet. After reading it, Zhang Yimou worried that the characters in &quot;The Mistake by the River&quot; were too symbolic. In the process of continuous discussion, Zhang Yimou also constructed an almost brand-new story, with more realistic characters and plots, and obviously more Zhang Yimou&#39;s style - this story has a female as the protagonist. It&#39;s just that this idea went nowhere. Zhang Yimou was later completely attracted by &quot;Alive&quot;, thus creating a classic in Chinese film history. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After more than thirty years, in the hands of a younger generation of creators, &quot;The Mistake by the River&quot; has taken on a new glory. Wei Shujun and screenwriter Kang Chunlei&#39;s adaptation has no concerns of the times or historical considerations. Baggage is a bold addition, deletion, disassembly and reconstruction based on the original work. It not only grasps the absurd nature of the original work, but also injects it with an expression that is closer to the current mental state. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/5fe8b80026b408a31f2ac5ae24f08669.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/5fe8b80026b408a31f2ac5ae24f08669.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;255190&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The pursuit of the truth in Yu Hua&#39;s original work is the author&#39;s analysis of madness and civilization during the cultural renaissance wave in the late 1980s. The protagonist Ma Zhe was eventually diagnosed as a &quot;madman&quot;. It is an ironic social naming. In the movie version, as Ma Zhe gradually becomes a madman, he encounters individuals being crushed by authority, the uncertainty of memory, and black humorous coincidences in the process of solving crimes. Near the end of the movie, a change of viewpoint in one shot shows that Ma Zhe has finally become a madman, and is even more proactive than Ma Zhe in the novel. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In that era in my memory, lunatics were common. Some liked to sing in the yard late at night, and some liked to tease others on the street. In today&#39;s era, we almost no longer see lunatics in public places, but more and more people entertain themselves as &quot;mentally ill.&quot; The different understandings of the symptoms of &quot;madman&quot; in the two eras may correspond to the different spiritual cores displayed by the two generations of creators in their treatment of novels and film texts. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/9d3a92c4251420384063fe14d67f7c51.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/9d3a92c4251420384063fe14d67f7c51.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;255189 &quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yu Hua said, &quot;Only fools are loyal to the original work.&quot; The movie &quot;The Mistake by the River&quot; is a smart and successful adaptation. The realistic texture created by Wei Shujun visually highlights the absurdity and the eerie atmosphere that makes people think deeply. The 16mm film shooting gives the film a retro tone, presenting the sense of small town space of that era, with occasional out-of-focus lenses, and even provides a stylistic expression for the theme of uncertainty. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The film&#39;s representation of the people and events in the unit of that era, as well as scenes such as the poetry meeting, is by no means a realistic reproduction. The director uses a slightly exaggerated satire, but more subtly conveys the reality of the times that makes people laugh. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Ma Zhe, played by Zhu Yilong, also provides a wonderful screen image for this retro realistic texture. In order to interpret this role more accurately, Zhu Yilong went to Nanfeng, the filming location, to experience life in advance. He found inspiration for his appearance from an old photo of Yu Hua, and first gained weight and then lost weight for this role. His experiential performance created an amazing character. A convincing image of Ma Zhe. So far, this role is the biggest screen breakthrough for Zhu Yilong, who is still labeled as a traffic star, and will lay the foundation for his future as a big screen actor. In other words, we see one thing from him: acting skills are more important than traffic. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/4d2519bd4e8e9a251834b9bc08856dba.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/24/4d2519bd4e8e9a251834b9bc08856dba.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;255187&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;&lt;span>;Wei Shujun, who prefers meta-movies, said that &quot;The Mistake by the River&quot; is no longer a meta-movie. &lt;/span>;However, in the film, a movie theater that is about to be demolished is used as the working space for handling the case. The gaze and being gazed created by the camera&#39;s perspective, as well as the presentation of the chaos of dreams and reality, all demonstrate the director&#39;s meta-cinematic interest. . &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Similar to the original work, &quot;The Mistake by the River&quot; has a detective-themed genre shell, but the direction of the plot and the author&#39;s stylized treatment broke the expectations of genre suspense. . Moreover, it also abandons the avant-garde nature of the original work and uses a linear narrative as the main line, but it is by no means in line with the public&#39;s imagination. Therefore, we need to look at the market performance of this movie with caution. But regardless of whether it&#39;s good or bad at the box office, this is a work with a unique temperament. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 28 Oct 2023 16:55:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[孙一钿：即将到来]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259484]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-28 15:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/25/lAsQWMSOeodnf7QCdK12dexC0WyrUcK0OvPbqZTe.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/lAsQWMSOeodnf7QCdK12dexC0WyrUcK0OvP bqZTe. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255445&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>; (Andrea Rossetti/Picture) &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among the &quot;post-90s&quot; who are active in the contemporary art circle, Sun Yidian is undoubtedly the lucky one who has a good hand. She is the kind of international artist favored by galleries and academic institutions. The creator is also the darling of fashion brands and the collection market. Her works involve painting, installation, performance, and fashion cross-border... In her twenties, not long after leaving the Central American School, she was named &quot;Outstanding Youth Under 30&quot; by Forbes Asia &quot;, and in the past two years, he has won the &quot;Young Artist of the Year&quot; from The Best of Best in 2022 and the &quot;Outstanding Creator of the Year&quot; from the Chinese version of the Wall Street Journal in 2022-2023. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2023 will be an intense year for Sun Yidian. She returned to school and studied for a doctorate in literature and art at Tsinghua University. She has continued domestic group exhibitions and overseas exhibitions. In April, she held a solo exhibition in Berlin. Portrait&quot; opens, followed by the solo exhibition &quot;Once Upon a Time&quot; in Paris on October 17th (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;&quot;Once Upon a Time&quot;&lt;/span>; ). Her iconic plastic dolls come from Western pop culture, but also contain Eastern codes. They have formed a unique accent in the old building of the landmark Place Fontaine in Paris: foreign viewers will smell the familiarity of the illustrations. A subtle touch of exoticism. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ph.D. supervisor Wang Minan once suggested that she complete her doctoral studies in a dual-thread approach: painting during the day and studying at night. But in fact, it is difficult to operate. &quot;Painting is still very brain-burning. After painting for a whole day, it is really difficult to read academic works at night.&quot; So she divided the time into different intervals: before the exhibition, she would retreat and paint intensively. , and then start the academic mode after all the paintings have been shipped. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/IPytwWYqQQjX4FS4Yis8WejWuPCzF83Bh8eRStto.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/IPytwWYqQQjX4FS4Yis8WejWuPCzF83Bh8eRStto.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255432&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;2018, &quot;A twinkle&quot;, Shanghai, BANK Gallery&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Wu Ren Studio in Beijing&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In September, Wu Hongce In the &quot;Crossing Boundaries - Possibilities and Echoes&quot; exhibition at the Yuz Museum, Sun Yizhen met again with her previous work &quot;Pink Dinosaur with Blue Wings&quot;, which was her work around 2017. The entire &quot;man-made object&quot; &quot;The representative work shortly after the series started, &quot;I have never seen it again after the exhibition.&quot; When I met face to face in the exhibition hall five years later, &quot;it was exactly the same as seeing a long-lost friend or child. &quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;You will recall the scene when you painted it, and even recall every stroke you drew. That moment was 3 o&#39;clock in the afternoon, and when you drew that stroke, the sun happened to shine. The place where you put down the pen, yes, suddenly, that memory was retrieved from your subconscious...&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The memories all came back in an instant, and a painting opened the door to the past for her. A wormhole, not only about that painting, but also a whole set of life wrapped up in that painting: At that time, she was still in graduate school, and she shared a studio in Feijia Village with her friends at the time. There was an artificial pond there. In summer, the pond is crowded with lotus leaves and lotus flowers, and people living around it are all engaged in art. The next door neighbor is a dancer and a photographer. They visit each other all day long, go fishing in the pond, and eat big pot rice: stewed turtle, spicy crayfish... …spent many lively nights, like a utopia. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is an elegy for collective life, which died out almost simultaneously with the student days. &quot;Now I have no collective life, only work is left.&quot; On the wall of the studio with small sketches, you can see the work Traces of madness: The exhibition schedule is accurate to every day, and is made into a list and posted in a conspicuous place; in an inconspicuous place, a whole row of &quot;45&quot; is densely written in pencil, and many of the &quot;45&quot; have been crossed out. ——This is the way good student Sun Yidian forces herself to focus on painting. She believes that every 45 minutes is a period of concentration. This is how the school&#39;s classes are set up. After every 45 minutes of serious painting, she will She crossed it out and allowed herself a small recess: she once liked using highly saturated fluorescent colors, which overloaded her eyes after long hours of homework and staring. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/BaVQHStk7Nt3jSUleSOHrwNw0XOXUbTuUiNWbfRY.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/BaVQHStk7Nt3jSUleSOHrwNw0XOXUbTuUiNWbfRY.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255434&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&quot;Crossing Boundaries: Possibilities and Echoes&quot; exhibition view, Yuz Museum, Shanghai, 2023&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Alessandro Wang, Yuz Museum/Photo )&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is Sun Yidian’s fifth studio in Beijing, and it is also the one she considers “the most luxurious”. The so-called luxury means that it has heating and air conditioning, and has a high roof, ceiling windows, which bring in stable natural light, and large-open doors to facilitate the transportation of large-scale works. The second and third floors are storage rooms and bedrooms. There is a shelf large enough to store her past works, and a bed where she can lie down when she stays up late to paint - this is all an easel artist desires. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Other studios before can only be described as crude and displaced. She would count them on her fingers: the first studio was in Ark Court, a residential building next to Central Academy of Fine Arts. The space and light were cramped, and it was impossible to display large paintings. The size of the painting was slightly larger, and the relationship between colors was inconsistent. The depth is just not right. The second one was in Feijia Village. It was a happy time, but it was demolished and a group of artists were driven away as if they were being expelled. The third studio was near the turkey factory. One summer there was a sudden flood and most of her paintings were soaked. So she fled there and moved to the mainland. The fourth studio has no heating in winter and no air conditioning in summer. She spent three winters in this ice cave, painting with her feet on a small electric carpet. Her hands became cold and stiff after a while, so she could only put them under her buttocks to warm them up before continuing to paint. Her mother came to see her from Wenzhou and felt the extremely cold weather that had never been seen in the south. At night, the surroundings of the studio were pitch black and there were no street lights. She couldn&#39;t help shouting: Daughter! What kind of sin have you suffered here? ! &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/XgzliM17Uhji4QMm2nlJC71KUgC9DGMrnP5WQ8VH.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;738&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/XgzliM17Uhji4QMm2nlJC71KUgC9DGMrnP5WQ8VH.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255448&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&quot;Once upon a time&quot; Acrylic on canvas, 205cmx158cm, 2023&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;A painting can be painted this way, or it can be painted that way&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Mother He was probably the first person to provide artistic support to Sun Yidian. When she was a child, her parents enrolled her in many interest classes. She was the child who cried when she saw she was about to play the piano, but she was very active in painting. She started studying painting at the age of 4. When she was in elementary school, her parents let her attend Wenzhou Youth Art School. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In other provinces in China, this kind of professional art school for primary school students is extremely rare, which corresponds to the strong demand for folk art education in the southeastern coast. These primary school students are cultivated by an almost omnipotent art concept. They have to learn Chinese painting as well as Western painting. Sketching, coloring, and sketching are all necessary basic skills. They have to go to the countryside to sketch, and they have to hand in calligraphy homework every week. &quot;Our primary school has actually trained many people. For example, the Asian Games torch was designed by our seniors, including architects and artists currently active in Zhejiang. If you ask, many of them came from this primary school.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt; p>;In the art circle, it is very strange to praise a person with &quot;top student&quot;, but Sun Yidian has indeed been a top student all the way. Her elementary school does not relax its requirements for cultural courses just because it majors in art. Many students will later go to ordinary middle schools and comprehensive universities, and not all of them may be bent on becoming art students. Sun Yidian was admitted to Wenzhou Middle School, the best local high school, but at the same time, she also received admission notices from the National High School Affiliated to the National Academy of Arts and the Central American High School Affiliated to the Art Examination. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/tlKnhoKUFJ4monMgkf7h5D6BTlFtFh8FzkurTiM0.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;732&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/tlKnhoKUFJ4monMgkf7h5D6BTlFtFh8FzkurTiM0.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255449&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&quot;Simple Shed&quot; watercolor on paper, 25.3cmx19.1cm, 2009&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She chose the High School Affiliated to Central Academy of Fine Arts because she could go to Beijing and legitimately &quot;leave&quot; Parents stay away.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For Sun Yidian, the High School Affiliated to Central Academy of Fine Arts is a free and magical place. She seemed to be suddenly opened up to a whole new world and new senses to match it. She is still amazed that she watched so many niche movies and so many esoteric books that were inappropriate for her age when she was in the attached middle school. &quot;There are many big boring movies that I can&#39;t stand now, but I actually watched them wholeheartedly at that time. Many of them In fact, I only know a little about philosophy books, so I just read them hard to pretend to be cool. People around me don’t listen to pop music. They all listen to very literary and niche things to show that they are different.” In the attached middle school, not being mainstream is a kind of mainstream. These hard-to-eat nutrients have unknowingly become part of her background. “The biggest inspiration for my art is that I am willing to try anything and be interested in everything. After a person is suddenly opened up at that age, he realizes , It turns out that a painting can be done this way or that way.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She still keeps a collection of sketches from when she was in the attached middle school. At that time, she had to submit a large number of sketches every week, and the teacher would write on the handed-in homework. The stamp indicates that it has been read, preventing students from submitting previous works for submission. In order to catch up on the huge amount of homework, they would go to Beijing Railway Station to stay up all night and paint the passengers who stayed at the station overnight. Foreigners from all over the world come in all shapes and sizes, and they don&#39;t move even after falling asleep due to fatigue. They are ready-made models at your fingertips. When she returned home during the summer vacation, while her mother was taking a bath, she was doing sketches of human figures. Her mother calmly let her do the painting without any hesitation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After graduating from the High School Affiliated to the Central Academy of Fine Arts, she was recommended to the Central Academy of Fine Arts. Her college entrance examination scores in cultural subjects were surprisingly high among art students. After graduating from Central America, he was directly recommended to graduate school at Central America. Sun Yidian said that she is the kind of person with strong self-motivation, and her academic career is just &quot;going with the flow&quot;. It was also out of self-consciousness that after working as an artist for several years, she went to Tsinghua University to study for a Ph.D. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/BGK6BCcuRR8Ks5wz3wSVfM4ulvO5VlLwx2jScva5.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;801&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/BGK6BCcuRR8Ks5wz3wSVfM4ulvO5VlLwx2jScva5.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255451&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&quot;Ken&quot; acrylic on wood, 45.5cmx38cm, 2019&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Natural objects and man-made objects&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Sun Yidian is well-known and has the best market performance The series is &quot;artificial objects&quot;, and most of the pictures are inflatable or plastic toys, but she also has a secret &quot;natural objects&quot; series, which she started to create when she was 16 years old, a series oriented &quot;from the deep&quot;, including flowers and fruits. , mountains, rivers, and trees have all become the objects of her gaze and representation. But the &quot;natural objects&quot; have never been exhibited. Sun Yidian hangs them on the wall of his studio, like a private archive. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Man-made objects&quot; are dazzling floats above the water, and &quot;natural objects&quot; are like anchors underwater. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Many people came to my studio and liked the &#39;Natural Objects&#39; series. Last time a sister came over and said that this group of small paintings made her cry.&quot; She incorporated a lot of elements into this series. For media experiments, I like to use some children’s handmade materials, such as a kind of baby foam beads called “pearl mud”, which can be used for shaping and is also a common raw material in toy factories. Later, I discovered a Japanese paper pulp clay that has excellent modeling power and durability, and can create a spatial effect similar to a bas-relief on the painting. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/RSyN0FWPkp9junVXBGZKFsIqxs7A2MxJSf78DO2v.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;639&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/RSyN0FWPkp9junVXBGZKFsIqxs7A2MxJSf78DO2v.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255450&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&quot;Let Me Hug&quot; Acrylic on canvas, 200cmx133cm, 2015&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Artificial Objects&quot; series made her famous in one fell swoop. The smooth, plump, grotesque and falsely sweet toys she draws have won her a steady stream of attention and collectors, and their prices have skyrocketed. As a child in Wenzhou, her childhood memories are all kinds of man-made objects. &quot;When I was a kid, when we said we were going to play at a classmate&#39;s house, what we actually meant was: go play in your family&#39;s factory.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Almost every household has a factory, including a shoe factory. , glasses factory, plastic products factory, lighter factory... Occasionally there are toy factories. There are not many toy factories, but the visual impact on a child is huge. These small commodity factories all retain a simple production layout. The factory building often has several bedrooms attached. The home is also the same as the factory. After the reform and opening up, materials, and the production brought about by materials, sprouted up everywhere in Wenzhou like bamboo shoots after a rain. What’s interesting is that her international collectors are also very sympathetic to these things she painted. They told Sun Yidian: The era when the artificial objects you painted suddenly exploded in abundance, maybe the 1990s in China. But in Europe and the United States, it was our 1960s. It is precisely because of this that they feel the same complex flavor of nostalgia and reflection in Sun Yidian&#39;s paintings. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This kind of commonality is not uncommon in Sun Yidian’s paintings, like a hidden cultural code. She paints huge idols. Their appearance and facial features are common in Western pop culture. However, the curved eyebrows and single eyelids come from traditional Chinese painting. The angle of the lips, which seems to be smiling but not smiling, is her classic image based on Buddhist sculptures. drawn. This image appears on the exhibition wall, facing the viewer in a overlooking manner. Regardless of whether the viewer is an Easterner or a Westerner, they will be slightly stunned and realize that something seems wrong in a sense of déjà vu. The &quot;Porcelain Mother&quot; she painted is a small white porcelain statue with hands clasped together, standing silently among the roots of the trees. This is a common porcelain Madonna ornament in Western families, but strangely, it also Much like the Dehua white porcelain Guanyin worshiped in Chinese households. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sun Yidian said that in her hometown, the belief system is complex. When she was a child, her family worshiped Buddha and worshiped Guanyin all year round. However, when she came to her uncle&#39;s house, he believed in Catholicism and kept a statue of the Virgin Mary in his home. As a child, she often felt confused. In her eyes, there was no essential difference between the kind and compassionate female faces. The localization of handicrafts has deepened this aesthetic mutual reference. A priest often came and went from her uncle&#39;s house. Apart from his detached and indifferent expression, she could not see any difference between the priest and ordinary neighbors. The same is true for local churches, which are European in form but with a strong Chinese decoration style. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She is keen to examine these common clues in different cultures out of curiosity about images. She painted Medusa and looked through Caravaggio and other classic paintings in the album. The snakes on Medusa&#39;s head were all live snakes. The artist had to focus on painting the twisting and entangled violence, lifelike, that is culture. Classic output to her symbols. In her private memory, Medusa only saw the logo on her mother&#39;s Versace bag when she was a child. She was surprised at that time. Why use the head of a strange woman as a label? In order to draw her own Medusa, she bought a bunch of rubber and plastic coiled snakes online as a reference. Their ferocity and beauty were just a bluff - &quot;I just wanted to draw them all as fake snakes, realistic fake ones.&quot; .&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Her workbench is filled with these artificial toys, which have also become the prototypes in her paintings: original Barbie, pirated Barbie, Ken with his head ripped off, naked Ken... The first time she drew Ken with only a head, she shocked everyone and triggered a big discussion including hot words such as &quot;feminism&quot;, &quot;female revenge&quot;, &quot;consumer men&quot;, and &quot;female reverse gaze&quot;, but she Frankly speaking, I painted my friend as Ken just for visual reasons, which is like playing house on the canvas. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/88ewe2kyK2hNwTUJjLor3sygbg00B5xHTLl3i9k8.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;956&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/88ewe2kyK2hNwTUJjLor3sygbg00B5xHTLl3i9k8.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255447&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&quot;Evening&quot; wood board composite material, 20cmx20cm, 2016&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The world is seven centimeters shorter&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Sun Yidian has always been interested in gender issues All are there. When she was in college, she asked acquaintances in her hometown to let her go to the obstetrics and gynecology hospital to observe women giving birth. It was the largest obstetrics and gynecology hospital in Wenzhou and the place where she was born. She saw groups of women rolling and moaning on the delivery bed. Their faces were blurred, and all their female characteristics were hidden. What mattered was the huge bulge in the middle of the body and the birth canal that was about to burst, as if that was their only thing at the moment. Biological attributes, their common identity and destiny. She turned this feeling into a series of works, titled &quot;Coming Soon.&quot; That year, she was 22 years old. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What is &quot;coming&quot; may be new life, or the adult life she is about to enter. But for Sun Yidian, &quot;coming soon&quot; is more like a moment in nature, &quot;In my hometown, there are many thunderstorms in the south, the kind of heavy rainstorms that suddenly fall, and the sky is so dark that the day seems like night, The raindrops were huge, pouring, and then there was lightning and thunder. I have many such memories when I was a child. I stood under the window of my house and looked at the heavy rain outside. The sky suddenly lightened up, and then there was a burst of thunder from the distance. . My &#39;coming soon&#39; is the moment when the lightning has flashed and the thunder has not yet come. I am nervous and scared, but I am also looking forward to that moment coming.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She did not explain her scene, no matter how It’s up to the viewers to draw their own interpretations, whether it’s gender issues, pop culture issues, material issues, consumerism issues... She is at ease with everything. Just like her painting &quot;Porcelain Mother&quot;, those who believe in Guanyin see Guanyin and the Mother of God. What the viewer sees is the Virgin. She believes that any viewing will first reflect the viewer’s cultural memory and information reserve, rather than the creator’s intention. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As her doctoral thesis was about to be started, Wang Minan suggested that she write about consumerism. The implication was that it was related to the topic she drew, and it would be easier for her to gain insights when writing. She also thought it was reasonable. She is just worried that her logical ability is not strong - the academic construction of writing a paper and the picture composition that she is so familiar with are completely different things. Teacher Wang sometimes asks her from the perspective of &quot;consumption&quot;: I heard that one of your paintings has sold for millions? She was so frightened that she only waved her hands: Teacher, teacher, let’s never talk about this. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/UfQY7vrtFQzxgrxEuiFVap805CGeMwvUOhSpJIQB.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/25/UfQY7vrtFQzxgrxEuiFVap805CGeMwvUOhSpJIQB.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255446&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&quot;Porcelain Mother&quot; Acrylic on wood, 54cm x 45cm, 2023&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhang Ailing said that you must become famous as early as possible. Sun Yidian agreed with both hands, but her reasons were different from Zhang Ailing. What she worries about is not that success comes too late and the taste is not sweet enough, but she believes that becoming famous at a young age can give people a valuable sense of relaxation and allow them to do art more calmly and comfortably. Those artists who have been tortured by fate for too long and have struggled to overcome all kinds of struggles are sometimes inevitably distorted by the desire for success and the pressure of survival, leading to deformed movements and making incredible choices. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Only the income from selling paintings in my first exhibition was meaningful to me, because it meant that I could support myself and become an independent artist. Before that, I had always followed My parents were vaccinated and asked to be mentally prepared that I might not have a job after graduation and would have to go home to grow old. That money gave me great freedom. The happiness from money ended here. After that, I sold Any high price offered is just a number to me.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She naturally realized that as long as the female artists of her generation made some progress in their careers, they would inevitably work for all women. speak out. &quot;When a female artist becomes famous at a young age, it is easy for others to say: Is it because of your appearance? Is there someone behind you who is helping you raise the price?&quot; Is it impossible for women to achieve success based on their strength alone? Is it hard to acknowledge the excellence of women? Sun Yidian&#39;s way of fighting back is to use more comprehensive self-strength to shut them up. This is the self-confidence she built up as a top student from childhood to college, and it is also one of the motivations for her to return to school to study for a Ph.D. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among the many sketches nailed to the wall of her studio, there are several sketches of powerful high-heeled shoes. The toes of the scarlet high-heeled shoes are joined together and formed into two separate heels. The shape of the female pelvis. Sun Yizhen always remembers a poem by a Taiwanese male poet that he read when he was a girl. He wrote about the feelings of girls when they wear high heels - &quot;The world is seven centimeters shorter.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sun Yidian is 1.72 meters tall. He wears 7cm artificial high heels and is taller than many men. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In a world seven centimeters shorter, she continued to move forward. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;（图片致谢艺术家、BANK画廊和施博尔画廊柏林/巴黎/首尔、余德耀美术馆）&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;获取更多RSS：&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 28 Oct 2023 15:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[“潇湘”作为地名传进日本，竟然是因为一位禅宗大画家的加持？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259334]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-28 14:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Not long ago, I had a gathering with two old friends. During the dinner, I accidentally talked about the misfortune of Nie Er, the composer of &quot;March of the Volunteers&quot; The place of drowning - the coast of Shonan in Fujisawa Prefecture, Japan. Wang Zhongyi, the editor-in-chief of &quot;People&#39;s China&quot; magazine, asked me about the relationship between Shonan and Naito Hunan and Hunan Province. I knew what was going on but didn&#39;t know why. I was questioned on the spot. So, after returning home and doing some homework, I came up with this fake &quot;place name test&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/26/iAnaBLpu5DQSiWI3mbKe9wYDfzszNsGMp2b7u9wI.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;891&quot; height= &quot;1185&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/26/iAnaBLpu5DQSiWI3mbKe9wYDfzszNsGMp2b7u9wI.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255549&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Japanese Sinologist Naito Konan (1866-1934). &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(data map/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Let’s talk about the latter first. The relationship between Naito Hunan and Hunan Province is simple, so simple that there is no half-cent relationship. Naito&#39;s halo as a sinologist is so dazzling that when Chinese people talk about this legendary figure, they often make associations: the &quot;Hunan&quot; in Naito&#39;s name must have been &quot;taken&quot; from Hunan Province, and it is intentionally or unintentionally reminiscent of When it comes to the &quot;theory of cultural center movement&quot; and the &quot;theory of changes in the Tang and Song Dynasties&quot;, it seems that if you don&#39;t even &quot;roll&quot; your name, you can&#39;t be called a great scholar. However, Japanese intellectuals are mostly limited by the concept of regionalism and take it for granted. Since he is a leader of the Kyoto School, the name &quot;Hunan&quot; must come from Hunan City in Shiga Prefecture adjacent to Kyoto Prefecture, but this lake is not Dongting Lake, but Lake Biwa. In fact, neither of these two arguments is correct. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Naito Hunan&#39;s name is Tiger Jiro, whose courtesy name is Bingqing and whose nickname is Hunan. 1866年，生于陆奥国马毛内村（今秋田县鹿角市十和田马毛内）。鹿角位于秋田县的最北端，与青森县之间隔着界湖“十和田湖”，“湖南”即十和田湖的南边之意。十和田湖是由十和田火山喷发而形成的二重式火山湖，风光旖旎，是东北地方的名湖，作为特别名胜列入“国家文化财”。在东京都中心的国会议事堂，环绕中央大厅四周的墙上，悬挂着描绘日本列岛四季风景的巨幅油画。其中，夏季的作品即田中仪一所绘《十和田湖与奥入濑》。如此，因了内藤湖南和京都学派的影响力，原本八竿子打不着的湖南省硬是被扯出关联，连全无干系的滋贺县湖南市也被附会了与内藤的某种连结，而内藤生长的故土十和田湖，却偏偏不被世人提起了。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/26/Wvjin72u69Lnqd8pGj5ChHbXG2N2MlN21dU2dMKS.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;580&quot; height=&quot;403&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/26/Wvjin72u69Lnqd8pGj5ChHbXG2N2MlN21dU2dMKS.jpg&quot;

&lt;p>;再聊回前者。关于湘南与湖南省的关联，其实并无定说。 《广辞苑》（第五版）对“湘南”的释义虽有所指涉，但语焉不详：①位于中国湖南省、注入洞庭湖的湘江以南一带风景名胜地的称谓。 ②将古相模国南部的“相南”，附会①而写成“湘南”，作为对相模湾沿岸地带的称谓。那一带包括叶山、逗子、镰仓、茅崎等区域，夏季多海水浴场，是京滨的避暑地，冬季则比较温暖。作为住宅用地，被广泛开发。如“湘南电车”，系连结东京和（静冈县）沼津的中距离旧国铁的总称。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;通过这条释义，我们了解到，没有中国的湖南，便没有日本的湘南。接下来的一个问题：这种空间上的“链接”到底是何时以及如何发生的？在日本，“湘南”的表述最早见于平安时代中期的辞书《倭名类聚抄》（简称《和名抄》或《倭名抄》），语源是长沙国湘南县。据《资治通鉴大辞典》（吉林人民出版社，1994）的解释：湘南县为“西汉置，治所在今湖南湘潭市西南。东汉改为湘南侯国。三国吴复为湘南县。南朝齐废”。不过，《倭名抄》中的“湘南”，仍是单纯的中国古地名，并不等于今天日本的“湘南”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;各种证据表明，湘南真正的“越境”，与禅宗有关。葛兆光先生在《中国禅思想史》中谈到，南方禅学在地理上分两支，其中的第二支，便是“以荆州、衡岳为中心的禅师集团”：&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;如荆州天皇寺的法懔、法忍，长沙寺的法京、智远，襄阳景空寺的法聪，庐山法充等。当然，最重要的是先在光州大苏山，后至衡岳，开后来天台一脉的慧思（515—577）。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;而天台宗，正是对日本佛教、禅宗产生了决定性影响的教派。公元804年，最澄禅师作为遣唐使入唐学法，翌年回国后，在比叡山（别称天台山）的延历寺传法，继而创立了日本天台宗。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;宋末元初的画僧牧谿法常（法常是法号，生卒年不详），少时曾在名僧无准法师门下修禅，后成为西湖六通寺的开山祖师。其画作于镰仓时代末期（14世纪），随中日禅师的交流，批量流入日本，顷刻受到上流阶层的狂热追捧。那种用水墨晕章和大量余白来表现乾坤幽趣的技法，高超圆熟，是日人眼中文人对自然山川之理想国“憧憬的象征”（日本学者山下裕二语），也深刻影响了日本的南画。桃山时代日本画宗师长谷川等伯、表屋宗达等人，都曾向牧谿画作中寻求水墨画技法的根本；狩野派艺术中也有很多临摹牧谿的作品。牧谿的画，是日本公卿、大名和富商争相收藏的对象，是国宝中的国宝。如室町幕府足利家族所藏绘画珍品的记录《御物御画目录》中，全部280件庋藏中，牧谿作品占三成，多达103件。在14世纪中期的日本文献中，如只写“和尚”的话，便是对牧谿的尊称。牧谿的画在中国几近绝迹（仅故宫博物院和台北故宫博物院各藏一件），据说日本现存134幅，均藏于内阁府文化厅和全国一流美术馆的珍品库中。而牧谿作品的“天花板”，公认是《潇湘八景图》。全八卷中七卷在日本，余下的一卷《山市晴岚》，至今所在不明，日本保有摹本。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/26/Cpej7mByBiUAd7Aqq2Ejiw6c3nmf2eEu7a3P27DL.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;3197&quot; height=&quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/26/Cpej7mByBiUAd7Aqq2Ejiw6c3nmf2eEu7a3P27DL.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;255548&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;牧谿法常《潇湘八景图》之《渔村夕照》。 &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（资料图/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;所谓“潇湘”，《辞海》的释义为：①湘江的别称，因湘江水清深得名。 《山海经·中山经》：“交潇湘之渊。”《湘中记》：“湘川清照五六丈，是纳潇湘之名矣。”又或专指湘江中游与潇水会合后一段，即“三湘”之一。 ②泛指湖南地区。郑谷《淮上与友别》诗：“数声风笛离亭晚，君向潇湘我向秦。”③古镇名。五代时置，在今湖南永州市西北。因当潇湘二水合流处得名；亦称潇湘关或湘口关。据此而顾名思义，“潇湘八景”即湘江并入了潇水后，一路向北的湘江沿岸至洞庭湖一带的八处佳胜。北宋以降，代有画家以之为题创作，寄情山水，“潇湘八景”几成一种艺术范式。著名者有宋迪作同名画卷，后被沈括写入《梦溪笔谈》，分别为远浦帆归、平沙落雁、烟寺晚钟、山市晴岚、江天暮雪、洞庭秋月、渔村夕照、潇湘夜语——“八景”的名目，自此“出圈”。不过，与宋迪等人的作品相比，日人显然独钟牧谿。至于个中缘由，哲学家韩炳哲认为：&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;牧谿受禅宗启发创作的《潇湘八景图》，也是“空”之图景，笔墨简淡含蓄，一片空无，意境幽玄，寥寥数景隐没于无限疏阔的余白中，谨慎的笔法让物象浮动在实与虚、黑与白之间，不道尽其中意蕴。物象相融相依，彼此映照，而非驱离、分割彼此。空仿佛成了友善的中介。水住，山流，天地合。空寂并未将画中静物湮没，而是反衬出静物之雅。 （《禅宗哲学》，第35页）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;如此，从镰仓时代到江户时代，从足利将军家族（足利义满、义政）到织田信长、丰臣秀吉，从德川将军家族（德川家康、吉宗）到松平不昧、村田珠光，牧谿的《潇湘八景图》在这些人物之间流转，其价值已不能用金钱来估评。日人实在是太爱“潇湘八景”了，恨不得移景于日本。果然，后来日人在武藏国仓城郡六浦庄村（今京滨急行电铁的金泽八景站）一带，“发现”了“金泽八景”——整个是“潇湘八景”的“箱庭”版。妙就妙在每处佳胜，竟与潇湘的原风景一一对应，且被歌川广重搬上了浮世绘，计有《乙舻帆归》《平潟落雁》《称名晚钟》《洲崎晴岚》《内川暮雪》《濑户秋月》《野岛夕照》和《小泉夜语》，共八幅。元禄7年（1694），从大明亡命东瀛的东皋心越禅师为“金泽八景”各题汉诗一首，有了中国大儒的七言绝句背书，金泽俨然潇湘矣。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;据说江户时代初期，泽庵和尚把江之岛一带开始称为“湘南”。同一时期，室町时代从中国移居日本的中国人后代、小田原的祛痰药商崇雪，在大矶的鴫立庵建一石碑，碑上刻“著尽湘南清绝地”七字。此碑今犹在，被视为湘南地名的起始。而近代之前，汉学始终是日本的显学，故出于某种文人趣味也好，或说附庸风雅也好，用“湘南”作雅号的禅僧、诗人所在多有，如禅僧湘南淙、诗人大久保湘南等。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;湘南电车通车后，被称为“湘南”的区域进一步扩大，连三浦半岛都被归入其区划。明治29年（1896）5月，德富苏峰为双亲在逗子海滨购置一栋别墅，然后把照料二老的任务交给弟弟德富芦花，自己便踏上了周游世界之旅。彼时，芦花正身心交瘁，对放浪生活感到厌倦，决定暂去父母的别墅隐居，同时考虑未来的进路。他在致胞兄的信中写道：“东京的空气，对我来说太冷了。我想在湘南住些日子。”彼时的湘南，已成为上流人士的住宅区。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;也是差不多同一时期，夏目漱石和铃木大拙各自在位于北镰仓的圆觉寺跟随禅师释宗演参禅。漱石参禅是为自我疗愈，而大拙则为了学法。时空交错，二人的目的既不相同，也未相遇。从镰仓幕府时代起，因幕府统治者得宗家族的庇护，禅宗得以在此地生息、发育，历经五个世纪的发展，及至漱石和大拙禅修时，已蔚为大观，镰仓这座古刹林立、禅意十足的古城，也成了如假包换的禅宗“麦加”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;就这样，从牧谿法常的《潇湘八景图》到“金泽八景”，从泽庵和尚到亡命东渡的中国禅师，可以说，正是因了禅宗的加持，这个以江之岛为中心、沿相模湾向东西延展的狭长的海岸地带，才从古地名的“相南”变成了今天世人眼中的“湘南”，自带一种迥然不同于其他地域的浪漫风情。譬如，住在首都圈的人，周末开一辆挂“湘南”车牌的车，跑在134号国道上，哪怕只是一台再普通不过的轻型机动车，也不失为一件拉风的事，车牌的“含金量”甚至碾压东京都内高级住宅区“品川”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;（原题“何处是湘南”，现标题为编者所拟）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 28 Oct 2023 14:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[学术期刊为何能收那么贵的版面费？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259320]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-28 13:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;近日，湖北省一会计类期刊《财会通讯》发布通知称，对养育三孩家庭的作者免收版面费。这本来是一个非常小众的学术期刊，通知本身能够触达的人群也比较少，但还是迅速在网上引起了热议。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;引起热议的原因，可以归结为这么几个方面：首先是一篇文章六七千元的版面费，价格并不便宜；其次是这个期刊的定位，由湖北省会计学会主办，湖北省社科联主管，收取高价版面费给人感觉更像是一种商业行为；最后才是这个优惠措施，调子起得很高，实际上受益人群可能寥寥无几，几乎可以忽略不计，给人感觉这更像是一个促销活动。几个因素叠加，成为热点也就不奇怪了。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;虽然我一直知道在学术期刊发论文要收版面费，但是一篇文章收费这么高，多少还是有点意外。从其官网上看，最新一期目录上有31篇文章，这个期刊是半月刊，就按每篇文章6000的版面费来计算，他们每月的收入就可以达到372000元，一年就是4464000元。一份期刊近500万的年收入，这妥妥的是一门好生意啊。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;其中很重要的一个原因是，最近几十年全球都在“高等教育大跃进”，以及背后伴随的“论文通胀”。中国因为人口基数大，经济发展速度快，这方面的问题尤其突出。只不过参与其中的大都是“文化人”，或多或少都是其中的“受益者”，即便是看到了问题所在，也不会轻易去戳破这层窗户纸。毕竟看破不说破，也是一种广为人知的生存智慧。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;学历通胀背后，是本科生、研究生、博士生的扩招。而各大高校对论文数量的看重，基本上都会要求研究生毕业之前发表相应数量的论文，通常越好的学校对论文层次的要求也就越高。每年都会有学生因为没有完成论文的发表而申请推迟毕业，论文发表对研究群体来说就是一种刚需。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;另一方面，本科、研究生的扩招，必然伴随着教师数量的扩招。而在整个教育系统，都有着对发表论文数量考核的传统。老师职称晋升、申请科研项目或者申请各种科研基金，都有必须发表论文的硬性规定。而且不仅是大学里边对论文有要求，就是中小学现在也有要求。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;不光是教育系统，还有的比如医院，甚至一些不是科研机构的单位，也会把发表论文数量作为是否晋升的一个重要考察指标。其中一个考量，大概是因为这样看上去显得很公平。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;另一个考量则是某种意义的“学术崇拜”，或者说“科学崇拜”，就好像发表论文就是为科学学术作出了贡献。实际上长期以来，我们很多地方和高校都在奉行和宣传“唯专利和论文数量论”，论文和专利数量一直都是他们宣传的重点。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;今年8月初，日本文部科学省的研究所发布一份报告。报告显示，中国论文总数占全球份额的24.6%，比第2位的美国高出8.5个百分点。而在衡量论文质量的引用次数上，中国“受关注论文”和“顶级论文”的全球占比分别为28.9%和29.3%，也都是世界第一。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我们倒是不必妄自菲薄，把这种数据排名看得一文不值。客观地看，一方面这个数据说明，中国的科研学术影响力正在逐步扩大，这是好事。但另一方面，我们也要看到，这种数量和现实之间的反差。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;我们常说“量变引起质变”，但是当论文和专利数量被错误的激励制度扭曲的时候，量变未必能够导向高质量的质变。相反，更可能会导致低层次、低水平的重复，还会产生一些奇葩的“学术研究”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;比如前几年某学术期刊刊登了《通过靶向肠道菌群调控人体的物质需求欲望有望提高廉政文化建设效率》。这类文章还有很多，完全是不加掩饰地搞“伪学术”，完全是为了凑数去的。在不当的激励制度下，论文发表成为了很多人的刚需，而且是一个非常大的“市场”。需求旺盛，而供给有限，刊物就那么多，版面就那么多，所以基本上形成了一个“卖方市场”，版面费要高价也就不奇怪了。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;高价暴利之下，一定会有更多的人参与其中，于是这就形成了一条“论文产业链”。有写手、有中介，有人负责出钱、有人负责刊发，各种渠道，你只要出钱基本上都能找到。当然，这个“市场”并不是完全自发的，而是畸形的激励制度催生的。而且这种畸形之下，很有可能还会滋生腐败。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2017年，湖南省社会科学院《求索》杂志社原主编乌东峰因严重违纪问题被立案审查。问题正是出在版面费，后来经法院认定乌东峰收取的论文“版面费”共近千万元。在《求索》杂志发表一篇论文的“版面费”最高达到5万余元，还有中介机构专门负责勾兑这些事。当时这个案件引起了学术界很大震动。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;除了这类腐败案件和问题外，“论文产业”还有个问题，那就是“虹吸效应”。这条“产业链”上的人本来是应该去创造财富了，结果却沦为“论文掮客”，帮助别人发表毫无价值的文章来获利。而有的版面费是公费报销的，除却那些真正有价值的文章，恐怕大多数垃圾文章，本质上都是很多人在“合谋分赃”，其中某些人恐怕就是在瓜分纳税人的钱。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;想要改变现状，恐怕不是头疼医头的问题。不是要问为什么版面费这么高，而是要问，为什么那么多没有价值的期刊和文章，竟然还能活得那么滋润。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;

&lt;p>;&lt;span>;“emo”来自英文单词“emotion”，这是情感、情绪的意思。在20世纪90年代，欧美流行音乐领域里出现了“emotional hardcore”，这是一种情感细腻、忧郁感伤的摇滚音乐。在简化为“emo”后，emo也就有了冲动、敏感、忧郁等色彩。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;如今作为流行词汇的emo，延续的正是这一内核与情感色彩，代表了年轻人一种颓废、沮丧、无语、纳闷的心情。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;emo成为流行词汇，不仅仅是因为“语言经济学”原则——这个短小的词汇很精准地概括了年轻人的心态，也不仅仅是流行词汇传播中的“羊群效应”——你用他用于是我也用，还在于，emo确实是一种普遍性的时代情绪。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;emo是以前流行的“佛系”“丧”“躺平”等流行词汇的新变体，它背后关联着时代的一些新变化。比如后疫情时代，全球经济恢复缓慢，经济下行周期，年轻人的工作压力更大了。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;“内卷”之下很多人感到非常疲惫；忙碌的都市生活中，很多年轻人没有太多的时间去社交，下班了就待在出租屋里，成为“空巢青年”的他们难免感到孤独寂寞冷……除了这些普遍性的困境外，年轻人在各自的人生中也有不同的、具体的困惑，多多少少影响着年轻人的情绪。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;总之，年轻人万事皆可emo。找不到工作，emo了；工作压力大，emo了；跟对象闹矛盾了，emo了；单身没对象，emo了；考试没准备，emo了；方案被甲方毙掉，emo了……&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;跟丧、躺平等词汇相比，emo带有一丝苦中作乐的自嘲意味，它没有那么消极悲观，而是在吐槽“我真是emo”了之后，仍然会收拾好生活的烂摊子，继续前行。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&lt;span>;“情绪价值”的抚慰&lt;/span>;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;emo之后，仍然要拥抱生活。所以，年轻人会努力地让自己的情绪更快地平复，让自己的情绪需求得到满足，他们会寻求“情绪价值”。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;那么，什么是情绪价值？简单地说，情绪价值=积极情绪（收益）-消极情绪（成本）。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;一件东西、一个人是否拥有情绪价值，就在于TA能够给人带来正向的情绪力量，比如让人感到快乐、安心、平静、温暖、治愈……换言之，情绪价值是一种能够给我们的情绪带来正向影响的能力。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;它可以是陪伴，是分享，是倾听，是鼓励……最终都变成对emo情绪的一种抚慰。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;社交媒体上，年轻人也经常使用一些与情绪价值密切相关的词汇，比如“情绪稳定”，这成为很多年轻人挑选伴侣的第一标准。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;一个情绪稳定的伴侣，遇到事情总能平静沉稳处理，不失控，不甩锅，不相互责怪，而是努力去解决问题。伴侣情绪稳定，自然也就能给人带来强大的情绪价值——你会被一种安全感包裹，不论世界如何慌乱，都有人与你携手走过。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;这样的背景下，我们就能够理解为什么很多年轻人在互联网上购买情绪了，他们实质上购买的是“情绪价值”。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;如果一个人学习没有动力，就加入“虚拟自习室”，大家一起学习更有氛围；如果想要一种好运的幻觉，就购买“好运锦鲤”；如果想要摆脱孤独，获得一种陪伴感，可以下单一份“虚拟蚊子”，会有卖家角色扮演蚊子，不定时“嗡嗡嗡”地来“吵”你；分手后买一份“骂醒恋爱脑”，与其说是真的骂你，毋宁说是陪伴你、跟你说话、听你倾诉。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/27/66f81e258e4ce4cd84843e25edeb22f7.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;794&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/27/66f81e258e4ce4cd84843e25edeb22f7.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;255731&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span>;（IC photo / 图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;不是想买就能买&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;人们都喜欢能够提供高情绪价值的人和事，这是人之常情。敏锐的商家也抓住了这个商机——年轻人需要情绪价值，我就来贩卖情绪价值。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;问题是，情绪价值真的是想买就能买吗？ &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;如果情绪价值是如此轻而易举就能够获得的东西，它也就不会如此稀缺了。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;诚如前文所言，情绪价值是一种“能力”，它要真正击中你emo的点，带给你力量，给到你抚慰，帮你跨越那种消沉的情绪。这不是你在对话框里一通输出，对方说几句心灵鸡汤，就可以实现的；不是你买了“好运锦鲤”或“爱因斯坦的脑子”，你就如有神助，好运就从天上掉下来了；也不是对方“煽动情绪”，你就情绪解放了……&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;所以，互联网上那些几毛钱、几块钱出售的“情绪”，出售的只是一个噱头，出售者并不具备提供情绪价值的素养与能力，他们甚至比一些商家的客服更套路、更敷衍。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;年轻人购买的也只是几分钟的新鲜感，给emo情绪带来几分钟的乐子，新鲜感一过，该emo还是得emo，问题没解决的话还是没解决。把“情绪买卖”当作调侃可以，较真了可能会上当受骗，让你更加emo。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;说到底，如果没有人或事可以依靠，那么能够给自己带来正向情绪价值的，就只有你自己。你如果长时间没学习，觉得自己堕落了，你会感到emo，你认为加入“虚拟自习室”会给你带来动力。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;实际上，如此的他律也是形同虚设，如果你多一些自律，每天完成定下的目标，完成的那一刻你会感到真正的快乐——越自律越自由；你如果平时不努力，考试前就会感到emo，你认为购买“好运锦鲤”就会好运，可考试时你不会还是不会，如果你努力学习、专心备考，你的付出会在考试中体现，你收获的是真正的踏实感与成就感……&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;情绪价值终究不是想买就能买，购买情绪当个乐子可以，可走出emo不能只靠精神胜利。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 28 Oct 2023 12:25:03 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
