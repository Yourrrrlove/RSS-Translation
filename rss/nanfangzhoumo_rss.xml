His original plan was to just flip through the information and quote a few pages from the book. However, after reviewing a large amount of literature, Flynn was surprised to notice that Americans&#39; performance on IQ tests continued to improve over time: According to records from 1932 to 1978, the average American IQ increased in 46 years scored 13.8 points. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The apparent increase in IQ scores over several generations seems unlikely to be caused by genetic evolution. Flynn therefore suspected that this must be caused by changes in environmental factors, meaning that IQ is influenced more by the environment than by genetics. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To test his conjecture, Flynn expanded his research to 14 countries, including all races. The results found that IQ scores in 14 countries have improved over time over the past half century. Among them, East Asia has the fastest growth, and the average IQ in East Asia is higher than that in Europe and the United States. The IQ of humans around the world is increasing over time. This discovery was called the &quot;Flynn effect&quot; by later scholars. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Flynn himself believes that there are no genetic differences in intelligence between races, and that intelligence is affected by environmental factors such as education, economy, and social culture. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since then, various countries have followed up and conducted studies, all of which have confirmed that the Flynn Effect does exist. However, by the end of the twentieth century, the Flynn Effect suddenly failed in developed countries. Statistics from the University of Vienna in Austria found that between 1962 and 1975, the growth rate of average IQ slowed down significantly; and between 1975 and 1991, it directly stagnated. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At first, scholars thought this was a normal phenomenon: the average IQ in developed countries may have reached the upper limit and will no longer increase with the improvement of education and medical care; but the IQ in developing countries is still rising, and finally Countries will reach a level close to each other. However, as I continued to record, I found that the average IQ in developed countries has not stagnated, but has begun to regress! &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2016, a joint survey by Finland and Denmark found that since the mid-1990s, the IQ test scores of recruits in the two countries have been declining at an average annual rate of 0.25%. In fact, as early as 2008, a British scholar discovered that the average score of 14-year-old British teenagers on thinking tests at that time was only equivalent to that of 12-year-old children in 1976. They believed that &quot;the intelligence of British young people has regressed greatly. It is almost certainly due to the popularity of televisions and computer games, as well as too frequent exams in schools.&quot; But this reason is far-fetched. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The famous scientific journal &quot;Nature&quot; published a paper in 2016: A research team discovered a gene that is highly related to academic qualifications. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;They first studied high-educated people and low-educated people, and found that there was a significant frequency difference in this genotype between the two groups. This genotype was then used to predict the future education level of the child, and the results were verified more accurately. Exactly how this genotype affects brain development remains unclear. However, another large study of more than 100,000 people in Iceland showed that this gene may affect the age of childbearing, thereby indirectly affecting the level of education. However, how it affects the age of childbearing is still unknown. It is very likely that Still an indirect effect. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, regardless of the mechanism of action, the research team discovered a serious problem:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This genotype has been eliminated from generation to generation among Icelanders. In other words, the educational level of the new generation may continue to decline. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Because people with a high level of education will delay the age of marriage and childbirth, the number of children will decrease, and they will even end up not getting married and having children, and they will eventually eliminate themselves. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although analyzed on a ten-year basis, the influence of genes is still very small and almost negligible: the continuous decrease of this &quot;reading gene&quot; among Icelanders is speculated to cause the average IQ of Icelanders to drop every ten years. The annual decrease was 0.04. If all genes related to education conform to this rule, then this number is only 0.3 - which seems to be nothing compared to the improvement in IQ brought about by acquired environmental improvements such as education. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, environmental improvements such as universal education have limits. The elimination of genes from generation to generation is eternal, so that the research team also warned: &quot;If this situation continues for centuries, the consequences will be very serious.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This research in Iceland has not yet been carried out. It has been verified in other groups, but the problem suggested by the study is very general:&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Humans around the world, especially those in areas with higher education levels, are likely to face this problem - it seems that smart people are constantly Self-elimination. Of course, the concept of &quot;higher education level&quot; seems to require further analysis: is it longer years of education, higher academic qualifications, or both? Is it the values ​​instilled in them during their education that affect their desire to have children and their fertility rate? This requires further research. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ba1010;&quot;>;•&lt;/span>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti; font-weight: bold;&quot;>;（ This article is only the author&#39;s personal opinion and does not represent the position of this newspaper)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 21 Oct 2023 13:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[为A股做空制度打补丁，限售股融券制度为何引争议？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258955]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-21 12:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Amid the storm of public opinion, regulators patched the A-share short-selling system. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 14, 2023, the China Securities Regulatory Commission announced that it would gradually tighten securities lending and strategic investor placement share lending. Securities lending is currently the most important short-selling system in the A-share market. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Previously, the newly listed company Jindi Shares (603270.SH) was the subject of intense public controversy. On the first day of listing in early September, Jindi shares were shorted by large amounts of securities lending. Later, after verification by the China Securities Regulatory Commission, the loaned shares came from a company&#39;s core employee management plan, commonly known as the &quot;strategic investment plan.&quot; Because they are held by insiders, these strategic investment shares are usually regarded as &quot;restricted shares&quot;, and their biggest feature is that they are not negotiable. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Science and Technology Innovation Board was launched in 2019, allowing some restricted stocks to be included in the scope of securities lending, and will be fully implemented on the main board in 2023. The original intention of the policy is to &quot;bring down&quot; the price of new shares by expanding the source of securities and strengthening the power of short selling. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, even if all the shares of the above-mentioned asset management plan were lent for short selling, Jindi shares were still issued and listed at a high price-earnings ratio of nearly 84 times. The closing price on the first day increased by more than 121 yuan compared with the issue price of 21 yuan. %. However, the stock price fell by nearly 30% in the following two weeks. Not only did securities lending fail to curb speculation in new stocks, it was also blamed by investors as the culprit of the decline. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Similar situations are not uncommon in new stocks. Southern Weekend reporters used financial statistics from Caihui. As of the last trading day in September, 66 of the 189 listed companies that had IPO&#39;d this year had lent their shares through strategic investment plans on the first day of issuance, changing &quot;restricted sales&quot; to &quot;tradable&quot;. &quot;. More than half of them have a price-to-earnings ratio of more than 50, which is a high-priced issue. Kweichow Moutai, which has the largest A-share market value, has a price-to-earnings ratio of only 32. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many interviewees told Southern Weekend reporters that the contradiction does not lie in the securities lending business itself, but in the fact that the scarce securities sources are concentrated in the hands of a small number of people, resulting in no securities to borrow in the market, especially for new stocks. Even more so, because most of the securities are locked in the restricted shares of the original shareholders. We originally wanted to use the securities sources of strategic investors to solve this problem, but this resulted in the restricted shares in the hands of major shareholders being circulated in disguise, and the policy &quot;fighted&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When short selling can only be participated by a small number of people, the supply and demand of securities sources are out of balance, and the inflated issuance price makes short selling a profit-free transaction, the price discovery function of A-share IPOs cannot be said to be effective. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/20/gmI5x7bPY8ZlBNBJIduTMJzG8XDVyCpzWSM2ZBBy.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1267&quot; height= &quot;845&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/20/gmI5x7bPY8ZlBNBJIduTMJzG8XDVyCpzWSM2ZBBy.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254697&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The listing of Jindi Shares triggered a controversy over strategic investment in restricted stocks and securities lending. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;“Since it is a restricted stock, why do we need to let it circulate?&lt;/strong>; &lt;strong>;”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;How to characterize the strategic investment and asset management plan of Jindi Shares is the main disagreement in the market. “No issues such as detours by relevant entities to reduce holdings or collusion in conveying benefits were found,” is the conclusion of the China Securities Regulatory Commission after verification. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The essence of borrowing is to bet on the subsequent trend of stocks. Once the stock price falls, investors can buy the stock in the market at a cheaper price and return it to the lender. The difference between the borrowed stock and the actual purchase of the stock is the investor&#39;s profit. The cost depends on the interest paid to the lender, that is, the rate. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The above-mentioned securities lending of 4.7 million shares of Jindi Shares was divided into 7 financings, each with a term of 27 days, and the number of financings were 390,000 shares (financing rate 21.6%), 1.413 million shares (fee) 22.6%), 160,000 shares (23.6% fee), 2.477 million shares (24.6% fee), 20,000 shares (25.6% fee), 80,000 shares (27.6% fee), 160,000 shares (24.6% fee), 160,000 shares (27.6% fee), rate 28.1%). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Yuan Yuwei, a senior hedge fund manager currently living in Paris, told Southern Weekend reporters that the annual rate of 28% is relatively high in the current market. “The price of each ticket changes every day and is not fixed. As a rule, the larger the ticket, the cheaper it is. The lowest rate can be around 5%, while small tickets are basically between 5% and 10%, and there are also 20%.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The executives of Jindi Shares are lending the restricted shares in the above-mentioned asset management plan to investors in exchange for interest income on the securities. The higher fee rate means that the market is flocking to the source of the stock. In other words, there are many investors who want to short the stock price of Jindi, and the stock price may be artificially high. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the Jindi Shares announcement, the number of strategic placements is 4,700,871 shares, accounting for 8.58% of the issued number. It is called Jindi Shares Asset Management Plan (including Plan 1 and Plan 2), with a sales restriction period of 12 months and a total amount of 102.3 million. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What surprised Yuan Yuwei was that the source of the stock&#39;s securities was the shareholding of core executives. According to the company law or securities law, these restricted shares, whether held directly or through an asset management plan, can only be sold after the lock-up period. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is also the focus of controversy for Jindi Shares. In the stock forum, which has more than 480 pages and nearly 38,000 shareholder discussions, more than half are asking the same question: Is the refinancing of Jindi Shares reasonable? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Since it is a restricted stock, why let it circulate? The major shareholders even earn interest (rate) by doing so, which is strictly prohibited abroad because it violates the rights of the secondary market. Rights.&quot; Yuan Yuwei said that in the U.S. and European capital markets he is familiar with, restricted stocks mean that they are not tradable. Not only the buying and selling of stocks, but also the profit from restricted stocks are strictly restricted. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is also the focus of this regulatory adjustment - &quot;Adjust and optimize the securities lending system&quot;, &quot;cancel the lending of special asset management plans established by executives and core employees of listed companies through participation in strategic placements, and moderately restrict other strategies Investors’ lending methods and proportions in the early stages of listing.” &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;The price of new shares is artificially high, is it possible to lock in profits through securities lending? &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;It is not uncommon for stocks to have similar operations to Jindi Shares. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to statistics from Southern Weekend reporters, 66 of the 189 listed companies that have IPO&#39;d this year have lent shares through the Strategic Investment Plan on the first day of issuance, with a total amount of 5.932 billion. If ranked by the amount of securities lending, Jindi shares ranked fourth among 66 listed companies with 221 million. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Similar to Jindi Shares, Surbana Security (688651.SH) suffered more than 90 million yuan in securities lending on its first day of listing on July 26. The company responded to investors by calling it &quot;a strategic Investors lend”. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The market’s doubts about Jindi shares are not unreasonable. Since there is a serious information asymmetry between the actual controllers of listed companies and ordinary investors, the restricted stock system can tie the interests of directors, supervisors and senior executives to those of listed companies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Information asymmetry may lead to the problem of controllers running away in advance. That is, after the company goes public, the business situation deteriorates and the performance changes dramatically, and they throw the mess to the market. This phenomenon occurs in A The stock market is not uncommon.&quot; Huang Jianzhong, a former investment banker and associate professor of the Department of Finance at Shanghai Normal University Business School, explained to Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He pointed out that if directors, supervisors and senior executives are allowed to cash out in advance, the above situation will become more serious. Therefore, under the current registration system, not only the interests of major shareholders are required to be bound, but also the sponsoring securities companies must also participate in the investment. The essence is to serve the interests of the bound listed companies and securities companies, and make the securities companies responsible for running away early. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In February 2023, the China Securities Regulatory Commission issued relevant systems for the full implementation of the registration system, and the refinancing business was further liberalized. It not only broadens the scope of underlying securities and lenders, but also adjusts the original &quot;fixed term, fixed rate&quot; model to a market-based declaration method. Lenders and borrowers can independently negotiate the refinancing term, rate, extension or early settlement. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The major shareholder of Jindi Co., Ltd. joined the scope of refinancing lending through its identity as a strategic investor. According to the latest data from the Securities Finance Corporation, there are currently 3,293 listed companies on the Shenzhen and Shanghai stock markets that have entered the two financing lists. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“If a listed company simply borrows securities, it cannot be considered to be reducing its holdings, because its operation process is for the listed company to give the securities to the securities and finance company, and the securities and finance company to the securities and finance company. The company will then be financed by the securities company to the investors who borrowed the securities. After two hands were passed in the middle, different securities will be mixed together, so it is difficult for the lender to reduce its holdings through manipulation.&quot; Professor of Peking University Law School and securities law expert Peng Bing explained to Southern Weekend. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is also the focus of regulatory verification. It is guaranteed that Jindi shares and the final investors are not related transactions, excluding the possibility of cooperative arbitrage. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What Huang Jianzhong is more worried about is that the prices of new shares are generally artificially high, and major shareholders of listed companies cooperate with external institutions to carry out arbitrage. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;The stock price and price-to-earnings ratio of Jindi Shares are relatively high. If the issuance of new shares is accompanied by a refinancing policy, there may be problems in order to meet listing requirements and support high valuations, thereby packaging performance. Actual Controller They know the actual situation of the company best. If they lend stocks, it involves insider trading. If the performance changes after half a year, the hidden problem will be even greater.&quot; Huang Jianzhong said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Peng Bing is also worried about this. &quot;Because major shareholders understand that the inflated stock price will eventually fall, they circulate restricted shares in the market to lock in the profits from the borrowing part in advance.&quot; At this time, the price of new shares increased. The higher the value, the more beneficial it is to major shareholders, because more people will borrow securities to short-sell after the listing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although the policy gap opened by refinancing does not make it possible for major shareholders to directly reduce their holdings, it may increase the motivation of major shareholders to falsify their performance, because even if the stock price of the restricted shares in their hands falls, the major shareholders You can still lock in some profits in advance by lending stocks through refinancing. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Allow some people to short-sell first&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;? &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;According to Peng Bing’s observation, the average premium level in the US primary and secondary markets is between 10% and 20%, but the price of domestic new shares can double or triple on the first day. &quot;In the past, the phenomenon of A-shares flocking to speculate in new stocks was largely due to the stipulated price-earnings ratio of 23 times. Under the registration system, pricing was relaxed but the speculation was still hot, which is not normal.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A report from Huachuang Securities shows that as of September 24, the total turnover of the A-share market in 2023 was approximately 159.3 trillion yuan, and the sales volume of securities lending was 943.3 billion yuan, accounting for approximately 0.3% . From 2019 to 2022, China&#39;s securities lending balance/total market value increased from 0.02% to 0.11%. However, compared with the United States, the total securities lending balance is still significantly lower. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The main means of checking and balancing stock price speculation in the United States is short selling. The A-share securities lending system also has the same effect, but the effect is not obvious. Part of the reason is that the supply of securities sources is insufficient, resulting in an imbalance of long and short forces. Only a few people to participate. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Commission income and interest on securities borrowing are the main sources of income from the securities lending business. The greater the customer&#39;s transaction volume and the higher the transaction frequency, the higher the securities firm&#39;s income. Brokerages are naturally more willing to lend their securities sources to private equity funds and quantitative funds that use high-frequency trading strategies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Customers who have opened the two-financing business can directly inquire about coupons from the brokerage firm where they opened an account, but not every customer can get the coupons. &quot;The first is to look at the transaction size, and the second is to look at the turnover rate.&quot; Feng Ruifeng, who works in the self-operated department of a large securities firm in Shanghai, told Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Take Feng Ruifeng’s securities firm as an example. In addition to opening a margin account, he is also required to hold more than 3.5 million yuan in trading funds before he can lock the securities, that is, the underlying securities source is locked in advance, and the rate is based on the securities source. The specific situation will be determined later. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The greater the stock price fluctuation, the higher the fee rate. Because the policy allows securities lending to conduct T+0 transactions without overnight positions, for those stocks with large price fluctuations, the T+0 strategy is naturally The more room for profit there is, the more people will borrow bonds. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This time, Golden Emperor shares were lent to 35 individual investors and 89 private equity funds, with the number of institutions far outnumbering individuals. Feng Ruifeng judged that in addition to the 89 private equity funds, the other 35 individual investors are most likely hot money predators with funds comparable to small private equity funds. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is not uncommon in A-shares to pay a high price but still not get the coupons. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;In the U.S. stock market, as long as there are securities in the market, I can basically get them if I pay for them. I have almost never encountered a situation where I can&#39;t find a source of securities.&quot; Yuan Yuwei said frankly that if the brokerage firm where he works does not have a source of securities, , you can also find other brokers for lending. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are also differences between China and foreign countries in terms of the limit on the number of accounts to be opened. The two financing accounts are used for credit transactions, and there is a certain proportion of leverage. In order to control investors&#39; trading risks, current regulations stipulate that a single investor can only open a credit account with one securities company. Yuan Yuwei told Southern Weekend reporters that there is no restriction on this in the United States. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The threshold for retail investors to open margin trading and securities lending accounts is also quite high. According to the &quot;Administrative Measures for the Margin and Securities Lending Business of Securities Companies&quot; issued by the China Securities Regulatory Commission in 2015, &quot;the average daily securities assets in the last 20 trading days are not low.&quot; &quot;500,000 yuan&quot; is the primary condition for opening a margin financing account. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, data from China Securities Settlement shows that as of the end of August this year, the number of personal margin financing accounts opened in A-shares was 6.6126 million, and the number of individual investor accounts in A-shares during the same period was approximately 221 million. Those who can participate in short selling Retail investors only account for 2.99% of the total. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Because the securities source pools of each securities firm are not the same, if the securities firm where the customer opens an account does not have the securities source he wants, and the customer cannot open an account with other securities firms for securities lending, this will objectively increase the risk. It makes it more difficult to borrow money. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;A&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Stock sources&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Why are they scarce? &lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;At present, the source of securities for A-share securities lending transactions mainly comes from securities firms’ own stocks and refinancing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The number of securities firms’ own stocks is quite limited. &quot;This part of the securities source is basically for large customers, and customers who have deep business relationships with securities companies generally get priority.&quot; Feng Ruifeng said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Refinancing is currently the main source of securities by borrowing securities from other institutions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, compared with overseas markets such as the United States, A-share securities sources lack two important sources - individuals and major shareholders of listed companies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After U.S. stock investors sign an account opening contract with a securities firm, they will be prompted whether to activate the &quot;Stock Income Enhancement&quot; function. To simply understand, it is to lend the stocks in the personal account to short sellers in the market and obtain Interest. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Most investors in the United States will sign this contract, which to a certain extent expands the source of securities borrowing and also enhances the liquidity of individual stocks.” A senior executive of a foreign hedge fund Chen Kaixuan told Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After lending to the market, although the stock will fluctuate in the short term, it will not affect the long-term trend, and investors can also earn additional interest income. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The more important source of securities comes from major shareholders, that is, restricted stocks. This is also the main source of bonds in the U.S. capital market, but it is subject to strict restrictions on holding reductions in the country and has not circulated in the market. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A former regulator told Southern Weekend reporters that if restricted shares are fully circulated, the problem of stock supply will be solved. After the market is fully valued, new shares will no longer be scarce, and the actual controllers of listed companies will not be able to pass The number of new shares of a company is artificially controlled to artificially increase the price. But on the other hand, it will also break the myth of A-share speculation, thereby affecting the premiums in the primary and secondary markets. &lt;br>;&lt;br>;“Only by maintaining a high premium for IPO listings can the new stock issuance market have a large amount of funds gathered in the ‘new’ place.” He said that full circulation obviously has a destructive effect on the price of new shares. Once the price of new shares in the secondary market is lowered, it will further reduce the price in the primary market and the value of the shares in the hands of early investors. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Why are there no sales restrictions on U.S. stocks?&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;“In the United States, the main method of corporate governance is to decentralize and dismantle the control rights of listed companies. The more dispersed the ownership, the less investment in small and medium-sized enterprises. People&#39;s protection is often better. Rather than restricting the sale of the actual controller&#39;s shares.&quot; Zhang Wei, deputy dean of the City University of Singapore Law School, told Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The U.S. stock market also has a sales restriction system. The biggest difference from A-shares is that it is not a regulatory order, but the result of a game between brokers, exchanges and listed companies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Chen Kaixuan’s institution is a strategic investor in multiple listed companies. He explained that this system is called a lock-up period. Generally, the actual controller of a listed company and a securities firm sign a business agreement. There are restrictions on the sale of holdings between 90 and 180 days after the company goes public. The reason is also to prevent the original shareholders from immediately reducing their holdings and cashing out after listing, causing the stock price to fluctuate sharply. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission) does not require listed companies to sign a restriction agreement, but it has formulated regulations to explain which shares can be called restricted shares and exceptions to the restriction . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The legal basis for the U.S. sales restriction system is called Act No. 144, which specifically stipulates the implementation details of the sales restriction and divides restricted stocks into two categories: restricted securities and control securities. , the former mainly involves private placement issuance, and the latter refers to the stocks in the hands of the actual controller of the company, and is also the target of the A-share sales restriction system. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Controlled securities are the so-called &#39;old stocks&#39; in China. The SEC only restricts underwriters (brokerages) from short selling within 30 days after the IPO. They generally also subscribe for a part of new shares, but for investors through their own There are no restrictions on the lending of stocks by brokers.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;144 actually stipulates which restricted stocks can be circulated in the market with exceptions. For example, the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq are 6 months. After the 6-month lock-up period, the number of shares that shareholders can sell every three months. It cannot exceed 1% of the issued shares of the same type or the average weekly trading volume within four weeks, whichever is greater, and must be reported to the China Securities Regulatory Commission in advance. There are special regulations for corporate executives, directors and other insiders who are aware of inside information. If they reduce their holdings by more than 500 shares or the transaction volume exceeds US$10,000, they must report to the China Securities Regulatory Commission. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhang Wei explained that there are certain misunderstandings about Decree No. 144 in China. In the U.S. stock market, the focus of supervision and prevention is insider trading. Regulation 144 has designed a channel for the circulation of a series of restricted stocks. &quot;The so-called here The restriction does not prohibit resale, but requires registration in advance. What US law regulates is not the &#39;reduction&#39; of company controllers, but the transfer of stocks without (re)registration, requiring them to make public disclosures.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is not uncommon for the actual controller to sell off immediately after listing. For example, in Alibaba&#39;s IPO, old shares accounted for nearly 62% of the total issuance.

In 2015, a Korean brokerage company took the lead in cartoonizing the images of entertainment stars and making cotton dolls, which became a support item for fans. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Afterwards, cotton dolls became widely popular in the fan circle, and fans began to DIY cotton dolls based on their idols, which could be used as support items or as collections for fans. idol peripherals. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;After that, Cotton Dolls spread from the Korean entertainment industry to our country and developed completely new. Domestic cotton dolls not only exist as fan products, they have also formed an independent track - many &quot;baby mothers&quot; design unique cotton dolls themselves, start groups on the platform, and then let manufacturers make them after the group is successfully formed. After the goods are delivered, the &quot;baby mother&#39;s&quot; journey of raising a baby begins. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Using the classification of baby circles, cotton dolls are divided into two categories: &quot;with attributes&quot; and &quot;without attributes&quot;. &quot;Having attributes&quot; means having prototypes, or celebrities, or some authorized film and television characters. They are more products of the fan economy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;No attributes&quot;, that is, there is no prototype. The cotton doll is the original creation of the &quot;baby mother&quot; and can be &quot;customized&quot; according to her own preferences. The domestic cotton doll circle is dominated by cotton dolls with &quot;no attributes&quot;. Many young people &quot;raise cotton dolls as babies.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The &quot;Cotton Beauty Doll&quot; Weibo Super Chat, established in 2019, now has more than 1.46 million &quot;baby mothers&quot; and more than 3.7 million posts. Read More than 28 billion times. The super chatty posts are mainly about cotton dolls with “no attributes”. According to the &quot;2021 Cotton Dolls Player Insight Report&quot; released by Weidian, the main trading platform of Cotton Dolls, in early 2022, among the army of Cotton Dolls players, the post-00s generation accounted for the highest proportion, reaching 43%, followed by the post-95s generation, which ranked second. Reaching 26%, the online transaction volume of Cotton Dolls exceeded the 1 billion yuan mark that year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;It can be said that cotton dolls have formed a spectacular subcultural phenomenon. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/20/ZwnTwoNo1EJJ17WDBbQr3mWMky2SR5TfFDQSfCSe.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/20/ZwnTwoNo1EJJ17WDBbQr3mWMky2SR5TfFDQSfCSe.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;254710&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（IC photo/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; >;&lt;strong>;The healing feeling of “raising a baby”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Generation Z users account for 70% of Cotton Doll players. Why are the younger generations obsessed with it? A cotton doll? &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;As far as those cotton dolls with &quot;attributes&quot; are concerned, they are mainly an extension of the rice circle culture. For example, cotton dolls based on idols are like the incarnation of idols, which can satisfy fans&#39; emotional projection. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;But for those DIY, &quot;attributeless&quot; cotton dolls, the fun lies in the emotional healing of &quot;raising as a baby&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Although those DIY cotton dolls have different facial features and shapes, they have one strong thing in common, they are very cute. &quot;Cute&quot; is mainly used to express those people, things and things that can inspire people&#39;s extremely strong and profound emotions, including liking, admiration, being fascinated by them, persistence, excitement, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On the one hand, everyone has the love of &quot;cute&quot;. Austrian zoologist Konrad Lorenz put forward the idea of ​​&quot;larval retention&quot;. He pointed out that it is human nature to like anything with larval characteristics, and these cute animals have big eyes, big heads, short noses, etc. Characteristics, which can also explain why young children, kittens, and puppies are more likely to arouse people&#39;s affection. In the same way, cotton dolls that retain the characteristics of juveniles are very kawaii, full of cuteness, and enchanting. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On the other hand, &quot;cute&quot; has an emotional healing function. From a psychological perspective, a series of things that are non-aggressive, peaceful and non-controversial, can soothe the soul and give people a continuous and long-lasting sense of comfort, can help people resolve sentimental emotions such as loneliness and depression. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The process of &quot;raising&quot; cotton dolls as babies by the young Generation Z is like the emotional investment of the little prince in the rose in &quot;The Little Prince&quot;. The little prince put up a screen for the rose, covered it with a glass cover, got rid of the caterpillars, and listened to her complaints. He devoted time, emotion and energy; the same goes for every young man who raises cotton dolls, buying clothes and clothes for his own dolls. I changed clothes, confided my feelings to him, took him to travel everywhere, took him to Haidilao to celebrate his birthday...&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Like a rose to the little prince It is unique, and every cotton doll that receives the emotional investment of the &quot;baby mother&quot; is also unique to the &quot;baby mother&quot;. Therefore, it is normal to not understand the young people who brought cotton dolls to eat Haidilao in the news, but there is no need to rush to ridicule and deny them. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;It is also worth mentioning that unlike many subculture products whose prices remain high, the prices of cotton dolls are often very affordable. Some &quot;non-attributed&quot; cotton dolls cost between tens of yuan and a hundred yuan, and baby clothes will be more expensive, but &quot;baby mothers&quot; can also buy their own fabrics and DIY, which is the fun of many &quot;baby mothers&quot;. The popular healing system has contributed to the further popularity of cotton dolls. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/20/EUBdRoG12f2usOU3EaPTW5rC8JcQQXcw191ZHCjB.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/20/EUBdRoG12f2usOU3EaPTW5rC8JcQQXcw191ZHCjB.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;254711&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（IC photo/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; >;&lt;strong>;Specialization is the way out&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Compared to industries such as blind boxes and figures, the market space for cotton dolls has yet to be Dig further. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The current cotton doll track is mainly divided into two types: &quot;with attributes&quot; and &quot;without attributes&quot;. The new trend in the &quot;attributed&quot; track is that more and more regular troops are joining. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Previously, many &quot;attributed&quot; cotton dolls were privately created &quot;secondary creations&quot; by fans, wandering on the boundary of infringement, such as not directly saying that they were infringement. A certain star or an image in a play is the prototype, but the fan base knows that it is the prototype. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Nowadays, many film and television producers take the initiative to use cotton dolls as part of their derivatives, officially producing cotton dolls with &quot;attributes&quot; for sale to the public. Not only new IPs have launched Cotton Dolls, such as the previous &quot;Shanhe Ling&quot;, &quot;You Fei&quot;, &quot;Canglan Jue&quot;, &quot;Menghualu&quot;, &quot;Hunting Crime Illustrated Book&quot;, etc., some old IPs have also come to share the pie, such as &quot;The Legend of Zhen Huan&quot; &quot;&quot;Pleasant Goat and Big Big Wolf&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;For the emerging market of cotton dolls, this kind of formalization is necessary. It can not only expand the circle, but also help to mature the cotton doll industry chain. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Currently, &quot;attributeless&quot; cotton dolls are still the mainstream, and their business model is mainly &quot;DIY design + spontaneous group building + small amount of customization&quot;, which is essentially Small workshop model. The top priority of this model is to improve the specialization of every link in the cotton doll industry chain. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Small workshop does not mean shoddy manufacturing and petty fuss. For cotton dolls that emphasize individuality, &quot;small workshop&quot; is an integral part of it. kind of ecology. However, cotton dolls can be &quot;niche&quot;, but the design of cotton dolls, the production of dolls, and the production of baby clothes should all be more professional. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In the past, many cotton dolls made in a group style were of poor quality, rough details, and incorrect goods, etc. This would discourage &quot;baby mothers&quot; enthusiasm. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;my country is the largest toy producer in the world, and its toy production capacity goes without saying. It is hoped that some large toy manufacturers can intervene in the cotton doll market and provide professional, standardized and systematic cotton doll customization services. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The toy market is already a red ocean of competition. Cotton dolls may be a new blue ocean, it depends on who can seize the opportunity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 21 Oct 2023 11:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[中国籍女子在美酒驾致人死亡：死者在国内的父母如何伸张正义？丨快评]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258921]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-21 10:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Recently, a piece of news that &quot;a Chinese woman died while driving drunk and speeding in the United States&quot; has attracted attention. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to Jimu News, this incident occurred in Bellevue, Washington, USA. The woman involved and the man killed are both Chinese citizens. After the incident, the woman involved refused to provide any information related to the deceased to the local police in the United States. She was also charged with vehicular homicide. Friends of the deceased told reporters that the woman involved concealed the incident from them, resulting in them not knowing that the deceased had been killed for many days. Not only that, the woman involved was suspected to have returned to the country before the US police issued an arrest warrant on October 9. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Based on U.S. media reports, local court indictments, and information released by the deceased’s former friends in the United States, a timeline of this case can be established. At 3:45 a.m. on September 30, the woman in question drove a Porsche 911 drunk and hit a concrete guardrail in Bellevue at a speed of 90 miles (144.84 kilometers per hour). The vehicle rolled over and was damaged. The man in the passenger seat died at the scene. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the police and firefighters arrived at the scene at 4:10 a.m., the woman involved refused to disclose any information about the deceased, and there was a &quot;strong smell of alcohol in her breath and speech.&quot; Since the woman involved also suffered minor injuries, she first went to the hospital for treatment and took an alcohol blood test three hours later. The police investigated the case in the following days. The local court issued an indictment on October 6, accusing the woman of &quot;driving to kill&quot;, and the police also issued an arrest warrant on October 9. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the deceased’s former friends, they discovered on October 13 that the woman in question had left Seattle before the U.S. police issued an arrest warrant and was suspected of having returned to China. WeChat chat records show that the woman involved first said, &quot;Go to the police station and ask, I can&#39;t contact him&quot; and &quot;Are you telling the truth?&quot;, and then said, &quot;It&#39;s really okay, he is safe now&quot;; finally After the death was confirmed, he said, &quot;His family should know the truth,&quot; &quot;I want to return to China to find his parents,&quot; and &quot;I was seriously injured and need to return to China to rest.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The facts that can be determined in the entire case are: the woman involved was drunk and speeding, causing the death of the man in the passenger seat; the woman involved concealed the death information of the deceased after the incident; the woman involved did not arrive at the scene He has lost contact with the case and is suspected to have returned to China. At the same time, he has deleted all the content on social media. Facts that are still unclear in the case include: what is the relationship between the deceased and the woman involved; whether the deceased knew about the woman&#39;s drunk driving in advance; whether the deceased himself was drunk, and how did he get into the car? This will all affect the distribution of accident liability. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the indictment in the King County Superior Court of Washington State, the woman involved needs to pay a bail of up to 2 million US dollars, and her passport should be confiscated. If the woman in question has indeed returned to the country, then she should have taken advantage of the gap in the police investigation to return to the country with her passport before the arrest warrant was issued. Without paying bail, there was a time lag with the police and an information gap with the deceased&#39;s friends. , completed the &quot;run away with a bucket&quot; in a short period of time, which is also consistent with the information spread online that the woman involved &quot;continues to report that she is safe on social media.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the incident, the WeChat conversations between the woman involved and the deceased’s friend were also contradictory. She said, &quot;I want to go back to China to find his parents,&quot; and in a follow-up conversation, &quot;If you have the ability, you can go back to China and tell his parents this in person, or you can give his parents my contact information. This is the best way.&quot; &quot;In this case. Judging from this, the woman involved should not have taken the initiative to contact the parents and friends of the deceased in the days after the incident. Then, the statements of &quot;he was seriously injured&quot;, &quot;needs to return to China to rest&quot;, and &quot;find the parents of the deceased&quot; are probably untenable. It is inevitable that people will suspect that they are to cooperate with the real purpose of &quot;buying time to avoid arrest and return to China as soon as possible to protect themselves&quot; . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What the woman did violated moral standards and violated the laws of both China and the United States. Drunk driving requires criminal liability. The criminal code of Washington State shows that &quot;driving to kill&quot; is a Class A felony, with the maximum penalty being life imprisonment and a fine of $80,000; Article 133 of the &quot;Criminal Law of the People&#39;s Republic of China&quot; stipulates that &quot;violation of traffic and transportation management regulations, resulting in a major If an accident causes serious injury or death to a person or causes heavy losses to public or private property, he shall be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of not more than three years or criminal detention.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, this is not the first case of &quot;committing crimes in the United States and then escaping back to the country.&quot; In the 2015 &quot;Case of Murder of a Chinese Girl Studying in the United States&quot;, the suspect fled back to the country right after the incident, but the Chinese and American police brought the suspect to justice in accordance with the &quot;China-U.S. Criminal Judicial Assistance Agreement.&quot; The circumstances of this case are different. Judging from the current situation, even if the parents of the deceased initiate a criminal private prosecution in China, they will still face a series of difficulties in evidence collection procedures, case determination, and accident liability division. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In general, the woman involved refused to provide any information about the deceased to the police after the incident and did not make efforts to deal with the aftermath, which was unkind; she concealed information about the deceased’s death from the circle of relatives and friends of the deceased, and even created “ &quot;It&#39;s very safe&quot; and pretending not to know is unjust; it is illegal to create a time difference and information gap through technology and use it to fly back to the country to evade charges. No matter from the perspective of emotion, reason, or law, the woman involved could get away with it so easily, which undermines fairness and justice. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Therefore, the parents of the deceased have the right to continue criminal private prosecution, strive to continue to seek public relief under the framework of the &quot;China-US Criminal Judicial Assistance Agreement&quot;, and give justice to the deceased. It is also necessary for the public sector to take action to pursue the legal responsibility of the woman involved based on the personal principle, so as to prevent the perpetrators from going unpunished and maintain social fairness and justice. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 21 Oct 2023 10:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[尽管发生尴尬的偷窃事件，南阳真的很想让音乐节留下]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/259039]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-21 09:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/20/zt64JEq393bR8kyisbmEvvuKcVh5qdtjrZnlCZaN.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/20/zt64JEq393bR8kyisbmEvvuKcV h5qdtjrZnlCZaN. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254768&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On September 29, 2023, the venue was muddy due to rain, and staff were on the ground Planks were laid &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(provided by interviewee/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Trouble&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Positioning To the &quot;Green Field Monologue&quot;, the taxi passed through Huangshan Village and stopped steadily at the entrance of a muddy open space.

People in Huangshan Village feel that the autumn in Nanyang in 2023 is abnormal. &quot;It has never rained for such a long time before.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The hired local workers planted grass in the &quot;Green Field Monologue&quot; more than a month in advance. The weather was not good, and &quot;people were working in the rain. On one day at most, there were more than 80 people on the site.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The road was built earlier, and construction started as soon as the contract was signed. Half a month before the opening of the music festival, workers began to build the stage, and trucks transporting equipment came and went. Because of the rain, the repaired road was no longer working. &quot;The soil compactor has been rolling, and wooden boards have been added.&quot;&lt;/p >; &lt;p>;&quot;Green Field Monologue&quot; is located in the north of Nanyang City, close to the Dushan Expressway Toll Station, covering an area of ​​three to four hundred acres. The name &quot;Green Field Monologue&quot; was given by Zhang Fanqi, the founder of Midi. When taken apart, it represents Green Grassland, Dushan and White River respectively. In the past, &quot;this land was expropriated by the government, and some rent was paid every year. It has always been in a state of neglect.&quot; Aunt Yu said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In August, Nanyang Wolong District signed an industry-wide strategic cooperation agreement with Midi Music School. Public reports indicate that the two parties will carry out all-round and in-depth cooperation starting from the holding of the 2023 Central Plains Midi Music Festival. Zhang Fan said in an interview, &quot;The fate between Midi and Nanyang began four years ago. During this period, the two parties had many exchanges to discuss cooperation. After three visits, this Midi Music Festival named &#39;Zhongyuan&#39; , with the sincere efforts of both parties, settled at the foot of Dushan Mountain and on the bank of Baihe River.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10 /20/9RQnIPsAdw5UH23l9Od949RqPptQEH6G69AsZgSo.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/20/9RQnIPsAdw5UH23l9Od949RqPptQEH6 G69AsZgSo.jpg &quot; data-key=&quot;254771&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In the camping area, for privacy reasons, surveillance is only installed at the entrance and exit&lt;span style=&quot; color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Wang Jiawei/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Before the opening of the Central Plains Midi Music Festival, Nanyang held a special preparatory meeting. At the meeting, Nanyang Municipal Party Committee Secretary Zhu Shixi pointed out that efforts should be made to make the Zhongyuan Midi Music Festival a city card that shows the image of Nanyang, a cultural feast that promotes the upgrading of cultural tourism, and achieve the goal of &quot;running a good music festival and activating a city.&quot; , the goal of making a city famous. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to achieve this goal, the preparatory work will particularly emphasize: &quot;Learn from the experience and practices of Zibo Barbecue Out of the Circle, mobilize all walks of life and the general public to fully develop the sense of &#39;ownership&#39;, actively participate, proactively serve, and sincerely Hospitality, fully publicize and display the good image of Nanyang people&#39;s enthusiasm, kindness, civilization and hospitality.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to welcome music fans from all over the city, promotional slogans related to the Midi Music Festival are posted throughout the city, such as &quot;Do A good music festival, a good host.” Some of them had not been demolished until ten days after the festival ended. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu Chang is a volunteer at the Media Center of the Central Plains Midi Music Festival. He started participating in the Midi Music Festival ten years ago. In her experience, Midi started &quot;going north&quot; in 2019. She took this opportunity to visit cities such as Binzhou and Chongli that she would not usually visit when traveling. She has traveled to many places, but she has never seen a city as hardworking as Nanyang. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu Chang arrived in Nanyang on September 28th earlier than the average music fan. Later, I heard from a friend that &quot;the mayor and the secretary of the municipal party committee personally went to the train station to greet the music fans on the 29th and gave out a large gift package.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The first day of the music festival was the Mid-Autumn Festival. After the performance, as a volunteer, she also received mooncakes from the local area. In places where traffic is restricted, the local government provides free shuttle buses for music fans to ride until the early morning. After work every night, she would take a shuttle bus and then take a taxi back to the hotel. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“They actually welcome (music fans). We wear muddy rain boots every day to take a taxi, and the driver doesn’t mind. There is also a special rain boots rinse for music fans at the entrance of the hotel where Midi staff stays. water gun.&quot; During his few days in Nanyang, the locals left a rustic impression on Liu Chang. Anti-riot iron horses separated the music festival site from nearby residential areas. Some villagers watched the performance with great interest on the second floor of their homes. On the iron horse, she saw a hole dug into some cloth with the word &quot;Midi&quot; printed on it. &quot;They were very curious.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/ cms/medias/image/23/10/20/Xp9noKj9t19PWD8l4SRvf39Salic0kliIkDE8hyX.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1707&quot; height=&quot;1280&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/ 23/10/20/Xp9noKj9t19PWD8l4SRvf39Salic0kliIkDE8hyX.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254772&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;On the day Liu Chang left Nanyang, he saw it at the high-speed rail station Local volunteers held a banner to say goodbye &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>; (provided by interviewee/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although Fangfang, the lead singer of the Laughing Band, has never been on the shuttle car, but she was still shocked by the battle at the end of the performance. &quot;It seemed like all the buses in Nanyang were sent.&quot; After the performance on the Mid-Autumn Festival, she returned to the hotel and found that her underwear and pantyhose had been washed by the staff. , and attached a note: &quot;Please forgive me if I am offended.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Fangfang, whose ancestral home is Nanyang, performed in her hometown for the first time. &quot;The whole city is working very hard and wants to leave a good impression on everyone who comes here. I especially understand their mentality.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&quot;Mud Flute&quot;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Central Plains Midi The music festival first became a trending topic because of a widely circulated photo: music fans lifted Dong Yu, a boy in a wheelchair, to watch a performance in the rain. People say this is rock and roll. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Because of the rain, the four-day music festival was nicknamed the &quot;Mud Flute&quot;, but this is not the first time the Midi Music Festival has encountered rainy days. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2009, the Midi Music Festival held in Zhenjiang also had a particularly bad venue due to rain. &quot;But it was not as bad as this time. It was indeed a bit difficult this time.&quot; Music practitioner Chen Xiaobei recalled. &quot;Everyone had a great time in Zhenjiang last time. More than ten years later, we had another mud play experience, and it was in a worse environment. Everyone had a great time.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As the first original creation in China Music Festival, Midi has gone through 23 years, and Midi Music School was established even earlier. “The establishment of Midi Music School in 1993 provided professional knowledge and a river of convergence for young people who love rock music across the country. Opportunity; on the afternoon of April 30, 2000, the Trojan Band headed towards the first bass wave in the history of Midi Music Festival; since 2007, Midi began to share its experience in organizing music festivals and participated in many new brands of music In 2009, the Midi Music Festival left Beijing for the first time and headed south.&quot; Chen Xiaobei once wrote an article recording the exciting past thirty years of Midi. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/20/uYIxLzVcNS0702O5joA6cWy9xO12wVD9rBOgT7nS.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/20/uYIxLzVcNS0702O5joA6cWy9xO12wVD9rBOgT7nS.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254773&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Sheep pass by the festival&#39;s iconic graffitied jug.

I thought Maybe someone took it by mistake.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Missing along with the tent was Momo&#39;s suitcase. She later found it at the edge of a path in the venue. “It was opened, and there were a few hats, Midi posters, and power strips missing. Because I had always carried valuables with me, there were no A lot of property was lost.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When doing the finishing work that day, momo called an aunt riding a tricycle to help, &quot;She has been carrying some suitcases, maybe she wants to keep them for herself, but those boxes It belongs to our group, so I told her that it belongs to me, don’t move it around.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Exactly like the official report, Li Wei’s power bank was lost in the camping area. It rained all day on October 1 and the temperature dropped. Li Wei and his friends spent the night in the car. When he returned to the camp the next day, he found that not only his belongings were missing, but even his tent was gone. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/20/zOY6niv2rnBveWiFEB5EuEeZYvXA0l9JyJ70XXvL.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/20/zOY6niv2rnBveWiFEB5EuEeZYvXA0l9JyJ70XXvL.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254774&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;During the music festival, staff rested on explosion-proof iron horses&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Photo provided by interviewee)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p >; &lt;p>;On October 12, we contacted Qiang Chen, the person in charge of the Midi Music Festival. He said on the phone that he had heard that someone’s things had been stolen since the evening of October 2. “Mainly in the camping area. Lord.&quot; They and Nanyang police launched an emergency plan on the morning of the 3rd to conduct a special investigation, and started to compensate on the 5th. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wolong Media released a message on the evening of the 5th, saying, &quot;According to the current registration situation of music fans, 79 ID cards, 3 computers, and 17 mobile phones have been returned, and the remaining items are being verified and contacted.&quot; &quot;At present, Le The compensation rate for lost property reaches 90%,&quot; Qiangchen said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Wei called the police on the day he lost his belongings. Fifteen minutes later, he received a call from the police, asking him what he had lost and how much it was worth, and advising him not to worry. A few days later, he received another call from Midi staff, asking him about the brand and picture of the lost power bank, and introducing the specific compensation mechanism. “Then let those of us who lost things tell each other about the current compensation measures.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From beginning to end, Li Wei received a total of three calls about compensation. &quot;Their attitude was also very sincere.&quot; Later, he received a Midi inflatable sofa as compensation. In a &quot;Music Festival Lost Items&quot; WeChat group composed of three to four hundred people, Li Wei saw that some people had received Midi&#39;s bracelets, towels, mooncakes and other souvenirs. Everyone was very satisfied with this way of handling the matter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are also some voices of loss, such as Liu Qifan who lost all his luggage. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;All he had left was his clothes, his watch, and his mobile phone.&quot; Without the help of his friends, it was hard for Liu Qifan to imagine how he would return home. Since October 3, he has recalled the things he lost too many times, “a black leather bag, a commemorative hoodie from Hamifa, a commemorative T-shirt from Midi in Central Plains, a volunteer T-shirt from Hailar, a postcard handwritten by a friend, Identity cards, bank cards, medicine for rhinitis...&quot; For him, what is more important are those items whose value cannot be measured by money. &quot;Memories cannot be bought.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src =&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/20/49Vn0QDjm7k7DFVjCa5HVjYhG4GgtSxIYFnzyKQk.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;// images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/20/49Vn0QDjm7k7DFVjCa5HVjYhG4GgtSxIYFnzyKQk.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254775&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center; &quot;>;The stage being demolished&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Wang Jiawei/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu Qifan also called the police. When he received a call from Midi’s official statistics on the value of lost items, he said that he had lost something worth 5,000 yuan. “As long as I can compensate you 3,500 yuan, that’s enough.” The other party replied, “The amount needs to be submitted for approval before it will be released.” Later. 3,500 yuan was compressed to 3,000 yuan, and then to 2,000 yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past few days, Liu Qifan has called the Nanyang mayor’s hotline and received several calls from the local government and Midi, but has never received compensation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One of his friends lost his camera, cosmetic bag and other items at the scene. The camera was later recovered, but the memory card was missing. Because of this incident, my friend still stays in Nanyang. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To sum up this music festival, Qiang Chen believed, “On the one hand, after four days of intense work, the staff relaxed their security work at the end. On the other hand, this incident also gave us Warning, we should increase the publicity on legal awareness to music fans and residents near the music festival.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 3, Midi issued an announcement about the theft incident. Later, &quot;due to a large number of comments in the comment area, &quot;The remarks about Henan and Nanyang&quot; were deleted again. &quot;We don&#39;t want this matter to escalate into a regional confrontation. This is not what we want to do.&quot; Qiangchen said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu Qifan does not want the region to be dark. To be fair, this city has its tender side, but the day his things were stolen, he felt, &quot;I will never come to Henan again.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;The Ashed Music Festival&lt;/strong>;&lt; /h4>; &lt;p>;After lunch, Huangshan Village was quiet. A woman grows garlic in the open space behind her house. She also grows green peppers and radishes in her vegetable patch, &quot;all of which are eaten by her family.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;People in Huangshan Village like to be self-sufficient. The shelves of the small shop at the entrance of the village are stocked with water, drinks, melon seeds, tobacco and alcohol. &quot;People in the village are generally used to buying oil, salt, sauce and vinegar here.&quot; The shop is not big, and it mainly makes money by selling tobacco and alcohol. &quot;I can earn three to four thousand in a month. The key is that there are too many (supermarket operators), there are five or six.&quot; The middle-aged male shop owner complained to me while checking out. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Similar to the fate of many villages in Henan, most of the young adults in Huangshan Village have gone out to work, most recently in Nanyang City, and far away in various places, &quot;where they go.&quot; When people reach middle age, it becomes difficult to find a job. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Uncle Han is 67 years old. He and his wife work in greening management in a residential area in the city. They sprinkle water, spray pesticides, and weed weeds every day, earning 2,500 yuan a month. &quot;Just take care of life.&quot; His expenses are not big, except for buying cigarettes - &quot;I have to buy one every half month.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past few years, he has been supervising work at construction sites, and earlier, he was under supervision one party. &quot;You can make money by doing this, but it&#39;s too tiring and dangerous.&quot; As he got older, his daughter stopped letting him do it. When he was talking about this, he was planting spinach in the vegetable field. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Uncle Han’s vegetable patch is not far from Aunt Yu’s house. To the right is the quiet village. To the left, the dusty &quot;Greenfield Monologue.&quot; In addition to the entrance to the village, another entrance to the site leads to Kongming Avenue. These days, cars have been coming in and out of that entrance, either driving into the venue and making a U-turn, or three or two people coming down to laugh and check in, or simply coming to see something rare. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/20/FoWsD6mfCkot7IW7eyQZqZKOby48fdfvy0S5WDA6.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/20/FoWsD6mfCkot7IW7eyQZqZKOby48fdfvy0S5WDA6.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254776&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;More than ten days after the Central Plains Midi Music Festival, you can still see the equipment that has not yet been sorted out&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Wang Jiawei/Picture) &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ten days after the Central Plains Midi Music Festival ended, many people were still patrolling the &quot;Green Field Monologue&quot; and taking photos. Occasionally, villagers passed by and walked away silently when they saw a stranger&#39;s face. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The locals do not welcome the media. A man supervising the work at the scene complained to the people watching the fun, &quot;You don&#39;t know how much garbage will be here after the music festival is over. If I don&#39;t arrange for sanitation workers to clean here now, look, someone will come over and take pictures.&quot; The scene is so dirty, no one in the area cares about it anymore. Every day, people want to come here to dig up dirt on us, but no one sees the efforts we put in.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This is the voice of many locals. &lt; /p>; &lt;p>;A villager tried to explain to me the reason for the theft - &quot;This is the first time we have held a music festival, and everyone is not very clear about what it does; if the security work is extended for another half day That’s great, there are too many people and I can’t take care of them. And some music fans did say that they left and didn’t want their things.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Chen Xiaobei feels that this cannot be solved by relying on security. &quot;Of course, the current security is not good enough, but even if a two-meter or five-meter-high wall is built, how many security guards are needed to keep an eye on everyone? Some of the harsh criticism online is too difficult and unrealistic for them.&quot;&lt; /p>; &lt;p>;“No matter what music festival it is, losing things is a high probability.” Qiangchen once encountered a theft gang at a music festival he participated in in the past. “The number of mobile phones lost at that time was very large, and the total value was It may be similar to the loss of Midi this time.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu Chang remembers that when he participated in the Suzhou Midi Music Festival in 2022, there were people who went to &quot;pick up trash&quot; at the end. One of her team members at the time dissuaded her and later became the team leader. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At this music festival, a couple Liu Chang knew came all the way to take additional wedding photos. The two met on Midi a few years ago. She had a great time for four or five days, but when she returned to Beijing, her colleagues were asking her if she had lost anything. &quot;Everyone&#39;s last impression of the music festival is that of stealing. No one will think you played really well. There is a gray feeling.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On October 19, after many communications with volunteers, Liu Qifan I received 2,000 yuan in compensation, as well as souvenirs containing mooncakes, eye protection patches, towels, and a midi bracelet. “As someone who has experienced it, it’s hard to say whether I am satisfied or not.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the opening ceremony of the Central Plains Midi Music Festival, the Director of Nanyang Culture, Radio, Television and Tourism Bureau once said, “Let the Midi Music Festival Taking root in Nanyang for ten years.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to Nanyang Radio and Television, from September 29 to October 5, Nanyang received a total of 7.0987 million tourists and achieved tourism revenue of 2.899 billion yuan, a year-on-year increase of 1.944%. %, 33.29%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the scene, I asked an uncle who was cleaning up garbage: Do you still want to hold another music festival? He replied firmly, &quot;I still hope to do it, it will be beneficial.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Qiangchen confirmed to us that Midi and Nanyang will cooperate for a long time. “Next year (2024), we will still hold Midi Music in Nanyang.” Zhang Fan said in an interview with Nanyang Daily. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(Except Liu Chang, Chen Xiaobei, Qiang Chen, and Fangfang, the others are pseudonyms.)&lt;/p>; &lt;p >;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 21 Oct 2023 09:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[叶刘淑仪： 多利用“软力量”向年轻人推广中国文化]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258804]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-21 08:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 21 Oct 2023 08:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[我国拟修订文物保护法完善文物保护制度措施]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258951]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-20 23:30:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;a>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image /23/10/20/44b67d29aa7a29fc929c1efdfe094098.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;903&quot; height=&quot;1514&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias /image/23/10/20/44b67d29aa7a29fc929c1efdfe094098.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;254696&quot;>;&lt;/a>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Cultural relics and cultural heritage are non-renewable and irreplaceable outstanding Chinese civilization resources.

The paragraph goes on and on, and Confucius&#39;s sentence &quot;You must also correct your name&quot; comes from it.

It is said that the five generations have been restless, and chaos started from Jiang. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Duke Xuan of Wei had an affair with his concubine Yi Jiang and gave birth to his son Ji. Make him a prince and marry Qi&#39;s daughter for him. Before they got married, Duke Xuan heard that Qi&#39;s daughter was stunningly beautiful. He fell in love with her in a second and was so flirtatious that he immediately cut off her husband and took over the house without any worries, so that he could marry someone else for the prince. Qi Nu gave birth to sons Shou and Shuo. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Hou Yijiang committed suicide because he fell out of favor. The daughter of Qi, also known as Xuan Jiang, who became the first wife, and her son Shuo slandered Duke Xuan and framed the prince. Duke Xuan was dissatisfied, so he ordered the prince to go to Qi as an envoy and sent people to intercept and kill the prince on the way. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Shou told the prince the truth and persuaded him to escape, but the prince refused because he could not violate his father&#39;s orders. So Shou took the crown prince&#39;s banner and went to be killed on his brother&#39;s behalf.太子随后也到，自报当杀乃我，也被杀死。于是宣公立朔为太子。宣公死后，朔即位，是为惠公。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;因惠公系谗害太子才取而代之，卫人怨恨，于是作乱，立伋弟黔牟为君，惠公出逃。后齐襄公率诸侯奉王命伐卫，黔牟逃走，惠公复立。齐襄公让宣姜改嫁伋的另一位弟弟顽，生了三子二女。而谗杀埋下的祸根并未消解，卫国的内乱依然此起彼伏。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;将内乱归罪于女人，是传统叙事的甩锅惯技，实际上处身搔操作叠加旋涡中的姜，也遭际了戕害，足以缔造另一种意义的颜值焦虑。诚然，这位受害人本身也并不那么完美。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;向称思无邪的《诗经》于此事件，颇不乏反映，譬如《新台》《二子乘舟》《墙有茨》诸篇。 《墙有茨》云：&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;墙有茨，不可埽也。中冓之言，不可道也。所可道也，言之丑也。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;墙有茨，不可襄也。中冓之言，不可详也。所可详也，言之长也。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;墙有茨，不可束也。中冓之言，不可读也。所可读也，言之辱也。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;经学家朱熹曰：茨，蒺藜也。蔓生，细叶，子有三角，刺人。药学家陶弘景描述其多生道上及墙上，叶布地，子有刺，状如菱而小。长安最饶，人行多着木履。今军家乃铸铁作之，以布敌路，名铁蒺藜。 《易》云“据于蒺藜”，言其凶伤。 《诗》云“墙有茨，不可埽也”，以刺梗秽。方用甚稀。李时珍则从声训角度解释，蒺，疾也；藜，利也；茨，刺也。其刺伤人，甚疾而利也。本草还有屈人、止行等名号，也都是因其伤人而来。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;长安最饶云云，透露出无奈于本草的遍布多生，只好穿木鞋防护。而铸铁作之的铁蒺藜，见证军器仿生的早着。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;蒺藜的品种，李时珍辨析：蒺藜叶如初生皂荚叶，整齐可爱。刺蒺藜状如赤根菜子及细菱，三角四刺，实有仁。其白蒺藜结荚长寸许，内子大如脂麻，状如羊肾而带绿色，今人谓之沙苑蒺藜。以此分别。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;主治栏下，本草破癥结积聚，喉痹乳难。久服长肌肉，明目轻身。治诸风疬疡，疗吐脓，去燥热。催生堕胎，妇人发乳带下。治风秘及蛔虫心腹痛。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;虽云方用甚稀，仅《本草纲目》里附方便颇不少：&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;服食法：蒺藜子一石，七八月熟时收取，日干，舂去刺，杵为末。每服二钱，新汲水调下，一日三服，勿令中绝，断谷长生。服之一年以后，冬不寒，夏不热。二年，老者复少，发白复黑，齿落更生。服之三年，身轻长生。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;催生下衣：难产，胎在腹中，并包衣不下及胎死者。蒺藜子、贝母各四两，为末，米汤服三钱。少顷不下，再服。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;蛔虫心痛：吐清水。七月七日采蒺藜子阴干，烧作灰，先食服方寸匕，日三服。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;三十年失明：补肝散：用蒺藜子七月七日收，阴干捣散。食后水服方寸匕，日二。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;牙齿动摇：疼痛及打动者。土蒺藜去角生研五钱，淡浆水半碗，蘸水入盐温漱，甚效。或以根烧灰，贴牙即牢固也。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;鼻塞出水：多年不闻香臭。蒺藜二握，当道车碾过，以水一大盏，煮取半盏。仰卧，先满口含饭，以汁一合灌鼻中。不通再灌，嚏出一两个瘜肉，似赤蛹虫，即愈。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;面上瘢痕：蒺藜子、山巵子各一合，为末，醋和，夜涂旦洗。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;白癜风疾：白蒺藜子六两，生捣为末，每汤服二钱，日二服。一月绝根，服至半月，白处见红点，神效。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;就中既有冬不寒夏不热老者复少齿落更生断谷长生的神仙秘旨，以及三十年失明的绝望痼疾，又不乏催生下衣的救急，更有牙齿动摇鼻塞出水白癜风疾这样日常切身的疑难杂症，而即愈甚效乃至神效的预后愿景，以及处方所叙时有情景即视的描摹，在在氤氲出与墙上之茨不可扫除收束云尔可呈映照的熨帖。 &lt;/p>;

&lt;h4>;干净卫生价格不贵&lt;/h4>; &lt;h4>;长者饭堂受部分年轻人追捧&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;酸菜卤肉、白菜花炒肉、青菜、玉米胡萝卜汤……记者在天河区天河南街颐康中心的长者饭堂内展示的每周菜单上看到，饭堂周一至周日均有午餐和晚餐供应，每餐为三菜一汤一饭的固定套餐，荤素齐全，搭配丰富，另外还为有特殊需求的老人提供“特色餐”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;根据天河区助餐津贴标准，不同年龄段和户籍情况的老年人可在原价13元的基础上获得3元至6元不等的补助，面向社会人士的套餐价格则是14元。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;与一般餐饮店相比，长者饭堂主要迎合老年人的口味，多用煮、炖、蒸等方式，使食材松软易化，主打少盐少油低脂。记者在现场买了一份饭发现，整体味道清淡不油腻，青菜还被切成小块，方便咀嚼和消化。饭堂的工作人员告诉记者，“我们的食材都是每天从市场运回来的，新鲜卫生，品质有保障。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/19/f6e41a4d9497fa32c08613c6f6a9335a.jpeg&quot;

&lt;p>;中午饭点时分，荔湾区金花街长者饭堂内，人们陆陆续续前来排队吃饭，其中不乏年轻人的身影。记者注意到，距离长者饭堂100米远处的餐饮店正排着长队，等候时间漫长，而在这里耗时不到五分钟便能吃上香喷喷的饭菜。 “比自己带饭要省事，也比点外卖要便宜卫生，阿姨打饭还不手抖。”长者饭堂是年轻上班族小陆（化名）中午就餐的不二之选，她表示，长者饭堂很好地解决了上班一族在快节奏生活下的饮食需求。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/19/09760323e8b0efda552ee4afa82e5388.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;3006&quot; height=&quot;2255&quot;

&lt;p>;进入饭堂后，走廊中立着一个竖排，上面显示就餐A区开放时间为11：00-12：30和17：00-18：00。墙上还粘贴了“饭堂每周餐单”，详细展示了周一至周五的菜谱。记者周二走访发现，午餐有香菇云耳蒸滑鸡、芹香腐皮炒肉、时菜和手打爽口肉滑，菜品荤素搭配合理，整体口味比较清淡。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一位正在带孩子就餐的年轻女士告诉记者，她在网络平台看到“为民饭堂”的相关宣传，也有一些家附近的老年人对这家饭堂进行推荐，她就决定带着孩子过来就餐。 “主要价格比较便宜，环境干净卫生。因为定位长者饭堂，所以食材比较健康、新鲜，带孩子过来吃也放心”。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;不过，目前并非所有长者饭堂都对全龄居民开放。记者致电林和街华新社区长者饭堂时，负责人表示年轻人不能来此就餐，只有60周岁以上的老年人持老年卡才能在此就餐。服务对象限定拥有林和街户籍的老年人，申请者需要提前一天预定相关服务，中央厨房第二天做好后会以快餐形式打包好送至他们的家门口。 &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;趋势：&lt;/h4>; &lt;h4>;有些长者饭堂正变“社区饭堂”&lt;/h4>; &lt;h4>;年轻人与老年人互不干扰&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;越来越多年轻人爱去吃长者饭堂。有网友担心，长者饭堂是为老年人设计打造的，年轻人的涌入会否挤占老年用餐空间和福利。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;那么年轻人能否在长者饭堂用餐？年轻人的出现是否影响长者饭堂的运营？天河南街颐康中心的工作人员表示，目前，一些长者饭堂正逐渐演变为“社区饭堂”，面向社会全年龄段的居民开放。其次，长者饭堂每天的供餐量充足，年轻人也无法享受长者补贴，“除了符合标准的老人可享受补贴，其余人都是原价购买。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;“老人家一般11点多就来打饭，而年轻人12点多才下班过来，老人家就已经吃完了。”工作人员表示，年轻打工族与长者的就餐时间不同，自然而然形成错峰，互不冲突。因此，年轻人前来就餐并不存在挤占资源的问题。 &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当被问到定价低廉是否会给食堂运营带来压力，工作人员则表示，开设长者饭堂的目的也不是为了盈利，同时颐康中心作为一个综合养老服务中心，通过其他服务也足以维持机构的正常运营。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;石岗社区长者饭堂的负责人同样表示，年轻人与老年人就餐时间不同，老人来得比较早，年轻人一般下班后，在12点左右才来饭堂就餐。其表示，在就餐高峰期，长者饭堂会针对年轻人和老年人进行分区就餐。为了方便老年人取餐，老年就餐A区离出餐口更近，年轻人则在稍远一点的B区。同时，符合政府资助的广州市户籍长者等群体，政府会根据服务对象的类别，补贴不等的就餐金额，如针对60周岁及以上的广州市户籍长者、送餐长者、18-59周岁广州市户籍一级或二级残疾人员补贴3元/餐，散居特困供养人员等则补贴6元/餐。年轻人与非广州市户籍的长者则没有补贴金额，需要全额自费就餐。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;该负责人介绍，在菜品的搭配上，饭堂首先考虑广州本地老年人的口味，注意菜品的营养和米饭的软烂度。同时，食堂配餐区有6-10道菜品可选，他们也会在其中放一两道适合年轻人口味的菜品，比如做一些偏辣的菜品。另外，饭堂的餐桌上还会摆放一些小盒装的辣椒、酱油等调料品，口味偏重的消费者可以自由取用。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/19/99a4f7494057b24c81f00ed5e845637c.jpeg&quot;

&lt;p>;中午就餐时分，店里的顾客有老有少，其中不乏附近的学生、工作的市民等。一位受访的大学生表示：“这里离学校近，而且不用花太长时间排队，可以更快地吃上饭，很方便。”还有来吃饭的学生也表示：“这里的菜挺好吃的，价格还可以。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/19/24eb98bc55783a93900c51772bb2eade.jpeg&quot;

&lt;p>;负责人表示，若是当天的菜品长者不满意，或者有某一个菜不想吃，在他们的能力范围内，可以和长者商量更换想要的菜品。例如长者不想吃饭，店里还会提供面条、饺子等多个菜品供长者挑选；又或是长者说不想吃鱼，那么就会给长者换成鸡肉，这样一来，长者们能够有更多的菜品选择。该负责人介绍，因为他们家比较人性化，吸引了很多长者慕名而来，连旁边老人中心的长者也过来这里吃饭。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;负责人告诉记者，他已经77岁了，经营长者饭堂多年，但一直让他感觉到遗憾的是店里餐饮系统规定了长者的就餐时间是上午11点至中午1点，“有很多从医院复诊回来的长者错过了1点就没有餐补了。”负责人还告诉记者，因为只能在店里面刷社保卡，而腿脚不便的长者无法来到店里刷卡，就可能无法使用优惠。负责人希望能够尽快解决只能实地刷卡（社保卡）的问题，让他们能够提供上门刷卡服务，为更多行动不便的长者送餐。 &lt;/p>;

&lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;亚马逊的自助出版系统允许任何人在亚马逊上自行出版和销售书籍，这给AI生成书籍的泛滥提供了漏洞。 &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（视觉中国/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;“谁在写我的传记？”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;当罗里·塞兰-琼斯在亚马逊上发现一本自己的传记时，他奇怪地发出疑问。他翻阅了部分内容，书中显示他生活在一个学术家庭中，父亲是一位和蔼可亲的学者，母亲是一名教师。这本书几乎可以与他自己写的回忆录相媲美，只不过上面的信息“完全是幻想”，他告诉《卫报》。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;事实上，罗里的父亲是BBC的一位电视导演，母亲也在BBC工作。某一天，他在一个装着信件的鞋盒中发现了父母的感情故事，并由此揭开家族的历史真相，这些故事被记录在他真正的回忆录中。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;至于那本有关他的传记，罗里从未听说过那位传记作者，不过，他很快发现，这本书是由AI生成的。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;罗里的遭遇并非孤例。据多家外媒报道，AI生成的书籍正充斥在亚马逊上，这些书籍涉及范围广泛，从传记、食谱、科普书籍到旅游指南等，无所不有。其中，有些书中的某些错误信息甚至会威胁到生命。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;纽约真菌学会（NYMS）便公开表示，亚马逊等电商平台上的许多AI生成的蘑菇觅食科普书籍存在诸多错误描述，这可能会误导大众吃到有毒蘑菇，“意味着生与死”。&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;“A&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;I&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;已经击垮亚马逊”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;6月，作家凯特琳·林奇在社交平台上发帖，指出在亚马逊青少年当代爱情电子书畅销排行榜的前100名中，只有19本是正常的书籍，其余都是AI生成的“废话”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;她还附上了一本书的截图，名字叫《等你爱我》，封面是一张黑白的海鸥照片。在此之前，在亚马逊的青少年当代爱情类别前100名畅销书排行榜中，这本书位于第90名。底下的两条一星评论也指出，它是一本由AI生成的书籍。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“AI已经击垮了亚马逊。”林奇在推文中这样写道。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;据8月《纽约时报》报道，旅游指南也成为AI书籍泛滥的主要类别之一。3月，旅行者艾米·科尔斯基为即将到来的法国之旅在亚马逊上购买旅行指南。当她输入几个搜索关键词“旅行”“指南”“法国”后，一本排名靠前的《法国旅游指南》引起了她的注意。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;根据作者页面显示，该书作者迈克·史蒂夫斯是一位“著名的旅行作家”。书籍的界面上有一百多个五星好评，该指南还承诺有行程安排和当地人的推荐。于是，艾米·科尔斯基下了单。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;令她失望的是，收到书籍后，她发现里面的描述模糊、文字重复，并且缺乏行程安排，看起来像是从维基百科上复制粘贴的。她将这本书退回了。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;《纽约时报》发现事情并不简单。他们无法找到该书所谓的“作者”之前发表的任何作品，甚至界面上“作者”的照片也显得奇怪，比如耳朵附近存在的异常元素、歪歪扭扭的衣服等，看起来是由AI生成的照片。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;根据AI检测工具Originality.ai的结果，几乎可以肯定迈克·史蒂夫斯的书AI生成。此外，《纽约时报》发现，AI生成的书籍也开始渗透到烹饪、编程、医学、园艺等许多类别中。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;而在许多媒体的报道中，AI生成的书籍不仅给读者带来误导信息，也给真人作者造成了极大的困扰。8月，作家简·弗里德曼在自己的博客上称，有一些“垃圾书”被上传到亚马逊上，作者一栏赫然写着她的名字，但她并没有写过这些书，它们极大可能是AI生成的。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;从2009年开始，她一直在写博客，很多内容都是公开的，可以用于AI的模型训练。因此，当她读到这些“假书”的第一页时，就像在阅读自己生成的ChatGPT回复一样。更让她觉得雪上加霜的是，这些“假书”被添加到她的Goodreads个人资料中，这很容易引起误导。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;她在社交平台上抱怨这件事情之后，一些作者回应称，他们也有过类似的经历。“人们一直告诉我他们买了我的新书，上面有我的名字，但我从未写过。”一位作者说。还有的作者仅仅一周就举报了29本类似情况的书籍。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“可怕的是，这种情况可能发生在任何一个有名声、有地位、有需求的人身上，有人看到了从中获利的途径。”在接受美国有线电视新闻网采访时，简·弗里德曼说道。&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;“实际上是在允许&#39;垃圾书&#39;的存在”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;在罗里发现有关他的传记是AI生成的内容后，亚马逊给他发了一封电子邮件，上面推荐说，“你可能会喜欢这本书”。这让罗里感到生气，亚马逊的算法竟认为这是一本他想要的书。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“他们实际上是在允许&#39;垃圾书&#39;的存在，还把它推荐给最讨厌它的人。”罗里告诉《卫报》。尽管亚马逊之后删除了这本书，但还是有很多作品通过了旨在剔除低质量图书的过滤系统。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;实际上，许多AI生成的书籍出现在亚马逊平台上，跟它本身的自助出版系统KDP（Kindle Direct Publishing）被滥用有很大关系。2007年，亚马逊创建KDP，允许任何人在亚马逊上自行出版和销售书籍。目前，它可以提供超过45种语言选择。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在亚马逊KDP平台，作者可以自由选择自助出版电子书或纸质书，完成自助出版书籍的上传流程后，亚马逊大约72小时内就能通过审核并进行销售。在此平台上自助出版书籍是免费的，不过，如果出版纸质书，印刷成本会从每本书销售所得的版税中扣除。一般来说，作者可获得的纸质书版税最高为60%，电子书的版税为35%或70%。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;另外，随着人工智能技术的发展，在YouTube、TikTok等平台上，许多利用AI生成书籍的教程也纷纷出现，其主题范围广泛，不少用户可以从中快速掌握AI生成书籍的方法，再加上亚马逊自助出版功能的便利与收益，滥用此功能进行AI书籍出版和销售的行为也很难避免。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在接到许多作者的投诉后，9月，亚马逊在其KDP的社区页面上引入了新的规则和指南。新规要求作者在发布作品时，回答系统关于作品是否为人工智能生成的提问。在其内容指南部分，亚马逊也增加了有关AI的内容，包括对“人工智能生成”和“人工智能辅助”的定义。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;据《卫报》报道，出于对人工智能的担忧，亚马逊推出限制自助出版者每日最多发布3本书的新规。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但即使新规已经发布，有些影响却已造成。简·弗里德曼的相关事件发酵后，那些假冒她之名的书籍从亚马逊和她的Goodreads个人资料中被删去。但这一过程并不顺利，亚马逊一开始拒绝停止出售那些书籍。简·弗里德曼认为，最终是由于她在写作和出版界的知名度和声誉才促使亚马逊撤下那些书。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“现在亚马逊上发布的人工智能内容泛滥成灾，有时还以误导或欺诈的方式归属于作者，怎么能理所当然地指望在职作者在余生中每周都花时间来监管这些内容呢？”她发出质问。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;而即使那些书不再出现在她的亚马逊或Goodreads页面上，它们的影响仍然存在。简·弗里德曼在自己的博客上写道：“不幸的是，即使你把这些疯狂的书从你的官方资料中删除了，它们仍然会和你的名字在一起……而你对此却无能为力。”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;
