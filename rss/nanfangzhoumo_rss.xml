The Israeli Defense Forces launched the largest rocket attack in the country and sent a large number of militants into southern Israel, where they broke into street battles with Israeli security forces. The Israel Defense Forces quickly launched a counterattack and launched a &quot;comprehensive siege&quot; of Gaza. The situation between Palestine and Israel suddenly escalated. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Palestinian-Israeli conflict has aroused widespread attention and concern from the international community due to its sudden outbreak and the huge casualties it caused. It is in sharp contrast to the &quot;reconciliation trend&quot; in the Middle East this year. It reveals the complexity and variability of the Middle East issue. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;The intensity of the conflict is limited&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Compared with the past, this round of conflicts has more obvious high-intensity characteristics, as well as the amplification effect of war news in the Internet era, causing This has aroused people&#39;s concerns about whether the sixth Middle East war will break out, but at present, it is highly likely that the scope of this round of conflict will be limited to Hamas and Israel. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Specifically, Arab countries such as Egypt and Jordan surrounding Palestine do not have sufficient motivation or reason to go to war with Israel. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since 2022, Egypt’s economy has continued to slump due to the spillover effects of the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Exporting natural gas to Europe through the Arab Gas Pipeline and Israel’s Leviathan Gas Field has become an important channel for earning foreign exchange income. At this time, if Egypt is at odds with Israel, its economic development will undoubtedly fall into huge difficulties; Syria, in the north of Pakistan, is in jail, and its limited resources will also be prioritized for domestic economic reconstruction; Lebanon is experiencing a severe economic and financial crisis, and there is no are willing to participate in the war; Gulf Arab countries with strong economic and military strength should only provide moral support and humanitarian assistance to Palestine as long as their core interests are not affected; Fatah, which represents the legitimate Palestinian regime, chooses I watched from the sidelines. Therefore, without the actual participation of other sovereign states, this round of conflict will eventually return to become a stage in the spiral evolution of Palestinian-Israeli relations. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Infinite Vicious Circle&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The conflict between Israel and Palestine continues. To be precise, it is a confrontation with the radical factions dominated by Hamas. It is the inevitable result of the long-term deterioration of the relationship between the two parties, and the explosive manifestation of crossing the critical point. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In recent years, surrounding issues such as Palestine&#39;s pursuit of statehood, the &quot;legalization&quot; of Jewish settlements, and the competition for holy sites, the tense situation between Palestine and Israel has never changed, and has even become more intense. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since January 2023, the conflict between Palestine and Israel in Jerusalem has continued to intensify. The Israeli military and police have repeatedly forcibly expelled Palestinian residents near the Al-Aqsa Mosque; in early July, the Israeli military carried out A large-scale military operation was launched in the Jenin region, causing a large number of casualties and displacement of Palestinians. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Radical factions such as Hamas and Jihad, which firmly advocate armed struggle, continue to promote the spread and expansion of their political and military power, causing the Palestinian-Israeli relationship to gradually deepen into an infinite vicious cycle of &quot;reacting violence with violence&quot; , and laid hidden dangers for larger-scale conflicts and crises that may occur in the future. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Against the background of extremely disparity in power between the two sides, the living space of the Palestinian people has been continuously compressed. The Gaza Strip has been under strict blockade and surveillance by the Israeli military for a long time, and the population density has reached approximately 10,000 people per square meter. kilometer. According to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) statistical report, 57% of households in the Gaza Strip have experienced a significant decrease in income in 2022, the local unemployment rate has increased by 49%, and 65% of the population is in poverty. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The continued economic downturn has brought infrastructure construction in the Gaza Strip to almost a standstill. When former United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon visited Gaza, he said that Israel&#39;s policy of blocking Gaza was &quot;unacceptable.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As the relations between Arab countries and Israel have become increasingly easing, especially the recent continuous exchanges between Saudi Arabia and Israel, and the possibility of even reaching a peace agreement, the Palestinians&#39; insecurity has been infinitely magnified. As the Palestinian issue becomes increasingly marginalized, the Palestinians have no choice but to rely on their own strength to survive. At the same time, the continued inaction of the Palestinian Authority, which legally represents Palestinian sovereignty, has actually created more public support for Hamas within Palestine, making it a &quot;firm defender&quot; of Palestinian national consciousness. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From this point of view, the current conflict between Pakistan and Israel is also the product of the collision between long-term conflicts that have not been resolved and changes in the game situation inside and outside the region. In fact, the Palestinian-Israeli conflict has been experiencing cyclical ups and downs since its existence, which makes it almost impossible to achieve a lasting and fair solution. The call for national self-determination and the restoration of legitimate rights and interests has been circulated among generations of Palestinians. As Israel&#39;s &quot;most right-wing government&quot; comes to power, the way Israel and Palestinian radical factions get along will also be full of violence and hatred. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Highly complex&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In the short term, this round of Palestinian-Israeli conflict will still have a greater impact on peace and stability in the Eastern Mediterranean, and at the same time promote The game relationship between the various forces has undergone a series of changes. It is worth noting that the various conflicts in the region and the intricate interest relationships between countries determine the impact of this incident on the Middle East and even the world, and will not be presented in a simple linear rise or fall. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First of all, the reconciliation process between the Arab-Islamic world and Israel will enter a state of suspension or even regression in the short term. On October 10, local time, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman said when answering a call from Palestinian President Abbas that Saudi Arabia will continue to support the Palestinians in realizing their legitimate rights, which means that the Saudi-Israeli reconciliation process has attracted much attention. It has been &quot;temporarily terminated&quot;; as Iran announced its support for Hamas&#39;s actions in Israel, its relations with Israel will also fall &quot;below the freezing point&quot;. Although Turkey will actively play the role of mediator between Israel and Palestinian forces , but it is almost impossible for its relationship with Israel to return to its original state. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Secondly, the reconciliation process within the Arab world will be accelerated, and Palestinian affairs may become the glue to curb the &quot;fragmentation&quot; of the Arab world. In the past few months, as the crisis of Qatar&#39;s severance of diplomatic relations has been completely resolved, and Syria has returned to the Arab League family, there is a glimmer of an end to the divisions and internal strife that have lasted for more than ten years in the Arab world after the &quot;Arab Spring&quot;. Under this situation, the Arab world&#39;s political sympathy for Palestine will further promote the ill-fated Arab countries to unite and strengthen themselves, and give them the spiritual motivation to achieve true strategic independence. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Third, the main contradictions in the Middle East may change. In the past few decades, the contradictions between Arab Islamic countries and Israel, the contradictions between Sunni and Shia forces, and the contradictions between regional countries and external interference forces have intertwined and superimposed, thus shaping the current geopolitical pattern of the Middle East— —Changes in the structural proportions of any set of contradictions will rewrite the geopolitical demands of the relevant forces. Against the dual background of the Saudi-Iranian reconciliation and the continued strategic contraction of the United States in the Middle East, this round of Palestinian-Israeli conflict will undoubtedly further highlight the contradictions between Arab Islamic countries and Israel, resulting in a series of chain reactions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Returning to the conflict itself, whether it is Hamas armed raids on Israeli targets or Israel&#39;s violent counterattacks with revenge, it has caused huge casualties and economic and property losses to both sides - a large number of Israeli hostages Being hijacked by Hamas affects the nervousness of Israeli residents. At the same time, the Gaza Strip&#39;s only power plant ceased operations due to Israeli bombing and siege, which also means that despair will spread to every street in the area. However, hatred and violence can never fundamentally solve the problem. It is difficult for both Palestine and Israel to make concessions to each other on issues involving their core interests. The Palestine-Israel issue may become even more difficult in the future. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(The author is an associate researcher at the Economic, Trade and Industry Investment Research Center of the Mediterranean Research Institute of Zhejiang International Studies University)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/ p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 15 Oct 2023 11:55:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[中国籍女子在新加坡被控罪：入乡应随法，别搞“舆论化妆师”那一套丨快评]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258632]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-15 10:47:05&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;According to Singapore&#39;s &quot;Lianhe Zaobao&quot; report, a Chinese woman was suspected of being hit by a driver and injured her foot. While receiving medical treatment at the Central Hospital, he allegedly insulted a nurse and refused to cooperate with the police in taking a statement. In addition, he was suspected of verbally abusing a security guard earlier. He was charged with six counts, including one count of public nuisance, two counts of contravening the Prevention of Harassment Act, and three counts. One count of contravening the Private Security Industry Act. If convicted, the woman involved may face a penalty of &quot;a fine of up to 7,500 yuan, or imprisonment of up to two years, or both.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The matter is not complicated and the facts are clear. In the early morning of October 10, the woman involved went to the emergency room of Singapore General Hospital (SGH) to seek medical treatment. She said that she was hit by a substitute driver and requested rapid treatment. The medical staff noticed that she was not wearing a mask, so they handed it to her and reminded her that she must wear a mask in the hospital. Not only did the woman refuse to cooperate, she cursed and insulted the nurse, complaining that she had &quot;waited for three hours.&quot; The hospital had no choice but to call the police, who sent police officers and investigators to the hospital to investigate. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Judging from the video released by the woman involved, she not only refused to cooperate in recording a confession and let the investigator &quot;guess&quot;, but also changed the topic many times, accusing the nurse of discriminating against her, and also swore at the investigator. , and tried to pull the ID of an investigator, but was firmly stopped by the latter. According to an announcement from the Singapore police, the woman in question even had a criminal record. On October 3, she was drunk, pushed and pulled the security guard who sent her home, and used insulting and abusive language. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The prosecution pointed out in court on October 13 that if the defendant intends to plead guilty, they will conduct a trial on four of the charges, and the remaining two charges will be taken into consideration by the judge when sentencing. The defendant directly said, &quot;I plead guilty and I apologize.&quot; When the judge asked the defendant whether he would hire a lawyer, the defendant asked if he could get a lighter sentence by pleading guilty early without hiring a lawyer. The judge explained that pleading guilty early would help mitigate the crime. The defendant expressed his understanding, and the judge postponed the case to October 25 and approved her bail of 15,000 Singapore dollars. In addition to the bail, a Singaporean citizen was required to vouch for her. From the news, it seemed that no one came forward to vouch for her, but she was taken back to the police station&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This case seemed to be a trivial matter, but it turned out to be more and more troublesome. Not only are the legal consequences extremely serious, but the public opinion effect can also be called &quot;full of influence&quot;. After carefully examining the timeline of this case from the incident to the aftermath, the words and deeds of the woman involved are a living lesson in the rule of law, worthy of analysis and analysis. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;First, the words and deeds of the woman involved during the incident may have been &quot;scripted&quot; in advance, but they hit a brick wall. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The woman in question refused to obey hospital regulations, did not wear a mask, and was impatient to wait for medical treatment. This is all true; shouting obscenities at the nurse was her intention to vent and engage in emotional blackmail. ; When facing investigators, she denied and insisted that &quot;the nurse discriminated against her&quot;, hoping to &quot;preemptively draw a portrait&quot; to take the initiative in public opinion; recording the video and publishing it on social media was also intended to launch a public opinion offensive to influence the judiciary and escape punishment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the investigator acted strictly in accordance with the law and stated that the trip was only to investigate &quot;whether the woman in question swore at the nurse.&quot; At the same time, the investigator warned the woman in question three times not to record the video. Facing the investigator&#39;s official business, the woman involved not only ignored him, but also had an extremely arrogant attitude. While speaking incoherently and swearing again, she also made hilarious remarks such as &quot;please bring all the police in Singapore here.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This case has aroused a lot of resonance in the domestic public opinion field. &quot;Distorting facts,&quot; &quot;preempting portraits,&quot; and &quot;recording videos and posting them online&quot; are common tricks used in similar public opinion incidents in China, and those involved have tried them repeatedly. There are endless news stories such as &quot;Shijiazhuang woman attacks subway security guard from behind&quot;, &quot;Chongqing woman slaps security guard&quot; and &quot;Woman leads dog into elevator and posts video slandering security guard&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the woman involved encountered trouble when she tried this trick in Singapore: the nurse did not give in, the investigator did not reconcile, and the police complaint afterwards was carried out in accordance with the law. Afterwards, the woman involved confessed in court, showing that the accusation she made that &quot;the nurse discriminated against her because she was not a Singaporean and could not see a doctor&quot; was definitely a slander. She recorded a video despite three warnings and failed to gain public opinion. Instead, she got herself into trouble. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Judging from the attitude of the woman involved that she &quot;no longer defends herself, but only seeks a reduced sentence,&quot; she has realized that the &quot;script&quot; is not working and can only stop losses. At the time of the incident, he attempted to seek privileges through emotional blackmail. During the incident, he recorded a video to deny the incident in order to escape punishment. Afterwards, he finally confessed and surrendered in the face of fair law enforcement. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Secondly, this case also shows once again the importance of law as &quot;clear rules&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Singapore’s Health Minister Ong Ye Kung posted a message on social media to thank the police for their fair enforcement of the law and reiterated Singapore’s zero-tolerance attitude towards such behavior. “This is exactly the behavior we want to protect medical staff from.” According to the emergency regulations of Singapore General Hospital, patients coming for treatment are divided into four types according to their priority. The woman&#39;s minor injuries were originally considered non-emergency &quot;P3&quot; level. Medical staff give priority to using medical resources for &quot;P1&quot; and &quot;P2&quot; patients. If the woman in question is dissatisfied with this, she can go to a private hospital to spend money on medical services instead of clamoring for privileges or making up stories. Denied on the grounds of “discrimination”. At the same time, the woman involved transferred her emotions about the traffic accident to the nurses and investigators who had nothing to do with it, which was even more of a giant act without asking right from wrong. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The performance of all parties in the incident once again proved the significance of the law as &quot;clear rules&quot;. According to Section 6 of Singapore&#39;s Prevention of Harassment Act (POHA), &quot;using insulting words against public officials&quot; is a criminal offense; the woman involved did not wear a mask, spoke rudely to the nurse, and took the video without permission, which itself has violated the law. It’s not just the understatement of some marketing accounts that “just cursed a few words”. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Faced with the woman involved’s verbal attacks and filming, the police investigators did not retort, exercised a high degree of restraint, did not exceed their authority and used violence, and did not make peace with the woman involved because of her exaggerated words and deeds. , but to initiate a complaint according to the normal process; if the woman involved is not satisfied with the interview between the investigator and the police, she can also complain about it afterwards, instead of doing the words and deeds in the video that clearly violate the law. Judging from the &quot;Code of Conduct&quot; of the Singapore General Hospital, if the woman in question really encounters discrimination, she can make a complaint through normal channels. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Just because you waited for three hours does that mean you can swear at the nurse?” The investigator’s words in the video made many medical staff “relieved” because the investigator emphasized an essential point. It should be consensus common sense: the woman involved should act according to the rules and the law, and should not try to use emotional blackmail, manipulate public opinion and other unforeseen tactics, bypass the clear rules to seek privileges for herself, or kidnap justice to avoid punishment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The significance of law as a clear rule is that &quot;if a person only needs to obey the law, then he is free.&quot; The disastrous failure of the woman involved in this “cultural export” also proves once again that only by adhering to the principle of the rule of law and discord can this kind of “spin doctor” behavior no longer succeed. In similar public events, Protect the interests of other parties and maintain social justice. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 15 Oct 2023 11:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[用“算法”找到的舍友是完美选项吗？丨记者手记]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258559]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-15 10:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/13/JJWJQrgM14LzNNBhaoDc1A8mfKbnkJfWIvlQ33Xb.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;847&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/13/JJWJQrgM14LzNNBhaoDc1A8mfK bnkJfWIvlQ33Xb. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254000&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>; (Nongjian/Picture) &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;For relevant reports, please see &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.infzm.com/contents/257236 &quot; title=&quot;Roommates are in the same camp? Behind a university dormitory allocation questionnaire including MBTI&quot;>;Roommates are in the same camp? Behind a university dormitory allocation questionnaire including MBTI&lt;/a>;》&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the topic &quot;MBTI dormitory allocation statistics of Beijing Institute of Technology&quot; became a hot search topic, more and more universities refused to randomly allocate dormitories. People pay attention. However, each school has different criteria for allocating dormitories. It may be work and rest habits, major, student origin, or the most popular MBTI (Myers-Briggs Type Indicator). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The question that has been lingering in my mind throughout the interview is, would using certain specific indicators to allocate dormitories be better than randomly allocating dormitories? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In fact, a long time ago, when the department needed to recruit interns, I tried to use MBTI to find the most &quot;perfect&quot; interns. My definition of &quot;perfect&quot; includes the following three indicators: enthusiasm for news, reliability in work, and perseverance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Originally, based on the definitions of the 16 personality types classified by MBTI, I summarized several ideal types. However, during the recruitment process of several consecutive interns, I was surprised to find that there was no one. &quot;Ideal type&quot; students send us resumes. Later, when I communicated with the editor of a magazine, she quickly found a suitable intern classmate after hearing me talk about these &quot;ideal types.&quot; One of my guesses is that when submitting resumes, she would be interested in newspapers and magazines with different styles. The preference is the manifestation of a certain personality type. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After that, my strategy became to observe among the existing intern students. If any of them showed the above three traits, then I would understand their personality type and then recruit intern students. At this time, you can follow the gourd and draw the scoop. Of course, since the sample size is far from enough, this exploration is definitely not statistically significant. In other words, it must not be generalizable to the population. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Recruiting interns is also a process of finding suitable peers. However, during the interview, we found that, unlike our definition of a “perfect intern”, each university’s definition of a “perfect roommate” The definitions are different. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Some schools hope that students can chat well, and some students hope that students with outstanding performance can &quot;get rich first and then get rich later&quot;, which leads to various distribution methods. Even if they all consider the distribution of MBTI personality types and how to consider the matching of different types, the key points considered by different schools are slightly different. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If your university dormitory is randomly assigned, will you further think about this question? Why has having a perfect roommate become so important that each school needs to figure out its own &quot;algorithm&quot; &quot;Up?&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One possible answer is that the context is changing. Some people who want to improve dormitory relationships spent their college life in the 1990s or 2000. At that time, roommates were the most important partners in life. And when these people became university teachers one after another, they discovered that today&#39;s college students will understand roommate relationships from another perspective. In the manuscript, an interviewee mentioned: &quot;Many children have very clear goals after entering college: to secure a postgraduate degree and go abroad... From the beginning of their freshman year, they will arrange their lives according to their goals and will not participate in dinner parties, etc. For group activities, the dormitory may just be your own resting place.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So, are these &quot;algorithms&quot; really useful? This question will not get a definite answer in four years, or even further in the future. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If I only look at the &quot;perfect interns&quot; recruited, I will still ask each classmate about their personality type later, usually at the end of the chat, and will never refuse to let a certain classmate because of this. Come for an internship. I will also tell him my personality type. Knowing this information in advance can reduce a lot of friction in future communication. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;MBTI attempts to simplify complex individuals with some specific descriptions. In reality, even the same personality type will have completely opposite responses to difficulties. It is just a slice of a certain stage of life. The lovely thing about people is that they change every moment. A certain difficulty or a pleasant experience will make people change a little bit. Therefore, &quot;perfection&quot; should also be a process. Any &quot;perfection&quot; found with a single indicator will cease to exist the moment it is found. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 15 Oct 2023 10:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[证监会：调整优化融券相关制度， 取消上市公司高管、核心员工融券出借]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258614]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-15 09:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;span>;In order to further strengthen the countercyclical adjustment of the securities lending business, the China Securities Regulatory Commission has fully demonstrated and evaluated that based on the current market According to the situation, the system for securities lending and the lending of allotment shares to strategic investors will be adjusted and optimized in a targeted manner, and on the premise of maintaining the relative stability of the system, the securities lending and the lending of allotment shares to strategic investors will be tightened in stages. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;&lt;strong>;&lt;span>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/strong>;On the securities lending side, the securities lending margin ratio will be increased from no less than 50% to 80%, and for private securities The margin ratio for investment funds participating in securities lending will be increased to 100%, giving full play to the countercyclical adjustment function of the system.

A few days later, many illustrators discovered that their works were suspected of being fed and edited by AI. As the incident unfolded, some original artists announced that they would stop updating, and some users changed their avatars to a unified &quot;Resist AI&quot; pattern in protest. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since 2023, ChatGPT has set off a carnival of large AI models in China.

Drawing was a means of venting and expressing for her. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;When she had no beautiful clothes to wear and longed to have them, she drew them; she secretly bought expired magazines and copied character sketches in fashion magazines, feeling happy in the process.

According to the art teacher, she is a child &quot;born for the Academy of Fine Arts&quot;, and she probably knows that she will definitely be admitted to the Academy of Fine Arts when she grows up. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From graduating from Tianjin Academy of Fine Arts to becoming an illustrator, everything has followed the ideal pace. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As early as two years ago, she tried using AI painting. The technology at that time was limited, &quot;very childish and not very mature&quot;, but the birth of AI painting itself exceeded her imagination: cold electronic information could complete a painting through algorithm training. Later, these technological breakthroughs became more like a necessity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lin Meng does not reject AI, and science fiction themes have always been her preference in creation, just like she believes in the existence of aliens. &quot;Every field needs technological development, just like when we were children, everyone drew on paper, and later on electronic devices.&quot; From the current era to the era of artificial intelligence, how to live in harmony is a need during the transition period Something that everyone should deal with together. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The contradiction is that it is difficult to live in harmony, &quot;because it does offend our interests, and it is also a matter of dignity. If someone steals your achievements, it is difficult for you to let them take it away generously.&quot; Lin Meng feels that the unfairness of AI is that, for a work that would take a creator a month or more to create, AI can produce almost the same effect in a few minutes. Although the details are insufficient, it can already achieve what outsiders would see at first glance. Pretty good effect. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As an AI without emotions, it can achieve this effect because there are a large number of original works &quot;fed&quot;. For the original author, this is an unfair and difficult thing to solve. . Without rules and relevant legal constraints, virtuality and reality will conflict. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2018, Lin Meng settled in Xiaohongshu and successively released original works under the pseudonym &quot;Durian Braised Pork Ribs&quot;. After the incident, she announced that she would stop updating and start again on other websites. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Like Lin Meng, the original artist Li Ke decided to stop updating and changed his avatar to a &quot;Reject AI&quot; pattern after learning about Xiaohongshu and TriK&#39;s practices. When talking about this topic, he was still angry. He felt that this approach was splicing, feeding, and training rather than creation. &quot;It just plagiarized the hard work of the predecessors and stitched together corpses, so I will not endorse AI, let alone AI.&quot; We will not regard AI as a tool, it is essentially plagiarism.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After leaving the platform, going elsewhere seems to be just a temporary place to stay. It is common for unauthorized works to be used for AI training. . It seems that it is only a matter of time that the tide rolls to all corners. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In November 2022, illustrator Luo Qi also questioned on Weibo that the two-dimensional AI painting application Niji·journey was suspected of plagiarism. Many pictures generated by the application were similar to the original works of some artists. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In March 2023, NetEase’s LOFTERAI painting function was also questioned for using user works for AI training, causing many original painters to flee to other platforms. Subsequently, LOFTER removed related products from the shelves and issued an official apology letter. Nowadays, other platforms cannot guarantee that this group of &quot;wandering&quot; painters can find a shelter. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In August, Station B was also on the hot search list for allegedly using AI painting to clean manuscripts and infringing the copyright of the NetEase game &quot;Yimengjianghu&quot;. At that time, netizens suspected that the &quot;Chinese Valentine&#39;s Day&quot; event promotion picture updated on the homepage of Bilibili was made using AI and incorporated the work of another original artist. It even had bugs in the details: recessed hands and only half-full shoes. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Not long ago, the popular OpenAI and Microsoft received a 157-page class action lawsuit, accused of using the personal information of hundreds of millions of Internet users without permission. The plaintiff&#39;s lawyer cited a public statement by the head of OpenAI&#39;s security department, which stated that their AI product is &quot;a fairly immature technology&quot; and that without adequate security precautions, aggressive deployment of AI models would be very reckless. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Just like the painters stop editing, escape, or mark &quot;AI prohibited&quot; on their works, or learn ways to prevent being trained by AI, it is only temporary. They know very well that this will be a long process. challenge. The wave of AI is rolling forward, and all living beings are being swept up. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/lzioPAjx37uyIQOyBtFaU0Qe6BpzjiXEu7UQl4OC.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;713&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/lzioPAjx37uyIQOyBtFaU0Qe6BpzjiXEu7UQl4OC.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253656&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Illustrator&#39;s &quot;Durian Braised Pork Ribs&quot; workbench&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Illustrator &quot;Durian Braised Pork Ribs&quot;/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt; /p>; &lt;h4>;AI Impact: Some people embrace it, some people are laid off&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Zela, a professional painter who has been in the industry for two years, is one of the earliest experimenters of AI painting - she did not recognize AI at first. But now AI has been used as a tool in painting. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Her daily workflow is: learn from AI in composition, draw a sketch, and then color match according to some pictures of AI, using AI as a material library or tutor. The painting steps have not changed significantly, but Finding materials is faster. For her, the time-consuming step is not to refine, but to come up with a variety of plans for Party A to choose from in the early stage, and adjust the plans until they are finalized. This can save a lot of time on repeated work, but because she and AI are still in the running-in stage, overall Efficiency has not improved yet. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From early disapproval of AI to acceptance and embrace, the most critical reason is that Zela discovered that it can assist in painting, and half of the works generated by AI have merits, &quot;I can learn from them.&quot; , absorb.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In her opinion, AI painting is still just a tool, but it will be a trend in painting in the future, &quot;because it is too cheap and convenient, especially the people at the bottom are most affected. Visual China , Artspace, and Pixiv have opened AI contribution channels, and AI graphics have also been used commercially, mainly in design work such as new media and event posters. The impact on animation and games remains to be seen.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The game industry Practitioner Lin Yuan told &quot;Southern People Weekly&quot; that game original painters include original scene paintings, original character paintings, original art promotion paintings, etc. Many companies will outsource their game original painting design needs to specialized companies. Outsourcing pays according to the amount of each painting, which can save labor costs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“The game project I am working on has clearly used AI to do some character design. As far as I know, there are several other similar game companies that also use part of AI painting technology. The most intuitive The impact is that a need that we might have had to outsource or use internal personnel to solve can be solved directly with AI.&quot; He mentioned that some small and medium-sized factories and even large factories in the gaming field have used AI, but the degree of application is different. The degree of modification varies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lin Yuan gave an example. For example, to draw 100 original paintings, it would take 5 original painters to work for 3 months or more. Now you may only need one original artist to produce 100 pictures using AI, and he will make the modifications. This is a model that has been widely used commercially. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lin Yuan said that the current impact of AI is mainly on the lower market, and what it can replace is that part of the market that does not have high pursuit of quality and artistic attainments, such as game advertisements on web pages, many of which are drawn by AI. . Some game types that do not have high requirements for art packaging can also use AI, but for some more demanding needs, it will take time to design and polish, and currently AI is far from being able to achieve it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lin Meng’s observation is similar to this. Major manufacturers are also using AI, but most of it is only for auxiliary reference and not a complete replacement. Because the current technology cannot be replaced, but it will indeed replace some small companies that can quickly issue orders. &quot;Such market demand has always existed, but it used to take a while for painters to piece it together. AI can be very fast, in a few minutes Or a few seconds, so it threatens some companies.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The scope of the impact of AI is becoming more and more widespread. Many game companies have begun to lay off art design positions, and many companies have reduced their original paintings. Teacher position recruitment. An original artist at a game company in a second-tier city recalled that it was very popular to find a job a few years ago, but now the company has laid off a large number of people, leaving only three original artist positions, and all the others have been laid off. Large factories also have a sense of crisis. A painter from a large factory mentioned that the company has spent almost a year training AI. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“When original painters go for interviews, the salary can easily be reduced and the salary will not be too high. Some companies that deal with original painting outsourcing needs obviously feel that the demand has become less. They didn’t worry about orders a month ago, but now they may have one There are only a few orders per month. Because some requirements can already be completed using AI, this is the dilemma of the original painter.&quot; Lin Yuan&#39;s game project art director mentioned. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;AI will start by replacing labor force, just like robots replace workers in factories. Now AI is the robots in the creation factory. Those jobs that tend to be repetitive and have not so high technical content will be replaced. . Original painters will become more and more popular, and the entire industry will become more and more elite, and there will definitely be fewer positions. Unless the overall market size becomes larger.&quot; Lin Yuan believes that the emergence of AI is to meet market demand, and what can be used by existing If replaced by AI technology, it will naturally be replaced. With the improvement of AI technology in the future, the sense of crisis in the profession of painter will become stronger. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Even painters who have not been affected by AI have discovered that after the emergence of AI, customers are becoming more and more demanding on time. To a certain extent, this is a demand created by a fast-paced era, which has also pushed back changes in the entire production chain. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/2A1UGazgFur6gR3HxRnNniCiwLt46JvYpk5KfjJj.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/2A1UGazgFur6gR3HxRnNniCiwLt46JvYpk5KfjJj.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253660&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Comparison of the illustrator&#39;s &quot;It&#39;s a snow fish&quot; painting (left picture) and the image generated by Trik AI &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>; (the illustrator&#39;s &quot;It&#39;s a snow fish&quot; Fish&quot; social account/picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;It is difficult to prove infringement&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The training database of generative AI is very large, which also makes the protection of intellectual property rights a difficult problem at this stage. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;You Yunting, a senior partner and intellectual property lawyer at Shanghai Dabang Law Firm, told Southern People Weekly that the main difficulty lies in providing evidence. The author has no way to prove that the platform used his own works for training. According to my country&#39;s copyright law, those who use other people&#39;s copyrighted works to train artificial intelligence must obtain the copyright owner&#39;s permission. However, the training process is not transparent, so it is difficult for authors to protect their rights. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He also mentioned that even if the works generated by artificial intelligence are relatively similar to those of the original author, if they are included in the characteristic files (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>; Refers to inconsistencies in the unique elements of the work - for example, Tencent&#39;s logo is two penguins, and the penguins&#39; scarves or bows are the feature files. If the feature files are inconsistent, it is just a black and white penguin - no will be considered to constitute copyright infringement. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu Honglin, a lawyer at Shanghai Mankiw Law Firm, also pointed out that according to existing laws and principles, if a platform uses the author&#39;s original works for AI training and content generation without obtaining copyright or copyright-authorized works, there will be Risk of copyright infringement. The difficulty is that my country&#39;s Copyright Law does not protect abstract &quot;ideas&quot; such as styles or concepts, but only protects &quot;expressions of ideas&quot; such as specific elements in paintings. However, it is precisely &quot;ideas&quot; that can reflect the author&#39;s originality. . In this context, if the author discovers that the AI ​​painting has a similar style to his own work, it will be more difficult to defend his rights; only when the AI ​​painting is obviously plagiarized, he can claim infringement liability against him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/Wp2LUMoUI8J3ToOdjJt3JaWKtIA7Mqt3dEpNSnP3.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;493&quot; height= &quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/Wp2LUMoUI8J3ToOdjJt3JaWKtIA7Mqt3dEpNSnP3.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253658&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Many original artists on Xiaohongshu have issued suspension notices&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;How to prove it Regarding AI infringement of original creators, Liu Honglin pointed out that current AI technology is developing rapidly, the selection of materials is highly random, and the calculation rules of algorithms are complex and diverse, making it easy to avoid traces of &quot;plagiarism&quot; in generative works from a technical perspective. Therefore, in order to prove that the AI ​​image generator infringes their copyright, it is necessary to prove which specific work was copied into the AI ​​algorithm system. However, the &quot;opacity&quot; of the algorithm makes this proof idea not easy to implement in practice. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition, the platform user agreement may also allow users to agree to the platform’s use for AI training without reading it carefully. One of the reasons why the Xiaohongshu incident triggered protests from painters is that according to Xiaohongshu’s user agreement, the platform has the right to directly use users’ works. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;You Yunting believes that if a platform uses users&#39; works to train artificial intelligence, it should obtain separate consent from the original author, rather than obtaining authorization with just a user agreement. &quot;Even if this user agreement is signed by the platform, it may be deemed as a standard clause that excludes the other party&#39;s main rights because no consideration is provided, which is also commonly known as the overlord clause.&quot; Liu Honglin also pointed out that some have a significant impact on user rights and interests. According to the terms and conditions, the platform is obliged to remind users. Users have the right to claim that the contract is invalid if there is obvious inequality or clauses that exempt themselves from liability and increase the liability of the other party. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Effective modifications can avoid heavy traces of AI, avoid infringement and avoid problems of too low quality.” Lin Yuan believes that the problem of infringement is difficult to solve. If you only use your own pictures or When commercial images are used to feed AI, the scope of learning is relatively narrow. To avoid infringement, the current practice is to make secondary modifications. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, there are also more cautious companies. A scene art practitioner at an overseas game company told &quot;Southern People Weekly&quot; that this issue mainly depends on the company, and different companies have different attitudes towards tools. &quot;Our company prohibits AI drawing simply because we cannot control the source of materials for AI software. You may encounter potential copyright disputes. Rather than getting involved in such litigation, it is better to prohibit it in advance.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu Honglin pointed out that the intellectual property issues caused by artificial intelligence deep learning are more complicated than general copyright infringement. . The infringement determination principles applied in traditional copyright law cannot fully respond to the infringement issues of artificial intelligence deep learning, and relevant laws and regulations need to be gradually improved. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liu Honglin believes that the key to the conflict between AI and painters is that “there is currently a lack of a suitable profit distribution mechanism between the two parties. The AI ​​database uses the author’s works for data training, but there is no corresponding incentive mechanism. This is also something that the AI ​​industry needs to focus on in the future.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lin Meng, who started learning painting at the age of 5, has a corner in his home dedicated to painting, where he stores several thick albums of paintings from childhood to adulthood. Sometimes, looking through past paintings, a certain scene from my growth will reappear like a movie. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She remembered that one of the paintings was a still life gouache painting in high school, which was criticized by the teacher as having &quot;big problems&quot;. &quot;At the time, I felt like the sky was falling.&quot; But it was also the teacher&#39;s guidance. , also made her decide to focus on color and use color to express emotions. That painting was a key step in her growth. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The connection between painting and emotion is a part that AI cannot replace. Her current paintings are mainly in the cyberpunk style, but they are not mechanical in cold colors such as purple and blue. She chooses cheerful colors, mainly pink, a high-saturation cyberpunk. Lin Meng said, &quot;I hope that technology and machines will not be so cold, innocent and warm, and can be associated with cyberpunk. It is also an expectation for technology. I believe it can reach a balance point with human beings.&quot; &lt; /p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(To protect the privacy of the interviewees, Li Ke, Lin Meng, and Lin Yuan are pseudonyms in the article.)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt; /p>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 15 Oct 2023 08:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[巴以新一轮冲突已造成双方超过3500人死亡]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258616]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-14 23:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Statistics released by the Palestinian health department show that as of 11:55 local time on the 14th, a new outbreak in Palestine and Israel Since the first round of conflict, 2,215 people have been killed and 8,714 injured in the Gaza Strip; 54 people have been killed and more than 1,100 injured in the West Bank. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/14/r3ul30Yf0qpASfHeUb5c5ZXZyQhhsrSXuY3QL1Jt.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height= &quot;533&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/14/r3ul30Yf0qpASfHeUb5c5ZXZyQhhsrSXuY3QL1Jt.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;254060&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>; In addition, according to a report by the Jerusalem Post on the evening of the 13th, data from the Israeli Ministry of Health showed that since the current round of Palestinian-Israeli conflict, the number of Israeli deaths has exceeded 1,300, and the number of injured has reached at least 3,484. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This round of conflict between Palestine and Israel has killed more than 3,500 people on both sides. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 14 Oct 2023 23:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[诺贝尔文学奖得主格丽克逝世：她的诗有超越创伤与丧失的力量]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258626]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-14 22:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/20/ 10/30/8e55339d6974425b5125d21cabec25cb.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;984&quot; height=&quot;738&quot; data-src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/ image/20/10/30/8e55339d6974425b5125d21cabec25cb.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;117172&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: # aaa;&quot;>;Picture/Katherine Wolkoff&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;The word &#39;poet&#39; must be used with caution; it names a desire, not a profession.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p >;Years ago, Louise Glick wrote in an autobiographical essay: The desire to make art produces an ongoing experience of longing, a restlessness that sometimes ends in a romantic or sexual way. There always seemed to be something ahead, the next poem or the next story, visible but out of reach. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;To fully understand it is to let it haunt and torment; a certain sound, a stone, becomes a torment - the poem that symbolizes this sound seems to be somewhere, completed, It is like a lighthouse, but the difference is that when you swim towards it, it retreats.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In his nearly 60 years of poetry career, he has accumulated 13 poetry collections, which are stacked in the corner of the room. Occasionally, Glick would deliberately suppress some &quot;sneaky&quot; complacency and lament that he &quot;didn&#39;t waste time.&quot; Now, a new stamen has been added to her crown - the Nobel Prize for Literature. The award citation praised her &quot;unpretentious poetic voice that universalizes individual existence.&quot; Her first reaction after winning the award was: Oops, I won’t have any friends! &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Perhaps in response to the suffering and shadow of the current global epidemic, jury chairman Anders Olsen quoted &quot;Snowdrops&quot; in his speech, which was the novel that won Glick the Pulitzer Prize. Award-winning poetry collection &quot;Wild Iris&quot; (1992). It depicts the miraculous return of life after winter and seems to symbolize the poet&#39;s &quot;radical transformation and rebirth,&quot; who, despite being constantly troubled by life&#39;s mistakes and changing circumstances, is still able to &quot;make leaps from a profound sense of loss.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She saw a vision of death at the age of seven, and was choked by anorexia as a teenager. The precocious girl shouldered the destiny of the poet to &quot;witness&quot;. With the help of myths and religious fables, she traveled between the holy and the underworld, transcending the &quot;confessional poets&quot;. As predicted in the poem, she is indeed more like Lazarus than Joan of Arc - the person in the Bible who was saved and resurrected by Jesus, whom the poet Sylvia Plath wanted to &quot;imitate&quot; but ended up The lost road. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;In her poems, the self listens to its remaining dreams and fantasies, and no one is stronger than her in the face of its own fantasies.&quot; Olson said. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Hungry is not for experience, but for understanding​&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;&quot;I was born cautious, in Taurus under the sign./I grew up and thrived on an island,/in the second half of the twentieth century;/the shadow of the Holocaust/barely touched me.&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;1943 Glück was born in Long Island, New York, to a Hungarian-Jewish family.

She also had a sister who would become a banker in Manhattan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Glick&#39;s writing is not Cold War-style politicization, but personal politics. Her writing returns to the identification of human identity. This is a key point. All the women in her works are Looking for my own voice.&quot; Fan Jinghua, the translator who first introduced Glick to China, pointed out that the rise of personal writing in the American poetry tradition, including the rise of Western feminism, is the reason why Glick has won many important awards over the years. background. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For Glick, family seems like her &quot;concentration camp&quot;. &quot;I have a strong desire to speak, but this desire is often thwarted: my sentences, if interrupted, are completely altered—transformed rather than interpreted.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In short , &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;&quot;She does not meet the definition of a child: full of hope for everything.&quot;&lt;/span>; As an adult, she wrote in her poem Wrote, &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;&quot;All the defense, spiritual stubbornness, persistence/taking off the mask of ordinary people and revealing the tragedy,/these are actually the The ignorance of the world./Means that which is partial, changeable, capricious -/everything that is excluded from the &#39;absolute&#39;.&quot; (&quot;Birthday&quot;)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the real The family trauma occurred 7 days before her birth, when her &quot;sister&quot; died unfortunately. &quot;Her death is not my experience, but her absence is; her death made me born.&quot; Glick later realized that she made such a dazzling declaration in her first collection of poems: &quot;Birth, not birth.&quot; Death is the unbearable loss.&quot; (&quot;Cottonmouth Snake Country&quot;)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The tension between mother and daughter turns into a zero-sum game between the two sisters competing for maternal love in fantasy. In &quot;Ararat&quot;, the &quot;Book of Death&quot;, Glick wrote, &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;&quot;When my sister dies,/my mother&#39;s heart changes Very cold, very hard, like a tiny iron pendant./ Later I felt that my sister’s body/ was a magnet.

When two mothers fight for one child, the mother is torn between the two daughters, and she is &quot;willing to destroy herself&quot; to prove who is the righteous child and cannot bear to split her mother apart. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This mental symptom is related to the early realization of the &quot;destiny&quot; of writing. Not only out of the overwhelming will to get rid of her mother, but also the &quot;obsession with purity and control&quot;, when she was a teenager, Glick began to strictly implement a diet, from 85 pounds to 75 pounds, to some extent, she also imitated Zhen.

After dropping out of high school, she interrupted her formal professional education and entered a poetry seminar at Columbia University, where she studied under two American poet laureates, Leonie Adams and Stanley Kunitz. Under the influence of the latter, she changed from being arrogant and arrogant to being humble and restrained. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She said frankly, &quot;Psychoanalysis taught me to think. It taught me to use my ideological tendencies to oppose the clearly expressed parts of my thoughts. It taught me to use doubt to check my own words and discover (self-expression It gave me the intellectual task of transforming paralysis—an extreme form of self-doubt—into insight.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/20/10/30/5baeee3b828154edc453d9aa22355dc5.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;984&quot; height=&quot; 656&quot; data-src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/20/10/30/5baeee3b828154edc453d9aa22355dc5.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;117173&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot; color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;Some works by Louise Glick&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;When I feel safe , I can love&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Afterwards, Glick viewed this experience in a positive light, &quot;The feeling of hunger helped me control my greed, which was very helpful in gaining an independent self.&quot; And this seems to be It also established her own &quot;poetics of desire&quot;: in love, nothing is desired. She expresses her desire for someone or something in the world that she wants to possess by saying &quot;no&quot; instead of &quot;yes.&quot; What is undoubtedly revealed here is the finitude of human beings. Just like &quot;Ripe Peaches&quot;, from the door to the dining table, &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;&quot;Certainty, a dead thing/...accompanied by that obscene mouth/ Hungry for love -/it&#39;s like love&quot;&lt;/span>;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Perhaps, because love is as scary as death, this has been planted since childhood: &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;&quot;Fear, of loss The fear of disease; / the fear of disease wearing the bride’s white dress” (&quot;Joan of Arc&quot;)&lt;/span>;; and the mother who “knitted red scarves of various colors” also said to her grown-up son: &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;&quot;It&#39;s not surprising that you are like this, / afraid of blood, your women / are like brick walls after brick walls.&quot; (&quot;Poetry of Love&quot; )&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the representative work of his mature period, the collection of poems &quot;Averno&quot;, Glick reinterpreted the story of Persephone in Greek mythology: she accidentally ate Pluto&#39;s pomegranate, Kidnapped as a wife and returning home &quot;stained with red juice&quot;, she realizes that &quot;she has been a prisoner since she was born a daughter&quot;; Pluto wants to say, &quot;I love you and nothing can hurt you&quot;, But he thought it was a lie, and what he finally said was, &quot;You are dead, nothing can hurt you.&quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Burning Heart&quot; and Dante&#39;s &quot;Divine Comedy: Inferno&quot; The protagonist Franziska&#39;s dialogue explains the power of the &quot;male gaze&quot;: &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;&quot;Both fire and eternity/... even when I am touched Before, I already belonged to you;/You only need to look at me.&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A more controversial poem is &quot;Mountain Plum Blossom&quot;: &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: italics, italics _GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;&quot;I hate them./I hate them as much as I hate sex,/that man&#39;s mouth/it blocks my mouth, that man&#39;s body/it makes people limp&quot;&lt;/span>; , the upper and lower positions of the body during sex, are as conventional as choosing which flower to &quot;light up the yard,&quot; but are essentially rooted in forced silence. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, Glick has always refused to be labeled as a &quot;hyphenated poet&quot;, and &quot;feminism&quot; is the most prominent prefix. Glick once emphasized that she and her sister were raised &quot;to reorganize, to achieve and to aspire to glorious achievements... We were never asked to believe that such achievements were impossible, either because of our gender Or our historical period.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She is logically puzzled by the determination of some women today to write as women, since this appears to be an existing notion of ambition being constrained by gender differences. Rather than gendered distinctions, she cares about a &quot;bigger distinction&quot; between symmetry and asymmetry, harmony and homophony. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, we cannot forget that Glick calls herself an &quot;untrustworthy speaker&quot; in her poem. In her case, language is a medium that switches between frankness and disguise. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The mother suffering from postpartum depression in &quot;First Born&quot;, the emotionally numb and silent daughter mourning her father in &quot;Ararat&quot;, the anger in the face of cheating and broken marriage in &quot;The Pasture&quot; The provocative wife... These images more or less reflect the loss and isolation that Glück constantly encountered in his life: he was divorced twice, and a house was burned down by fire. From then on, she became &quot;a dreamer and a viewer&quot;, an author &quot;obsessed with loss&quot;, &quot;waiting for 20 years to endure the inescapable loss&quot;. &lt;p>; /span>;This straightforward spoken language suddenly appears at the end of the entire collection of poems &quot;Rebirth&quot;, leaving a blank space with an aftertaste, which is also humorous and spicy. &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;&quot;I once told myself/From nothing/Nothing can be taken away./But can you still love anyone?/When I When I feel safe, I can love&quot;&lt;/span>; - this is the answer given by &quot;New Life&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In Greek mythology, Dido committed suicide because of the loss of Aeneas; when they reunited in the underworld, he asked for her forgiveness, but she walked away without saying a word. In Glick&#39;s writing, she asked the goddess of fate to allow him to repay her passion, &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>; &quot;Even if the time is short. What is the difference between a short time and a lifetime: Indeed, in these moments./They are all the same, all eternity.&quot; (&quot;Queen of Carthage&quot;)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This poem was included in the book &quot;America&#39;s Favorite Poems&quot; 》Anthology. In his introductory work on Glück, scholar Daniel Morris noted with interest this anecdote: An administrative assistant in Kansas City, Missouri, described in detail how the poem spoke to her and helped her gradually come out of it. Intense intimacy with a scientist, moving on. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Individualistic and universalistic, ordinary and oracular, ephemeral and mythical, tragic and comic...&quot; Daniel Morris pointed out that Glick&#39;s &quot;subject status&quot; in contemporary literature ” has enough room for malleability, it’s hard to think of another American poet since Bishop who has attracted such a wide range of critics, readers, and contemporaries. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Glick&#39;s early &quot;Garden&quot; poems include &quot;fear of birth&quot;, &quot;fear of love&quot; and &quot;fear of burial&quot;, which are always Glück&#39;s The core theme, but the song &quot;Garden&quot; mixed in it still overflows with the true desire for love: &quot;But still/there is something you need,/your body so soft and alive, among the animals of stone./Admit it: being like them is scary,/more than hurts.&quot;&lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;No wonder the poet Zhou Yan said: After Plath, how do women love? I recommend reading Glick. &quot;For a poet like her, if you are deceived by the surface coldness, aloofness, repulsion, and even the rudeness from time to time, you will be stupid. This kind of poet does not waste energy on the surface. What she focuses on is Human emotions, spirits and symbols. So it must be compassionate and warm inside. It is not the kind of poet who is cold or numb inside. This is the fundamental difference.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This voice is in &quot;The Triumph of Achilles&quot; 》 is even more firm: &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;&quot;He is already a dead person, sacrifice/because of the part that can love, the part that can die.&quot;&lt;/span >;Translator Liu Xiangyang summarized Glück&#39;s expression as &quot;love is greater than death.&quot; Desire goes beyond the trappings of self-protective life and is connected to the recognition of virtue and glory. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Let more voices fall off the paper&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;It was from &quot;The Triumph of Achilles&quot; that Glick drew inspiration from mythological characters, those who were abandoned and abandoned. The voice of punishment and betrayal was re-contextualized in modern society and became her personal and universal &quot;mask&quot;. In the words of poetry critic Helen Vendler, &quot;give experience a permanent mythical form&quot; instead of turning your autobiographical experience itself into mythology like Plath, Lowell and other confessional poets. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Glick regarded the first collection of poems with the imprint of the &quot;Confessional School&quot; as a &quot;failure&quot;. Although the Nobel Prize committee complimented her by saying that &quot;in her own severity and unwillingness to accept simple principles of faith, she is more like Emily Dickinson than any other poet,&quot; Glick said that Dickinson was just her &quot; One of the Early Heroes,” which later became unreadable, like chalk on a blackboard or scratches of fingernails, or the voice of a crazy little lady—like a kitten. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In &quot;American Narcissism,&quot; she pointedly pointed out the seductive misleading nature of Rilkean romanticism, &quot;In our poetry, narcissism reaches its most terrifying definition: It is not an extension of the self but a substitute for it, as if the lifeless mirror somehow allowed the surviving boy to survive.&quot; The end result: &quot;He reaches the end of his insight.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt; p>;There is an automatic sentence pattern in Glick&#39;s mind, starting with &quot;Poets should not...&quot;, and the following blanks can be filled with anything. Originally, teaching also fell into this category. But she unexpectedly accepted a teaching position, taught poetry classes at Yale every fall, and served as a judge for the Yale Young Poets Prize. She was grateful for this and believed that it inspired her creative motivation. The rhythm and structure of one of the young poets gave her great inspiration. She also apologized to him specifically for this, fearing any suspicion of &quot;plagiarism&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She is as strict with her students as she is with herself. The technique for preparing new poems is to completely forget the previous one. Each book is a resistance to the previous one. &quot;I have nothing to do with polishing milestones.&quot; Interest.&quot; Glick said in the interview, &quot;What I am thinking about is how to make the poems live longer. In these ever-expanding poems, he needs to reach different destinations from different starting points.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt; p>;Typical Glick, with a language style that is &quot;alloy-like&quot;, always with coldness and restraint. However, different from the gloomy image on paper, she would imitate horse braying when reading poetry and also liked to laugh loudly. Humor itself has become a weapon for her style renewal. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Glick said she always tries to &quot;let more voices fall onto the page&quot; in order to shift gears at any time. She likes poems like this: you think you are reading one poem, but you are actually reading another, and then a third. &quot;Each sentence itself is not derived from the previous sentence.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This kind of musical The polyphony has already appeared in &quot;Meadow&quot;, and Mozart&#39;s opera has become the aria in the poem. Poet Nicholas Kristof commented on the collection of poems &quot;Averno&quot; and said that the 18 poems are rich and harmonious, &quot;with complex interrelated images, recurring characters, overlapping themes, forming a unified collection, but among them Every part counts as a whole.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;And all her collections of works are not a unified collection? When the translator Liu Xiangyang contacted Glick in 2007 to discuss the publication of the Chinese version of &quot;Selected Poems&quot;, Glick was reluctant at first and hoped to publish it in full. In the United States, &quot;Poetry 1962-2012&quot;, which was published in 2012, did not use the title of &quot;Complete Works&quot;. It did not make any modifications except for proofreading, and there was no personal introduction. &quot;Poetry is the only thing she left to the world.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the collection of poems &quot;Village Life&quot; ten years ago, the 66-year-old Glick seemed to declare some kind of impossible truce: &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;&quot;Body, thinking that we won&#39;t be together for much longer, I/begin to feel that I have a new kind of tenderness for you, which is very raw and unfamiliar, / Just like the love of my youth that I can remember.&quot; (&quot;Crossroads&quot;)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She is still writing, and she is not writing slowly. The 2014 collection of poems, &quot;A Night of Faithfulness and Virtue,&quot; continues to approach the theme of death with extraordinary grace and lightness. The latest collection of poems is also expected to be published in the United States next year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past, &quot;hunger&quot; was always present. This is Sisyphean drudgery, &quot;The artist lies because he is haunted by arrival, he feels that the pinnacle is where he will dwell forever, a place where his burdens are transposed: Every moment of my life, I stand At the top of this mountain. My hands are empty. And that stone has increased the height of the mountain.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;It&#39;s very different now - there&#39;s no rush at all.&quot; Glick in recent years In the interview, she admitted that she could sit on the terrace and write trivia while thinking, &quot;This is the most beautiful thing in life, the sweetest thing.&quot; Just change the sentence and think, oh, this is okay. That sense of joy.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;It was a beautiful summer, everything was growing in the garden, and there were no obligations.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: italics, italics _GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;(Reference: Louise Glück, &quot;Alloy of Moonlight&quot; and &quot;Until the World Reflects the Deepest Needs of the Soul&quot; (translated by Liu Xiangyang and Fan Jinghua); Louise Glück, &quot;American Originality&quot; &quot;; Daniel Morris, &quot;The Poetry of Louise Glück: A Thematic Introduction&quot;)&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 14 Oct 2023 22:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[王毅同美国国务卿布林肯通电话]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258628]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-14 21:30:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;On October 14, 2023, Wang Yi, member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Foreign Minister, communicated with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken at request Telephone. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Blinken introduced his current visit to the Middle East and the US position on the current Palestinian-Israeli conflict. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Yi said that the Palestinian-Israeli conflict continues to escalate and faces the risk of losing control. China opposes all actions that harm civilians and condemns all practices that violate international law. China believes that safeguarding its own security cannot be at the expense of harming innocent civilians. There is no way out through military means, and using violence for violence will only create a vicious cycle. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Yi pointed out that the top priority is to cease fire and cool down the situation as soon as possible to avoid exacerbating humanitarian disasters; abide by international humanitarian law and open up channels for humanitarian relief; support the United Nations in building international consensus and the Security Council in playing its due role. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Yi emphasized that the fundamental way to solve the Palestinian issue lies in implementing the &quot;two-state solution&quot;, establishing an independent Palestinian state, and realizing peaceful coexistence between Palestine and Israel. Without reconciliation between the Arab and Israeli nations, there will be no peace in the Middle East. China calls for the convening of an international peace conference as soon as possible to promote the achievement of broad consensus. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wang Yi said that when dealing with international and regional hot-spot issues, major countries should adhere to objectivity and fairness, maintain calmness and restraint, and take the lead in abiding by international law. China will continue to promote peace talks in accordance with the basic principles proposed by President Xi Jinping. The United States should effectively play a constructive role and push the issue back to the track of political settlement as soon as possible. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Blinken said that the United States supports the &quot;two-state solution&quot; to resolve the Palestinian-Israeli issue, supports the United Nations in playing a role in easing the situation and providing humanitarian relief, and is willing to strengthen communication and coordination with China. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The two sides also briefly exchanged views on Sino-US relations. Wang Yi said that China and the United States have recently carried out a series of high-level contacts, and bilateral relations have stopped declining and stabilized, which has been welcomed by the people of the two countries and the international community. It is hoped that the United States will work with China halfway, implement the consensus reached by the two heads of state in Bali, overcome interference and remove obstacles, lengthen the positive list and shorten the negative list, effectively respect China&#39;s core interests and major concerns, and push China-U.S. relations back to the track of stable development. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Blinken said that the United States is willing to work with China to implement the important consensus reached by President Biden and President Xi Jinping in Bali, manage U.S.-China relations responsibly, and promote the stability of U.S.-China relations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 14 Oct 2023 21:55:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[3D还原水下绝境，亚洲第一人陨命九顿天窗洞穴深处]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258618]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-14 21:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 14 Oct 2023 21:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[154套新房雪藏12年后打折抛售，一个多月内近九成未成交]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258601]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-14 20:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 14 Oct 2023 20:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[《坚如磐石》编剧陈宇：在经典叙事中，做人性实验]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/258592]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-10-14 19:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 10/11/KyKxXJnZBTyfvTFlRrv8TG4pP5T55r4tXATQia9k.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;960&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/KyKxXJnZBTyfvTFlRrv8TG4pP5T5 5r4tXATQia9k. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253693&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(provided by the respondent/ Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;1&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The movie &quot;Sturdy as a Rock&quot; will be released on National Day in 2023. The script was originally written by Chen Yu. Chen Yu is a screenwriter, director, and professor at Peking University School of Arts. A few years ago, after he finished writing this story, he felt that he had &quot;made a fortune&quot; and wanted to find a strong director to work with. He turned it to Zhang Yimou, who decided to shoot it the next day. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;So there was the first collaboration between Chen Yu and Zhang Yimou. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On September 27, the day before the movie was officially released, Zhang Yimou, Chen Yu and the leading actors sat in a row on the edge of the stage at the premiere at Beijing Wanda CBD Cinema. Chen Yu recalled that after Zhang Yimou read the script, he made an appointment with him for the next week to discuss the script. A week? Chen Yu was confused. Zhang Yimou said, just plan it for a week and talk every day. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;One day later, on the night when &quot;Sturdy as a Rock&quot; was released in theaters, I met Chen Yu in his studio. When talking about the process, he said, &quot;I have to understand that he is I know what he is thinking about and his current artistic creation philosophy. On the contrary, he is also curious about me.&quot; As a scholar-type creator, Chen Yu inevitably thinks that the film they are about to make will occupy the highest position in the coordinates of film history. where? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After chatting for a week, the two reached a consensus on their creative views and methods. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What the audience saw in the finished film was this story: a bus bombing occurred in Jinjiang City, and the suspect died on the spot. Subsequently, Li Zhitian, chairman of Jinwu Group, and the deputy mayor were implicated. Zheng Gang&#39;s infighting. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are many wonderful group scenes in the film, and several main characters are also dramatic: Deputy Mayor Zheng Gang, played by Zhang Guoli, married the daughter of a high-ranking official, and along the way, he did whatever it takes to get his official position; Li, played by Yu Hewei, Shida was born into a poor soldier. He started from scratch and grew into a big company. The group is involved in many industries such as real estate and entertainment. He always has to deal with complex interpersonal relationships, including winning over officials, guarding against his peers who want to conquer the world together, caring for his innocent daughter, and investigating those who want to help him. The superior son-in-law. Since that explosion, the fact that the officials represented by Zheng Gang and the businessmen represented by Li Zhitian have been colluding for many years has gradually been revealed, and their relationship has gradually broken down. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Su Jianming, a police officer played by Lei Jiayin, is involved in the investigation of the bombing case. He is highly intelligent but slow-witted. He relies on intuition and experience to investigate the case. He is led along the way, and finally realizes that there may be an unscrupulous person behind his adoptive father. A black hole, in which his secret life experience is hidden. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Mid-Autumn Festival and the National Day holiday are over, and the National Day schedule has concluded. &quot;Sturdy as a Rock&quot; leads the box office with 880 million yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After hitting it off with &quot;Sturdy as a Rock&quot;, Chen Yu served as the original author and screenwriter and collaborated with Zhang Yimou on two other films, which were released in the past two Spring Festival festivals. &quot;Sniper&quot; (2022) sees the big from the small, focusing on the cold gun battle between the squad leader and soldiers of the fifth squad and the enemy on the battlefield to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea. &quot;Man Jiang Hong&quot; (2023) is based on the suspense genre, supplemented by comedy elements. It tells the story of the civil strife in Qin Hui&#39;s house after the death of the famous anti-gold general Yue Fei. It ranked first in the 2023 Spring Festival box office with a score of 4.544 billion yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The three films co-written and directed by Chen Yu and Zhang Yimou show some commonalities, such as the creators&#39; fascination with drama and their pursuit of classic narratives. &quot;Solid as a Rock&quot; has a solid plot, and &quot;Man Jiang Hong&quot; and &quot;Sniper&quot; are in line with the &quot;Three Unities&quot; principle, telling stories that serve one theme in one day and one space. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/tK4paBl06q4ikz59llIIfdapVcVBsY4rjGH9nYHI.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/tK4paBl06q4ikz59llIIfdapVcVBsY4rjGH9nYHI.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253694&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;A group photo of the main creative staff of &quot;Sturdy as a Rock&quot;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;2&lt;/h4>; &lt;p >;People may go to the opposite side of themselves, Chen Yu said. Before he became obsessed with content, he had an extreme fascination with form. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He went to college in Xi&#39;an, &quot;an extremely simple environment.&quot; While others in the cafeteria were queuing up to serve rice and dishes with stainless steel plates, he insisted on holding two blue and white porcelain plates under his arm. He used this as an example to describe the artist-like self he had in the past. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Later, I entered the Beijing Film Academy to study as a graduate student in the directing department. My first assignment was titled &quot;What is Love?&quot; Chen Yu&#39;s film looked like this: two teacups of the same color (&lt;span style= &quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;represents a pair of lovers&lt;/span>;) was put into a tray, &quot;entering into some kind of agreement or marriage&quot; - he recalled with interest: a teacup Leave and put together with teacups of other colors; four teacups form new pairs; finally they separate again, leaving only one teacup on each tray. This is a story made entirely of still images: love is the sets of teacups on the tray. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;You can also say it is very unique. I was quite proud of it back then, but today it seems to be a clever creative attitude.&quot; Chen Yu said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After graduating with a master&#39;s degree, Chen Yu felt that he still lacked in the principles of dramatization and actor guidance, so he decided to study for a doctorate at the Central Academy of Drama. In the interview, he recalled that it was &quot;an enlightening help&quot; to him. In his doctoral thesis, he compared the nature of theater and film. The principles of drama provided a methodological fulcrum for him to write film scripts in the future. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Egg Fried Rice&quot; (2011), which can be seen on streaming media, is a work written and directed by him. From the special era to the reform and opening up, and the rise of the market, three children in Beijing&#39;s hutongs grew up. Some stayed where they were, while others went south to make their own way. In the extremely small changes in the relationship between the characters, images of big history occasionally appear alternately. This film was shortlisted for the main competition of the 18th Beijing University Student Film Festival and won the Best First Film Award. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The change in creative outlook coincides with the growth of personal mind. &quot;From a relatively extreme self, I grew up, matured, and formed a relationship with this society. My self echoed and resonated with other people.&quot; Chen Yu summed it up this way. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In terms of creation, Chen Yu turned to classic narrative. The principles he agrees with include: the narrative must be complete - have a beginning, development, climax, and ending, and each part fully completes the corresponding function; there is a relatively scientific set of Effective solutions reveal, hide, and convey information within the timeline; the narrative should conform to values ​​that most people can appreciate, etc. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He wanted to make a &quot;hard-hitting&quot; movie that was solid enough from plot, structure to character design. Do you want to chew this hard nut? he asked himself. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Solid as a Rock&quot; was created under this background. Thinking and creating is hard. It is normal to sit in front of a blank word document, watch the cursor flash, and sit and think for hours. The longest time, for three days in a row, Chen Yu didn&#39;t write a word. At that time, he went to eat and sleep. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/B503aQQiAaFpH0MWrMopgpEoeZFpxaQeIlHaYSkD.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;600&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/B503aQQiAaFpH0MWrMopgpEoeZFpxaQeIlHaYSkD.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253695&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&quot;Sniper&quot; stills&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;3&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Early 2020 , Zhang Yimou called Chen Yu and wanted to make a book. He had three requirements: talk about resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, not making grand narratives, and strengthening the charm of the narrative - this is the starting point of &quot;Sniper&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The title of &quot;Man Jiang Hong&quot; is a house in Shanxi. Zhang Yimou took Chen Yu to visit and asked him to think of a story based on it. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After cooperating on three films, it is normal for the screenwriter and director to have differences and arguments. For example, for a character, somewhere, Zhang Yimou thinks he should be stronger, but Chen Yu thinks he should hide. There are many times like this. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Usually, Chen Yu will turn the argument into an explanation, &quot;What did we think at the beginning? We have several methods. What are the advantages and disadvantages of each method? In summary, I recommend this method .Send it to him. We will not discuss this issue. I will implement it according to his final decision. Let’s move on to the next question. As a person I respect and as a director, I believe in him from any angle. The final decision was the one that best suited the movie.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhang Yimou once commented on Chen Yu: &quot;Chen Yu, you can still come up with some good stories and tell them very well. Ups and downs.&quot; In the future, they will collaborate on a fourth film. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From &quot;Rock Solid&quot; to &quot;Sniper&quot; to &quot;River Red&quot;, the scripts can withstand analysis, and there is suspense at the beginning: &quot;Sniper&quot; is set in the vast snow, and the US military wants to capture a sharpshooter. , and the Fifth Squadron was ordered to bring back the prisoners of war; the beginning of &quot;Man Jiang Hong&quot; is a messenger of death, a lost secret letter, and a panicked soldier; &quot;Sturdy as a Rock&quot; leads the audience into a case where the murderer is clearly visible car crash and fatal explosion. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The academic article &quot;Genre Film Creation Methodology Based on &quot;Narrative Dynamics&quot; - A Dialogue with the Original Writer and Screenwriter of the Film &quot;Man Jiang Hong&quot;&quot; published in the core journal &quot;Contemporary Film&quot; in 2023 In &quot;Man Jiang Hong&quot;, Chen Yu used the concept of &quot;dimensionality improvement&quot; when analyzing &quot;Man Jiang Hong&quot;: in the seemingly unlucky soldier Zhang Da, the dimensionality improvement in plot actions is reflected in &quot;survival by solving crimes - assassination and revenge - forcing poetry and dedicating oneself to justice&quot; changes; and at the same time complete the dimensionality of the characters, &quot;spy and ruthless soldier - astute assassin - hero and martyr&quot;; thereby realizing the dimensionality of the theme, from survival, to revenge, to &quot;the manifestation of the spirit of family and country&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A good script must have precise purpose, structure and fulcrum. However, Chen Yu emphasized that the narrative ultimately points to the exploration of the essence of human nature. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As the story developed, the audience discovered that the squad leader of the fifth squad in &quot;Sniper&quot; fought against the enemy under extremely limited objective conditions, completed an almost impossible task, and showed the light of humanity; &quot; In &quot;Man Jiang Hong&quot;, the soldier being wrongly accused is not the main plot. The failed assassination of several small figures is not the ending. It is a poem that makes everyone die for it. In &quot;Solid as a Rock&quot;, the death of a stakeholder company boss is not the final answer. Because in addition to money, there is money, and there is also an official position. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/KGq2LVKvpgX5gvCmiyXmz6zlc8yBpfH6u8AhDH0x.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;609&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/10/11/KGq2LVKvpgX5gvCmiyXmz6zlc8yBpfH6u8AhDH0x.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;253692&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&quot;Man Jiang Hong&quot; stills&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;The blend of animality and divinity may be The Essence of Human Nature - A Conversation with Chen Yu&lt;/strong>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The little glimmer of light in the darkness&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot; font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;During the week when you and Zhang Yimou discussed &quot;Solid as a Rock&quot;, what kind of conceptual consensus did you find? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Chen Yu: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;The first sentence he asked me was, what kind of movie do I think this is? What kind of video is it close to existing? I&#39;ll give you a rough idea of ​​what I expect this film to be in the future. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;What do you think of &quot;Solid as a Rock&quot; at the script stage? 》Close to what? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Chen Yu: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I will use some keywords: cold, cold, hard core, explosion, depth of humanity, light of humanity. This is a crime film, but it is actually about human desires. When desires are alienated, what kind of tragedy will happen? There is the alienation of the villain, but in the process of fighting against dark things, the light of humanity shown by the struggle of the positive characters under alienation is what I am particularly looking forward to presenting. I am not obsessed with the beauty of darkness, but the little glimmer of light in the darkness. So I focused the story on Su Jianming. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The darkness between the two big guys (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;Zheng Gang and Li Zhitian&lt;/span>;) The fighting and game show the wonders of human nature after it has been alienated. Su Jianming, a normal and sympathetic person, was strangled in the middle. He showed the strength of a person in the face of a powerful whirlpool. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;When you wrote this original script, you used what you just said Are those keywords consciously connected? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Chen Yu: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;At that time, my creative concepts and creative methodologies began to become relatively mature and stable. I wanted to write a solid classicist tragedy. Because everyone has desires, and desires are distorted under specific periods, circumstances, and behaviors, people will inevitably be swallowed up by the darkness formed by the people around them, including themselves. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Classical aesthetics has formed a classic narrative today, classical - you can say it is classic, in line with most people&#39;s aesthetics, and has a classical meaning. I think it is by far the most effective narrative method that is acceptable to most people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There are many stages in the history of film where we are all exploring new film languages, and I was very obsessed with these. But after actually entering the industry, I found that those experiments should be internalized and serve the narrative. I would make it my first goal to tell the story well and clearly, instead of letting being unique and clever become my focus. Hands, I began to return to the classic narrative. When writing &quot;Solid as a Rock&quot;, first of all, I started from this perspective. I wanted to challenge the hard nut of classic narrative. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Second, I am particularly fascinated by the understanding and recognition of human nature. A story ultimately points to an understanding of human nature. I think human nature is a black box, and studying oneself is the most difficult. We can only keep experimenting, looking at human behavior under different experimental conditions, and finding out what the characteristics of human nature are. Quite hard to find. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many authors write about human nature. People want to realize their desires in the name of liberating their nature. In essence, it is animal nature and bestiality. This is just one animal. The other end is divinity, and some people can sacrifice their own interests and lives for some noble value. For example, sacrificing one&#39;s life to save a friend is completely contrary to animal nature. In animal nature, I must save my own life, even snatching a bite of food from my own child&#39;s mouth and eating it. The aspect that appears between animality and divinity, or the blending of animality and divinity, may be the essence of human nature. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Especially after being influenced by classic drama works, I returned to the creation and exploration of narrative art that I considered to be more grand and mainstream. The proposition of expressing human nature became the goal and motivation of my creation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;What are the classical dramas that make you watch and think about again and again? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Chen Yu: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I have read many others, but Sophocles&#39; &quot;Oedipus the King&quot; and Shakespeare&#39;s &quot;Macbeth&quot; &quot;King Lear&quot;, Arthur Miller&#39;s &quot;Death of a Salesman&quot;, Tennessee Williams&#39;s &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot;, Cao Yu&#39;s &quot;Thunderstorm&quot;, Lao She&#39;s &quot;Tea House&quot; are some of the examples that have achieved this.

Can you talk about it in detail based on your creative experience? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Chen Yu: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;This is what I tell my juniors and students. If you want to write an excellent script, it doesn’t have to be between 500,000 and 1 million words. Based on the scrapped manuscript, it is unlikely. These theories, these things you think about clearly, should eventually form your instincts and body memories. When you write it out, it may be terrible at first, but when you think of dozens of such characters, you will gradually get better at it. No matter which path you take or what methodology you use, you have to do these tasks. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;is an unavoidable penance. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Chen Yu: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Yes, only with this kind of hard work can we complete an excellent work. Before &quot;Solid as a Rock&quot;, I wrote hundreds of thousands or millions of words. When I just graduated, China&#39;s film industry had not yet emerged, so I did everything, including commercials, promotional films, and various TV series. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I don’t believe in the emergence of genius, especially for a highly integrated, systematic, and technologically demanding form like film. Just like a musician, when a piece of music comes to mind, It’s very rare to have your inspiration written down and become an eternal song. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Similar to this - facing a blank document in front of the computer - a difficult thinking process, I actually exercised the complexity of thinking. I have always believed that human thinking has dimensions. Most people&#39;s thinking is one-dimensional: I like this boy, I am good with him; I don&#39;t like this leader, I stay away from him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The troubles in daily life may be two-dimensional: Although I don’t like this leader, I have to support my family, so although I resent him, I must regulate my work well so that he can Pay attention to me. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In literary and artistic works, it may be even deeper: I don’t like this person’s style, and I have to cater to him, but in the end I still slam the table at him. It forms three dimensions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Establishing multi-dimensional thinking and looking for the relationship between these dimensions, I attribute it to the ability to carry out complex thinking. The creation of a movie involves a lot of elements, at least thousands of thinking points must be thought of, and it must be formed into a structure, which is very complicated. Saying that an author is relatively mature may have a lot to do with what I just talked about. With training and thinking, he gradually acquires the ability to think about complex problems and the methods to organize complex thinking. Maybe the works he can produce will reach a better level in terms of depth, integration, and self-consistency. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This dimensional thinking has also entered my methodology. I often discuss my work with my team. There are three dimensions that are the basis for a script. I still have to do it. It is very difficult to improve one dimension above these three dimensions. It is not a mechanical superposition, but an increase in dimensions. It seems that what I am writing is about breaking through the ceiling of this dimension and entering a new direction in the new dimension. But they are related, not running around. The audience thinks that&#39;s it, I want to come up with something new and unexpected to give the audience this kind of psychological feeling. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;When you and your team create, you will visually combine this Is the process presented, like drawing a force analysis diagram? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Chen Yu: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Draw thinking maps from various angles. Content creation is a systematic project. Screenwriting can be divided into two stages: first, the planning and original story stage; second, the script stage. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Planning an original story means clarifying what kind of movie we want to make, what is its proposition, and what is its aesthetic style? What kind of audience interest do we correspond to? You need to understand society, the current popular psychology in China, as well as the film’s partners, investment scale, etc. These become an entry point for original stories. We all analyze and discuss together as a team. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I will also divide some of the work. For example, if we want to make a detective film, we will list related literature and movies, which is equivalent to a paper. When making a detective film on this basis, where is our contemporary nature reflected? We can no longer write like Conan Doyle and Agatha Christie. At least we have to stand on the shoulders of Keigo Higashino and look at the problem. Then we will brainstorm the story and come up with, for example, 10 story models, assign them to everyone, and first write a 500-word summary (summary). Let&#39;s go forward - circle this land, we don&#39;t know where there is water, we dig holes, if this road is a dead end, then don&#39;t go; the remaining three holes seem to have potential and may produce running water. , write down to 3,000 words, and then compare them to find the right pitfall. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the second stage, I started writing the first draft of the script and completed it in one go. Later, the revision of this first draft will come in, with various specific elements of the project coming in. Once the actor is determined, we will make adjustments based on the actor’s situation. For example, in &quot;Man Jiang Hong&quot;, I may strengthen Shen Teng&#39;s strengths in the script and give him a more advanced sense of humor in his lines. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The industry’s understanding of screenwriting in a broad sense is “Bring me a notebook.” However, the difference between these two parts (&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;the above two stages&lt;/span>;) is very big, and the former one is even as important as the latter one. It is not only about screenwriting ability, but actually involves understanding of society and the industry. Only with these first can a good project be produced. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You have said before that your team adopts a very scientific approach creative method. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Chen Yu: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Yes, a good work is seamless, like a natural organism, and it is difficult to separate the parts from the whole. The more difficult a work is to disassemble, the more organic it is. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;You know the stress structure of the script. As long as the components can be extracted and this piece can be disassembled, then improve it. For example, I know very well that the narrative information in this dialogue is not enough, so we need to increase the conflict of this dialogue and complete the presentation of narrative information in the conflict. Do detail polishing like this. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of course, creation is a combination of sensibility and rationality. What drives you to write a work must be emotion, anger, sympathy, emotion, regret, etc. The emotions inspired by the creator are particularly precious. The longer you work in the industry, the harder it is to inspire emotional impulses because you have seen them more. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To protect this emotion, even if a small article or a song makes my heart tremble, I will immediately think, what moved me? This cannot be a general good. I care for this flame very carefully, analyze and summarize it, and amplify it into a flame. This flame is the motivation that inspires me to engage in subsequent rational creations. Be very clear about what this flame is. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 凯体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;How can you be sure that the flame you cherish will also be moved? Most people, can it be developed into a classic narrative film? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Chen Yu: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;Every artist has his own unique feelings about the world, but people need someone who gradually understands others and truly integrates with society. process. I don’t think an artist should be absolutely unique, unless he spends his life doing experimental and avant-garde art, which is very valuable and explores the boundaries of human thoughts and emotions. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But other excellent works are constantly searching for the noble meaning of the human spirit, looking for consensus and presenting it. The value of the creator lies in connection. I think you are truly mature when you can gradually submerge yourself in the crowd and understand the emotions common to most people. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Why do I think what touches me can touch other people? First of all, I am a human being. Secondly, when I become a mature person, my understanding of the world is broader, I can accommodate more life styles and emotional operation methods, and my heart is fuller, then my breathing, feelings, and Others&#39; frequencies will be more likely to converge. The extremely personal part of me can gradually form a certain resonance with other people. At this time, I can gradually understand the psychological pulse of the public. There are situations like this: I was very moved when I saw this story, but it is not that important to other people; but there are also some stories that I can naturally judge that have emotional value to more people, and I can present them. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To this day, I hope that my works can communicate with more people. Many literary and artistic young people think this is degeneracy, but I don&#39;t think so. I hope my works can influence and touch more people, and give more people emotional comfort. This moment is the moment when I feel my creation is the most valuable. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Artistic creation comes from restrictions&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Kaiti, Kaiti_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;《 &quot;Sturdy as a Rock&quot; is a complete script you wrote yourself. The original ideas for the last two films you collaborated with director Zhang Yimou, &quot;Man Jiang Hong&quot; and &quot;Sniper&quot; were not proposed by you. After receiving the invitation, how did you make it happen? They become works that come from your soul and can move you. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Chen Yu: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I think art comes from limitations. Dance was born when words were not allowed and only body movements were allowed to convey information and emotions. Opera is created when speaking in a normal way is not allowed, but complex narrative information needs to be conveyed. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I also mentioned in other interviews that Yimou will have some keywords. For example, we will make a movie about resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea and telling a sniper story. I need keywords and restrictions. I can tell a real-time story, from a person&#39;s perspective to see him involved in complex things. Although there is a lot of freedom in telling stories from multiple viewpoints, you will find that this kind of story is not that interesting when told. Many times, the pleasure and value of narrative come from this precise control of perspective. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As far as the movie situation is concerned, restrictions will make you freer and more imaginative. Sometimes when I recruit students for exams, I just throw them questions like this: Now you are a helpless person, and you are forced into the toilet of a shopping mall by gangsters. The gangsters are smashing the door outside to rush in. You want to get out of trouble, but there is no second door, what should you do? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Essentially this is a partial training. The audience just wants to watch, but when they are cornered, what can the creator do? When you really come up with a valuable method, accomplish it unexpectedly and reasonably, and the audience feels satisfied, you have completed your conspiracy with the audience. Creators also have to push themselves into a corner. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;For example, what kind of solution would you give to the proposition just now? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Chen Yu: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;There are all kinds. For example, they tried to trick him in the east and hit him with a stone; they let the water tank ring and I walked to another compartment. Others wonder how to contact the outside world and call security... There is no standard answer. This actually depends on your creativity and how many ways you can convey and present information in the same scene. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;I will also ask another question, such as naming 15 uses for glass. Most people would say, I can use it to grow flowers, raise goldfish, drink wine, drink water, and drink juice. This answer gets no points because it only uses the container properties of the cup. Some people will answer, put a light bulb inside it, shake it, and create light spots on the wall. You can take five glasses and stand on them as plum blossom piles. You can break it and use the pieces to commit suicide. You can use it to focus sunlight and use it as a convex lens. The scoring started. If you can think outside the box, your creativity will obviously be stronger. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Southern People Weekly:&lt;/strong>;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: KaiTi, KaiTi_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;You said before that screenwriting is a profession that requires a lot of film industry literacy , you are in academia and industry at the same time, will you look for a common methodology and promote it? &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Chen Yu: &lt;/strong>;&lt;span>;I do not regard it as a golden rule that should be promoted to the entire industry. Everyone may have different concepts about movies, and even the same concept may have different emphasis, and different authors have different ways of expressing it. All I can do now is use my own method to work with my collaborators to complete something that I think is OK. In teaching, I introduce my methods to students, and they find their own creative methods. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, should you do the structure first or the characters first? There are two different kinds of creation: I first think about the structure of the story and then put the people in it; or I first build the person and let the people move and do things on their own to form a structure. Aristotle believed that both were possible, but he preferred structure first. I do the same thing myself, do the structure first. But there are also many excellent creators who let the person in my mind appear first. With every frown and smile, how he does things and how he reacts when meeting people, I let him face these things as a character. I think it&#39;s also very good. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 14 Oct 2023 19:25:03 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
