Looking at the country, Chengdu can be one of the leaders in exploring and embracing this urban power engine. From building a nest to attract &quot;Rongcheng drifters&quot;, to building a &quot;City of Volunteers&quot;, to new young people and new careers, we observe the uniqueness of this Chengdu from a top-down perspective.</description><pubDate> Thu, 30 Nov 2023 00:25:02 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[拼多多市值距阿里仅一步之遥，“多多的时代来临”？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261574]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-29 23:19:55&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img img-id=&quot;73842&quot; group-id=&quot;0&quot; asset-id=&quot;70633&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/ff632a6137.jpg&quot; img-title=&quot;WechatIMG5565.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Pinduoduo’s wall-painting promotion in 2020.

Image source: Pinduoduo Weibo&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the evening of November 28, 2023, Beijing time, Pinduoduo’s intraday trading repeatedly hit new highs, rising by more than 18%. Within fifteen minutes, the market value increased by $100 million. &lt;br>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From the opening to the closing, Pinduoduo’s total market value soared from US$156.4 billion to US$184.7 billion, a surge of nearly 30 billion. As of the close, Pinduoduo was only tens of billions away from Alibaba, which has a market capitalization of US$195.2 billion. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If compared according to the price limit rules of China&#39;s A-share market, Pinduoduo is only one &quot;price limit&quot; away from Alibaba. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Pinduoduo’s rapid rise has triggered heated discussions among investors. Some people lamented that the throne of e-commerce is about to change hands and that &quot;an era of great things is coming&quot;, while others joked that &quot;the higher the stock price rises, the poorer everyone becomes.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The fierce reaction of the capital market stems from Pinduoduo’s outstanding performance in the third quarter of 2023. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On November 28, Pinduoduo (PDD.Nasdaq) released its financial report for the third quarter of 2023 (hereinafter referred to as the &quot;financial report&quot;), with revenue of 68.84 billion yuan, a year-on-year increase of 94%, not in accordance with U.S. GAAP (Non-GAAP), net profit attributable to Pinduoduo’s ordinary shareholders was 17.027 billion yuan, a year-on-year increase of 37%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“We can clearly feel the continued recovery of the economy, as well as the potential and resilience of the consumer market. At the same time, we also see from user behavior that consumption upgrades are both about quality and price. The optimization of price-performance ratio is consumers&#39; ultimate pursuit of good products at good prices.&quot; said Chen Lei, Chairman and Co-CEO of Pinduoduo Group. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Reviewing Pinduoduo’s past financial reports, it achieved (Non-GAAP) quarterly profit for the first time in the third quarter of 2020, a year-on-year increase of 89%. Since then, although revenue has doubled on average every quarter, it was not until the second quarter of 2021 that Pinduoduo achieved double growth in revenue and net profit in a single quarter for the first time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Up to now, Pinduoduo has drawn a significant upward curve of revenue growth and net profit doubling for two consecutive years. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Buy a lot of groceries, a hidden revenue tool&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Chen Lei attributed the revenue growth to the improvement of the consumer environment and the implementation of the company&#39;s &quot;high-quality development&quot; strategy. Judging from the financial report, Pinduoduo’s 94% revenue growth was due to the double increase in revenue from its two main businesses. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Online marketing services and other services increased by 39% year-on-year, and transaction service revenue increased by as much as 315% year-on-year. The two account for about half of the total revenue. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What supports the growth of transaction service revenue is generally an increase in the number of active merchants on the platform and an increase in the average transaction service revenue of each active merchant (i.e. commission). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporter learned from a Pinduoduo merchant that the transaction commission is charged based on the sales price of the completed order, and the commission will not be refunded if the consumer returns the product. Pinduoduo did not release GMV (gross merchandise transaction) data in this financial report. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Huang Lichong, President of Huisheng International Capital, analyzed to Southern Weekend reporters that transaction service fees actually include the income of Duoduo Maicai. This quarter’s unexpected growth is due to the rapid expansion of Duoduo Maicai. Huang Lichong once served as executive director and managing director of the investment banking department of China International Finance Securities (Hong Kong). &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Duoduomaicai was launched in August 2020. Since then, Pinduoduo’s transaction service fee income has increased significantly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Chen Lei commented at the 2020 third quarter earnings conference call that Duoduo’s grocery shopping business is “a platform that consumers use very frequently.” Entering the fourth quarter of 2020, Pinduoduo’s number of active buyers surpassed Alibaba for the first time, reaching 788 million. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since its establishment, Duoduomaicai has gone through many rounds of fierce battles between platforms and has survived the dark moment of community group buying. According to reports from many media including Qilu Evening News, nine provinces have been shut down in order to target the prosperity of the sinking market. Jingxi Pinpin is only left in Langfang, Hebei and Beijing. Other community group buying has also been shut down one after another. Currently, Pinduoduo and Meituan Each controls half of the country. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the beginning of 2023, the US asset management company HAYDEN CAPITAL estimated that by 2025, Duoduo Maicai will contribute at least about 14 billion yuan in EBIT to Pinduoduo, which may start in 2023 Achieve overall profitability. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At this financial performance meeting, Chen Lei introduced that Pinduoduo started out in agricultural products and retained a number of users through agricultural products services. However, the current online rate of this category is low, and there is huge potential in the future. potential. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to Duoduo’s grocery shopping, the market generally speculates that Duoduo’s cross-border services may create a new revenue growth curve for Pinduoduo. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In September 2022, Pinduoduo launched the cross-border e-commerce project Temu, which Chen Lei regarded as his &quot;third venture.&quot; At that time, Pinduoduo’s vice president of finance, Liu Jun, said that cross-border business was in its early stages and would have little impact on financial reports. Temu’s revenue data was not announced in this financial report. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Duoduo’s cross-border project is led by Gu Pingping, the former head of Duoduo’s grocery shopping, and inherits Pinduoduo’s domestic supply, talent, and marketing advantages. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At this financial report meeting, Liu Jun said, &quot;Pinduoduo&#39;s global business is still in a very early stage, and the team is still increasing its understanding of consumer needs in different markets around the world.&quot; Currently, Temu has launched a In 2016, it has expanded to 40 countries and regions around the world. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Getting out of the quagmire of losses&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;On November 28, in contrast to the upward trend in Pinduoduo’s stock price, the stock price of Alibaba (BABA.NYSE) dropped all the way. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Consumption downgrading is an increasingly clear trend. Consumers are moving from platforms with high unit prices to low-price platforms. Low price is still the key for Pinduoduo to occupy the sinking market in China. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Looking back at Pinduoduo’s growth history, the “10 billion subsidy” strategy has not only opened up the market for it, but is also the main reason for dragging down its financial performance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Pinduoduo has faced significant losses since its listing. From 2018 to the first quarter of 2020, losses continued to expand. In June 2019, after the &quot;Ten Billion Subsidy&quot; was launched, it achieved GMV growth and increased user activity. The price was that its sales and marketing expenses exceeded profits, which was equivalent to all the revenue. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Entering the second quarter of 2020, Pinduoduo’s losses have narrowed. Ma Jing, Pinduoduo’s vice president of finance at the time, said at the earnings conference call, “Profitability will not be considered this year.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It was not until the third quarter of 2020 that Pinduoduo achieved profitability for the first time, which was also when CEO Chen Lei took office. The first report card after. This year, Pinduoduo launched Duoduo’s grocery shopping business. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Pinduoduo really &quot;taken off&quot; in the second quarter of 2021, with both revenue and profit increasing, and getting out of the mire of losses. Since then, it has almost maintained a double-digit profit growth. In particular, three quarters in 2022 will achieve multiple growth, with profits in the second quarter nearly tripling. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Ma Jing responded at the second quarter 2021 conference call that revenue growth stems from the increase in the number of users and the increase in user psychological share, and the second quarter is the off-season for marketing, so marketing expenditures are small and there are seasonal factors. Special reasons for sex. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, Pinduoduo executives also made no secret of the fact that the increase in profits comes from cost reduction and efficiency increase during the 2021 financial results conference call. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Huang Lichong said that over the years, Pinduoduo has optimized its operating costs, reduced some unnecessary expenses, increased profit margins by increasing product prices and reducing after-sales service costs, while investing in technology, logistics, agriculture and other fields. , improve its own competitiveness and business efficiency. These strategies have effectively helped it get out of losses and achieve profits beyond expectations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Pinduoduo’s executive director and co-CEO Zhao Jiazhen revealed in a recent earnings conference call that during the just past “Double Eleven” promotion, the number of users of Pinduoduo’s “10 billion subsidy” has exceeded 620 million. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the first trading day after the financial report was released, employees on Alibaba’s intranet discussed Pinduoduo’s performance in the capital market. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Alibaba partner Jack Ma rarely replied, &quot;All great companies are born in winter. The era of AI e-commerce has just begun, and it is both an opportunity and a challenge for everyone. I would like to congratulate Pinduoduo for the past few years. Decision-making, execution and efforts. No one is better, but those who can reform for the sake of tomorrow and the organization that are willing to pay any price and sacrifice are respected.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;br>;&lt;/ p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 29 Nov 2023 23:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[戏骨云集的《风声》姐妹篇，砸了]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261518]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-29 22:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p data-mpa-powered-by=&quot;yiban.io&quot;>;The new theatrical film &quot;The Point of the Knife&quot; is the latest version of &quot;The Wind&quot; &quot;Sister volume of &quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is also an original work by Mai Jia + director Gao Qunshu, with a spy war theme + a bone drama, but the reputation is far different. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/5e5887f258139695a465a4e2e7c48738.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;1511&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/5e5887f258139695a465a4e2e7c48738.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;259921&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Today, 14 years after its release, &quot;The Wind&quot; is still the leading Chinese-language spy suspense film. 600,000 people gave it a high score of 8.4 on Douban, which is better than 95% of dramas and 98% of thrillers.

The Japanese military officer issued an order to &quot;find out the insider&quot;, which triggered an office struggle among insiders. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To be fair, ignoring the bugs in the character&#39;s logic, this part is quite watchable, and it can be regarded as a low-end version of Qiuzhuang&#39;s ghost-catching in &quot;The Wind&quot;. Lu and Yu&#39;s small team took action one after another, some to protect themselves, others to bite each other. It didn&#39;t matter who the real mole was, what was important was to take the opportunity to eliminate dissidents. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/e48a3c0d3863c0c34d242363a2399c45.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;608&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/e48a3c0d3863c0c34d242363a2399c45.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;259927 &quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Why is it called a low-end version? Because there is a clear MacGuffin in &quot;The Wind&quot; (the focus of the suspense film) - who is the old ghost. However, &quot;The Point of the Knife&quot; revealed the truth to the audience from the very beginning. The identities of Jin Shenshui and Lin Yingying were two bright cards that were played too early, and there was no suspense left. We&#39;re just waiting to see how they can use their strength to survive the internal purge. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/b3d3ffeeaf284eab333a9359d504203e.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;366&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/b3d3ffeeaf284eab333a9359d504203e.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;259924 &quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;The highlight of &quot;The Wind&quot; is by no means torture, but this was highlighted in the pre-release marketing in the past. The trailers and character specials of &quot;The Edge of the Knife&quot; also have similar ideas. It mainly highlights the continuous punishment stunts during the internal fighting, such as pulling out nails, pouring sulfuric acid, sitting on the tiger bench, etc. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/61b498a3a850489f380e99831aef8c6f.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;608&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/61b498a3a850489f380e99831aef8c6f.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;259925 &quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;In addition, the director made reasonable use of the characteristics of the actors&#39; past high-profile roles&lt;/span>;&lt;span>; (for example, Huang Zhizhong&#39;s performance is similar to the role of Yang Liren in &quot;The Righteous Way in the World is Vicissitudes of Life&quot;)&lt;/span>;&lt;span>; span>;&lt;span>;, so that they can maintain stable performance while performing experiential performances,&lt;/span>; at least the audience can accurately grasp the characters they convey. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The cruel scenes that challenge the physical limits, the medium-to-high-intensity &quot;werewolf killing&quot; and the survival game in which everyone is in danger ensure the tension in the first half of the film. But unfortunately, since the victory of the Lu faction and the end of the internal fighting, the film has fallen into piecemeal chaos. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The first hour and the last hour of &quot;The Point of the Knife&quot; are as separate as if they were not the same movie. The second half of the film focuses on Jin Shenshui&#39;s abandonment of darkness and the light under the influence of Lin Yingying, the destruction of the military command group in Nanjing, and the two men&#39;s revenge like lone rangers. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/4d15d7961ec0dec26a49b22d4e8969e5.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot; opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;608&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/4d15d7961ec0dec26a49b22d4e8969e5.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;259928 &quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Because the plot was too complicated and fragmented, and the time&lt;/span>; span was long, the director had to arrange multiple long monologues for Jin Shenshui, with voiceovers revealing the changes in the situation and the characters. destiny. However, using dubbing to promote narrative in film and television works is undoubtedly a very weak choice. On the contrary, it proves that the film is unable to tell stories with pictures and characters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/fc6639ab4d254361f39ebce1ee21cfb8.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;405&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/fc6639ab4d254361f39ebce1ee21cfb8.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;259926&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Although there are many characters appearing in the first half, they still have distinct personalities. But the characters who appear in the second half, such as the members of the military command team stationed in Nanjing, Lin Yingying&#39;s relatives, etc., these supporting roles are too homogeneous. In fact, there is no need to type subtitles for every person who appears, nor do you need to give everyone equal time. &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;span>;Such a passing character and hasty explanation of the ending give the second half a sense of deja vu, as if you have finished the plot and left work early, and the narrative is cohesive&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; span>;Compared with the first half, it can be regarded as loose prose. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;To use a common saying to describe the impression of &quot;The Point of the Knife&quot;, it is that &quot;it is full of energy, then fades, and three times it is exhausted.&quot; The more you watch, the more discouraged you are, until it collapses thousands of miles. The film wants to portray the change of mentality of the triple agent.

From the perspectives of different narrators, it restores the ghost-catching past events in Qiuzhuang with different versions that are difficult to distinguish between true and false.

For commercial banks, in accordance with the relevant provisions of the &quot;Green Finance Evaluation Plan for Banking Financial Institutions&quot;, Southern Weekend New Finance Research Center will include green loan balance, growth rate, proportion, total issuance amount of green bonds, and underwriting scale into the banks in the 2023 Green Finance List List evaluation indicators. The total weight of the five third-level indicators in this dimension is 16%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;(2) Environmental contribution. Environmental contribution refers to the actual contribution and performance of financial institutions in environmental protection. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On the one hand, in order to promote the realization of the &quot;double carbon&quot; goal, various financial institutions have actively established green and low-carbon operating systems, formulated carbon emission targets for the future period, and established The carbon emission statistics platform calculates its own greenhouse gas emissions and per capita greenhouse gas emissions, analyzes its own carbon emission potential, and provides data support for low-carbon operation management. On the other hand, various financial institutions have established the concept of &quot;green operation office&quot; to reduce the impact of operating activities on the environment. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Southern Weekend New Financial Research Center combines publicly disclosed information and uses greenhouse gas emissions and per capita greenhouse gas emissions to examine the green and low-carbon operating systems of various financial institutions. Per capita energy consumption and per capita water consumption are used to measure the performance of each financial institution in green operations. Overall, the higher the environmental contribution of a financial institution, the better its green and low-carbon operations are, the less damage it causes to the environment, and the higher its carbon neutrality efficiency and energy utilization efficiency. The total weight of the four third-level indicators in this dimension is 8%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;(3) Social responsibility.

ESG governance here refers to whether financial institutions have established organizational structures and performance assessments that are compatible with green finance, environmental contribution and social responsibility. ESG performance is an important consideration for financial companies&#39; sustainable development capabilities, and ESG concepts have become an important concept for investors&#39; investment decisions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;More and more financial institutions have established ESG governance structures, set up specialized departments or offices to take charge of green finance and other work, and incorporated ESG-related indicators into their performance appraisal systems to Motivate employees to achieve better green financial performance. At the same time, listed companies are subject to ESG ratings by major rating agencies. This list uses MSCI rating results to measure the ESG governance performance of each financial institution, comprehensively reflecting the ESG performance of each financial institution in authoritative rating agencies.

For example, at the end of June 2023, the balance of ICBC&#39;s green loans reached 5 trillion yuan, accounting for more than 30% of the bank&#39;s total loans; state-owned banks are also at the forefront of the total green bond issuance and green bond underwriting amount indicators. For example, by the end of 2022, Bank of China’s green bond issuance amounted to 87.7 billion yuan, and its green bond underwriting amount was 453.9 billion yuan, ranking first. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In terms of ESG governance, the six major banks have all set up organizational structures and performance appraisal systems that are compatible with green finance. The latest ESG rating results announced by MSCI also All were A-level and received full marks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In the field of social responsibility, the six major banks all performed well in aspects such as aging-friendly services, issuance and promotion of electronic social security cards and electronic medical insurance vouchers, and received full marks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The difference is that the balance and proportion of ICBC green loans, the balance and proportion of agriculture-related loans, and the balance and proportion of manufacturing loans are The indicators ranked first among the four major banks. Although its total greenhouse gas emissions and per capita energy consumption are higher than the other three major banks in terms of environmental contribution, its overall ranking is still first. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Agricultural Bank of China’s green loan balance and manufacturing loan balance are second only to ICBC, but the growth rate of green loan balance is the fastest among the four major banks; at the same time, The bank&#39;s county-level green loan balance and proportion rank first among its peers. As of the end of June 2023, the bank&#39;s cumulative scale of carbon emission reduction loans issued and the reduction of carbon emissions it has driven are among the best among its peers. Although the overall score of Agricultural Bank of China is 5.25 points lower than that of ICBC, it is significantly ahead of the other two major state-owned banks, seizing the &quot;second spot&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Joint-stock banks: Xingye stands out&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Overall, joint-stock companies The green loan balance of banks is weaker than that of state-owned banks, and the average proportion of green loan balance is about 11%, which is far smaller than the 18% average of large state-owned banks. This shows that joint-stock banks are weak in green loans to support the development of green industries. At the same time, joint-stock banks rarely issue green bonds, and the average size of green bond underwriting is only about 1/10 of large state-owned banks, which also shows that joint-stock banks are weak in green financial products. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;But there are not no benchmarks among joint-stock banks. Industrial Bank performs well in indicators such as green loan balance, agriculture-related loan balance, manufacturing loan balance, and inclusive small and micro enterprise loan balance, all ranking among joint-stock banks. In Mingsheng ESG Ratings, Industrial Bank also ranks with the four Major banks also received an A grade. At the same time, Industrial Bank&#39;s competitiveness in the field of green finance has also been recognized by most review experts, and its number of votes in the field of green finance tied for first place with Industrial and Commercial Bank of China. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Therefore, Industrial Bank’s comprehensive score beat all banks, beating Bank of China with an advantage of 3.32 points, and was rated as the &quot;Green Finance Ranking of the Banking Industry&quot;.

Despite obvious disadvantages in terms of size and scale, Bank of Nanjing not only ranks first among city commercial banks in comprehensive scores by virtue of its share of indicators in terms of green loan balance, agriculture-related loan balance, and inclusive small and micro loan balance. The score even exceeds that of major state-owned banks and leading joint-stock banks that far exceed its own scale. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&lt;strong>;Serving the real economy&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;:&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;State-owned banks&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;do their best&lt; /strong>;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Overall, state-owned banks are members of the first echelon of social responsibilities, and the second and third echelons are joint-stock banks and city banks. commercial Bank. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;When examining the services of commercial banks to the real economy, Southern Weekend New Finance Research Center chose to measure the services of commercial banks to manufacturing loans and inclusive small and micro enterprise loans.

At these two levels, state-owned banks performed relatively well in terms of loan balance, growth rate and proportion. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Joint-stock banks perform well in pension finance and employee human capital development.

As a benchmark, nine life insurance companies were evaluated quantitatively and qualitatively from the four dimensions of economic performance, environmental performance, social performance and corporate governance, and fourteen sub-indicators were set, and different weights were given to each sub-indicator according to the difference in importance. The total weight of the above indicators accounts for 70%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;At the same time, the Southern Weekend New Financial Research Center comprehensively rated nine life insurance companies from the two dimensions of expert review and media factors (each accounting for 15% weight) , to build a green finance list for the insurance industry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;Green Finance List Life Insurance List Indicator System (Liang Shuyi, Liu Yuyu/Photo)&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11 /29/086e8a479b.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;2086&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/086e8a479b.png &quot; data-key=&quot;259952&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Green Finance List Life Insurance List Indicator System (Liang Shuyi, Liu Yuyu/Photo)&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The quantitative and qualitative indicators of the life insurance ranking index system are explained as follows:&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In the economic performance dimension, based on the scale of green investment , operating profit is measured by two third-level indicators. Green investment refers to investing in green industries or conducting green business activities, such as purchasing green bonds, green index funds, etc.; operating profit is used to measure a company&#39;s operating performance. In theory, it should be measured by green investment business income generation indicators. Taking into account actual information disclosure, operating profit replace. The total weight of the above two indicators is 10%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In the environmental performance dimension, total greenhouse gas emissions and per capita values ​​are core indicators, echoing the &quot;3060&quot; dual carbon goals.

The total weight of the above five indicators is 25%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The social performance dimension mainly sets three three-level indicators from the three perspectives of consumers, employees and communities: consumer complaint volume, employee turnover rate and charity investment measure. The total weight of the above indicators is 15%. Stakeholders such as governments and partners are not included because the information disclosure standards of each ESG report are different and comparability is poor. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Corporate governance dimension, set the number of core issues, MSCI rating, scope&lt;strong>;three&lt;/strong>; data disclosure, ESG reporting third party There are 4 third-level indicators of certification status. The total weight of the above four indicators is 20%. Among them, carbon emission scope three data is an important part of carbon emission accounting at the organizational level, including greenhouse gas emissions from upstream and downstream (value chain) activities related to corporate production. For service industries such as finance, business travel and employee commuting are the main components of Scope 3. However, due to greater accounting difficulties in this part, fewer life insurance companies proactively disclose it. In addition, although the insurance industry has paid more attention to ESG reporting, most ESG reports have not obtained third-party certification, so their objectivity and independence are questionable.

The former refers to the fact that Hengdian Film and Television Base is now dominated by the &quot;vertical screen short drama&quot; shooting team; the latter refers to the short drama application platform ReelShort, which has begun to conquer overseas markets and even topped the U.S. iOS entertainment list. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On November 22, the &quot;2023-2024 China Micro-Short Drama Market Research Report&quot; released by iiMedia Consulting showed that China&#39;s online short drama market size will be 37.39 billion yuan in 2023, a year-on-year increase of 267.65%. A total of 481 new short dramas were released in the first half of 2023, exceeding the level for the whole of 2022. It is estimated that the size of China&#39;s short drama market will reach 100.68 billion yuan in 2027. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The rise of short videos has not only reshaped the audio-visual habits of netizens, but also accommodated netizens’ search, shopping, entertainment, and social needs: from search engines to short video platforms, from TV series to Switching to short dramas, switching from playing online games to watching short videos, switching from e-commerce shopping to live streaming... &quot;Short Video+&quot; is profoundly affecting the ecology of the Internet industry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As a result, various major Internet platforms have derived new business models of &quot;short video + advertising&quot; and &quot;short video + e-commerce&quot;, which have greatly subverted the traditional profit model: ByteDance recently announced the contraction of its gaming business, Short videos are fully embraced; the time spent watching short videos by netizens has exceeded the time spent on online games; traditional online writers are rushing into new tracks; major film and television bases have turned into &quot;vertical screen versions&quot;... These phenomena show that the short video era has created a new era of short videos. The rise of the drama has also profoundly changed the overall ecology of the upstream and downstream industrial chains. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;2023 China Online Audiovisual Development Research Report&quot; shows that among the 1 billion short video users in 2022, about 50.4% of users have watched short dramas within 3 minutes. The size of the short drama market in 2023 will almost reach half of the national movie box office, creating many traffic miracles and myths of sudden wealth. For example, in September 2023, the traffic miracle of &quot;Wushuang&quot; exceeded 100 million in revenue in 8 days, which caused a sensation. , the myth of getting rich &quot;completed in one week, released in one month, and achieving financial freedom&quot; is also widely circulated. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The success of short plays is rooted in human nature, which is a deep need that people cannot erase. Human nature naturally loves &quot;refreshment&quot;, &quot;hate&quot; and &quot;relief&quot;, seeks emotional catharsis, and longs for emotional compensation. While the audience scolded the stereotyped short drama, they still couldn&#39;t help but finish watching a short drama with dozens of episodes before going to bed and experiencing the excitement of &quot;it turns out that success and love can come so quickly.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Short plays can often satisfy people&#39;s certain &quot;feelings&quot; and &quot;hit&quot; the inherent pleasure mechanism of human nature. Themes such as &quot;Grand grudges between wealthy families&quot;, &quot;Marriage first, love later&quot; and &quot;The domineering president fell in love with me&quot; are everlasting. Revenge, counterattack, the boss&#39;s sweet pet, a golden son-in-law, marrying into a wealthy family... Such plots are also repeated many times. Can&#39;t get tired of watching it. The protagonist of the short drama has either become an alternative Count of Monte Cristo, or a film and television version of &quot;Long Aotian&quot; or &quot;Mary Sue&quot;, or it seems to be the product of pressing shortcut keys on a long and drawn-out urban emotional drama. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Slightly different from the previous Internet ecology, the current industry supervision has become more and more synchronized, which is a new situation worthy of attention. The recent news that &quot;Tik Tok, Kuaishou, and WeChat platforms are jointly cracking down on illegal short dramas&quot; is also consistent with the fact that the State Administration of Radio, Film and Television has &quot;already removed 25,000 short dramas from the shelves. The next step will be to launch a one-month special rectification work on online short dramas.&quot; ” echoed the announcement. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It can be seen that the Internet industry has indeed been &quot;leading the way for three to five years.&quot; Past success may not be maintained for a long time in the face of new trends. The rise of short dramas with the help of short videos fully illustrates this point. At the same time, the &quot;reckless state&quot; of the Internet industry&#39;s barbaric growth and turf racing has passed, and the advancement of technology and industry and the follow-up of regulatory regulations are increasingly showing a &quot;same frequency&quot; state. In compliance with regulatory requirements, the pursuit of high-quality and high-quality content will still be the main focus of the short drama market in the future. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 29 Nov 2023 20:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[七百岁村庙的“一生”：东南最早元代建筑被发现]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261520]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-11-29 19:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/ image/23/11/29/9cbb99999f.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;706&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/ 29/9cbb99999f.png&quot; data-key=&quot;259937&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Overlooking Fook Sin Hall. Photographed by “Anonymous”&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Since I first saw Fook Sin Tong in 2017, I have never forgotten it. &quot;No name for now&quot; is his online name, and acquaintances call him &quot;No name for now.&quot; Even if the discovery of a Yuan Dynasty wooden building in the south was enough for him to leave his name in the history of architecture, he decided not to leave his name for the time being. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Walk around the mountains and rivers of Fujian for a while, just like visiting old friends, to look for the historical buildings hidden deep in the ancient villages and scattered along the ancient roads. His &quot;discovery&quot; of Fu Shan Tang was accidental, or it might be inevitable. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Fushan Hall is located in Zhengwei Village, Dikou Town, Jianou City, Fujian Province. It is a group of vernacular temple buildings, which conforms to the usual orientation rules of Chinese architecture: &quot;sitting Different from &quot;north to south&quot;, Fushan Hall conforms to the mountainous terrain of Zhengwei Village and faces south as a whole. The main hall is dedicated to the Three Treasures, and the left and right side halls are dedicated to Guanyin and King Dongping. It is a blend of Buddhism, Taoism and folk beliefs that are common in village temples. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The main hall faces a Qing Dynasty stage across the courtyard, and is integrated with the main hall through the corridor. Before the main hall was confirmed as a Yuan structure, the stage was the narrative center of the entire building complex. When people in the village talked about Fu Shan Tang, they would always talk about the story of the stage, but they were completely unaware of the main hall. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The &quot;discovery&quot; of Fu Shan Tang was not to find the existence of this building, but to confirm its identity as being built in the Yuan Dynasty. This time is July 18, 2023. That day, Liu Yan witnessed a &quot;highlight moment&quot; that has yet to come. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Liu Yanhe has traveled almost all over the landscapes of southern Zhejiang and northern Fujian for more than ten years. He studies woven wooden arcade bridges. An amazing bridge structure unique to the Fujian and Zhejiang mountains. The same interests led him to meet each other very early on, and they have been online friends for seven or eight years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Zhengweicun not only has Fushan Hall, but also has two covered bridges from the Qing Dynasty. In July 2023, Liu Yan took graduate students to survey and map in Zhengweicun Covered Bridge, I didn’t hear that they were in Fujian yet, so I drove here from Fuzhou, holding a newly purchased infrared camera in my hand. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Hundreds of years of burning paper and smoke, the beams of the main hall of Fu Shan Tang have been smoked black by the incense of believers. The inscriptions written by the ancients on the beams It is impossible to find it and can only be roughly dated based on its style. Using an infrared camera, it is possible to see traces of writing beneath the smoke. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/5e9396e852.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;1272&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/5e9396e852.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;259938&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In October 2023, instead of standing on the ladder, use an extended pole to connect the shooting instrument to observe the details of the components on the beams of Fushan Hall. Photo by Southern Weekend reporter Wang Huazhen&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;According to preliminary observations, the main structure of Fushantang Hall is relatively complete, with shuttle columns, column foundations, humps, and replacement wood etc. The obvious early features, such as the planar column network and frame beams, are quite similar to the main hall of Shunchang Baoshan Temple built in the 23rd year of Yuan Zhizheng (1363) with a stone imitation wood structure. Through rough dating of style, it is not possible to judge that the structure of Fushan Hall is no later than the early Ming Dynasty, and may even be in the Yuan Dynasty. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On that day, Liu Yan was not taken into Fushan Hall for the time being. While Liu Yan was still looking at the entire courtyard with unfamiliar eyes, he had already gone straight to the point and raised his infrared camera to identify the ink characters on Zhengliang. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;At first, Liu Yan didn&#39;t know what he saw through the infrared camera, because his expression didn&#39;t change much. He just raised his head to take a picture, and then lowered his head to confirm... Suddenly, he stopped getting excited. He held his breath, got excited, calmed down again, quickly checked on his mobile phone, and cautiously confirmed again. He no longer suppressed the ecstasy in his heart: &quot;Yuan Dynasty! The greatest!&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt; p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The inscription on the main beam shown in the infrared camera clearly reads: &quot;On the ninth day of the eighth month of Wushen, the first year of Wei Zhi&#39;s reign, Yiwei came to Fucheng... Congratulations for the reconstruction of the city...&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;On November 25, 2023, the UNESCO Representative Office in China and relevant government agencies of Fujian Province and Quanzhou City hosted the &quot;East Asian Wood Structure Building Protection and &quot;Utilizing International Academic Exchange Conference&quot;, at which Lou Jianlong, deputy director of Fujian Museum, gave a speech entitled &quot;Early Architecture and Characteristics of Fujian&quot;. During his speech, Lou Jianlong mentioned Fu Shan Tang. This may be the first time that Fu Shan Tang has been officially recognized as a newly discovered Yuan Dynasty building and mentioned at an international conference. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The existing main structure of Fushan Hall was founded in the first year of the Great Rebellion, that is, 1307. Before it, the earliest known Yuan Dynasty wooden structure in southeastern China was the Yanfu Temple in Wuyi, Zhejiang, built in 1317, the fourth year of Yanyou in the Yuan Dynasty. The newly confirmed Fushan Hall in Zhengwei Village has now become the earliest Yuan structure in the southeast. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Cheng - the &quot;hedge&quot; of two time differences&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Zhengwei Village, where Fushan Hall is located, is located among the mountains in northern Fujian middle. The ancestor of the Zheng family who came to the village was Zheng Hao from the Song Dynasty. Zheng Fawang, secretary of the village branch, took out a photocopy of the &quot;Genealogy of the Zheng Family&quot; compiled during the Wanli Period of the Ming Dynasty, which recorded the story of the Zheng family&#39;s entry into Fujian and their reproduction in Jianzhou. The first ancestor of this Zheng family to migrate to Fujian was Zheng Shu during the Five Dynasties period. By Zheng Hao, it was already the eighth generation. According to the genealogy, Zheng Hao decided to move here after taking a fancy to the Feng Shui of Zhengwei Village. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Walking around the village, even a person who doesn&#39;t understand Feng Shui can easily see that the terrain of this village is indeed a bit special. Surrounded by two mountains like an armchair, the village &quot;sits&quot; safely in the mountain col between the two armrests. The opening of the armchair faces north, and a small stream flows through the entrance of the village, blocking the village in the mountain col. Fu Shan Tang is located in the west of the village - at the foot of the west armrest of the &quot;armchair&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/fdd66b33c4.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;810&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/fdd66b33c4.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;259939&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Looking northeast from Fushan Hall, Zhengwei Village has a panoramic view. Under the setting sun, the rammed earth walls of folk houses in northern Fujian turn golden. Photo by Southern Weekend reporter Wang Huazhen&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Although the old people in the village do not understand architecture, they have passed down from generation to generation that Fushan Hall was built by a man named Zhang Fushan in the Song Dynasty. Before Zheng came to the village, the main families in the village were Zhang and Wei. I don’t think this legend is likely to be an attachment, but Fushan Hall was probably built in the Song Dynasty, because the inscription mentions “reconstruction”. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In 2021, Zhou Miao met Fu Shan Tang for the first time. He stayed there for a long time, &quot;it was really beyond imagination,&quot; he recalled his feelings at that time to the Southern Weekend reporter. He is a young teacher in the Department of Architecture of Zhejiang City University and is fond of ancient dwellings in northern Fujian and southern Zhejiang. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Liang Sicheng, in &quot;The History of Chinese Architecture in Pictures&quot;, described the three periods of existing ancient architecture in China from the perspective of the history of artistic styles. The architecture of the Tang Dynasty was &quot;grand. &quot;Jing&quot; became &quot;mellow&quot; from the Song and Yuan Dynasties to the early Ming Dynasty, and &quot;straight&quot; during the Ming and Qing Dynasties. Zhou Miao&#39;s research focuses on the transformation of architecture in the Tang and Song Dynasties. When he saw Fushan Hall, his professional intuition told him that the combination of columns, beams, and brackets had a &quot;Song style&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In this era, to be able to find a metastructure in the humid south is a rare thing for any architectural scholar. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In the field of ancient architecture, there is a saying that &quot;Look to Shanxi in the north and Fujian in the south.&quot; The quantity, quality and density of preserved ancient buildings in these two provinces are far behind. more than other provinces. But Fujian is more unique than Shanxi. &quot;Shanxi is close to the Central Plains and the capitals of past dynasties, and the overall evolution of architecture has been relatively synchronized with the Central Plains dynasties. Maybe some styles have changed in the Central Plains, and Shanxi will also change in about 50 years.&quot; But Fujian is different, especially in the mountainous areas of northern Fujian and southern Zhejiang. , the development of architecture lags behind. If we see a style from the Song Dynasty there, it may be as late as the early Ming Dynasty. &quot;So when we see a house in Fujian with a fairly old style, we dare not make a judgment.&quot; Zhou Miao said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;However, Jian&#39;ou, located in the upper reaches of the Min River, is a mountainous area, but it was the first area in Fujian to be developed by Han immigrants. In 206 AD, the Sun Wu regime established Jian&#39;an County, the first county-level administrative region in Fujian history, in today&#39;s Jianou. Until the Song Dynasty, Jianzhou, centered on Jianou, was the cultural center of Fujian. At that time, Jianban books were popular all over the world, and Zhu Xi&#39;s Neo-Confucianism was also nurtured here. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Zhou Miao later realized that although the mountainous areas of northern Fujian further north were developed very late, the narrow valley area in the upper reaches of the Min River was not too late. Specific to the style of architecture, there may also be a &quot;time difference&quot; between the Jian&#39;ou area and other northern Fujian areas. This time difference &quot;hedges&quot; the time difference between northern Fujian and the Central Plains. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;Weird power confuses the gods,&quot; Liu Yan said, pointing to the intricately carved cat beams and dou bao on the beams of Fushan Hall. Based on this intuition, he also boldly speculated that Fushan Hall was built in the Yuan Dynasty. &quot;It feels like it is earlier than the Ming Dynasty, but it is unlikely to be in the Song Dynasty. Because both the Song and Ming Dynasties tend to be orthodox and regular. Only the buildings of the Yuan Dynasty can have this kind of unconventional and unconventional style.&quot; Weird and weird approach.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/a94ef1b375.jpg&quot; border= &quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;810&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/a94ef1b375.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;259940&quot;>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The beams of Fushan Hall are carved with complicated and strange cat beams and fighting arms. Photo by Southern Weekend reporter Wang Huazhen&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;I will not write my discovery into a public account article for the time being. After posting it, I refused all media interviews, &quot; He feels that he has completed his historical mission,&quot; Liu Yan said. In October 2023, Liu Yan completed the surveying and mapping task of the covered bridge project. Before returning to his workplace, Kunming University of Science and Technology, he decided to go to Fushan Hall again to conduct the first surveying and mapping of it. &quot;Do you want to come? Maybe you will come for the time being. We may be able to persuade him to accept an interview.&quot; He asked the Southern Weekend reporter. At the end of October, Southern Weekend reporters met Fu Shan Tang and its discoverer, and also watched Liu Yan&#39;s team conduct a brief survey and mapping of Fu Shan Tang. What impressed me deeply was not only the building itself, but also the people who were bound by Fuk Sen Tang. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Living - &quot;Growth&quot; in the eyes of architectural archeology&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Witnessing the discovery of Fushantang with her own eyes made Liu Yan feel that there was a kind of destiny The fate is inside. He is currently writing a series of studies on buildings &quot;sitting south and facing north&quot;. This architectural form that &quot;conflicts&quot; with the norm fascinates him. Fushantang appeared at this time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Liu Yan studied for a PhD in &quot;Architectural Archeology&quot; in Germany, and &quot;fine surveying&quot; is the core tool in this field. For a large building, complete architectural archeology may take several years, even decades. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;In Germany, where Liu Yan studied, precision surveying and mapping is a &quot;basic plan&quot; for carrying out cultural preservation work. &quot;There are no levels of cultural preservation in Germany. As long as it is cultural preservation, it is necessary to do such a complete and in-depth survey and mapping.&quot; Liu Yan said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;A scholar of architectural archeology may not be able to do a few cases of precise surveying and mapping in his lifetime. Liu Yan&#39;s German mentor spent thirty years of his energy on a church. For the country, “this set of things is too luxurious. There are only a handful of cases across the country that can achieve the depth of architectural archeology through precise surveying and mapping. In Fujian, even the Luoyuan and Chen Taiwei Palace built in the Song Dynasty may not have been built yet.” Do enough mapping to match his identity,&quot; Liu Yan said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Architectural archeology is an emerging discipline in China. Liu Yan vividly described archeology as digging down layer by layer, &quot;and their strata are spread horizontally.&quot; Architectural archeology discussed the overlapping historical layers in above-ground buildings. For example, a Song Dynasty building was replaced in the Ming Dynasty. A certain component, a corridor was added in the Qing Dynasty... Just like archeology, there are also &quot;strata&quot; layer by layer. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/6c5fd28f5c.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot; 1080&quot; height=&quot;719&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/6c5fd28f5c.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;259941&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The interior of the main hall of Fuxiantang.

Renovated.&quot; At the scene, Southern Weekend reporters were not given a detailed explanation of this development: there is an inscription from the Hongzhi Year of the Ming Dynasty under the purlin in the front of the main hall, an inscription from the Kangxi reign of the Qing Dynasty under the porch, and an inscription from the Jiaqing reign of the Qing Dynasty in the side hall. , the stage shows the style of the late Qing Dynasty. The main hall itself contains different components and structures from the Yuan, Ming and Qing dynasties, not to mention the rich &quot;strata&quot; overlapping of the entire building complex. &quot;Using &#39;Yuan to Qing&#39; to describe the age of Fushan Hall is more accurate and closer to the essence of architectural heritage.&quot; I don&#39;t think so yet. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Liu Yan said that architectural archeology is &quot;architectural detective science.&quot; Through comprehensive collection of on-site clues, architects can find subtle changes in buildings in the river of time, thereby inferring social and personnel changes in the past dynasties. This is what he wants to do to Fuxiantang. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;&quot;What the early Architecture Society did was architectural archeology, but at that time the focus of scholars&#39; work was still to find the earliest buildings, and to find Tang Gou structures. , Looking for Song Gou, I can’t wait to peel off all the historical coverage of the Ming and Qing Dynasties.” Liu Yan said. The main hall of Hualin Temple in Fuzhou is such a classic representative. &quot;The original survey map did not even record the Qing Dynasty corridor. During the restoration and repair, the Qing Dynasty corridor was directly demolished.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style =&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Today&#39;s architectural archeology is different from the pursuits of early scholars. On the one hand, it pursues more detailed surveying and mapping, and on the other hand, it pays more attention to the &quot;life story&quot; of a building - the completeness of a building. The life narrative of a city not only focuses on its &quot;first construction&quot; or &quot;original&quot; youthful and heroic appearance, but also understands its changes through the ages and its life state until its twilight years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;To understand the &quot;growth&quot; of Fu Shan Tang, we must not only start with the building itself, but also the historical environment where the building is located is also a key factor. Before the road was opened, the only way to enter and exit Zhengwei Village was through an ancient post road across a mountain stream. The ancient post road was connected to covered bridges. There was a covered bridge, Xian&#39;en Bridge, at the entrance of the village, and a covered bridge, Desheng Bridge, at the end of the village. The two covered bridges marked the entrance. The only access to the village. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;The ancient post road was paved with wide stone slabs. &quot;The ancient road was so wide, it can be seen that the village itself had financial resources in ancient times.&quot; Liu Yan speculated. There are two more covered bridges next to the village. &quot;Those who have the ability to build covered bridges must be because the village is located on an important passage. It may be an important trade route in ancient times. People must pass through here to have the motivation to build it.&quot; Such a large covered bridge.&quot; Zhou Miao said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;What surprised Zhou Miao even more was the Ming Dynasty residences in Zhengwei Village. &quot;It is already a great thing to have Ming Dynasty residences in a village, and Zhengwei Village There may be more than five or six Ming Dynasty residences, and there are also many exquisite Qing Dynasty residences, which shows that this village has been prosperous for a long time. Its population reproduction and wealth accumulation must far exceed that of other surrounding villages.&quot; The accumulation of wealth has made Fushantang Large-scale reconstruction was carried out in the Yuan Dynasty, and during the Ming and Qing Dynasties, there was the possibility of continuous growth, with side halls, corridors, and stages...&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http ://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/bf8914da2f.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;1188&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm .com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/bf8914da2f.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;259942&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;福There is a stone tablet next to the entrance of the charity hall, which is engraved with the &quot;Yicang Stele&quot; written in the 50th year of Qianlong&#39;s reign. It has a chronicle on the front and a name on the back. According to this monument, there was originally a Mingjiao temple not far from Zhengwei Village. After it was abandoned, the villagers reclaimed the land and set up a charity warehouse in Fushan Hall, which could not only support the village, but also invest in public affairs, just like the current charity foundation.

The towering ancient trees in the surrounding mountains are the village&#39;s greatest wealth. In ancient times, villagers cut down trees and put the wood into the river. Following the water flow, they arrived in Fuzhou. Until the reform and opening up, the village had always been an important part of the timber industry chain in northeastern Fujian. &quot;We still have land in Fuzhou, and we were relatively wealthy at that time.&quot; Zheng Fawang said that his ancestors were also engaged in the timber business. His ancestral house was built in the late Qing Dynasty and is located in the middle of Zhengwei Village. It is also a tall building. A mansion with deep walls. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;By combining clan power with industry, the Zheng clan controls large areas of surrounding mountains and forests. Now several surrounding villages are also dominated by the Zheng surname. In ancient times, it was the &#39;sphere of influence&#39; of Zhengwei Village.&quot; said Zheng Jinlan, a staff member of the Dikou Town Cultural Station. Her hometown is in a village not far from Zhengwei Village, and her family&#39;s Zheng surname is derived from Zhengwei Village. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Bad - As long as there are people’s activities, the buildings will be changed&lt;/h4>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Walking in the alleys of the village, there were once tall ancient houses on both sides , many of which are only ruins. Not long after the Bailu solar term passed, a red paper notice for &quot;Bailu Tomb Sweeping&quot; was posted on the notice board in the village. It read &quot;Guimao Year, Bawu Cemetery&quot; - Bawu Gong was Zheng Hao. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Different from the general Qingming tomb sweeping, Zhengwei Village arranges ancestor worship and sweeping in the Bailu solar term every year. This custom is said to have lasted for hundreds of years. According to the villagers, during the white dew, the water comes out and the water steps in the stream are easier to walk, so it was decided to visit the tomb at this time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;Fushantang plays the role of the faith center in the small regional community centered on Zhengwei Village. When women in the village reach the age of 60, they will go to Fushan Hall to hold a grand ceremony, wearing special cyan clothes and bright red flowers on their heads, &quot;just like primary school students registering at school when they are old.&quot; Zheng Fawang said that the local People call them Qingyi Zhaipo.

They chanted sutras, burned incense and chatted. Fun, bask in the sun, laugh and laugh, and cover the scriptures. Obviously, the religious space has become a public space. During the days when they read the scriptures, they temporarily left their families and spent a period of time with their sisters without trouble.

The architectural history of this temple has also been more than 200 years. The temple&#39;s beam reads the inscriptions during the Jiaqing period of the Qing Dynasty. In the afternoon of the day, the villagers carried the idols and swim in the whole village. Finally, it went to the Fushan Hall on the left of the village. In the face of the Fushan Hall, everyone put the idol. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Fourteen and fifteen days is a lively scene of the drama. The show is for God, of course, the mountain people in Shili and Eight Township can also look at it.

He found that many temples in Shanxi, especially the older and early, have been controlled by the cultural relics department, and the incense has gradually been cut off. The relationship between local residents and it is getting more and more alienated. &quot;The building and the life of people here are still closely related. The traditional sacrifice ritual, space, and belief habits can still be bound to this settlement and this building.&quot; &lt;/P>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align : LEFT; &quot;>; In 1951, Zheng Weicun Elementary School was founded in Fushan Hall with dozens of students. In 1960, Fu Shantang was opened as a public canteen. Unlike the Shanxi Village Temple, the policy relaxed after the reform and opening up, and Fushan Hall soon became the center of Zhengwei Village&#39;s belief activities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; However, faith activities and ancient construction protection seem to be a difficult contradiction. After the discovery of the Fushan Hall, the leaders of the Provincial Bureau of Cultural Relics have repeatedly instructed Zheng Fangwang Fushan Hall. Zhou Miao remembered that in the 30th year of 2019, a burst of fire in the ancient gallery bridge of Jian&#39;ou City, &quot;because there are too many people burning incense on the bridge that day.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; As long as there are people&#39;s activities, the building will be changed. Sometimes this change is slow, growing slowly like Fu Shantang, and human activities are gently scrued like waves. But some fierce changes have been common in recent years. In early November 2023, it was not found that the Village, Gutian County, Fujian, was built in the 12th year of Ming Hongzhi (1499) in the 12th year of Ming Hongzhi (1499). &quot;Donkey is not a monster.&quot; Villagers have money and want to rebuild the ancestral temple. It is common for the ancestral ancestral temple, but I don&#39;t think this is a non -matching level of cultural and economic level. Until before being demolished by the villagers, it was neither cultural relic nor a historic building, and there was no protection identity at all. &quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>; &lt;span>; empty-what to leave &lt;/span>; &lt;/h4>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Before the founding of New China, Zheng Weicun was armed by his own forces Village. At the most, there are more than a hundred guns in the village, like a small army. Until now, the streets in the village are still posted on the slogan of &quot;hiding guns and not allowing the law&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;img alt = &quot;&quot; src = &quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/1b56481471.jpg&quot; border = &quot;0&quot; width = &quot; 1080 &quot;height =&quot; 1192 &quot;data-src =&quot; // Images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/1b56481471.jpg &quot;data- key =&quot; 259945 &quot;>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p STYLE = &quot;COLOR: #999999; Text-Align: Center;&quot;>; In October 2023, the slogan posted on the streets of Zhengwei Village.

Large -scale armed. Many people speculated that at that time, Zheng Weicun controlled the nearby mountains, and Zheng was the local family. In the troubled times, the clan was self -defense. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; In the spring of 1936, the Communist Party of China established the Town of Jianqiakou as the center, including Jian&#39;er, Songxi, Zhenghe, Gutian, northeast Fujian, northeast Fujian. Guerrilla base. The villagers were quickly combined with the northeast Fujian guerrillas to become a reliable backup of guerrillas. As the villagers of Zhengwei Village are very familiar with firearms, the Zheng&#39;s Ancestral Hall in the center of the village naturally became the guerrilla firearm repair plant. Today, the pentagram above the main entrance of the shrine was the sign of the firearm repair plant in Northeast Fujian guerrillas at that time. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;img alt = &quot;&quot; src = &quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/16c28ba.jpg&quot; border = &quot;0&quot; width = &quot; 1080 &quot;height =&quot; 1360 &quot;data-src =&quot; // Images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/16fb3c28ba.jpg &quot;data- key =&quot; 259946 &quot;>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p STYLE = &quot;COLOR: #999999; Text-Align: Center;&quot;>; Zheng Weicun&#39;s Zheng&#39;s ancestral temple.

On May 13, 1948, Zeng Jingbing, Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee of the Chinese and Zhejiang and Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee of the Communist Party of China, and more than 200 guerrilla members watched Gan opera with local villagers in Fushantang. Later, Fu Shantang became a general cultural relic. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;>;1982年，村民对福善堂大殿局部修缮，据暂不观察，当时的用料粗陋细小，“与原构相去甚远”， It may be that the conditions are too limited. In 2017, Zheng Weicun obtained the protection of the &quot;traditional Chinese village&quot;. The Fushan Hall and Porcelain Porcelain were repaired local. In 1982, the components that did not meet the specifications were replaced, and the roof was also renovated. Now in the temple, the light -colored wood is replaced in 2017, and the difference between the dark and old materials is clearly distinguished. It is this cautious repair that keeps many questions in Foshantang in Mo Shu&#39;s titles in mind. Until six years, you will not carry infrared cameras to visit again ... &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left; &quot;>; Compared to Yu&#39;s Ancestral Temple, the Fushan Hall is lucky.

The removal of Yu&#39;s ancestral temple, as well as Anxi Baofengyan (during the Ming Yongle period), Zhangping Longjian Palace (1482), Youxi Zhuo&#39;s Temple (During the Ming Dynasty), Datian Hongnong Temple (Ming Chenghua to Hongzhi period ), Yongtai Xianpu Realm (1513) ... Most of them have no protection identity. &quot;They have a very accurate and complete sorting of historical buildings.&quot; Liu Yan and Zhou Miao have a lot of contact with local ancient building enthusiasts in Fujian. Compared with official statistics, they sometimes rely on these people material. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; &quot;One problem now is that many local governments are actually unwilling to bear this risk, knowing that it is a valuable cultural relic, but it is not willing to report it. The situation exists. &quot;Zheng Jinlan told the reporter from the southern weekend. As long as it is not reported as a cultural relic point, no one needs to be responsible after being damaged. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Protecting as many ancient architectural samples as possible is the basis for scholars to conduct systematic research. What is the position of Fu Shantang in the Yuan Dynasty architecture? Zhou Miao, who specializes in the Song and Yuan architecture, is difficult to say, &quot;because there are too few Yuan Dynasty architecture in the south.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; The Yuan Dynasty buildings in the north are relatively retained, and in specific areas, the number can be analyzed as much as possible. &quot;In the north, it can be a level distinction of architecture in the Yuan Dynasty to comment on what different levels look like.&quot; Zhou Miao said. If Fushan Hall is placed in the northern yuan structure, then it is undoubtedly the level of low -level village Buddhist temples, but its hall is much larger than ordinary villages and temples. &quot;After the Northern Yuan Dynasty The combination of the structure of low -level buildings began to become messy, mixed, or messy and not particular about it. But the regulation and order of Foshantang are still pretty good, which is unexpected. &quot; /p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; The Hall of Foshan Hall has gone through the storm of history, and now it is facing the empty nest of the countryside. Before the 1950s, there were more than 500 households in the village. Nowadays, there are only less than 800 people left in Zhengwei Village, and the entire administrative village (including 6 natural villages in the surrounding are). &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Behind ancient buildings are not only discoverers and researchers, but also users who are closely related to them. After the logging industry disappeared, the village was in fact. The entire village costs about 200,000 yuan a year. The salary of the village committees and the village&#39;s sanitary expenses are sometimes difficult to guarantee. There are no young people in the village. After this generation of Tsing Yi Zhai&#39;s death, the daily maintenance and use of Fushantang is likely to lose activity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Liu Yan is also very interested in the rituals and costumes of Tsing Yi Zhai, as well as the village&#39;s drama class. &quot;This village seems to have a kind of magic, which can retain so many ancient things.&quot; He plans to investigate and surveys and mapping again next year&#39;s winter vacation and summer vacation, and &quot;soak&quot; in the local area for a long time to do the field survey of real architecture anthropology. &quot;It is more interesting to combine people and architecture.&quot; He also understands that if he does not record as soon as possible, the whole cultural system around Fu Shantang will disappear. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Jian&#39;er&#39;s &quot;upgrade&quot; movement of Fu Shantang is unfolding. Originally, Fushantang was just a general cultural protection point, and even the county insurance was not. Now it is promoted by &quot;cross -level&quot;. You can do a promotion work. &quot;Zheng Jinlan said. The provincial insurance is prepared for the future of the national security. &quot;The southern wood structure of the Yuan Dynasty will definitely enter the national insurance.&quot; Liu Yan said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;text-align: left;&quot;>; Qingyi Zhai&#39;s daily lesson will definitely be affected by the upgrading of cultural relics protection levels. Zheng Fawang intends to prepare a tripod for them outside the temple so that the fragrant candle will no longer enter the hall. After bidding farewell to Qingyi Zhai, Liu Yanhe did not continue to drive north to visit Yunfeng Temple in Mountain Mountain. For the time being, it is a national security building in the west and east. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 29 Nov 2023 19:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[《再见爱人》：婚姻里谁都没错，日子怎么就没法过]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/261541]]><description> &lt;div>; &lt;i>; 2023-11-29 18:00:00 &lt;/i>; &lt;/div>; &lt;p>; &lt;img src = &quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/23/ 11/29/92i6yai3L2S2KIC36TXISOT8B4Meqevr9idfu0kz.jpg &quot;Border =&quot; 0 &quot;width =&quot; 640 &quot;height =&quot; 960 &quot;data-src =&quot; // Images.infzm/cms/medias/i MAGE/23/11/29/92i6YAI3L2S2KIC36TXISOT8B4MEQEVR9idfu0kz. jpg &quot;data-key =&quot; 260006 &quot;>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style =&quot; color: #999; text-align: center; &quot;>;&quot; Goodbye lover &quot;producer Liu Le &lt;span style =&quot; color: #aaaaaaa ; &quot;(Provided by the interviewee/picture) &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot; Goodbye Lover &quot;achieved the third season, producer Liu Le finally realized the dream when he proposed the plan -with the guests Enter the Civil Affairs Bureau for a day. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The Office of the Civil Affairs Bureau of Aheqi County is less than 200 square meters, and marriage and divorce are completed here.

The guest of the observation room, Hu Yanbin, told her: &quot;If the parting is not so terrible, we have such a deep care and such a good wish for each other, and we have such a decent difference, then I also long for marriage.&quot; &lt;/P>; &lt;p>; &quot; After the third season of the Lover &quot;, Liu Le accepted our interview, telling the joy, bitterness and human nature of the show related to the show since the three seasons. &lt;/p>; &lt;H4>; Can&#39;t you divorce if you don&#39;t quarrel? &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; Southern Character Weekly: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_gb2312, stkaiti;&quot;>; &quot;Goodbye lover&quot; to the third season, still touching can still be touched What is yours? &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; Liu Le: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span>; This season&#39;s most shocked me is the sense of misunderstanding of Seoul and Lao Liu. Before I came, I told me, can I not quarrel, can I do it? I said who said &quot;Goodbye Lover&quot; to quarrel, and if you don&#39;t make noisy. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; When we went to the Civil Affairs Bureau, the director asked why he couldn&#39;t survive and what happened? Do you not go home? Is it drinking? Do you hit you? He has a lot of &quot;clinical experiments&quot; experience, and these problems he raised are very gold -content. When we hear other people&#39;s divorce in daily life, we will ask what is the problem. If he said that there was no problem, why would he divorce? Good days. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The inertia thinking of many people must be derailed. I have to lie to me, and I can divorce. no. So our main concept this season is painful and grows slowly. I can&#39;t tell what it has. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; When the first few episodes were broadcast, everyone might feel whether it was moaning without illness, is it to say that she was worried, it was to make a set of words on the show. Like Seoul, the first half and the second half of the broadcast, I have seen some public accounts. At the beginning, I wrote that Fu Shouer must be here to make money, and she would definitely not divorce. After a few episodes, there was a public account, and Fu Shier must have been here to make money, because she had already planned to leave. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; How do you know her, this is also the most difficult place to persuade Seoul. Everyone will wonder if she is utilitarian. I told her, if you are willing to face your real dilemma, you will come. This sound will not dissipate. The most important point for persuading her is that she has real emotional demands. The marriage of more than ten years has been rooted in her heart. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; I have known her for several years. When I was still in &quot;Happy Camp&quot;, she came to be my guest. She said that I was particularly envious of your state, a state of falling in love at any time. I said, do you encounter any confusion in marriage? I talked to her. After doing &quot;Goodbye Lover&quot;, she often sent me some look after the first two seasons. I think what she said actually took her with her. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Seoul&#39;s defense is very strong. She will protect herself and want to talk about it, but she will not speak very thoroughly. It looks like he is, but there must be a sore in her heart that I want to make everyone happy, and I really want to dig this thing. After the second season, I mentioned to her, there must be a process of persuasion. I told her that if you are determined, everything is not a matter. The problem is the problem, but it can be solved. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; My judgment is that she will face it sooner or later, not to say that she must come to the show, but she has a lot of knots in her heart, and she can&#39;t solve it through chatting with friends. On the one hand, she wants to seek change, and on the other hand, she is also eager to be understood by more people. She still has a large part of the &quot;old script&quot;. I have been married for more than ten years. Everyone has not made any mistakes. We have done our best. Why is it not good? If so, can we choose to separate? I feel that she and Lao Liu are both trapped. In this case, she couldn&#39;t really reconcile, so that she was willing to spread everything to everyone. Can it be understood? She is so eager to be understood, her pioneer is old, active and passive, and is a very charming contradiction. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; I hope that one day she can accept her true trap and not go closer to another kind of life. This may be easier, but Seoul is a person who is not easy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;img src = &quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/l2mmkm7vnufwoevollb9gcugv5gjit.jpg&quot; border = &quot;0&quot; widt h = &quot;960&quot; height = &quot;640&quot; data-src = &quot;// Images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/l2mmkm7vnufwoevollb9gcu4sfugv5gjit.jpg&quot; data- &quot;>; 260011&quot;>; &lt;/p. >; &lt;p style = &quot;coloror : #999; Text-Align: Center; &quot;>; In the third season of&quot; Goodbye Lover &quot;, six guests celebrate the 14th anniversary of Fu Shier and Liu Yi&#39;s wedding &lt;span style =&quot; color: #aaa; &quot;>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>; Do not separate easily, nor do it dying &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; Southern Character Weekly: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_ GB2312, Stkaiti; &quot;>; How did the other two pairs of guests find it? &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; Liu Le: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span>; The other two pairs are all registered by themselves. Wang Shiqing signed up in the second season, but at that time, I talked to her. She didn&#39;t have such a big contradiction like this season. This year, I felt much much. After opening the closed state of last year, entering a dynamics will bring a lot of severe impact. If the relationship itself is very good, this dynamics may make you better. If it is not good, it will be accelerated. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; There are more opportunities to work in Shiqing. Obviously, I feel that I seem to be stronger. &quot;. And the person who wants to hold me, his movements have become more obvious. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Wang signed up after the second season. At that time, many quarrels of Zhang Wanting and Song Ningfeng made her think of herself. She felt that she also liked scolding and unhappy, so she filled in the registration form. The earliest information about them did not show so many problems as showing in the show. In the first round of contact, many directors judged that they were garlic. The problem was too fine. Extension space and so on. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; I said that what will happen is to be really worthy of extension? Will the show team trapped by a so -called heart that wants to pursue texture? Is it too fascinated on the presentation of intimate relationships, too fascinating those things that are invisible, unable to touch, and unclear, and those things that can be clear, touched, caught, and can directly judge whether they are right or wrong. Are we excluded from we? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; We reflected. In the first season, Zhu Yaqiong said a lot of feelings, but in the end it was remembered that the hug of that minute. Still implementation on specific events. Specific incidents can make people start, and they can reflect on whether they have such behavior and better establish a comparison coordinate system, so we set them. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Many people say that &quot;Goodbye Lover&quot; is to rely on fierce quarrels to attract attention. No, the show group does not want to be endless. That thing makes people despair and suffocate. But because it is a reality show, once they start, we cannot interfere. We can&#39;t go up and tell them not to quarrel. You quickly give me good reconciliation, and it is impossible to tell them that you two can start to quarrel now. This is too ridiculous. What we can do is to record truthfully. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; What topics do the flying guests join in and what new projects can be done. These can be invisible into the journey and trigger their changes. Other do not know what the game they would blow up at all, and which sentence made him angry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; You see Zhang Shuo sent a WeChat to the best man at the time &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_GB2312, stkaiti;&quot;>; The quarrel, the two were unhappy. Then they quarreled because of other things. At this time, Zhang Shuo sent a WeChat to the best man to try to alleviate the contradiction with sleeping) &lt;/span>;. The most real feeling at that moment was that it was good to do so well. It must be able to recover: She was angry because of other things, and I immediately did something to make up for this. But it was because he did these things that the audience intuitively felt that his model was to dismantle the east wall to make up the west wall, and the disassembly was not good, and the supplement was not good. The whole person was very perfunctory. Is this perfunctory social normal? yes. So it triggered the greatest resonance. The quarrel can only let everyone look at the excitement, but the pain behind the quarrel can be left after the lively. It is a point of empathy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; I think Zhang Shuo still represents a very common phenomenon: I don&#39;t need to make this matter 100 points, I will always control my efforts, just do 10 points, 20 points, 20 points, 20 points Just be fine, lying flat anywhere, whether he is working, social or love. Huang Zhizhong was right, he was very stinging his energy. Now I have paid 10 points. If you do n’t admit that my 10 -point value, I ’m not happy. Is this selfish? of course. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; So the hot search of &quot;mirror of society&quot; behind Zhang Shuo, I think the audience can also feel very intuitive how weak this emotional model is for contemporary young people. Why don&#39;t so many people want to fall in love? Everyone said that I don&#39;t need to be so full, if love is not deeply loved. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In fact, Zhang Shuo has many advantages. We are angry with him, but we can&#39;t hate it. He is really a kind child, and he takes care of the surrounding emotions very much. But why is this mode of intimacy? The show has been exploring, and the observation room is also talking. (One of the reasons may be) people are eager for positive feedback, which is a physiological mechanism. If I do something wrong, I hope to get some suggestions, rather than being questioned whether it is wrong? No one likes to be pumped by the whip. After pumping, I may do worse. This is a behavioral mechanism. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; Southern Character Weekly: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_GB2312, stkaiti;&quot;>; The show barrage many write &quot;Sleeping and Run&quot;, Everyone can&#39;t understand why they have to be together. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; Liu Le: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span>; I think the audience has seen a presentation directly, and I feel that I do n’t break up like this? But as a sleeping, this person is my first love. I have been together for 10 years. He used to be very good to me. It is not easy to be separated. When you encounter a problem, you must still want to solve it first. What exactly changed? Can I change it? &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; People have hope, this is a very positive thing. In the past, most of the people took the other extreme. No matter how hard it was, no matter how tired, and how much grievances, we had to live this life without divorce. Now the new trend is: a little wrong, worship immediately. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;Goodbye Lover&quot; has always wanted to find a middle balance, neither separate separation nor dragging. We want to have the ability that can be left and repaired, maybe this is a more sound love. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; I believe that for Wang&#39;s sleep, when she decided to come to the show, she just wanted to give this relationship a last chance. If they can be good, continue, and they will be separated. In the process, every sway, anger, and soft heart are extremely sincere, and she is trying to re -recognize the person. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; Southern Character Weekly: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_GB2312, stkaiti;&quot;>; Zhang Shuo&#39;s behavior caused a lot controversy. What is his feedback? &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; Liu Le: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span>; He is very painful. It feels that the self is completely shattered and denied all aspects. During the broadcast, he will come to discuss with us from time to time. Basically, it is self -provoking. I think this is very difficult. No one can truly acknowledge that they are a bad person. This is a cruel thing, and it takes time, but we see that Zhang Shuo has been working hard. He is still an exploration gesture. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Zhang Shuo is a very sunny person in the show, and he can find fun for himself. Regardless of whether these public opinion is correct or not, he has a great impact on him. He was painful and had to admit that some comments might make sense. Just like people want to digest the knife, a knife is already in the flesh. It is cutting my tumor, which is painful and must endure. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;img src = &quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/nlyvekva0EQTXGRSUPSLEL6WYAAZCQ6ut.jpg&quot; 0 &quot;width = &quot;960&quot; height = &quot;640&quot; data-src = &quot;// Images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/nlyvekva0eqtxgrsupslel6wyprru1fvaazcq6ut.jpg&quot; data-key = &quot;260013&quot;>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;color : #999; Text-Align: Center; &quot;>;&quot; Goodbye Lover &quot;Season 3 Guest Wang Sleeping (left) and Zhang Shuo &lt;span style =&quot; color: #aaa; &quot;>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt; p>; &lt;strong>; Southern Character Weekly: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_gb2312, stkaiti;&quot;>; The strong men&#39;s weak comments on this season, this is your intention Is it for it? &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; Liu Le: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span>; It is not intentional. Usually, we do not save materials for the same nature. It is found that we can get out of this thing during the process of savoryness. Like the first issue of &quot;Looks Beautiful&quot;, it is the commonality we have come out. The three pairs are separated before the separation. In the separate material of everyone, we have taken this point that our marriage is good for outsiders, but it is not actually the case. &lt;/SPAN>; &lt;/P>; &lt;p>; As for the female strong and weak, I think we just provide a discussion perspective. Maybe everyone will have such a summary. In fact, none of these three pairs are strong women, but also weak places, so we discussed what is strong and economic strength? If there is only this dimension, it can be regarded as three pairs of women and men. But what about the right to speak? What about the need for love? What is the sense of existence in marriage? What about freedom and comfort? Who is the superior in emotion? Back to these dimensions, they may not be strong. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; Southern Character Weekly: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_GB2312, stkaiti;&quot;>; You just said that this show is a platform to explore a platform, this is this is this is a platform. Is the original intention of the show? &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; Liu Le: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span>; Only in this direction. Every time we meet a pair of partners, he comes to our show, and his performance may be somewhat exceeded: too manipulation, too insecure, too patient, etc. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; All the parts that exceed the threshold, we all want everyone to realize that this is a bit beyond, we can come back, we strive to stand in a safer area. But sometimes, when some problems happen, I also hope that everyone should not feel how big it is. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Now npd &lt;spd style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_GB2312, stkaiti;&quot;>; (narcissistic personality disorder) &lt;/span>;, gas lamp &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: Kaita, Kaiti_GB2312, Stkaiti; &quot;>; (a psychological manipulation method) &lt;/span>;, edge personality and other nouns often appear. What is the definition of professional? Will there be an overkill part? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; I have been thinking about this problem since the second season. Once this person&#39;s behavior is beyond our daily cognition, can we conclude that he is a lunatic? Or once we give a person a judgment, is it unattainable all the words he said next? I don&#39;t think so. Teacher Guo &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_gb2312, stkaiti;&quot;>; (Guo Keyu) &lt;/span>; In the first season, &quot;people have too many noodles.&quot; I particularly agree with this sentence . People are all kinds of people with crazy, low, high -value, and low -value people. People themselves are complex and imperfect animals, but they ask for the love of being loved. Everyone is equal, and everyone is equal. This is why &quot;Goodbye Lover&quot; has not strictly distinguished stars or amateur. We all put them in one field for discussion. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; I have read a comment that &quot;Goodbye Lover&quot; is like Jielu Ban lock, making the deduction tighter enough, so that the endangered scattered frame is smooth, rather than violent disassembly or never puzzled Open, we all find a final ending for all the crumbling Luban locks. I agree. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>; When talking about intimacy is no longer ashamed &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; Southern Character Weekly: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_gb2312, stkaiti;&quot; &quot;&quot; &quot; >; Why did you think of doing such a show at that time? &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; Liu Le: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span>; From the industry, the divorce track was a vacancy, and the major platforms were exploring the divorce IP. Some problems at home and abroad have not been solved. For example, what is the appeal? If you have divorced and put you on a travel together, do you have a demand? Or is this a show&#39;s demand? Is it a demand for watching? If the characters have no demands, the things presented may be very empty and float. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Divorce cooling period is the key to I think of this IP, it can be used as a appeal. The earliest locking was a couple who had entered the calm period. In only 30 days, we have to go to see this list. In marriage, everyone may have thought about divorce countless times. Why do you think? What do you put into time after thinking? Go to repair, or ignore it? ... There are a lot of characters in it to be described, and because the divorce action has not been really completed, we still have room for discussion. The guests in the third season should be said to be the earliest solution that fits my earliest, and it has not been finished. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; The first two seasons were also based on such an idea. The people we chose at least did not be cold in our judgment, and there was no story to tell. The divorce is too long. It is best to be less than two or three years. From time to time, these two people have some exchanges, and some people have even proposed composite and so on. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; In daily life, it is very clear to see other people&#39;s affairs. It can always be dragged when you look at your own things. Maybe it&#39;s better. Without a huge incident, it is not easy for people to start a knife in a relatively smooth and ups and downs. Everyone is not conscious of deep cracks. How can there be power to perceive this and who would have an X -ray of their emotions? Many people are either out of fear or laziness and escape. It&#39;s almost okay. What do you always say? In particular, this is more common in the relationship. What can be discussed? I want to go out to drink. I have a lot of colleagues, and the company is so many things. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Communication and communication many times is a matter of two people, not a unilateral choice. If I tell others, I want to talk to my lover about the problems in our marriage in the past eight years, but He doesn&#39;t talk to me well, so I want to divorce him, others may say that you are sick. But in the field of &quot;Goodbye Lover&quot;, no matter how small the problem is, you will be valued, and everyone will come to discuss. Then how do you talk about this, should you get a marriage? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;Goodbye Lover&quot; focused on many of the problems in the close relationship. I made this place with a large mirror. Everyone said that your problem seems to be worthy of attention. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; This is at least for those who are trapped in marriage, those who want to marry, and those who want to talk about these are embarrassed. I am no longer ashamed. I want to talk to you today. Chat, we communicate with me. I don&#39;t think this is very abrupt, I don&#39;t feel ashamed. This is healthy. This is also a courage and a kind of courage. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; Southern Character Weekly: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_gb2312, stkaiti;&quot; Relative place? &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; Liu Le: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span>; Selecting these places on the one hand is good -looking. The primitive and natural beauty is very important. When people can&#39;t figure it out, they should contact nature, but few people do this. The place where we choose is to stay for a long time, making them very difficult, and to the extreme, it feels that the heavens and the earth and the small people are small, which is an intuitive psychological suggestion. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Naturally, it still has a strong healing effect. We strive to create a high -purity (shooting) environment, so that they can rest assured that they can enter the deep -water area for discussion. This process is not easy. Beauty is a short -lived comfort. In any case, they are a very, very brave group. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;img src = &quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/g88g4zhwnzmhkogpkjaoqbygcr9cwpo.jpg&quot; border = &quot;0&quot; width = &quot;960&quot; height = &quot;640&quot; data-src = &quot;// Images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/g88g4zhwnzmhkogmanjggwkjaoqbygcr9cwpo.jpg&quot; data-key = &quot;260017&quot;>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p style = &quot;color : #999; Text-Align: Center; &quot;>;&quot; Goodbye Lover &quot;Season 2 &lt;span style =&quot; color: #aaa; &quot;>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>; Charming of love, praising romance &lt;/h4 &lt;/h4 &lt;/h4 &lt;/h4 &lt;/h4 >; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; Southern Character Weekly: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_gb2312, stkaiti;&quot;>; You have no marriage experience, the sweetness and pain of marriage in daily life are very fine. Really, how do you grasp these faint places in a divorce show? &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; Liu Le: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span>; I have to understand why he had to do such a thing at this moment. Why did he feel this? Why do you make such a judgment? It must not be 100 % common, but in this process, what is worth raising? These can be trained through training, that is, intuition of questions. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; I think it&#39;s good to have not married. I have been in contact with some peers. I heard that I want to do this subject. I especially want to talk to me. I think everyone is too focused on themselves. It is easy to conclude, &quot;What is marriage?&quot; During that time, there were a lot of hearing, which was very different. The only commonality was that they all believed in their judgment in marriage. At this time, I was empty. I do n’t listen to anyone. I only use your words as a sample. The samples can have many kernels for the audience to summarize themselves. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; If I already have a marriage, I dare not guarantee that I will say that this does not exist, because I did not encounter this situation in my marriage. This is too ridiculous and cut him. It is very dangerous without open thinking. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Love must be different. When I do a show, I will go back to my past relationship and realize that I have made such a mistake. This is a very interesting thing. Seeing others see very clearly. When it comes to yourself, who is a perfect partner? So on the other hand, I think love is a long -term homework. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; I look forward to my emotional concept from real feelings, not from the show. I hope &quot;Goodbye Lover&quot; is an auxiliary material. It should not be the main course. You have to feel the real people, not some truth. Fu Shouer has already made a lot of reason, and Wang and sleep are very reasonable, but why are they still not so happy? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; Southern Character Weekly: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_GB2312, stkaiti;&quot;>; The program has advanced to the present, the audience also felt a lot of laughter part of the laughter . But laughter cannot offset the substantial pain in marriage. What do you think of &quot;laugh&quot;? &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; Liu Le: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span>; Pain is pain. If the pain is down, laugh just to slide up. It may increase a bit of resistance to pain, or make people look down on the whole picture of pain more clearly. It is very artistic to deal with the pain. It is said that people come out of sadness from sadness, which is an artist. This smile is a kind of generous. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;img src = &quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/fmmseze0ondlhxs62rj0tim23umaiu2jpg&quot; border = &quot; 0 &quot;width =&quot; 960 &quot;height =&quot; 872 &quot;data-src =&quot; // Images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/11/29/fmmseze0ondlhxs62RJ0TIM23umai2JPG &quot;Data-key = &quot;260019&quot;>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p STYLE = &quot;COLOR: #999; Text-Align: Center;&quot;>; The first season of &quot;Goodbye Love&quot; &lt;span style = &quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>; &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;strong>; Southern Character Weekly: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span style = &quot;font-family: regular body, regular body_gb2312, stkaiti;&quot;>; How did you think of it? &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &lt;strong>; Liu Le: &lt;/strong>; &lt;span>; I felt that young people were too easy to give up. I used to like to persuade others to be sober, but when more and more people are saying that they want to be sober, give up, this is no big deal, I realize that this may be a new trend. When we are discussing, we are discussing Said to pull these people who want to break up. Is the behavior of &quot;Come and talk about&quot; itself is a bit old, and is it a bit in line with the current status quo of young people &quot;I will always find new people&quot;? That&#39;s why we say that goodbye is easy or difficult. Thinking of &quot;goodbye&quot; and &quot;goodbye&quot;, English is &quot;See You&quot; and &quot;See You Again&quot;. &lt;/span>; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; Modern people are too easy to see the flaws of others. There is no way to enter the deep water area and always switch in the shallow water area. When I was in love for several years, it seemed like the nourishment of people at that time. Now short videos are teaching you, &quot;I have to be vigilant if he do this&quot;, &quot;He doesn&#39;t say that he doesn&#39;t love you&quot; ... This disassembly is very rude. There are still many irritating parts in feelings. If everyone is influenced by these rough logic, I feel that we are all playing on the water. This is a pity. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; You can get a lot of happiness when you don&#39;t need to fall in love, and you have to fall in love. This is an extremely romantic thing. I hope I can praise (this kind of love and romance). In the past, people may have many needs for reality. I need a person to face life with me.

From 2020 to 2024, the number of recruitments of the national examinations was about 24,100, 25,700, 312,000, 37,100, and 39,600, which rose steadily, but far from meeting everyone&#39;s application needs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;相形之下，今年是八年来考研人数首度下降，或显示大家的考研热度已完成筑顶。 This shows that the trend of entrance examination and postgraduate entrance examination partnery or probability event. Because for most people, the postgraduate entrance examination is to delay employment and push the employment choice for two or three years, with a view to the graduate degree to make themselves have a certain competitive advantage, but on the one hand, the employment situation is becoming more and more difficult.两三年后的研究生，后者在求职上未必有显著优势，另一方面获取研究生学历的机会成本越来越高，学硕改专硕意味着更高的学费开支。考公就不一样了，把用来考研、读研的时间与金钱用来考公，一年可以考多个地方，直到考上为止，“上岸”的概率会更高。两者此消彼长，显然是越来越多的人认为直接考公性价比更高。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当然，考研与考公之间的关系是复杂的，除了有替代关系，还有互补关系。例如有一些人考研、读研之后，仍是为了考公，这是因为研究生学历能报考的公务员岗位更多，或者本科是双非，想要通过读985甚至更好学校的研究生，让自己的学历变得更高更有吸引力，额外还有一条选调生的从政通道，总之可以扩大自己的考公选择面。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;从国考岗位的招录要求看，学历的门槛有不断抬高的趋势。今年国考招录要求全部为大专及以上学历。在招录人数连年增加之下，要求大专学历为起点的岗位逐年减少，今年大专生可以报考的岗位有56个，同比减少106个。同时，要求硕博学历的岗位数量和计划人数大幅度增加。据中国青年报统计，今年要求硕士研究生及以上学历的岗位达2046个，同比增加814个；要求博士学历的岗位为24个，同比增加14个。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;如何解释这一现象？一种常见的看法是，机关单位对高学历人才的需求增加了。这其实等于没有解释。难道这些岗位真的只有硕士学历及以上才能干得了吗？恐怕也未必。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在当前的就业环境下，体制内岗位的吸引力进一步增强：有“编制”、薪水体面、福利完备、社会地位高、工作稳定，只要不犯大的原则性错误无失业之虞。因此对这些岗位的竞争也会不断加剧。国考录取/参加考试人数比，去年为1∶38，今年为1∶57，热门岗位比例更夸张。当竞争加剧，筛选人才的一个主要抓手就自然可以是学历了。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;对体制内用人单位来说，同样招一个人，为什么不选学历更高、学校更好的？基于纯客观指标，这样相当于用同样的编制与成本得到了“更优秀的人才”，领导与公众都挑不出毛病。反而，要是放着学历更高、学校更好的人不招，招了学历与学校一般的，大概率需要向公众解释，为什么不是“萝卜招聘”，所招的人是最适合这个岗位的。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;放在这种逻辑与心态之下，不难理解下述被公众热议的现象：北大核物理博士获得城管编制，上海交大医学博士成为中学校医，哈佛大学硕士应聘教育部留学服务中心非事业编岗位。也不难理解体制内招录学历门槛为何会不断抬高：去年要求本科，结果招到了几个名校硕士；今年干脆全部要求硕士，人家愿意来，又不用多费钱，何乐不为？ &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;确实，这和自由竞争行业的招聘逻辑很不一样。除非某些头部企业的研发部门，一般企业招人学历只是参考，关键看个人能力与品性同企业岗位需求是否匹配。学历过高，反而有over-qualification（资历过高）的问题。同样一个岗位，本科生可能比硕博干得更好，因为在企业看来，反正谁来都要接受职业培训，年轻是优势，头脑还没有僵化，敢于尝试与接受新鲜事物，上手快。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;不久前，有本科生吐槽，说以本科生身份求职得不到offer（邀约），伪装成高中生反而得到了很多offer。要高中生，不要“高材生”，是因为在企业看来，这份工作高中生足以完成，只要规规矩矩、老老实实按规程操作、听指令就行了，希望员工定下心来，保持工作稳定；如果找本科生，人家可能觉得自己大材小用，只是暂时将就，或会骑驴找马，不安心工作，何苦慕虚名而自找麻烦？一段时候后“高材生”走了，还得重新招人。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;总之，理解了体制内与自由竞争行业招人逻辑与心态的不同，学子们就可以决定到底需不需要读研，是本科就考公争取上岸还是读研让自己有更大的选择面。这些都是事实判断，而非价值判断。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;当然，从长远看，鼓励最优秀的学子去从事创新、去自由竞争行业创造财富，并为之创造良好的制度环境和动力机制，这自然是社会之福、国家之blessing.一段时间以来，为激励民营经济发展，政府出台了诸多措施，最近就有八部门出台“支持民营经济25条具体举措”，这用力方向是对的。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 29 Nov 2023 15:25:03 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
