These funds have played a positive role in promoting local construction. However, during an interview in Changyuan City, Henan Province not long ago, the reporter learned that some local affordable housing supporting projects invested by the central government have become decorations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the contents of the &quot;2016 Central Budgetary Investment Plan for the Construction of Supporting Infrastructure for Indemnified Housing Projects in Henan Province&quot;, the projects included in Changyuan, Henan Province at that time included the Puguang community resettlement housing supporting project and the food company The three projects, including the resettlement housing supporting infrastructure project and the Weizhuang shantytown renovation project in Changyuan County, involve a total of more than 40 million yuan in central budget funds. Seven years have passed. How are these projects being implemented? Have they achieved the expected results? The reporter investigated these three projects. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/2c5c8dbf497985a7c577e0e7238c94c5.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;1920&quot; height=&quot;1080&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/2c5c8dbf497985a7c577e0e7238c94c5.png&quot; data-key=&quot;250499&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;We first came to Hepingli Community in Changyuan, where the supporting project of resettlement housing for food companies in the plan was implemented. According to the plan, three three-dimensional garages were built here using central funds as supporting facilities for the community. However, residents reported that the three-dimensional garage was indeed built, but it was not used at all. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/80800df64ecbf4c08126c36f5543cf27.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;1920&quot; height=&quot;1080&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/80800df64ecbf4c08126c36f5543cf27.png&quot; data-key=&quot;250497&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;When I walked into this garage, it was full of dust and flying catkins, and there were no signs of a car parked on the ground. Some places have been damaged, and the circuits have not even been officially connected, and some corners have even become places where garbage is piled. The three-dimensional garage is a mechanical equipment system that can store and store a large number of vehicles, which can solve the problem of insufficient parking spaces on the ground. The built three-dimensional garage is idle and abandoned. What is the reason behind this? The reporter found the property owner of the community to learn about the situation. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Liang Caiyun, manager of the Hepingli Community Property Company in Changyuan City, Henan Province:&lt;/strong>;“So far, the technical management rights have not been transferred to us.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt; img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/a5653e7091b5089187f435a828f6dc81.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1920&quot; height= &quot;1080&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/a5653e7091b5089187f435a828f6dc81.png&quot; data-key=&quot;250501&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;This three-dimensional garage Who actually built it? After it is completed, why not hand it over to the property for use? The property manager said that these garages were applied for construction by the developers of the converted shed community. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/495785deec4c3387618896218e02e6b3.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;1920&quot; height=&quot;1080&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/495785deec4c3387618896218e02e6b3.png&quot; data-key=&quot;250496&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Changyuan&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Aoqi&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Head of Real Estate Development Company&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Fu Caiting&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;:&lt; /strong>;“Because there are not enough ground parking spaces, since there are government support policies, I applied for three-dimensional parking spaces.”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The government support policy the person in charge mentioned is the central government’s special funds. The application materials at that time showed that in 2016, this community, which is the three-dimensional garage project of the food company&#39;s shantytown reconstruction and resettlement housing, and the property and sanitary housing were included in the central budget investment of Henan Province&#39;s affordable housing infrastructure, with an estimated investment of 5.42 million. Yuan. Why do good things come to an end? We found the construction company of the three-dimensional garage to learn about the situation. The person in charge of this company said that most of these three-dimensional garages are not easy to use in actual use. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/e72fa1c5560d65de11ba00bb418e132c.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;1920&quot; height=&quot;1080&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/e72fa1c5560d65de11ba00bb418e132c.png&quot; data-key=&quot;250489&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Zhongyuan&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Aoqi&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Fu Sen, the person in charge of Industrial Co., Ltd.:&lt;/strong>;“It is special equipment and needs to be inspected every two years. Like an elevator, you need to sign up for a professional maintenance team every year. A parking space costs more than 100 yuan. If you keep investing in it, the owner will not spend money to buy this thing.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It seems that when this type of product is actually used, Parking is difficult, has many restrictions, and incurs relatively high operating expenses. Market acceptance is very low, and garage manufacturers are obviously well aware of this. Is this situation clear to the city&#39;s Shanty Town Renovation Office, which is responsible for implementing this project? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/20359fe454dfac9ffdfcf811afdaed52.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;1920&quot; height=&quot;1080&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/20359fe454dfac9ffdfcf811afdaed52.png&quot; data-key=&quot;250491&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;With the funds, three six-story three-dimensional garages with a capacity of 123 parking spaces were quickly built. The person in charge of the company undertaking the construction of the garage said that it is most appropriate to use special government funds to build a three-dimensional garage. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/47aa3363e5e4ee66f308c75fec70618a.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;1920&quot; height=&quot;1080&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/47aa3363e5e4ee66f308c75fec70618a.png&quot; data-key=&quot;250488&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Dong Peng, Director of the Shantytown Reconstruction Office of Changyuan City, Henan Province:&lt;/strong>; “If the garage is implemented, it will be beneficial to the people, the government, and individuals. The result will be beneficial to the people. They did not do it well, but they themselves benefited.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;There is no doubt that Aoqi Industrial, the company that built the garage, became the biggest beneficiary of this project. According to the winning bid documents at the time, they won the bid at a price of 4.61 million yuan to build 123 parking spaces, with an average price of nearly 40,000 yuan per parking space. The reporter learned during the interview with Aoqi Industrial that even now, the market price they offer is only about 20,000 yuan per parking space. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/a67f6eb37c23d88650bbcbd43ed3fb8c.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;1920&quot; height=&quot;1080&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/a67f6eb37c23d88650bbcbd43ed3fb8c.png&quot; data-key=&quot;250492&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;The market price is about 20,000 yuan. When the project in this community was implemented, the company won the bid at a price of nearly 40,000 yuan. The profit margin is really not small. Even so, why is the garage still not put into use normally? The reporter&#39;s investigation revealed that the reason behind this is not unrelated to the poor project management of the relevant departments. According to the bidding plan issued by the Changyuan City Shantytown Renovation Office at the time, the bidding content not only included the construction of the three-dimensional garage, but also clearly included &quot;the training, trial operation and delivery of installation and commissioning personnel.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cms-emer-res.cctvnews.cctv.com/image/3003/upload/15a347e52fa44d4aabaac9abe3a47192.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 0.5; &quot; width=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;0&quot; data-src=&quot;https://cms-emer-res.cctvnews.cctv.com/image/3003/upload/15a347e52fa44d4aabaac9abe3a47192.png&quot; data-key=&quot;media-1694567076243 -8&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Not only have they not been put into use, in fact, these three garages have not even been completed at the most basic level. The construction of these three garages with a total of 123 parking spaces was completed at the end of 2017. However, in June 2018, the garage builder received a demolition decision from the local planning bureau, requiring them to demolish one of them within 15 days. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Deputy Director of the Natural Resources and Planning Bureau of Changyuan City, Henan Province&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Mao Yongxia&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;:&lt;/strong>; “Residents also reported it, saying that it affected the lighting , so he issued a demolition penalty decision, but the 15 days were not up, so he demolished it on his own.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the garage was demolished, the company did not find a place to rebuild it, but piled a pile of waste materials in the community. . However, this does not affect the relevant departments from allocating the remaining nearly one million yuan of project funds to the company in 2019. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/9c6f911d1293bab50ccd767bf8547d2d.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;1920&quot; height=&quot;1080&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/9c6f911d1293bab50ccd767bf8547d2d.png&quot; data-key=&quot;250490&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;The number of parking spaces is insufficient and has not been delivered for use, but the company has received all 4.66 million yuan in financial funds. In this way, no one will take care of the later trial operation, delivery operation and other issues. The problem of difficult parking in the community has not yet been solved. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The first project on the schedule ended up running out of money and the garage became a decoration. What about the next project on the schedule? Let’s take a look at the Puguang community resettlement housing supporting project. The local government submitted an application to build a kindergarten, a clinic and other related facilities, and the central government allocated a total of more than 18 million yuan. However, the reporter walked around the community twice and found no newly built kindergarten. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/b46d588ea3a34e7f7dda17777fc3f608.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;1920&quot; height=&quot;1080&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/b46d588ea3a34e7f7dda17777fc3f608.png&quot; data-key=&quot;250494&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Song Guangjun, deputy general manager of Henan Great Wall Construction Company:&lt;/strong>; &quot;Originally, I applied for a location in the south district of the community, but that location in the south district was unrealistic. It turned out that the consideration was very good, but the planning could not be coordinated and adjusted, so I said no Get it. After the two areas are planned, we can&#39;t say that a building will pop up. It certainly can&#39;t be like this, so the application plan was well imagined at that time, but it couldn&#39;t be realized in the end.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https: //images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/6d7a56d16158deb86ed87290f37f585c.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1280&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; data-src =&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/6d7a56d16158deb86ed87290f37f585c.png&quot; data-key=&quot;250493&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The kindergarten is said to have no space to build, and the sanitation Where is the room? There is a row of commercial front rooms at the entrance of Puguang Community. The developer said that two of the front rooms are health rooms. According to the bid-winning documents for the supporting projects in Puguang Community at that time, Great Wall Construction Company won the bid for this project in December 2016, and the completion date of the building where the clinic is located was also December 2016, which means that this project is recruiting When the bidding process was held, the entire building was already completed, so how could there be any talk of a new health room? &lt;p>; &quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/1f9dc021ec5ddc8fa6813f3e582b68ed.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1920&quot; height=&quot;1080&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/1f9dc021ec5ddc8fa6813f3e582b68ed.png&quot; data-key=&quot;250500&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is said to take practical use into consideration , In fact, this so-called health room has not been put into use yet. Dedicated funds are the basic requirement for special fiscal funds in our country. Where did the 18 million yuan of central fiscal funds invested in this project go? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The local government applied for 18 million yuan in central funds for this project in Puguang Community, but only 6 million yuan was actually allocated. It is unknown where the remaining funds were used. According to my country&#39;s &quot;Measures for the Administration of Direct Investment Projects within the Central Budget&quot;, any adjustment of construction standards or investment scale, change of construction location or construction content without approval; transfer, embezzlement or misappropriation of construction funds are all violations. Regarding this phenomenon, how does the local municipal development and reform department responsible for project supervision view this phenomenon? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/a86d3ccb95a64992f60469d79881f8ea.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;1920&quot; height=&quot;1080&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/a86d3ccb95a64992f60469d79881f8ea.png&quot; data-key=&quot;250495&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Chen Feng, Chief of the Urban Development Section of the Development and Reform Commission of Henan Changyuan City:&lt;/strong>;“Our management of it starts from project establishment and ends with project completion.

What is going on? According to the plan, a road of about 560 meters will be built locally to connect two municipal roads from Weiba Road to Weishi Road. The central government has allocated a total of 17 million yuan in funds, and it is scheduled to be completed in 2017. However, when we came here to learn about the situation, we found that six years later, this road is still a dead end, with more than 200 meters still not repaired. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;strong>;Chen Feng, Chief of the Urban Development Section of the Development and Reform Commission of Henan Changyuan City:&lt;/strong>;“It is understood that one section has not been completely completed due to demolition issues, and some parts may have stalled.”&lt;/p>; p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/e6c8e1628a1be5e2666d783a8c864202.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width =&quot;1920&quot; height=&quot;1080&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/e6c8e1628a1be5e2666d783a8c864202.png&quot; data-key=&quot;250502&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In order to build this road, 17 million yuan of funds from the central government has been allocated long ago, but the road has not been completed. At the construction company of this road, the reporter learned that they actually only received more than 6 million yuan in funding. In accordance with the requirements of relevant documents, local development and reform departments and housing construction departments should take measures to strengthen dynamic supervision of project construction implementation, and projects that cannot be completed on time or fail to pass completion acceptance will be criticized through notices, withdrawn or deducted from the central budget Domestic investment and other measures shall be punished. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the reporter&#39;s interview, the local government rectified these problematic projects, and now garages, health rooms, etc. are gradually being put into use. Central fiscal funds are invested in local people&#39;s livelihood projects. In order for central fiscal funds to be used wisely and truly promote development, benefit the people, and benefit the country, it is necessary to strengthen effective supervision of fund implementation and project implementation. If you treat the funds from the central government as Tang Monk Meat and only apply for them, regardless of project implementation and actual results, how can such a &quot;popular support project&quot; win the support of the people? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 13 Sep 2023 20:25:04 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[揭示问题与整改同样重要：28省份审计报告中的财政难题]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256582]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-13 19:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/13/NRuXpg0MK228rq9kxE3yCvLnZ6lFqDOZg1MIH8Zb.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1700&quot; height=&quot;1133&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/NRuXpg0MK228rq9kxE3yCv LnZ6lFqDOZg1MIH8Zb. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250512&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>; (Visual China/Picture) &lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Compulsory education funds were misappropriated 265 million yuan (Inner Mongolia), city commercial banks illegally lent 40.6 billion yuan (Hebei), two counties charged 251 million yuan without basis (Sichuan), and 6 companies were dishonest Enterprises received financial subsidies (Chongqing), and 10 cities and counties owed private enterprises 400 million yuan in accounts (Jilin)...&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since July 2023, 28 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities across the country have successively announced their own The 2022 annual audit report focuses on local budget implementation and other fiscal revenue and expenditures, revealing a variety of problems.

Looking at the audit reports that have been published in various places, 4.491 billion is the highest misappropriation amount. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The misappropriation of funds includes the misappropriation of compulsory education funds. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Relevant agencies in Inner Mongolia audited 469 urban schools and 184 rural schools and found that 21 banner counties misappropriated 265 million yuan of compulsory education funds to make up for the funding gap in other projects; 42 banner counties 991 million yuan Funds for compulsory education are stagnant, resulting in projects such as improving school conditions being unable to be implemented or completed on schedule. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Insufficient funds will cause other problems. &quot;41 banner counties have borrowed 923 teachers on a long-term basis, and 74 primary and secondary schools in 16 banner counties have insufficient staff, and long-term temporary employment of substitute teachers.&quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Chongqing, which is more than a thousand kilometers away from Inner Mongolia, is facing Faced with the same problem, &quot;177 schools in 8 districts and counties illegally used 33.0776 million yuan per student in public funds, training funds, etc. for daily operations and other expenses.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The State Council’s audit report also disclosed the misappropriation of education funds: After an audit of urban and rural compulsory education subsidy funds, it was found that 16 provinces had misappropriated 2.524 billion yuan to balance budgets, repay debts, and issue benefits. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Based on the audit reports of various provinces, the main flow of misappropriated funds is daily expenses or filling a certain funding gap. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“19 units occupied 9.7214 million yuan in employment subsidy funds to make up for the lack of unit administrative funds and office building maintenance and other expenses.” The Hubei audit report stated. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many places also use false expenditures to obtain funds. The audit reports of 8 provinces mentioned &quot;false expenditures&quot;, with the largest amount involved being in Sichuan, with 4.832 billion yuan of fictitious expenditures in 4 cities and counties. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Two departments and three affiliated units falsely listed electricity expenses of 1.6293 million yuan.&quot; Heilongjiang audit report introduced. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The audit report of the State Council mentioned that 2 departments and 8 affiliated units obtained 80.7967 million yuan of funds through false expenditures and other methods, of which 4.7185 million yuan was used for food, drink, gifts, etc., or was misappropriated by individuals. . This reflects on one side that behind the false expenditures, there may be corruption issues. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Budget Law of the People&#39;s Republic of China&quot; issued in 2019 stipulates that governments at all levels and relevant departments and units shall be ordered to report any failure to include all government revenues and expenditures in the budget, or to falsely list revenues and expenditures. To make corrections, the directly responsible person in charge and other directly responsible personnel will be punished by demotion, dismissal, or expulsion in accordance with the law. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Hundreds of billions of temporary payments to be solved&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Among the problems found in the provincial audit reports, most of the problems involving the highest amounts are financial temporary payments. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporters found that the issue of temporary payments was mentioned in the audit reports of six provinces including Inner Mongolia and Hebei. Among them, the temporary payment balance in 5 provinces exceeds 10 billion. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Financial temporary payments are generally funds temporarily lent by the financial department to budget units. It is required that they should not be left on the books for a long time and should be cleared and settled in a timely manner. The Ministry of Finance stipulates that all localities must digest the fiscal temporary payments formed in 2018 and before by the end of 2023. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The State Council audit report shows that as of the end of 2022, the balance of temporary fiscal payments in 54 regions reached 148.139 billion yuan, an increase of 8.363 billion yuan over the previous year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Inner Mongolia audit report stated, “The balance of temporary payments in 4 cities reached 47.055 billion yuan at the end of 2021, and the progress of digesting the stock is slow. 2 cities at the same level and 8 banner counties (districts) have not completed the digestion progress. Task&quot;. Among the six provinces that have announced temporary payment issues, Inner Mongolia has the highest temporary payment balance. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Ministry of Finance stipulates that the newly formed fiscal temporary payment balance after 2019 shall not exceed 5% of the sum of general public budget expenditures and government fund budget expenditures at the same level. Audit reports from Guangxi, Gansu, Inner Mongolia, and Hebei all revealed that some counties and cities failed to meet this requirement. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Guangxi audit report shows that as of the end of 2022, the cumulative balance of fiscal temporary payments newly formed after 2019 has exceeded the 5% control line in 10 cities and 54 counties. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Moreover, the provisional payments in Hubei and Guangxi have not decreased but increased. &quot;As of the end of 2022, the balance of temporary payments in 20 cities and counties reached 26.055 billion yuan, an increase of 1.386 billion yuan over the previous year.&quot; The Hubei audit report revealed that some were used for unbudgeted and over-budget expenditures. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the end of 2018, the Ministry of Finance issued the &quot;Notice on Strictly Regulating the Management of Temporary Payments of Local Finances&quot;, requiring the financial department not to lend to enterprises, nor to lend to enterprises through other budget units. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, illegal lending to enterprises still exists today. The Inner Mongolia audit report stated that “one city level and three banner districts illegally lent 4.585 billion yuan to enterprises.” The Hebei audit report also showed that four cities illegally lent 1.068 billion yuan to enterprises. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Excessive temporary payment balances will crowd out other funds for special purposes and normal treasury funds, creating a situation where &quot;the budget has targets, but the treasury has no cash.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“The gap between local revenue and expenditure is widening, and it is difficult to get back the money borrowed.” A financial bureau official in a coastal province told Southern Weekend reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;2022 Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region Final Accounts Report at the Level&quot; released in July 2023 stated that it is necessary to establish a classified management mechanism for temporary payments, steadily digest the stock, strictly control the increment, and promote the maintenance of temporary payments at the grassroots level. Reasonable scale, gradually replenishing the occupied treasury funds, and ensuring within-budget expenditure needs. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Tens of billions of special bonds are idle&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;As an important means for the government to stimulate consumption and expand domestic demand, special bonds have become the focus of audit reports in various places . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;19 of the 28 provincial audit reports mentioned problems with special debt. Among them, 12 reports stated that special bonds were idle. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Local government special bonds, also known as &quot;special bonds&quot;, refer to bonds issued by provincial governments for public welfare projects with certain returns. For a long time, it has mainly invested in social basic investment fields. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;If it is a general bond, it is mainly invested in non-profit public welfare projects, and the source of principal and interest repayment is general public budget revenue. In contrast, the repayment funds for special bonds are government fund income, special income and refinancing special bond funds, which are required to achieve a balance between project revenue and expenditure. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Audit reports in some regions revealed that some special bond funds have been idle for as long as a year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Jiangsu audit report stated that the audit agency randomly inspected 62 cities and counties and found that as of the end of 2022, the government special bond funds for 337 projects in 54 cities and counties had not been fully put into use, with a balance of 22.944 billion yuan. Among them, 9.123 billion yuan has a balance of more than one year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Provincial-level bond funds are 1.954 billion yuan, which have been idle for up to 247 days; 29 cities and counties including Nanyang have bond funds of 6.637 billion yuan, which have been idle for up to 300 days.&quot; Henan audit report revealed . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After the special bonds are idle, in addition to the original investment goals being unable to be achieved, the local government also needs to pay interest on the funds. If the special debt remains on the books for one more day, it will incur a lot of additional costs. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to data from the Ministry of Finance, the average interest rate of special bonds is slightly higher than that of general bonds. As of the end of July 2023, the average interest rate on local government bonds was 3.33%. Among them, general bonds 3.31% and special bonds 3.34%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Taking the Jiangsu audit report as an example, the special debt funds outstanding for more than one year are 9.123 billion yuan. Calculated based on the average interest rate of special bonds of 3.34%, approximately 305 million yuan in interest will be paid per year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What causes tens of billions of special bonds to remain idle? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Based on the audit reports from various places, it is mainly due to problems in the preliminary preparation stage. For example, Jilin admitted in its audit report that due to failure to obtain construction land procedures and other reasons, project preparations were insufficient and it was difficult to start construction on time. 22 projects in 7 cities and counties had 5.993 billion yuan of idle funds. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Jiangsu audit report states that special bonds are idle because of &quot;immature conditions for construction projects, lagging implementation progress, or advanced bond funding arrangements, etc.&quot; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Wen Laicheng, a professor at the Central University of Finance and Economics, told Southern Weekend reporters that according to normal procedures, after the project completes all government approval procedures, it will then be reported to the provincial-level finance department to apply for the issuance of special bonds, and the funds will be available immediately. start. However, some local governments begin to declare special bonds when they go through the approval process, and the financial department sometimes agrees to issue them. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;He explained that special bonds are government investment projects, and more than 20 government departments are involved in the review and approval. If one department disagrees, the project cannot start construction. Even if the special bond funds are in place, there is no way to use them and it is easy to become idle. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;City commercial banks&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;, &lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;Rural Credit Cooperatives lending illegally&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In addition to paying close attention to issues in the financial field , the audit report also focuses on the chaos in the financial system. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Eight provincial audit reports mentioned that many city commercial banks and rural credit cooperatives have loopholes in risk management and compliance, compliance operations and other sectors. Among them, the largest amount involved was illegal lending. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the past few years, the competent authorities have been tightening the space for regional commercial banks to lend in other places. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The &quot;Commercial Bank Law of the People&#39;s Republic of China (Revised Draft)&quot; promulgated in 2020 requires that regional commercial banks such as urban commercial banks, rural commercial banks, village and town banks, etc., shall carry out banking operations in accordance with the law within the scope of their residence. Business activities shall not be carried out across regions without approval. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Hebei audit department found that eight city commercial banks issued loans in violation of regulations, including issuing loans to customers or related parties whose loans were overdue, and that different branches within a jurisdiction issued loans to the same borrower, violating regulations. The amount of loans involved is 40.6 billion yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Nine city commercial banks failed to strictly implement the &quot;three loan checks&quot; system, resulting in greater risks in 5.959 billion yuan of loan funds. &quot;Three Loan Inspections&quot; refers to pre-loan investigation, loan review, and post-loan inspection. This system enables banks to understand the operating conditions of borrowers, determine loan risks, and is also an important basis for subsequent accountability. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Jiangxi audit report disclosed that 32 rural commercial banks had lax &quot;three loan inspections&quot; and illegally granted loans of 2.502 billion yuan to borrowers who did not meet the conditions such as credit reporting. 29 rural commercial banks failed to effectively track and inspect the use of loan funds, and 4.79 billion yuan of credit funds were misappropriated. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to illegal lending, there are also problems in the risk management and control of many city commercial banks. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; According to the Jiangxi audit report, 28 rural commercial banks concealed loan risks by adjusting loan classification results in violation of regulations and repaying loans with loans, underreporting non-performing loans by 2.552 billion yuan; 8 rural commercial banks expanded credit in violation of regulations and passed We disposed of 1.854 billion yuan of non-performing assets by issuing loans to third parties to assume debts and transferring loans; 23 rural commercial banks wrote off non-performing loans worth 1.626 billion yuan in violation of regulations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Liaoning audit department focused on investigating the operations of two urban commercial banks and found that &quot;the president and vice president positions of one bank have been vacant for a long time, and some senior managers have not been approved by the regulatory authorities.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Inner Mongolia audit report revealed a detail that 6 leading cadres of a certain county health commission, public security bureau and other government departments and 12 other public officials illegally took shares in 2 rural commercial banks, involving 3.2036 million yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Do a good job in the &quot;second half of the article&quot; on audit rectification&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The first meeting of the 20th Central Audit Committee emphasized that the &quot;second half of the article&quot; on audit rectification &quot;The first half of the article&quot; is equally important as the problems revealed by the audit and must be promoted in one piece. Supervision and promotion of audit rectification should be regarded as an important starting point for daily supervision, and audit results should be used as an important reference for cadre assessment, appointment and dismissal, rewards and punishments. Those who fail to make rectifications, make perfunctory rectifications, or make false rectifications must be seriously held accountable. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In December 2022, the official website of the Guizhou Provincial Audit Office released the &quot;Report on the Rectification of Problems Found in the 2021 Provincial Budget Implementation and Other Financial Revenue and Expenditure Audits.&quot; According to the report, in response to the problem of misappropriation of 1.764 billion yuan of ecological and environmental protection funds in 1 city and 10 counties, the relevant regions have cleaned up the misappropriated resources and environment funds, and 475 million yuan has been rectified through the return of the original channels. The remaining funds are planned to be gradually Return in place. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the audit reports of 18 provinces in 2023, there are special chapters to introduce the transfer of clues about disciplinary and illegal violations, or the preliminary rectification of problems found in the audit. According to the official website of the local audit office (bureau), about one year after the audit report is released, a special report will be released to focus on the rectification of problems found in the audit report. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Hainan audit report stated that in 2022, the Provincial Audit Office transferred a total of 28 clues to disciplinary and illegal issues, involving 82 people and 440 million yuan. As of June 2023, 7 cases have been settled, 21 cases are being handled, and 12 people have been dealt with. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The transfer matters manifested themselves as illegal decision-making by public officials and abuse of power for personal gain, etc., resulting in the loss and waste of state-owned funds, state-owned assets and state-owned resources, involving 11 cases, 72 people, and 125 million yuan. In addition, the problems of &quot;mutual collusion&quot; and &quot;internal and external collusion&quot; in the field of engineering construction are hidden and diverse, mainly involving illegal project bidding, illegal subcontracting, and bid rigging, involving 5 cases involving 3 people and 278 million yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The contradiction between fiscal revenue and expenditure has increased, and how to make up for the misappropriated funds has become a difficult problem in the audit and rectification process. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;An official working in the Audit Office of a southern province told Southern Weekend reporters that after the local government’s misappropriation of funds was discovered by the audit department, due to rectification requirements, all funds needed to be replenished. However, due to financial constraints, In some places, other funds have been misappropriated to repay the misappropriated funds. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;In the past five years, more than 440,000 units across the country have been audited, and more than 38,000 clues on major issues have been transferred to disciplinary inspection and supervision, judicial and other departments, involving more than 920 billion yuan and more than 51,000 people; promoting revenue growth Saving expenditures and recovering losses of more than 2 trillion yuan.&quot; At the National Audit Work Conference in January 2023, Hou Kai, Auditor General of the National Audit Office, introduced. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;6月28日，对国务院审计报告的汇报中，侯凯说，截至2023年4月，对2021年度审计发现的问题，已整改问题金额8501.11亿元，完善制度2900多项，追责问责1.4万多人。 &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;他表示，重点督办的问题线索总体进展顺利，铲除了一些阻碍改革发展和长期未解决的顽瘴痼疾。 “审计整改总体格局初步成型，审计工作&#39;下半篇文章&#39;更加权威高效。”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>;

&lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;肇庆市高要二中小卖部，现由道诚百货经营，平均年租金十余万。&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（南方周末记者卫琳聪/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2023年9月9日，广西贺州市平桂区人民政府办公室发布一则通报，将对贺州第五高级中学小卖部经营权进行调查。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;此前，该校以224万元的价格，将校园小卖部2023年秋季学期至2024年春季学期的经营权承包给当地一家食品批发店，而这家店成立仅一个月，引发舆论关注。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这是半个月来因校园小卖部拍出高价第二次引发热议。8月22日，广东肇庆市怀集中学小卖部5年租金拍出943万余元，约合189万元/年。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“天价”小卖部也并非最近才有。早在2016年，广西南宁三中小卖部就因租金高达173万元/年被各大媒体报道。近两年，湖南邵阳等地也接连爆出年租金上百万的校园小卖部。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;南方周末记者调查发现，正是由于校园小卖部招标方式越来越公开透明，才令这门被人忽视的“大生意”受到前所未有的关注，而校内小卖部的稀缺性，是其拍出高价的根源。&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;“9&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;00&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;万元的大生意”&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;2023年9月1日，怀集中学刚刚开学，一排排新生正在操场上列队军训。这所2011年成立的公办学校有8300多名学生，涵盖初中和高中。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;学校对面遍布各类餐饮店和便利店，麻辣烫、螺蛳粉、奶茶、流动小吃摊等花花绿绿的招牌挂满了一条街。中午放学时间，校门打开，穿蓝白校服的学生蜂拥而出，整条街瞬间热闹起来。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;尽管刚开学，但学校小卖部租金拍出高价的消息已经在学生和商户间传开。这家150平方米的小卖部开在校园内，现在是学生口中“900万元的大生意”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;周边商户告诉南方周末记者，怀集中学对面近百平方米的店铺，每月租金在2000元左右。校内小卖部租金折合月算，比校外这些店铺高出六倍多。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;但对于校内这个租金水平，商户们并不感到惊讶。他们介绍，怀集中学实行半封闭式管理，不少学生住校，只有中午和下午几个小时外出时间，多数时候在校内消费，而校内只有一家小卖部。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“一个军训下来，一天不说多，光饮料就能卖五六百箱。”一位在校门口开奶茶店的老板说，他的小孩就在怀集中学读书，小卖部卖的商品价格要比校外贵5毛到1块。多位学生也向南方周末记者证实了这一点。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;张雪瑞和丈夫在肇庆经营一家食品行，给肇庆多所学校小卖部供货，已经做了十几年。她告诉南方周末记者，校外小卖部的毛利率一般为25%-30%，而校内小卖部可以达到40%，消费主力是住校生。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;她详细算了一笔账：怀集中学小卖部租金一年近两百万元，扣除人工、水电费等成本，小卖部每天营收3万左右才能保本。学校共有8300多名学生，如果有4000人住校，每人每天消费10元，单日营业额能达到4万元。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;这家小卖部位于怀集中学西门附近。9月1日开学这天，小卖部正忙着进货，成堆的货物从门口停放的货车里卸下。店里已经摆好了9个货架和两排冰柜，除了零食、饮料，还卖文具和生活用品。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;怀集中学小卖部的中标公告，并未显示中标人信息。但小卖部的价格标签上都写着“都市通便利店”。都市通便利店隶属于深圳市都市通实业有限公司（下称都市通）。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;企查查显示，都市通曾中标深‬圳‬市‬第‬三‬高‬级‬中‬学、布‬吉‬高‬级‬中‬学、深‬圳‬市‬龙‬岗‬区‬第‬二‬职‬业‬技‬术‬学‬校等多所学校的采购项目，为其供应方便面、饮料等食品和文具、生活用品。‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;南方周末记者联系了都市通，接电话的工作人员确认，公司承包了怀集中学小卖部。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/EieJcZzvpJjOUPFb7duNAApp0YiZ326pTKjdib5L.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;

text-align: center;&quot;>;校内小卖部的消费主力是住校生。&lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;（南方周末记者卫琳聪/图）&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;价高者得&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;被爆出高价租金的校园小卖部，多采取竞价方式招标，且价格上不封顶。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;怀集中学小卖部的招标公告和怀集县对此事的说明，均透露了当时竞争之激烈：34个人（含公司）进行了2274轮竞价，按照1000元的加价幅度，38万余元的挂牌价最后被抬高到超过943万，加价近24倍。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2021年5月10日，肇庆市高要区第二中学小卖部3年经营权以728万元成交，一年租金约243万元，比怀集中学小卖部还高。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;广东广播电视台的报道显示，该项目经过167次增价竞拍，最终由广东省成隆校园便利店连锁管理有限公司竞得，负责人姓许。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;许姓负责人在接受采访时表示，投标的时候没底，也不知道最终会去到那么高的价格。为了和对手竞争，他以3万元的加价幅度逐步抬高价格，“想着对方都能做，我们也能做，（最终成交价）只比对手多了3万元”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;凡是以竞价方式招租的小卖部，战况都很激烈。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;据《上游新闻》报道，2021年4月，湖南邵阳新宁县第二中学100平方米小卖部3年租金起拍价68万元，最终以320万元成交，约合107万元/年。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在一则背景为“新宁县第二中学小卖部门面经营权公开拍卖会”的视频中，竞拍者不断举牌加价，拍卖价格一路攀升。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;《法制晚报》报道，2016年广西南宁市第三中学172平方米小卖部年租金拍出173万元。一位参与竞拍的人士介绍，共8位竞价人参与竞争，使用电子竞拍器出价，以50万元底起拍，加价1次最低1万元，最终经过44轮竞价方才成交。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;不过，有些小卖部的高租金并不是一次性缴纳，大大降低了中标者的资金压力，也让投标者在竞标时可以大胆加价。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;如怀集中学小卖部承包合同中明确，租金按月计缴。5年930多万元的租金，每月缴纳约15.5万元。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;店内一位工作人员亦向南方周末记者表示，第一个月租金交了就可以开业。“十几二十万而已，你有钱也可以做这个生意。”&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;公开竞&lt;/strong>;&lt;strong>;价&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;实际上，近年来“天价”小卖部频频见诸报端，也和招投标流程逐步规范、公开有关。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;公立学校小卖部属于国有资产，租金收入应纳入政府非税收入管理。早在2004年，财政部就曾发布加强政府非税收入管理的通知，提出“要依法推行国有资源使用权招标、拍卖”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;此后各地开始逐步推进。高要区财政局一位工作人员向南方周末记者回忆，区里逐步规范小卖部招租是从2009年开始。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“2009年之后，校园小卖部招租要由财政局审批后进行招拍挂。此前只需学校向教育局报批，招拍挂流程也没有现在规范。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2016年南宁三中校办主任在接受《法制晚报》记者采访时表示，当时南宁市对校园进行规范化试点，将原本捆绑在一起的小卖部和食堂进行剥离，开始对小卖部公开招租。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;在全国公共资源交易平台上，能检索到的校园小卖部招标公告大多出现在2020年之后。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;肇庆第一条公告出现在2021年，招标人是高要二中。上述高要区财政局工作人员介绍，校园小卖部招标工作归属资产管理股负责，这个部门正是当时成立的。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;不经过公开竞价的小卖部，有时则存在一些问题。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;如福建厦门第十中学官网显示，2014年8月31日至2017年7月31日，学校食堂和小卖部实行捆绑承包经营，由学校组织相关人员组成评标小组进行综合评标，择优中标。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;公告中特别说明，教职工配偶可参与投标，以帮助其就业。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;而小卖部承包中不透明招租、教职工亲属参与等方式，曾屡屡引发校园腐败。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2021年广西横州市纪委监委网站披露的一则案例显示，横州市石塘镇一所小学的校长在2006年至2014年间，将学校小卖部以每年8000元的价格承包给其妻子经营，2014年后租金上调至1万元/年，由其妻子继续租到2020年，租金远低于同类小学小卖部。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2006年至2020年，该小学小卖部均未向社会公开招标，也没有报经主管部门审核同意、报财政部门审批。涉事校长被查后受到留党察看二年、降低岗位等级处分。&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;新的矛盾&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;然而，公开竞价在增强招标透明性的同时，也产生了新的问题。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;外界的担忧在于，中标商家可能会通过提高商品售价，将租金成本转嫁到学生身上。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2021年小卖部拍出3年320万租金后，邵阳新宁二中一直面对这样的质疑。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;一位曾负责此次招标的新宁县政府工作人员向南方周末记者透露，以往新宁县也采用公开竞标方式拍卖校园小卖部经营权，年租金大多二三十万元。2021年因为商家互相竞争，价格被炒得比较高，落选商家将此事爆料给媒体，进而引发了关注。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;随后新宁县叫停了此次招标，并对招标情况展开调查。调查结果并没有发现招标过程有违规之处，但政府担心商家在高租金压力下抬高商品价格，难以监管，最终决定关闭县里所有公立学校的校园小卖部。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“我们县主要是不能解决这个矛盾。如果以招拍挂把小卖部承包出去，（商家）利润和学生消费（权益）存在矛盾。如果不承包出去，学校不是商业机构，不能作为法人自己经营。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;同样因“天价”小卖部引发舆论关注的南宁三中，作出了同样的选择。一位总务处的工作人员告诉南方周末记者，学校已经好几年没有开设小卖部了。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;以728万拍得高要二中小卖部3年经营权后，承包商在实际经营过程中出现问题。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;据广东电视台《今日一线》栏目报道，该承包商经营不到半年就关门歇业。校方负责人接受采访时称，承包商2021年9月份向学校及教育局提出关门请求，表示经营亏损，无法持续。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;高要二中在小卖部租赁合同中明确要求，“小卖部经营的所有商品必须明码标价，商品价格不得高于市场价格”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;张雪瑞曾给该承包商供货，她告诉南方周末记者，截至关门歇业，对方还欠她16万元货款未付。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;张雪瑞展示了2021年丈夫对该承包商的微信催款记录，对方表示：“二中做三个多月，保证金24万亏掉，租金连装修，要亏掉六七十万，这六七十万欠供应商一大半，现在需结算完毕，股东们拿钱来付亏损，所以要点时间。”&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;实际上，对于在校内开设小卖部，有关部门一直有所管控。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2019年12月，教育部、市场监管总局等四部门联合印发《关于落实主体责任强化校园食品安全管理的指导意见》，要求非寄宿制中小学、幼儿园原则上不得在校内设置食品小卖部、超市，已经设置的，要逐步退出。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;高要区教育局一位工作人员向南方周末记者介绍，他们曾反复研讨过这份指导意见，认为意见并没有要求学校完全不能开设小卖部。目前高要区只在寄宿学校中开设小卖部，以满足学生需求。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;对政府而言，小卖部租金也是一笔财政收入。上述多地政府部门的工作人员均向南方周末记者表示，按照财政部对非税收入的管理规定，公立学校小卖部作为国有资产，其租金收入目前都统一上缴国库，按收支两条线进行管理。&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;综合评分&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;高要区没有对小卖部一关了之，为了解决部分寄宿学校实际需求与“天价”租金之间的矛盾，对招标方式进行了改革。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;上述高要区教育局工作人员表示，全区总共有七八十家公办学校，目前25家仍设有校内小卖部。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2022年3月，高要区将18家租约到期的校内小卖部进行打包，统一招租。评标方式也从“价高者得”变为“综合评分”。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;全国公共资源交易平台发布的公告显示，这一整体招租项目5年租金挂牌价1062万元，最终以1221万元成交。平均一家小卖部年租金仅13.6万元，比高要二中之前的价格低两百多万元。中标人为佛山市活道投资有限公司（下称活道投资）。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;南方周末记者探访了其中一家校内小卖部，发现其挂上了广东省道诚百货有限公司（下称道诚百货）的营业执照。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2022年6月以来，道诚百货先后注册成立18家公司，地址分布在高要区打包招标小卖部的18家公立学校内。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;活道投资与道诚百货是什么关系？&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;上述高要区教育局工作人员表示，“道诚”是活道投资的品牌。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;企查查显示，活道投资法定代表人为戴朝国，他也曾是道诚百货的法定代表人。2023年3月1日，道诚百货法定代表人变更为李瑞强，他是道诚百货唯一股东。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2023年6月，道诚百货与国企肇庆市高要高庆农业科技发展有限公司等，共同投资成立了一家公司，李瑞强任监事。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;为什么将18家学校小卖部打包出租，并且租金比之前低？&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;上述高要区教育局工作人员解释，打包招租是为了方便管理，并规避“天价”租金。招标时也会选择有实力的公司，避免出现后续无力经营的情况。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;具体的评标办法政府方面并未披露，相关公告显示，招标采用综合评分法确定中标人。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;2023年9月，肇庆宣卿中学的小卖部招租同样采用综合评分法，学校同时发布了一份评标报告：评标根据技术与商务评审得分、价格评审得分计算综合得分，综合得分高者中标。&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;宣卿中学三位中标候选人中，租金报价最高的公司，综合得分最低。&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;（应受访者要求，张雪瑞为化名）&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;获取更多RSS：&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot;

&lt;p>;September 1973 On the 11th, in Santiago, the capital of Chile, at the presidential palace surrounded by coup soldiers, Chilean President Salvador Allende from the left-wing camp gave a radio speech expressing his determination to fight to the end. Later that day, the presidential palace was captured and Allende was killed in the line of duty. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“This coup opened one of the darkest chapters in Chilean history.” A report by Cuba’s Latin American News Agency commented. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;September 11 this year marks the 50th anniversary of the overthrow of the Allende government by a coup. Over the past half century, many historical studies and declassified archives have shown that the United States went to great lengths and used all means to prevent Allende from coming to power and overthrow the Allende government. This year also marks the 200th anniversary of the &quot;Monroe Doctrine&quot; proposed by the United States. For a long time, the United States has held hegemony, manipulated the rhetoric of &quot;democracy and freedom&quot;, and used coup intervention, economic sanctions and other means to cause deep suffering to Latin American countries and people. Nowadays, more and more Latin American countries and people are awakening, and their voices against US hegemonic interference are rising day by day. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;a>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/4e16d2ae2dfe95e2b91054641f81e9fb.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity : 1;&quot; width=&quot;1000&quot; height=&quot;667&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/4e16d2ae2dfe95e2b91054641f81e9fb.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;250505&quot; >;&lt;/a>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span>;On September 11, 2022, in Santiago, the capital of Chile, a man held a red carnation in front of the memorial The 49th anniversary of the death of President Allende. (&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;Xinhua News Agency, photo by Jorge Villegas)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;The only chance of success is to launch a military coup&quot;&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot; strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&quot;It is clear that any form of political or constitutional approach to preventing the Allende government from exercising power is unlikely to succeed. The only chance of success is before or after Allende takes power. Immediately launch a military coup... It is hoped that the intelligence station will establish direct contact with as many influential military figures as possible.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On September 9, 1970, the CIA sent a secret cable to its intelligence station in Chile. Earlier, voting in the Chilean presidential election had just concluded. Allende, the candidate of the Popular Unity Front of the left-wing political party alliance, came first in the vote, which made the US government very angry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The US government’s suppression of Allende can be traced back to 1964. This year, Allende, who was defeated in the previous Chilean presidential election, ran again. At that time, the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union was raging, and the U.S. government, which regarded Latin America as its &quot;backyard,&quot; did not want to see this left-wing leader elected as the president of Chile. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As a result, the United States secretly supported Allende’s campaign opponents, provided millions of dollars in campaign funds to the parties of Allende’s opponents, and funded Chilean right-wing groups and media through the CIA to publish a large number of attacks and discredit Allende. Germany&#39;s message encourages people not to vote for him. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The U.S. intervention achieved what it wanted, and Allende lost the 1964 presidential election. These behind-the-scenes manipulations obviously go against the &quot;democracy&quot; rhetoric that the United States has always promoted, but the absurd reason given by American politicians is that the damage caused by US intervention to Chile is less than the harm that a left-wing government that came to power through democratic elections might cause. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On September 4, 1970, Chile held a presidential election. Allende, who ran again, came first in the vote, but did not get more than half of the votes. According to the law, Congress must vote for the president among the top two candidates. Seeing that a &quot;second Cuba&quot; was about to emerge in Latin America, the panicked U.S. government decided to step up its intervention efforts to prevent Allende from winning the congressional vote. On September 15, then US President Richard Nixon issued instructions to CIA Director Richard Helms and others: &quot;Don&#39;t consider the risks, don&#39;t involve the embassy, ​​US$10 million in available funds, and more if necessary.&quot; Work day and night, select our best people... Let Chile&#39;s economy scream in pain, and come up with an action plan within 48 hours.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The plan the CIA came up with was to stage a military coup in Chile. Documents later declassified by the CIA showed that the United States promised some Chilean military officers that if they launched a coup, the United States would provide any assistance other than direct troops. The then commander of the Chilean Army, Rene Schneider, firmly opposed the coup and therefore became a &quot;thorn in the side&quot; of the CIA. On October 22, 1970, he was attacked by a gang associated with the CIA and died a few days later. The U.S. move was self-defeating and shocked the entire country of Chile, raising voices against foreign interference. In the congressional vote held on October 24, Allende won by a clear advantage and was elected President of Chile. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;a>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/5c180aa6ab63290afe289dd730c92787.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity : 1;&quot; width=&quot;1000&quot; height=&quot;667&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/5c180aa6ab63290afe289dd730c92787.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;250504&quot; >;&lt;/a>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span>;On September 11, 2022, people gathered in Santiago, the capital of Chile, to commemorate former President Allende 49th anniversary of the death.

The United States was afraid that Allende&#39;s model of coming to power through democratic elections would spread, lead to the rise of a left-wing wave in Latin America, and challenge the hegemony of the United States in Latin America. Therefore, after the failure of its first attempt to instigate a coup in 1970, the United States decided to focus on politics, economy, and military. All parties worked together to weaken the Allende government and create conditions for promoting a coup in Chile. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On the political level, according to the New York Times, the US government allocated US$815,000 to create divisions among various parties within the Allende government. Between 1970 and 1973, the CIA spent a total of more than $8 million in Chile, most of which was used to fund strikes, demonstrations and other activities organized by right-wing opposition groups. At the same time, the CIA&#39;s &quot;black propaganda machine&quot;, which had been honed in the 1964 Chilean elections, was operating at high speed. Information collected by Chilean journalist Victor Herrero shows that between September 15 and November 3, 1973 alone, the CIA published 726 slanderous articles through various channels in Chile and abroad, accusing Allende of wanting to The media exerts control. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the economic level, in order to combat the Chilean economy, the U.S. government on the one hand prevents international financial institutions such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund from providing loans to Chile; on the other hand, it suppresses copper prices in the international market and attacks the export of copper products. This is an important source of foreign exchange for Chile. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At the military level, the &quot;Chilean Secret Operations 1963-1973&quot; report released by the US government shows that the United States continues to provide assistance to the Chilean military, maintains high arms sales to Chile, and trains a large number of Chilean military officers. , to cultivate pro-American forces within the Chilean military. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Under the influence of a series of sabotage and suppression measures by the United States, by the eve of the 1973 coup, the Allende government was in trouble: there were serious divisions within the government, domestic prices were soaring, protests were frequent, and the military was becoming increasingly divided. Hair is unstable. Finally, on September 11 of that year, Augusto Pinochet, the then commander of the Chilean Army, launched a coup and overthrew the Allende government. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Without the support and financial assistance from the United States, the Chilean opposition would not be so strong.&quot; Chilean historian Victor Boulanghier told Xinhua News Agency. Chilean academic circles generally believe that US intervention created conditions for the Chilean army to launch a coup, leading to the collapse of the Allende government. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since then, the 17-year military rule has caused great harm to Chile. Chilean official data shows that during this period, more than 40,000 people were arrested for political reasons in Chile, more than 3,000 people died at the hands of the secret police or disappeared, and at least 200,000 people were forced into exile overseas. The United States cannot absolve itself of the blame for this. As an article in the British &quot;Guardian&quot; said: &quot;The hands of the United States are stained with the blood of Chileans.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Chilean Communist Party Representative Luis Cuello said that the United States&#39; intervention &quot;profoundly changed Chile.&quot; historical process, violates international law&#39;s protection of the rights of countries to choose their own political and social systems, and is a systematic violation of human rights.&quot; Former Chilean Senator Alejandro Navarro said: &quot;The United States has never cared about the democracy of the American people, but only cares about its own economic and political interests. The United States regards Chile and Latin American countries as its own &#39;property&#39;, Anyone who affects U.S. interests automatically becomes its enemy.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/69c4f486f25ac1460659c3de23a5090d.jpeg &quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1000&quot; height=&quot;667&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/69c4f486f25ac1460659c3de23a5090d .jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;250506&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span>;On September 11, 2021, people were in the Plaza de la Constitución in Santiago, the capital of Chile. rallied in front of the statue of former President Allende to commemorate the 48th anniversary of Allende&#39;s death. (&lt;/span>;&lt;span>;Published by Xinhua News Agency, photo by Jorge Villegas)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;The &quot;Monroe Doctrine&quot; is imperialist power politics&lt;/strong>; &lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;The tragedy of Allende fully exposed the hypocrisy and hegemony of the United States. The history of Latin America has proven that when the governments of some countries are not in line with the wishes of the United States, politicians in Washington will not hesitate to plan and instigate coups, and even go so far as to personally carry out butcher knives. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 1915, turmoil broke out in Haiti. The United States sent troops to Haiti on the grounds of &quot;protecting expatriates&quot; and exercised full control over the country. It did not withdraw its troops until 1934. In the early 1950s, the Guatemalan government implemented land reform and distributed the idle land of the American-owned United Fruit Company to landless farmers. The U.S. government, with lobbying from the United Fruit Company, supported Castillo Armas in launching a coup to overthrow the government. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Various actions of the United States have aroused dissatisfaction in Latin America. In recent years, the will of Latin American countries to oppose U.S. hegemony has become stronger and stronger: In March 2022, the Panamanian government announced that December 20 will be designated as a &quot;National Day of Mourning&quot; to commemorate the victims of the U.S. military operation against Panama in 1989. ; During the Summit of the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States in January this year, participating leaders jointly urged the United States to end its long-term blockade on Cuba; in June, Nicaraguan President Ortega sent a letter to United Nations Secretary-General Guterres, demanding that the United States pay more than 120 US$100 million in compensation to fulfill the International Court of Justice&#39;s judgment on the United States&#39; funding of the Nicaraguan civil war in the 1980s. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In a recent interview with a reporter from Xinhua News Agency, Fernando Huanacuuni, the former Foreign Minister of Bolivia, pointed out that for the past 200 years, the United States has adhered to the &quot;Monroe Doctrine&quot; and regarded Latin America as its &quot;backyard&quot;, using hegemony and interference to These actions hinder the development of Latin American countries and seize resources in the region. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>; &quot;The essence of the &#39;Monroe Doctrine&#39; is to interfere in Latin American countries and promote hegemony in Latin America,&quot; Vanakuni said. &quot;There have been countless examples of the United States blatantly interfering in the internal affairs of Latin American countries over the past 200 years. This is completely It is the power politics of imperialism, which is destined to fail because more and more countries want to independently determine their own democracy, economic model and national governance model.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 13 Sep 2023 17:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[打赏秀才的老年人，直播间里的情感供养]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256572]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-13 16:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/ 09/13/OvdWo957x5iBiGHa4n3ZmrxPa6RErMw0RrFaaeeJ.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;781&quot; height=&quot;625&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/OvdWo957x5iBiGHa4n3ZmrxPa6RErM w0RrFaaeeJ. jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250514&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Behind the short videos are the emotions that the elderly cannot place. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lu Ermei, a female assembly line worker, once pinned her hopes for a counterattack in life on making short videos. superior. She tried documenting her life and singing lip-syncs, but she persisted for a long time but no one took notice. In the end, the most popular works were those that were &quot;co-produced&quot; with famous Internet celebrities. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;When all romance returns to nature and tranquility reaches far away, will you grow old together with me?&quot; In a video pinned to the top by Lu Ermei, photos of her and Xiucai were combined. Together, they smiled and cuddled up to each other. Amidst the accompaniment of earthy love songs and the special effects of flying red hearts, this sincere &quot;vow&quot; was played on the screen. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It must be said that in addition to the purpose of operating a video account, the video also contains the admiration of the host and fans for the show. This video received more than 200 hearts and 39 comments, such as &quot;a perfect match&quot;, &quot;perfectly matched with the handsome guy&quot;, and &quot;may the scholar brother not grow old and stay with his sister until he grows old&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The price Lu Ermei paid for this was a reward of more than 100,000 yuan. &quot;There is a sister who gave a reward of more than 500,000 yuan, but she did not get it back.&quot; Before the scholar&#39;s accident, Lu Ermei regretted her lack of calmness and whims. &quot;Now that his account has been blocked, I will Very happy.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;On September 2, 2023, the anchor Xiucai, who has tens of millions of fans and is known as the &quot;harvester of middle-aged and elderly women&quot;, had her short video account banned for violating the relevant regulations of the platform. Previously, the scholar&#39;s signature moves of pretending to be shy, lifting his hair, covering his mouth, and ogling, were imitated and parodied, and spread virally on major platforms. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The scholar’s ​​ban also exposed his “crazy fans” to the spotlight. Among Xiu Cai&#39;s fans, there are many &quot;true fans&quot; like Lu Ermei who reward hundreds of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of yuan. What kind of charm do these elderly emotional anchors have that can make fans donate generously? What are these middle-aged and elderly people who spend a lot of money really looking forward to? &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Induced &quot;reflux&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Lu Ermei&#39;s hometown is Huaining County, Anhui Province, and she works in a garment factory in Changshu City, Jiangsu Province. Because she is the second eldest child in the family and is called the second sister of the Lu family, she simply named her short video account &quot;The Second Sister of the Lu Family&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;She has been a fan of Xiucai for three or four years. At the beginning, Xiucai only had 500,000 or 600,000 fans, but later it skyrocketed to tens of millions. &quot;He said he was going to teach me how to make videos and asked me to help him play PK.&quot; Lu Ermei recalled the initial exchanges between the two to Southern Weekend reporters. Because she gave gifts to the scholar, she got many opportunities to communicate with him and established initial trust. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to public information, Xiucai is a 39-year-old native of Mengcheng, Anhui Province. His family background was average. In his early years, he and his wife worked in Suzhou, and their children stayed in their hometown to attend boarding school. A few years ago, at the suggestion of a classmate, I started shooting short videos. At first, they were mainly about migrant workers, and gradually turned into anchors wearing suits and singing lip-sync. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Gradually, Lu Ermei came up with the idea of ​​making short videos. She posted the composite video with Xiucai on her account and accumulated some fans. However, the most direct way to get the opportunity to be exposed is to interact with the talents in the live broadcast room, and this requires buying gifts. From the most basic little hearts, gold chains, and hot air balloons to valuable Porsches and helicopters, Lu Ermei went all the way up, and she frequently received compliments from scholars: She is very beautiful, and she should listen to her brother, etc. wait. Xiucai also praised Ermei for doing a good job in her video and her fans were increasing quickly. Lu Ermei was very happy and replied, &quot;It&#39;s all because of you.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Lu Ermei got Xiucai’s promise to help her create an account, but there were more and more requests for rewards. &quot;Just let me help him with PK, and ask me to help him in the live broadcast room.&quot; The so-called PK is a common form of popularity competition on live broadcast platforms. The anchors show off their talents or skills and call on their fans to give rewards. The method is &quot;upvote&quot;. Whoever gets the most rewards will be the winner of the PK competition. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In the fierce competition, scholars frequently asked for rewards of &quot;carriage&quot; and &quot;Hua Zi&quot;. &quot;Hua Zi&quot; is the common name for the gift &quot;Carnival&quot;, which is equivalent to RMB 3,000. The most recent reward was more than 4,000 yuan from Lu Ermei during a live broadcast. Over the past few years, she claimed to have consumed more than 100,000 yuan in savings. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“It is a relatively common form to create an account and lead an apprentice.” Liangzhou (screen name) is a knowledge-based blogger on social platforms. She used to be responsible for the virtual anchor business in an MCN company. As a short-term An in-depth user and long-term observer of the video platform, she attracted attention for her series of blog posts analyzing the phenomenon of &quot;scholars&quot;. She told Southern Weekend reporters that this method of promising to teach people how to create an account in order to ask for rewards is deceptive and misleading to a certain extent. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liangzhou analyzed that in addition to the form of &quot;teaching how to create an account&quot;, the more direct way of inducement is to &quot;fight backflow&quot;: &quot;It is to act as a support to increase the popularity of the live broadcast room.&quot; The so-called fighting Returning means that the anchor and the fans agree in advance that the fans will help buy gifts in the live broadcast room to increase their popularity, and the anchor will refund the amount they spent in private. However, because the platform will take half of the water, the cost of returning it is very high, and because it involves data fraud, the platform does not encourage or even prohibit this behavior. Therefore, reshoring is usually an operation used by MCN organizations to recruit new talents. Personal promises to fight back are often suspected of inducement and deception. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to media reports, a 62-year-old woman from Beijing said that she rewarded scholars with more than 520,000 yuan in the form of gifts. She said that the reason for being so generous was that the scholar promised her that he would not treat her badly and would return the money, but the promise was never fulfilled. In the past three years, she has been asking Xiucai for the 520,000 yuan, but only 17,000 yuan was recovered. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;He is such a ruthless thing&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;However, Lu Ermei&#39;s short video account has not been launched, and the number of fans has remained at more than 10,000 , she did not have the financial resources to continue to reward, so the scholar stopped talking to her in the live broadcast room. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;He said he voluntarily swiped gifts, and it&#39;s impossible for others to use my mobile phone to swipe it, right?&quot; In 2021, Lu Ermei went to Mengcheng, Anhui to find a scholar to discuss the theory, but was scolded by the other party. Later, He was also blocked by the other party, saying, &quot;He is such a heartless and meaningless thing.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Although there are mixed ideas of making a short video account, in the minds of fans, the most attractive reason is the emotional value provided by the anchor, but this value requires money to support. &quot;This type of anchor actually has poor ability to &#39;organize&#39;.&quot; Liang Zhou analyzed that in order to attract fans, many live broadcast rooms will set up studios with lighting, props and furnishings, and have rich talent displays, and some will even design scripts. , relatively speaking, there will be much less emotional live broadcast routines for the elderly. &quot;Old people don&#39;t like to be noisy, what they need is companionship.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/UXZYTnTr7JHSV5qkyvCfGgwpNodqtpXVV7xWen9D.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height= &quot;452&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/UXZYTnTr7JHSV5qkyvCfGgwpNodqtpXVV7xWen9D.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250515&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;The classic shy expression of a scholar. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Internet screenshots/pictures)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Liangzhou registered a new account and deliberately liked and collected videos of senior citizens to feed the account&#39;s popularity &quot;Habit&quot; opens up a new world. For the first time in the homepage recommendation, she came across a live broadcast room where the elderly were grouped together. The users who were connected were all men in their sixties. They also played PK. The audience could designate the anchor among them to &quot;open the arena&quot;. Then vote for them separately. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, there was no talent show in this PK, only voice chatting with fans, mostly middle-aged and elderly women. Liangzhou judged from the chat content that the two were familiar with each other and it was not the first time they were on the mic. The anchor used instant messaging software to call fans to come over and help &quot;vote.&quot; The content of the chat is also very common: What kind of tea did you drink today? Is the road easy to walk or not? If it rains, don&#39;t go out because your shoes will get muddy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;These words must not be heard by her at home.&quot; Liang Zhou said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Judging from the video and comments, the anchor ran a business when he was young and was considered a prominent figure in their local village. However, although he is much older than Xiucai, his video style is similar, with fixed scenes and fixed music, and he is usually holding a purple clay pot and making tea. The uncle’s account only has 10,000 to 20,000 fans, but the interaction volume is very high. Each video has thousands of likes, and the number of comments is close to half or one-third of the likes. Through this PK, the anchor got more than 6,000 votes, which were converted into money and he could get 300 yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xiucai first came out of the industry because in May 2023, a 70-year-old woman took a train alone to Mengcheng, Anhui Province to seek an offline meeting. Sister Zhang was a classmate of the scholar and had been a short video partner for a period of time. She claimed that her relationship with the scholar later deteriorated because she discovered that the scholar promised to meet his fans in private as an inducement and asked fans to give him large gifts. Sister Zhang believes that this breaks the moral bottom line and is not a very honorable thing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sister Zhang considers herself to be the leader of short videos made by scholars, and she felt ashamed to see such a situation. In July 2023, she began to publicly solicit victims who were &quot;deceived&quot; by scholars on the short video platform. . A girl in her twenties asked for help. Her parents had divorced. After her mother fell in love with a scholar, she gave him a reward of more than 10,000 yuan and talked about going to find the scholar. She and her brother could not persuade her. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“It’s unclear whether the old lady in her seventies came here to give him a reward, but the fact that the old lady came to us is definitely related to them.” Sister Zhang told Nanfang a reporter said over the weekend. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;Fans of Xiu Cai&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Liang Zhou also browsed the account of an active fan of the uncle anchor mentioned above. His character image is very clear: in his early career Yousheng is now widowed, her son is married and has settled in a big city, while she lives alone in her hometown. What is particularly impressive is that this woman has a strong desire to share. The most she posted was 33 videos in one day. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;She seems to have no one to talk to in real life.&quot; Liang Zhou said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“I support my grandma to watch short videos of scholars.” Xiao Xie is a post-90s generation who has been working for three years. She told a Southern Weekend reporter that her grandma is 68 years old and was in good health a few years ago. , I would also go to square dance. In 2022, I accidentally fell and fractured my bones. After recovery, I rarely went out and developed the habit of checking my mobile phone. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Xiao Xie said that her grandfather had used a smartphone a few years ago and would hold it all day long. Grandpa and grandma seldom communicated with each other in daily life. After grandpa became addicted to using his mobile phone, the two of them talked less. Until grandma also used a smartphone, she gained a lot of emotional sustenance. The two elderly people often stay up until one or two o&#39;clock in the evening, &quot;you can say they are very obsessed with it.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, Xiao Xie found that her grandma’s ability to distinguish was very low. She used to like &quot;Fake Jin Dong&quot;, but she couldn&#39;t tell it was fake. Later, she liked Xiucai, and many video platforms gradually appeared. Even if you imitate or pretend to be a scholar’s ​​account, grandma won’t be able to tell whether it is genuine or fake. &quot;I can&#39;t tell whether it&#39;s a platform or an anchor, an organization or an individual, but she believes it anyway.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Every time she goes back, grandma will explain her views on mate selection and tell her granddaughter to look for a scholar. The ideal type of boy is not only good-looking, but also very capable, and at the same time considerate and caring. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Grandma also thought of giving rewards to scholars. Every time Xiao Xie goes back, she will clean up the phone memory for her grandparents and close some unreliable accounts. She discovered that her grandma’s mobile phone had received text messages indicating failure to reward and failure to bind bank cards. &quot;I&#39;m too old to do this.&quot; The two old people&#39;s mobile phones have never been bound to bank cards. The family realized that they would not waste any money, and as long as the elderly were happy, they could feel free to let them watch short videos. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Not only the elderly, short videos are also the spiritual sustenance of Lu Ermei. &quot;Working in the factory is too tiring, and I have to move my hands and feet.&quot; Lu Ermei and his wife met in a garment factory in Changshu, Jiangsu. They have been married for more than ten years. However, over the years, her husband has worked in Changshu, Suzhou and other places. Get together less and stay apart more. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Working in a garment factory is very boring and I only have 3 days off every month. Because of making accounts and giving rewards, her relationship with her husband had a serious crisis. Her husband went to Suzhou to work alone. The two had little contact and were basically in a cold war. &quot;He (husband) was suspicious and thought I was betraying him.&quot; &quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;&lt;strong>;&quot;Growing old does not mean giving up all needs&quot;&lt;/strong>;&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;&quot;The elderly&#39;s blind pursuit of stars is different from ours. We chase stars and buy a concert ticket. At least these things can be seen on the surface, they are internal (emotional needs).&quot; Sister Zhang said that in the spiritual world of many elderly people, emotions are relatively lacking, and their empty hearts cannot be comforted. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Sister Zhang added that men usually die earlier than women, leaving the old lady alone; there are also cases where men go out to make money while women stay behind, and their emotional worlds are generally empty. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;Before, I saw a post saying that when women reach a certain age, their secretion of hormones decreases and they lose sexual desire. This is definitely wrong.&quot; Liangzhou said that when a person enters old age, it seems that The concept of losing vitality in a social sense also means that the related lust and emotional needs should not appear in the elderly - this is obviously a very incorrect perception. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“Companionship, humor, love, conversation and many other things are essential human needs. We want all these when we are young, but when we get older, age does not mean It means that we have given up all these needs. And society and the people around us should not directly ignore this series of needs. This is a manifestation of giving up basic responsibilities.&quot; Liang Zhou said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;In the process of scholars becoming popular, whether it is older women or middle-aged and elderly people, I think it is understandable to like scholars.&quot; Peng Huamao, a professor at the Institute of Developmental Psychology of Beijing Normal University, has been doing psychological cognition and training for the elderly for many years. According to the research, after observing some short videos and fan messages of scholars, she believed that these messages were a relatively flamboyant emotional expression and reflected the emotional needs of the elderly. “Many of these comments are about women’s desire for emotion. , or, in other words, the awakening of one’s own emotional needs within.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Peng Huamao analyzed that the emotional needs of this group rarely receive attention from the outside world, especially among middle-aged and elderly women. &quot;When you are young, you live for your family. When you get older, your value in the family is not reflected.&quot; She said that instead of exploring why scholars are popular, it is better to pay attention to the emotional needs of middle-aged and elderly people in real life. How to satisfy. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Peng Huamao said that there is a common misunderstanding in society that love will weaken with age, which makes everyone ignore the psychology of the elderly. Excessive ridicule and stigmatization will cover up the underlying problem. &quot;So, I think whether you give a reward to a scholar or pay attention to a scholar, it actually expresses that she needs a spiritual sustenance.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 13 Sep 2023 16:25:05 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[华为苹果新机接连亮相，你多久会换一台手机？]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256564]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-13 15:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;In the early morning of September 13th, Beijing time, the 2023 Apple Autumn Conference arrived as scheduled.

Under the spotlight, these imitation jewelry, jade and precious metals made of imitation jewelry reflect brilliant light. When the girl picks them up, she also picks up her imagination of beauty. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But behind the beauty, there may be hidden health risks. Many earrings and other imitation jewelry are &quot;three-no products&quot; - no production date, no quality certificate, no manufacturer, and even harmful elements such as cadmium, nickel, and lead exceed the standard. Wearing them may cause &quot;allergy&quot; and threaten your health. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The mandatory national standard &quot;Regulations on Limits of Hazardous Elements in Jewelry&quot; (GB 28480-2012) regulates harmful elements in non-precious metals (precious metals mainly refer to 8 metal elements such as gold, silver and platinum group metals) Relevant regulations have been set on the limit. Because piercings are in contact with the human body, earrings are more stringent than jewelry such as necklaces that are in contact with human skin. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, it has been ten years since the implementation of national standards. Due to high testing costs and lack of mandatory requirements, cases and recalls of alloy earrings and other imitation jewelry containing harmful elements exceeding the standard are still common. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;The amount of cadmium released in &quot;hot-selling&quot; earrings exceeds the standard by more than 7,000 times&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;What is the quality of &quot;hot-selling&quot; earrings with a total sales volume of more than 60,000 pieces and an average price of more than five yuan? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In June 2023, on an e-commerce platform, the non-toxic pioneer team of the environmental organization Shenzhen Zero Waste Environmental Protection Public Welfare Development Center (hereinafter referred to as the &quot;non-toxic pioneer&quot;) placed an order for the top-selling product 10 styles of earrings were sent to a qualified third-party laboratory for testing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;None of these 10 earrings have quality certificates, product names, manufacturer and other information labels. They are &quot;three noes&quot; products and violate the product quality law. The test report even showed that cadmium content in 3 models exceeded the standard by 6808 times, 6872 times, and 7208 times; nickel release in 4 models exceeded the standard by 0.25 times, 0.5 times, 0.5 times, and 1.8 times. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/oYt6uFkA6kDbYxGTmA7M4spKESuOui1aCpS6Apd2.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1280&quot; height= &quot;1332&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/oYt6uFkA6kDbYxGTmA7M4spKESuOui1aCpS6Apd2.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250507&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Test results of harmful elements in 10 earrings. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Non-Toxic Pioneer/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;After &quot;Non-Toxic Pioneer&quot; reported to the e-commerce platform, 6 products with excessive heavy metals have been downloaded shelf. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As a customer, Southern Weekend reporters inquired about the certificates of other products sold by these merchants. Some said that they “have no quality certificates,” while others claimed that they “have them but it is not convenient to provide them.” &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is not uncommon for imitation jewelry to contain harmful elements that exceed standards. In 2014, authors from the Zhuhai Quality, Metrology, Supervision and Inspection Institute published a paper stating that after testing 40 pieces of imitation jewelry in Zhuhai’s retail market, 19 items contained excessive levels of harmful elements, indicating “the overall quality problem is very serious.” There is basically no ingredient description on the packaging or markings of jewelry. Even large imitation jewelry processing companies only use names such as &quot;alloy/silver-plated/gold-plated jewelry&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In 2021, an author from the Guangdong Product Quality Supervision and Inspection Institute published a paper: 50 batches of simulated jewelry purchased on an online platform and the Guangzhou Jewelry Wholesale Market were tested, and 11 batches of harmful elements exceeded the standard. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Suqing, director of the National Jewelry Quality Inspection and Testing Center, is one of the drafters of the national standard &quot;Regulations on Limits of Hazardous Elements in Jewelry&quot;. She told Southern Weekend reporters that in 2007 and 2010, for domestic imitation jewelry , the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) twice proposed large-scale recalls, which attracted the attention of domestic regulatory authorities and promoted the introduction of national standards. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;my country’s supervision of the export of imitation jewelry is also becoming increasingly strict. Starting from January 1, 2011, imitation jewelry has been included in my country&#39;s import and export legal inspection product catalog - the import and export commodities that must be inspected are formulated and adjusted by the national commodity inspection department. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Even so, news of recalls of exported jewelry has remained frequent in recent years. On the official website of the &quot;Hebei Provincial Defective Product Recall Management Center&quot;, search with &quot;earrings&quot; as the keyword, from March 2018 to November 2022, there are 62 earring product recall information released by the EU, most of which are produced in China, and the defects are all Excessive levels of harmful elements such as cadmium, nickel or lead. According to statistics from the testing agency &quot;ETC Les Testing&quot;, in the second quarter of 2021, there were 66 recall notifications for imitation jewelry from European countries and Canada, including 41 cases of Chinese jewelry. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;There is still a lack of quantitative research on the health effects&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Many people have this experience. Their skin becomes red or even allergic when wearing jewelry, especially earrings. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhang Jinliang, a researcher at the Chinese Academy of Environmental Sciences, told Southern Weekend reporters that in addition to being related to personal constitution, another main reason for allergies may be that the amount of nickel released from jewelry exceeds the standard. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/jF5c9yTRnuv4kqrnnCTfDps3iCEoNsD9dw89Qzv2.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;720&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/jF5c9yTRnuv4kqrnnCTfDps3iCEoNsD9dw89Qzv2.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250511&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Four earrings that were found to have excessive nickel. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Non-Toxic Pioneer/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The production process of simulated jewelry includes design, molding, sand casting, welding, polishing, electroplating, etc. Through multiple processes, harmful elements such as cadmium, nickel, and lead appear to be excessive, in order to make the jewelry more beautiful and cost-effective. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Hua, a designer at a jewelry factory in the south, said that nickel is mainly produced in the electroplating process. The worse the electroplating process, the lower the cost, and the easier it is to release nickel. Zhang Jinliang said that in the production of jewelry, adding cadmium will increase the gloss and have an anti-rust effect. Adding lead can improve the flexibility of the jewelry and facilitate shaping. Lead and cadmium are also the main components of many pigments. If cheap earrings and other jewelry are rich in color, the content of these two harmful elements is more likely to exceed the standard. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/guumhbZZDicrgBhye5ii4ryU5TZwZspWZmmQXGHl.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;353&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/guumhbZZDicrgBhye5ii4ryU5TZwZspWZmmQXGHl.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250508&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;Three earrings that were found to have excessive levels of cadmium were all around 7,000 times the standard. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Non-toxic Pioneer/Picture)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The quality of raw materials is also very important. Zhang Jinliang said that the raw materials of some jewelry are scrap metal or low-quality alloys, which are cheap and may cause excessive heavy metal content. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The harmful elements in jewelry exceed the standard and will threaten human health. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhang Jinliang said that nickel can easily cause skin contact allergies, and long-term exposure to nickel may cause contact dermatitis, neurasthenia, and cancer reactions. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Cadmium has been certified as a carcinogen by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), and is listed as the sixth toxic substance harmful to human health by the United Nations Environment Program and the International Committee on Heavy Metals in Occupational Health. Chronic intake may cause high blood pressure, increase a person&#39;s risk of diabetes, and even cause severe bone damage. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among the alloy earrings tested by Non-Toxic Pioneer, 8 models were found to contain lead. Although the content meets the standard, it is still not recommended to wear them. Because lead is a cumulative poison that can enter the human body through the respiratory tract, digestive tract, skin, etc., lead poisoning will occur when the accumulation reaches a certain value. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Simulation jewelry with substandard quality is more harmful to children’s health. Children like to bite jewelry, and some lead products have a sweet taste. Scientific research has proven that the absorption rate of lead in the respiratory tract and lungs of children is much higher than that of adults. my country and other countries have also specifically set limits on harmful elements for jewelry worn by children ≤14 years old. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, there have been cases of recalls of children&#39;s jewelry in recent years. For example, from March 12 to 22, 2021, Health Canada issued 4 recall notices for children&#39;s imitation jewelry, involving 4 products, a total of 3,904 pieces, all produced in China. The reason for the recall was the lead and cadmium content in the products. Exceeds local standards. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, Zhang Jinliang also said that the toxicity of harmful elements is only a theoretical statement. Heavy metals mainly enter the human body through the respiratory tract and digestive tract, and the skin absorption is relatively small. At present, there is no quantitative research data on the impact of heavy metal exposure in earrings on human health; in addition, the piercing part of earrings has a small contact area with the human body. If the heavy metal exceeds the standard, it may cause some adverse reactions, but the probability of causing heavy metal poisoning is very high. Small, &quot;so there is no need to be too alarmist.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Zhang Jinliang suggested that if you wear earrings and other jewelry for a long time, try to choose precious metals such as gold, silver, and platinum. Their supervision is more standardized and their quality is better. Alloy jewelry with many styles, good shapes and low prices has different usage scenarios from precious metals. You can clean it with alcohol before wearing it, which will help reduce the exposure of heavy metals on the surface of the jewelry. Try not to wear alloy jewelry when exercising, bathing, swimming, etc. , because sweat may increase heavy metal exposure after contact with the alloy. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;There are hidden tricks in the testing industry&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;my country&#39;s imitation jewelry industry started in the 1980s. China is currently the world&#39;s largest exporter of imitation jewelry, forming three major distribution centers in Yiwu, Qingdao and Guangzhou. According to data from Yiwu City, there are more than 300,000 employees in Yiwu&#39;s jewelry industry, with annual sales of more than 20 billion yuan, accounting for more than 2/3 of the total output value of the national jewelry industry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/gRmBhVAobWJmAbyX2sObDLPh7cQTxyOheciRUyAC.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height= &quot;640&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/13/gRmBhVAobWJmAbyX2sObDLPh7cQTxyOheciRUyAC.jpg&quot; data-key=&quot;250509&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color : #999; text-align: center;&quot;>;In November 2017, Qingdao Airport Inspection and Quarantine Bureau and Liuting Airport Customs sampled a batch of incoming imitation jewelry and sent it to the laboratory for testing. The results showed that the sample of imitation jewelry contained lead. More than 30 times more than the standard. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #aaa;&quot;>;(Visual China/Photo)&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Simulated jewelry exported for sale on international e-commerce platforms such as Amazon must provide testing certificates that comply with local standards. For example, the European Union and Amazon require merchants to provide statements or test reports that can prove that products comply with &quot;REACH&quot; (Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals of the European Parliament and of the Council) regulations, including values ​​for harmful elements such as cadmium, nickel, and lead. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Many third-party testing companies provide testing services, but a Southern Weekend reporter’s investigation found that there are hidden “tricks” in the testing industry. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Southern Weekend reporter consulted as a jewelry manufacturer and found that the charge for testing the release of cadmium, nickel, and lead is between 500 yuan and 800 yuan per sample, and the time required is about 7 working days. . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For many imitation jewelry, this testing fee is equivalent to the cost of hundreds of products, so there are &quot;hidden rules&quot; for testing services. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“It’s possible to play around with the edges.” The customer service of a testing agency on Taobao said that REACH requires each product to provide a test report, but the agency can only conduct one actual test for multiple jewelry with similar materials, and other &quot; For &quot;Hitchhiking&quot; products that have not been tested, if you replace the photos with them and the test values ​​remain unchanged, you will also have an &quot;exclusive&quot; test report. The above-mentioned customer service stated that the agency can support a maximum of 10 packages for testing. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The customer service of some institutions also introduced the &quot;hidden rules&quot; for packaging and testing in larger quantities. &quot;More than 100 models (packaged for testing) are a bit exaggerated, because export customs clearance and selling on the platform are risky, and the customs and the platform may doubt the authenticity of the test report.&quot; Yang Le, customer service of this testing agency, said to the south A reporter from the weekend said that this kind of demand from customers is very common. &quot;Considering cost issues, it is impossible to test every product, so our customers will put many products together for testing in the name of &#39;series&#39;.&quot; . &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yang Le said that if jewelry companies are worried that the actual measured harmful elements in their products exceed the standard, they can also provide a &quot;certificate package&quot; service and issue a non-actually measured test report, and the test results can be filled in at will. &quot;This test report must also be uploaded and filed. Although we have not tested it, it is exactly the same as the test report of the actual test.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;But the premise of &quot;guaranteed certificate&quot; is that the customer needs to sign a contract with the testing agency Disclaimer, exempting the testing company from liability. The disclaimer template sent by Yang Le reads: &quot;In consideration of the time relationship of customer needs, after negotiation between the two parties, the testing agency evaluates and issues certificates and reports according to customer requirements. At the same time, the customer promises that the product is qualified and ensures that the products in the sales market meet the requirements. If there is any non-compliance, the testing agency will not assume any legal responsibility or compensation obligations.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Yang Le said that the fee for &quot;package certificate&quot; and packaged testing of multiple products are the same, both 700 yuan. Since the &quot;certificate package&quot; does not require actual testing, it only takes 5 working days to complete. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;New standards are being revised&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;Similar to most products, the supervision of imitation jewelry is based on laws and regulations such as the Product Quality Law and the Import and Export Commodity Inspection Law. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The Product Quality Law stipulates that producers shall be responsible for the quality of the products they produce; if there are national standards and industry standards to protect human health and personal and property safety, product quality shall comply with such standards. Li Suqing said that the simulation jewelry produced and sold by merchants must meet the national standard requirements, but when it is launched in the country, it is not required to undergo compulsory product certification like food, home appliances and other consumer goods. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;For example, home appliances must obtain &quot;3C Certification&quot; (China Compulsory Certification, China Compulsory Product Certification) before they can be put on the market. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Suqing believes that if imitation jewelry is included in the 3C compulsory catalog, there will be difficulties and controversy. For earrings that sell for a few yuan, it is unrealistic to ask merchants to spend hundreds of yuan to detect harmful elements. &quot;It will not only increase the costs for merchants and consumers, but also increase the cost of law enforcement.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The market supervision department mainly adopts random inspections to supervise imitation jewelry. For example, Yiwu City has carried out several special rectifications on alloy jewelry and carried out supervision and spot inspections on an annual basis. The 17 batches of products randomly inspected in 2022 were all qualified after being tested by third-party testing agencies. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;At present, whether simulated jewelry is sent for inspection mainly depends on customer demand. &quot;Many customers do not need test reports because it will increase costs.&quot; Li Hua said. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;A senior person in the testing industry told Southern Weekend reporters that in China, e-commerce platforms such as Tmall and JD.com and some large supermarkets will require merchants to provide quality inspection reports for jewelry, but some e-commerce platforms Commercial platforms and many offline sales venues do not require this. Li Benben, communications director of the Shenzhen Zero Waste Environmental Protection Public Welfare Development Center, said that Toxic-Free Pioneer plans to collect more earring samples from multiple e-commerce platforms in 2024 to investigate product quality. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Suqing suggested that to improve the qualification rate of imitation jewelry, the illegal costs of enterprises must be increased. According to public information, few jewelry manufacturers have been punished for substandard harmful elements in their products. The Product Quality Law stipulates that those who produce or sell products that do not meet the national standards for protecting human health and personal and property safety may be fined not less than three times the value of the illegally produced or sold products; if the circumstances are serious, the product may be revoked. Business license; if it constitutes a crime, criminal liability will be pursued in accordance with the law. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The shapes of earrings and other accessories are becoming more and more complex, and the ingredients are not only simulated metals, but also textiles and even batteries. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Li Suqing revealed that the national standard promulgated 11 years ago is being revised. The new version of the national standard in terms of chemical properties may further tighten the limit requirements on lead content; it may also add some requirements on mechanical and physical properties. For example, there are certain regulations on the position of jewelry needle tips and battery-containing jewelry. The specific changes will be subject to the final standards. &lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;font-family: 楷体, 楷体_GB2312, STKaiti;&quot;>;（李华、杨乐为化名，南方周末实习生梁成媛亦有贡献）&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 13 Sep 2023 14:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[公职人员做发型被拒，税务局翌日上门查税：这样的营商环境如何让人安心丨快评]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256530]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-13 13:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Recently, a woman in Tancheng County, Linyi City, Shandong Province threatened a barber shop by showing photos of her uniform, which became a trend on social media. Search. On September 8, the Tancheng County Joint Investigation Team reported that the woman was a staff member of the County Agriculture and Rural Affairs Bureau, and she was given a major demerit. This incident cannot be taken lightly, because it is not just a matter of &quot;the low quality of individual public officials&quot;. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to an interview with Mr. Xu, the owner of the barber shop, by Chinese Business Daily, Dafeng News and other media, on August 30, the woman came to the shop to do a &quot;protein correction&quot; hair care project. The hairstylist assessed her hair and said her hair was too dry to do the job. As a result, the woman showed the &quot;uniform photo&quot; on her mobile phone and threatened to &quot;call people from our brigade to come (investigate and deal with the case).&quot; Mr. Xu thought she was just saying harsh words to scare people, but he didn’t expect that tax bureau personnel would come to check the tax the next day. After confirming that there was no tax evasion problem in the barber shop, they would also ask for every account of Charlie’s hair shop since it opened. Mr. Xu was so angry that he posted the surveillance video online. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Netizens have speculated who this woman is. She can easily mobilize the tax bureau to investigate taxes if she is unhappy. However, both the Tancheng County Taxation Bureau and the Market Supervision Bureau denied that the woman was their staff. After the video attracted attention online, on September 6, two men who claimed to be the woman&#39;s colleagues went to the barber shop to apologize to the owner, but still did not reveal what company she worked for. It was not until this incident became more and more intense online that Tancheng County issued a notice in the name of the joint investigation team on September 8, confirming that the woman was Wang Moumou, a staff member of the county&#39;s Agriculture and Rural Affairs Bureau. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;What this Wang Moumou did reminds people of the &quot;borrowed personnel&quot; of a certain district transportation bureau in Harbin more than a year ago. Because the online ride-hailing driver refused to allow him to smoke in the car, he called the &quot;brothers&quot; from the Transportation Bureau to check on illegal cars and &quot;deal with&quot; the online ride-hailing driver. Why do public officials dare to call &quot;brothers&quot; to inspect cars when they are not performing official duties, or threaten barbershops by showing photos of themselves in uniform? I&#39;m afraid it&#39;s still a sense of superiority: If you don&#39;t follow my requirements, I can punish you. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the one from Harbin is from the Transportation Bureau (although he is &quot;borrowed&quot;) and has the power to investigate and deal with illegally operated vehicles, so he can &quot;handle&quot; online ride-hailing drivers. And this Wang Moumou from Tancheng is from the Agriculture and Rural Affairs Bureau. How could Wang Moumou mobilize the tax bureau to investigate taxes? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to Tancheng County’s official announcement, she called the 12345 citizen hotline to report the incident. However, most netizens are skeptical about this. After the woman made the threat, the tax bureau came to inspect the tax the next day. Moreover, after the tax bureau confirmed that the barber shop had just opened for a few months and had not yet reached the tax filing period and that there was no tax evasion problem, it also demanded every account from Charlie&#39;s hair shop since its opening on the grounds that the whistleblower was not satisfied. If an ordinary citizen calls the hotline to report, will the tax bureau respond so quickly? Will every account within a few months be verified after confirming that there is no tax evasion? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Netizens’ doubts are not unreasonable. Why is the tax bureau so concerned about such a report? Relevant parties in Tancheng County should disclose Wang&#39;s phone recordings or online reporting records to clarify the facts. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;In addition to showing off his power and threatening the store, netizens also suspected that Wang Moumou was absent from work at will. According to video surveillance, the incident occurred at about 9:40 a.m. on August 30. Tancheng County did not explain in its report why Wang Moumou could go to the barber shop to have his hair done on Wednesday morning. Does the Agricultural and Rural Affairs Bureau&#39;s &quot;lax management of staff&quot; mentioned in the bulletin include its lax management of attendance? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Behind this incident are public concerns about the local business environment. Just imagine, an ordinary public official can show off his power and threaten, and he can torment operators at will with just a phone call. Who would dare to come here to invest and start a business? &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From this perspective, the investigation and processing results reported by the Tancheng County Joint Investigation Team may be difficult to eliminate public doubts about the local business environment. In an interview with CCTV, the barber shop owner said that he &quot;hopes that the normal operation of the barber shop will not be affected in the future.&quot; This also shows that he is still worried about whether he can operate normally in the future and whether he will be retaliated against again. Relevant parties in Tancheng need to disclose the incident more transparently, and at the same time introduce corresponding measures to prevent merchants operating normally from being unreasonably tortured just because of a &quot;reporting phone number.&quot; &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 13 Sep 2023 13:25:03 +0800</pubDate> </item><item><title><![CDATA[IPO收紧撤单潮起：36起超370亿募资喊停]]></title><link/><![CDATA[http://www.infzm.com/contents/256518]]><description> &lt;div>;&lt;i>;2023-09-13 12:00:00&lt;/i>;&lt;/div>;&lt;p>;Since the China Securities Regulatory Commission made it clear at the end of August that it would tighten IPOs in stages, the long-rumored market listing has become more difficult. It started slowly but gradually became solid. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Comprehensive interviews and research by reporters from the 21st Century Business Herald found that, in fact, as early as July 24, when the Political Bureau meeting of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China first proposed &quot;activating the capital market and boosting investor confidence,&quot; IPOs had already become obvious. Be strict. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to Wind data statistics, from July 24 to September 10, a total of 36 companies planning to IPO on the Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Exchanges withdrew or terminated their registration. Among them, there are up to 18 companies on the GEM, 4 on the Science and Technology Innovation Board, 11 on the Shanghai Stock Exchange Main Board, and 3 on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange Main Board, raising a total of 37.814 billion yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/12/5a2dfc0c3241535e10176d2e83b60319.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1; &quot; width=&quot;1000&quot; height=&quot;700&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com/cms/medias/image/23/09/12/5a2dfc0c3241535e10176d2e83b60319.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;250411&quot;>;&lt;/ p>; &lt;h4>;The net profit threshold for listing is raised&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;A senior insurance agent of a leading brokerage firm who has been in the industry for nearly 20 years told reporters that whenever IPOs are tightened, net profit often becomes a &quot;hard indicator&quot; for listing, and various sectors have The requirements for net profit bottom line have increased. Today, this situation appears again. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&quot;In the past, the main board could achieve success with a net profit of 80 million yuan, but now it is basically hopeless if it is less than 100 million yuan. It was more likely that the GEM would be listed at 60 million yuan last year, but now it is almost impossible to achieve less than 80 million yuan. . The fifth set of standards for the Science and Technology Innovation Board has been suspended. Once there is a large loss, even hard-core technology companies will not be able to go public. For companies with technological attributes but not hard enough, as long as they suffer losses, the listing process is likely to be blocked. Moreover, each sector has a negative impact on the listing process. The net profit requirement is not only for the most recent fiscal year. If there has been substandard performance or performance decline in recent years, sustainable profitability will be questioned, and it is also likely to be stopped.&quot; The above-mentioned Baodai told reporters. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Judging from Wind data, the statement of the senior insurance agent has been confirmed. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;From July 24th to September 10th, a total of three companies on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange main board withdrew, two of which had a net profit of less than 90 million yuan; although the other one had a net profit of 122 million yuan in 2022, it will not be listed in 2021. The annual net profit was only 94 million yuan, a year-on-year decrease of 20.39%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among the 11 companies withdrew from the Shanghai Stock Exchange Main Board, 4 had net profits of less than 90 million yuan last year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among the 18 companies withdrawn from the GEM, 12 will have a net profit of less than 80 million yuan in 2022, accounting for as high as 66.67%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Of the four companies withdrawn from the Science and Technology Innovation Board, three have suffered losses in the past two years. Among them, Shugen Internet Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as &quot;Sroot Internet&quot;), a hard-core technology company focusing on software applications, has no choice but to withdraw. Its losses since 2021 have been more than 700 million yuan. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“For a hard technology company like Shugen Internet, which has suffered huge losses year after year, it is naturally impossible for it to be listed on the main board or GEM. However, it has stepped on the industry trend supported by policies and placed itself on the During the loose period of IPO, it was possible to rush forward according to the fifth set of standards of the Science and Technology Innovation Board, but now that the fifth set of standards is suspended, its listing process can only come to an end.&quot; Baodai said bluntly. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is worth noting that the fifth set of standards of the Science and Technology Innovation Board is not universal, but a green channel specially opened for star companies in special industries. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to the requirements, companies that meet the fifth set of standards need to &quot;break through key core technologies and possess original leading technologies.&quot; Such companies may be listed on the Science and Technology Innovation Board even if they are in the research and development stage without generating revenue. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;As Baodai said, the fifth set of standards is now suspended, which means that regardless of the technological attributes of a company, if it wants to go public, it must not suffer a significant loss, and must even maintain a stable net profit. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“For companies, it will be more difficult to go public and subsequent financing will become more difficult; for investment banks, the number of projects that can be sponsored will decrease and underwriting income will decline. Naturally, they will suffer losses and do not want to see it. &quot;Another industry insider told reporters, &quot;But for investors, it is a kind of protection. Excluding loss-making companies and companies with relatively low profitability from the stock market will, on the one hand, effectively improve the quality of newly listed companies. It helps investors select high-quality stocks; on the other hand, it forces more funds to flow into existing stocks, which helps stabilize stock prices.&quot;&lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.infzm.com/cms /medias/image/23/09/12/e594ea773537f379c1452f71c5c2b28e.jpeg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;opacity: 1;&quot; width=&quot;1000&quot; height=&quot;606&quot; data-src=&quot;//images.infzm.com /cms/medias/image/23/09/12/e594ea773537f379c1452f71c5c2b28e.jpeg&quot; data-key=&quot;250412&quot;>;&lt;/p>; &lt;p style=&quot;color: #999999; text-align: center;&quot;>;&lt;span>; Image source: Visual China&lt;/span>;&lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Capital-driven companies have little hope of going public&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;According to investment bank insurance agents, in addition to the increase in net profit requirements, the number of years on the market is also a factor in whether a company can succeed. IPO assessment factors. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;“The purpose of assessing the number of years on the market is to determine whether the company is capital-driven.” An investment bank insurance agent told reporters. At present, in addition to emerging fields, hard technology and other industries, regulators expect listed companies to be established for more than ten or even twenty years, rely on their own strength to become stronger and bigger, and become leaders in subdivided industries before listing. Instead of relying on multiple rounds of financing driven by capital, IPO can be achieved in just a few years. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;The reason for this is that the insurance agent believes that there are two main points: on the one hand, from the perspective of the purpose of listing, compared with companies that have been operating for many years and then apply for listing, companies that have been established for a shorter period of time and rely on capital to promote, After listing, there is a greater probability that relevant shareholders will reduce their holdings and cash out. On the other hand, companies that have been established for a longer time are more likely to enter the maturity stage, have more stable operating performance, and have relatively less risk of performance changes after listing, which is more conducive to safeguarding the interests of investors. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to Wind, as of September 10, among the 36 IPO projects that have been withdrawn since July 24, 7 projects are located in companies that have been established within 10 years, and 5 were established in 2016 or 2017. Newly established in the year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among them, Zhejiang Tongfute Meike Household Products Co., Ltd., which was established in 2017 and plans to be listed on the main board of the Shanghai Stock Exchange, has performed well in terms of operating income and net profit in recent years. A net profit of 126 million yuan was achieved in 2021, and the net profit in the first half of last year reached 97 million yuan; operating income is also relatively high, with operating income of 1.948 billion yuan for the whole year of 2021, and operating income from January to June 2022 totaling 916 million yuan. Since 2020, operating income and net profit have increased by more than 20% year-on-year. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;However, the above-mentioned insurance agent also mentioned that the age of establishment is an important factor in whether a company can successfully IPO, but it is not an absolute factor. If the company has good quality, stable ability to continue operating, and broad prospects in the field, even if it is only established for In a few years, there is also the possibility of going public. &lt;/p>; &lt;h4>;Food, clothing, housing, and pharmaceutical companies concentrated on withdrawing orders&lt;/h4>; &lt;p>;In mid-August, there was news in the market that there was basically no hope of IPO listing of new shares of food, clothing, housing, and housing companies. At that time, the relevant cancellation data was not yet clear. Now, this statement is gradually supported. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;According to Wind, from September 4th to 6th, three food companies stopped IPOing, one of which has a net profit of over 100 million since 2021 and continues to grow. If the statistical time is advanced to August 14, the number of food, clothing and housing companies that have been forced to terminate the IPO process will reach 7. All seven companies plan to list on the Shanghai Stock Exchange main board. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since July 24, a total of 11 companies have withdrawn orders from the Shanghai Stock Exchange main board. This means that among the companies with orders withdrawn from the main board of the Shanghai Stock Exchange, companies related to food, clothing and housing account for more than 60%. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Among them, Ocean Family (Zhejiang) Co., Ltd., which terminated its IPO on August 14, was established in 2009. Since 2020, its net profit has been the lowest at 198 million yuan and operating income at the lowest at 1.835 billion yuan. Its performance far exceeds Motherboard profit requirements. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;It is worth noting that, judging from the industries of the companies that have withdrawn orders, in addition to clothing, food and housing companies, pharmaceutical companies with good operating performance and longer establishment years also have relatively more cancellations. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Since July 24, a total of four pharmaceutical manufacturing companies have terminated the IPO process. Among them, Fujian Mindong Lijiexun Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., which is preparing for the GEM, was established in 1997. From 2020 to 2022, its net profits were 87 million yuan, 73 million yuan and 98 million yuan respectively, far exceeding those on the GEM. Profit requirements, wipe existing profit standards. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;Tianjin Tongrentang, a time-honored brand in the traditional Chinese medicine industry founded in 1981, also failed to go public as expected. Its operating income and net profit have increased year by year since 2020. From January to June this year, operating income and net profit have reached 577 million yuan and 144 million yuan respectively, which is several times higher than the profit requirements of the GEM. &lt;/p>; &lt;p>;&lt;/p>;&lt;br>;&lt;hr>;&lt;div>;Get more RSS:&lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.net&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target= &quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx.net&lt;/a>; &lt;br>;&lt;a href=&quot;https://feedx.best&quot; style=&quot;color:orange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>;https://feedx. best&lt;/a>;&lt;br>;&lt;/div>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 13 Sep 2023 12:25:03 +0800</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
